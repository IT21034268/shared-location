5,A Good Classic,Story that shares the horror and the limits we should have in science. A creature that was created by the desire of a scientist to give life to a dead body. Soon the Innocent creature turns to evil after his creator abandoned him because of his disgusting looks and horror. After a year of searching the creature find his creator and take his revenge.
2,I know the secret of animating dead matter... But I'm not going to tell you...,So here's a story about a really smart guy who figured how to make a man from scratch. You would think he'd have enough balls to not run away from what he created because it was a bit ugly. I guess he donated those to his creature.I'm glad I read this book because it is something I should have read when I was younger but I didn't care for how Frankenstein behaved in the story. For such a brilliant mind he sure acted like an idiot throughout the story which I believe makes him more responsible for the deaths of his family and friends than his creation.
2,Not particularly entertaining,"Okay, I can see the romanticism that is covered with this book but I cannot fidn the entertainment that is supposed to lie in every single book upon this earth. I am 15, and sitting here reading (and sleeping to) this book was just an absolute waste of time. The book was filled with constant tautology (constant repition of the same thing, just in different words) and filled with chapters that were utterly pointless. There is no horror to this story at all...It is about a living creature, shunned by society who eventually goes on the rampage. Gee, like that hasn't happened before. The story was generic, even for it's time. I think Mary was desperate, considering that the book wasn't even liked in the first place by the original romanticists authors of that time."
1,"frankenstein, as read by a court stenographer","i am getting into books on cd, as i hike a lot. listening to a book on cd while hiking is so relaxing ---- unfortunately, the narrator of this wonderful story sounds more like some guy reading instructions on how to assemble a machine, or install a heater, or the like. although his enunciation is perfect, he's horrid at putting anything of himself into the story. unless he truly is as boring, mechanical, and flat as his reading sounds.i don't understand how people can tolerate his droning."
3,Words Words Words,"While this classic book is considered to be one of the great masterpieces, I do not understand it. The plot has an ingenius concept, I admit that, but the wording is, well, too wordy. I'd rather read a summarization of the whole thing. The underlying ideas are enough to keep you reading for quite some time, but there was a point when I knew I had 70 pages to go and I considered quitting. Those last 70 could have been spent reading a wonderful classic monster tale...Dracula!"
2,TakeThePain-FlowTheDisdain,"God almighty. This book was a struggle. At points, i was halfway into it, but unfortunately, Shelley always said, ""No, stay an armlength away from me."" I think the main thing i hated about it was how Victor was always saying, ""Oh, and my heart was always troubled. The monster led me to my self-destruction and doom."" Shelley wrote this so the readers might sympathise with his plight, yet she should've paid attention to the saying, ""Show, Don't Tell."" And the constant ""Words cannot describe the sorrow i felt,"" really did bug me as well. If you're published, that is, slap-bang in the middle of an industry based around words, you SHOULD be able to describe stuff, else you shouldn't be in the business. Maybe i just couldn't indentify with such an old book. Though i could with A Tale of Two Cities. Who knows? Don't read this book."
2,Strange,"A book that I always wanted to read, I should have left it on the shelf gathering dust. A very lengthy Preface, the name Frankenstein was not used until late in the 3rd chapter. First 3 chapters were extremely difficult to follow. The author's style was a bit bizarre. I think I'll stick to the movie for this one. I'm hoping it gets better the further in I go. I'm amazed they were able to write a screenplay based on this book. WOW."
2,The Myth Is Better,"I'm probably biased, because I hate the romantic period for its namby-pamby emotional fireworks, and I think Frankenstein epitomizes that. Everything is so dramatic to the point of being histrionic, and annoyingly so. Honestly, the author's life and the inspirations for the novel were a lot more interesting than the novel itself, which was neither scary nor emotionally involving. If anything, I felt little besides sheer ire toward the protagonists. This book awakened my schadenfreude. Unless you have to read it for school or something, stick to the legend of Frankenstein as the monster, not his creator."
1,Wrong item sent (but did receive credit.),"I did not receive the exact book I ordered. They sent an ""illustrated version"" which is not what I ordered. I did receive credit, however the company still sent me an email stating that I received what I ordered (which I did not.) Instead of saying they were sorry that I did not receive what I ordered they had to make that little comment which really annoyed me. I will not order from ""thevillagebookstore"" again.Sometimes a bargin is good and sometimes it is not, this time it was not. Make sure you get what you ordered!"
1,Do not buy,"This book was a waste of money. I had to read this for schooland did horrible on all my quizes because the chapters left outso much information that was needed and changed all the diction it was impossible to understand. Chapter 2 is in the middle ofchapter 1, and chapter 3 is really chapter 4 its just really confusing.I will never buy an enriched classic again. I should have justwent to books-a-million or barnes and noble.not recommended if needed for school studies."
1,ick,"although dover thrift editions are good for those of us who have very little money, i want to warn others, like me, who are not willing to scrape the bottom of the barrel. i made the mistake of ordering this and the symposium thrift editions and do regret it... i should have known that holding this book in my hands would be frustrating due to its awkward size and pagination. the words are crammed together and difficult to look at. (these cheapies make one aware that there is something to the art of publishing.) if you are sure that there is no other way you will read these important works, then, by all means, go ahead... but if you have to give up that cup of coffee tomorrow morning instead of going the cheapest route: please do so! i don't think you will regret it!"
1,slow,"i ordered my item jan 5, and didn't get it until feb.2 slowest turnaround ive experienced yet.it even says that it may take up to 21 days. it was well over 21 days."
4,Frankenstein is a classic must-read,"Frankenstein is one of those books that makes the reader wonder how the author could have ever made this up. As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class. I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed. My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it. I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature. She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time. So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so."
4,mary shelleys frankenstein,"even though i do not read a lot of books, this one started out extremely difficult for me. as i continued to read it, it became very interesting and exciting. the ""old english"" style of talking is what threw me the hardest loop. I guess all in all, frankenstein was good reading and maybe in a couple of years i'd read it again."
2,A doctor who creates a monster from dead people,"This book is about a doctor who creates a monster from dead people. The monster walked around at night. The towns people were frightened because the monster was ugly and different from them. When the towns people chased him with a bat, the monster became frightened and started to fight back."
2,Extremely Boring,"Mary Shelley brings up a well argued topic. Who has the authority to bestow life upon a creature? That is about the only thing that holds water in the book. The book starts out boring................ and stays boring. She wants to write a chilling horror story or a romantic novel, but she only skims the surface. The only exciting thing about the book that gets you hooked is the vividly designed cover."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes!,"The idea of a mad scientist creating a human monster was a great idea--especially in the year 1816. However the book is boring...implausible...over-written...under-edited...and boring. So why is is so famous? Let's face it, today nobody would have heard of, much less read, this book if the 1931 movie hadn't made it famous; yet the book and the movie have very little in common. So why does it get such great reviews? Again, let's face it, the title is so famous that most people don't want to say that they don't get it. But there's very little to get, other than what you read into it--the emperor has no clothes! But credit to Shelley for a truly great idea."
2,"Needs some more ""brainstorming""...","Well, this book wasn't really what I expected. Even though it's my reading level, it was pretty easy to read. The letters are too bored (you can finish this book in 20 concentrated minutes...) and there shouldn't be any pictures because it cuts your imagination. The story isn't very elaborate. Everything happens too fast. I would reccomend this book for people who like a fast, bad, and a bit childish book. I don't want to insult or offend Mary Shelley but she could've had ""brainstormed"" a bit more...."
2,"Okay, but boring",It seemed to go on for a bit and I constantly had to look up the vocabulary.Decent book overall
3,The Adventures of Frankenstein,"I downloaded this book in agony, as it was required reading for English class. I however completed this book joyously. I found Shelley`s vocabulary enriching, and her tale very enticing."
4,Frankenstein,"I read this book only because it was required of me for a college course. It was rather difficult for me to get into it because the wording is very different than what I am use to reading. Once I got into it, I felt it was a very dark book. There where things that surprised me and humbled me as well. I now understand why it's one everyone should read."
3,Okay but need paper,I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
2,It was a hard read,"I got this on the Kindle. It's not an easy read, nor a happy one. It's filled with obsessive compulsion, depression, denial, murder, and God-playing by man. I found myself forwarding through it to get to the action. I know it's a classic, it's just not a writing style I'm used to. It's fun to say that I read it, but it wasn't a fun read. To each his own."
4,Read the book BEFORE you watch the movie,"This book is so much different than any movie has ever depicted the story. It is an amazing tale of a human's quest for knowledge that results in a loss of humanity. Frankenstein, while not the monster, may become the monster."
5,Frankenstein,"The leather bound book, the color, the design is awesome. I love this book and am reading it at tis time. Beautiful work. Product came in the condition stated and timely. Thank you"
4,Frankenstein,Took a few chapters to get into the book however certainly worth it. Good character development and enjoyed the build to the end.
4,Handsome Leatherette Edition,"Nice edition of Frankenstein for your collection. It is a good quality leatherette that feels nice, but it is not leather. The leatherette is very thin and will wear off the corners and binding. The paper is medium weight. The font is large size. The binding is not very strong. The cloth ribbon is the extra narrow. It might actually be considered a wide thread rather than a ribbon. It is much narrower than the one pictured. The book is comparable in quality to the Barnes and Noble leather series...but with much bigger font."
3,You get what you pay..,"It's a good purchase but the quality of the book worries me. The glue along the binding is already breaking off and separating from the book. The book mark ribbon is too delicate and cheap. The gold on the page edges makes pages stick and is poorly done and the ""leather"" covering is cheap."
4,Frankenstein,"A very interesting take on a old classic. Different to what I expected, but a very interesting read. Would recommend it."
4,Frankenstein,"Frankenstein is well written and very thought provoking. The language is descriptive and poetic. I recommended it to everyone, especially if you enjoy classic literature."
4,A classic,"Once I used to the stilted language (apparently typical for the time - ""Dracula"" was written almost identically) this became a gripping tale. If the author had reduced the narrative about the characters' feelings about the natural features around them near the end of the book, by which time I'd more than enough, I would rate it five stars."
5,It still holds up,"I picked up Frankenstein as sort of a ""project"" read... I felt like it was such a ""classic"" that I ought to understand it more than the pop-culture monster image.I was surprised to find a book that holds its own extremely well some 100 years later. The message of scientific experiment for curiosity's sake is a profound one, especially in this age of nuclear experimentation, biological warfare and the like. It is also compelling as a story in and of itself.Although I was well-aware that the Boris Karloff image was a far cry from Mary Shelly's novel, I was still surprised to find such full character development and strong motivation. Despite the fact that this was her first effort, and based upon a whimsical challenge to write a ""ghost story"", it is compelling and well written. If you haven't read this book, don't be put off by it's age. It is exceptional."
3,This is an average book.,"When I started reading Frankenstein I was a little bit bored, but I expected it to pick up since it is such a popular book. When I got about half way through the book I had gotten a little more into it, but I was still bored. The action scenes that it did have were good though, that is why I gave it three stars. Pretty much all of the parts when there wasn't anything going on but talking I was bored because they weren't talking excitingly. Another thing that I didn't like is that ""Frankenstein"" made out ot be a horror, but the demon only kills four people in the entire book. Also, when the demon did kill somebody they didn't describe it. It was just something like ""I heard screams and went into the room; there she laid dead,"" or something to that effect."
2,"grand idea , very poor writing.",what an interesting book! I found the plot extraordinarily intriguing.But the writing IS indeed awful and repetitive.I think quater of the book should be ilimitated in order to spear the reader Victor's never ending wining.
1,THIS IS NOT FRANKENSTEIN,The Enriched Classic versions are bastardized misrepresentations of the original text. My school district has lost a tidy sum and will have to replace the books with a different edition. Mike Hightower English Teacher Moscow Senior High School
3,Frankenstein Opinion,"My daughter had to read this book over the summer for a grade in her Honors English class. I liked the fact that it was cheap, but on the other hand, what I paid for shipping I could have went ahead and purchased it out of the store. I wasn't to thrilled about that!"
3,The Modern... Bob?,"Does anyone remember that television show ""Kablam""? There was a sub-program on it called ""Prometheus and Bob,"" where Prometheus was an alien and Bob was a caveman. Bob was always doing stupid things with the technology that Prometheus brought for him. Well, another name for ""Frankenstein"" was ""The Modern Prometheus."" However, a more appropriate name for ""Frankenstein"" would be ""The Modern Bob"" because this book did a horrible job of portraying the nightmarish scenes that could have put the book at its full potential. In laymen's terms, it did stupid things with the abilities of Mary Shelley. If anyone is looking for a book to read, he or she would be better off reading ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald or ""Rebecca"" by Daphne Du Maurier. Please avoid wasting your time by reading ""Frankenstein""... or should I say ""The Modern Bob""?"
1,THE WRONG ITEM!!!!,I ORDERED THIS BOOK FOR A CLASS. AND WHEN I RECIEVED THE BOOK IT WAS THE WRONG VERSION WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY ADVERTISED AS THE CORRECT ITEM!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!
2,way overrated,"there is a certain degree of philosophy in this one. man is not good. our man is taking his experiments too far, wanting to make a human, using body parts from dead people. it lives of course. it escapes. learns to read and write. decides to find its master. the conflict deepesn. although the plot is interesting, it is not carried out that well. the psychology is lost somewhere. i just don't buy it, because there is really nothing to buy. the ""monster""'s role gets abit unclear, and some of the philosphical elements are lost. it gets a bit stilted. the plot IS interesting, but it just isn't worked well. it all becomes kind of blurred. THIS IS NOT A HORROR NOVEL. it really is not, as stated by a true horror master: H.P.Lovecraft. it is a philosophical supernatural drama. if you want a horror novel, you are looking in the wrong direction. i agree there is something grizzly here, but that does not make horror."
1,frankenstein stinks,ok this book does not deserve the title of a horror story its not scary in the leat bit. so all y'all who think this book will send chills up your spine IT WONT! READ DRACULA ITS WY BETTER!frankenstein isjust plain sad and depressing
5,Excellent tale of good and evil,"I believe at the time that this was written, that readers were expected to come away from reading this book with a sense that people should not try to emulate God by creating their own life from scratch. And in such, readers were supposed to empathasize with the monster and shun the doctor. I had the opposite reaction. Initially I had pity for the monster but it slowly disolved as the story wore on. I felt pity for the doctor. I think this is one of the classic stories of good versus evil. And the fact that the interpretation of who is good and who is evil is up to each individual reader. And it's because of this that this is one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommend it."
3,A little disappointing,"This has to be one of the rare occurances where the movie actually surpasses the book. While there's no denying it was an incredible idea, particularly for 19 year old girl written so very long ago, I found the language inpenetrable, repetitive and rather unsettling.Much of this book is written in a philosophical tone and the reader is expected to wade through page upon page of the internal workings of the central protagonist, Victor Frankenstein. In spite of this, I felt incredibly distanced from him due the language used to describe his emotions.Nonetheless, the book's themes are fascinating and insightful. It is basically a story of how a man's arrogance and thirst for knowledge leads him to meddle with nature, and what tragedy this causes both for him and the being he creates. The idea was enough to captivate me and spur me on to finish the book; it almost makes up for Mary Shelley's unlikeable style - but not quite."
3,"Great plot, confusing writing style","I read this book in 9th grade as a requirement. I enjoyed the plot, but the older English and vocabulary were utterly impossible to follow. The constant feeling of despair and pesimism is enough to stress you tremendously. The story, itself, however, is wonderful. You can decide whether Victor Frankenstein is the monster or whether his creation is the monster."
3,Mostly as promised!!!,"The book was in the condition it was promised, but it took a lot longer to recieve it then expected. However, the seller was very responsive and helpful.."
2,Reading with Tequila,"I did not enjoy this book. I should have and probably would have if I hadn't seen so many Frankenstein movies. I knew that the movies veered pretty far from the actual plot of the book, but still expected something more. While the book was probably very scary and very controversial in 1818, it didn't really translate through the centuries. At least for me it didn't. I rated this book based more for being a horror classic and for basically inventing the creature feature horror genre and less on actual entertainment and merit."
4,Better than the movies,"As with many of the other reviews for this novel, I too was surprised to find that the original character bore little resemblance to the movie representation. This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech. While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure. It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility. This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them. There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help. I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions."
4,A Good Book,"I studied this book, ""Frankenstein"", in my 12th Grade English Literature class. There are some slow parts, but overall an adventure to read. Victor Frankenstein's family at the beginning, his ""nervous fevers"", how he created the monster and became obsessed with his work, his marriage to his cousin, Elizabeth, etc...it's all there, but the reader such as myself has more sympathy for the monster than Frankenstein himself because of the monster's longing for love. It's a good book for students and anyone who enjoys tragedies (it doesn't really seem to be like a horror story though)."
2,Forced to read,If you're not force to read this for school I wouldn't recommend reading it. Not a very exciting ending either
2,I disliked,"There's nothing wrong with this version, not that I noticed- I just hated the book. I was barracking for the monster!"
5,Effect of Frankenstein,"What can you say about Frankenstein? Mary Shelley was truly an inspiring author, she is probably one of the greatest authors of our time. The way she described the monster, Frankenstein, and many other characters in the book. If you have not read this book yet, you should be deeply ashamed, it taught me so many things about life and how precious it is. Frankenstein is about a young man who creates a monster, the monster is very lonely and as a result begins to kill Dr. Frankensteins family and friends. Loneliness can be a small thing to some people, or can be a big thing. This is why we need to take part in the world today and comfort the lonely, sad, or self-distrout. If we don't, there is no telling what may happen. I strongly encourage every person to read this book, it will keep your interest going and I guarantee you won't be able to put the book down."
3,Frankenstein-- the book,"After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book by the original author.The book was very detailed, and it was hard to keep interested in the story, even though I knew the plot from the movie. I was only able to finish about three-fourths of the book."
3,Depressing and thought-provoking,"This was a classic I had heard about and seen/heard popular culture tell, but had never read for myself. What surprised me the most was that there was no assistant, no Igor. Also that Frankenstein hated what he had created. The book had many pages of remorse and it is very gloomy and sad. So much death and sadness created by giving life to something that should not be alive. I think Mary Shelley is trying to warn us that God is the only One who can create life. When we try, bad things happen. I don't think I'd read this again, but glad I did at least once."
2,"Good book, terrible shipping","book came shredded apart, it was a great book however, though, wish it wasn't a puzzle piece when I got it."
3,Tried to Like It,"My high school son had to read this so i bought it. I had never read it and considered it a book all readers must read, but i really did not enjoy it."
3,Frankenstein (Enriched Classics),reasonable price and a good book quality.the plot is sorta boring and its been 2 years and my sister haven't finish the book...
3,Frankenstein,"Overall, I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed reading the novel. I was a little skeptic at first since it was written so long ago, and also because I already had an idea in my head of what the book should be like. Although the book started off slow and some parts tended to be very drawn out, it began to pick up towards the middle and it became much easier to read. I liked how the author allowed us to see from the creature's perspective and were able to sympathize with him. This was my favorite part of novel because it makes you want to find out what happens in the end. The novel can definitely be related to society in the way that people that are not considered the ""norm"" are treated. I felt the novel was a good learning tool to different ways a book can be interpreted."
4,M.Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN,"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein was pretty good. Although, many times i found my mind wandering to other things. It was somewhat slow paced, and at times very boring. I felt Mary Shelly left out some things that perhaps should have been discussed in order for the book to be a little more interesting (ie. how the monster actually came to life). Even though the story was short, and unbelieveable i did however like how she made the monster a product of society- everyone hated and feared him, therefore he hated everyone else. He could have been good, and lived a (somewhat) normal life. The story has a deep meaning to it- it just took M. Shelly a long time to bring it out. I would recommend this book if you like science fiction."
4,Book review for Intro to Fiction,"Over all I felt that this novel was rather captivating. At all times Shelley is able to hold the reader in suspens and then jump into vivid details about the accounts of the story and the journey of Victor Frankenstein and his creation. I would not consider this to be a horror story as much as it is a drama story with its fair share of action. Shelley also lets the reader gain a personal attachment to each of the characters in the story by enclosing very detailed descriptions of their physical and personal attributes. As the story progresses the reader can begin to sympathise with the characters which creates a rising interest for the duration of the novel. Because this book has many different scopes that can be examined and critiqued, I would highly recomend this book to readers from 7th grade on up through professional levels of literature. One of the best books that I have ever read."
3,A glorified letdown,"This book doesn't live up to its title of ""classic"", in my opinion. I guess I expected just a little bit more..."
2,"Good Literature, But Bad Moral","I was assigned this book for homework. It was an interesting read. Its not one of those ""feel-good"" books. Mary Shelley portrays the world-view of ""The way you act, good or bad, is based on how you are treated by others."" According to Shelley, if you are rejected by the world, hated by others, and despised by your own creator, its ""ok"" to murder innocent people and hate those who are happy and have joy. I disagree with this world-view and wouldn't recommend this book to a friend."
3,"Shelley's ""Frankenstein""","I'm glad I read it, although I doubt I'll ever read it again. The style of the writing -- Walton telling his sister the story told to him by Frankenstein -- did little to engage my interest. The separation of the narrative from any action slowed the pace of the story to a crawl, which is why it took me so long to finish. This was very much a chore to read, and Frankenstein struck me as one of the most sniveling, pathetic characters ever written, but I enjoyed the descriptive language, the characterization of Frankenstein's creation, and the last chapter, which did much to redeem the book as a whole."
3,Frankenstein,I agree with other reviews that the binding is sloppy. It feels like the book is going to come apart.
4,Frankenstein,"Absolutely loved the book, nothing like the movies,you can really connect and empathise with the creature about being shunned by his creator, and about wanting the things that all humans aspire to."
4,Dry at times but still a classic,"I wanted to read much of the free books with my new kindle and I started with this edition of Frankenstein. It was a slow start to a book which I imagined would be amazing based on its popularity. It took me over a month to get through it because of the less suspenseful moments. I started two other books before finishing this one. However when the book picked up it was a great read. Also confusing at time to who was speaking and the dialect made me review much of what I had already read.This edition was free and I love free books.In reading this book you must remember it is taking place over 200 years ago and the dialect is far superior to most writings of today, so some dictionary searches may be necessary. Even though it was not as good of a read as I expected I would still recommend it to anyone who wants to read the classics."
5,Seemed good to me,"This was the first time I had read Frankenstein, so I don't know if this free Kindle version is true to the original. As far as I could tell, there were no gaps in the story and no missing plots. The formatting was good, although I don't believe there is a table of contents so you can't navigate by chapters."
4,Electrifying,"Wow. How did I reach the age of 43 without realising ""Frankenstein"" is so much more than a one-dimensional horror story about a blockheaded monster with bolts in his neck? The ""fiend"" reads poetry, longs for companionship, admires kindness and gentleness. Is he evil, or just lonely and misunderstood? Either way, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night."
3,Frankenstein,"This book would be awesome, if it wasn't for the fact that it came scratched. It's a Christmas gift though, so no time to try to return it. Over all I'm happy with the look of the book, just disappointed that it's marked up."
3,"Truly a masterpiece, well done, yet a total mind-f**k","This book was both a masterpiece in the style it was written in, yet both a total mind-f**k in the plot set up. Overall, I give this book 3 stars for it was not entirely interesting to me, included a lot of ""filler"" scenes, yet kept the plot twisted enough to keep me reading. Not a bad book if you want to hear the real side of Frankenstein and his twisted thoughts in the Dr. Jeckle - Mr. Hyde relationship, but also the realization that man is almost entirely greedy and selfish."
4,Great story,I picked this up because it was free and I have not read it in years so I thought it would be a good choice to learn to navigate with on my K2. I tried differnt methods but I really enjoyed readimg along with TTS. Beacuse the language is dated ( though in a good way ) it can make it a little tiring in places. With the TTS on I sailed through this book and loved it.
4,So close to being the best...,"This book was so close to being the best horror novel ever written. It just lacked a couple of things. The most important being a good description of what the monster looked like, granted it was fun to make up the image yourself. One of the reasons why I personally think it is a bit on the short side and does lack some description is that it was written for a friendly writing contest by Mary Shelly, her husband and some friends. However anyone who considers themselves well read even if they are not a fan of horror should read this book. It is very good and at only just over 200 pgs (most editions) it is not a time consuming book."
4,Frankenstein review,"I think that ""Frankenstein"" is worthy reading material at nearly any level. Besides a short portion in the middle of the story, this book stays rather interesting throughout. I especially enjoyed the character Victor. His emotions, thoughts, and reactions to his creation are convincingly real. Also, I liked the fact this book did tend to keep the reader a little chilled and anxious. I feel that this book is appropriate for high school or college courses and is surely a great leisurely read."
4,"A timeless, brilliant young writer",This classic reflects Mary Shelley's mental anguish and pain which she endured in her own life. What a powerful yet dark masterpiece from a young woman.
1,Wrong version,Got the wrong version and had to get the book somewhere else. I wasted my time and money on this purchase.
3,frankenstein,frankenstein AD Book. The story line was fair to good at best. The price of the Audio book was the best deal.
1,You'll find no Monster here,"The book ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley is a steaming pile of crap. on so many levels!It's a complete cop out to pass time in the book by having your main character faint and go into a 3 month long fevered coma MULTIPLE times! just because they're upset?? More like they've got some sort of tumor that needs looking into!Also, how can you write a THIRTY page intro to your book, explaining that it was an attempt to match the spooky campfire ghost stories you heard on vacation... and then create a monster who's demeanor and diction put shakespear to shame!Call me old fashioned by I'll take my Frankenstein monster with a side of Grandpa Munster!"
1,Don't believe the hype ...,"I'm sure that I'll have people wanting my blood for this, but I have to be honest. This book is horrible. Absoulutely horrible from start to finish. The writing is grade-schoolish, the plot moves to slowly and is so far fetched that one can't lose one's suspension of disbelief no matter how hard the reater tries, and frankly the monster itself is sleep-inducing.Don't bother with this book. For that matter, don't bother with the movies either. Frankenstein, the book and all things spawned from this book, is the single most overrated work in literature."
1,BORING,"I had to read this book in school, and it was the worst book I ever read. It had no plot and went on and on saying ten pages of what we could say in one line. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,not good,If I did not have to read this for school I never would have read it. It was an interesting story line but horribly and not understandably written and is one of the worst books I have read in a while.
1,'fraid the movie was way better.,"I was very disappointed. I had seen the movie, and usually, if I like the movie, I like the book even better, but this time they really improved on the book. I found the book incredibly boring. I had to force myself to finish it. I've read other books written in the same format -- mostly letters back and forth between people -- and enjoyed them. Bram Stoker's Dracula was written largely like that. But Mary Shelley is just not a very good writer, in my humble opinion. She had a good idea, and other people have done great things with it. But the original book just didn't do much for me."
1,amazon service way below par,"I ordered a copy of Frankenstein but was billed for seven copies because Amazon accused me of having clicked the order button more than once. I will take this opportunity to accuse Amazon of thoughtfully or thoughtlessly having created the possibility of more than one order per click, a reality that could indeed happen with a purchaser who has a tremor or who quite accidentally clicks the order button more than once. That's a sad trap for customers who don't pay close attention to the orders they receive, thinking that Amazon sent an order in the customer's favor and the customer later not recognizing the reality of what happened and end up paying the full amount of the credit card invoice."
1,Sucks Sucks Sucks,"I have to add this to the top of the list of books that I have had to read but HATED! Let's see it was up there with Call of the Wild, The Odyssey, Farenheit 451, The King Must Die, True Grit, When the Legends Die, etc...I think you get my point. It is as if the teachers and district pick the worst possible books. Frankenstein has SOOO much potential to be great, however it falls abysmally short. I am sad to say that I had to read this horrible book front to back without the option of throwing it in the fireplace like I was so longing to do. We even had to read the lame(for lack of better word) letters at the beginning. Our teacher said that most teachers don't make their students read those--I guess he is not one of those teachers."
3,It was a school reading book.,"Not much to say... it's Frankenstein. The chapters are arranged oddly (in a series of books rather than ongoing chapters.Personally didn't like the story... Frankenstein's monster's actions are questionable and everything is overdramatized. Ah well; that's the old style of writing for ya. Not exactly a ""horror"" book to me..."
3,Good Idea But...,"Mary Shelley had a great idea for Frankenstein... creation vs. creator is always an interesting topic, but Frankenstein is as dull as it gets! I had to read this book for school and I could barely get through it- the plot goes nowhere, and important parts of the book, such as the creation of the 'monster' happen very quickly. I had expected to read a true classic, but after reading it, I suggest watching one of the many movie versions despite their differences from the book."
3,"Glad I read it, but there was just a bit too much of it.","When I closed the book after reading the final page, I looked back at the novel and came to the conclusion that I did not regret reading it. With all the cheap conceptions people have today about Frankenstein, it was great to read this and fully understand what Frankenstein was ORIGINALLY meant to be! I liked the novel, but I found it at times to carry on just a little too much. Chunks of the novel could have been cut without any significant damage to the plot. I found myself fed up somewhere in the middle of the novel because of this, but at the end I was satisfied."
4,A wonderful book,The tale of a large cannon that falls into the hands of Spanish Guerilla's during the Napoleonic war. This books provides great insight into the conditions during the Peninsular War. It is not a dry history and not your typical Forester book. It focuses on the cannon's impact on many people instead of one individual like the Hornblower series. I have enjoyed rereading this book several times over the years.
2,"Great set, spoiled by subtitles","This is a fascinating collection of really beautiful animated films.Unfortunately, they are marred by some very obtrusive English subtitles, which CAN'T BE SWITCHED OFF, they are rendered into the video stream.This is deeply upsetting, because the value of the films is in their visual impact, not their text, and the ugly subtitles are ALL OVER the frame."
4,Garish and rabid fun,"This four-DVD release gathers together what may be some of the most ideologically garish cartoons of the 20th century. And yet, if you look past that and revel in the method and artistry of these animators, artists and directors, you will be amazed. In fact, these films often display rather daring artistic expression for their times - apparently permissible if the anti-Americanism was sufficiently rabid. (Reviewed inRussian Life)"
4,Blue Is Too Good For A Mere Comp,"For fans of great hard bop and intricate, intelligent horn arrangements, Blue Mitchell is simply too good for you to just buy this compilation. ""Blues On My Mind"" collects tunes from three of Mitchell's late 50s sessions, ""Big Six,"" ""Out Of The Blue"" and ""Blue Soul."" (In fact, the photo on the cover of this CD is the same one used on ""Blue Soul"" -- don't get confused.) I have written reviews for all three of these albums already so I won't get into details about the songs here, but suffice it to say the music is classic. In fact, it's so good that if you buy this title you'll surely want to get the three albums in their entirety. So do yourself a favor, skip this one and go directly to the source."
3,horrible tests but good info,"The information prestented is clear and concise, but the review questions at the end of the chapters are too easyThere are 4 solid tests at the end of the book, and they are very fair.This book has 4 exams and is therefore maybe more meaningful to you than Barron's or PR's.Only 3 stars because the quizzes at the end of the chapters were TOO easy (and I amv ery stingy)."
5,absolutely fascinating and still relevant,"It's great to read a scholarly study of shamanism that is neither dismissive of ""primitive"" cultures nor tainted with new age credulity.610 pages, indexed. Chapter headings include:Recruiting methods, shamanism and mystical vocationInitiatory sickness and dreamsObtaining shamanic powersshamanic initiationSymbolism of the shaman's costume and drumShamanism in Central and North Asia: Celestial ascents. Descents to the underworldMagical curesCosmologyShamanism in North and South AmericaSoutheast Asian And Oceanian shamanismShamanic Ideologies and techniques among Indo-EuropeansShamanic symbolisms and techniques in Tibet, china, and the Far EastParallel myths, symbols, and ritesConclusions, Epilogue, List of works cited"
3,Classic academic overview of traditional shamanism.,This book is considered the classic in its field. It's focus is on traditional shamanism worldwide. Contemporary writers such as Michael Harner and Tom Cowan have written more accessible books about the practice of core shamanism. I recommend that individuals seeking a general overview of shamanism begin with those authors and come back to this book for indepth scholarship.
1,Economics,"I would recommend getting the unterminated brand wires which don't come with such accessories as divorce, welfare, and starving children like this one has."
4,Better than a Big Green Egg,"First, there are a couple of problems with packaging and the instructions should contain appropriate warnings. Before opening the package, all conductors should have a low impedance path to ground attached. When I opened mine a static discharge jumped from my finger to the center conductor and the neighbor's dog was neutered by the shock. This was a prize breeder, and replacement was a serious hassle.In operation, I was quite satisfied with the cables. Normally I smoke a turkey for Christmas on my Big Green Egg. The Volcano cables allowed me to connect to the jacks on the back of the microwave and the turkey was cooked while still in the fridge in just under 2 hours. Unfortunately a container of Tuscan Milk was split open in the process."
1,don't waste your money...,"Tried these before I bought Audio Quest K2 cables (see my full review there)for $8,000. And yes- you do get what you pay for as the K2s are literally twice as good as the Volcanos. Anyway, tried pawning this cheap pair off on ebay, but then figured out how I could use them to make a killer electric bong with a Pepsi can and an old lava lamp. Cheers!"
1,Speakers sprouted wings and flew away:(,"Yep, you heard correct, my speakers sprouted wings and flew away into the great beyond and disappeared.Very sad experience and the worst part of it is is that I never actually heard these cables, once I plugged them in, turned receiver and stuff on they took off, gone, Vamoose, aloha, split, bye bye.The only good thing that came out of this experience is that the speakers are in a better place.still... sad day. Dont buy these."
3,"Nice overview, but spotty scholarship","It's a bit hard to take her discussion of the Shakers seriously considering she does not consult the scholarly work of Louis J. Kern. His penetrating insights would have illuminated this portion of her book further. Otherwise, this book does give the reader a sense of why one would become celibate in a certain place and at a certain time."
2,"review of 'Drive it Forever"" from a certified mechanic","I do agree with the other reviewer, that this books endorsement of slick 50 after being heavily penalized by the federal trade commission seems like the wrong way to help people. The information is fairly outdated in my opinion. Yes, it does have a few good points, but following your owners manuals recommendations would pretty much tell you the same thing."
2,"Padding, padding, padding...","If you drive a car made after 1985, or a car with automatic transmission, 90% of the information in this book is totally irrelevant. The author discusses carburetor maitanence and the finer points of gear shifting in exhaustive detail. It seems as if Mr. Sikorsky has put a TON of padding into a book that otherwise would be a good pamphlet on effecient driving habits. For instance, he wastes nearly 40 pages discussing the properties of different oil grades. WHO CARES!?! Mr. Sikorsky claims to have all the answers on protecting your automobile investment, but if I had it to do over again; I would invest the money I spent on this book elsewhere."
4,I learned something but exected more when I bought this book,"Yes, I did learn from Bob that :- Short trips and start-ups are hard on cars.- Mixing different grades of oil and conventional/sythetic is OK.- If something is not normal, find and fix the problem before it gets expensive.- Exessive warm-ups are bad.I was execting the author's to say more about maintaining and protecting the tranmission (ie. synthetic ATF, tranmission cooler) but found none. After all, next to the engine the most costly item to repair is the tranmission."
4,A unique perspective,To see the universe in a grain of sand...to see infinity in an instant...and to see nature in a prison. The first two have been contemplated by philosophers and laymen alike for years. Now Ken Lamberton brings us his insights on the third.In honesty I only bought the book because I had known the author in the time leading up to his incarseration and wasn't even sure if I would read the whole thing. I wound up reading it twice. The perspective is unique and the insights are thoughtful.As a transplanted Arizonan the descriptions of the desert of southern Arizona brought back wonderful memories for me as did the tremendous illustrations.As we get pushed further from nature this book is a wonderful reminder that even in the harshest most 'un-natural' environments we are never very far from the wild wonderfull natural world - we just sometimes have to look a little harder.
5,A Return to the Desert,My sister who lives in Arizona told me about this book after reading about it in the newspaper. She knew I had gained a great appreciation for the Desert after completing a 28 day survival trip in the southern desert of Utah about 20 years ago. Ken's book allowed me to regain some of the senses and feelings that I experienced while living in a world that has such a lack of appreciation. He certainly has an artistry for words that captured many of the experiences and emotions that were mine during those 28 days. I also have a fascination for the penal system and the affect that it has on a person. Ken validated how it is definitely not a place for rehabilitation but a place where time weighs on a person so heavily. I liked very much how he combined the Wilderness of the desert with the prison experience. It was an excellent book and I read it start to finish in one sitting.
2,Does not fit vehicle,"I bought this dash kit as part of an install for a 2009 Cobalt. The kit looks nice and mounts fine to the radio. However, this kit does not fit under the Cobalt dash panels. It appears there was a manufacturing error or incorrect labeling of this product. The face is about 1/4"" to wide and will not mount under the cars dash panel. It is not worth modifying since the face would have to be physically cut to fit under the dash panel. Cutting the hard plastic face would be very noticeable and cutting the car dash plate would be an unrepairable modification.I would like to give this product a ""2 star"" rating because it does well at securing the radio in the dash and is reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the dash panels could not be replaced with this mounting kit installed. My background includes several custom car audio installations and I am very confident in my ability. This does not fit in a late model Cobalt."
1,Does not fit Cobalt,this product does not fit the Cobalt- you have to use 95-3302 There is an error in the tags and links for this part. Do not buy for the Cobalt!!
4,Good kit,"This is a good kit. I used it on a 2008 Pontiac Torrent, and it fit quite well. It doesn't fit quite perfect, but that is the case with most kits like these. The black matches quite well with my car, it is a very matte black. The plastic bent quite a bit trying to secure it in place, but fit well once it was secured down."
2,Smell is cheap,"I purchased two Alba Botanica products (this lotion and a body scrub) and I did not like either. This lotion smells like a cheap cocoa butter smelling lotion. Why purchase a $10 tube of this for that smell? Also, it does a very basic job of moisturizing. Nothing special. I REALLY wanted to like both of these products based of the reviews but was dissapointed in both. I would recommend you smell the scent of this in a store and decide for yourself. Will be writing a review on the body scrub as well so feel free to check that one as well. My skin is naturally oily and accumulates ""stuff"" easily so I was looking for a scrub that worked for that, so if this describes your skin, please feel free to check out that review."
4,a really great product,"This product smells really, really good. Keep in mind that is does have a chocolaty hint to it. That can be a good or bad thing depending on the person.. But for me, it smells great! It feels nice and relaxing to smooth this lotion on your hands and arms. It definitely provides a lot of moisture. However, I lose moisture in my hands quickly and I have to reapply frequently. I can't seem to find a lotion that will solve this problem. But, this lotion does great short term moisturizing."
5,Very cute!,This bottle came fast and is exactly what the picture shows. It's hard to find Spanish baby things so this was a great find for us
5,EXCELLENT,I highly recommend this seller! Item just as described and fast shipping!! A++++++++++++++ Mahaloz!!!
2,If you care about Africa look elsewhere,"The author (mostly) writes about himself, and his plush life as an UN diplomat. His style is poor, his insights are predictable.There are so many books which could bring you understanding of this magnificent continent as Martin Meredith ""The Fate of Africa"" (history of every country on the continent since independence) or books by Kapuscinsky, if you want to understand how ordinary people live in Africa, rather than how wrong and dismal politics is made.There are few interesting observations World Bank envoy makes concerning how wrong international help could go. He points out that unconditional help makes things worse. He gives several revealing examples how undertakings supposed to bring good, make more misery instead."
1,Awful,"This book is chock full of arrogant, racist nonsense. No compelling evidence is provided to back up radical claims that purport to relieve colonial guilt but instead implicate the ravages of colonialism more vividly(read between the lines, of course)."
1,What A Stupid Book,My Sociology teacher assigned this book and after reading it my conclusion is that it is the stupidest book I've ever read. Calderisi doesn't know a thing about Africa. He should've called it A Story About My Life. Look elsewhere.
3,Average,"This spray worked just as well as some bissel spray that i had purchased for a couple dollars cheaper. It didnt get the mysterious red stains out of my carpet like the reviews said but it worked pretty well on stains that are fresh, like 30 seconds fresh. If you dont have small children who make big messes this is an amazing product but for my squad I need something different."
3,SO SO,I washed some boat seats with Simple Green and a splash of bleach and let them dry. I then tried this product and it really did not remove any more of the staining.
1,has it been sent ?,unaware there's been any progress with this being sent. No notification yet.This is a gift and I don't know if he's received it.
3,Decent sequel but ultimately forgettable,"I'm sure it seemed a good thing to do -- follow up on the success of ""Father of the Bride"" with a chapter two. There are a few fun moments here and it is nice to see the entire cast reunited, but the sequel lacks the strength of the original. It's decent but far from memorable.In this case, the Steve Martin remake, which diverges almost completely from the plot of the original (for good reasons), is more enjoyable. I found the end of this version, with Stanley misplacing the baby, a bit dark and not treated comically enough.Many reviewers have lamented the poor sound quality of the DVD. Well, with a decent sound system it ends up sounding like most VHS copies. What is more embarrassing, at least on this DVD packaging are errors in the trivia game -- they don't even get Ellie's name right! Did they even watch this movie?I'd actually like to see this reissued with a decent sound-track someday, but there are more important older movies to be revived first..."
2,father's little dividend,"Usally, the movies I order from you are very good. I liked this movie but,the quality of the dvd was very poor."
1,Quality is key,I wish I'd seen this site before I purchased this beloved classic. I wouldn't take this DVD from Alpha Video if they gave it away for free. They should be made to return the money of all who purchased it. I am sincere in stating that the picture/sound quality is less than a 3. The movie itself deserves so much better than this trash release. The one star I've given is only for the movie content(which itself is 5 star)
1,Horrible Transfer!,Pick another version at all costs! My wife wanted this movie since she loved the first one so much. She had read somewhere that this version was very good and she could not have been more wrong. The transfer is horribly washed out. Needless to say we will NEVER purchase a SYNERGY version again.I wish I could give it 0 Stars.Too bad a good movie was ruined by such a lousy DVD. UGH!
1,Terrible quality!!,This is a great movie but the quality of the this DVD is horrible! I got it for my collection of oldie but goodie movies and was disappointed when I sat down to watch it over the holidays. Do not buy this DVD from this particular company. Amazon should really remove it because it reflects badly on their reputation. I would not have given it star but the website requires it.
1,Don't Purchase this DVD,poorest quality I have ever seen..was shocked to see and know that Amazon is selling shoddy materials...bad bad bad..do not waste your money on this DVD
1,Horrible!!!,This dvd looked like a bootleg copy ten times removed. I could barely make out the facial features or still items like flowers on a table. THis could not have been an original copy of the movie. Will not return because it would cost more to send it back to importdvd. I gave it one star because it arrived very quickly.
1,Poor film quality,"I love this movie. However, this DVD has such poor film quality that it makes it hard to watch. It looks like the DVD was made from a film that had been watched too many times. I was very disappointed."
5,Father's Little Dividend DVD,"What a wonderful original to the ""Father of the Bride 2"". If you like the older movies, you will love this one! Spencer Tracey and Elizabeth Taylor are wonderful!"
2,Tries but never gets off the ground.,First the film it's self. It just had too much to live up to. I always laugh a lot watching the first film. All involved were in top form. And were working from a great script. Grins are about all I get here. Everyone tries but the script is WEAK. Ms. Taylor was so beautiful that I enjoyed just watching her and Mr. Tracy was one of the VERY BEST there has ever been. But just that won't make up for the thin script. Now the DVD transfer. The color is so bad everything looks pastel when any color other than green can be decerned. I watched this on a home theatre system and the sound was nothing special but alright. On a regular t.v. it would be pretty sub-par.
1,Use your cash as toilet paper.,"If you are thinking of getting this dvd, you might as well use your cash as toilet paper, because that is what you will be getting when you buy this, if you get my drift."
1,Poor Quality Media,"Very disappointed. While one of my favorite movies, it was almostunwatchable due to the poor audio and video. It was almost as if it were a tenth generation copy from a poor original. I will not buy anything else produced by this company."
1,Wonderful Movie but DVD is DREADFUL! Don't Buy this!,How to ruin a perfectly marvelous movie? Make a poor quality DVD. The picture is so washed out most details are lost and the sound so low I had to turn up the volume to 99 just to hear it whisper. THIS DVD IS VERY BAD! Please just record this gem the next time it comes on TCM and save your money. It is a shame such a wonderful film has been treated in such a poor manner.
1,Disappointed,"The first time I saw this movie, it was on TV. I remembered enjoying it very much. This led to my purchasing the DVD. I was, however, very disappointed in the DVD. The quality of the recording was so bad I gave up half way through the movie. The picture quality was poor and the sound was even worse. It was difficult to understand the dialogue. I am sorry to report this. I was hoping for so much more."
1,don't buy Alpha Video products,I bought the movie Father's Little Dividend from Amazon made by Alpha Video. The picture was almost all bright light and the sound was terrible too. It was like a copy of a copy of a copy. I won't buy from Amazon again if I should receive another such poor quality product. I suggest to Amazon not to do business with Alpha Video.
1,Buyer Beware: Horrible Sound Quality,"This is a wonderful movie that I love watching. However, this version has the worst sound quality I have ever heard. The picture is fine, but the sound constantly goes up and down and even squeals at times. Either I got a bad DVD or all of the DVD's from this set are bad. I would not buy the DVD because of the sound."
1,BEWARE MADACY ENTERTAINMENT!!!,DO NOT buy this DVD. Another inferior product by Madacy: bleached out picture and tinny sound. Weren't DVD's supposed to be better quality than VHS?!?!
1,Extremely Poor Quality DVD,"I love this movie. I have the VHS version and wanted it on DVD. However, I will be keeping my VHS. This copy is dreadful. It is unviewable. I will never buy from Alpha Video again."
1,Father's Little Dividend,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD from SYNERGY ENT. The quality of reproduction was not even a consideration in the manufacturing of this product. This copy is unwatchable and almost painful to view. Save your time and money on this one. SYNERGY, are all of your offerings of this quality? If so, perhaps you should consider another occupation."
5,It is very good to read! Really it is.,"I loved this book and I keep reading this over and over I can never get enough of it. I really dont like to read but I picked this book up at a store and just read it over and over til it was time to close, which was about ten. So at the end I bought it because I just wanted to keep reading it. I have read the book at least 32 times. I love it because I wish I had a family like that. I might not have been in foster homes but I dont like where I am so to me this is a book that I wish I was in. I hope whoever reads the book realizes it is a very good book. 5 stars all the way. I am only 15 and I have not read too many books but this book got me into reading so it has to be good. I think I am repeating myself so I am gonna go. Later."
3,Its not bad,"Okay I havent actually bought this album, but from what I've listened to on Amazon, it sounds okay. I admit it, she cant sing but the songs are fun. She's presenting now on CBBC under her real name of Anna Kumble, and she's a good presenter. I dont know what all the bad reviews are about."
3,"Come on, it's not that bad!!!!","OK, OK, she can't sing, and her music might be annoying after a while. But I think that those 1-star ratings are a bit exagerated. There are some really bad tracks here (especially track 2) ; however some tracks aren't that bad. Of course it's far to be my favourite album. But it's not horrible. Tracks 1, 4, 5, 9, and 10 are actually OK! The others are so-so or even bad, but anyway I give 3 stars to this CD because there is much, MUCH worse than this. This CD would have been better if it included the Almighty Remix of ""Viva La Radio"" which is an excellent remix!! (You can find on the ""Viva La Radio"" single.)So you want to know if it's recommended or not? If you liked ""Viva La Radio"" then yes, if not, then avoid it. It depends of you."
3,I think it deserves three stars,"Hey why is everyone slating Lolly and just saying she is shocking. Okay so it's not the best album I've ever heard, but it's certainly not the worst. The fast paced pop songs such as Viva la Radio may get annoying after listening to it a few times, but thats what happens with most pop songs. However the slower songs such as Big Boys Don't Cry really show that this girl has got talent. She actually manages to reach the high notes which is more than can be said for some bands and artists. Almost all pop bands don't write their songs anyway so why are Steps that much better? At least Lolly is original! So I'm not saying go out and buy this album. But compared to all the other pop **** we have around nowadays, this CD is not actually that bad! My favourite song is Big Boys Don't Cry."
1,This is really bad holy crap!,"This is some of the crappiest junk I have ever heard. Thhe only reason that I gave it one star was beacuse there wasn't a zero. The only good thing about this CD is the Karaoke versions of all her songs. If you want a good pop singer from the UK get Billie Honey To The B it si alot better then this garbage. Also you might try some talented pop exports from the UK, S CLUB 7, STEPS, and try the Irish Samantha Mumba. They are all better then this pseudo talented pop trash."
4,"Very good, but wrong ending.","I purchased this blue ray and have been very impressed. The dancing is superb, as to be expected considering the source. You would be hard pressed to find better visual quality, and the music is impeccable. My only complaint is that this version of Swan Lake has a 'happy ending'. The music and story dictate tragedy. It should have been played out with a double suicide, and it wasn't."
1,Poor Craftmanship!,This 55 gallon Stand is Not made of cherry wood at all. It is all Pressed wood with plastic covering.
5,Great CD!,If you like modern jazz (after the swing era) you'll enjoy Gene Ammon's CD. There were hits on this CD that I did not even know was here! I love listening to it. Really mellow baby!
2,Canto: An unfortunate redaction of a timeless classic,"Don't get me wrong -- ""On Growth and Form"" is one of my absolute top favorite books of all time. Possibly my favorite book, in fact. This review is a warning to make sure you get the right imprint.Unfortunately some publishers think that they know better than D'Arcy Thompson, and cut out more than half of the original material. After all, nobody these days actually looks at equations, right? Well I do, and the pathetic edition by Canto (368 pages) weighs with less than 33% of the material in the modern unexpurgated reprint by Dover (1116 pages).Amazingly enough, the redacted Canto version costs nearly the same as the Dover complete. If you care about this material, take care to get all of it."
1,Unreadable because of poor production,"I wish I had read the reviews to this edition before I bought it because I would not have wasted my money. However, my complaint is different from that of the others I have read. The book I received? I literally can't read it. Imagine using a copier to copy the pages of a book, with the ""darkness"" factor set high. That's what I got. A grey background to every page. There is such poor contrast between the type and the page that it's all just a big wash of grey. What a disappointment. btw there was no publisher listed anywhere on this edition - nor any mention that it was abridged. I suspect it is an Amazonian ""on-demand"" printing, apparently overseen by a broken robot. I shall search out the unabridged edition elsewhere."
3,Oh for heaven's sake,"Bonner's abridgment is a fine introduction to an interesting book and is perhaps getting too bad a rap here; anyone who wants to compare it to the original 1917 edition (or the 1945 American edition) is welcome to hit the Internet archive and download either, since both are out of copyright and freely available."
1,Beware this edition,"This is about this edition not the book itself. What I received was literally unreadable. Imagine using a copier to copy the pages of a book, with the ""darkness"" factor set high. That's what I got. A grey background to every page. There is such poor contrast between the type and the page that it's all just a big wash of grey. What a disappointment."
3,Tae Bo Workout,If you like other advance workouts then you will like this product. It's the usual advanced routine that is fun while requiring you to use a lot of energy to keep up with the almost 60 min routine.
2,Stopped working after a few plays...,Now granted we did get this used but the reason we bought it was bc my boyfriends game had stopped working. Then when he started playing this one it did the same thing. It must be in how they made the game bc it has happened with several.
4,Good - But not as good as WoO,"For any dirt track racer or fan out there this is a must have. The gameplay is as good or better than WoO but unfortunately this game doesn't offer much that's new as far as tracks etc goes. A create a track feature would be nice and a variety of cars in the pure stock class would keep it more interesting. It is more realistic with it's engine damage but the car damage is still very unrealistic. I would also like to see more physics introduced like tire pressure, tire compound, toe and castor/camber settings etc. Good game with lots of areas to improve upon for the next release."
4,BJORK CAN ACT IN SPOOKY TALE,"Bjork, Iceland's eccentric and eclectic artist, singer and actress stars in ""THE JUNIPER TREE.""Shot in black and white on bleak locations in Iceland, the story is an old folk tale adapted from the Brothers Grimm archives. And grim it is. Bjork is Margit. When her mother is burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft, she and her older sister Katla flee across Iceland's rugged terrain until they reach the remote farmhouse owned by handsome widower Johann. Katla casts a seductive spell on Johann and bewitches him. Soon they are wed, much to the dismay of Johann's suspicious young son Jonas who sees clearly what has happened to his dad. Things get increasingly tense and Margit is forced into the spiritual world to save Jonas from Katla's supernatural wrath.This dark, brooding mystical tale is nicely visualized and Bjork is a natural actress. And yes, she sings. Extras include an interview with director Nietzchka Keene, deleted scenes and publicity photos."
2,Only for die-hard fans...,"""The Juniper Tree"" features Björk's first attempt at acting; though the movie is not very good, it is definitely worth taking a look at if only just to see Björk as a young actress! I would only recommend this movie to true Bjork fans!"
2,Hard to stay awake thru,"Movie is entirely in black and white. Very little dialogue. Very artsy. I had to watch it 5 times before I saw it all. Your not missing anything. Bjork is the only reason I watched, and even she wasn't enough. Without her I would have given 1 star. Get ""dancer in the dark"" instead."
2,The whole movie was unusually boring and unstimulating,"As an avid (or rabid) Bjork fan, I was hoping that her usual creativeness would show in this movie, but I was in for a surprise. The movie is extremely long and boring, not to mention drab in its presentation. There is little dialogue, little acting, and it is hard to watch all the way through."
2,Honestly...,"...Now, I've the utmost respect for Bjork's music and acting skills. Granted, she is decent enough in this. But this film would never have been released in the USA if she wasn't in it. ..."
5,NBA 2K7 will blow your mind!,"After playing 2K6 I was a bit hesistant to pick up 2K7. After doing my research between 2K7 and Live, the answer was pretty clear- my research proved to have worked out in my favor. 2K7 is simply sick!!! The game lives up to everything you see in the commercials. This game has every single player's ""trademark"" move wheter it is a sloppy jump shot to crossing over 50 times before you reach half court. The graphics are crazy- 60 FPS and some of the smothest gameplay I have ever experienced. PLUS for franchise dorks like myself there is three team trading! I can't wait to see what they add for next year. Definitly the NBA game to pick up this year."
5,NBA 2k7 (Xbox 360),"This game is awesome. When i got the game, it said that it was used, but it was wrapped up and everything, with no faults and no signs of usage (or an amazon sticker). I am glad that I ordered this product!"
4,Good game,"Is a good game, a lot of fun... but the graphics could be better. A litle bit squares in my XBOX 360 but very realistic control."
2,Does not instill confidence . . .,Although the text has many good points I am not confident that I can pass the test due to the many contradictions and errors encountered in the text and on the included CD-ROM. I have to ask myself if what I know is correct! I would not buy another Lammle book at this point . . .
1,...,This book is ... ..Full STOP!!it has not enough info.Info it has is not in enough detail+It contains wrong info and they are in alot of detail tooThe way it explains wild card in access list is just confusing... He doesn't even mention that it works in binary fomat which 0 represents checking and 1 means ignor..instead he made up this formula that are just impractical..He talks VLAN and ISL but no where does he mention how you can set up a vlan and ISL on routers and switches...I recommend Cisco press' ICND and certification guide...I bought this cert library which had those two books and internetworkikng tech hand book...it's awesome..with Sybex I failed by alot and with cisco books i got 95x..
3,"Average rating, becuase...","Lammle generalizes a great deal in this text. Yes, he covers the fundamentals, but fails to give more detail information concerning LAN design, LAN Switching, and WAN protocol compatibility.A text for beginners, but I would not rely on it alone for the examination...It is the details that will make you or break you on the exam..."
2,big disapointment....,"Mr. Lammle is still an excellent teacher/writer (the best), but the omission of some crucial material is a setup for test disaster. In particular there is little information on NAT, and zero configuration examples. 4 months ago I recertified on the CCNA and one of the simulation questions was NAT configuration and at least 3 multiple choice were on NAT router commands. I am now tutoring 4 other engineers using this book and we've had to use Cisco Press books to cover NAT and other material that is missing. The Simulator in this book will not do OSPF and EIGRP (both crucial, so we bought Mr. Lammle's routersim from www.routersim.com, this does allow these routing protocols, but VTP doesn't work correctly with the simulator switches. In hindsight I would definitely use Cisco Press now, it doesn't appear that Sybex is keeping up. The Cisco books aren't as well written or real world, but they have everything you need to pass the test."
4,Just about enough to pass the exam,"After reading user reviews here on Amazon, I realized that this book, the 4th edition, was lacking in some areas...most notably, NAT. This deluxe edition though, included the virtual lab which I thought would be important since I do not have actual equipment to practice on.I'm glad that I went this route. I passed the exam today using this book, the virtual labs, practice tests and bonus exams included on the two CDs. I took approximately 2.5 to 3 weeks to study. I enjoyed the way the book is written and layed out. At no time did I find myself falling asleep in material that was not presented well enough to keep me awake. I supplemented my education in the areas that others had complained about and past my 55 question test with room to spare.If you do not need nor want the virtual lab, go with the later 5th edition of this book."
1,Distracting writing style and lack of visual aids,The writing style of this book is informal and distracts from the training process. The author lacks basic grammatical skills leading me to wonder if the book was edited at all. A complete lack of visual aids makes many portions of the text excruciatingly difficult to understand.If you are seeking a professionally written textbook then you should continue shopping.
4,Can't Belive you would give this a 5 star rating,"Although this is a very good book, I still can't give it more that a 4 star rating. Could you pass the CCNA test with this book? ... I am sure you could, but be careful of the large number of errors or missing information. I would reccomend ""Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices"" by Cisco Press to help keep you on track with the right answers. The CD-ROM with Sample Tests and Flash-Cards also contain a lot of errors."
4,Routing Protocols,"I agree, if you want to learn IP routing, this book will not take you anywhere close. For that you would need ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton or Doyle's books. However, Lammle's book would probably be all you need to pass the CCNA test. Unless you're a complete beginner, then you may want to add one or two other fine CCNA books."
5,Amazing book with an amazing amount of information!,"This book is more like a whole self-study kit.It includes a Router Simulator and over 1000 practice exam questions and 500 flash cards. For the price you cannot beat this deal.Besides having the ""famous"" Todd Lammle's text, you get a huge amount of extras that I have not seen included in any other text ever!This is worth three or four times what they charge for this book, but don't tell them that!!"
4,Great book!,"if you are learning CCNA by yourself and have a ciscopress book, but just understand half of the stuff, this book clear any doubt about the subject, its written in natural language, easier to understand than any other book of networking."
1,Out Dated book,I used this book for review and am able to pass all the test questions in the cd included. I sat for my CCNA today and it the questions I got where not covered all that well in this book. The test coved Frame relay and OSPF heavly and this book did not cover it as well as need for the exam. In my oppinion you should use a more current released book that covers the new test format and as always use several study books and resources.
2,Yawn.,"Yes, I bought (okay, downladed...) this. ""Miss Independent"" is a pretty good song, though not exactly my type of song. I also loved ""You Thought Wrong"". Unfortunately, every other song wasn't that cool, and they were all pretty much the same as each other, and the same as everything else on the shelves these days. Come on, people, I want some fresh ideas! Yes, she's got a pretty good voice. But by the end of the CD, I was quite frankly bored out of my mind. But hey, if you like Kelly... that's fine with me."
4,Very Thankful!!,"This CD is awesome. I was a little apprehensive wondering if we would end up with a CD full of ""A moment like this"" songs or not (not that I'm knocking that song either cause I liked it too). Kelly has an amazing vocal range and an ability to real you into her songs and style. Although the CD does jump around from Pop, to Blues to some R&B sounds, it is very tastefully done and the songs are awesome. I think they could have laid off the instrumental some and let her golden voice shine through more but I've listened to it from beginning to end and was not disappointed.Kelly is a very talented young woman and I'm glad to see her Freshman album be such a success. Shame on the Dallas radio station who said they couldn't stand ""Miss Independent"" because it wasn't ""Kelly's"" style... I've noticed that you are playing the song now - hmmm wonder if that has to do with it's success??!!Way to go Kelly! GREAT CD!!!!!"
3,Not so great.,"I watched American Idol, the first season, with much attention. Needless to say, the girl got talent! Obviously, like someone mentioned in another review, she was judged for her vocal ability and not the songwriting. But I'm sure, she had somewhere along the line, a choice of whether she likes or dislikes a song that was written for her and whether or not she would like to sing it for the CD. I didn't agree with that choice at all! I was very dissapointed and after listening to it for about two, three times I gave the CD to my ten year old daughter; she likes the CD because she likes Kelly. I still like Kelly too and hope that her next album gets better."
3,Not that Impressed,"Kelly is my girl. I loved her on AI, but I'm sorry...I'm just not impressed with this first Album. I only like 2 tracks on the entire CD., which really disappointed me. Who ever wrote these songs didn't do her voice any justice. I'll just have to wait till her next album comes out to hear something better."
4,Great debut,"Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this album. First, I thought it would be filled with sappy songs similar to those on the show. Then, I figured since Clive Davis was working on it, it could not be that bad. I soon found both to be wrong. This album is great. It shows Kelly's diversity and range as a singer. She can carry the ballads (""A Moment Like This"", ""Anytime"") as well as the pop-oriented tracks (""Miss Independent"", ""Beautiful Disaster""). The songs most likely to impress, though, are the bluesy, R&B type tracks (""Thankful"", ""What's Up Lonely""). I believe if Kelly is to focus on one facet of music in the future, that type of music would fit her very well. To those fans of Tamyra Gray, be prepared to enjoy ""You Thought Wrong""; it is an awesome collaboration."
5,Amazing,"This girl has an AWESOME voice, and thiscd just proves it...I love it...this is the one cd I can sit throughand LOVE every song!!~Jenn~"
4,Just what I expected from Kelly Clarkson!,"Kelly's First CD ! ! ! We've waited a long time for this and it's well worth the wait!!The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is that I wish that they would have put a couple more upbeat/dance type songs on her CD. But im sure that Kelly will have more of a say so on her next CD."
5,Excellant,She has done it. A great CD. Some of the songs are harder than people will expect. Just a good thing.
1,Talentless Kelly,"This hurts my ears and so does her new ""Breakaway"" album. She's talentless and not even pretty. She needs to give up singing and do another job. Give the TRUE singers a turn, Kelly!"
2,"Kelly Clarkson, does not Deliver an Award Winning Experience","Personally, I feel that Kelly Clarkson has let the World down with her new CD. I always have enjoyed Kelly because of her ""Girl-Next-Door"" image, and then she did this. Everytime I see her now, she is scantily clad. She can show the world that even though you aren't a size 0, you can still dress nice, NOT sleezy! I was expecting a great CD full of hits like ""A Moment Like This"" But she came out just like Christina Auguleira, all sleezy and gross. She TOTALLY defeated my personal saying of ""Modest are the Hottest"". So now, she is not an American Idol, she is an American Letdown!"
4,excellent start,ok-to the person who related her to pink floyd and led zepplin-HELLO-they are classic rock groups-how can you judge her against them? for a person winning a tv show-sorry-i thought her first cd was pretty damn good-its nice listening to a cd with someone who has a good voice. and the songs-yeah-ok-a couple i would have let out-but show me a cd that every song is perfect-kelly-keep going and growing
1,Another hype not worth the time,"When Kelly debuted on American Idol, I thought, okay, she's got something. Well, that was before they ruined her. Oh gee, let's make her sound like EVERYONE else, Mariah (who can't sing anymore - vocal gymnastics does not equal talent), Whitney, etc.All of the songs on this CD sound the same - BORING. It would do Ms. Clarkson some credit to stay OUT of the studio for a while until she can come up with an original sound."
5,"""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" Kelly Kelly Kelly *ducka ducka ducka*","Kelly Clarkson is an incredibly talented, soulful, young singer who has been compared to Mariah, Whitney, and Celine. The album 'Thankful' has a little something for everyone, soulful r&b ballads like 'The Trouble With Love Is', and 'Some Kind of Miracle, pop ballads, like 'Anytime', 'A Moment Like This', and 'Before Your Love', fun pop songs like, 'Miss Independent', 'Beautiful Disaster', and 'Whats Up Lonely, cool rock songs like 'Just Missed the Train', 'Low', and 'You Thought Wrong' (featuring the freakin' awesome Tamyra Gray),and we can't forget the title track, r&b 'Thankful.' This album is really great, and Kelly's voice is so powerful. For your first listen check out 'Anytime', 'You Thought Wrong', 'Beautiful Disaster' and 'Just Missed the Train!'"
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"""Low"" w/o a doubt is the highlight of this album. Nice rock tinged song. As is ""Just Missed the Train"". The 2 new mixes of ""Before Your Love' and ""A Moment Like This"" are useless. ""You Thought Wrong"" also rocks! Should be huge if Kelly gets her way and this song is released. Not crazy about the r&b songs on this cd. ""Anytime"" sounds like a Jessica Simpson knock-off..and that's not a bad thing. Kelly says her next album will be more of a bluesy/rock affair. Let's hope so."
5,Thankful for Kelly,"Kelly Clarkson took the first American Idol crown, and shows her worthiness of it on her first CD. Combining, Rock, Pop, R & B, Ballads, Jazzy-Blues, and Gospel, Kelly becomes worth her weight in platinum. At first listen, it sounds like a factory put out the songs, but after you get used to her voice, it beings to blow you away on songs like ""Miss Independent"", ""Beautiful Disaster"", and ""Anytime."" ""You Thought Wrong"" (duet with Tamyra Gray), a track which brings to mind ""The Boy is Mine"" from Brandy and Monica, takes the other approach in which the girls team-up against their player, puts the album over the top. Kelly reassured her 5 star rating by NOT singing with Justin Guarini."
4,Great premier album!,"I wasn't sure if I would like her album. But once I got to listening to it, it really is quite good. I have been listening to it everyday since I got it a week ago. It is better than expected! Great job Kelly!!"
4,Thankful for Raw and Natural Talent,"I was very impressed with this CD. I bought it knowing that there were at least 3 songs that I already knew and liked, but I was pleasantly pleased with the CD as a whole. Kelly is one of the few singers out there today that sounds great LIVE (have you heard Madonna live lately?) and I think that critics don't give Kelly enough credit for the natural talent that she possesses, as well as her ability to be pop, rock, R-n-B, and Diva all in one package. This CD showcases all of her abilities in some very original songs and sounds. Move over Celine!!"
4,Every song is good,"That is the first thing I noticed after listening to the CD for the first time. There is something for everyone, you want R&B you've got What's Up Lonely and Thankful, you want ballads you got Some Kind of Miracle, Anytime and The Trouble with Love Is, you want Rock you got Low, Miss Independant, and You Thought Wrong, you want softer rock or pop you've got Just Missed the Train and Beautiful Disaster...and every single song is good, whether you want to sing along or just listen to good music and a powerfully soulful voice, this is an excellent CD. Could use some polishing here and there, but who couldn't?:)"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I thought I was gonna fall asleep. I really love her new hit Miss Independent....very full of life and danceable, but it seems to be the only song on the CD that will probably make it. I'm no critic, just thought I'd let you know if you expect a CD based on the first hit. I expected the whole CD to be like this, or at least a majority. But it was way too mellow for my taste. It sounded just like a Christina Aguilera CD (I wasn't surprised to find out she helped write some of the songs) that I thought it was hers. I think they could have done much better with Kelly's talent instead of just made her another Christina. Very disappointed and have given it a few spins only to find out it simply will not grow on me."
2,nothing special,"After listening to this CD I asked myself was it worth the price that I paid for it and I have to be honest ""no"".It should have been titled ""Nothing Special"". Cut after cut I kept waiting for at least one song on the CD that didn't sound as if it had already been done before but it just wasn't there. My advice is save your money or buy my copy."
4,A pretty strong debut...,"Yeah, I know some people criticize that she's this 'product' but you can't deny that voice.All in all this album is fairly strong but in songwrighting and style choices. I relly enjoy 'Anytime', 'Miss Independent', 'Thankful', and her duet with Tamyra Gray. The other songs are fine but none truly memorable to warrant an instant repeat playing. I'm sure I'll come to enjoy the rest of the album in time...I'll still be a Kelly supporter (which I was since the first day the show aired) and will continue to be a total slave to the American Idol Machine.Oh also...the new 'mixes' at the end of her first two singles aren't truly new versions. From what I can tell, they had her rerecord the ending of Before Your Love and rerecord some of the beltier parts on A Moment Like This. The new versions basically reflect her live performances on the show more so than any studio recording has."
4,Not bad,"It's a pretty good for her debut cd. Of course, it has some slow songs, esp.""The trouble with Love Is"" and ""Thankful"". They're very plain, and have notthing speacial going on about them. Also, the rest of the eight songs (#2-#8) are good. It comes with her two singles she released after she won on American Idol, which are considered ""bonus tracks"". Overall, i would rate it 4&1/2 stars, because there is still something about this cd that makes me enjoy the album, along with her eloquent voice!"
1,"Look What You've Done, Shame On You","This CD just goes to show the further dumbafication of America. The fact that some talentless nobody can stand in front of billions of people and shell out some dribble that some puppeteer behind the scenes throws together is beyond me. All Kelly Clarkson fans should be ashamed of themselves. Everyone should go and find something they enjoy and not just accept whatever some record executive decides to shovel out to you that particular month. C'mon wake up people, this music is garbage."
1,Sick of R&B and Rap,I was expecting more in line of A Moment Like This - it was all R&B and Rap.Save your moneyDon't buy it.
1,honest,only song i like on here is miss independant. Everytime I hear a moment like this I think of that dumb commercial.
1,Overrated,"Kelly Clarkson is overrated. Sure, she has a nice singing voice, but so do a lot of people. Listen to this CD and you'll see that her voice really isn't that special.Not only that, but these songs are so boring! They are just overproduced pop songs. They sound like something Britney Spears would sing, but Kelly's not interesting enough to be the next Britney."
2,What's to be 'Thankful' for?,"Note to Ms. Clarkson: Taking the faux-R&B route will not make you credible, it will merely make you boring. As a fan of manufactered pop, I had high hopes that Kelly Clarkson's debut album would feature cheesy ballads, one or two upbeat poppy numbers, and at least one ill-advised cover track. No such luck. Instead Kelly and her handlers have delivered a retro-marinated R&B snoozer. 'Miss Independent' is cute, but it's lacking something. 'Low' has a catchy chorus and will sound okay on the radio. 'You Thought Wrong' (which features Tamyra Gray) should have been a guilty pleasure tell off song, but it's more gutless than guilty. The rest of the album tracks mesh together in their attempted 'soulfulness'. An artist like Kelly Clarkson (who has a great voice and infectious personality) should be trying to win our affection not our respect. This album and Kelly's chosen career path are a bitter disappointment."
5,Excellent,"Well when Simon said this album would blow people away he was right! The songs, lyrics, beats, notes are all amazing. Now I was expecting a POPPY album but this is totally different! A lot of rock and r&b flares very nice her voice goes very well with the selection of songs! There are very few albums where you don't have to skip songs, but this one you can enjoy the whole cd!"
5,As good as I thought it would be!,"I have been looking forward to Kelly's CD for a long time, and it was worth the wait! I love it! I love her style of singing and I already have 5 different songs I like to listen to over and over. One is the duet with Tamyra Gray, You Thought Wrong, another is Beautiful Disaster. I also like Miss Independent but not as much as the ones already mentioned. LOW is also good, and the other one I like is Anytime.What else can I say? This is a great CD and I very highly recommend it!"
1,"""Thankful"" I did not buy this CD","She may be the winner of American Idol, but this album is mostly slow songs! I heard snippets of it in a CD store one day and thought that all the songs sounded the same. As for ""A Moment like This"" how many more releases will they put this on? Most of these songs are too slow to keep me interested for long...To think that this girl outsold the Beatles... I would have liked to have seen more uptempo songs on this CD... The thing that is missing from this is a little bit of everything else...We will see how she will fair when Justin has his chance to shine.. From what I have heard he has a strong chance to make a showing... Sorry Kelly, maybe next time...."
3,Not Original...,"Now, I was never a HUGE fan of Kelly Clarkson. I though she was kinda annoying on American Idol. But she did have a great voice, so I thought her songs would be good. Plus, I liked the songs ""Anytime"" and ""Miss Independent."" Well, this CD isn't bad, but its definently not blown away good. There is no orginality, and sounds like and Christina Aguilera record. If you dont wanna change of pace, get this. But dont expect alot. Note to Kelly: Leave the pop world to the experts, like Britney."
2,sad,"I was expecting so much more. Some of the tracks are great, but most are boring and lacking. She has talent, but it is not obvious on this cd."
1,Not good!,"Is this music screaming or singing? I am very unimpressed by her debut album. She has a fantastic voice and doesn't need to scream her lyrics. I would suggest she try to do less ""hip hop"" type music and more ballads. They better suit her voice. Overall, this is not a good debut. Sorry Kelly, you lost a fan."
1,THANKFULLY the playing time for this CD is short !,"I was truly looking forward to hearing the results of the delayed KELLY CLARKSON debut CD. I must admit that I am very dissapointed with the end results. Ms.Clarkson's vocals are good however the overall production of this CD lacks direction. The songs selected are "" GRADE B Pop "" as they badly attempt to imitate hits from a multitude of artists currently listed on the BMG roster. Ms.Clarkson's CD is nothing more than a bad melting pot of grade B pop songs. Clarkson should carefully package the next CD if she does not want to end up fizzeling faster than MENUDO did on the North American charts !"
5,"Im ""Thankful"" for this CD.","Finally, were getting back to recognizing talent. Kelly Clarksons golden, powerful voice is showcased in every sonh on this album. All 10 tracks are potential hits, and all have a bluesy, jazz feel to then. This is the best album I've bought in ages."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this CD. It was nothing like the songs she sang on American Idol. Her music is very hard compared to the music she portrayed on AI. The CD forces you to install software you dont want onto your computer (If you play it on your computer), just so you can watch the Video. You are force fed pop up's from the software imbedded in the CD. I bought this CD and sold it on eBay the next day, because I was so turned off by her ""new style""."
2,Average Album,"I`ve been listening to Kurt Nilsen`s (WORLD IDOL FROM NORWAY)album ""I"" for sometime now (which I bought from amazon.canada since it is not available yet in USA)and was pleasantly surprized by this young man`s incredible talent.It not only showcase Kurt`s beautiful and captivating voice but his unbelievable song writing ability(he wrote 9 of the 12 music in the album). So I thought, I`d give our American idol a fair shake and started listening to Kelly and Clay`s album.Oh boy!It was painful.Typical manufactured pop music.No originality nor quality that I look from a musician.I didn`t feel the poetry and the substance from the music when they sing.In short, theirs is very ordinary whereas Kurt`s album is exceptional and astonishing."
5,Awesome album,I bought the album the day it was released and have been listening nonstop since then :-) I love Kelly and loved the album.
4,Stunning Debut,Kelly Clarkson's THANKFUL surprised me. I knew it would be good but this is smashing. COOL BEANS! She shows many styles from ballads and soul to rock and hip-hop. Miss Independent had me dancin' all over the room. Some Kind Of Miracle is inspirational and moving. Low & Just Missed The Train are very powerful songs. Her voice can do just about anything. I will be playing this cd all summer. My only complaint is the cd booklet. no lyrics or timings. and not enough pictures. other than that its stunning!!
3,"Good, not great","Thankful is OK - nothing special though. I much prefer Breakaway. IMO, Breakaway is more of a pop-rock CD. Thankful is much more AC-pop-R&B - a bit bland for my tastes. Kelly's vocals' are awesome, but the songs are not that good (notable exceptions are Beautiful Disaster & Miss Independent.)"
4,"""I'm longing for love and the logical...""","Kelly Clarkson's debut album, Thankful is an awesome mix of music styles, there's pop, country, r&b, and even some rock. Thankful is not as popular or that brilliant as her second album, Breakaway but this disc shows Kelly's potential as a singer and songwriter. Standout tracks include: Beautiful Disaster, Anytime, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, The Trouble with Love Is, and her American Idol hits, A Moment like this and Before your Love. Her voice really shines on Anytime, she was born to do ballads. She really surprised me on Beautiful Disaster and Low, you can feel and hear the anguish in her voice. She's got some chops! She's the best singer to win American Idol. Great and solid debut from a lovely and talented artist."
5,Kelly Clarkson,Kelly's vocals are power-filled. Her range and style is awesome on this album. She sings each song with such ease. Kelly sounds beautiful on soft whispers and spectacular when she belts it out. Kelly is a pure natural!
2,Very Bland,"This album was bland both vocally and musically. All the music sounded pretty much the same, her voice didn't shine through like when she was on American Idol, and there was no emotion there at all. I thought I would love this album but was disappointed. ""Low"" and ""Miss Independent"" were the only 2 songs that stood out."
3,She is capable of SOOOO much more.,"As Kelly Clarkson proved over and over again during the first American Idol contest, she posseses a rare and extremely versatile voice. However, this debut CD does not showcase that stunning talent of hers. The majority of the songs are generic and average. The only ones that give a true taste of her versatility are Miss Independent, Thankful and You Thought Wrong (with Tamyra Gray). The production of the album is top notch, but the individuality/orginality of the song selections needs more work. When I saw Kelly's performance of Miss Independent on American Idol I thought that her CD would be a fresh change from the rest of the songs being played on the radio that sound so much alike that they all just blend together. I was really looking forward to this CD, but I wish I had listened to some more cuts before I purchased it. Kelly, I'm still a big fan of yours and I just know that your 2nd CD will blow us all away! You've got it in you girl ..... now just show us."
1,I'm not thankful,"I am not thankful for Kelly Clarkson, or her booooooooooooooooooooring debut album.First off, the songs are all leftovers of stuff we've heard before(she has an avril lavigne/michelle branch song here, a christina aguilera wannabe song there(their own music is bad enough to begin with), a mariah ballad somewhere in there, and some junk that doesn't go ANYWHERE.This album doesn't go anywhere.It's overproduced, and so painfully cliched and unoriginal.Her voice is average-I've heard many girls sing like this, nothing to go nuts about, nothing very distintive, nothing her own.I say, in a year or less,Kelly Clarkson will wipe off the land of fame, and be thankful for something else, somewhere else,but nowhere we can hear."
2,She's ok,"I loved Kelly on AI1 but I am just now impressed with her now for some reason. She sang great on the AI Christmas Special. The reason she was so good was because she had such volume. She just yells too much. If you like yelling and volume then you will like her. But as far as just singing, she is just ok. She is trying too hard to be cool, like with the nose piercing. That was just a bit much. I just wish that she had just stayed herself. After being so impressed with Clay, I guess I just lost interest in her. He does not have to strain at all. He is a natural and will not change who he is."
1,what is the industry coming to???,"I remember when the music industry had real stars selling records instead of Star Search contest winners who scream instead of sing. If you are looking for new music to listen to by legitimate pop/rock artists, try the new releases by Fleetwood Mac, Madonna, and Annie Lennox. These are real musicians with impressive track records, and they didn't need to win a stupid contest to get a recording contract."
1,Not that good.,"Kelly Clarkson is a rip off!!! Sorry, we only have one Xtina, and you will never replace her!!!"
3,It was just okay...,"Some of the songs on this album aren't easy to listen to. I believe she is talented but the songs they gave her to sing for this CD is not what I expected, but I'll give it 3 stars."
3,Average Debut,"The debut from American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson meets expectations. Her vocals are slightly average, but with amazing production they sound top notch. The songs themselves very from Alt Pop, to blues, to pop, soft hip-hop, to typical ballads. Nothing that will set her apart from other current pop acts, except for her AI crown. Overall, if you like this type of music go for it. i know it will be playing in my stereo frequently."
1,Grossly overrated!,Simon Cowell misled American people. This girl doesn't know how to sing. There is a difference between singing and shouting. Kelly likes to shout rather than sing. Sometimes I cover my ears while she's singing. It's painful to listen to.
3,aww.,i was sooo disappointed.this girl can sing!!!!we all know that.a moment like this.[and end album]
1,"You know how some cs's only have one or two good songs, well","You know how some cs's only have one or two good songs, well this one has NONE, every song really sucks...okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well when I thought things couldn't get worst. Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world's dumdest fake brunette. I've never liked Kelly Clarkson(then, why am I reviewing this)and the only reason my brain has suffered from this no talent bad singer/reality tv star is because of my 10 years old sister.Kelly Clarkson in my opinion is like the ulimate snob. when she was on American Idle she sent the message that you only should like guys that have looks but no brains and that your life is going to be misareble if you are yourself. She says she has always wanted to be a singer but she never said that until she went on the show."
2,Could be better.,"This cd is ok.NOT Grammy worthy.Theres nothing special aboutKelly Clarkson.She sounds to much like Mariah and Christina.Nooriginality in her voice.She needs to develop her own style instead of copying other artists.She is NO MADONNA.KELLY,you needto stop copying other artists."
3,NOT BAD FOR HER FIRST TIME,"I THINK THAT THE CD COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER CONSIDERING WHO PRODUCED THE CD,BUT IT'S NOT BAD.THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD IS TRACK 8 (YOU THOUGHT WRONG(FEATURING TAMYRA GRAY)IF AND WHEN THEY RELEASE THAT SONG AS A SINGLE IT WILL BE NUMBER#1 ON THE BILL-BOARD'S TOP 100 LIST.I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO KELLY'S SECOND CD BECAUSE THIS ONE REALLY ISN'T THAT GOOD BUT IT'S OK.I THINK SHE IS GOING TO BE ONE OF MUSIC'S LEADING LADIES.I WILL SUPPORT HER UNTIL SHE LEAVES THE MUSIC BUISNESS.ALL AND ALL,IT IS A JOY TO HEAR KELLY SING ANYTHING.GO!!! KELLY!!!"
1,Bad,This album is just plain bad. The songs are medicore pop oversung by Miss Enflated Ego herself. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
4,A vocal talent that challenges some of the best,"Awaiting this album, I was expecting a mild album being as American Idol seemed so cookie cutter. However, Kelly Clarkson has proven she has the vocal talents to be compared to some of the best in the industry. Although her first single does not really seem to suit her, the rest of the album shows her vocal versatility. Many will like her upbeat ""Just Missed The Train"". The duet with Tamyra Gray is a great hit with an edge to it (You Thought Wrong). Beautiful Disaster sounds as if it could be a cross over hit for this truly talented singer. She has a breathly wholesomeness to her voice on some of the tracks, while other seem to showcase the true power of her voice. Nice way to come out of the gates, looking forward to many more to come."
1,Horrible just horrible,"Clay Aiken is definitely more talented. Move over Kelly, Clay has taken over."
1,Listen Closely....,"If You Listen To One Of The Songs In The Begining It Sounds Like Avril Lavigne Losing Grip.She's The Bait Of The Radio Mainstream,Reeling In Blinded Fans Of American Idol By Being ""In"",And I Personally Didn't Think Any Of The Songs Have A ""Rockish Feel To Them"" I'd Like To Call That Country.But Hey If You Must..."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS,"This CD is pretty much what I expected from, a person just pulled off the street and allowed to make a cd.The joke of the music industry proves why American idol is a joke. It also proves you don't need talent to sell CD's just a really bad TV show. Kelly enjoy you 2 min. of fame it will be over soon."
1,She sounds like a sheep bleating,"Oh my, what can I say that is nice... Kelly is not as fantastic as people pumped her up to be, she tries to hit notes like Mariah Carey, but when she does it sounds like screeching or screaming and is idstasteful, she did it with the song respect on American Idol too and i was not impressed.I dunno it is obvious that Tamyra Gray was cheated from what should have rightfully been hers. Kelly's voice is not at all fit for singing she should get into Rock where people can shout and scream notes and the fans love it but for me this CD was a waste of time...Sorry I dunno if it was a racial thing where people voted for Kelly because she is caucasian or what but Kelly sure did not win based on talent and it is sad. I think people need to move away from the idea that african americans are not talented because they are Tamyra is definently one of them.I am proud of both ladies for singing their best but Tamyra comes out on top everytime..."
1,One good song,"One good song: The trouble with love. And I already had it on the Love Actually soundtrack. Kind of a waste. I should have listened to the puking sounds my son makes every time Kelly Clarkson is mentioned. But that one good song is so good I hoped she had some others. Good voice, lots of talent. Rotten material. Aretha Franklin didn't get where she is by choosing bad songs. I guess that's the difference."
3,Just okay,"There were only 2 songs on this album that I really like listening to. The other songs are soulful, but it sounds like she's trying to sound like the newer Mariah Carey. Too much bouncing and scaling between notes. Kelly Clarkson has a strong voice, but I think the songs chosen for the album (excluding Miss Independant and A Moment like This) don't fit her style. Almost like she was trying too hard to break into the R&B songs. I wouldn't have paid the $15 I did to buy this CD if I had known I would only like 2 songs. ""Breakaway"" is much better."
3,SLOW FOR MY TASTE!,"This album includes great tracks surrounded by fillers!, the best track on the album of course are the singles (""Miss..."", ""Low"", ""A Moment..."", ""Before Your Love"") some other tracks stand out like ""Beautiful Disaster"", but for my taste the album just goes tooo slow, if you think you will find more tracks like Miss Independet you thought WRONG!."
3,Enjoy the first half,"The first half of this album is just great solid pop music. She sings beautifully and hits those impossible notes (you try singing along and see what I mean). The last three songs are terrible, though. Turn it off after listening to ""Thankful,"" which is a real fun piece of pop and you've got a nice little listening experience."
5,Kelly is spectacular,Kelly Clarkson continues to surprise us with her contant ability to sing different types of songs. I enjoy her album so much!
2,Breakaway is a lot better,"This album is almost completely different than Kelly's second C.D., for she seems to use a soulful style of singing on Thankful that she pretty much has abandoned on her followup album. There are (regrettably) few high-volume energetic tunes like ""Since U Been Gone"" on this album, with most of the songs being soft and relatively too simple. One of the exceptions is the hit ""Miss Independent"", the best track in my opinion. This tune has a unique background beat, soulful lyrics, and a loud, majestic chorus. It would seem that this debut album features a completely different side of Kelly than is on Breakaway, preferably the less desirable side. I wouldn't recommend this album also because it's not satisfyingly intricate, and has few likeable tracks.I recommend:Miss IndependentLowBeautiful DisasterYou Thought Wrong"
3,Better at Pop/Rock than R&B,"The better cuts on this CD are the POP songs. Over sings R&B trying to find the sound that does not exist for her. Stick to POP/ROCK and I might buy the next CD. Kelly does not have a soulful voice. Also, very painfull to watch live."
2,Everything you read is true....,"Kelly Clarkson is an absolute powerhouse as a vocalist, but she needs to stop hiding behind her production team and step out center stage where she belongs!This CD is pure pop fluff and promises to be so much more than it ends up being. I expect great great things from Ms. Clarkson if she takes some risks on her next project. A very safe endeavor, indeed for an artist who, if she starts running her own show will shine like the American Idol that she could be!"
2,"Beautiful voice, boring songs","This album is a shame, namely because Kelly CAN sing. She has great range and a really nice tone, but that does little good when your songs are boring cliches, tired R&B retreads. There isn't a memorable melody in the bunch, and that's a crime. How many times can you sing about love using the same trite language and metaphors? This is a plague that isn't just limited to Kelly Clarkson; most modern female R&B is stuck in a creative rut, repetitively seeing how many different modulations you can sing ""Oh baby"" in."
2,Amercian Idol,"OK I enjoyed the first season of ""American Idol"" and was thrilled to see Kelly win....but now the 15 minutes of fame has gone to her head. All the songs on this third rate album sound too much like a second rate Madonna,Christina,Whitney,Celine wannabe! And why is Kelly turning into a badly dressed, over-pierced drag queen! What happen to the great songwriters and talented producers that were promised! I hope the winner of Season 2 has a better first outing then Kelly! Maybe the second album will be better....."
1,THIS CD IS ALL HYPE,This cd its all the marketing.They hyped it up.Kelly is a goodsinger.But there is nothing SPECIAL about her voice.She is noBARBRA STREISAND OR LINDA EDER.SHE JUST SCREAMS THE SONGS.Thescream scares my cat.COME ON KELLY.YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!do not buy this cd
3,"Good, but most tracks sound alike!","Kelly Clarkson has great vocals! However, I feel like she was jipped...the first two tracks on this album sounded great, but as the tracks went on and on, many sounded alike and a bit boring. I mean, this album isn't the worst, but I was expecting a lot more from her. However, the duet she did with Tamyra was really great! However, I would only recommend this album to hardcore Kelly fans."
5,Great mix of different types of songs!!,"Kelly's voice is amazing and the songs complement each other perfectly! Anytime is a great song that shows her great voice, but there are also fun songs like Miss Independent and her collaboration song with Tamyra! GO KELLY!!"
4,Thoughts on Thankful...,"I believe this CD is very good in many ways, and bad in others. One thing I did like about the CD is that it showed Kelly's whole vocal range. However, I did not like how some of the songs sounded alike. This CD is very much a blues CD, with the exception of Miss Independent and You Thought Wrong featuring Tamyra Gray. There are also some alternative songs, such as Beautiful Disaster. And of course, with every young girl singer, there are going to be some pop songs. However, these songs are slow, and I love them!"
1,Not what I wanted to hear!,"I enjoyed listening to Kelly Clarkson sing when she was on American Idol, and still feel that she has an excellent voice. She sold out on this album. The songs that were chosen for this album were all chosen to appeal to the young age group, who will spend a lot of money on buying her album. I think she sold out! Her voice is too powerful to do songs that do not showcase it. I would have preferred to hear her do more ballads, like ""Anytime"". I do not feel this album is ""her"" style, and I feel that the record label wanted her to do music that would appeal to the buying public. I was let down by this album. All of the songs sound the same, and have that rough beat to them. If you are over 30, you probably will not enjoy this album."
3,I'm Thankful for the blessings and the lessons....,"Kelly Clarkson winner of AI One is truly an amazing tallent. Vocally, this CD is pleasing, and the songs, while some sound generic and alike, are very good.1. Trouble With Love Is 3.5/5 Not my favorite track, but good anyway2. Miss Independent 4.5/5 A fun, fresh and cool track :-)3. Low 4.5/5 One of my favorites!4. Some Kind of Miracle 3.5/5 Reminds me of Trouble With Love5. What's Up Lonely 3.5/5 Good, but is really a filler song6. Just Missed the Train 4/5 Excellent vocals!7. Beautiful Disaster 4/5 Really good!8. You Thought Wrong 4.5/5 A great track!9. Thankful Listen Listen 1/5 Really dull and boring vocals10. Anytime 5/5 Undoubtedly the best track! Kelly's voice is amazing!11. Moment Like This 3/5 Kelly won AI, but this song isn't really ""A Winner"" on THANKFUL12. Before Your Love 4.5/5 Great ending to a good debut!OTHER RECCOMENDATIONS: If you like Thankful you will also love her new album Breakaway, and Diana DeGarmo's Blue Skies!"
4,Kelly Kelly Kelly...,I swear this girl gives me chills everytime she sings or hits them high notes.Im in love with her singing voice.I think her cd is good for a beginner.Keep up the good work Kelly.1.The Trouble With Love Is- 8/102.Miss Independent- 8/103.Low- 9/104.Some Kind Of Miracle- 10/10(Best song on the album!)5.Whats Up Lonely- 6/106.Just Missed The Train- 5/107.Beautiful Disaster- 5/108.You Thought Wrong- 10/10(2nd best)9.ThankFul- 6/1010.Anytime- 8/1011.A Moment Like This -7/1012.Before Your Love- 10/10(3rd best)
2,"lots of potential, but...","There's no denying Kelly has great vocal chops. Unfortunately, no matter how well she sings, there's only so much she can do with material as weak and generic as this. These songs could have been given to any flavor-of-the-week pop singer. Kelly has a unique, Southern-soul voice that recalls great singers from the past like Aretha Franklin and Dusty Springfield. Given the right material, she could make an album that stands up to those artists' classics. This isn't that album. It may sell a ton of CDs, but unless she records songs that will stand the test of time, she's going to be just another quickie pop star. She deserves better."
2,"Not ""Thankful"" for this album","I was very excited to hear Kelly Clarkson's debut album, ""Thankful."" I was VERY disappointed! I have read many of the other reviews on this album, and I am starting to wonder if I have the same album as everyone else. How can anyone say that this album is great? She ruins every song on this album (except ""Miss Independent""--which is the only reason I gave this album two stars)by desperately struggling to hit every note on the scale. KELLY, we already knew you could sing from American Idol, so why do you feel the need to oversing all of the songs?? There's only one person that can do that and get away with it and that's Mariah Carey. So don't try to be something you can't be. Anyways, I thought she was an awesome singer on American Idol, but this album is NOTHING like that. Don't waste your money on it! You'll be ""thankful"" if you don't!"
5,The Best of Kelly Clarkson!!,Even though this is Kelly's first cd I think it's the best thing she's done so far.I have liked her ever since American Idol and never stopped. This cd is very down to earth and I can relate to it which makes me want to listen to it more. The lyrics are very catchy and I can't wait to learn all the songs. I've only had the cd for a day and love it all ready. YOU GO KELLY!!!!
2,We waited this long for this???,"Okay, I will admit to being a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson. Finally there is a star who can actually sing live! American Idol was a great stepping stone for her, but I've been waiting for months now to hear what direction the record company would take her, and YUCK! The album is not what I expected in the least.... it's a mix of Christina Aguilera discards..... Kelly has such an amazing vocal range that she seems stifled on this album... Hopefully there will be enough support for a second album..... and maybe the soundtrack to the movie will throw out some good singles.... who knows....I wish the best to Kelly and I hope she does well, but she needs to get control of her beginning career and give American and the world something that the other youngsters can't bring to the table... Kelly has Raw Talent!!! Unleash it and hopefully remix some of the songs and then we will see her shine!!!"
5,'Thankful' for Kelly Clarkson.,"This album is definately my favorite from all the AI contestants that were fortunate enough to make an album. Every track on here is different and worth a listen. Or two, or three..and more..Kelly's voice is beautiful. I would definately recommend this album, especially if this is your type of music."
5,Kelly can anyone can!,"Kelly started as a talented young waitress in TEXAS. Now look at her. Clarkson's CD shows strength and integrity. As her voice belts out, you can tell that under all of those tunes, there is an innocent andk kind person. Kelly Clarkson is unstoppable and her voice is magnificent. She makes me want to get up and jump for joy and she graces the stage or rocks the radio. I am a proud owner of Thankful ~KELLY CLARKSON~ and personally, I think everyone should get this CD. It makes you feel good about yourself and about the lady who had nothing and who now has everything."
4,A Great Surprise,"Although I never followed American Idol, I heard stories about it on the news. As soon as I head the song Miss Independent I went and bought the cd. What a pleasant surprise. This cd is great. Although some songs should have been left out, there are other great ones. These are: The Trouble with Love is, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, Beautiful Disaster and Anytime (this one being my favorite). Buy this cd if you love pop music. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Great debut!!,"Kelly should be thankful for this album, its one of the greatest. It prooves American Idol isn't just 15 muinutes of fame. The best song on this cd is ""The Truble With Love is"", its just the perfect song."
3,"good, but not what i expected","i absolutely adore kelly clarkson, and think she has an amazing talent.. and i think knowing that is the only thing that kept me from becoming TOTALLY disappointed in this cd.. PLEASE don't get me wrong, i DO love her.. it's just i don't think this cd showcases her talent as much as it could.. some of her performances on the show were so powerful and i had such high hopes for the cd.. and it's just not. it's good, but she could have shown so much more! and i think she needs to find her genre.. she's a country girl, and i feel like the album tried too hard to be R&B-ish.. more power to her if she wants to try other things, but it just almost didn't ""feel"" right to me. however, i'm looking forward to the next album and kelly will always be my girl!"
3,Thankful- Not quite what I expected,"To say that we have been eagerly awaiting this CD would be correct. And after hearing two snipets ""Anytime"" and ""Miss Independent"" on American Idol my expectation was even greater. After getting the CD I would have to say it is a bit disappointing. The album has more of a rock/pop feel which, at some points, sound as though she should be fronting a band rather than as a solo artist. Some high points include the hard hitting ""You Thought Wrong"" a duet with Tamyra Gray and the title track ""Thankful"" along with ""Miss Independent"". Though I'm sure the album will be succesful, tread carefully. If you thought you would get something like Christina Aguilera, Janet Jackson or Spears this is not really it. I would best describe this as more rocky, a small part R&B/pop and a few spots with both mixed togeter. I hope this helps. You may want to hear more tracks before diving in to make a purchase. I wish I would have."
2,Very Disappointing,"Kelly is a great singer. I love her voice. But I only like 2 songs on this disc and those 2 songs were on the ""American Idol"" cd. I really didn't like the rest of the cd. I'm hoping her next cd will have better songs. When she was on American Idol I really liked it best when she was singing older songs. I think a cd of remakes by Kelly would be great."
2,Should have been better,"What a disappointment. As a big fan of Kelly Clarkson on the American Idol show, I was excited for her CD to be released. Not only is the music selection ""me too"" for hip hop/soul, but the mixing was totally out of balance. I could hardly hear her great voice over the loud instrumentation. What's the point of having a talent search for someone with talent and originality when she's just going to be forced to be a wannabe Christina Agulera, etc. I still think she's one of the most talented voices out there. She just needs to have a more talented producer."
5,This album has a very,"This album tastes like a squirrel. Shut up binky! I recommend yoooo... you buy it, but don't sit on his oatmeal. The sound SHUT YOUR TRAP BINKY is rather unique in its way it. sit on the noodles.BINKY MUST DIE! lalalallalalla fan of Kelly's work on lalalalalala Binky. So when you are in the.Scratch around the moo... stop mooing Binky. Your so annoying."
2,unfortunate,"I have listened, and re-listened, and re-listened to this album in hopes of seeing a glimpse of the adorable woman who captured our hearts last summer.Sadly, it is not to be.I had hoped to hear something akin to the bluesy songs Kelly chose to perform on the show last year, bringing back raw rootsy american music into the mainstream. Instead, the recycled sound of the worst type of pop filters through my stereo speakers.For those who believe that there is no such thing as ""good"" pop music, I suggest you re-listen to The Beatles ""Abbey Road"", to Ben Harper's ""Burn to Shine"", and to U2's ""Joshua Tree"" all fine examples of the best pop (okay, maybe it's a stretch to call Harper ""pop"" but he did receive quite a bit of radio airplay) has to offer.To those searching for a little bit of soul in pop music, I suggest you forget about Kelly Clarkson's debut, and check back for her next effort. Her voice is beautiful--perhaps next time her producers will actually create something worthy."
5,awsome totally,"i think kelly clarksons an awsome person, she went through so much to get where she is today."
3,Incredible Voice -- Song selection could be better,"Kelly Clarkson's voice has the power of a freight train, yet the sweetness of a songbird...even though her voice is as beautiful as ever, the songs on this CD fail to reflect the vibrant talent that we all saw on American Idol. I anxiously await her next CD..."
2,NOT MY IDOL,"I was looking forward to getting this cd that I popped it in my cd changer for the road. 1 minutes into listening to the the first song I starting to scan through all the tracks.....I ALMOST FEEL ASLEEP. Kelly's voice is so powerful when she was singing other's people's songs but oh the songs on her own cd are soo boring and had no dimensions. All the songs sounds the same, mellow, and outdated. So sad how a cd with such notable names backing it up is so bland and unexciting. Maybe its just me but I am usually open to broad range of music...but somehow I couldn't get into this one. Oh well....I guess I was just so dissapointed I had to write an input."
1,Not one of the better pop cd's out there...,"I would prefer a Hilary, Christina, Mandy, Britney, or a Jesdsica cd any day... Clarkson has no breath control and really can't carry a tune, besides the songs here are not very good in my opinion."
1,Disappointed So Much,"I had expected this to be really great after waiting so long.But as you listen to the tracks they are so generic that you can attribute them immediately to the other singers who's style they represent.Kelly has absolutely no style of her own...just sings what is in front of her. No major complaints about her voice it's quite good except really...no style whatsoever.I wanted to like this cd, I really did.It was a huge disappointment. I would be surprised if she comes out with another one right way. I am hoping Guarini does better, his voice was just as good and he definitely has style of his own. Grey however...sounds oddly tinny on the track on the Clarkson album."
1,BOGUS!,"i have to say that kelly's voice is beautiful, and she's very pretty, but if u listen to her songs on this album, it makes it sound like America chose the wrong person to be idol. i like miss independent and low and anytime, but the rest are like totally bogus. the rest of the songs i didn't list sound almost the same. i couldn't remember which one was what's up lonely, some kind of miracle, and just missed the train because they had the same type of rythym. so if i were you and thinking about buying kelly's album, i'd totally forget it!"
2,Great voice wasted on insipid songs,"A big fan of Kelly's from last season's show and I've been looking forward to her much-delayed cd. That said, there are five songs that I kind of enjoy (Anytime, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, You Thought Wrong). The other five are complete filler. The album as a whole seems to be a lot of fluff that has no particular feeling to it. And the bonus tracks were a complete waste of time. Not sure why they couldn't have included ""Stuff Like that There"" or something that would have been a true bonus. Just too many ballads, too much over-sweet filler. Just very, very bland. They should have put more effort into a cohesive cd instead of wasting her energy on what will likely be one of the worst movies of 2003. Not sure if this is a good sign for future Idol contestants, but I'm hopeful that Kelly will rebound from this and re-remind us why we voted for her in the first place."
2,Overrated,"This CD was a disappointment. Kelly is basically riding the coat tails of a very successful TV show. Her voice is the result of digital remastering on this CD. Although some of the tracks are decent, I was hoping for more. Miss Independent is probably the best song, but after that, you'd be better off just listening to someone with more talent. The second season of American Idol has far better performers."
3,Worth listening to....,"I really like Kelly's voice, she can really sing, but at times on this CD she struggles with a song that is not well written, Track called Low for example. Alot of the songs are upbeat, which is too bad, she sings one hell of a ballad. I think this CD is a great sart for her career and I look forward to her sophomore album. Worth buying, but a few of the songs you may tend to always skip."
3,Kelly Clarkson begins...,"Kelly Clarkson's first album has a bit of this style and a bit of that style. None of it's bad, but not all of it's great like ""Breakaway."" The sound quality, the singing and musicianship on this disc is really good. The highlights include, The Trouble With Love Is, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed The Train and Beautiful Disaster.Kelly Clarkson might just be the best singer since Ian Gillan (of Deep Purple fame), who sang the part of Jesus in 1970's ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" Well done Ms. Clarkson."
5,Every Song Is Good!! A Real Rarity!!,"Not many artists can say they've released a ""perfect"" album, but apparently quite a lot of thought and care went into this one and it shows! Kelly's duet with Tamyra Gray is a standout, as well as songs with backing vocals by Daneille Brisbois (former child star on ""Archie Bunker's Place"")!"
4,Pretty Good...For a Contest Winner,"While Kelly has a good voice, there are only a few songs on this album that are really good. The duet with Tamyra Gray is amazing. If you know someone who's a huge Kelly or American Idol fan, this is a great gift."
5,GREAT CD! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BUY IT,"i have nothing bad to say about this cd. i love every song on it, and it doesnt happen too many times that i like every song on a cd. Its got a lot of diversity on it. fast songs, slow songs,mid tempo songs and all different styles of music. trust me you won't be disappointed."
5,AWESOME!!!,"It sounds awesome. I love the lyrics and the sound of the entire album. Except for the song ""Some Kind of Miracle"" it just isn't my type of song.She ROCKS!!"
4,Thankful for the fresh sounds...,"Kelly could have been swept up by some producers looking to crank out a quick (and quickly forgotten) moment in pop culture. I for one am THANKFUL that didn't happen. The twelve tracks here showcase an honest talent. Kelly's provactive voice is neatly wrapped around some quite listenable tunes. The girl has the pipes to over sing a power ballad like ""A Moment Like This"" or ""Before Your Love"" and I was expecting a disk full of moments like that. Whatever Kelly put on disk was bound to sell and dart to the top of the charts. Thank goodness someone took the time to make a quality album in the process. ""Low"" is a standout for me."
5,HEAVY HITTER,"Kelly Clarksons ""Thankful"" is lush and heavy with hits. This set is rich and textured to please with devotion, power, pout, and doubt. You won't be skipping tracks on this one. This collection of songs on balance is one the best ever for a debut album."
5,IDOL DEBUT IS RICH,Kelly Clarksons first collection is a rich twelve course haute cuisine roller coaster with oohs and ahhs for every palate. The eclectic mix bares much but not all of Miss Clarkson. She deftly controls her massive voice and leaves you with the absolute impression that if she had wanted she could have split your speakers. The driver in this endeavor is the luscious voice America elected as it's best. Everybody deserves a hand for this one.
4,A great start,"Kelly's debut album really shows why she wont the AI title. Unfortunetly, I don't think that show has come up with any other stellar talent since then and should've quit after the first season. The only songs that I really don't care for are A Moment Like this and Before Your Love; although Kelly does an excellent job vocally. They are just too cookie-cutter-like ballads. The rest of the CD is great-full of Kellys powerful vocals and shows off her wonderful range and control. I look forward to many more great albums from this talented young lady."
3,Pretty much what I expected,"Just picked this up yesterday and have listened to it twice through. I love Kelly, and she performed well on all the songs, but the songs themselves I found, overall, to be weakly written and typically popish. Nothing really surprising, though Miss Independent was a little unusual (and probably my fav track).Would love to see her next album include some more original sounding songs... she's a definite talent, just needs the songs to showcase it :)"
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I really love this CD. I think Kelly has an amazing voice and uses it to its potential. I like the fact that she didn't stick to one particular style or genre but has a variety on this CD. There are only 2 songs on this CD that I skip #3-Low (its got a Faith Hill vibe & I'm not really into Country,) and Beautiful Disaster, I just don't really like that song. BUT, my friend & my cousin both got the cd too and they both love both of those songs, so its just a matter of taste. Over all I was very pleasantly surprised and I think she did an awesome job for her 1st time out. She also shares writing credit on I think 3 of the songs which is great, and means she's headed in the right direction if she can last in this business. So I'd day ""BUY IT"" you won't be disappointed."
4,"Awesome voice, uninspiring songs?","I loved that Kelly Clarkson won American Idol, her vocals and personality are phenominal. However, I think this album might have been something that was created too quickly. The songs dont have much power in them. Kelly's voice, I believe, is not utilized to it's best ability on this album. However, I still give it four stars because heck, the girl can sing and the songs do grow on you after you stop paying attention to the lyrics so much. The 10th song is one of my favorites, it ""justify's"" (haha) Kelly's voice the best. Seriously, I think they should have spent a little more time creating songs that fit Kelly a little better. However, I think most people will enjoy the album. It has a little R&B, pop, and romatic-type songs so it will surely please everyone. You go girl!"
2,Not exciting.,"I expected much more from this American Idol winner. Her incredible voice was showcased on the show to millions of viewers, and I thought to myself (If this girl wins, she will be the next Mariah Carey)However, I just think this album was thrown together way to fast. It has an un-inspired feeling when listening it. I think Kelly Clarkston should consider writing some lyrics of her own, and chosing some songs that showcase her vocal range.She has talent, but it is just not being shown in the right ways on her first disc. Of course there are some catchy tunes here ""Miss Independent,"" and ""Low"" are the strongest songs here (coincendentally the first two singles) and the rest sounds like filler. Maybe and hopefully her follow-up will be more inspired, and more thought-out."
2,Disappointed,"I followed the first season of American Idol religiously. I didn't miss an episode. The whole time I loved Kelly. (even though I was cheering for Justin) I had so much respect for Kelly. She made everything her own no matter if she was singing songs from the big band era or a brand new song off Celine Dions new album. She was solid in every type of music from every time period. But I was so so so disappointed in her album. I found myself only listening to ""A moment like this"" and ""Before your love"" songs that I was already tired of. To me it didn't sound like she had her heart and soul in it. Almost as if she was just singing it to get the song recorded and over with. It wasn't the same Kelly I watched and cheered on American Idol."
2,visitor,"I was really expecting a great cd. I heard Miss Independent and was really looking forward to the rest of the cd. If I want that type of quality for a whole cd, then I guess I will have to stick to Christina. It isn't a terrible cd, just not a great one. Her vocals are good, which become great with studio touchups, but the songs are just boring and lacking."
4,Thankful for Kelly's New CD,"I really enjoyed Kelly's new CD. I think she has a great voice and most of the songs on her CD are great. I know I can listen to the whole CD instead of replying one or two songs. I don't know why people are so negative, she deserves to be a star, we did vote for her."
1,fifteen minutes up,this is just more of the same assembly line fluff music with no emotion it has to do with looks rather than substance.i'm so sick of this music for the last ten or so years when will it end?if i could give it a zero rating i would
3,good voice but.....,"i like her voice, thats the whole reason i bought this album in the first place, i saw it and i bought it, but i didn't listen first... i thought a person with that good-of-a-voice can't have a horrible cd... and thuis cd isn't horrible, but it's not great either. It's medium. if i was to rate for the songs i would give it 2stars, but she amazes with the vocals so i give her 3...the songs aren't badly perfomed, but they are very boring. i only like the songs; Trouble With Love Is, Miss indepentant and just missed the train.. Low is okay, but i don't like the way the song is sung.. e.g. the melodie.... the rest are very ordinary songs, nothing special in my ears...inless you are a die-hard fan of Clarckson.. i would advice you tolisten through the cd before you buy, just incase it's not your thing."
4,Thankful by Kelly Clarkson,I enjoyed this CD because I think Kelly Clarkson has a fabulous voice. My only complaint would be that I would like to hear her sing more standards. She shouts sometimes and tries too hard and it sounds forced on a couple of the songs. I didn't notice that on the show. But I enjoy it!
3,"Good potential, not quite there","I have seen Kelly Clarkson so much that I thought I would buy her CD. For the most part, it's evident that she's a newcomer to the music business. Her slurring of words and breathy singing doesn't quite do it for me. I enjoyed the track ""Anytime"" and her duet with Tamyra Gray, but other than that, this CD didn't really do anything for me. I think Clive Davis needs to rethink what American IDOL means."
5,Amazing debut album!,"Kelly Clarkson's ""Thankful"" is simply amazing. A terrific debut album from America's Idol.The best tracks have to be ""Low,"" ""Just Missed the Train,"" ""Miss Independent,"" ""Some Kind of Miracle,"" and ""Anytime.""Here are my ratings in order (out of 5 stars) not including ""A Moment Like This"" or ""Before Your Love""1(tie). ""Low"" - 5""Just Missed the Train"" - 53(tie). ""Some Kind of Miracle"" - 4""Anytime"" - 4""Miss Independent"" - 46. ""Thankful"" - 3.57(tie). ""The Trouble with Love Is"" - 3""Beautiful Disaster"" - 3""You Thought Wrong"" - 3You should definitely pick up the album. It is great! We can be sure to expect BIG things from Kelly."
5,"Kelly Clarkson, Thankful","Kelly Clarkson is a great singer, she totally rocks on ""Miss Independant""and shows her much sought after talent on a variety of other styles of songs. I am very happy with the purchase of this CD. If you've heard any of her songs on the radio or t.v., you will enjoy it too."
3,Thankful for Breakaway,"Kelly's debut album is thoroughly respectable. I'd give it a strong 3 stars, just doesn't quite have a 4-star feel. The album is like lite rock with R & B at times. Kelly's voice is the strong point of it. Notable songs:Miss Independent - biggest radio hit. Has edge and attitude. Kelly sings the chorus line very powerfully.Low - strong and emotional vocalsBeautiful Disaster - poignant, genuine feeling.Just Missed the TrainAnytime - powerful songIf Kelly had released another album like this instead of Breakaway, she might well be fading like some other Idols. A very respectable start, but fortunately just the start. Waiting for more to come. Keep going, Kelly."
4,Kelly Clarkson rocks!,"I must admit that this CD grew on me, folks. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 now (I had a review up earlier that rated it 3 1/2 stars before this one).*The Good*The Trouble With Love IsLowBeautiful DisasterAnytimeA Moment Like ThisSome Kind of MiracleYou Thought WrongMiss IndependentJust Missed The Train*Songs that don't hurt or help*What's Up LonelyBefore Your Love*The Filler*Thankful although I still like itI must say that in ways, I prefer this CD over Breakaway because it's a lot more soulful. I do love Breakaway too--songs like Gone, Since U Been Gone, Addicted, Because of You and Breakaway are awesome. I also like You Found Me which at first I hated."
4,excellent debut,"I read that Kelly initially wanted to name thisdisc, ""Pidgeonhole This"", and it would have beenfitting. Thankful is fresh and ecclectic withoutbeing schitzophrenic. Kelly shows off her massiverange without resorting to vocal gymnastics.Keep up the good work, Kelly."
4,Deluxe,"Masterful, saucy, and silky smooth, like Granny Smith's famous apples, Kelly has woven a pie crust of warmth, and has filled it with scrumptious lyrics, full of plump, juicy, and sugary-sweet appointments. I love eating to this cd, especially when I'm feeling low. I just whip out my favorite gallon of ice cream, turn up the volume, and eat my tears away!The title, ""Thankful"", reminds me of Thanksgiving, when the table is full of my favorite dishes, and this year, instead of the typical Peggy Lee, we'll be blasting the loveliness that is Mrs. Kelly Clarkson.I hereby announce my LOVE for this four-square-meal of a musical choice, right here on Amazon!"
5,The Voice,"Finally a girl who really sings! What a wonderful album, i'm impressed! Kelly Clarkson is a revelation, listen to these songs without prejudices and you will find out a soul/r&b/rock star. My favorite tracks are ""Beautiful Disaster"", ""Just Missed The Train"" & the explosive ""You Thought Wrong"", a duet with Tamyra, another talent from American Idol. If you're looking for something fresh and new go and buy this album, you won't be disappointed."
5,Wonderful!!,"I'm definetly going to have to agree with M.Boon from Georgia - Kelly Clarkson is an amazingly talented person and should be respected for how she sings, not where she developed from, American Idol. This cd is definetly a must have in your music collection, if you love powerful, soulful, voices. Kelly Clarkson's debut album is beautiful and has a good variety of music types. She has pop, soft rock, pop rock, and R&B. Her voice soars and there is absolutely no need to skip a single track on this cd - it's that good. So please, give her a try!! :' )"
4,Thankful,"I think many of us are ""thankful"" for Kelly Clarkson. One reason might be that, because of her Christian beliefs, we know that she won't end up another Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera.Kelly brings great songs, and a level of maturity to the music world. My favorite songs on this CD are ""Miss Independant"", ""Low"", and ""You Thought Wrong"", featuring Tamyra Gray.I would recommend this CD, as well as Clay Aiken's, to everyone.P.S. Please don't comment on my review in your own...thank you."
5,I'm Thankful Too!,"I love Kelly Clarkson, and I love this CD! All of the songs are great, and I can't wait for the next American Idol CD to come out... then I'll have everything that I need until this American Idol is over (that is until From Justin to Kelly comes out). If you like a person with a really good voice, you should get this CD!"
3,More refinement needed,"Ms. Clarkson clearly shows she has a major league voice, but this CD shows that she needs a lot more work on it. Clarkson felt the need to show her range and scream at the top of her lungs at every opportunity. However, sometimes, more variety in the vocal range would showcase her high notes even better. Instead, in this album, all we get is Clarkson continually shouting at every opportunity. A more nuanced approach would showcase her voice even better and make the occasional high note even more special."
1,Diva-in-training needs better material,"A year in the making and dozens of producers and songwriters. The result is entirely mediocre. Granted, there are some standouts that are radio-friendly such as the Christina co-penned ""Miss Independent"" but rest is pretty much lacking in any memorable hooks, the elusive element so many pop divas live and die by. It's quite obvious that all these stellar 5 star reviews are coming from naive teens who have grown up on a steady diet of corporate muzak and can't appreciate how bland and predictable music has become. Her voice is efficient but lacks the nuance and depth of other more seasoned singers. One wonders with material this boring whether she will be given an opportunity to develop after the onslaught of AI finalists all scramble for their bit of pop stardom."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I PREORDERED KELLY'S CD,COULDN'T WAIT,THIS CD IS NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR MONEY,I THREW IT OUT IN THE TRASH, NEVER AGAIN"
1,"Unoriginal, carbon-copy, boring garbage!","Not much to say about this pile of rubbish. It sounds like every other CD that is fit for pre-teen girls. Everything has the feel of super-slick studio production, which gives it a synthetic, fake vibe. American Idol really does a great job at promotion though, almost convincing us that this trash is in actuality a treasure."
1,okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well when I thought things couldn't get worst. Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world's dumdest fake brunette. I've never liked Kelly Clarkson(then, why am I reviewing this)and the only reason my brain has suffered from this no talent bad singer/reality tv star is because of my 10 years old sister. Kelly Clarkson in my opinion is like the ulimate snob. when she was on American Idle she sent the message that you only should like guys that have looks but no brains and that your life is going to be misareble if you are yourself. She says she has always wanted to be a singer but she never said that until she went the show"
1,Boring....,"*yawn* I was never a Kelly fan, and her album justified my reasons for not liking her even more.So what is she? R&B; or wannabe pop? The album will never tell. ""Miss Inpdendent,"" although a catchy song, is just Miss Christina Aguiler's leftovers and doesn't deserve the publicity it's getting.RCA is just trying to turn Clarkson into a generic pop machine, make her into a Britney Spears although this will never happen. There is nothing traditionally sexy about Clarkson and I can't see her making a mark like Spears did. First album was successful, so? She won a contest, got lots of publicity, hence the reason she sold quite a few albums. She'll die off so fast in a couple months people will be saying, ""Kelly who?""Buy Clay's cd instead."
2,i wish it was a moment like that,"When i bought the album, i was really expecting great upbeat overwhelming talent like ""Before your love"" or ""A moment like this"" but unfortunately, this wasn't so. Kelly Clarkson resembles Lucy Woodward or Jennifer Love Hewitt in most of her songs. The only difference: kelly screams on the top of her lungs. I was thinking Pop, but, I guess, American Idol didn't really occur to her as she was writing some of the songs. She can be considered an American Idol trator. I love Kelly, but she really disappointed me with this album."
2,Japanese :-P,"if your thinking about buying this- DONT! i made a huge mistake getting it, and i love kelly. although natural woman is a great track, its not worth $30 when you can download it for free- and the rest of the cd is japanese! at least clay aiken's import was in english (and the bonus was a bit better)since some of the other tracks on thankful arent that great, dont waste 30$ on this, buy something else of kelly's thats priced reasonably, or better yet, buy something of clays!"
1,UGH,"This album is just awful. ""A Moment Like This"" is clearly your everyday, generic, mushy gooshy, crappy love song."
3,good start to a great career,"I have to start by saying that Ms. Clarkson has a great voice, there is no denying that. The tracks are good and it is a very successful debut for the first American Idol. My only concern is that Ms. Clarkson may be trapped in a management company that is only interested is throwing together a CD that emulates other popular artists and selling it on the success of a TV show. In the future I hope Ms. Clarkson has more of a hand in choosong her material and is allowed to really showcase her great talent."
5,A SOULFULL CD,"Kelly's Cd has a wonderful soulfull feel to it. It is not a cheesy Pop cd, anyone who can respect talant would enjoy this cd."
5,I her but Hilary duff and her a tie.Don't you think?,What lovely music.It's so musical and so entertaining.Kelly Clarkson was even a winner in American Idol.I also like hilary.She's a Star!:):):)Melissa
4,Very Excellent!,"It's so nice to hear a female singer that has talent, and doesn't use her body like trash like the Beyonce's and Brittany's around. The Trouble With Love Is and Miss Independent are awesome pop songs and I just love them. You go girl!"
2,I totally disagree with the guy who named his review Great For All Ages!,"Like my title says I totally disagree with the guy who named his review Great For All Ages! Beet is just plain boring.The plot is basicly just like BLEACH. only BLEACH is more exciting and more funny. All that main characters in Beet are doing is just slaying vandels/monsters and it gets so dull. And its not great for all ages. I was bored of it when I was 8 years old and right now Im 11. And if you think Im one of those people that only read the 1 st book, your wrong I read volumes 1-9. The only reason I gave Beet 2 stars is because the drawings looked cool.Over all its a dull and boring sieries.If you want a good manga to read try Naruto, or Mar. If you want a more video game related manga try Gamerz Heaven by Maki Murakami."
5,Much faster than the Sony High Speed Memory stick,"I bought one of the SanDisk 2 GB Ultra II Memory Stick Pro Duo cards, just to compare to the Sony High Speed cards. So I took my 8.1 mp camera out to a near by lake and starting shooting in burst mode. The Sony 2 Gig High Speed Pro Duo started to stutter after about 20 frames which is pretty decent, but when I shot the same subject in the same conditions and it went beyond 100 frames before it began to stutter a little. But it was very quick to recover and start shooting again.This was just a test to see if there was any difference between the two high speed cards, and honestly most people would never rack off over 20 frames at 2.1 frames per second, but with this card you can get what Sony says you can get with this camera and that is 100 frames at 2.1 per second.Just a nice easy test"
4,Excellent service but cost was average,"This product was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. The product is exactly as expected. The price was fair as I found it days later for sale for the same price at the big electronics stores. I was hoping to get a better deal by buying it online. Other than this, I would purchase from this company again."
5,"The nature and analysis of cultural, economic and political developments","The United States and Canada have the world's largest border and trading relationship and so they share a long history of trade relations. Any college-level collection strong in Canada history in general and US-Canada relations in particular thus needs Canada and the United States: Ambivalent Allies, a 4th updated edition extensively rewritten and updated to reflect new scholarly arguments and discoveries on the nature and analysis of cultural, economic and political developments.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Technical Note on This Title,These 10 discs were not made at a factory like a Record Label would put out a CD. They were made on a computer. These discs may or may not play on your home theater CD player or car stereo system. I was only able to get my set of these discs to play on my laptop. My home theater CD player could not read them.
5,"WOW, WOW, WOW!","I have cds from all the sales and pd superstars and listen to them during the six to eight hours I'm in the car each day. I've certainly learned from all of them but, without fail, I would find my mind wandering from time to time and have to go back a track or two and re-listen. NOT with this one! It is basically like sitting in a day long lecture by the original master. It's Dr. Hill, live and in person, speaking directly to you. In my opinion there is nothing better out there to spend your money on. Order it NOW."
1,"Bad design, bad headset.","Purchased my set from Bestbuy. Also bought the protection plan for them. I've currently replaced these headphones 3 times.The first two times the microphone died. I think the headset has a problem with moving the boom mic up and down.Third time the speakers blew at the high range. In order to use the surround sound function of this headseat, you have put a AAA battery in them. This will allow you to activate surround sound with a switch. The power this puts to the headphones is too much for them to handle.For gaming, this isn't the set you should get."
2,Nice CHARM to add to a bracelet,This charm is small and beautiful ... the hook on the charm broke after 1 week ... considering the price I was shocked at the small size and the fact that it broke so quickly ... BUT I will not return this product because I do love it despite the downfalls
4,"Solid, but slow and costly","This replaced my RMA-ed Linksys EZXS88W v3 8-port which overheated and died after 3 days of use.Compared to the Linksys:Good:Nice mounting bracket (can use to hold non-3com items)Smarter (Auto MDI/MDX detection)Brighter, well-spaced diagnostic LEDsMetal/Plastic construction seems much more solid than LinksysLifetime warrantyDoesn't meltBad:Larger footprintonly 60Mbit/s (Linksys did 90MBit/s)costs $20-$30 moreOverall, it's a nice switch, but I wonder why its bandwidth is so low."
1,Timeouts on remote connections,Longtime Amazon customer but this is the first time I have ever been driven to write a review.This product was a huge disappointment after upgrading from my old Netgear RT314.The problem? It times out my remote connections after about 15 minutes.. So I might be SSH'd into a remote system (work) doing some work.. Step away for a few minutes or get distracted and Bam.. Lost connection. And here I thought I had 'always on' internet. The old Netgear would stay logged in for days.I contacted 3COM customer support (a very lengthy endeavor) and they told me it was 'designed to do that'. A quick search will show a lot of people who have this problem.It will be many years before I buy another 3COM product.
2,Disappointing,"Despite the impressive phonological apparatus Morris Halle contributed to this work, the reader needs to look closely at the derivations proposed. In almost every case, the rule applications are no more than diachronic restatements. In other words, they simply recap the historical evolution of the current forms.That is because the concept of underlying forms is the stumbling block of Chomsky's theory, and although Chomskyians and their ilk try to avoid diachronic data, they really cannot in the long run."
2,Long since obsolete,"Tis book kick-started the fields of phonology and linguistics, but it is long since obsolete. It's a work that is based on intuition, and the field has moved on to experimental techniques. Rather, I should say that experimental fields have grown up, like Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics, but linguists in Chomsky's tradition have largely ignored them.It's a work that describes English, but gives the impression that it is providing deep explanations of English. For instance, it popularized the idea of a ""feature"" as a basic, atomic entity in linguistics. But, 50 years on, features have led to many publications but few insights that have proved themselves useful outside the tightly knit community that uses them. Speech technology, for instance, never found features to be particularly useful.It's a Bible among a certain class of linguists, but it's not clear whether it has actually led to much."
1,Way too bias for me,"I bought Motor Trend for 30 years, but for the last few years they have become a follow the leader, praise what's hot, and have little regard for value. If it's foreign they have the hots for it, they will kick an American product with better stats just because it's American. I've wrote letter after letter to the editors and not once was one printed, if you are critical they ignore you. Don't get me wrong they haven't strayed too far from the pack, most all the car mags give props to the large advertisers. If you truly want to know about an automobile go to the dealer and drive it yourself, don't rely on the stiffs at magazines, if you do you will be disappointed. They're like Consumer Reports and Toyota, CR loves their Toyota's even when they are a pile of junk they get praise."
2,Missing Issue,"This is and always been a fantastic read, especially when Angus Mackenzie writes his mini articles; however, I have a lot of missing issuesI guess its to compensate the cost on how cheap its being offered to the public.I'm on Vol 63 (year 2011) missing numbers 1,3,4I got 2 and 5. (As with magazines they organize like this, May 2011 Vol. 63, NO.5)"
4,Slow delivery but good magazine.,Took about 6 weeks for first one to arrive. Costed less than $1 an issue and not a bad magazine. I suggest you check out the different car magazines at the library or something to pick the best one for you.
1,Where's My Magazine?,This was a renewal; not a first time purchase. I have not received any magazines to date. I renewed on 2-12-08.....
4,Great magazine,"Good magazine, but I feel like they're really bias on some cars.Also, they tend to test cars brand new off the market and don't really testthe durability and survivability of cars."
3,I still love the magazine,"I love MotorTrend because its articles just seem better to me. I like how they set up that I can understand what makes each car great. I bought a subsription so my wife can foward them to me overseas. They told us it would take 6-10 weeks and they weren't lying. It took just over 10 weeks to get my first issue. We ordered her a Cosmo subscription and had in 3 weeks. What could possibly cause them to take that long to deliver. Again, I love the magazine and hopefully the initial issue will be my only problem."
4,Excellent car coverage for the money!,"Motor Trend is a basic staple for anyone who would claim to be an auto enthusiast. If your a woman looking for a great car magazine for the man in your life, you would do well to get him this magazine. If you're a car crazy male, then you will be well informed of the latest offerings from all the auto manufacturers. You won't find modified vehicles, they only review what the manufacturer offers. I do have one complaint and it is that they tend to favor BMW in their comparisons. But if you can read between the lines, you will be able to glean the info you need to make educated decisions when considering a new auto."
4,Purchased for my husband who LOVES cars!,"My husband reads several car magazines. He had been buying Motor Trend at the store each month. When I saw the price at Amazon, I bought a subscription for him. It's MUCH cheaper than buying it at the store. He likes Motor Trend and Car & Driver the best. He had a subscription for Road and Track, but didn't like it and let the subscription lapse."
3,Wouldn't subscribe if it wasn't so cheap,"Pros: Its cheapCons: Too many articles on high-end cars. Every month it seems like they re-review another Cadillac, or another Mercedes, or another Ferrari. Its very lacking in the economy car, and mid-size car categories. They tend to care little about value or fuel economy and too often leave out very common cars out of their comparison articles. They almost never go back and rereview a car they featured a few years back, which would be great to see how that car has held up after getting some miles on it. It totally lacks any mechanical articles, which would be nice once in awhile. All in all, I wouldn't subscribe if not for the ability to catch a good deal on it once in awhile (.50 cents an issue or less)."
4,Better than ever,"Several times in the past I've almost completely given up on Motor Trend. I even canceled my subscription on two occasions. My main gripe during those times? Too darned many trucks and SUVs. Sure, that's what the U.S. public seems to want, and ""Trend"" does appear in the name, but boooooring. When they released Truck Trend as a sister publication, I danced for joy and then fell flat on my face when MT seemed to STILL spend 2/3 of every issue on hulking boringmobiles.In recent months Motor Trend has come full circle and again seems to be focusing on interesting articles about cars. Trucks and SUVs are hardly missing, but in that respect and others MT is tremendously better than it was, say, two years ago. The transformation is nearly astounding. I can still remember the first time I closed the back flap of the latest issue and suddenly thought ""Holy smokes, that was GOOD!""Now definitely worth reading again!"
1,Arrived broken,"This wooden nutcracker ornament arrived broken. The hat was detached from the head. Additonally, the team name printed on the hat did not match the team uniform. (The hat had a B on it, but it was supposed to be a NY Mets ornament.) There was no receipt in the box or instructions for returning it. Additonally, the return address on the box was not the seller's address. I had no way of returning the item: I went to the seller's website and it provided instructions for returning the ornament using information from the receipt. Thankfully, this was not an expensive purchase."
3,not very good,"Tony Carey's Some Tough City takes me back to my childhood of when 80's music was popular, and how commercial and inferior the music scene quickly turned into compared to the more interesting and experimental 70's rock scene. This Tony Carey album is exactly what you would expect 80's rock to sound like. Every song sounds the same, the music and lyrics come off sounding more important than they really are, the vocal melodies are all nearly identical to each other and as a result it's easy to get one song confused with another, etc. It suffers from everything that stunk about the 80's.""Fine Fine Day"" is a decent song, but Tony wanted to make the entire record sound like that song, or maybe he was just the victim of the whole 80's scene. Either way, it's an alright album that's really only playing on my stereo if I'm in the mood to be reminded about my childhood, which isn't often. Still, if you like 80's rock, this album won't disappoint."
3,Why do we have to name this?,This book is fun. The activities are cool and the illistrations are good. I'm not how-to book person but this book is neat.
2,Price?,I wouldn't purchase 13 poems/activities for almost $100 dollars no matter how many common items there are for the experiments. YOU have GOT to be KIDDING!
2,"Cute, clever, and simplistic on a profound subject","Robert Capon is a dedicated thinker, but he is a bit too cute to get to some real meat of the thought problem. The book did nothing to answer some of the theological questions that I have as a Christian of strong faith but still one with many questions. He provides little reasoning or rationale, just an admonition that faith and belief is all that is required. Christ is a mystery so leave it there and just believe! Just don't think to heavily."
5,Great Product!,"Very fast shipping on the DVD. If you're looking for a great DVD that portrays the history of D-Day and WWII, this is a must buy. I would recommend this product to anyone."
2,Poor quality pictures,"This D-Day 2 disc set is basically some old US Government 1944/45 news and documentary films put together without any cleaning up of the aged and faded film. It has been combined with a narration by the same rather uninteresting voice.Although the set does give a lot of interesting information on D-Day and it's subsequent battles,many picures are faded with age and other more recent modern day documentaries are much better viewing.Other documentary films like The World At War or World War Two in color have much better picture quality than this old set and are much better buys."
3,Not bad,"Not bad, but much better documentaries on D-Day are out there. The narration is bland, and the video is poor. I suggest getting D-Day Code Name: Overlord, or D-Day The Total Story instead, as both of those boxed sets are FAR superior. I own many D-Day documentaries and my favorite is D-Day Code Name: Overlord."
1,A huge let down!,The title sounds great but the documentary is lousy. The whole show is in black and white and colour as stated in here. I sold it on ebay only three days after getting the DVD show how bad the show is.
2,Poor Construction,"We purchased this Pill Organizer after using the same type for a few years. The last one lasted a few years, but this one has started falling apart in one trip. On a few of the pouches, the zipper tab has come out in the fist day of use. I tried to put them back but no luck.Very poorly built - low quality."
4,Zorro Rocks,"If you love Zorro, you will love this.I'm a Zorro Fanatic, so I almost always love whatever Zorro I can watch, so this collection was great."
1,WASTE WASTE WASTE OF MONEY!,"Don't let the picture on the cover fool you. This is NOT Zorro! This is the Lone Ranger dressed in black with a goofy mask, and with two six guns and a whip. He doesn't even have a sword!!! I'm sorry, this baloney with cowboys riding around on horses with six shooters like the old west, and other people driving around in cars dressed in 1930's and 40's suits and clothing just doesn't do it for me. Never has. And this crock about how he is the real Zorros' great grandson. Phooey! Only one star because I can't give it minus stars. TOTAL JUNK!! I waited with great excitement for this thing too! And shame on who ever put that picture on the cover. And even more shame on who ever let them do it! Very misleading. Scumbags!!!"
5,Song of the Soul,"Cheryl Exum has done the most thorough investigation ever of the Song of Songs, exploring its eroticism to the fullest while expounding and critiquing the full range of perspectives found in the history of Christian commentary."
3,Not thick enough,"This bath oil should be more thick so it can coat my skin better. It says to use it in the shower but I feel like it washes right off with water. The Aveeno Bath Oil did not make a difference in my skin, I think I'm going to stick with creams and lotions. Regular Petroleum jelly works well for dry skin."
5,under da influence,"STR8 FIRE-essential frisco rap from tha kill-a-hoes stayin udi til they die all thier albumz slam hella clean thru tha fierce flowz so copp em & get up on the OAKDALE MOB (Cold World Hustlers,Dush Tray,U.D.I.,11/5,380 & Pho Balo)"
4,Good to own this album,This U.D.I album is good if you get it you should also check out Cold World Hustlers and 11/5 !!!
4,Big Ups to this San Francisco Duo,"Captures what was happening in the Hip-Hop scene in San Francisco, back in the early 90's. UDI (Under Da Influence) is a duo composed of Dig (Derrick Reed) and Quint (Quinton Morris) two natives of San Francisco, California, whose reserve demeanor belie the raw game found in the content of their music. This duo incorporates their love of music and their love of the game to create a sound guaranteed to have you high off the vibe.Not to mention the intoxicating affects of their mesmerizing grooves, which will have you body entranced into some rump-shaking moves. The hypnotic beat of 'Thug Thang' will have you on the edge of your seat and 'Eyes On My Ride' and 'Smoke Wit Me'for sure will move you onto the dance floor. Don't forget to roll your blunt, for 'All I Want To Do'.This was the only album UDI ever put out, due to their untimely deaths not too long after this release."
4,Really useful and interesting,"To speak frankly as a US citizen with an interest in Film Studies, I never quite know what the heck is going on in Canadian cinema, nor where I should be looking. So this book fills a serious void for me, and has a diversity of entries, some more academic than others (but almost all good), that offer lucid and interesting introductions to the wealth of visual culture being produced in Canada over the past decades. I really like the essays on Native filmmakers Loretta Todd and Alanis Obomsawin, and think the editors did a great job of casting their net widely.I highly recommend this book, though I wish it were cheaper."
3,Just OK,"As the title says, this travel pillow was ""Just OK"" for me. It is definitely great quality, but it just didn't fit my well. The memory foam was too thick for me, and didn't really give enough to cushion. I was looking for something to give me a little support while on the plane. If you need your neck to be totally immobilized this will get the job done."
4,"Very Nice 7"" Digital Photo Frame","I was pleasantly surprised by this unit. I had never before purchased a digital phoro frame and was pleased with the aesthetic quality of the frame itself, the LCD picture quality, the slideshow features, video capability, and size of this unit. It accepts a wide variety of media card formats and has a fairly simple data transfer method to its 128MB of internal memory. I am preloading this item with pictures and sending as a gift. My only complaints are the somewhat quirky menu system and the lack of a battery feature (must use power cord). But overall I am very happy."
3,Westinghouse photo fram,"This photoframe was easy to setup and use straight out of the box. It sizes photo larger than 5x7 easily down to the 5x7 format without the need to spend extensive time in with photo editing software. For a standard resolution frame, the pictures look good. Buttons along the top of the frame allow a mosaic or single pictures to be displayed. The frame accepts several different memory cards including SD type. Instructions are a little sparce, but the buttons and menus are not difficult to work out. One word of caution through, the frame does not come with a USB cable to connect to the computer."
4,Good Product,This is an inexpensive frame in comparison and has cool features that aren't on a lot of these digital frames. I love the mosaic feature for displaying my paintings.
4,Great product for the price,"Easy to use even for a novice.....liked the first one so much, I bought another."
2,Terrible Resolution,We bought 2 digital picture frames for Christmas gifts this year. One of the frames was the Westinghouse 7-inch. I am very disapointed and will be bringing it back and exchanging it for the Kodak EasyShare which has an excellent picture.Don't waste your money. The pictures are dark and grainy. Spend a little more and get the Kodak.
1,"Do not buy this digital picture frame, stay away!!!!","Do not buy this digital picture frame, stay away!!!! Normally, I rarely write reviews on any product I purchase, but I had to for this one. I went cheap and got this thinking it can't be that bad. I was really disappointed after I received it. The picture quality is horrible. I decided to use this for myself at my office and purchase a better one as a gift for my parents. I got the HP 8"" 800x600 digital picture frame from BestBuy. I brought my SD memory card and tested it there. HP DF800 8"" Digital Frame Part Number: DF800B It comes with a remote and cost about $129, well for the money."
1,This frame expired right after the warranty period ran out,"This frame didn't last much longer than the warranty period. When I called the Westinghouse folks, their customer service advisor said to toss it out as they don't service them, even for a charge. We paid about $150 at the time for it, so it was truly not worth the money. Lovely gift while it lasted, just didn't last long enough."
1,Don't Waste Your $,"I bought this frame because I could get pictures off of my computer and put them on it. I did this and that was easy. The problem with this frame is that after about 6 months it started having color issues and the pictures were turning pink and distorted. At 7 months it completely stopped working. It has a 6 month warranty and therefore, I lost $80.00.I am very disappointed in the quality."
1,Poor Quality and Defective,"My husband purchased this frame for me for an anniversary gift. We took it out, followed the instructions, inserted our memory card, and pressed the power button. However, all of the photos load off center. So, this item was defective. In addition, it is very grainy and dark. We're going to return it and get a kodak which are supposed to be more reliable."
4,Remember when,"I bought this so we could download pictures. I love the fact that sometimes I forget which pictures are on there and I love watching them scroll and remembering all of the fun moments our family has shared. I like that I can load a lot of photos and I can add photos and I won't lose the original ones I put on there. I should use it more than I do, but with a couple little ones running around, I had to find a safer place for it so it wouldn't get broken. Even with the falls it has been durable, has not cracked or broken and the pictures are still there and have nice quality."
1,If it worked...,"then I would at least have something to say... unfortunately, they cancelled the order because they were backordered. So I received a broken frame and now can't get another one."
4,Westinghouse Frame - Good purchase,"Westinghouse 7-Inch Wide LCD Digital Photo FrameThe Westinghouse frame was an overall good purchase. The only problem was that some of the pictures had to be resized b/c they wouldn't fit on the screen. (Tip - It doesn't matter weather the pic are the same size pixels wise, some get cut off and others don't. My suggestion - upload all of the photos you want and then flip through them to figure out which are getting cut off. Then, open those pics in ""Paint"" and make them smaller.) Other than that, the pictures were pretty clear and the frame was a good quality."
5,tunesmith,This product works great for keeping moisture down. For my purposes the sachet packets work great and are preferred over the other DampRid products. My local store doesn't carry this product so Amazon came through for once more!
2,Nice design; awful sound quality,"This is an interesting headphone design that works to keep sweat out of the headphone mechanism, but the sound quality is unbelievably bad. I thought the stock iPod earbuds were bad, but they sound worlds better than these. No bass at all."
5,CLASSICS are the best,"at the gym i sweat and nothing annoys me more than having to continue sticking my headphones back in my ears;THESE classics dont let that happen, they are secure and sound good."
1,Will not last a month.,Dido what another reviewer said. I am a runner and have used these earphones for years. I had one pair that lasted about three years. Eventually I would ruin them with my rough handling but they fit well and had fair quality sound. When the pair I had for three years broke I could not find them in the store. I did find them on Amazon so I bought 3 pairs of them in case Sony was going to quit making them. None of the three pair lasted a month. they all broke at the hindge. Obviously Sony has out sourced these to some hack company that can't build quality products. I will now be suspicious of all Sony products.
5,works for running,"The earphones that came with my iPod Nano were just falling out too much so I bought these. They work just fine for running and I have no complaints. I've been using them for a couple weeks, running five times a week, up to four miles. Due to the cold weather I've been putting a knit cap over the earphones, but they seem secure without the cap as well. Not sure about them breaking where they fold--I never fold them, as I just use them for running. I have jerked the wire hard a couple times while running, and while one of the speakers pulls out of my ear, they haven't broken yet. They sit comfortably in my ears and have decent sound while I'm running. All I could ask for in headphones for running, so I can recommend them."
1,Split in half in one wearing,Most fragile headphones I have ever bought. Just split in half in my hands after wearing them once.
3,BROKE ALREADY,"I've had them for less than a month, and the arm broke where it adjusts on the side... already! But hey, other than that, the sound quality is not bad."
1,Don't waste you're money!,The thing broke the third time I took it off my head. I have a big head but it isn't that big!
1,How can these be called sports headphones???,"Bought a pair of these and they lasted one week until they broke. I'm a 48 year old man who uses them to listen to books on tape while commuting. Hardly a ""sports users"". Don't buy these unless you buy in bulk."
2,"Good sound, but broke easily","I really enjoyed the sound and sweat guard, however after about a month of use one earpiece broke off when I was unfolding the headphones. I'm clearly disappointed. Hopefully I just got a ""lemon""."
1,Broke after 1 week of normal use,"These headphones broke after a week of normal use. I used them for about a total 5 hours and loved them, until they suddenly broke as I was putting them on. It's too bad, too, because they were very comfortable."
2,Great while it lasted,"I'll echo what others have said -- even though you'll only be able to hear my words in your right ear. Yes, after about 8 or 9 months, the left side has gone dead on my pair of these too. So annoying! I can't say as how I've treated them w/ kid gloves, but I haven't been jumping up and down on 'em either. And they *are* SPORTS headphones. Oh well. Wish I could find something better...."
1,Good sound but easily breakable.,"I enjoyed the sound quality of these headphones, however, they are incredibly flimsy and I accidently broke off one of the ear-bud arms just by tring to take them off my head with one hand. I cannott recommend these, especially for people who are looking for something durable. Learned my lesson, guess I'll have to buy a more expensive and better-built style."
3,"I'm torn...and unfortunately, so are my headphones","These headphones are terrific besides the fact that they definitely have a tendency to snap in half - please listen to these reviews. My first pair snapped the first week, my second a few months after purchase. They are great headphones while they last, but I have to say they're just not worth buying until Sony makes them with a more flexible, less rigid plastic."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY!,"I know, I know! I read the reviews and bought these headphones anyway. What can I say, I/m stupid. I just figured the other guys were way to rough. What a joke. I was sooo careful, and they sounded GREAT! Well they sounded great until they BROKE IN HALF! Actually, they still sound great, but it doesn't matter since I cannot wear them. DON'T BE A SCHMUCK...LIKE ME! They lasted 2 weeks...what a shame."
2,Headphones keep breaking,"I loved the idea of folding headphones because I store them in my gym bag daily. I consider myself a gentle user of these headphones, but my last two headsets have snapped where the folding mechanism is. I don't know what's going on, but it very frustrating to be out on the road for a run and all of sudden my headphones fall off. I can't wear the ear buds because they don't stay in my ears, so I just purchased the sony headphones that do not fold and hoping for better luck.I do not recommed these to anyone who uses headphones regularly."
2,Great phones but too fragile. And the price went up!,"Well, the other reviews were right. They break entirely too easily. I bought a pair and they were great for my workouts. But one day I was extending one of the earphone legs and it snapped in half. But I liked the phones so much, and they were cheap, so I figured, ""I can afford to buy these if I can get six months or so use of them."" So I bought two more pairs and was really careful with these.Well they lasted about six months each and I went to buy more pairs but the price went up 50%! So I'm switching to something that might last longer.There are three potential break points: each earphone leg extends to your comfort level. each of these can break at the extension point. Also the phones fold in three places: at the extension points and in the middle of the headband piece. The last pivot place can also break (twice in my case). Thin metal in place of thin plastic would make much more sense."
2,Wicked Lame Headphones,"These headphones are the least durable sports headphones I have ever owned. They do possess a good sound and unlike other headphones, it's tough to block any sound or music with too much sweat.BUT, BUT, BUT...I just broken my second set. They are made of a really brittle plastic so they are not good for any kind of more intense working out."
3,Good sweat protection but delicate,"I've just gone through my third and last pair. These headphones do a good job of keeping sweat from obscuring the sound while I run, but two of the three pairs I've had have broken in my hands. I'm quite careful but the plastic holding the side joints together is very fragile, even in warm weather (Miami and Antigua). One pair broke as I removed them from my head with two hands; the other broke as I tried to tape another crack! Their low cost has kept me coming back, but I'm growing tired of carrying my headphones back from a run."
2,Very fragile headphones,"I bought three pairs of these and they all have broken within one month. They snap right near the folding joint with the slightest overstress. The sound is good, but I'm very disappointed with the durability. I had an old Sony metal band folding sport headphone that lasted for many years that I wish they still sold. If you buy these, make sure to get some plastic glue and a pin punch so you can take them apart and repair them. You'll need it."
4,Gets the job done.,"As stated in a prior review, these are sports headphones. They are not built for superior sound quality, although the sound is more than adequate and may suprise you.They are perfect for what they were intended to be: anti-sweat, sports headphones for working out, running, ect..exercise in general.They are somewhat fragile and need to be handled with care. They fold up really nicely for storage. I find them to be slightly uncomfortable with extended periods of use. All in all they get the job done and are worth the money."
4,Great headphones for price,I loved these headphones buy unfortunately I broke them. I'll buy more! They truly worked as advertised.
1,"Nice design, but not sturdy enough","Like many others, I had these headphones for about 6 months, when one side stopped working. The replacement pair broke in half under very little pressure. When these work, they are very good for exercise, but they are not sturdy enough to recommend."
1,"sorry, can't recommend this . . .","I tried two pair of these. I loved the fit. Sound was fine. They actually stayed in my ears during speed intervals, which is more than I can say for the three other options I've tried. But they break SO easily! First pair broke at the hinge where they fold after I'd only used them two times. I thought it was me and ran out to get another pair.This morning as I went to put on the second pair after NEVER using them, they broke at the top hinge. If these work for you, you have my congratulations. But I didn't feel I handled them roughly at all and felt they wouldn't hold up to any wear at all. Since the earbuds I've tried don't stay in my ears over the course of the run, I'm still looking for the perfect set of sport headphones."
1,"If you are a runner, don't get these.","The good: they fit good and they sound good. The fatal flaw: the speaker faces forward so as you run, the wind creates a whistle in your ear. As you run, you hear a loud and annoying whistle, which makes this product worthless to a runner."
3,good headphones but fragile,"I liked these for the most part, but the plastic is cheap and they broke pretty quick because of that. The sound still works, but the headphones had to be taped back together. Good for cheap headphones, but lacking true quality craftsmanship."
2,I loved these ... for 3 months ... until they broke!,"I loved these headphones. Good sound, good moisture/sweat resistance, stayed put in my ears way more comfortably than the ear buds that came with my 30GB iPod. I used them several times each week -- at the gym, and on long runs outside. I was careful with them, seeing as the plastic was thin, and having read the other reviewers on Amazon. And then all of a sudden, the headband broke as I was getting on the treadmill this week, not even dropping or squeezing or crushing them in any peculiar way..."
3,They're ok,"The Sony headphones aren't anything spectacular, they're just alright. I notice some crackling when I hook them up to any device, but they're sturdy and compact. I just put them in my purse and go."
1,Very Fragile,The quality of these headphones are not up to par. I went through two sets of these within 45 days; therefore I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase these headphones. Sony should WITHDRAW this item from the market!!
2,"Everyone is right, these will break SUPER easily","I foolishly ignored many of the reviews here stating how easily these headphones broke. I've been a happy owner of folding Sony sport headphones for over 15 years and never had a problem, so I assumed these headphones would work just as well. For a month they worked alright (although there were notably more uncomfortable than previous models due to a slightly larger earbud that didn't fit well in my ear). I went running yesterday wearing a sweatband and my earbud filled up with sweat (I dunno what the sweat guard was supposed to do, but it didn't work this time). I pulled the earbud out far enough to try to get some moisture out of my ear (something I've done with every other Sony headset I've owned) and ""SNAP!"" there it went. Now I only wish someone other than Sony (or some weird discount brand) made these style of headsets as well as they used to..."
2,"Sound great, will break in a minute","I've been through two pair of these, and each one broke just by putting it on. Like the other reviews say, they are not worth the money."
3,"Works good for a while, then poof. Mono.","I bought one pair, worked fine for about a year then one ear piece stopped working. Bought another pair. Worked fine for another year then one ear piece stopped working. Coincidence? Perhaps not. I'm buying yet another pair because they're now only about eight bucks and not much else out there. But SONY - There is must be something wrong with these babies. Your reputation is flagging."
2,"Good sound, bad construction",Mine broke after just a few weeks. Snapped at joint where headphone extends. Good sound but poorly designed.
1,Left side went out,"I noticed a number of other reviews with the same problem, so I thought I might as well chime in. Yes, I have the same problem, namely the left side of the headphones went out after only 3 or 4 uses in the gym (there was no excessive or rough treatment of the headphones at all). My old headphones from about 8 years ago lasted for 8 years under the exact same conditions (until I accidentally snapped them)"
4,"Good headphones, not for everyone though","These are a good set of headphones. They are ok at everything, great at nothing. Bass, midbass, treble are all average. Where these headphones standout is when working out, especially running.They allow you to hear just enough to make them safe but filter out most of the noise. But comfort is their biggest bonus. Earbud headphones falloff. Wrap-arounds leave your ears red and sore. Closed ear types absorb sweat, and look odd. These are the perfect compromise. They don't fall out, don't pinch your ear, and they have a canal for sweat to roll down and out of your ear.Bottom line, if you want library headphones look somewhere else. You want a workout set this is your model."
4,Sweat!,"On my 4 mile jog this morning I was thinking I should come back and post a great review of how these headphones have worked so well. Then a big drop of sweat landed in my ear and created this popping noise everytime the earphone created a seal in my ear canal and then broke the seal. I had to take the headphones off for the last mile since it was too annoying.This is my third pair of headphones in my quest for the perfect jogging headphones. I'm starting to think there is not a ""perfect"" set out there. These have come the closest of any. They stay in place which is huge. They sound OK. The sweat wasn't a problem until today (which was my 3rd time jogging with them). I guess I needed to point it out since they advertise a sweat guard mechanism. I sweat ALOT, so it doesn't surprise me that this feature doesn't work quite right. Maybe I sweat inside my ears??For the price, I think these headphones are worth the attempt to see if they work for you and your excercise pursuits."
2,Do NOT last,"I'm a big runner (6 miles a day) and these headphones are the best for comfort. But - be warned - they do not last. I've been using them for several years and have never gotten more than a few months out of a pair. In the past, I've gotten a warranty and just traded them in, but they now are making the warranty process more difficult.If you're looking for sports headphones - these are good. If you're looking for headphones that last, I would look elsewhere."
2,Very Fragile,Excellent sound quality and good base. They are very fragile. Snapped at the hinge after one week of use.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I think this is the first time in years I have felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.On first use, these headphones are okay. They sound relatively good, although the sounds tends to break up a bit at higher frequencies. They feel relatively good, although it took my ears a few painful days to get used to the pressure in my ears.The problem? THEY BREAK EASILY. I went through two pairs in three weeks. Both times, the cheap plastic snapped in half. And, for the record, I was not tough on them. This was after using them only on my daily commute.Bottom line, these headphones are junk. It's too bad. Look at another model, and beware -- because, if you buy them, these will break on you, too."
1,bad product,"I've had this model headphones for like 4 years now. Each year I have had to replace them cause one of the earphones would die... but that didnt bother me that much with how much I was using them. The last 2 I bought in the last 3 months have been horrible. The quality of the plastic has drastically decreased. Both have snapped at the hindge point hear the ear buds. Both times they occured while they were in my gym bag. Until they correct this, I cannot recommend this product."
3,Easily Broken,"This headphones were easy to pack up for the gym, and they really worked quite well. They produced great sound and kept the sweat out of my ears. The only complaint is how easily they broke. I brought 2 pairs nad both broke within 2 monthes."
2,Broke easily!,"These headphones snapped when I went to pick them up but one side got caught underneath something. They broke, and it surprised me a lot since I've never had a pair of headphones break so easily before. I had read another review that said they broke easily, but I thought it wouldnt happen to me because its not like I put them to rough use. But with simple household use, it did! Not happy about that."
2,"Good sound, bad quality.","Like every other bad reviewer my pair broke within 3 months. I barely even touched them and they just snapped apart. (Strangely enough, when I got angry and tried to crush them completely they put up quite a fight.)Good sound, bad quality plastic."
2,They Broke Too Soon,"these headphones were comfy, and i liked the white ""sporty"" detailing, but they broke on one side at the hinge within a few months. i took them out of my backpack, unfolded them, and *snap*! it was often in my backpack's outer pocket, but with heavy books & a laptop, i might have put too much pressure on it at times."
2,very flimsy,The sound is fine and they work well for exercise until they break. I have had 2 pair break each with a couple months of purchase at one of the 2 bottom hinges The guy next to me at the gym had the same thing happen as well. I would recommend an alternative that doesn't fold up.
1,Easy to break,"I only had these for a few weeks before one of the arms broke off at the pivot point (where the arm that has the ear bud on it folds up). It didn't break from rough use either; it broke just from me unfolding them. I super-glued the arm back on and that worked for about a week until they broke again; in a different spot!! At that point I gave up and decided I needed a more durable pair of headphones. The sound quality was excellent and they were very comfortable to wear, but you apparently need to wear kid-gloves to handle them."
4,Only Headphones that fit,"Hi I had these for 2 years in a zip pouch in my gym bag. Other models such as ear buds and the Sony waterproof model with plastic covers are too large for my ears-- they hurt. I gave them to my husband and daughter. The behind the ear ones fall off and pull and these ""old style"" phones are the only ones I can wear . For the price and the sound quality and comfort it's a value. As a musician I appreciate the sound range vs light weight. My husband cannot believe the sound quality I'm getting on these cheap lightweights. I'm wearing them, they are not wearing me. Why am I ordering more? I lent them to my teenager in the car and she broke them instantly of course. They do work great duct taped, but I'm buying extra pairs to stash. And I'm not lending them to anybody!"
4,Almost Perfect...,"Almost perfect because they have great sound, great fit, stay put during workouts and are easy to carry safely in My Gym Bag. Why Almost then??? Because for them to be Perfect they would have to have an ""In-Line Volume Control"". With an In-Line Volume Control You can turn them down so that You can Talk and Listen without taking the Headphones off and You can also adjust the volume without having to take your MP-3 or iPod off your waist and look at it to adjust the volume... a real pain in the butt actually. P.S.: The sweat guard works great but, only if the skin on your ears doesn't sweat."
4,I like 'em.,I keep a pair in my car and another in my gym bag. I like the compactness - I carry them in an old case for my glasses. The sound is fine and you can wear them while sweating like a pig and they still manage not to feel disgusting. They are my friend.
2,Good until they broke,These headphones have great sound and they stay on your head.Downside - 1. Sweatguard doesn't work well 2. One side broke after a couple weeks.
1,Should have listened to the reviews,"The product worked well and was comfortable, but quite a few reviews talked about how fragile they were. As careful as I was folding them and caring form them, after about 1 month I accidently flexed them the wrong direction and the hinge on one side snapped and broke, rendering the headphones useless."
1,JUNK!,"In the last 2 months I have gone through 2 sets of these. The first set broke at the top hinge, then one of the arms holding the ear piece snapped. I foolishly bought a 2nd set, and the same exact thing happened! Luckily I was able to return one set (didn't have receipt for the other). I would not purchase this product!!"
4,Durable,I use these sweat guard headphones for non-aerobic purposes. They are the perfect compliment to my laptop because the ear buds that came with my computer purchase don't fit my ears. These headphones are light and durable. I can haul them around with my laptop quite easily. I like that they fold so they don't get in the way or get broken when I carry them around. They are comfortable in my ears and they don't smash my hair. I do a lot of writing in cafes so I was surprised how much noise this headset is able to block out. The sound quality isn't bad at all for the price.
4,good deal headphones,"These heradphones are perfect for my gymbag. I like that they fold up. I prefer them to earbuds...these stay put while I run. Earbuds always fall out on me. The sound quality is much better than cheap, knock-offs."
2,ALL PLASTIC,"I liked these headphones, but they were all plastic. The adjustable part broke after three weeks. I super glued them several times then tossed the over-the-head band. I still have the speaker parts; a baseball cap will hold them in place while I am searching for new headphones. I would not buy them again."
1,don't waste your money,"Total piece of garbage. The left earpiece died within two weeks of use, the right earpiece died about a week later. Visible cracks in the wire casing, exposing the copper wires. No complaints about the sound, just the terrible, terrible quality and poor durability. I did not abuse these any more than a typical runner/gym-goer. Most of the time they lived in a small zippered compartment in my gym bag, now they are in the garbage."
1,buy several pairs since they'll snap at the hinges,"These headphones sound great and stay on while working out, but...DO NOT BUY THEM - I have snapped several pairs in the past 6 months and have switched to ear buds. Horrible quality - they'd be better with no hinges."
2,Left headphone always fails,"I have been buying and replacing these headphones for a few years now. The left side always stops working after a few months. I know they take a lot of sweat but it is always the left side. My most recent pair only worked one month. I think it is time for me to find another cheap pair for workouts, since I'm pretty aggravated with the durability."
2,sweat guard is a joke... great while they lasted,"These headphone had great sound, until they crapped out. I used them exclusively at the gym, and on a fairly regular basis, one side or the other would go out from sweat. Maybe I sweat more than the average person, but I bought these especially because they were supposed to be designed with the gym in mind.After they would dry out, they would usually work again. Until finally they didn't. At the gym, one side went out, and has never come back, weeks later."
3,Not very comfortable,"I've had these for several months and they work fine, but I have a couple of problems with them. I have small ears and I find that these don't sit well in my ear (I have to keep adjusting), and they are not very comfortable. Another problem is that you can't wear them with a baseball cap.UPDATE- Had these for about two years before one of the earpieces stopped working. I would not buy these again."
3,Good while they last,My left headphone also went out after a few months. But they were decent headphones while they lasted. I will probably buy another pair. I think I'd rather frequently replace cheap headphones then invest in an expensive pair and risk those busting too.
2,I have owned Sony Sport Headphones for over 10 years,"Usually the headphone's speakers go bad (too much sweat/moisture I'm guessing). Recently this happened and I bought Sony's latest offering. After 2 weeks, the flimsy plastic snapped. Others here have complained about the same thing. so buyer beware"
2,gone through 3 pairs... and will not buy again!,"I have owned three pairs of these headphones and do not plan to buy another pair. They have a great fit and good sound but the ear buds short out after 6 months to a year. Unforunately, these are the only pair of headphones I could find in electronic stores that have this type of fit and compatibility. I wish another brand would come out with a similar style!"
2,Painful,"I'm a ridiculous headphone snob, so I don't live with headphones/earphones that don't meet up to my standards. And these don't live up to my standards. The sound is okay, but the biggest problem is that they don't fit very well in the ear. You can push them right up against the ear canal, but leaving them there for more than five minutes caused my ears to hurt like crazy. Then I push them back on my ear, but then I lose ALL bass response. So, back to the store they go.Trust me, if your ears are sensitive to pressure, these headphones will kill your ears to the point where it's uncomfortable to wear them even more than an hour."
1,Garbage.... Always Break,"Broke 3 times in 3 different spots within 3 weeks! Cheap brittle plastic breaks very easily. The sound is great, and the waterproof is great, but what good is that if you can't wear them. I'm not very rough with them either.Do yourself a favor and buy the version that does not fold up. I had those for years and bought the fold up ones because I lost my non-fold up version. The non-foldup version has the same sound, very durable, and seem to last forever."
2,Flimsy headphones. They break very easily.,"I'm not especially rough on my gear but I've had to tape these ""sports"" headphones up three times after they kept breaking. They are really brittle. They break off at the part above the earphones and the middle part that goes over your head They do sound good but just don't handle them alot and be very careful when putting them on or taking them off because they don't bend well, they just snap. You may think I'm over exagerating but I'm not. You need to slip them off very gingerly or else you'll end up with two or more pieces in both hands.I've had other sports headphones before that were far more durable (and flexible). After these are gone for good I'm getting another brand. I recommed you keep looking for a different brand as well."
2,Slightly dissapointed,"The ear pieces are not as comfortable as I had hoped and the cord is shorter than I expected. The head part seems very cheap, but the ear pieces are good quality and will not fall out. Hopefully they will last longer than some of my headphones in the past, but overall, I think this item is a bit overpriced."
4,Great product for the price,"I've used these headphones for jogging for three years now and have had no problems at all. Very good stereo sound for the money, and if you're reasonably careful with them, they'll last forever. If you fold roughly or sit on them in the car, of course they'll break. But I fold mine every day and keep them in a drawer in between daily jogs, and mine are still going strong. And even if they break now, for $15 I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product again."
3,Break too easily,"These have great sound & are very comfortable. They stay on while jogging & doing other exercise. I've had 2 pairs, both times they broke when they were accidentally knocked off my head & fell about 5 feet to the ground. They are heavier then other sports headphones I've had due to the way they fold up, and I think that is why they break so easily."
1,Should be zero stars,"I'm amazed at all the people who've given this three plus stars even though they've broken multiple units. They are decent, while they work, but for the price of three sets you could get something better to begin with. They are good for working out, but my first set broke after three months. I figured I'd be more careful with the second set, but they broke after 1 month. Both broke at the hinges, just like everyone else's. Now I'm out the money spent on those two sets and I have to invest more $$ in something decent that will last. These are garbage, save yourself the aggravation and buy something better."
2,Breaks easily,I owned these headphones for about 3 months & absolutely loved it. I used it while working out & it fit perfectly. Good sound; felt comfortable in the ears; & quite compact. But as others have noted; it snapped in 2 pieces at the joints. Would not recommend these.
2,great till they break,"if you are going to keep these in a gentle place, such as on your desk, they will be pretty good, as they sound great for the money.but, if you're gonna take em to the gym or anyplace, THEY'LL BUST, just like all else say. just the slightest pressure OUTWARD and the 1/8 inch thick piece between the head piece and ear piece snaps.i bought four pairs (gym, desk, office, extra). the only one that didn't break within a couple of months is the one on my office desk, where it only has to travel from the desktop to my head and back."
3,good sound,The sound and portabiliy of these headphones is great but the durability is not. I purchased 2 pairs and broke both of them within a few months. I got them tangled up and the pivot points are weak. They will be fine if you are very careful which I am not.
1,sony sports headphones BEWARE!!!,these headphones are awful. They break very easily and I don't have a strenuous workout in the gym. My first pair snapped but I went back for more and bought another pair that broke within a week. BEWARE!!!!!!!!
1,Don't fold 'em,"As I recieved these headphones, I was excited. I had a pair just like these for years and they had finally succumbed to the stress and overwork that I put them through. I pulled them out of the box, excited and ready to listen to some good music. What happened next I never expected... as I unfolded them, the right extension snapped clean off. Now I'm waiting hopefully for a refund. If you're not going to fold them up, it might be worth the money. If you are going to fold them, look for another pair."
2,Took a VERY long time to receive,"There should be an obvious note when purchasing that they are shipping via USPS because I entered our physical address thinking it would be shipped via UPS. We don't receive USPS mail at our physical address, so it got sent back and the seller wouldn't ship a new one until they received the old one back. It took almost OVER a month from the day I ordered it until the day I received it. Also, when emailing the seller, it was difficult to get a response most of the time."
3,Nice fit but lasts only 90 days,"These headphones fit well and are much better than the ear bud styles. Those never stay in place. I also like how they collapse, and are therefore much more portable to take the gym.The downside I have experienced is these phones have lasted me about 90 days and then stop working.I use them almost daily on the treadmill and can feel the sweat building up. It appears that the sweat eventually shorts out the earphones.I do like these headphones for overall performance and cost. I keep several on hand, knowing they won't last very long. My issue is they unexpectedly stop working, usually in the middle of my workout, and must finish my workout on the treadmill in silence.I will try the behind the head version as well."
1,"4 for sound, 0 for durability",I've had four pairs of these headphones; each pair has snapped at the earpiece. The first two pairs lasted a good long while before breaking but recently I broke two pairs in two weeks. (Fortunately I had a replacement plan so the second was free.) The foldability isn't worth it. Go for the much cheaper and far more durable ones that don't fold.
2,very flimsy,Earbuds snapped off on both sides accidentally without much force. Sound quality is decent. Handle with extreme caution!
4,"Great for exercise, but buy two","You can't beat these as workout headphones. Decent sound quality, and they keep the sweat from pooling in your ears.However, as stated here, they do fail after a time. I just ordered two more sets. One for immediate use, and one for when those inevitably fail. But hey, at $14, if they last 6 months, I got my money's worth, I guess. Still, hopefully Sony will exercise a bit better quality control in the next iteration of the product."
2,Darn shame,I really like these headphones for the 2 or 3 months that they work. The first pair I bought the left ear stopped working after 2 or 3 months. Sony sent me a replacement and the left ear stopped working after 2 or 3 months. I am giving the additional star just because the headphones are really nice while they work.
2,7 Pairs Broken,"I like these headphones because they are water resistant, and they fold up nicely. They have fair sound quality, but more than adequate for using at the gym.The bad news is because they fold up there are 3 different hinges on them which I have managed to break 7-10 different times. My record life span for a pair of these headphones is 6 months. Typically they break within about 3 months.The reason I keep buying them is because they are cheap, and for the 13 bucks you can beat on them for 3 months until they break, but I am tired of replacing them now.If you are looking for something that lasts and is durable, steer clear of these headphones. If you are doing anything other than using them to work out, they are junk."
1,TOTAL JUNK DO NOT BUY,"I bought two of these for my morning runs and let me tell you they both broke in less than a month. Someone wrote a review saying that short of stepping on them they will not break, that is total nonsense, they are poorly made, and the plastic on the hinges broke on both of them. I was very carful with them and they snapped at the same hinge, BOTH of them. Sony makes other headphones much better, don't waste your time or money......."
1,until they break!,"I have owned more pairs of these folding headphones because of comfort & sound quality but durable they are NOT!!! go for modelW25 instead, they will last because they are FLEXIBLE!! I am gutted everytime the others break & I am careful taking them off & putting them on!! I have wasted so much money as I am the headphone queen! please be wise & get Sony to improve the folding type!!"
5,SOny headphones,"Prompt delivery of itemgood,quality headphonesI am quite pleased and would consider making purchases from this seller again"
1,Do not buy - they break easily,"I've bought this product twice, and both times they've broken in the same place (first time wasn't a fluke it appears). They are especially weak in the thin extendable part (between upper head piece and the ""sweat"" resitent thicker part). Also, sweat still gets in ear and clogs sound holes, so really, go for the cheaper headphones, which work just as well and last longer."
3,Disposable Headphones. Great Design but BREAKS TOO EASILY,"After breaking my fourth headphone after 2 weeks, I can no longer recommend these headphones.I would recommend the Sony MDR 25G S2 sports headphone WITHOUT the folding option. The folding joints break too easily.If you do order them, you should order multiple copies as you will need them. Or, be VERY careful each time you fold and unfold them...That said, these are great sports headphones. They are great for high sweat activites like running and allow enough ambient noise in to hear approaching hazards behind and around you. These headphones are far superior to the earbud types out there for athletic activity."
1,Sony MDR-A35G S2 Sports Headphones,"Sony typically makes good products. I had been searching for an inexpensive headphones set for my workout at the YMCA. I purchased this because it was inexpensive, made by Sony, and designed for workouts. Okay, the headphones lasted about one month before the sound became scratchy and I couldn't hear the sound out of one ear. Apparently the sweat or moisture has dripped down into the earpiece. Returning it to amazon.com is not an option at this point but I can certainly return it to Sony for a replacement under their 90 day warranty. You get what you pay for even applies to the most reputable companies. The cost of the headphones has increased by shipping costs to Sony plus my initial investment of $13.99. Apparently these headphones while designed for workouts require more care than anticipated."
3,Mediocre Headphones,"These headphones are truly middle of the road for me. On the plus side, they are comfortable and light. They fold up nicely to fit in my pocket, and they stay on my head when I'm running.The sound is good. Not great, but loud and clear. The bottom end is a little thin, but I prefer this to headphones that are too boomey.The construction is a little flimsy, and the sweat guard mech is a useless gimmick. I would recommend these headphones simply because I haven't been able to find anything better for running."
5,Finally,"They are comfortable, sound great, stay in when running....after going through several more expensive sets of headphones, these are keepers."
4,Typcical Sony Quality,The quality of this item is as high as any of the Sony products I have purchases over the years - excellent.
5,Very good sport phones...,"I was really surprised by the full and balanced response of these sport headphones. These are a very good alternative to ear buds when working out. Helping with the low end are 16mm drivers using Neodymium magnets. These are way beyond most ear buds and much better than my old Sony sport headphones for bass response. They seem very efficient and are easily driven by my MD player.These also fold into a small bundle that can be wrapped with the cord. They're water resistant too.If you are frustrated with buzzy ear buds that come loose as you sweat, try these. Well worth $20."
5,sony rocks,"great headphones, exactly what i wanted to replace original set that I had usedso much they needed replacing"
3,Excellent Sound but VERY Fragile,"Lasted me 3 weeks. Used at the gym 3-4 times a week. The sound's great, super light weight, and easy to carry in a pocket when folded. However, the wires to each ear are very very thin and fragile. To be called sports headphones, one would think they were more durable. Left earphone lost sound and I threw them out."
2,Broke in less than 2 months,The headphones are light and great for workouts but they break very easily. Not a good choice if you engage in rigorous workouts- I'm still looking for headphones that get the job done right.
2,"Very uncomfortable, decent sound","These have reasonably good sound, however they are very uncomfortable and after about 10 minutes hurt tremendously. Perhaps they are designed for a different size ear than mine! For me, I would not recommend these headphones unless you have a high pain tolerance."
3,They are $15 Headphones,"Probably worse than the headphones that came with my MP3 player in the first place, but they are good for the gym. I can throw them around, run miles, sweat gallons, and who cares...they are $15 headphones. Not the best sound, but they stay put, and maintain their original sound quality while running on a treadmill and being doused in sweat. Don't expect noise dampening, crystal clear highs, or decent bass...you can hear music while you run and not sweat all over you $100+ pair of earbuds...that is why I bought them, and they are perfect for that type of use."
2,Sound quality is very poor,"I have a pair of light weight headphones from Radio Shack (Titanium Pro A35) and I was looking for something a little smaller, lower profile. While these Sony phones are in the same price range, they're NOT in the same realm when it comes to sound quality. I can only describe the sound as ""very muddy"". There's plenty of bass response, but overall they sound like I had cotton in my ears. If you are at all interested phones that will accurately represent your music, try something other than these."
2,Too Fragile,"I concur. They sound fine, but Sony must have intentionally made them easy to snap (I do not presume they hire stupid engineers)."
2,Too Fragile,"I have purchased two of these and both have broken. Others have criticised the fragility of the headband. Believe it, the band it too fragile. They always break at the thin plastic retractable part. I love the sound and the convenience (they fold up to pack easily), but after buying two now, and having no running earphones, I guess I will look for a different product."
1,Good headphones that break!,"When I bought these 'phones I was a little hesitant because other people had problems with them breaking. They seemed fine for 2 months. In fact, they are very good headphones - espcially for running.For months I handled these 'phones like they were eggshells because they look delicate and they have a history of breaking. They broke anyway. I was simply putting them on my head and they broke.Don't buy them. Ante up a few more dollars and get something you won't have to replace. Junk."
3,Just don't last,"I use these headphone for jogging and the sound is fine, but they do fail after just a couple months of use, even when you take very good care of them. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good alternative in a weather-resistant headphone."
4,Good value for the listed price,"i bought this item couple of days ago, the only thing i dont like is the way it hangs on your head and get into your ears which made me uncomfortable, but on the other hand, it gives you a very good sound quality for a very cheap price and once you get used to it, it will become comfortable or at least not annoying."
3,Worked only for 1 year,"The ear phones worked well for the first few months. I used them with my ipod at the gym and also at home when doing chores. After about 7 months, one ear went bad and then the other one also went after about 2 months after that. These headphones are not expensive so if you think that you will want to try something different or upgrade to the state of the art sport headphones after a year, then go ahead and use this."
4,Sony MDR-A35,Purchased 2 and they both broke in half in only a couple of uses. DON'T BUY THESE..YOUR WASTING YOUR $$!!!!
3,Disappointed,"I have several friends who use these headphones and had nothing but positive feedback. The first time I went to use the headphones they cracked in half. I was disappointed to say the least. However, Amazon refunded my payment quickly and without questions. I continue to be a loyal Amazon shopper even though this was one of my few unpleasant purchases."
3,"Decent sound, easy to use, short life.","PROS: Love the folding ability, good enough sound, sweat does not seem affect it. Cheap.CONS: Short lifetime after heavy abuse, even though they are advertised as exercise headphones.FINAL VERDICT: Worth it if you don't mind buying new ones every once in a while.SUMMARY: I have bought these and worked out to them for years. The folding mechanism makes them be able to take more punishment while they are in my gym bag. But the amount of abuse from running on the treadmill will eventually wear out the connections to the speakers, as invariably one of the speakers will start to cut out after heavy use. But they are so cheap I just keep buying new ones, maybe 4 pairs over as many years. I have yet to find a really good pair that can take a beating sound good, AND STAY ON MY HEAD WHILE RUNNING as well as these can. If you find one let me know."
4,Sports Headphones,This are really cool. I got them for my Nano and I don't know how I got along without them. They are great.
2,Love 'em but they break,"They feel great, good sound, but I mostly listen to books on tape/cd. However, the stems break. I've had 4ish so far and when the frames break one is sol. I've glued and wired and taped them, seems to help, looks pretty ugly. Jim"
2,breaks too easily,"I went through two of these very quickly. It's a shame, I wanted to like them. The sound is pretty decent but they are just too fragile. I wore them in the gym and for running out doors. They are very fragile and snap very easily"
2,"Not really a ""sweat guard"" headphone",These headphones lasted about 5 months - one of the sides died and my guess due to sweat. The sound was good yet it isn't any different than the basic Sony headphone; I'll stick to the basic Sony headphones that are $5 cheaper.
5,Awesomesound,The diaphragm is 16mm.The sound and Bass are very very nice...you will hear things that you dont normally hear with this headphone.And it doesnt fall out of your ear...I love it.
3,Break easily,"Very comfortable. I have purchased three pairs because of their comfort and because they travel well and are easy to throw in my gym bag. However, they do break...it takes quite a few wears, but eventually the plastic will snap near the joints. I do expect a lot of wear and tear from my equipment though, because I am so active. If you are less active, they will most likley work very well for you."
2,"Comfortable, but Quite Breakable","I've had 3 pairs of these headphones. They are really comfortable and great for running, but unfortunately they break really easily. The third pair broke right at the joint where they fold when I was just taking them off my head."
2,Aaaaaaggggghhhhhh!!!!,"Just broke my second pair of these headphones! Love the sound, love that they're water-proof (so I can use them at the gym and sweat to my heart's content) and love how they fold up...but I've found out the hard way that they're just not practical for everyday use. The slightest tug and they snap at the folding joints. And I'm obviously not the only one who's had this problem. So frustrating at $20 bucks a pop."
2,Broken in 3 weeks,"I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones. The yellow ones were kind of ""rubbery"" and I've had them for years. These broke within 3 weeks. And not under great stress or high use, either. Just simply taking them off of my head by pulling them apart to get them out of my ear and they broke where the length of the left ear adjusts.Very poor design and cheap plastic. I'll buy other Sony headphones, especially if I can find ones made similar to my older yellow ones. But I will never buy another set of these.Plus: They sound greatCon: They are such poor design that they broke at a really thin place of construction that would get a LOT of pressure from anyone when putting them on or taking them off their head."
2,Sweat guard works; sound & comfort need improvement,"Yes, these headphones are designed well to keep the sweat out of your ears. I bought them to replace the yellow ""Sports"" in-ear phones that came with my old cassete/radio Walkman. With those I had to take them out every once in a while and wipe the sweat off. With these new ones, it's not a problem.However... I'm disappointed with the sound quality. I think it's because the in-ear part is bigger than it used to be - it doesn't go into my ear as far as the older model did. And they hurt! After about half an hour they make my ears hurt so bad that I have to give up on them. The fold-up feature and sweat guard design is not enough to justify the discomfort and lack of sound quality. I would not buy these again and recommend that other shoppers look elsewhere.I'm training for a half-marathon and am still trying to find the perfect pair of traning earphones!!"
4,Good head phones,"I have owed MANY pairs of Sony Sport head phones, mostly because I am hard on them. These actually do a nice job of keeping the sweat out by their design. The sound is decent, but I only use them for working out. I would buy them again."
2,Snap like a twig.,"My second pair broke as easily as the first, despite being extraordinarily careful after the first broke on the same place. They do a better job handling the sweat than others I've used, but are so flimsy they need to be sold as disposables in three packs."
2,Great Idea - Poor Design,"I like the fact that they're designed to keep sweat out. The sound quality is good and they do stay on your head while exercising. The bad part: the design!The foldability is great, but the joint at which the ear piece bends is EXTREMELY fragile. I've broken two pairs already in one month, I will not be buying the fold ups any more. I took the headphones off my head and bam! One side snapped. To buy them at a store costs $20...not for me"
1,Very easily broken,"Like another reviewer, I was pleased with these for a couple of months. They stayed in place while running and were not affected by sweat.But, they recently snapped at a hinge while simply taking them off. I wasn't rough with them or anything. Since they were already broken I played with the other hinges and realized that they all are very fragile and will break with the slightest bending. I'm replacing with another brand -- if you own these I would handle them like they were made of glass."
1,Gone after five months,"I absolutely loved these headphones when I got them. They were comfortable, durable, and had great sound. Unfortunately, after five months the sound in the left headphone went out. This makes them virtually useless. To add insult to injury, they went out during a LONG flight across country. I had to endure the flight with no music. For the money these cost, they are NOT a good value."
1,Used to be good - now brittle and super cheap,I've had the same experience as some of the other reviewers here. I've had 2 pairs break in the EXACT same spot in the last 3 weeks. I will NEVER BUY Sony again. It's hard to believe the quality has declined so badly.
2,Unimpressive,"I bought these to use at the gym. And first, they're not really comfortable in the ears. They felt like they were boring into my ear. And second, they broke after about three weeks. I had them hanging around my neck; went to pull them off and the connecting band snapped. I consider it a waste of $13 and would instead send the money towards better headphones."
3,"Good price, decent sound for $$, shoddy workmanship",I had a pair for a year and the left ear stopped working. I bought a second pair and after two days the plastic by the earpiece snapped!On the plus side the sound and bass are really good for $20 Sony headphones. I'm tempted to buy again but worried about the quality the plastic.
2,Not as good as they used to be,"One ear of these headphones went dead after a month of running. My old Sony sport headphones were excellent and lasted years. I'm not sure what's changed, but it's frustrating to get so little use from a purchase."
2,Flimsy and Uncomfortable,"I have had these for less than 30 days and the hinge just broke. For headphones that are suppose to cater to the sports advocate, you would expect something a bit more durable then to break while using an elliptical machine at a gym.Furthermore, I thought the buds dug into my ear and made wearing them fairly uncomfortable.I am pretty disappointed..."
2,Sweat guard mechanism did not work for me,"I bought these because of all of the positive reviews regarding their ability to stand up to sweat. I was looking for a set of headphones with an over the head band because those ones that have ear loops always shift out of my ears when I run so I can't hear the music well. These headphones really stay in my ears, but I run hard, and I guess the sweat guard cannot stand up to that much sweat. After 30 minutes or so, the pores on the headphones fill with sweat and no sound comes out. I'm disappointed. This does not happen with my ear loop headphones, but again, those don't sound good. Rats."
2,Mine broke within a week,"About 15 years ago, Koss sold a similar design. I still use my Koss phones at work, and bought these for home and workout use. The sound and functionality are fine for the intended use. Trouble is, on the Sonys, the extender band is made of flimsy plastic (Koss used metal), and with the first tug on the cord, it snapped clean through. Portable headphones need to be sturdy, and these are not. This is one of many disappointments with Sony products in recent years. They used to be so good -- what happened? If I'm going to buy a portable product, I need to be able to bang it around a little. Unfortunately, I can find no other manufacturer who makes this design, so if you need them, buy them, but you may need to baby them a little."
3,great while they last,"These were great headphones, until the left side just stopped working!!! I use them daily, and after just 8 months they stopped!! I was really hoping they would prove to be better than some of Sony's cheaper sport headphones, but it seems they all have this problem where the left side just shorts out one day."
2,wind comes through!,"when biking or running fast, the sound of the wind is very loud and drowns out the music, very annoying to have to turn up the volume to have to compensate, also kinda hurts my ears, I would look for a Creative brand one if possible ( plus wire is too thin/ long and gets tangled when running)"
4,iPhone compatible!!! what a nice a surprise!,Not a review. Just wanted to put it out there that these headphones are iPhone compatible.
2,"Good headphones, but not durable","I have bought two pair of these headphones. The sound quality is good and the cord is long and doesn't twist.However, as pointed out by another user, they are NOT durable and ARE prone to breaking near the folding joints. This is NOT user area and they WILL break near the fold if you are not EXTRA CAREFUL in handling them.I may buy my third pair, but will be EXTRA CAREFUL when handling them so they do not break..."
1,agreed with Russell Popkin's review,"these headphones broke at the top hinge, after wearing them only 3 times! and they fit too snug in my ears. i bought these same earphones 6 years ago, and they lasted me 6 years without issue, until they broke earlier this year. i bought the same model as a replacement and found that it's a much tighter fit, AND they're so flimsy! ridiculous. sony - whatever you did to try to 'improve' this model, please go back to the design from 2000."
3,Sweat Guard doesn't work - headphones stay in place,"Does the Sweat Guard feature work? NO. Do the headphones stay in place? Yes, very well.After using theses headphones over 10 times, I've concluded that the Sweat Guard Mechanism does not work. I still have as much sweat dripping into my ears as when I use my regular head phones. If you are like me, tired of sweat dripping into your ears and throwing off your workout, The Sweat Guard feature is one of the main reasons to consider this purchase. Knowing what I know now, I would not buy these again.If you are looking for sturdy headphones that don't shift during a workout, then these work very well. They are flexible and wrap snuggly to your head so they lock into place. If you don't sweat a lot, then I would recommend these headphones."
4,Great for parties,I recieved this as a wedding gift. I have used it for about 5 years. I break it out everytime I have company and it is still just as clear as it was when I got it. The only problem I can think of is that the bottom is real scratched up and looks white.
1,Very interesting topic / very boring text,"For the most part, this book bored me to tears. I did find the stories of the heroes whose selfless devotion to humanity portrayed to be moving and inspiring. These people have (or will have) a special place in Heaven, I am sure. Having lived most of my life among holocaust survivors and their children, I have heard and read alot of stories in several languages. These stories, while moving, I felt were quite boringly presented. I have read other works by Mr. Gilbert, and found this one extremely disappointing because of its literary style, although the content was o.k."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book to learn the motives of those who risked themselves to shelter Jews in WW2 (a valuable subject) but was sadly disapointed. It's as readable (and interesting) as a telephone book.Try Browning, Kuznetsov, Sereny, Rhodes, Hilberg, Wiesenthal, etc"
3,Dated Classic,"""The Modern Corporation and Private Property"" was hailed as an instant classic when it appeared in 1932. To my knowledge, it was the first book to spell out how modern corporate capitalism is characterized by pervasive oligopoly and the separation of management from ownership. These points are still valid today, and remind us that modern capitalism has little in common with the social system analyzed by Adam Smith and other Classical economists. However, most of ""The Modern Corporation and Private Property"" is taken up with an out-of-date, pre-SEC review of corporate finance law as it existed in 1930. As a result, the book will be of little interest to most modern readers, even though it is a ""must"" purchase for any serious library of books on economics or corporate governance."
5,Classic in corporate law,This book has been a classic in legal literature since it was first published. It is amazing how current and up to date it is! If you are studying the inner workings of the corporations this is the book to buy!
5,Wonderful sax,"I first heard ""The New Speakeasy"" tonight when the charming, two-women duo was featured on WNYC-FM here in New York and was immediately taken with their brilliant arrangements of 1920s American and Brazilian music. The music is romantic, and great to listen to if you are a classical OR jazz fan. I'm recommending this CD (and hope there are more to follow!) to all of my friends, and hope you'll give it a listen."
2,The fun lasted only about a week.,"I was initially VERY happy with this clock. It's easy to set, compact, large display, loud alarm and a sensible 8-minute snooze function. However, the light function stopped working after less than a week. I will continue to use the clock but have to turn light on to see the time at night. It's a shame that nobody makes a decent, compact, SILENT running travel alarm anymore. :("
4,Emotionally riveting story,"This is definitely a good read. A lot of true stories tend to be boring. This one, however, will pull you in, it will be hard to put down. The story is told very personably, like the author is there with you telling the story."
1,Wein Peanut Photo Slave,"I tried two of these with a new Vivitar 285HV, and neither one would trigger the flash. My 285HV has a trigger voltage of 4.5 volts, and I read somewhere that the Wein Peanut requires a trigger voltage of 10 or so. It's ironic that Wein makes it sound as if the Peanut were made specifically for the 285."
2,Not for newer Vivitar 285HV,"I tried this product out with a new Vivitar 285HV that I just purchased on Amazon. It is quite unreliable in triggering the flash. I would hit the remote flash ten times and maybe it would fire one or two times. I called and spoke to a customer support representative from the manufacturer, and he said that it doesn't work with the new 285HV because of the low trigger voltage in newer models made within the last two years. I feel it was misleading when I bought the product because it said it would work with the 285HV in the product description. I guess it does, just not the one I bought."
2,Is that all there is?,"I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera for every episode thereafter.Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's ""Shadow Baby"" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts."
3,It didn't knock me over,"Although I enjoyed the book, I did not find it a ""gripping"" read. I thought some of the characters were rather flat - Mokie's family, and those rich, blonde women with their three children that Jane Louise often envied. The only people who possessed any kind of depth were the narrator and her close circle of friends."
2,Not my type of book!,"Too much 'he said' / 'she said', unbelievable characters in unrealistic situations."
4,read read read read,I think that this was a very good book. It kept me wanting to read. I also like how some of Colwins characters were unsure about themselves. That way if you are not sure about your self you could read the book and do what the characters do. i recommend this book to anyperson looking for a great read
3,A meditation rather than a novel,"This novel is a spare, well-written character study of a young, sensitive, cosmically insecure, recently married Manhattanite. Reading this book is a little like listening to the conversations of an articulate and intelligent female friend who shares her interior thoughts and subtle ambivalences about work, family, home, love, and marriage. I found this book enjoyable but it had no compelling story, nor did it leave a lasting imprint in my memory. I sometimes share the books I read with my friends, both male and female. I think that most of my male friends would be quite bored with this book."
2,Light Tan not Brown,"Costume is a lighter tan not brown like Barnery Rubble. When I put it on it matched the color of my light skin and made me look naked. The image on amazon makes the costume look darker than it really is. I give it 2 stars because it actually did fit me. The Extra Large size was perfect for my 6'2"" body but the color was way off. I ended up spray painting it brown to look like like the actual Barney Rubble."
4,Rasta Sex and humour at its sweetest...,"I feel a little guilty admitting this, but it is the humour and the sex that really makes me love this novel. I really love the way the author describes the sex scenes, and the humour that is employed in describing the many antics of the book's main characters. The sex is hot and 'sticky sweet' and the jokes are rampant. Furthermore, the story takes place on the island of Jamaica (where Rastas are from) you just gotta love that!A juicy island-flavoured mix of themes, from reggae music to religion and romance, abound in this novel. If you are one to give in to the odd guilty pleasure, Sugar Cane is as sweet as they come."
5,Historical reference book,J.A. Rogers has struck gold again! This book is another great reference to be used in the search and research of the Black culture.
4,"A Good, Tough Man","It took me a while, but Milan Jakovich grew on me. I love the character. He's a twist on the classic hard-boiled private eye, but with a bit more heart. He's more vulnerable, too, but that doesn't make him soft.I finally got to read a novel all the way through without rolling my eyes at the over-writing, implausible plot or too self-conscious characters. Good stuff, Les. I'll be reading more."
4,"if you enjoy vintage Betty Neals books, you'll like this","An enjoyable story in the ""comfort reading"" category, but if you're looking for a sexy read, you won't get it here. Unlike many Betty Neels stories, in Anne Weale's the couple actually do TALK to each other about their feelings, and their reasons for both marrying and for separate bedrooms seemed believable. Though dated by today's romance book standards, imo it's well worth reading and has led me to look for more books by Weale."
3,Dated,Meh. I probably would have liked it better if I was still twelve. Very dated category romance. It might have been dated even back in 1979 when it came out.Heroine = hysterical virgin with zero career ambitionsHero = smug chauvinist pig
5,Thank Justin Pearson of the Locust,"For printing a re-issue of this fine record on his 31G label. The actual CD case is blood red, adding to the gothiness of this record.It does contain the erratic drumming and spastic singing, but traces of distorted guitar are difficult to find on this record. It is driven mostly on drums, bass, and piano/keyboards. Some of the songs sound like good music to blast when cruising out on Halloween (""Too Bad You're Going to Die""). Others are just weird hardcore-ish spasms that end before you can even figure out what is going on (""Picnic Pants"").It's a remarkable 8-track, 20-some minute record, making the repeat button on your stereo system look quite attractive. Aaron Montaigne became Baron and did a vaudevillainish record with Tarot Bolero and Mac Mann and Ron Avila are in The Get Hustle, so there are more records out by the members to seek out for. This is a great record to place along your collection containing The Birthday Party and Bauhaus."
2,Too Expensive for what you get.,"This program is very difficult to for U.S. users. It uses the international phonetic system vice the American--you have no choice but to learn the international which to me is more difficult. Also, they limit the number of times you can load it onto your computers. I have both the Pronunciation Power 1 & 2 (very expensive)and now they won't allow me to download them--they say I've loaded them too many times. How can this be when many of us purchase new computers every 3 or 4 years? Also, using the dictionary to look up a word is very very slow. For example, if you are looking up a word such as women, you have to go thru all the w's until you finally reach the ""wo's"" for women. Besides all this, it is too expensive for what you get and the limitations they put on it. There are better, less expensive programs."
4,A nice inexpensive way to protect your trunck/cargo area,"I was looking for something inexpensive to protect the back of my wife's small SUV (BMW X3) and this one did the trick. You can easily pull it out and wash it down with your garden hose. I didn't want to spend $80+ for a form fitting model. For $20 this one seemed to be the best deal. Lightweight, flexible rubber/plastic. I would recommend this product."
2,Inexpensive but inaccurate,"This was shipped so that it arrived out of shape. The dimensions were wrong: the product measures 27"" x 33"" x 2.75"" approximately. The material is very slick and would not work to keep items sliding around if that is your goal. It was very inexpensive compared to other products, now I know why."
2,confused,"I just opened it today, and I am disappointed. The outside of the box states it is a floor cover and not the trunk tray as written on the shipping label. I really don't know if they shipped the wrong item.It is supposed to be 28"" by 3ft. It is not.So, I am not sure if I got the correct item and I don't want to have to pay to ship it back. It is pretty bent, I am hoping it straightens out. A friend of mine just bought a new Sante Fe and admired my cargo tray so I bought her one. It is not as thick as the one I have."
4,Definitely worth the money,"The only thing I would change on this mat is the height of the lip because it is something you have to deal with when putting heavy items in the truck. On the other hand, it definitely keeps spills contained. At only $20, however, this mat is worth every penny. If you investigate the cost of similar items elsewhere, you know exactly what I mean. I would definitely buy this again."
5,Johnnie Blue Review,"Surprisingly good plot. Thought I could predict it, but the shocking end threw me in a loop. Characters and situations could be realistic like true crime and conspiracy; sometimes I forgot I was reading fiction. Certain parts very stimulating. Nicely written and easy to read. Highly recommended. Irrevelent note: author is extremely handsome from photo."
3,important ideas expressed too angrily,"I read Geller's book with interest and found many of her ideas significant, accurate, and downright common-sensical.Her central argument is that American society has become wedding-obessessed without deeply analyzing the problems inherent in the institution of marriage. She insightfully points out that while the wedding industry booms and women of all ages seem to be embracing a kind of Cinderella attitude toward their weddings, never has the divorce rate been higher in the U.S.This is a message of enormous importance, it seems to me. Unfortunately, however, Geller weakens her own credibility by delivering her ideas in a tone of tremendous personal anger, frustration, and bitterness. This emotionalism detracts from her ability to deliver a clear-headed, reasonably-argued, persuasive point. This is a shame because Geller's ideas do deserve to be heard."
3,"And I found this book next to ""Martha Stewart Weddings""?","A bride-to-be myself, I picked up ""Here Comes the Bride"" while looking at wedding guides in a bookstore. It definitely should have been in the Women's Studies section.I'd be lying if I said I didn't find this book imensely interesting. And I did buy it expecting to read a critique on the marriage industry in the U.S. But I was not prepared for how anti-marriage Geller is.This book is half dissection and half rant. Perhaps if she had stuck to dissecting, the book would be easier to stomach--not to mention easier to follow. Examination of the wedding dress turns into a 10 page list of reasons why any woman has to be insane to walk down the aile.My fiance has spent the last week harboring fears of me calling off the wedding after skimming through this book. But I will say this, anyone who still wants to get married after reading Geller's attempts at brainwashing is probably getting married for the right reasons."
3,I still hope to get married...,I think Geller makes a good point with the role that women play and the commercialization of marriage. However she seems to present interesting facts on the history of marriage and the cultural role of marriage. But she then jumps to the argument that marriage and weddings are not a healthy thing for women and society?? What about a marriage based in equality and respect? What about a prenup?? What about having a wedding where you do not have to pay as much??I think that this is a fascinating book to read being interested in the cultural issues of marriage and courtship. However I find her arguments a little unsettling. I still recommend this book to people who seem to get all caught up in the marriage culture so that they have a chance to get another perspective.I would reccomend the book Pink THink for this audience
1,Junk!,"I bought this item because I liked the 6-1/2"" depth of the box, and competitors only offer the standard 4"". The box itself was well built, but the lock was complete junk. It is loose and flops about freely when unlocked. You can almost pull the lock out of the hole. The lock is threaded, and the picture shows it has a nut to hold it in place, but there was no nut on it. Given the design, I don't think I could fit a nut on now even if I had one. I don't want the hassle or expense of returning this item, so will go to the hardware to see what I can come up with to make it work. I am not impressed, and will never buy another product from this manufacturer."
1,The sound is terrible.,"We really tried to watch this but the sound was so bad, it couldn't be understood at all."
1,Extremely inconvenient & horrible!!!,"I had no problem getting songs on this player. Just used drag & drop in Windows Explorer. I never even installed the software they included. It even shows the extra memory as a separate drive, so it was no problem to divide the music up.My problems with this...#1 In Mp3 mode, it eats up the battery fast. I go through a battery in one day. Gets expensive fast.#2 The battery will show 2/3 charge left, but the player will just stop. It won't restart without a new battery.#3 The main button to go forward, back, change radio stations etc is extremely unresponsive. You have to hit the button 2 or more times to get it to do what you want. Try doing this on a treadmill!I wasted over $100 on this and am now looking at other, better MP3 players. Don't waste your money."
4,Just One annoying problem.,"I have read the online manual, but I am still having problems deleting files from one of the drives. The files keeps reappearing after I have erased the files. In addition, after deleting it from the player, once played back, it reappears again. Any suggestions out there. Otherwise, there are no other problems and the sound is wonderful!"
1,Not so good....,"The button in the middle annoys me. In order to use the back (or up) button, you must push it in just the right spot. It takes me, on average, about three or four tries to get that button to do what I want it to do. It either pauses the song or goes back a few seconds when all I want it to do is go back to the beginning of the song! So annoying.<br /><br />I'm taking my product back to Target today to get a refund. It was overpriced anyway."
3,mp3 player,"this product is my first mp3 player and i'd have to say that over all im pretty content. getting started with it was pretty hard. it was confusing on how exactly to get the files i downloaded onto my mp3 player. after a few hours i finally got it. and then it was stuck on the &amp;quot;music&amp;quot; screen and then it would just shut off. eventually it worked (dont ask me how).i would also have to say that the keypad is pretty difficult to control. the slighest touch will hit the other button. also, there is NO off button. so yeah...idk if you are really good with electronics then i'd say this is a great product,i thought i was until now... good luck"
1,I do not like this one at all,"I had this music player before, and I have to admit, it's pathetic. The ""256MB"" it supposedly has on the player is only 128MB. The reason I do not like it is because it had erased all of my music when I didn't even do anything to it."
4,THROW UP YOUR J'S,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE EXCEPT FOR THE ENDING. IF ANYONE UNDERSTANDS THE ENDING LEAVE ME A COMMENT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT I LIKE THE MOVIE. ITS IS A LOW BUDGET MOVIE, SO IF YOU DONT LIKE LOW BUDGET MOVIES DONT GET THIS. THE JACK SQUAD DID THERE THANG . THROW YOUR J'S UP AND LETS GET THIS MONEY!"
4,I wish I had read this earlier,"A late start reading anything other than THe Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings prevented me from enjoying this when I was younger. This delightful story of a little dog's encounter with a grumpy wizard introduces us to the vageries of the ""mystics"". From the moon to under the sea to land, with a surprise ending, Roverandom experiences many things that make him glad to be a dog with his human friend. A fine read."
3,"Roverandom is short, cute, and fluffy","Roverandom is a sweet little book which would probably be best used as a read-aloud introduction to Tolkien for small children. It is neither profound, nor a masterpiece, but it is fun to read. It is the story of a puppy that is turned into a toy dog by a passing wizard, and his adventures as he tries to get back to real-dog-ness. This edition has extensive endnotes, almost to the point of being silly (they explain a reference to Humpty Dumpty!). But the endnotes are otherwise helpful and entertaining if you are curious about the current event allusions in the text. All in all, it is an entertaining book, and worth sharing with a young friend."
4,NOT just for 'Tolkien completists',"Don't think that this is a book only for hardcore Tolkien fans, like The Lost Tales or whatever. In fact, some of the hardcore fans--the kind that dress up like elves and things like that--probably won't even like it. It's a silly little story about a small dog who bites a wizard on the behind and gets turned into a toy, and then goes on to have a number of adventures on the moon and under the sea. What I liked about the book is its wonderful freedom from the strictest constraints of plot, and Tolkien's whimsical willingness to throw whatever takes his fancy--like the musical plants one finds on the moon. But the story still flows for all that, and it's mostly quite coherent and wholly fun to read. More than once, even!"
5,A charming story. . .,". . .written by a loving father to console a weeping boy.On a seaside holiday with his family, Tolkien's 2nd child lost his toy dog on the beach. After hours of searching, it became clear that the toy was gone for good. Ever the master storyteller, Tolkien fashioned a tale about a little dog which annoys a magician and is turned into a toy and experiences all sorts of adventures under the sea and on the moon before being returned to his natural state and to his owner.Lovers of Tolkien have long known of the existence of this manuscript and it is a joy to see it finally in print.Wonderful for children of all ages. Highly recommended."
4,Cute and charming,"Roverandom is a flight of fancy written for Tolkien's children over several years as an explanation of what happened to his son's little lost toy dog. It is extremely light and silly, and generally good fun. Little Rover, a real dog turned into a toy, gets into various scrapes, lives with the Man in the Moon (and the Dog in the Moon) for a bit, and meets a whole lot of people with very silly names.To get a feel for the style, it's really a lot more like the Father Christmas Letters than the Hobbit, and is full of Tolkien's scetches and paintings."
5,3M Mask,"Due to severe allergy conditions currently, my wife is wearing this mask around the clock. We can say with the mask and medications she has been stable and out of the hospital. Grateful for this product"
1,What a waste of money and time! Don't buy it!,This is a total waste of time and money. It's the most superficial and useless video I have ever seen. I threw it in the trash.
2,Enought is enought,"I will have to admit that I loved Dirk Pitt and Al Gordino in the first Dirk Pitt novel; however, there can only be so many items sunken in the water which could enable evil characters to take over the world. Once you have read one Dirk Pitt novel, you have read them all."
1,Atlantis Found,"I had eagerly been waiting for this book for quite some time, but after I read it, I was really disappointed. I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, and this is the worst one I've read so far. There wasn't any of the magic or fun that I've come to expect in the books, nor the passion. It's almost like Cussler couldn't quite make up his mind in what direction he wanted to go, and in the end, he went in too many different directions."
1,"Speak the lines, I pray you . . .","Fascinating story, BUT, good Lord--the dialogue! Clusser is in desperate need of a partner to handle the dialogue; people do not talk like that, and I cringe/am disappointed anew every time his characters open their mouths."
2,Won't read another,This is the first and last Clive Cussler book I will read. Interesting premise...poorly written. He's a master of the extended metaphor and run on sentence. I prefer better written stories. Try some Crichton instead...this is a typical guy book in the same way there are typical gothic romances.
1,Not fit for wiping one's behind.,"Congratulations Clive Cussler. You read ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" by Graham Hancock. You thought to yourself it would make a great piece of fiction. And you managed to comletely screw it up!I had never read Clive Cussler before, and I never will again. First of all, the dialogue was utter nonsense. No one speaks like these characters. Also, why in the world does the author insist on describing in detail every piece of machinery, or gadget that Dirk Pitt (and what a stupid name!) or his enemies are using? This is inane. Is Clive Cussler getting kick backs from all of the brand names that he mentions in his books? Everything about this book can be summed up in one little 5 letter word.Silly.If you respect your intelligence, stay away from this one! I would have given no stars if it was possible."
5,Intriguing,"This was my first Clive Cussler book. I didn't realize that I was jumping into the 15th or 16th book in the series. I can't wait to go back and read the previous ones. This book combines ancient history and adventure, as well as politics and the military, in an effort to provide a first-rate novel. The character development that went into this book and the series is phenomenal and is second only to the creative storyline that keeps you guessing until the end. If you like me are a fan of paperback novels packed with action and adventure this series is for you."
3,The Usual Cussler Stuff,"I've read a number of Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures and my general reaction is that his earlier ones tend to be better than the later ones.The plots of ALL of his books are pretty fantastic (i.e. unbelievable) but the earlier ones are more attentively written. By the time you get to ATLANTIS FOUND, you pretty much know Cussler's tried and tested format: 1. Something weird happens somewhere; 2. Dirk and Al get involved in it; 3. On the way, Dirk meets and beds a smart, pretty woman who is somehow involved with the weirdness Dirk and Al are solving (poor old Al never seems to get the girl); 4. Many cool gadgets and cars later, problem solved, Dirk gets to save the world and celebrate over a glass of vintage tequila.ATLANTIS FOUND contains some really shoddy writing and some creaky and predictable dialogue, but for pure macho escapism, it's good fun."
3,Cussler's moving into Bear territory,"I would love to give this book a full five stars just for the unbounded creativity of the story; this ain't literature, folks, this is pure fun. And, this is pure SF. I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, but this one is really over the top. He's thrown caution to the winds, given his characters the most utterly humanly impossible odds, and of course they always win. Not realistic by a long shot, but who cares? This is good stuff, truly enjoyable to those who like SF, adventure, hi-tech, or thrillers. Oh, yeah, why only three stars if I like it so much? Well, the similes and metaphors can be pretty bad, the dialogue is silly and unreal, and the prose just adequate. But then again, this ain't literature, is it? Just a terrifc story. Go for it."
2,Pretty bad,"Well, not even pretty. It starts off with an interesting angle, but thereafter goes rapidly downhill and the ability to suspend disbelief disappears completely after about the half-way mark. However, I bravely stuck it out to the end, and it just became steadily more ludicrous, the characters more and more cardboard cutouts, the successful adventures against hopeless odds ever more absurd. The paperback cost me SFr10 (about $US6) where it was being sold off presumably in an attempt to move it. I paid too much."
2,Good book - BAD tape,"I am a big fan of Clive Cussler, and have read all his books. I read Atlantis Found and really enjoyed it. Just recently I bought the book on tape (read by Michael Prichard), for my husband to listen to. He is not a fiction reader, but we listened to Harry Potter with our kids and became addicted to listening to the tapes while driving. Well, the narrator of Atlantis Found was just terrible. He read in monotones, and brought little excitement to the story. Each character sounded the same, except the females and he read them sounding really silly! My husband did enjoy the plot, but we will not listen to Michael Prichard reading a Clive Cussler book again. Mr Prichard should take notes from the Harry Potter narrator (Jim Dale), who was outstanding."
1,Grow Up,"I can't believe I keep reading this dribble. The stories are fair, but the characters seem to keep getting more moronic. I can't figure out who is older - the cliches or the characters (who seem to be going through a neverending mid life crisis). This is the last Clive Cussler book I buy. My suggestion is to get this one at the library and spend your money on good books."
5,Clive's second best book,"Atlantis found is superb! So good to see Dirk Pitt back in full form, running all over the world with Al... it seems that in each chapter they somehow escape death and danger. It's all so well presented, so believable and a real adventure-packed page turner. Second to only ""Sahara""... this book gets major high marks."
2,Anyone know an assassin for hire?,"Mr Cussler is starting to believe his own hype and has moved away from fast moving stories into self indulgence with tired and predictable characters.By the end of this, I am afraid I was with the bad guys and was hoping for Pitt's early death.Avoid."
4,"Great book, but the worst reading I've ever experienced","I love Cussler's books, and was ecstatic to see an unabridged tape. I have to say, however, that this was the first tape (of dozens) I have listened to where the reader was so awful I could hardly stand to listen. Mr. Cussler, PLEASE find someone else. Listen to how this guy massacred your story. Did you have a computer scan it and sound out the words? It sure sounded like it. I have come to enjoy tapes more than books, but not in this case. BE WARNED, this particular tape is not worth the money. Read the book instead."
2,"If you enjoy 1940s comic books, this is the one for you!","what the heck, even if I give it only two stars for poor writing, lame charectors, and contrived situations, it is fun in the same way those old Captain America and Bucky cartoons were. I mean, this book has it all...Evil Nazi clones! Jackbooted goons all in black riding SnoCats (as seen on TV in the Man from Uncle)! Loneghrin's Spear (aka the Holy Lance, per Cussler ""the holiest relic in Christianity!?!)! .... Butwait, there's more! You can have a bundle of fun laughing at Cussler's grasp of science and history. I always thought Star Trek was the low point of pop science, but no longer, Clive has taken the nadir for himself. .... And the history is even sillier. Cussler has a historian say ""it's a fact that the more advanced a civilization, the less they leave behind them"". Huh? That makes no sense whatsoever. ...."
2,Oh my,"This is the first Clive Clusser book I've read; I selected it because people told me that anthropologists/archaeologists are main characters and I'm an archaeologist. Oh lord, I got my first huge chuckle from mammoths freezing solid where they stood (in preface or intro) and continued laughing from there. Not sure what is funnier: Atlantians colonized Antartica, the Forth Richt (as in Nazi's were the Third Richt, not sure how to spell 'richt""), the so-called archaeologist acting like a hired killer/adventurer, or the author writing himself into the novel-on Antarctica of all places. Read this book only if you want a good laugh and have much freetime, its long with tiny print."
2,Great story - pity about the style,"The aim of any fiction writer is to get the reader to suspend belief. My ability to do this was greatly impaired by Cussler's writing. His characters are hardly even one-dimesional, his grammar is no better than a schoolchild, and his dialog is, frankly, dreadful.In the book's favor, the storyline is strong and well thought out. That didn't, however, outweigh the many, many faults."
4,If you don't like this book...,"then you're just plain crazy...or snobbish? Look, if you're looking for well written deep character driven plots that reveal something about the human condition, you're in the wrong place. But if you're looking for an entertaining, fun, exciting ""page turner,"" this is your book. Cussler has his faults (I, too, had to physically resist rolling my eyes when he turns out to be the minor character ""Dad""), but he's certainly far better than his peers of the same genre like the once decent but now insufferable Tom Clancy, Michael ""Master of Banality"" Crichton or the absolutely horrid Grisham."
3,Whats wrong with the old Dirk Pitt,"I have read every Clive Cussler NUMA, Dirk Pitt book that has come out. The last one, ""Inca Gold"" was maybe one of the best. When I got my copy of Atlantis Found, which was bought by my daughter, I was in Pitt heaven. It was a signed copy by Clive himself. The first and major problem is that it has become NUMA goes Star Wars. Flying cars???? Whats wrong with the old Dirk? I still love reading about guys from NUMA and I get so involved I forget all about Clive Cussler and just call it the Dirk Pitt author. I haven't finished the book yet and I am enjoying it. Maybe Clive can invent a time machine and Dirk can go back to the 20th century, or how about back to a time like the revolution. Old Dirk is OK with me."
4,you gotta be loyal to love it,"True, the readers who are used to Crichton's over-the-head scientific ""facts"", and Grisham's law babble might find a lot of flaws with Cussler's writing, but for a Dirk Pitt fan, or anyone who has an imagination and wants to just forget his/herself for a while, this book is a lot of fun. If you still have problems with the book, my suggestion is to read a couple of the older ones (Deep Six, Treasure) till you find within yourself a devotion to Dirk Pitt and the crew. Then you might see the light. To Mr. Cussler: Don't let this one set you back! Keep writing them, and I'll keep buying them!"
1,Fifth grade reading level,"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read, and looking at the reviews, it seems as though maybe I should give him another chance.I actually liked the plot and ideas behind Atlantis Found, however, I had a hard time getting ""lost"" in the book, as I love to do, because of the grade school level of writing! Also, I found the Pitt character to be such a cliche of a hero that I was hoping the bad guys would win just so there would be some sort of surprise.Even though I've given it only one star, I would recommend this book in one instance - as an assignment for someone learning English. The plot is interesting enough for an adult, while the English is simple enough for an intermediate learner to follow along. If I was still teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) I would definitely use this book in my class."
2,"Starts Great, but not typically good Cussler ending","I have always enjoyed Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. But, Atlantis Found disappointed me. The novel starts off in typical Cussler fashion, with a great premise, good background facts, and typical Dirk Pitt adventure. But, then, the climax and ending trail off, in an incomplete and unresolved manner. For example, Cussler tells us that there is a spy at NUMA (possibly Admiral Sandecker's secretary, Julie Wolff?), but there is no follow-up, and we never find out who it is. The significance of the magnificent obsedian skulls is never explained. The clues regarding the Nazi connection are thrown together in an uncharacteristically sloppy way. I was disappointed because Cussler is capable of better organization. I hope the next one is better (I'm sure it will be)."
4,Atlantis Found,"This was the first Dirk Pitt novel i've read, and I found it to be a great book. It was filled with action and adventure. I seemed to not be able to put this book down until i finished it. My only complaint was that there was too much detail about brands of items in the story, I don't think anyone honestly cares why Dirk chose to use one brand of scuba tank over another. All in all, it was a fantastic story."
1,Worst book I have read - ever.,"This book was a great disappointment. The story line is completely rediculous. I only finished reading it, because I wanted to know if it would get any better, but alas it didn't. I use this book as an example for a bad book, if somebody asks me.plot - I guess Dirk is a superhero, he dodges every attack story line - can it get any more stereotyped?Never Clive for me again."
1,500 pages too long,"Who is this guy's editor? I'd like to have a talk with him. Atlantis Found would be a great book, if only someone else had written it. Or if someone had, you know, proofread. I have to give Cussler credit for having good intentions and ideas, but his characters are more like caricatures (when they're given any sort of distinction at all), the dialogue is horrendous, and his tendency to write himself into the plot is a bit tacky. I also found it a bit disconcerting to find every boat, plane, cycle and piece of gear Pitt was toting described by brand and model...is Cussler picking up endorsement money somewhere? In spite of what most of the fan reviews are saying, Dirk Pitt has none of Bond's panache, and I can't understand comparing the two.Good science fiction makes the impossible believable. Atlantis Found even makes what little hard science it contains hard to swallow."
3,atlantis found error,"I was amazed to read of the educational institute of one of the characters to be Saint Andrews College, Scotland. As a graduate of St. Andrews University (note St. NOT Saint) I can assure Mr. Cussler that The University consists of several colleges ( St. Marys and St. Salvators, to mention two). This is a distraction in the usually accurate writing and research of this accomplished author. Do your homework a little better next time!"
4,Good Fun - Easy Readinig,"I am a big Tom Clancy fan and this was my first Clive Cussler. Clancy's stories are excellent, but they get me lost as well. Clive Cussler stuck to the point and didn't go off and use unfamiliar terms. The reading was very fluid and relaxing. The only thing that I felt was wrong with it was that I felt as if I were watching a movie. I never really got to know the characters. After I was finished, I left before the credits were done. I also found myself not believing how Pitt got out of some of the situations that he was in. I thought it was a good touch to include himself in the novell (Cussler). Another weekness I found is how did all the archeology and the comet relate, when at the end, the plot was totally different. It seemed to me that to throw Pitt off and searching for these artifacts, was a waste of a couple of hundred of pages."
5,Atlantis Found,"I am not a great fan of fiction novels. My new husband (3 months) goaded me into reading this novel and told me it would be fun and a great escape. Well, he was 100% correct. This is a terrific book, riveting and a wonderful way to relax. Thank you Clive Cussler."
3,I'm an old Dirk Pitt fan from the 80's and 90's and this just doesn't do it.,"Unlike many of the assumptions here, I am a female, age 58. I never felt these were 'guy books'.This one was just ok. There were many tedious descriptions that were truly unnecessary - they didn't contribute to the plot or the story or were commonly known already. When it would have benefitted the story for MORE descriptions, there were none (i.e. better descriptions of the mummy's they found). It felt to me that Mr. Cussler had to produce x number of pages and was just filling space.I plowed away to the end of the book. I gave it three stars only because I like the characters. The read was not an easy one as most Pitt novels were."
3,A tlantis Found,"It was a good novel , but it did not have the suspense grip that one expects in Clive Cussler,s novels."
4,Most Intiguing,This is one of the most intriguing novels of Cusslers.It keeps the reader interested and although the heros always seem to have the upper hand this amazing adventure screams along its treacherous path to a predictable but exciting conclusion.
1,Dragged kicking and screaming to Atlantis,"Why did I finish this book? It took sheer willpower and a niggling hope that a great plot twist would make it all worthwhile. Tedious and unnecessary descriptions were thrown into the mix. For example, Dirk would be scrambling over a mountainside with vast hordes in pursuit and Cussler would pause to describe, in excruciating detail, the shirt and pants being worn by our hero. Well, it wasn't as strange as all that, but it seemed that many paragraphs were throwaways and did little to move the story along. What was the deal with the gourmet meal of rabbit and sweetbreads situated in the midst of all the mayhem? It sure brought everything to a screaching halt. I think ""Dad"" should learn to write more better."
5,Another great job,"I have read every Clive Cussler book published and think this is one of his best. I enjoy how he brings background information into his story and shares this with the reader.The theory of Atlantis is fascinating and I'm glad he finally chose to write about it.As always, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano are great partners! It seems a little twist is added as Al is finally getting married...could Dirk be next?All in all, I couldn't put it down until the last page was read. Can't wait for the next book!"
1,Uninspired Drivel,"I'm not a picky reader, nor do I routinely bash far-fetched pulp fiction. However, it seems that after 20 years of Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler wrote this book solely for money. The characters are cliched card-board cutouts with ZERO character development. And it seemed that nearly every character had cold blue eyes with bodies that Mr. and Ms. Universe would envy.But the biggest complaint I have, is the book read like the author was just punching out the words as fast as he could, and then running off to play golf. I like to read through books in one session, but this took me five or six.On the posotive side, the ending action sequence was neat. Lets just hope he ends the series mercifully, and not have it end up like the comic series Penuts..."
4,Working Formula,"Clive Cussler has once again written a novel based on his successful formula that has worked again and again. With the starting grand entrance of Pitt to the predictable ending of Pitt saving the human race. (Yes, Again.)What makes this book highly interesting is Cussler's theory on the people of 'Atlantis', what happened to them, and the legacy that was left behind. Cussler was able to tie in the crash of a comet, the disappearance of Atlantis, a vehicle built by Adm. Byrd, and the rise of the Fourth Empire (Reich).The ending by Cussler leaves the book open for sequels, with the start of a new NUMA book, (serpent) and the hints given in the book, one wonders if this might be the last of the Pitt novels. Overall, the book is predictable as a James Bond movie. The bad dudes gets what they deserves, hero gets a few scraps and bruises, but saves the world and gets the girl. But the theories and knowledge of the ocean and historical tie-ins are worth the time invested in this book."
5,One of his best,"OK let's face it -- no one reads a Cussler book for the highbrow prose. He has GREAT plots. And this one is original for the way it combines two old plotlines (Atlantis and the Nazis) into an original story. It's well-researched, I might add. And personally I'm THRILLED that he ditched the co-author from the last book and wrote this one himself. Something about Cussler's writing grabs you from the first minute -- who wants poetic writing in an action adventure for Pete's sake? From the discovery of the skull in Colorado to the ultimate discovery in Antartica, this book is a thrill a minute. Who cares that Dirk and Al have been blown up more times than any of us can count? We all secretly want to be Dirk Pitt (and I'm a woman saying this!) surviving with aplomb and humor and worst anyone can hurl at us. Well worth your reading time."
3,Good Plot,"This Dirk Pitt novel involves a missing ship that reappears 56-years after it was considered dead. Pitt is lead to an ancient mystery with a diabolical enemy--but he is up to the task. Good, light read."
3,"same old, same old","I read Cussler a lot. THis is the same old formula used for the 15th time. The formula goes like this: an ancient event that will have consequences in the future, undetroyable Pitt appearing by page forty or fifty ( in mass market paperback ). Then the rest of his pals ( GIordino, Rudi Gunn 0 appearing subsequently, an enemy as bad as Satan himself, the old romance with congresswomen Loren Smith, admiral James SAndecker, etc, etc. COnclusion: it's good."
2,"Interesting theory, but really !","this novel caught my eye due to the inspiring title including the word 'Atlantis' and hence i thought that the book might be of some good thing substance. yet it was not, although the underlying theory was interesting and provide some mild contenment for somebody interested in the subject. it was in a way very similar to previous factual books by the likes of George Hancock and Charles Hapgood discussing the possibilty of Atlantis being discovered under Antartica. the incredulous character of Dirk Pitt does nothing more for the book than the manner in which it was written. an involving plot seemed to be the only bonus from the novel that was ultimately a James Bond story told in a slightly more interlectual way."
4,Excellent Dirk Pit Adventure,"I have read all of the Dirk Pit novels and enjoy them. Sure they are fanciful and follow a standard formula. Like Dean Koontz novels do. However, when it comes to an entertaining read, I will always look forward to the next Clive Cussler novel about NUMA."
3,"Found it to be a little disappointing, but enjoyable to read","I felt it certainly wasn't in the leage with some of his other novels, but as a huge fan of Mr. Cussler's work I read everything he puts out. Found this book tedious in places, especially the dialogue between him and Al Giordino, people don't really talk that ""stiff"" to each other. Also found the book in spots to be an advertisement for scuba gear, dive watches, etc...constantly telling us the brand names, apparently for each mention Mr. Cussler gets monetary reward. Again an enjoyable book, but though it lacked a lot of intensity. But as a loyal fan, I eagerly await the next Dirk Pitt adventure."
2,Formula For Success,"I am a big Dirk Pitt fan, having read all of the books (mostmore than once). Atlantis Found, though, is a stinker. The plot istrite (Hitler's children; sappy romance with the Congresswoman) andfilled with flaws. Did Clive Cussler really write this one (on automatic pilot), or did one of his proteges just follow the formula?"
1,Just Plain Awful,"This is my first Clive Cussler read, and it is my last. A suspenseful prologue aside, this book is awash in shallow main characters, silly plot twists, and inane dialogue. Add a doomsday plot so implausible that it would make Ian Flemming blush. The dialogue between Dirk and friends seems to have been copied from some bad cop show, with tasteless, cliched, campy similes by the dozen. I happened to read this book in the audio form, which also had an awful narrator. Save your time and sense of self-worth, and read something by Clancy, Ludlum, or perhaps as one other reviewer suggested, the excellent novels of Patrick Obrien."
5,Pitt at his best,I love Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. This one is probably his best. It is exciting and so different that a book this long took me 3 days to read. I could not put it down. If you have any interest in the mythn of Atlantis you would want to read this.
5,review of clive cussler best book,clive cusslers book was one of the best books I've ever read. i say this because it was very detailed. also it some comedy but ALOT of action. i rarley find a book that i love as much as atlantis found. so far its my number one book =)
5,How Much is too much?,"I started reading Cussler's work after the release of Sahara in theatres, as a lot of people probably did. I found myself hooked on what Dirk and Al would do next. So much so I started to read all of his works in chronological order. I thought I would burn out but every book has a different twist and a new treasure. I was pretty excited when Atlantis Found arrived because I had no idea how Cussler would handle the mythical continent of Atlantis. True to form, he didn't dissappoint! Although this is my 20th or so book, I enjoyed Atlantis Found as much as I enjoyed Pacific Vortex!"
2,"""If you dont have anything nice to say...""","Alright, I'll admit that Clive Cussler has been, and always will be, a ""popular fiction"" writer, i.e. books that dont require thought. But his past books were NEVER this bad! I actually enjoyed his early novels, but Cussler's writing has become nothing but shoddy junk. Atlantis found is shallow and cliche. The only highlight I can find is that it isn't (thank god) tedious. But what bothered me the most was his need to explain things such as Precession, Diffusion (in relation to the populating of North America), and even sky charts (among many other things) for goodness sakes! I understand some people may not have ever heard of, say, the Theory of Diffusion, but they are capable of looking it up! Cussler need not badly attempt to work the definition into the story!! Ugh. Nothing bothered me more than that."
1,Just bad.,"Badly written, cliched characters, dumb plot. Lines like ""mudslides that were almost 30 feet wide or more."" (What's almost more?) Everybody has ""white teeth"" in this book. It's filled with the model numbers of the machines, but it lacks any development of the people. This is Judith Krantz with fighting instead of shopping. It's bad.What's more, the reader has little intonation and his voice grates. It's just bad."
1,"Zzzzzzz Oh sorry, was I writing a review?","I am about half way through this book and I just can't finish it. Its not usual I do that but it is just sucking my will to live.The dialogue is a joke. I can't stand the main character. I'm mostly just hoping that between dodging 'killers' and bombs, he gets wacked in the process.It seems every paragraph is just filled with the make and model of every piece of gear he has on. Do I care that he looked down at his x3-500 Supermega watch with intel microprogramming digitalizers? No. And no one else does either.Sorry but I just dont think I can finish it."
1,What am I missing?,"Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because I have not read any of Cussler's other works, but I must say that I was severely dissappointed in this book. I finally gave up trying to be interested about half way through, and that is extremely rare for me. Considering the rave reviews I read, I tried hard to let this book win me over, but all I can tell you is I wont be reading any more from this author."
1,I have actually READ this book!,"OK, can someone tell me why the average rating of this book is 4 stars! @$ I have been totally misled. It's so childishly predicatble, like a bad Hollywood action movie. Alright, the story line could be a PASS. But, my goodness, a flat lacking of narritive skills. It's my first time reading Clive Cussler and LAST. It's for kids age 8-10 only."
4,Dirk & Al have done it again...saved the world!,Reading about Dirk Pitt is like eating popcorn...you just can't stop. Some say that Cussler is not as good as the past but I say he is the same...fun...far out...full of adventure...and nine or ten? lives. This book was a little long but very typical of Cussler books. I still don't know who the leak was in NUMA maybe someone can help with that!
5,Atlantis Found,"Mr. Clussler never fails to entertain me. This one is no exception. The thrills keep coming. Dirk Pitt is a great hero. And the messes he and Al get into and out of are just plain fun. With the added bonus of the historial information that Mr. Clussler packs into his books is first rate. Mr. Clussler does a lot of research to get his facts right which makes his books even more fun. I look forward to another book by Mr. Clussler, soon I hope."
3,Cussler Trips over himself,"Cussler is back and the action sequences are well written, but the plot suffers a little bit from the many different aspects of the plot. Well written but the story could have been simpler."
4,Dirk and Clive are Back,"I bought this book as soon as it came out even though I had been disappointed with both Flood Tide and Shock Wave. Being a huge fan of Mr. Cussler's I had to give Dirk, Al and the NUMA crew another chance, and I am really glad that I did. Mr. Cussler weaves a great story which makes the reader keep reading page after page, not wanting the book to end. Buy it and if you haven't read his other books, buy them too."
4,Never a dull moment in a Cussler novel!,"Cussler fans will find his latest very like his previous novels. I'm more of a reader of historical fiction like ""Cold Mountain"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory"", but I always make it a point to read Cussler's books when they are published. They always entertain, they are never too deep, in brief, they are like a roller coaster ride, packed with thrills and adrenaline but not exactly profundly moving."
1,dashrom,"Who edited this story? Dialogue was out of place, events contradicted themselves. Are we in too big a hurry to make a dollar? I want the job of editing the next attempt but it seems Dirk and Al are about to be turned out to pasture with their love interests. Does this mean we have to endure those two characters that surfaced two years ago in Cussler's collaboration with what's-his-name?"
5,The Grandmaster Delivers in Spades!,I picked this book up and could not put it down! What a blend of myth and adventure. Pairing our beloved Dirk and Atlantis was a stroke of pure genius. In the opening adventure sequence I found myself holding my breath just like the unfortunate three in the chamber. Only Dirk could make an entrance like that.Our favorite characters are all back and we realise how much we missed them. Al gets a girl of his own and Loren realises she might be missing something.The great classic car is a dream. Wouldn't we all love the chance to be behind the wheel?The bad guys are guys and girls that we really can hate with a vengence. The incredible odds just keep coming at our heroes and they never give up!All in all just what a Cussler book should be!
2,"Like a horse with a broken leg, I had to put it down.","This was my first Cussler novel. I had heard such great things about his books but I was sorely disappointed. Sure, the action was great. I love good action. However, the characters were so waaaaay over the top it became truly annoying. Dirk Pitt does everything so perfectly. He never makes mistakes. He is super-human and super-macho. The character is completely unbelievable. The book could have been great had the characters been more ""down to earth""."
4,Atlantis Found -Amazon Kindle,"In typical form Clive Cussler takes the reader on a gut wrenching roller coaster of adventure, and suspense. Really enjoyable, even if it's a little hard to suspend your disbelief."
5,dirk rules!,"dirk rules! i don't care if my hubby gives me a hard time about loving dirk pitt--and this new story is great. i didn't think i would find another pitt novel as exciting as my favorite (inca gold), but this one was it. i think you have to suspend reality and just sit back and enjoy the ride that dirk, numa and the gang take--this isn't rocket science, its a novel. mr cussler, if you read these reviews, your books are wonderful and i hope you are working on a new pitt novel!"
4,"Good, but...","As an avid Cussler fan, I eagerly awaited the next Cussler adventure. When it arrived under the tree Christmas morning, I quickly lost myself in the story. Typical of Cussler, the book was full of adventure and believable historical fiction. Only Clive could pull together a pre-historical civilization and the Fourth Reich into one plausible adventure.The Only problem was Atlantis did not seem as tight as previous offerings. Small inconsistencies kept me looking back, rather than simply moving forward in the plot. For example, in the early mine rescue, Dirk is wearing a drysuit. When he returns to the mine later, Cussler states Dirk is wearing a drysuit instead of the wetsuit he had on earlier. I felt like this book received no serious proof-reading.Small quirks aside, any Cussler fan will enjoy this book. And for all of Al's fans out there, he finally gets the woman! I look forward to the next Pitt novel, and hope for another Autin adventure."
3,"Love Dirk, Al, and ""Dad,"" but this doesn't measure up","Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels are always fun. The rapport between Pitt and Al Giordano is magic. And when they're front and center, this novel crackles. A Fourth Reich is being planned. The earth will be destroyed. The action is set in the South Pole. All the ingredients for a wonderful novel. Most of Mr. Cussler's novel is exciting. Unfortunately, he brings in a slew of Special Forces guys near the end of the book. They interrupted the flow. I skipped over these characters and raced to the pages with Dirk and Al, or Admiral Sandecker, their stalwart, harried boss. Tom Clancy often brings in new characters in the fighting scenes; perhaps that style works for him, but Mr. Cussler lost me at that point. ATLANTIS FOUND is good, but if you want wonderful Cussler, read SAHARA and INCA GOLD."
4,Great Fun!,"It isn't great literature, but it's a lot of fun! I'm a big Cussler fan and enjoyed this very much. Not his best, but Dirk & Al still manage to save the world and have a blast doing so."
1,old stained book,"I ordered a new book and got an old stained book. It's never been read, but looks like it got wet."
1,So far over the top it flies away,"The second worst book I have ever read. Dialogue is utterly atrocious and the plot just gets more ludicrous as you go.The first few pages seemed promising and having never read a Cussler novel before I was optimistic. After the first few eye rolling sections of dialogue I was starting to worry a bit, but we then progressed to Dirk Pitt's ridiculous stuntman abilities and I abandoned all hope.It reads like an Austin Powers movie plot line with a 80's Schwarzenegger movie dialogue.I like escapism as much as the next person but I just could not get past the awful writing. I had my wife laughing out loud when I would read out a paragraph. If you can read the ""Hitler's Sperm"" references without groaning then you might enjoy this action packed mess, otherwise try something else."
2,"I hated it, you'll probably love it.","Easily the worst the of the seven Pitt novels I have read. I mean, all of the negative reviews pretty much sum up my thoughts. I read books hand over fist but this one took me weeks to plod through. A jumbled mess in dire need of editing. Still, of the many fans I know of these books, this is one of their favourites, so whatever man. This is one of the least likely Pitt adventures, having virutally nothing to do with his career and almost everything to do with being a secret agent / commando. As crappy as a book it makes, it would be an outstanding movie. Cool villans and villanous plot, but in the end, not much comes of it but a gun fight. A little hollywood tweaking here and there and you've have a very fun and forgetable film for all your kids to waste your money on."
2,Definitly not his best,"This was a major dissapointment to me. I have read every Cussler / Dirk Pitt adventure and relish the release of a new one.For lack of a better word, this book was ""tired."" Every book as a lot of the same things and this just seemed like a retread of a retread. I think due to a comment one of the characters makes later in the story that Cussler realizes this himself and may put the series to rest.If this is the best he can do, than I think that's a good idea.If you are a first timer or have only read one or two other books - skip this one. If you are a die hard fan and must read, than do so -I hope you enjoy it more than I did."
3,aaaahhhh Dirk Pitt!,"The ultimate guilty pleasure. With 10 clichés per page he would have failed my freshman English class. We all know Cussler can't write his way out of a rice paper bag, but who cares? He writes a great story and you just gotta love Dirk Pitt."
1,"Bad writing, weak plot, stolen ideas","Cussler's story about a new generation of Nazis based in Argentina is largely built upon Graham Hancock's book Fingerprints of the Gods (a lost maritime civilization, earth-crust displacement, ancient maps, etc.). Cussler tries to create an action/suspense novel using this as a backdrop, and even if his writing weren't so poor - AWFUL dialog, weak characters, unrealistic action sequences - it would still have been challenging to weave a credible storyline out of these elements. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the author fails so miserably in his attempt to do so. At times he came across as an extremely lowbudget version of Tom Clancy, without the depth of knowledge and feel for dialog that Mr. Clancy has, thereby making a bad situation even worse. Atlantis Found is by far one of the worst books I have ever read, and I would highly recommend NOT buying it, and picking up Fingerprints of the Gods instead (and a couple of Elmore Leonard books as well!)."
2,dissapointing,"I have found the last two Cussler ""Dirk Pitt"" novels lacking in their usual excitement and knowledegable entertainment. There seems to be more violence and sexual innuendos than precious books. I feel as if Cussler gave his characters to someone else to write with. Having read every Pitt novel its easy to sense the subtle changes in his tales. The best novels are ""Sahara"" and ""Raise the Titanic""."
5,New Cussler Fan,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! It was full of action packed adventure and great one liners...I recommend it to everyone!!
1,Atlantis Found Awful!,"Never been moved to write a review in many years of reading, but this story is thrown together so carelessly, I found it hard to keep an eye on the plot because of all the sloppy contradictions."
2,The same as always,"Dirk Pitt books are all fun airplane reading - lots of excitement, by the end of which Dirk and Al have saved the world. Same here. Somehow, though, while I can suspend disbelief pretty well for almost any science fiction and for James Bond, Cussler's work always seems to bring me to the brink of disappointing disbelief. And it always takes an effort to get past that. That is true for this book, in spades."
5,Atlantis Found - The best yet!!,"I'm a new Dirk Pitt fan and so far I love it!!I've read Inca Gold and Cyclops. In Atlantis Found Dirk takes us to the South Pole and the reign of the New Dynasty. The book starts us of in the discovery of an old ship carrying artifacts from an ancient civilization that existed nine thousand years ago. From there Atlantis Found takes you on a rollercoaster ride from the depths of a mine in Colorado to the cold depths of the South Pole. Clive Cussler even has a cameo in his own book. Not to give anything away, but readers look for a character referred to as ""Dad""!! With Dirk and Al Giordino's quick wit the book is fabulous. The best yet!!"
3,The Most Ambitious Dirk Pitt Yet!,"I was introduced to Dirk Pitt by reading Inca Gold and have enjoyed that one more than his earlier work. Atlantis Found has a great prologue and a plot that is rapid during the first half of the book and still quite stimulating during the second half. But even with a long book, Cussler has kept the ""fun"" in Pitt. At a time in life that many adventure authors slow down, I feel (i.e. Clancy's The Bear and The Dragon), Cussler has written his best novel yet!"
4,Dirk Pitt.....,"...is just great again! As a longtime reader of Cussler-books, I rank that one among the best. Dirk and Al and the whole NUMA-gang are tough as always, the bad guys (and ladies) are mean and cruel as always and the settings of the story is good choosen as in the previous books."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"This is my first Clive Cussler book. However, I have read other similar adventure-type books in the past. Even though this book is action-packed, it does not leave me wanting to read other CC books. Dirk Pitt is nothing compared to Jack Ryan , whom Dirk mentions in the book. He is just another James Bond."
5,Must Read,"Pick it up and you won't put it down until you're finished. If it's not the best of Clive Cussler, (and I've read them all) it's way up there."
5,"Atlantis Found a ""great"" find","Next to ""Sahara"" this is by far Cussler's best. Riveting, non-stop action once again comes to the forefront where the hero, Dirk Pitt and companions are involved. The historical lessons were fascinating. I was totally glued to this book. The familiar banter between the lovable and admirable characters never ceases to amaze me. This book screamed ""MOVIE"" to me, as did some of his others. I highly recommend this roller coaster ride of a book!"
2,Disappointing,"Decent amount of detail of Madison's congressional career. Regarding personal details, the War of 1812, and his presidency, the writing lacks detail and seems to lose energy. I do not recommend."
3,James Madison by Sidney Howard Gay,"First half was interesting, second half really dry. A good intro to Madison. A better and consistant definition and comparison between Federalists, Republicans, and Democrats would be helpful. Good treatment of the issue of states rights and slavery that leads up to the Civil War. 3 1/2 stars."
2,Secret Mission to the Philippines,"I was disappointed in this book. It was a very short book, actually not much more than a long article. It was sort of a high school level book. Chick Parsons was an amazing guy and a real hero and this book doesn't do him justice. I'm sure there are better books about him that this."
3,Should have been better,"An Argento-protege, good budget, and awesomely moronic storyline (rehearsals for a musical about serial killers--interrupted by a real serial killer!). Still, the movie kinda sucks. The dialog is just too stupidly generic, even for this sort of film. Then, there's that idiotic 80s hair and clothing. Maybe it's just me though--since you get to see all these people die, maybe you'll enjoy it."
4,a little record with alot going on,"this little record from stephen rand and his magic ponies is filled big with mucho guitar gusto along the lines of dinosaur jr and in the track six mr. neil young : but it is silly to compare- this is its own thing. cooly harmonies between the boy and the girl, I like to put this one on at work and in the car , in the multi cd changer on random-so when a song comes on from it, its like a delightful bite into a jelly donut or someone sweet grabing you from behind when you least expect it. tracks 2,5 and 6 are my current favorites."
5,blushing bachelorette,i highly recommend this CD for your listening pleasure. i love steven rands unique vocal style and guitar riffs. a+++++
5,The Poet's Perspective...,"From one poet to another I must say your work is richly written, engaging, and prolific. The pen is mightier than the sword and you have proved just that.You have been blessed with the gift of prose. And I look forward to your next book of poetry. Stay strong, positive, and blessed(...)"
3,It's nice... except it didn't fit.,"I purchased this steering wheel cover for our 2007 F-150 Truck. It arrived within two days, seemed really nice quality. Unfortunately, it did not fit the steering wheel. What a shame."
2,Breaking down already,This went on very well in my 01 Ford Ranger. Easy to use when driving feels good and does not slip. STARTING TO COME APPART ALREADY one of the logos is breaking down after a very short time. Disappointed.
3,Looks Sharp,"These steering wheel cover look fantastic in your Ford. The only thing I find wrong with them is that they are so soft, they are not durable. They will tear or rip if you are removing some item from your car or truck."
3,ford steering cover,"the cover looks good, but in the heat it softens up and it is sticky. don't recommend this cover, i will replace with another."
2,"Hype Williams - The Videos, Vol. 1","These are good videos, no doubt. Hype Williams was a big influence for people like Paul Hunter and Little X. But this whole set is disappointing and predictable. Why must he give us the videos that we've all seen a million times before and can still see today on BET or MTV? How many times have we seen TLC's ""No Scrubs"" and Jay-Z's ""Big Pimpin'""? Where's all of the lesser-known works like Jay-Z's ""Can't Knock the Hustle?"" Where's R. Kelly's ""I Can't Sleep Baby (remix)""? Lin'Que's ""Let It Fall""? Any Missy videos? I was geeked to see Wu-Tang Clan's ""Can It Be All So Simple"" but was upset because they cut the preview of the ""Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin..."" video with ""coming soon"" shown at the bottom. And the interview with Hype was pretty dull. You're better off taping these videos off the TV; at least then you'll get the uncensored version of ""No Scrubs"" (they block out the ""a"" and ""h"" words on here)."
5,Hooray,"Basically, this DVD contains several of Hype Williams favorite music video works. The videos are taken from his own master collection and are high quality with the original aspect ratio intact (some full screen, some widescreen). It is nice to see such complete music videos. There are commentary and about options for each video as well as dolby digital 5.1 sound. There are a lot of memorable videos including Craig Mack's ""Flava In Ya Ear (Remix)"" and Busta Rhymes' ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"". Hype Williams is a great director and this DVD showcases his talent. Hopefully he will release another volume."
2,Where are the instructions?,I need send the watch to the jeweler because the watch don't come with batteries and no have any instructions about how install them.
2,Not much,Thought the book would be more about the history of the building of San Michele and not his practice along with the rich of Capri.
3,Dr Axel's book,"I purchased this book after visiting Anacapri and dr Axel's house there. I was very impressed and wanted to learn more about the man who was able to create such a wonderful residence.This is a very detailed book on Axel's life, experiences as a doctor and medicine and also his thoughts. He was a very complex personality and this gives quite an insight into his feelings and subsequent actions. Some quite confronting ideas about death and dying.There is no mention of his personal life really ~ his wives, children or family but he does talk in detail about some of his animals."
4,Mr Neary's review San Michele -Munthe's Irish wolfhound,I bought this book having read the review mentioningThe Story Of San MicheleAxel Munthe talking to an Irish Wolfhound about ducks BUT I cannot find any mention of this dogPlease could someone post a page/chapter reference?
1,molto frustrante,"A meno che siate ben versati in italiano, non tentare di Kindle l'edizione di questo libro, che non offre alcuna glossario per i termini numerosi italiani frasi e persino frammenti di conversazione che abbondano. Riuscivo a malapena a superare la prima dozzina di pagine prima di uscire frustrato."
5,A thought provoking book,"My father had mentioned this book to me as a teenager. I read portions of it then, but have always wanted to read it in full. Finally, I found a paperback edition and found an absorbing and thought stimulating book. Dr. Munthe's care of the sick, his love of animals and the characters he describes, all will stay in my memory. This is not a book that you read once. I plan to read it again and again. Hopefully I will be able to visit Villa St. Michele some day and see the beauty of the place that he saw. I hope to find a bound edition with the photographs."
3,"""Jug & Dodo"" would be better off just ""Dodo""","This, to me, is a rather strange pairing - and it shows in the material. Ammons (""Jug"")seems to have no fire on this. Given, most of the stuff he is playing are soul/blues (""Georgia On My Mind"" - the first 'listening sample', mislabled as is the CD song list) and ballads. The reason I give this 3 Stars is because of the brilliance of Gene ""Dodo"" Marmarosa. About one-third of this CD is his trio without Ammons, and it is far and away the best material on the CD. Check out 'listening sample #5' below - it is Marmarosa's trio doing ""The Song Is You"". This will give you a small taste of the rest of his stuff on the CD - two takes, totally different ideas, of ""Yardbird Suite"", and a beautiful rendition of Ray Noble's ""The Very Thought Of You"". Marmarosa's stuff is 5-Star, but there is not enough of it, and it is paired badly with the rest of the CD. What a shame. Marmarosa's career sort of mirrored this kind of luck. Man, what could have been..."
1,What happened?,"This show flat out sucks. The first few seasons were good. They had good jokes, that relied on the situation and were smart. Now it's all about shock value. Family Guy are you even trying anymore?"
2,Volumes 8 and 9 are both kinda lame,"Hubby and I have been fans for years and I usually get him the latest volume for Christmas each year. Volume 8 was kinda lame, and this one was worse. I have told him not to expect another season for the upcoming Christmas as it's all just getting kinda boring."
4,About time this is being released. Anyone agree?,"I am a HUGE fan of this show. Have all the other seasons on DVD including the World Domination set with the Stewie head that scares my dog all the time, and it is about time this is being released on DVD.I do agree, would really prefer to see the WHOLE season released on DVD, but at least it is something...right?? right?? Bueller....oops"
2,Missing episodes??,"Am i missing something here, or is this volume missing episodes? The following episodes are not included in this volume: Halloween on Spooner Street, Road to the North Pole, Brian Writes a Best Seller, The Big Bang Theory, Foreign Affairs....these aired during the same season as the rest of the episodes in volume 9, why are they missing? Am i wrong?"
4,Family Guy Season 10,Why hasnt these been realesed in the US it has been released here in Mexico since July i dont know what is taking them so long i already bought it and its in stores everywhere.
5,"If you are looking at this, you know it is good..","If you are looking at this, you know it is good. I dont have to tell you that you should buy them all. seriously"
4,Family Guy,I like the few episodes I have been able to watch. I would probably love it if I had more time to watch it. I would recommend this product to the Family Guy fans.
5,The Best Season Since The First.....Bravo!!!,"I have been a fan of Family Guy since the beginning and I have to say this is the best season since the debut season, and the first episode where Stewie uttered ""The broccoli must die""! Seth MacFarland and the whole Family Guy family have not lost that formula that's made them so successful that it lead to a viewer campaign to bring it back on the air. My favorite installment of this recent volume is the episode titled ""Stewie and Brian"" the 150th episode it's one of the few episodes that have dealt with a serious topic of depression and suicide and not handled it with their trademark no holds bar comedy, sarcasm and just plan political incorrectness, and to me that shows that they have grown and gone to a place in the history of the Family Guy franchise that allows them the freedom and range to do almost anything."
5,Family Guy is the Best,"Got this package in record time, love the show, great packaging, no complaints about the price or the package so far."
3,Its great but it could have been betrer...,i have to say while the show is still funny its definetly not as good as it was originally. im tired of the constant stewie is gay jokes and want him back to trying to take over the world and so forth. the show is now more or less just running pop culture jokes. over all its worth buying for a quick laugh but not much else.
4,Family Guy is funny,My son loves Family Guy and specifically asked for this volumeIt arrived quickly and is exactly what he wanted
5,great movie,"best one ever....loved it. worth the money. love all the family guys but this one would be my favorite. just buy it, you know you want too"
5,Family Guy Volume 9,"This DVD contains all of the episodes from Family Guy season 9. This DVD is great for true Family Guy fans! It includes full uncensored episodes, which make them even more funny! Also, the DVD includes various bonus features including deleted scenes, extra clips, and other Family Guy related content. The episodes never get old and this DVD is perfect for a gift or to add to your own personal collection! Strongly recommended!"
2,enough already,I have loved family guy since it first came out in '99 but the last few years it has really gone sour for me. it doesnnt seem to be as much about humor as it is about shock value. How many times is a bunch of cussing and blood really funny? I felt like the stewie vs lois episodes went especially too far. Its all about seth mcfarlane pushing his political views and beliefs through the brian charachter. Also this whole stewie being gay hint hint is a little weird and so is the fact that brian has sex with women even more disturbing. i really dont seee it going more than a few years. they have run out of humor.
3,Family Guy still no wide or blu this sucks,I know I did not buy it from Amazon but I still bought it and wanted to throw my opinion into it!I can Understand the cost of Blu Ray but WHY CAN'T I GET IT IN WIDE SCREEN ALREADY! I am so sick of the full screen!!!!
1,When will this be released? Are you screwing with me?,"I've been coming to this title for over a year, and still no release date. Is this some kind of marketing experiment to see how many people will order something with no promise of release? Well, I'm not one of them. I'm just one who's very annoyed because I want to watch this blasted DVD. What's the friggin hold up???"
4,Changed My Review,"It seems I was miscounting :)They arent releasing the full seasons in each volume.This one has almost all of Season 8 and some shows from season 9.Season 9 was poorly done and rarely was it funny, but season 8 still had the right flavor to it. Hence the 4 out of five stars."
5,What date did this air???????,I really want to buy the latest Family guy and Simpsons and American Dad and Cleveland but I do not know what seasons they are and Im very frustrated!!!!!!! How about the sellers please put the dates that the season aired so I know if I have already seen these and if theyre OLD!!!!!!!! I want to buy all of the above 2010s and upcoming 2011s.
3,Finally Arived and it Only Took Just a Little Over a Year,"I ordered this item on 30 November 2010, hoping it would arrive by Christmas. And what do you know, it arrived today 22 December 2011!! Amazing that it arrived just before Christmas only it is just One Year Late. I was notified after Christmas last year that the item would be late and after a few eamils back and forth throughout 2010 noting that I still wanted the item, I finally have it! I would like to recommend that items ordered well before Christmas should arrive sometime around Christmas or even New Years, maybe a couple weeks into the new year, but a whole year late is a bit long to wait. Don't you think so??"
3,ok,My son wanted to watch dvd with bob the builder so I bought this dvd. but he wasn't too crazy about this dvd. He probably sat there for 5 minutes and that was it. Maybe it is hard to follow every thing they say and do. My son is more of the Thomas fun. This dvd is just sitting on our shelves now.
3,Childrens DVD,"My grandson enjoyed the video. I could have gotten it at the store just as cheaply, though. Just got it since I was already purchasing another toy for him."
5,NIce addition to our son's DVD library,My almost-3-year-old son loves this movie! He would watch it all day if you let him. Some of the stories are a litte goofy but he seems to love them all.
3,I thought it would be better,"I had never seen Bob the Builder, but it seemed popular so I bought this for our son. I think the episodes are a little corny. Maybe other dvds are different but this one really doesn't concentrate on any construction. The first episode Bob is taking dance lessons and another he ends up delivering pizzas. I thought because he was Bob the BUILDER he would mostly be building things. Not sure we will be purchasing another Bob the Builder video."
5,Remarkable Poetry Collection,"William Pratt does a remarkable job in collecting the leading poems from the Fugitive Poets, the collection of intellectuals and writers who were based around Vanderbilt University in the 1920s. The leading poems of Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, Donald Davidson, John Crowe Ransom and others are here. Some of the poems can be found in other collections of course but Pratt's book offers a comprehensive look at these poets who greatly shaped American and Southern literature in the 20th century. Pratt offers a very solid introduction in which he reminds readers to think of the poets as different than the Agrarian circle that published ""I'll Take My Stand"" a few years after the Fugitive magazine went under. This is one of the finest anthologies of 20th century American poetry that I have come across. This review covers the third edition of ""The Fugitive Poets"" which was released in 1991."
3,The music is good,I loved the music. I was looking for more contemporary women ministry music. The words on the screen are too small unless put on a projection screen. We only had a tv. Suggest frames that roll with bigger font.
3,A review by Allens grandson,"I am R.C. Allens grandson and after he passed away in the 1990s I decided to read this book for the fun of it. It spends some amount of time on eastern philosophy, mentioning the concept of the ""3rd Eye"", and mixes positive meditation and ""Christian faith"" into some sort of hybrid method for achieving success. This almost makes me suspect my grandfather was years ahead of his time. In any case the book is very good to read and it will leave any reader with a strong ""positive"" feeling when they finish the book. The book spends a great deal of time teaching you how to think positive, have faith in Christ, and learn now to make your prayers work for you."
2,Success!,"How do you become a success? Well one start is to read this powerful book The Secret of Success by R.C. Allen.A seminal classic it delves into the importance of faith, the power of intention, and good old hard work.The secret is made up of many steps but the infinite intelligence and creative spirit comes from the use of your brain. It explores some of the tenets of what has become known in the modern lingo as the ""power of intention"".Mixed in with some proverbs form the Bible, Allen delves into living the life you want to lead by moving in the direction of your dreams. Prosperity is only a state of mind and if you can dream it you are definitely able to achieve it.With faith, focus, and follow through, a little pray can open the window to the limitless opportunity that the world has to offer. A very powerful book that makes a great gift or constant reminder of what can be done!"
5,Great book,This is a good book to start your journey to self discovery. It quite spiritual in nature. It will open your eyes and mind.
3,Definitely not their best.,This Murder Metal is not really bad but not as impressive as Dahmer for example. Therefore I would even say not a very recommendable album.For starters you got Acid Bath Vampire; bit disappointing and way too long. To cut it short this album just lacks the scent of magic and you'll probably have a lot more fun with early Macabre stuff. Check it out for yourself.
2,sellout.,Sounds to me like their audience was waning so they added some cheesy modern death metal elements which is really sad. Combining this generic death metal garbage with the classic macabre sound just does not work. Very disappointing.Check out their 93 cd Sinister Slaughter. That's a masterpiece.
5,"No te lo pierdas, fierita!","Brillante perfomance de DEEP PUEPLE ante mas de 300.000 personas en el Ontario Motor Speedway, en 1974. No hay mas que escuchar el poder de la voz de Coverdale haciendo brillar gemas como ""Might you take your life"", dejarse llevar por un Blackmore furioso que literalmente destruye todo a su paso, sorprenderse por un Hughes mezcla de angel y demonio que nos deja exhaustos de solo escucharlo, en fin, un show para el asombro de una banda única en un momento mágico de su carrera: DEEP PURPLE MK III"
4,Easy install,It fit's a little tight. I think it will loosen up some as time passes. Double stitching on the seams appears to be well made.. Cost almost as much as the Total original purchase...
2,"Overpowering, not for anyone over 20-25","My roommate wears this stuff, and I can't stand it. Being a woman, I can definitely say women DON'T like it. It reminds me of the over-cologned boys in high school, and it is a very young scent. I would put it just a step above something from Axe. It smells very young. Of course, my roommate practically pours it on, so that could be a problem. This stuff is very strong. It will linger in a room for 20 minutes after someone wearing it has left, and it sticks to anything it touches (pets, couches, etc.).So, if you wear it, please, mist lightly. Just one spray into the air then walk through it. I've realized men have the tendency to overdo it. I would recommend going to a more sophisticated and subtle scent for anyone over 20 or so. But, I guess this would be a good gift for someone going through puberty."
4,Awesome,"Almost every time I wear ""Curve"" I get comments from the ladies, a very good thing. I currently have 10 different types of cologne and I wear this one a lot. It seems good and the scent lasts throughout the day without having to drench yourself in it."
3,Okay!!!!,"Averge cologne at best,I won't wear it to a Club or a Dinner date but I might use for work!!! what can you expect for 22 dollars..."
2,Not worth for the price. Doesn't smell at all after 30minutes,"Bought this one and 360 Red Perry Ellis together from Amazon. Shipping was on time.I prefer to use strong cologne sprays, and used Tommy H. cologne spray most of the time for the same price. I must admit that this cologne spray does not smell as good as the review says. The smell evaporated within 30 minutes from clothes. Smell is OK but nothing so special about it. If I would have to spend same money for spray next time, I would prefer to buy some other branch but not this one for sure. Not worth for the money."
1,Please Don't Buy,I regret buying the cologne from Amazon. What i received was basically water. It has the smell but doesn't last for more than 10 mins. My friend bought the same thing and he said his cologne was sealed. But mine wasn't. It just came in the box. I would never buy from Amazon again.
5,My girlfriend loves this...and so do I!,"My girlfriend acutally introduced me to curve. She really likes it, so i picked up a bottle...and i love it too! wish i had found this a while back! everyone comments about it...smells so good! you can't go wrong with curve!"
1,price per oz?,Why do all the ads have an incorrect price per oz. Example:I keep seeing price per oz a little over $2 but a 4+oz bottle price is $20A few of the ads had the correct price per oz at +$5.oz
5,Great price!,"Very inexpensive compared to retail stores. Comes in a tin, and makes a perfect gift! Buy for any man in your life as a great Christmas gift."
2,Very similar to Lucky Brand cologne imho,"I only paid $3 for an .18 oz trial at Wal Mart. It was half off. I'd been wanting to try one of their products for sometime. It smells very reminiscent of Lucky Brand cologne which I am not a fan of. This is just very slightly different but pretty close to Lucky. I also got a trial of Curve Wave which is a lot better and more of a citrusy scent, goes nice with it being summer! I give this 2 product stars. Someone else in a Curve review here said this was also close to Ralph Lauren Polo cologne which I have never dealt with."
1,Reviews make this Great?,Okay i bought the 6.8oz thinking it was going to smell good from all the good reviews but i was wrong it smells bad and doesnt even last long all my friends think it smells bad and it does so don't buy this totally not reccommend.
1,FAKE DO NOT BUY,"I purchased the 4.2 oz bottle and after spraying it it smells like the real deal, but shortly after the scent changes and starts to fade. I've been using Curve now for the past 10 years so I can tell the difference..... Please don't purchase this item, you will be disappointed..."
5,Great Smell - Great Price!,My Husband LOVES curve....and we normally pay a lot more for it! I was thrilled to find his fav at a great price!
3,Not long lasting at all,"May be its a Cologne, that's why its not long lasting but I expected it to be long lasting expecting its more than average price compare to other cologne.I just love smell but I wish if it stays more than 2 hours on my cloths"
3,"Decent and affordable, but...","It simply gets old rather fast. The scent is really nice, until you have to smell it on a daily basis. Then it just becomes headache inducing. Aside from that though, this smells pretty good and is certainly a bargain. So, sample before buying. That would be my advice. As this is likely a cologne you will only wear once in a while."
4,La Salsa Sensual,"Este album es chevere! Es bien bailable y los ritmos son muy complejos, sin embargo es genial para escuchar o para bailar y tambien tiene unas baladas y las canciones de la salsa y de las baladas son muy sensuales y los cantantes de Son By Four tienen voces muy bien claros y pueden cantar superbien para colaborar los ritmos sensuales con cantar lo cual hace fabuloso."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this product as a Christmas present for my daughter. When she opened the box, several of the plastic lids fell off, hit the floor and broke. I could not recommend the spice rack."
2,Broken lids,I was really excited to get this product to organize my pantry and spices. When I opened the box multiple lids were cracked and broken. Pretty disappointing considering how much I paid. I tried to contact them to send replacement lids but I still haven't heard back from the company.
4,pretty good,"This is of very good quality despite being acrylic. It comes with screws to mount to the wall.the only bad thing, as others have mentioned, is that it does not hold the entire contents of a regular spice bottle - so u do have to keep a almost empty bottle or to just throw it away. I wish the bottle would hold a little more. The labels are nice - overall i am happy with the purchase."
4,Something's Missing,"I was very pleased with the quality of the product and the speed of its arrival. However, after checking the packaging more than once, I realized I did not get the preprinted labels as promised. I did see the printing on the box that said labels included. Now I either have to go to the expense of time and make my own (which won't look as nice) or choose to spend more money and purchase a set. My quest for organization in my kitchen is thwarted again."
2,F1 2000,"i bought this game because it offered the first chance to see and drive the new indy f1 track. the track is interesting and flat as a pancake with a bunch of switchbacks. as far as the actual game goes, i was disappointed to find out the f1 2000 graphics do not campare to any of the need for speed games by electronic arts. i expected more, it's not great, its just ok."
2,Only so-so,"After a year of playing EIDOS' '98 Formula 1 this was a sad disappointment. Game play is not as responsive as Eidos, and fails in comparison. Steering and braking sensitivity wasn't easily adjusted. I would suggest holding out for the new version from Eidos. Even an unimprovemed '99 version from Eidos would be better than this."
4,It's still the best available,"Everyone likes to beat up this game. It is a very entertaining and realistic F1 simulation. It's not an arcade game like need for speed. You will need at least 450mhz, a good 3d accelerator and a steering wheel and it runs great. The only problem with the game is the AI. Racing other cars can be tough - but if you make it through the start (not often) and avoid braking early it is pretty real. Just running hotlaps by yourself is easily worth the price of this game. The tracks were done great! Don't believe the nay sayers. If you like F1 and race simulations, you will like F1 2000."
1,There are better F1 sims!,"This game looks good, but doesn't play well. After playing EIDOS's Official Formula 1 Racing, this game doesn't even compete (and OF1R is two years old)! Whether you like super realistic or arcade style sims, F1 2000 isn't what you're looking for. Hold out for EIDOS's Formula 1 World Grand Prix, or just get Official Formula 1 Racing."
1,could it be any worse?,"I played a better F1 game back in 1995. First I thought it's some kinda joke. Everything sucks in this game, graphics are like out of 1990 'ies. If you wanna spend your money, do it elsewhere. I really regret that I bought this ""game""."
2,"Needs refinement, maybe F1 2001?","Well, in a nutshell this is the reason I went out and bought a new system. (AMD 750, Voodoo 5/5500). The game is sluggish even on my new machine. The game will not recognize my Video Card for Glide Support, which was detected on my older Voodoo 3/3000. There is no rain, and if you over-rev the engine It does not blow up. Everything else is great, the graphics are top-notch, the engine sounds are a litte weak, and the sim-factor is too-realistic (but fun). This game will not run well on anything slower than a P3 or a Athlon with a spendy 3d card and 128Mb of RAM. If you have the Horsepower, it should be a fun game. If you dont, It will just frustrate you."
4,Nice job EA,"A must buy if you are an F1 fan...best F1 sim I have ever played. This game gives you the ultimate in flexibility with regards to fine tuning your car. Max out the realism...and you will get your adrenaline pumping...but you better have at the very least a PIII 600 w/128 MB RAM if you want to race with other cars! This game is a massive resource hog...I give the opponent AI about an 8 out of 10...You gotta have a steering wheel...digital steering will get you nowhere...you will be doing so many donuts, krispy kremes will be jealous..."
2,Some problems with this one,"I have been using Lonely Planet books for years and am surprised that it would turn out a guide as skimpy and shoddily written as this. The maps are useful, but the text's author, Wendy Yanagihara, seems to be unfamiliar with (or unable to get a sense of) Tokyo's character and its people. Yanagihara seems more bemused than informed, and one can only wonder why she was hired to write about a complex metropolis that she does not seem to understand. I agree with the reader above about the Lonely Planet Japan and Lonely Planet Tokyo guides -- both are good. I'd add another to the list: Time Out Tokyo, which surpasses anything Lonely Planet has yet produced as a guide to Tokyo."
4,Up and Coming New Artist,"Mark Armstrong's debut CD features a number of exceptional tracks. I originally heard this artist while he was a student at UCLA, where he won top honors in a series of Spring Sing competition performances. A truly excellent talent."
2,Impossible to use by yourself if you are a woman,"If you are a woman, the calipers require you to take a tricep measurement of your right tricep. There is no way you can do this by yourself, as you need to pinch the area and measure it at the same time with one hand. Also, it requires you to take all 3 measurements (tricep, illiac crest and thigh) because it will calculates a fat %, so it is limiting in that respect. If you want to be more scientific, I would get a manual caliper.It also is set up to measure and store 3 users, which may be an issue if you are training multiple people."
1,Save your money!,"I was absolutely disgusted when I opened the package, and the supposed ""Improve your measuring skills"" booklet was not included. I also need to mention that the measurements may be close, but the calculation is RIDICULOUSLY inaccurate. I sent a complaint to the company and recieved no response whatsoever. Manual calipers may be less convenient, but at least you can do the math yourself, and come up with an accurate number. Save your money!!"
1,piece of garbage,"I just got one of these at GNC and paid way too much. Its a piece of garbage, Does not work at all. Put the battery in and it is just beeping, flashing OK. Finally after pressing NEXT about 20 times the profile for B flashes. The display doesn't work properly and showed from what I could tell a body fat % of 0.00%"
2,WIldly inaccurate despite much effort,"I was debating between this product and the hand held electronic device, and I chose this because I felt it would be more accurate. I have owned it for 3 weeks now, and I have yet to get a reproducible reading that was accurate. I have watched videos, read the instructions and even called their support number. Generally it tells me I am 1.4% when I should be around 12%. The Myotape is great, but I would have been better off with the hand held devise and the measuring tape."
3,calipers arent easy,"The calipers are kindof hard to get used too....Actually to be honest, i havent' figured out how to use them yet."
2,Forget the Caliper and get the Myo Tape only,"The problem with this caliper lies not in the product itself but in how hard it is to take consistent measurements. I don't doubt the caliper's accuracy, but I've tried measuring myself over and over and the values I get vary by as much as 15 mm. The instruction manual that it brings is far too basic and does not give a clear understanding of how to take measurements. I believe there are manuals for sale that are supposed to help you get consistent values, but I don't own one myself. Without such a manual, I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere. Also, the product description states that you can take measurements yourself, but unless you have four arms, it is impossible to do without someone to help you.The Myotape, on the other hand, is very easy to use and will give you accurate measurements every time. It is the only reason I rated this product with 2 stars instead of only one. You are better off buying the measuring tape by itself."
1,Absolute junk,"The battery wouldn't stay locked in and kept popping out, and one of the buttons on the front broke the first time I pushed it, making it inoperable. Avoid."
1,Useless,"The display on the device is barely visible when it is even working at all. I can't believe anyone would sell a product his bad. Even when I'm able to squint and see the numbers, it often doesn't work. I thought it might be my understanding of the product but even when reading the instructions and following them closely it just doesn't work. I would try several times, over and over again and still there is no way this device is working right.Sometimes I'll get a body fat percentage that I can see, but when I'm able to repeat the test the numbers are completely different. I either have extremely low body fat or I'm obese. Makes me wonder if the product is just a random number generator.Do not buy this product."
3,"Don't buy the calipers if you are obese, get the Myotape by itself!","It just is too hard to get accurate skinfolds if you are very fat. You will probably do better with a good measuring tape and accurate scale for monitoring fat loss. There are web calculators that you can plug in weight and some tape measurements to get close for a bodyfat percentage.Plus, for a woman, the triceps site is tricky to do, unless you have a measuring partner.I'm keeping the calipers for now, in hopes that someday I'll be thinner and able to use them with better results than currently.Now, the MYOTAPE it comes with, THAT, I LIKE! A great idea and very convenient to use for taking body girth measurements. So my recommendation is to buy the Myotape separately and don't bother with the calipers.So I'm giving it a three stars, because of the included Myotape. Otherwise, I'd probably give it one or two stars if it was just the calipers."
4,Does what it's suppose to but...,This thing pinches what you pinch and tells you how thick it is. it'll work as consistently as you are able to consistently pinch the same amount of skin from yourself in the same area's.your probably not going to use this for day to day measurements as the differences are going to be ridiculously minute and more prone to typical discrepancies between your pinches of skin. whereas a good scale you might track 1/2 a pound here and be more encouraged.i gave it a good review as it does exactly what its suppose to and pretty effectively but i'm not sure about the results. i come up with 5% body fat and maybe i'm just self conscious but that seems a little too good. i would assume i'd be more around 7-10%it really seems a decent well made product but unless you are hardcore fitness junkie i'd just go with one of the scales with the body fat electric current thing and check it in the mornings before food/water. it's more apt to be consistent for you.
1,IT SUCKS!,"The one I got didnt work... Its not that precise, and mine only took the measurements, but never gave me body fat %. SInce Im in mexico.. Is complicated to send it back and to get it re-sent to me. THUMBS DOWN!"
3,Not too bad,"I've been following the instruction manual, but the numbers I'm getting are too low. I don't think I'm that fit. Maybe with a little more practice I'll get more accurate numbers, but so far this hasn't helped me much."
3,It does what it is supposed to.,"I like this product a lot. The only real problem I have had is that the measurements can vary greatly each time unless you are very careful. The measurements goes off of the amount of pressured applied and when it reaches the right pressure before you set the caliper you could get false result.The measuring tape is awesome, it makes measuring arms, legs and waists a snap. I use this more than the caliper."
1,Very disappointed.,"The problem with this caliper, is you get a different reading everytime you measure. Why bother to track your body fat when you don't even know for sure which reading is the accurate one, or maybe none of them are. I measured over and over again, and not once did I get the same reading. As far as I'm concerned this was a big waste of money."
2,Not very acurate,"Purchased this product after losing over 100lbs. I needed to get a better sense of my progress on my weight loss program and how much muscle to fat ratio I had after such an extreme and rapid weight loss program. The calipers are difficult to use and often give a different reading each time I test the same site. Often the readings are extremely different and make no sense. An example would be going from 30% to 11% fat. Basically it's a cheap product that will do in a pinch to help with a very, and I mean very, rough estimate of my body fat percentage if used with extreme patience. It will do in a pinch but I suggest purchasing a more reliable, and easier to use product for more money if your looking for a more accurate reading."
3,"Worked great, but then it broke","Worked great, seemed really awesome but then it started blinking and making crazy noises and I would have to take out the battery just to make it stop. Now I'm on Amazon looking to buy another one.. grumble, grumble"
4,Great Product and Price!!!,"Although digital calipers are usually not recommended, I figured i'd give them a try. They are easy to use and work as described. The measuring tape is ok, however I wish the fit of the tape was a bit snugger. It easily falls out of the locking hole."
2,bad design,the caliper does not even have a cover for the battery. The battery keeps falling out during use which is very frustrating
2,Not worth the money!,This item has already quit working and you cannot get an accurate measurement when it was working. If you take 2-3 measurements they are all different and not even close to the others. The tape measure is great but not the calipers.
2,Not for your first or second grader,"This cd set is useful for children learning the alphabet and numbers.There are a lot of tedious musical numbers for the child to sit through to earn a star. After getting all the stars you can print a certificate.This was somewhat amusing for my 3 year old but does not teach sounding out of letters or other important reading skills.If you want something to help your child really advance in 1st or 2nd grade this is not the software you want.If you want something to amuse a preschooler or kindergarten child, you may find this useful, especially if your child likes singing along. (My child does not).This is a 2 CD set. The second CD ""Smiletown"" is rather poor quality with these annoying ""pokemon"" type characters - younger children may find it interesting but not much educational value."
4,Good for certain purposes,"For it's intended purpose it's good until the novelty wears off. I have found however that it is a powerful aid in physical therapy. I recently had serious trauma to the middle of my left index finger. Even after closing up and being healed for the most part, I still had almost no range of motion to my finger. I was following the instruction from my physical therapist, which was to use a heating pad and massage to loosen the finger. Then to practice moving the joints. With this device I can get the first part of the process done in a quarter of the time with little pain. This is far better than the excruciating 10 minutes of manual massage with the same outcome. So basically what I'm saying is that if my masseuse popped this out, I'd laugh, but if it were my physical therapist then I might be up for it."
3,Floyd Fetch Toy,"Flies nicely, dog seems like to catch it and it is soft on his mouth, unlike hard plastic disks. White canvas-type cover becomes filthy almost immediately, and stains remain even after washing....of course, the dog doesn't know or care about the stains - it's just the person who finds it unappealing after a relatively short use period."
5,Raul's Review,"Bossa Nova, classical music, and jazz all come together in this recording by the great Brazilian master and one of my favorites, Paulinho Nogueira.Brazil is the land of sea, beach, samba, and guitar. It is said that there is hardly a home in Brazil that does not own a guitar. It says a whole lot that Paulinho Nogueira is the guitarist's guitarist in his native Brazil - for very good reason, as evident in this CD.He graces us with lovely interpretations of the bossa songs ""O Barquinho"", Chovendo na Roseiro, Manha de Carnaval, and Tons e Semitons, while also playing classical pieces Concierto de Aranjuez, Ave Maria, and Adios Nonino. And to round out the styles, Nogueira performs jazz clasics Laura, Moonglow, Embraceable you, and others.The guitar playing is impeccable and the arrangements are rivettingly impressive. I also have to offer kudos for the programming of the CD, truly offering something great for everyone.Listen to this great master - again and again!"
5,The Book You Take to the Desert Island,"I started referring to this book, when I found it in a local library. It literally covers everything that was made for a period of 40 Classic years. After it was sold by the library (I missed the sale,) I searched for months until I found it on Amazon. I have repaired a dozen bikes since then, and the book had service for every one. You won't regret buying this. It's worth it."
3,came on time,"pretty good,many pen-markers so I can not erase .A piece of advice for someone who wants to sell books after using try NOT to take note or do exercises by pen"
5,Perfect,"Thank You very much! I got my order in 6 days in very good condition. There are some notes inside, as I was told, but it does not bother me at all. Thanks again."
1,not arive,the book that i bought is not send by the seller. The book itself is a great book. the content is really helpfull for an ESL student.
1,Total garbage,"This is a complete waste of money. It is thin rubber, and it broke on me before I even used it once. The company I bought it from claims that it is non-returnable."
3,Nokia cell transfer cord,"I wasn't able to track this item, but it was received in a timely manner. You get what you see. Just the cord, no instructions (which I'm sure is online), but I didn't want to have to surf the net. I wasn't able to just plug it in and have a step by step guide, but I might have clicked a wrong button. I tried again later, but nothing popped up. Haven't checked the web yet."
5,Nokia OEM Works great,The cable was delivered as advertised. I works great. I have had problems with non-oem cables in the past.
2,"Boxy, wooden, crate like wastebox","There is nothing basket-like about this item. It is heavy, wooden, and suggested for a nursery? Bcuz of the nursery theme, i thought..outta work fine as a small bathroom, or bedside wastebasket. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It has sharp edges, and its very heavy,(i bought 2),to be so small. I stuck 'em in corners, and even the coloring is a tad bit garrish. Perhaps as a set, within the entire line, it works, but i'd NEVER place in a childs room, cuz if they ever touch or fall over one, OMG!One more thing...there is a big, white label stuck permanantly to the inside bottom of each one. You CANNOT peel it off, and it looks awful when you are standing looking in. Therefore, you gotta put a bag, or something in there to hide that. Just a total waste for me. Oh well."
1,Westinghouse sucks,"I bought this photo frame on December. Not even 2 months, it start to have flickering screen and the color totally out.Tried to call the customer service number which took me 20 minutes to have someone to answer me. It is obviously a hardware failure, the CSR just told me to format this stupid junk which don't even stable with the USB connection cable to PC.My Advice, don't buy anything from Westinghouse. Cheap price come with cheap product. And most of all, Sucks customer service."
2,"Westinghouse 6 mo warranty, breaks in less than a year","I received this from my daughter at Christmas. Started to use about Feb '08. Started to give problems about Aug'08 and self destructed Oct'08.Made in China. Can't they make something that you don't have to throw away in ""special"" trash that lasts more than a year or 2. This just sat on the desk, no movement,ect First to go was the Menu buttons,ect. Instructions have always been incomplete. Used a flashdrive with it the whole time.Would not buy another."
5,Great Photo Frame LCD,Bought this over 5 years ago. Still works. Love it. It was not the most expensive model and I had no idea this would work so well. Very happy
5,Excellent!,"After much research I purchased this frame for my son. He has about 300 honeymoon pictures and I wanted to give him a way to show them off without having to resort to a slideshow on the TV. He LOVED this frame. He does all the downloading and programming on his computer so that he doesn't have to deal with the small buttons on the frame or a remote. He said he had to hang it on the wall since the sofa table made it hard to see the pictures because of the height, angle and nature of LCD pictures. The 8"" picture view was recommended because otherwise it was very difficult to see pictures taken on a higher pixel digital camera and I must say these pictures are very clear. My son turns off the frame at night because he said you really need to just leave it on max brightness to clearly see pictures."
1,100% Failure (3 out of 3),"I bought 3 of these frames in November of 2007 for Christmas gifts. There are many positives about this frame, from it's 800x600 resolution to it's price point (at the time). However, over the last 6 months (April 2009 to October 2009) all 3 have failed. The failure mode is exactly the same with all 3, you power up the frame and the display just does not come on and displays a random bunch of horizontal lines. The issue has to do with reading from the SD/MMC/CF/USB slots/ports because the frame works fine if I remove the card or usb key from it and power it up. However, this means you cannot actually put any images on cards and display them. 100% failure in 3 frames."
3,No remote,Excellent resolution but would be nice to have a remote. Assumed it came with a remote for the price I paid. NOT. Should have read the specs better. Other units with remote have equal resolution. Look around before purchasing and read carefully.
3,"good item, but not good selle: BigCity","the item is refurbished but it wasn't in the description.I bought 3 and 1 never workedthe ones working are goodtalking to the seller about all that, I really NOT satisfied"
1,courteous return policy and actions,the item didn't work and we were all very disappointed. However the seller was quick and cooperative and return and full refund.i would have no problem buying electronic items form this seller based on their prompt and courteous return actions.
1,refunded money without explaination,"Hello, I ordered this product approximately two weeks before Christmas, and one week later received emails saying that my payment had been refunded because I returned the product. I did not even receive the product, so there is no way I could have returned it. I wrote two emails to the company trying to understand what had happened. My first email got the response that my money has been refunded, again not stating a reason. My second email got no response at all. Overall, this seems to be a shady company with poor representative skills."
1,"Looks good, worked for a year...","I got two of this from a different website (and at a higher price). The product looks good, picture resolution is good. But it died after 10 months of use. Perhaps the life of the product is only so many hours.. but the manufacturer does not say anything about the hours."
4,Great present...,"Bought this for my mother. She loved it.The 4 pictures at a time mode is great.the shipment was very timely, and the price is right."
5,"Excellent features, Great Value","About a year ago, I bought one of the larger Westinghouse digital frames as a gift for my wife, and she loves it. So this year I bought the 8-inch version as a Christmas gift for my aunt. Definitely a big hit with her, too!On both the 8"" and 14"" units, color is crisp and resolution is exceptionally good, unlike some of the no-name products I looked at. Backlight is strong enough for viewing in all but direct sunlight.Best features are:1. the Mosaic-View, which allows you to set up many effects/transitions between pictures, as well as ""tiling"" multiple images on the screen at once2. The variety of external memory types it supports - everything from the original CF chips right up through Ultra-SD and USB sticksAll in all, a great product and a reasonable price!"
4,"Remote, please",I read all the reviews before purchasing and I agree with what most had to say about this product. There is no perfect digital frame at this price. The picture quality is amazing compared to some other frames. I wish it had a remote and the buttons are a little touchy as far as how long to hold them. So it took me a few tries to maneuver through the menus. The mosaic view was not my style. Overall I was happy enough to purchase a second one as a gift.
1,NOT compatible with Macs,After purchasing this frame we found out it is not compatible with Macs. There is nothing in the literature to forewarn someone of this. Looks like it would be a good product if it supported Macs.
1,No Lingering Apple Scent,"I read rave reviews about this product from other pet owners with obviously much smellier pets than my little Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. After soaking his back with the wonderful fragrance, I caught up with him when he went into another room, and there was absolutely no lingering apple fragrance! It was so shocking that I tried it two more times to no avail. I'm not sure what happened, but I wish I could get the same nice results the other dog owners experienced."
5,"Pet Spray, Apple","Very nice apple scent, I use it on my goldens especially when they come in and are damp from rain or snow. They like it too. Tails a waggin..."
4,Trendnet AP used as wireless bridge,I am using this as a wireless bridge to connect my Directv & Xbox to my Fios wireless router. It was easy to setup once I realized that the shared key setting & WEP settings weren't the same. Once that confusion was removed the setup was about 5-10 minutes. Overall a good product for the cost.
3,"Great Product, Awful Customer Service","This product arrived timely and in good shape. The Customer Service group, however, did not assist in setting up the product and is only limited to reading the same limited materials that come with the product. I was told on 3 occassions that they had to escalate my issues and that they would be calling me back.....I am still waiting. Luckily I figured out how to handle my issue via another means"
3,Works,"It feels a little flimsy but it works, can't complain with that. The software is easy to use. I like the ability to use this as a client device that allows you to transparently bridge any wired ethernet enabled device to your wireless network via an existing Access Point or Router."
3,Good product-hard setup,"This is being used with Directv to download movies. (You need a high-speed internet connection). I read reviews on this product, and there are many all over the net. Many have had problems getting the thing to work, and I was one of them. It took a few hours, and to tell the truth I cant say for sure how I finally got it working. However, once connected, it works great. You can download movies, directv shows, etc, at a good speed. You can even watch tv while downloading movies with the right directv equipment."
2,"Good idea, poorly implemented.","I bought this product solely to act as a bridge to my PS2, which was too far from the router to connect via cable.While it would connect, it would tend to ""drop"" the connection frequently, and long enough for the PS2 to drop connection and kick.I have several other devices and handhelds which I use around the house at longer ranges which never experience this drop.2 stars because it technically works, but the documentation was terrible, and it was useless for my purposes."
1,Buy only if you have a C.S. Degree,"It is collecting dust next to my Direct TV tuner, why? because it is impossible to connect it to my secure wireless network. The simplistic instructions do not work and it is not worth it to me to spend the 5 hours of hell to get this thing to work. Let me repeat, do not buy unless you are or have access to someone who works on computer networks for a living or this will be a waste of money for you."
4,Works great as a access point,This product works great. I used it to bridge the gap with my blue-ray players network connection and my wireless Lan downstairs in my house. It worked perfectly. I am now able to update my blue-ray player using the wireless network.
1,Didn't work with Airlink,I tried and tried to get this AP to work with my Airlink wireless router to no avail. Customer support was O.K.
2,"Painful, Difficult Setup","Immediately before setting up this access point, I setup the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming Adapter. Both were needed to connect to my existing wireless router for remote devices. The Linksys product took me 5 minutes, painless, beautiful, wonderful. Then I moved on to this, the Trendnet Wireless Access Point. What a painful setup, and I'm an IT nerd. It was 2 hours of figuring out the right steps necessary to get this compatible with my wireless network. Any mistakes made during the setup process made the Trendnet completely unresponsive, forcing several resets to the factory default. If you do anything outside of the simple configuration and don't have some networking knowledge, find another product.2 stars only because once I got it working, and it seems to work fine, otherwise 1 star for difficult setup and poor documentation."
2,"Unusuable after a few months, sucks with Bittorrent/power users",This router is no good if you're a power user. It gets overwhelmed all too easily if you're running multiple applications communicating with the Net from multiple computers. It also does not play well with Bit Torrent.I had to replace it finally after it stopped handing out IP addresses and would not allow me to establish a connection to it from any PC despite trying all possible methods.You get what you pay for in routers I think.
1,poor customer support,It did not work out of the box and technical support was of no help at all. It's a great price but doesn't save you anything if you can't get help.
4,TRENDnet 54Mbps 802.11G Wireless Access Point,"The TRENDnet 54G is a nice device, good range, works well. Setup could be a little challenging if you're not very technical. I think it has more features for a lower price than most access points. Over all a solid product."
2,Didn't quite work,"I tried using it with a WPA-PSK (AES/TKIP) network as a wireless repeater, and it didn't quite work. I'm not sure what went wrong. At first it would work fairly well, and I would see a jump in my wireless strength, with a slight latency, but after a short period of use (~30 minutes) the entire wireless network would melt down and become unusable.I'm actually seriously considering just getting a second internet connection, WDS requires nearly identical hardware/software (that supports WDS)."
2,Xbox 360 problems,"The reason I purchased this item was to hook up my Xbox 360 to the internet. I didn't even want to play games over the network, I just wanted to download updates and game add ons (like for Batman AC). The set up is horrible. Instructions are worthless. If you buy this, read the reviews on here of people who are smarter than the employees of TRENDnet to see how to actually set it up. Now to the review of why I bought it. It did work..... for about 10 minutes. Then it dropped the connection. I reset the access point. It worked for about another 10 minutes and then dropped the connection again. I was even in mid download of something when the connection stopped. DO NOT BUY FOR THE XBOX. At least returns are easy to Amazon..... :)"
3,No real instructions,So I'm trying to set this thing up but the only instructions are talking about how to use the wizard to set up the access point. Which is pretty easy without requiring installation instructions. So I have to give this a low score. There are no instructions on how to set this up using the advanced settings. It took hours playing with the settings and going back and forth from computer to ps3 until it finally started working. I called the support and all they did was try to guide me through the wizard that didn't work.They didn't seem to know what they were talking about. So if you want a access point that is straightforward and easy to setup. This is definitely not the one but if you want to save money this might be for you. But be prepared to spend time figuring out the advanced settings if the wizard doesn't work.
3,cuban link chain reaction,"i must say i waited long for this albumt o drop it was definately a good ab\lbum i still feel like the production on this album could have been a little better,but i like a couple a tracks letter to pun shake down talk about it no falla and coming home with me its a not a bad album is okey and it could have been better but is an okey album not a classic do"
3,Disappointing,I'm a keep it as real as I can without having to disrespect one of my favorite MCs that should have had his shine a while ago. This album was a very disappointing one considerin I wanted another 24K album for his first official release and that he didn't get to hit white america. I want him to blow up big and this album with the unconstructive beats and harsh tone in his voice didn't make it an important album to strick a nerve in the hiphop community or the industry for that matter. He needs to go back to that smooth ladies man representing more of his latin side instead of that hardcore street image.
4,Solid album,"I loved Cuban Link ever since his early days with TS. This album is a very solid release. Is he breaking new ground? No. Is his lyrical content going to change the way you listen to hip-hop? No. But he offers solid verse after verse even when his production is a little lagging (sorry Swizzy, you didn't bring the heat on this album). There are some pretty notable tracks, all in all I'm glad Cuban Link was finally able to get his music out some way some how after 24 Carats or whatever was shelved. Somehow, I feel that Cuban had a stronger connection to Pun then did Fat Joe. That's strictly opinion, but at least Cuban stepped up with ""Flowers for the Dead."" If you're a fan of Pun's and want something close (like the generic brand of your favorite cereal) this album is worth the dough. I hate to compare him to this, but his sound is not that far removed from TS or the late, great Pun. I look forward to more releases from Cuban. Keep doing your thing. True fans have your back!"
1,Pure Garbage,I cant believe that some people here love this album. This album is pure garbage. 24k was nice though. I have the bootleg and 24k was a nice album but Chain Reaction is pure garbage and dissapointing. The beats are weak and even the Swizz Beats produced songs are weak. I like Cuban Link his mixtapes are hot stuff but Chain Reaction is wack as hell. Im going to give away my CD to the salvation army.
2,Picture does not match product,Dont get me wrong the product that I did recive is great but it is not what was pictured
4,Judgement Calls,"Just started this book and so far, I am really enjoying it. Bought it because my sister simply loves this author and I am beginning to understand why. Definitely looks like a keeper!"
4,Love Alafair Burke's books.,"Ms. Burke tells a great story. Detailed, informative and always unique. Her characters are easily visualized and real enough not to be annoyingly ""good."" Samantha Kincaid has her ""warts,"" and they make her a more human protagonist."
2,How disappointing,"I have been looking for a new mystery series and saw that the Samantha Kincaid novels had received fairly high reviews, so I ordered this first installment. How disappointing. Dry characters, dull dialog, and a plot that seemed to take forever to set up and resolve. I doubt that I'll be buying any of the other books in the series."
4,reads like the real thing,If you've spent any time inside a DA's office you know Alafair Burke delivers the goods. The story is believable and accurate in tone and detail. The characters seem real and the plot is not some far-fetched Grisham-like fantasy that could never happen in a million years. I enjoyed this book a great deal and have recommended it to several friends. Just because her dad is a legendary writer himself doesn't mean A. Burke doesn't earn her kudos. I am eagerly awaiting her next one.
1,Terrible,This book was one of the worst I have ever read. The characters were not developed and the plot was slow moving resulting in a very boring story. All-in-all it was a waste of time and money.
2,CD won't play in my player (CD-R?),This CD and another by the same artist will not play in my CD player which doesn't read CD-R's. When I play it in a boom box it will work. The songs just don't appeal to my children or our youth group. The song lyrics are well written but the tunes themselves are not catchy to the kids. They seem to like Colin Buchannan's Aussie Praise collection much better. Amazon doesn't sell it but cbd.com does. Great Effort though by this couple.
1,Item came scratched & in generic packaging,"This is the WORST amazon purchase I have ever made. Typically they are so reliable but this was not the case.The CD came in a clear cd case with no paper insert telling us the song names, etc. AND IT WAS SCRATCHED!!!What a waste of money. I am so disappointed."
3,Not Hitachi's best effort,"I've used and admired Hitachi tools for many years, from their 3 hp routers (great, cheap) to nail guns and others, but this one is just OK. The chuck is the worst design flaw as it is keyless, but also very smooth so it is nearly impossible to hold bits tightly by hand tightening the chuck. It has good power, although not exceptional. The batteries seem to last about an average amount of time as well. The belt clip is better than the one on my Makita impact driver (great tool!) and is big enough to actually work with a set of tool bags. However the tool is so bulky and heavy that you don't want to use it hanging from the belt much, although it's nice when you're up on the ladder with nowhere to set the tool down. The reverse switch can be switched accidentally by just gripping the tool, but it's not terrible. The work light hasn't seen any use, but appears to be a good design. I'd go back to Panasonic if I had the chance."
5,like a Joseph Campbell hallucination,"Most books are read for instruction or entertainment. Many challenge the wits or beliefs. Few question our very grasp on reality, or confront us with spiritual dilemma. The fact that the author ended his life prior to publication might place him in the rare club of suicidal artists (John Toole, Ian Curtis, Nick Drake) credited as having revealed a tortured emotion too beautiful to bear.Like Hesse's Steppenwolf, Lindsay manages to draw out manageable manifestations of Jungian archtypes, but his imagery is far more expressive, discarding rather than merely augmenting day to day experience. His prose is not elegant, his sudden story changes are disorienting, and you finally leave the book with the feeling that, perhaps, the author has revealed great truths just beyond grasp.A very fascinating exercise. Very cult worthy."
4,Like a strong narcotic,"A book that sends you to another world is a fantasy. A book that propels you like a cannonball into a surreal world that's like a combination of Dante's Divine Comedy, Burroughs' Naked Lunch and Vance's Planet of Adventure is something altogether different, maybe unnameable. A Voyage to Arcturus is quite simply a metaphysical voyage to an incredibly alien landscape that raises in its forms both the questions and the answers about the nature of reality, our perceptions, our senses (especially as regards to pleasure and pain) and role of God in all those layers of reality. Hints of Gnosticism, Calvinism, asceticism and hedonism waft across the pages of this tale like a fine perfume.Prepare to be amazed, horrified and bewildered by the sights you will see, the landscapes you will tread, and the parts of your mind that will open. A remarkable work only weakened somewhat by a rather superfluous beginning and some awkward phrasing."
2,"Typical Epic Voyage, Mostly Nonsense","Read on a recommendation, I have no idea what anyone could see in this book. For the most part, the main character is just going from place to place having brief adventures that present obvious moral characteristics. Each little adventure is quickly left behind and forgotten, simply because the main character has a compulsion to head North. Its a poorly strung collection of nearly unrelated events that culminates in, what a bit of reading has clarified for me, is a poor expression of some very ancient and ridiculous religious ideas (gnosticism, as it turns out--if you don't think its fair to call a religious sort of idea ridiculous, read about gnosticism before you get upset). Sure, Lindsay describes some crazy environments, but come on, we all have imaginations, there's nothing too special there either."
4,Every review of value.,"Those who read it during their ""formatory"" years were left with an indelible imprint, some remembering the characters and scenes decades after reading this book. The same can be said for PK Dick's ""Ubik"" and ""Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"" among others. To review Arcturus in any other way (eg literary) would be like a chemist reviewing an excellent wine from a chemist perspective without ever tasting it. As someone once said ""there is a difference between knowing and knowing about."" Regarding the movie suggestion, maybe Tim Burton could pull it off."
3,A Voyage to Arcturus,"Found the book interesting in its fanstastic world,the description of the planet and its inhabitant was different. But at the same time hard to follow the plot and its meaning."
2,"Great book, terrible edition","This is an excellent book, one I have read many times. Five stars for the story. Never have I read it in such a garbled edition, though. Zero stars to Bison Books. Chapter one (which was as far as I got) contained ten typos, some actually changing the meaning of what was going on (""turned and confronted the party"" becomes ""turned and _comforted_ the party"".) If you haven't read Arcturus, you'll just be confused by textual errors in what is already a demanding book. Nice cover, though."
3,Not as good as some reviews led me to believe,"It's a kind of Pilgrim's Progress from a pagan point of view, which means that while there are some compelling parts, the plot falls apart by the end, becoming downright nonsensical by the end of the book. There are also too many mysteries, which are not solved, leaving the reader wondering what was the point of bringing up some of these things. All in all, rather disappointing, unless you are doing a study on how religious attitudes affect people's thinking."
3,A Voyage to Wherever you want to go.,"Very old, very British, supposedly combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. I think the writer was a partaker of opium or some other good drugs of the time. Not unlike Alice in Wonderland and jumping from here to there. I was exhausted by the time I finished it and was glad to be done with it. Whew! Read it if you must. It was a torturous read for me but I was obliged to finish it."
1,Not worth the money.,"This review is for the Fruit of the Loom V-neck Tee shirt.Horrible, horrible product. Fabric is so thin you can see right through it. Yellowed and dingy colored. Ugh.My worst online purchase this year."
3,"High quality, high shrinkage","The shirts are a high quality that last through multiple washings, keeping a bright white color and not fraying. Washed about 5 times so far. The problem with the shirts is that they shrink a lot after washing. I got the large, which seemed too big and returned them for mediums which fit perfect when first tried on. After washing them they fit like baby t's on a woman. They went from a few inches below my belt line to just touching my beltline at the edges. I'd be willing to buy the large and see what happens after washing, but only from a store where I could easily return them for an exchange."
4,husbands,"Husbands never like to shop! Mine however was happy when we used a gift card he got to buy his favorite underwear on line because it is what he always gets and likes and he could do it in minutes and it shipped right away. He was happy and I did not have to endure grumpy man in the store. He has worn this brand for many years but he wants to pick it out himself(like it will be different if I do it), so he was confident buying it. Good product."
3,Basic shirts,"They are great until you wash 'em.They shrunk quite a bit after washing and drying. I don't use the dryer in the summer months, but during the cooler time of year I have to. They kind of expose my husbands belly now. Before they fit great. He still wears them, but I should have picked a size too big."
2,Quality of undershirt,"Frankly I was disappointed with the quality of a ""Fruit of the Loom"" product. I expected a better texture. Guess that's what one should expect of imported goods. My bad I guess........."
3,nice legs - shame about the face,"This is a well laid out attractive book. It is obvious that alot of work has gone in to it.You can tell the Thinkers Press take alot of pride in their books.. What is disappointing is the opening itself. I knew little of this opening before I got the book..the statistics given for the variation 1/d4 Nf6 2/Nc3 d5 3/Bg5 c5 gives, based on 159 games, 25 % wins for white and 40 % for black ! Not very encouraging for a supposed repatoire weapon"
5,I loved it,"I'm a comedian, and thought this book was a hoot. But the joy in this book is that it isn't for comedians...it's for anybody who wants to think like one.Jay has the brainy side that makes you think differently, and I loved it. And Karyn is funny. It's a great value...easy to read. Go for it!"
5,An excellent guide not only for aspiring comedians,"Jay Arthur is a master practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Karyn Ruth White is a standup comedian and professional speaker. In Your Seventh Sense: How To Think Like A Comedian these two quite diverse experts work together to offer the reader an introduction of the essential skills required to ""think like a comedian"". Chapters address how to hone one's comedy radar, learning to refine one's act before taking it public, transforming random ideas into belly-laugh gold, and much more. Each two-page spread offers solid advice on one page, and a humorous or inspirational comedy-related quote on the other. An excellent guide not only for aspiring comedians, but also for those seeking to learn just enough of the art to liven up their speeches and presentations."
4,An ideal book for future stand-up comedians.,I enjoyed this book thoroughly.Both authors explain everything in simple English.Nothing boring here.The are many ideas in this book to help develop more material.The book holds your attention and the jokes throughout are enjoyable.This is a definite book that you should add to your collection if stand-up comedy is your goal.
3,Interesting Workout,"I am only rating this a 3 star because it is a very mild workout, but I still found it enjoyable and perfect for a light day or to tack on to a more energetic one. The DVD claims to be sending subliminal messages in the music, but since they are subliminal, I am unaware of them. This instructor is very low-keyed but very likeable. He has two other Mind Fitness Workouts which I liked better--one is a walking workout and one is a fitness workout, which is the most intense out of the three. All three workouts have a nine-minute bonus of great relaxing music--that almost puts you to sleep."
3,It's a wonderful game!,"This was as realistic as fishing gets. I have other fishing games and by far, this is my most favorite. The graphics are terrific."
1,For the Completist Egan Fan Only,"I hate to say it, but I was very disappointed with this and the other two releases from The Brooklyn Cowboys. I am a huge fan of Walter Egan's solo projects and of his work in his surf band The Malibooz. In my opinion, his 1999 solo album ""Walternative,"" with its eclectic mix of musical styles, is nothing short of a masterpiece. But this album just lacks any appeal for me. Song titles like ""Wishful Drinking"" lead me to believe that this album had potential, but the instrumentation is less than inspiring and the vocals also leave something to be desired.If, like me, you are interested in this album because of a love for the music of Walter Egan, you might want to think twice. My advice for the Egan fan: buy this one only if you are a completist."
2,Nothing New Here,"This band does nothing that hasn't been done before, and better, by many other bands. I was disappointed and would not recommend this CD to my friends. Maybe this is what passes for ""country"" music in Brooklyn but here in Texas it's just noise."
4,"Strong Content, A fine novel","First book I have read by Mr. Smith I will certainly read more. The story is very strong in the fiber of Japan, its ways, the peoples feelings, and the time embarrassing as it was to the beginning of the War. It was stated and seemed to be fact that they always knew they could not win, but face caused them to fight to the last. Harry, the main character moves through the story in a slippery way as he was more Asian than American but in his heart he also knew there wasn't a chance to win. I will now begin my oddesey of reading all his books. He is a fine Novelist."
3,A decent read,This is the first book of Martin Cruz Smith that I have read and overall I would say that the book was pretty good. The sequences of flashbacks was a little too much for me and at times I almost forgot what time period we were in.The story was very well done and made you question the main characters character many times over. Even at this point I wonder if he was a good guy or just another thief.I will read another Smith book again.
4,Very Good!,"Well done thriller that offers a deep understanding of Japanese culture during the years leading up to Pearl Harbor. Great atmosphere, sharply etched characters, and superb dialog. The plot is fascinating and there are no punches pulled regarding Japanese savagery in China. Highly recommended."
2,Not up to his usual!,"If there's a bigger Martin Cruz Smith fan around than your's truly I'd like to meet them. I sacrifice budget or food in the house when he has a new release. Maybe that's why I felt so let down when I finished DECEMBER 6TH.Another review nailed it. Casablanca goes to Japan! Thirty or so pages into this the comparison was way obvious. To me there's nothing worse than taking a classic storyline and trying to disguise it as something new.I wanted this to end. I didn't want POLAR STAR, RED SQUARE, or HAVANA BAY to end. ROSE well ... let's leave ROSE alone. It wilted OK?In so many other works by Smith I felt the chill of ice, smelled the cabbage boiling. I could see the colors of Cuba! Here, not only was it already familiar but it was almost a draft instead of a complete work.Bring back Arkady. He is a never miss character and always brings depth to the story.Sorry Martin. Maybe DECEMBER 6TH won't live in infamy."
2,Not Gorky Park with Sushi!,"I guess I was expecting a Japanese, day before Pearl Harbor, Gorky Park. It wasn't. The problem with this book is that it did not hold my attention. I went back and reread more pages than in any book other than Michael Crichton's. In fact when I finished it I really could not tell you what it was about beyond ... the day before Pearl Harbor.Buy it if you have insomnia."
1,"I wanted to like it, but couldn't get through it","About half way through I decided that it was going in circles, so I skipped to the end to see if it was worth trudging on through it. The ending left the whole thing up in the air, without any real resolution."
1,Can't expect much for historical accuracy,"In Tokyo, the day before Pearl Harbor was December 7. If the author cannot muster an historically correct title, what can you expect in the text?"
4,Mr. Smith Does His Homework,"I've always enjoyed Smith's books because they immerse you in a new world. He paints word pictures of a place and time so vivid that you actually seem to know them. This isn't just praise of Smith's writing expertise (although that is great) but of his incredible research talent. He must totally immerse himself in a historical environment before he puts a word on paper.I knew little about pre-war Japan before reading ""December 6"". With a fast-paced plot and Japan-raised American Harry Niles as guide, I was whisked through a crash course in Japanese history, culture, and psychology. Like most historical fiction, it requires some suspension of disbelief (gee, how DID Harry bump into all of the key figures in Japan that day?). I find so few books that so convince me of their time and place that I'll willingly ignore some plot contrivances."
3,Mixed Bag,"Surprising deriviative of Casablanca, perhaps unnecessarily so, it still works as a unique--if somewhat turgid--insight into a fascinating culture.One person's ""complicated"" is another's ""convoluted."" The setting is never less than interesting, but the narrative is never quite satisfactory. The dialogue is unbelieveable at best, often belabored, and the plot's gimmick is telegraphed to anyone with a knowledge of Pearl Harbor. The prescience of the novel's key characters to universally agree that Japan will lose the war--literally 12 hours after the attack--is, well, ludicrous. But how else to make the ending play?Worth the read, but overpraised by critics. Smith has done better."
1,Deception,"Amazon also sells this book under the title ""Tokyo Station."" They won't tell you this, and if you order the book and you've read ""Tokyo Station"" and complain to Amazon, you'll be told you should have read pages from inside the book before ordering. This, I imagine, will be true for other books published under more than one title. So beware."
3,Okay,"An often interesting novel, but with Smith trying often unsuccessfully, and too hard, to be ""literary."" The similes and descriptions are often very awkward. It's basically a ""Casablanca"" in Japan: an expatriate American who owns a nightclub with no apparent loyalty to anyone, and has a plane to catch to get out of the s__tstorm before it hits the fan. With some good moments."
1,Boring,"Seems the writer wrote it with an eye of selling it as a source for a movie script. Poorly written and extremely poor characterization that float in a boat full of holes and unfortunately it is the reader who drowns. Pure Trash, waste of time and money!!! I wish I had given it a negative mark and a tap on the writer's knuckles. Is he still alive? His Gorky Park was good, though!"
5,this lens helped out in an air show!,"I recently went to an air show and used the TC-DC-58C lens. I got great, crisp shots! The clarity loses nothing while the zooming abilities gain everything! I would recommend this lens to any amateur who wishes to be a semi-,halfway-decent-, quasi-professional!Be aware that the lens is bulky, but this should be obvious to the consumer before buying. Because of its size, it limits the ability to use the viewfinder."
3,Great for Outdoors but terrible for indoor photos,This lens works very well outdoors or when there is a lot of light but is terrible indoors and takes very dark grainy photos. The photos taken outside with full sun exposure were very good though. Another problem is that for closer subjects you will see a circle in the center of your photo until you zoom out enough to move past this circle.
4,TC-DC58C - Excellent Lens,"Just purchased this lens a month or so ago, and used it on vacation and a few other events. Overall, very happy with the lens. Sturdy and good weight to it - just what you would expect from a Canon lens. As I had read in other reviews prior to my purchase, the built in flash of my G9 cannot be used with the lens due to the shadows produced, so this is really limited to outdoor use (or a large indoor space with good lighting). Due to the weight of the lens, a tripod is helpful in keeping the camera still. I have used the tripod and some of the pictures have been amazing (sunrises, swim meet, baseball game). Would recommend to others."
2,i thought canon can do better than that,"for the money i paid i thought im getting better than this thing, pretty heavy, and can be done without it. and a big mistake never zoom out cause you will get a black circle around your subject."
3,Preschool software,"I reviewed other people's responses to their experiences with this software and had decided to purchase based upon all of the praise. To my disappointment, this program is very simplistic for my 3 year old to enjoy, and my 1 year old is also bored rather quickly with the games too. I don't think this program should have it's high ratings."
4,Life,"My first time through Crooked, I wasn't astonished, but I was satisfied. The thing I was most surprised about, was how the author had perfectly made a teenager's life. I can relate to many of the things the characters went through, and I think the realisticness of the book should deserve a 4 out of 5 stars."
4,Crookedness,"My review on this book is that it is a decent book, what's not to like about it? Nothing really,except for the fact that it has it's ups and downs. This book is pretty well thought out,the ending could of had a little more effort put into it but other than that it was great. The book was a long read but it was well worth it. The whole deal about the Tripp brothers going after Amos and Clara just creeps me out. I think that this book kind of relates to the real world stuff in a way unlike those sci-fi ones. As far as I know, I would like to continue reading more books by this author, especially if there is an extension or a sequel to this book."
4,Crooked Review: Not too shabby,"I recently read the book ""Crooked"", and after finishing it I found it to be somewhat of a let down. Although the book was well written, I thought that the ending could have been a lot better. After all that had happened in the book I expected something a little more sad and depressing to happen in the ending, but what ended up happening was not like the rest of the book. The ending was like a more happy state than anything else, it didn't really set the tone in the end of the book."
3,Crooked Review,"I have read the book Crooked, and I enjoyed it very much. I loved the way Clara's happenings were based on real life stories, and how Amos had encountered such a hard time with his father passing away. But one thing that fastenated me about the book Crooked was everyting that happened in the book has actually happened to someone in the world. I mean you'd never think about how many teenagers lose their fathers at a young age, or how many tennage girls are tricked into having sexual relationships with boys. I know for a fact that their are people getting bullied out there right now. But over all, what fascinates me about the book was how every big plot was based on real life, and I loved it!"
2,could't finish it,"I tried and tried with this book, getting more than half way through before just giving up. A father dies of cancer and the children (age 15 and 17+) scarcely know or care that he is sick. And he is a nice guy, a real nice guy. The police don't take kids seriously when they come in the day after their father's funeral to report that someone broke into their house and left a dead snake in the jello! And this is shortly after the same kid was slugged in the face with a baseball bat and spent time in the hospital. Uh............"
2,Don't judge a book by its cover...,"...which I did, and imprudently based my initial thoughts upon it, instead of the back or jacket cover or anything of logic.It wasn't a bad book, explicitly, but it definitely wasn't a good one, either. Crooked was merely just okay, with kind of under-developed characters and a rather lame plotline involving milk and kids from the bad side of the tracks. Was there a gun? I can't remember, but there was a break-in and hiding in the attic.It has a cool cover, though."
4,deliciously crooked,"Clara has a crooked nose, the Tripp brothers are crooks, life in general is ""crooked"". This was a long book and Laura and Tom McNeal did a wonderful job guiding the book along, gently. The book does not seem too long to tie up the loose ends it just completes itself. I was pleased, but I am a quote gatherer and there were no quotes that jumped out at me this time. A great read in all other respects."
5,A Great Teen Read,"The book Crooked is a great read. It is about two students in high school, named Amos Mackenzie and Clara Wilson, whose lives become a thrilling rollercoaster ride after they meet each other. They try to avoid the Tripp brothers, and avoid other problems in their troubled life, including love and hatred.I really liked this book because it always kept you on the edge of your seat and you could really get into it. Crooked has many mysteries and strange twists within the story that keep you asking for more. This books genre is probably mystery and it is the best mystery I've ever read. I would recommend the book Crooked to anyone over thirteen."
4,Crooked- Book Review,"I give this a book 4 stars for a couple of reasons. First, I really like how the authors switch the perspective in each chapter. For example: They talk about Amos and what is happening with him, and then the next chapter they are talking about Clara, and what is happening with her. Both the lives are connected, so it makes it not too hard to follow even with the switched view.I liked the problem, and solution of the book. I like how everything is related, and how it all comes together in the end. It really makes the book interesting!Overall, I really liked this book. The story was a good one, the way it was put together.., it was all great! I just wouldn't give it a 5 star because I have to REALLY love a book for that, and there were some parts that I didn't really like! For example, I didn't like how the story went on and on. It wasn't bad though, since most of the time it wasn't boring. It wasn't PERFECT, though it was a good book!"
2,Don't be fooled,"The reviews for this book are fantastic and the back of the book makes you want to dive into the book head first. Its reviews state it was written in the perspective of two teenagers who find solace in each other after a series of misfortuante events in their lives. To be frank, this book has absolutely no flow. The characters suddenly go from strangers to friends. The language and dialogue is defintely not how a teenager would sound or feel. The reviews of this book are a misrepresentation. AS well, the writing is definitely 180 degrees away from a real teens POV."
5,A heart warming story for people of all ages!,"Even though I am well beyond the ninth grade, I found this book to be utterly delightful. It captured the very essence of my tumultous teenage years filled with insecurities and confusion. Although I did not suffer from a crooked nose, as Clara did, I could feel her pain in my remembrance of (perceived) physical defects with which I had to bear. I, too, wanted desperately to have friendships with classmates who treated me poorly, yet, I persisted in pursuing their approval. Throughout the book, I found that I could easily identify with the struggles with which Clara, Amos, and Bruce had to deal, whether they were with family tragedies, school issues, or peer pressure. And in the end, I was reminded of the true essence of beauty and personal worth, which brought a smile to my face and to my heart. I eagerly await future works from the McNeals!"
3,Survey of Accounting,I would have understood the work better if the basics would have been in the begining instead of having to find it in the back of the book. It still doesn't go into much detail before you start your assignments.
1,Awful excuse for accounting.,I have taken various accounting courses in the past and this is by all means the less comprehensive book I've used. Do not purchase unless NECESSARY for a class.
1,Garbage!,Don't buy this product. The battery lasted a few weeks before dying. It also produced a strange tasting residue the seemed to mix with the toothpaste. This product is absolute junk! Do yourself a favour and get something more expensive and reliable.
4,The Morning Melody,"I was really moved on hearing the chanting here and this one compares far superior to the Om namah shivaay chanting. It is a great buy,"
5,one of the best albums i have out of thousand that own,i have a huge colection in rasta music and this is one of the best i have Larry Marshal is one of the best singers that Jamaica has produce i higly recomend this album to any one that really loves rasta music.LATINRASTA1
5,Counterfeit Gelt is Pure Gold,Don't let the title of this album fool you. There's nothing counterfeit about it--just pure originality that will keep you wanting more. Can't wait for their next album!
1,DOES NOT WORK!,Don't waste your time or money or valueables on this stuff.I sprayed it all over my dogs bed to the point it was DRENCHED!She started chewing on it within hours of being left alone.She even held the bed in her mouth for several minutes!Maybe some dogs don't prefer grapefruit skin but others will most likely be not phased by it.
3,I enjoyed this book,"I takes me a long time read a book because of my schedule, so when the book came in the mail, it took me two weeks to finish it. The book tells a story of a master vampire who has children, wow cool idea. I enjoyed the pace and characters very much and would like to see more from this author. I looked for his website and sent him an email to get my book signed now I am waiting for it come back to me. It was nice to get to speak with the author and not an assistant. Thanks"
5,This ones for the WORLD....,I would like to say for a new author I was impressed. IT was clear from the onset that this writer has an extrememly fertile imagination. I read the prologue and was hooked. I will follow this aurthor should he write another book it should be interesting to see him grow into his craft. I applaud his efforts and the fact that he brought to life another realm of vampires like I have never read. I have since passed this copy on to my mother and she too is finding the depth and bredth of the work fascinating and readable. She reads much more than I so I cannot wait for her to tell me her full opinion. Here is to what I call a job well done.
5,One AWESOME BOOK!!!,"Don't take my word for it, buy it, read it. YOU CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! It keeps you reading, and makes you want MORE!!! Absolutely an awesome book!"
2,HOPE FOR BETTER,"I FOUND THE BOOK A LITTLE ON THE BORING SIDE. IT HAD A LOT OF FLIGHT OF IDEAS, A PARAGRAH MIGHT HAVE ONE IDEA THEN THE NEXT PARAGRAH ANOTHER THOUGHT AND BACK TO ANOTHER IDEA. A LOT OF HOMOSEXUALITY, DAD SLEEPING WITH THIS SON. NOT TO MENTION IN THE BEGININNG THE FATHER MALCOM KIDNAPS HIS KIDS AND IMPRISON THEM IN AWFUL SETTINGS, ONLY LATER TO ANNOUCE HE IS A VAMPIRE AND THEY JUST EMBRASS HIM. THE BOOK DID NOT HOLD ONE EXCITING MOMENT AND THE AUTHOR WAS UNABLE TO PULL THE STORY LINE TOGEHER. OH YES THERE WAS SEVERAL TYPE-O'S."
1,The Worst Book Ever,"I was incredibly disappointed after reading this book, because the synopsis made it seem interesting and it was far from it. In fact, it was so poorly written that I had trouble getting past all the unnecessary sexual undertones and bad editing to get interested in the book. This is the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life, and I do not recommend it."
5,Extremely Riveting,"This is one book I read from beginning to end, Captivated by the twists and turns.The content kept my attention as the story unfolded. I look forward to the sequel book."
4,Vivid from beginning to end!,"The books opens with Ethen slugglishly driving home from a long day a parity everyone can identify with. When someone or something enters his room and is there to kidnap him fear erodes his emotional balance and sets in motion a spellbinding novel with strong character driven to make you want to read. I can't wait to see where these characters go from here, truly a nice job."
4,HOT HOT HOT...,Where has Sarah and Ethen been all my life. I moved thorugh this book like the wind. Malcolm my man is the hero and I so look forward to more about him and this new coven of vampires.
1,Glad it's only a memory...,"This has to be the most poorly written, sophomoric vampire book ever published. And how it ever got published is a complete mystery. I managed to read only three chapters before giving up in disgust. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and thought I had maybe not given the writer enough of a chance -- although I got the impression that all of the reviews were written by the same person using different names. So I read another three chapters -- a total waste of 10 minutes. My advice? Save your money. There are some super vampire books out there. This just isn't one of them."
1,I'm sure the author is a nice guy but...,"Unfortunately this book is badly written, excruciatingly so. It has some good ideas but they are laid out as if the author was making a list rather than communicating his ideas to the reader. Maybe a good editor and a couple of rewrites could have fixed it, I don't know. I read a lot of paranormal stuff and I usually finish any book I start, including some pretty mediocre romances and science fiction, but this one...I just couldn't do it. Sorry, it's going straight to the book swap - maybe someone else can enjoy it."
4,BETTER THAN AVERAGE.,"I think vampies rock, totally. My sister hit me up with this book for my b-day and she was right on target. The vamps and witches and shifters kept me glued to my chair until the last word was read. I have read most of the big names and this story was original and reeled into the world of Malcolm and his children of the night. Although alot of people think of vampires and the stories that go with them as merely heartless killers that was just not the case here, not only is the storyline unique, this is the first time I have ever read about vampires such as these. I was happy when my internet searches turned up information on the upcoming book in this series. I anxiously await the return of Malcolm. Kudos to this first time author."
2,missing pages,Book seemed like it was in good condition when I got it. But when I had to do the lab report in class I quickly realized all the lab report pages had all been torn out.
5,Remembering an Amnesiac,"These two biographers have done a superb job reconstructing a life that Oscar himself was content (for an audience) to remember with zingers and one-liners. Anyone who has read Levant's hugely popular, now out of print, memoirs, knows that Oscar Levant was a sad, strange man with a razor wit and many compulsions and addictions. Perhaps this book's greatest gift is to show that he was also a decent, even sweet and thoughtful, man of great musical talent who deserves remembering."
5,JT drops something crucial,This CD is something crucial cuz JT drops wisdom from the street perspective. He's got something on there for everybody -- whether just mobbin or buildin with the brothas from the block. You'll want to copp this CD and listen to it very closely... It's bangin!
1,"Could Have Been 5-Stars, But....","Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this game UNLESS you have a computer that runs faster than 450mhz, has better than a 3Dfx Voodoo 4 4500 video card, and has more than 128mb of RAM. Because that's exactly what I have, and I have to turn all the graphic settings down so low the sky and grandstands are just black, the track is solid grey, and the cars would hardly give an Atari 2600 a run for it's money for it to run even somewhat smoothly. 'NASCAR Heat' has 5-times better graphics, better controls, better EVERYTHING... and runs like a dream on my computer with all the settings at their highest!!!"
4,I passed!,"The CD did not work - I was using my work pc and the disc required that it make ""changes to my computer."" I was unable to allow this since I did not have administrative rights to my machine.So I had to do the questions in the book. It worked though and I passed the exam. Several people told me that the only way to pass this exam is to do lots of practice exams. This worked for me (on the second attempt at taking the test.)"
3,Good Study guide,"Include this as one of your study guides for the test and you get a better understand, and the cram sheet is outstanding!"
1,Piece of Trash,"I got this book for free as a hand-out at a conference, or I would be really steamed. I did the first 50 questions or so and found no less than 3 questions that were either wrong or completely nonsense. Don't waste money on this, just a warning. I'm frustrated by the amount of time I wasted on this. I wish I could cut and paste from the question I have on my screen right now.Basically it says ""some guy takes office supplies for his kids school. Has Ralph violated the code of ethics"".Ok, fine question, but the answer it gives as correct is:#3 - No, everyone walks off with a pen from time-to-time.Then, the explanation for why that is correct is almost unreadable. It then says says #4 is incorrect, but then proceeds to explain why it is correct... mind boggling. In the book, I foudn the same question and it is worded in a different way, but equally unintelligible.Avoid this horrible, horrible product."
1,Out of date.,"Unless you would like to spend time studying for a version of the PMP exam that PMI no longer administers, stay away from this book (Practice Questions). I will verify what a few others have stated concerning the poor quality of the questions and the ironically spotty quality control in the product, but most relevant to my mind is that it deals with (some) topics that are no longer dealt with in the 3rd edition of the PMBOK. There are much better practice question options out there, but you may have to pay a little more for them."
2,Bad and Confusing Questions - Avoid this book,"Here are the list of problems with this book1. Very confusing and ambiguous questions2. Some of the answers are plain wrong3. The CD based testing software is defective. I specifically found- The time keeping piece doesn't work on Windows XP for customized tests- The answers on some questions were mixed upOverall, I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about the PMP exam. There are several other soures that I found, that have better questions and which are less confusing/more in line with the PMP exam questions"
2,Inadequate for New PMP Exam,"This book is a waste of money for the new PMP exam. Some of the questions/answers are poorly worded, while some contain flaws in logic. More important, some questions and answers are simply not correct for the new PMP exam. The questions are too general and not directly referenced to the PMBOK - that alone is a warning signal - absolutely no references to the PMBOK to support the author's answers. Warning: This book is not written for the new PMP exam given after October 2005. Pay a little more and get a more complete PMP prep book. I spent money on this book and feel very, very cheated."
2,Subpar,"Many questions written poorly, in a very confusing language, useless info abundant. As other reviewers pointed out, some of the answers belong with different questions (both in the book and on the CD), some answers are clearly incorrect.Most irritating part to me was that some ""correct"" answers were arrived at by using this pseudo-PMI logic that was used sparingly ONLY (i.e., that very same logic was not applied in other similar questions.)I've used Exam Cram 2 with great confidence to pass 8 other tests. This is the worst one in the series by far, which points to either the writer or inadequate/incompetent editing."
2,press,"This is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. If you are ironing a large shirt you have to push it into the ""storage area"" and pull it through after each press. It still leaves wrinkles and puckers. By the time you pull the rest of the shirt through it is sitting in your lap getting wrinkles again. Would not recommend. If I was smart I would have kept the box and would be taking it back. It is still very time consuming. I will stick with a regular iron."
1,NOT the book!,"Don't be fooled! This is not the actual book! I ordered this for my niece thinking it was a cheaper version of the book--maybe a paperback. What I got is ""Scholastic Skills Through Literature Reproducible Activities."" 16 pages of writing prompts and other language arts activities that are loosely linked to the book, i.e., a contractions worksheet, a plurals worksheet, a punctuation worksheet, and a homophones worksheet, to name a few. If this is what you're looking for, then by all means.... But don't make the same mistake I did! I'm sending it back, tout suite!"
1,Limited scope,Got a subscription for one free year when I subscribed to another magazine. If you're into sportbikes it's fine. If you're a cruiser rider you're all but forgotten.
1,What a hassel !,Bought a renewal for my motorcycle magazine. They said they would extend my current subscription. Then I recieved a notice for my new subctription.I phoned the company and explained that I wanted the renewal at the end of my current subscription. I have not recieved any issues at all.
5,good product for the $,I had the old model in the 1990's this one is just as great. You save a lot of money and room not buying the different products seperately.
1,Worst gift I've ever recieved!,"I really hoped this would have worked, but unfortunately it was a let down. I have mildly curly and thick hair (but not coarse). I straighten my hair almost daily. I tried all the tools and still hated it! It doesn't even get hot, even when left for about 10 minutes. The straightener SUCKS! The crimper is even worse...no matter how long you hold it, how small the section of hair, or even the amount of hairspray put in before using it....it wouldn't do the job...just wave it the tiniest....making it look like my natural hair anyway. The curlers aren't impressing either. Seriously, I'm better off using my mother's hair tools from the 80s.....I would throw this thing out, but my mother bought me this for Christmas only a couple months ago."
1,Not what I ordered,"The picture and what I received are two different things. What I really wanted was the 1/2"" spiral curling iron. The item I received did not even have a spiral curling iron. So I returned it !!!!"
2,Bad performance with the straight hair,"It doest warm up with the tool for straight hair, and the plate for it is too short, actually I believe is not good enough for the price i paid for it"
2,"Good Concept, Poor Product.","The concept of this 3-in-1 set is a great idea, but this particular design works so poorly that it's not even worth fighting with to use. It doesn't get hot enough to actually straighten or curl your hair, and so is basically useless."
3,cheap,"my daughter is happy thats what matters ,,,, .... ,,,,, .... ,,,,, ...... ,,,,, ..... ,,,, ..... ,,,, .... ,,,"
1,Cheezy,This is for kids. It does not heat up enough to make a curl. Should have known by the price. Going to give it to my 12 year old niece.
2,not heat fast,"I love the color and the removable parts but they can be hard to take off and fit on at times. Its also not heating up fast enough for me, i usually have a few minutes to get out so i cant wait for it to heat up and style."
2,attachments not good,"i bought this for the spiral attachment and it came made of plastic, does not spiral at all.curling iron does get hot fast but have no luck using any of the attachments."
3,Not Hot Enough,"Product works okay, it just doesnt get hot enough to perform each function well. It would be fine for a child, or someone to ""practice"" doing hair."
1,Don't waste your money!,Won't get hot enough to crimp my 3 year old thin hair! Won't get hot at all! Total waste of money!
1,Don't purchase this item!,"I do not recommend this item to anyone. I received this item, and I was very excited to use it. I opened the package, and plugged the crimper part to it first plugged it up, and it didn't work! I was shocked! I then plugged the curler part to it, & it did not work. I opened up the crimper, and realized the part that I needed to heat it up was missing for the crimper. I was very upset! I would not reccomend it you would b better off paying a good bit money for a nice one that will work than a one that want work at all."
1,Doesn't wave or crimp,"It took forever for this to warm up and when it did, it didn't crimp at all. I may give it another try...my daughter was so excited to get this but disappointed that it didn't make her hair wavy.I'll most likely be returning it if they let me. The packaging is the plastic kind you actually have to take scissors and cut into. No salvaging the packaging on this one!"
2,Depending on your use...,"I bought this product primarily for straightening my hair (my hair is naturally just slightly wavy). I found that it did this very poorly. In fact, I purchased a new straightener within a week of this one. However, my friend bought the same item and used it for curling, waving, and some crimping. It does a good job of this, especially given the price. Overall, definitely a good product for the price, however, if your main use is going to be straightening I would recommend searching for a new product (I have found that a ceramic straightener by Ceramix has been a terrific investment)."
1,DO NOT buy this set!!!!!,"I am highly disappointed in this set. I bought it as a gift for my daughter who has been wanting one forever. She opened this up, plugged it in and waited about 10 minutes thinking it would heat up hot enough to crimp her hair. She tried it and it did hardly anything. I checked the iron and It was barely warm. I was actually able to hold on to the plates that should have been hot with ease. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this thing... Worthless. I am happy that Amazon has a good return policy :) Yeah Amazon! I am off to look for a REAL crimper LOL"
1,Dont buy this item,"I was so excited to get this item, but when i got it i plugged it in, and it didnt get hot AT ALL! this was a waste of 25.00 dollars."
1,LEFT COLD,"I was very excited to get this unfortunately it just don't work. It doesn't heat up so it wont straighten my hair, just kind of tugs on it leaving it looking very frizzy, but not as frizzy as the crimper makes my hair look. Heat is very important! I haven't even tried the curling iron."
1,Waste of $20,"This thing was a waste of $20. It's a piece of crap. It doesn't get hot enough to do anything; actually, it barely gets warm at all. I just stuck my hand right on the heating plates and they were mildly warm, that's it. Great idea, just doesn't work. Based on the reviews I've seen it seems really hit-or-miss whether it heats up properly. Don't buy it."
2,My experience,I bought this a long time ago from k-mart and it didn't work to well with my hair. I had to set the heat to high and leave whatever tool I was using for a long time. It didn't really straighten or crimp my hair to well. It curled my hair fine but as I said I had to leave it there for a long time. Oh and it takes awhile to heat up. I reccommend finding a better brand possibly and not one that looks like a toy O_O
2,Doesn't work very well.,Purchased this for my daughters hair. One has thick hair and one has fine hair. This item did not work for either or hold a curl. It does not get very hot. Ended up donating it.
2,uuugghh,"Could have bought this item at my local dollar store! Super cheap attachments that do not work well! The spiral curler doesnt spiral (and I have easy-curl hair that measures down to my butt) the curling iron itself is very cheaply designed, not very high quality and would only be good for a young girl who maybe just starting out...a training iron if-u-will hahaha... not for women who know better!"
1,Does not perform,This is the worst product I have ever purchased. My daughter used her christmas gift card to buy this because she wanted to be able to crimp and curl her hair. The item does not heat up and it takes at least and hour just to crimp her hair. Wish I still had the original packaging so I could send it back. This product is a rip-off.
2,Not what I ordered,This picture is misleading. The picture shows two separate metal pieces for the regular iron and the spiral iron. What I got was the other picture listed... a plastic piece that attaches to the regular iron for the spiral. I can't see how it is going to work. My daughter just opened so not sure how it is going to work yet.
2,hhmmm...,I was very excited about getting this because I had one as a kid. But unfortunatly this does not seem to get that hot. But it was for my 6 year old so she enjoyed it!
2,review,"Its a nice price, but it takes a really long time heat up and is not as effective as i would have guessed. I should have just bought a regular crimper."
5,gift,THis is the perfect gift for any fashion diva 9 year old at an awesome price. SHe is sure to love it
3,Good enough for 13 year old,Purchased for 13 year old girl and it works ok. She likes it and that's all that matters to her. I as an adult would not use or purchase for myself .It doesn't get extremely hot or crimp all that well but You get what you pay for!
1,Review,"It doesnt heat up its defective flat iron from conair if i knew how to send it back i would gladly . I dnt recommend anyone to buy it , its a waste of money."
1,Doesn't crimp very well,When crimping the hair you have to sqeeze the barrel to get it to work. Does not heat up very well.Not worth the money or the time!
2,its ok,Love the curling iorn hate the rest..no temp controle just low and high.. i probably wouldn't recommend it and the krimper is super tiny
4,Good,Got this for my husband for anniversery. It fits great in F250 n looks great. So far holds up... The screws went n at n angle for him
5,The Ne Plus Ultra of Modern European Historiography!,"A. J. P. Taylor's book is the sine qua non for university students of European history. This is the real deal: Taylor was a genuine historian who never went further than his facts--and his facts are incredibly well researched, well documented, and bountiful. This is true historiography: the way history ought to be done! Plus, Taylor writes very well, in a lively and entertaining fashion. He has good language, wit, and trenchant observations.It must be noted that this is a history of diplomacy--with some political and military of necessity treated. What does this mean? Well, it means that the characters of Taylor's book are mostly forgotten professional diplomats, and therefore most of their names won't be familiar to those unschooled in modern European history--Bismarck and Disraeli excepted. But this esoterica only increases the value of Taylor's work; for it reveals these forgotten characters to us once again: a gem of historical literature."
1,Mistaken identity leads to romance between prof and mechanic,"Salier's first romance effort falls far short of the standard in the industry. Lackluster plot (psychology professor interviews men on their sexual habits and falls in love with one of her subjects, an auto mechanic masquerading as a multi-millionaire)is further hampered by one-dimensional characters and excruciating dialogue (""Obviously, I have called at an off-color moment."") The narrative reads like a spoof of a very bad romance novel...but it's not a spoof. The Sex Test--alas!--is for real! [Deserves NO stars!]"
2,"Authors, Please Check for Errors Before Publishing!","There are several errors in this textbook that cause the student to make mistakes when attempting to follow the instructions as written. My instructor told us to ""use the pictures and do what looks best rather than follow the instructions."" You've got to be kidding!"
4,Slow but somehow fascinating,"I was very torn when figuring out what to articulate about this book. On one hand, nothing happened, with the highlight being the submarine trip to Seattle. On the other hand, the nothing was somehow interesting. I won't say I walked away invested in the characters, but they were enjoyable enough to watch move about their lives. I agree with other reviews that say the world was very oversimplified -- crime would be rampant and hardly anyone would have any motivation for going to work -- but at the same time, their actions planning for a future they didn't plan to live spoke volumes about the necessity for hope within humans.Overall, worth the read for post-apocalyptic or old science fiction fans who aren't expecting a great deal of action."
4,The halcyon days had a dark side,"This is a strange and morbid tale - but it hits home for those of us who grew up in an era when we really did fear and expect a nuclear holocaust (hopefully that fear and those days never come again?). Here we don't have the cataclysmic descent into the horrors of The Road - instead, as the story progresses and each dim hope of survival sadly evaporates, there is a resigned acceptance as to the end of all human life at a known (and rapidly approaching) date. We follow the characters through their different ways of coping with this fate and supporting each other to the end - while some strange but plausible behaviours and events unfold. Depressing? Certainly. Nevertheless it does reflect the world when it stood on the brink of destruction in the late 50s and early 60s. It wasn't all rock and roll - there was a very dark side to life at that time too. Let's not go back there ..."
5,Heart-rending and Thought provoking,"I am re-reading this book and had to put it down. Everytime I read this book I end up in tears from the pain. It isn't a book that you can't put down because you have to put it down. It is far to powerful to take in all at once. You are left instantly without hope, yet despite that he causes you to hope beyond hope. As well as being an excellent read it carries a powerful and important message that this world may too easily become our own."
1,This Book Was Really Awful.,"This book had the most BS I have ever read. Cobalt bombs only exist on paper. Frankly, I think it is wholly unrealistic and dangerous for it turns people away from civil defense measures which could save their lives. Mr. Shute was a great writer of fiction, but this book, as far as realism is concerned, completely missed the bullseye."
5,I could not get it out of my mind.,"This is an astonishing book; somehow it rings just as true today as it must have when it first came out in the late fifties.I have read it a number of times, and each time I find myself praying that it will turn out differently for the people in the story.This is a MUST READ!"
5,How can fiction hurt so much?,"I fancied myself well-read. I also thought I had felt it all and conquered it all. But when my English teacher made me read this book, my universe was ripped into two pieces and forced down my throat in a way that hurt. I had to stop and look at what I held dear, how fragile it all really is, and my own mortality that I thought I'd accepted. It's impossible for me not to admire the characters in this book: facing their deaths, agonizingly slow in coming, with as much dignity as each individual could muster. Dashed hopes, dreams cut short, beauty that was never to be...innocent victims, and nothing left in the end but the waves sighing along the rocky shores of a nation that was nothing but a Dreamland to me before. Thank God something opened my eyes before I let them be closed by my own ridiculous faith in my own ability to fight and win invariably."
3,I guess it depends on your view of a post-nuclear world,"The premise of this book is a fascinating one: How people are living after a world war that took place between the US and China.The stories of each character were explored very well. The gripping part was when the subs search around the Northern Hemispheres for survivors. When they found none, everyone accepted the inevitability that the world would end.It was interesting to read Shute's idea of how the general population would act when they all knew that they were going to die. I think the movie better portrayed the anarchy that was going on around the major cities of Australia."
2,Disappointing,"I think this book just doesn't stand the test of time. It is such a praised classic that I had to buy/read it. Wish I saved my money and got it from the library. If you like ""literature"" this may be for you, if you like to be entertained skip this and read another classic ""Earth Abides"""
3,Interesting but bleak,"What if the powerful countries of the world waged a nuclear war so catastrophic that all life was destroyed, and you were stuck in southern Australia, watching the deadly radiation move slowly, inexorably your way? That is the question posed by this classic post-apocalyptic novel. The inevitable conclusion is rather dreary. However, the characters seem a bit too 1950s, and therefore not quite realistic. Still, it's an interesting, if bleak, what-if scenario."
5,One of 3-4 books that built my view of humanity,"I'm re-reading this book because I can still remember the way it stoned me as a junior high kid as the Cold War still lingered. This book, along with Kerouac's On The Road and a couple of Hemingway's masterpieces helped me cross the bridge from impressionable youth to building a life based on character, making my own experiences, and respecting and appreciating the ability to do so for as long as I can. On the Beach is still so very relevant. I won't ever forget the impression it left on me."
5,Rather enjoyed it,"At first I was surprised to find what seemed to be very little action. About 50 pages in I was wondering when the tension would rise and things would really start. But that never happened. It's poetic in that way. Very ""Hollow Men"" - Not with a bang but a whimper. The whole book felt like the dying whimper of humanity, and that made it unique and special and perfectly executed in my opinion. I think Shute accomplished exactly what he intended by keeping things low-key and not melodramatic. It was still a book I got engrossed in, perhaps because it didn't fit any kind of typical survival/action/end of the world scenario. No roving gangs, no shoot 'em up, no real preparedness. Not to say I don't like those types of books. This one was just different, not made to be depressing or moralistic or inspiring or anything, I don't think. Just, here's the end, wrought by humans, nothing anyone can do. And then considering how people might handle that. Great book."
5,Worth it,"It starts of a bit slow, but it is a great book. Just stick with it. It's one of the best books I've read in a while"
5,Cautionary tale of nuclear meltdown apprehension,"I have seen the movie based on this book On the Beach starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Tony Perkins, and the movie was quite faithful to this book, though the book of course had more story to it, and was a very entertaining read. Though a sad story of how a last unaffected city is dealing with the fears of approaching nuclear meltdown, this book is very true to life in how people might react to this situation, the anxieties, and the helplessness of realizing there is nothing to be done to stop the approaching genocide. This book should be required reading in all schools around the world, so young readers can face the realities of living in the atomic age, and try to acquire more fans of nuclear disarmament."
5,On the Beach,I ordered this book for my granddaughter because it's premise has great application to today. I read it in the 60's.
3,"Slow and rather predictable, but worth a quick read...","If you want to read a decent anti-war novel and you don't have much else to do on a gray and rainy day, pick this one up. It's somewhat dated, but at the same it speaks some truth about human behavior when faced with the end of the world.The characters' behavior isvery predictable. And they are somewhat one-dimensional cut-outs from the 50's-60's era. However, the reader is still captivated by the submarine crew's search for life in North America."
4,Good Book!!!! A deffinate good read!!!,This was a wonderful book. It showed the world how to treat their surroundings before it was too late.
2,boring,This book is not for seniors in high school. Educators need to find more interesting things to read about.
1,I very badly written book,"This is a horrible book. The characters are so preditable and the plot is so boring and uneventful. Nevil Shute has written a lot of good books, but this is definatly not one of them. If this page had a 0 star option, I would've given it that rating."
1,A Major Let Down,"Well, we had to read this book in English class. It is supposedly a classic, but many of the members of my class agree with me that it does not deserve its award winning title. First of all the characters in the book have very odd relationships, not resembling those of real people. Secondly, human nature is to protect oneself and its offspring. All the characters in the novel are taking their death as it comes, but if they were smart they could build underground shelters, stay there for 5-10 years and then return to the surface when the radiation has lessened. All in all it was a bit of a dissapointment, however the movie is very well done and I would recommend that first and foremost before the book."
3,"Good, Not Great, Post-Nuclear Literature","Shute's ""On The Beach,"" while an interesting character study on the aftereffects of nuclear war on a fairly remote population of people, makes for interesting reading, but is not especially outstanding in the realm of post-nuclear literature. The inevitability of the characer's demise leads them to dealing with their situation in many different ways, each of which is realistic and thought-provoking (what would YOU do?) but this book stands more as a study of human psychology in extreme conditions rather than one of the truly great ""nuke/mass disaster"" novels.Shute's writing, however, is fantastic and his characters fully believable. The fact that the book is rather short on much except conversation and character development sections more or less shows where its interests lie. This book is definately more for the intellectual interested in the effects of impending doom on people rather than the thrill-seeker looking for a graphic description of nuclear war."
5,I encourage you to read this novel!,I read this book 5 years ago and I still remember the story like yesterday! It's books like this one that should be required reading in school. It was truely a wonderful story that will keep you interested until the end.
4,ON THE BEACH BOOK,GREAT BOOK. I SAW THE MOVE MANY YEARS AGO AND THEN AGAIN THIS MONTH WHICH MADE ME ORDER THE BOOK.
3,"Okay, a quick read","I am an avid fan of end of the world ANYTHING (ranging from the religious to the ridiculous), and this is one EVERYONE's top apocalyptic lists, but I just didn't feel riveted like many others. THis book was small, but it still felt slow in its story. And depressing? You better believe it! But the point of the story is its realism; nuclear holocaust is supposed to depress the hell out of you! I could've passed on the trashy alchoholic character, but for its time frame (Australia in the post apocalyptic 1950's) and its size (less than 200 pages in my paperback), it is worth an afternoon to read."
3,Nuclear Destruction....that sucks,"I thought that On the Beach was a semi-decent book. One major downfall was that it was dull and boring through a good bit of the main story. Instead of 320 pages, I believe it could have been done in about 200, to make the pace of it better. It ties in nicely with our studies in that it deals with life after a world wide nuclear war. I thought it comical that it depicted the Russians as the one of the ""bad guys"", and it didn't even mention America as being part of the war. The ending was a let down, as everyone just kind of died off with no real plot to it, except for maybe the Moira-Dwight ordeal. Basically, it was boring from beginning to end with the occasional interesting plot twist here and there. I do not agree with the quote that ""Every American should read On the Beach..."", as it was not that good. I give it a thumbs in the middle, no more."
1,great topic - narrow treatment,"How would you react to the inevitable destruction of all life by a slowly encroaching radioactive cloud? I can imagine a multitude of responses.The author seems content to explore a few simple variations of the same damned theme: remain calm and pleasant and display a simple-minded way of not accepting reality. It's not even a very interesting theme. Even in the our current age of peace and prosperity, there isn't that kind of homogeneity.If group reaction to extinction intriguing topic to you, I'd recommend you read Camus' ""The Plague"". If nuclear war is your particular interest, then try ""The Last Ship""."
1,Missing Pages,"I was very disappointed to learn that 31 pages of the book I purchased were completely missing. It is very difficult to get into reading a book when that many pages at the beginning of the book are ""not there"" After a trip to the library to read the missing pages it is turning out to be an ""OK"" book. It is required reading for a high school class :("
2,On The Beach,"I was very impressed with the shipping time for the book. However, there was an obvious scar down the entire length of the front cover. It looked as though someone had taken a razor down the front cover and just cut through the first layer of the cover. While I was very satisfied with the book itself (it's one of my favorites), I must acknowledge the severe damage done to the book - it really is sub-par."
1,Check well before buying!!!,Bought it for a Ford Explorer Sport Trac 2002. The check compatibility chart said it was compatible but apparently its not. Its only compatible with these modelsFordMustang 2001-2004Expedition 2003-2006Explorer 2002-2005LincolnNavigator 2003-2006Aviator 2003-2005MercuryMountaineer 2002-2005Not compatible at all for the Sport Trac. Dont doubt that the kit works for the models listed above but its sure a waste of time and money if it doesnt.
1,New Base Model Poorer than Previous One,"Based on a Consumer's Report review, last year I purchased an inexpensive Proctor-Silex 4 slice toaster, which was as reviewed--wonderful. I needed another such toaster and purchased the one for which these comments are directed--it appears to have replaced the earlier base model. But this one is hardly as good as its predecessor.The sliding crumb trays have vanished as has the light that one can push to raise the toast before it automatically pops up. And it is not that easy to push the lever down again if the toast needs additional browning. It appears that the toaster needs to cool down a bit before the lever will stay down. And...it takes longer to brown the bread.It is terrible."
1,PURE UTTER JUNK!,"Worthless:Doesn't even toast entire piece of bread as it's to short and top 1.5"" of bread stick out.Won't even take rye style piece.No cancel buttonCHEAP CHINA junk!"
3,OK - toaster,"This toaster does toast, but it's a little slow at doing so. It also lacks the ability to 'stop' toasting if the user sees that the food is ready. For frozen waffles as an example, with the setting turned all the way up, it still does not cook fully, without another 1/2 cycle toasting. It does serve the purpose, but I'd consider another toaster if I were purchasing again. Until then, I'll have to toast things twice."
1,bad,"i bought this toaster not on amazon, it lasted two months, one side only works. never buying ps agagin horrriibbble"
4,Its a good toaster at any price,"Good at toast, good at pop tarts and good at bagels. This thing is a breakfast machine. Toasts as good as any toaster I have used before and the price is not bad."
1,Damage package how can they even sell something like that.,I am very upsetting I just received this product and the box was damage there is no way I can give this a Christmas gift. Now I have to return it and I don't know if I'm going to receive another in time. I will never order again at this point. I mean I can't even contact anyone by phone. I'm not sure how the product is but if it comes this way I don't even want to know. There should be a customer service number to call.
2,4 slot toaster,Product was difficult to operate. Had to hold down lever for an extended time in order for it to stay down and toast.
4,4 slice toaster,"We saw this on ""America's Test Kitchen"" and since we needed a new toaster, and it was the best rated on that show, we ordered it. We are very satisfied with the accuracy of it's controls, but didn't realize that you cannot eject the toast early if you decide to. That is our only complaint. Otherwise, it's a very good toaster and lives up to all it's ads! Very good price as well."
3,Its a basic toaster,"Have had the toaster a few months. Has worked so far on all bread types although takes longer than our previous one and top of unit heats up pretty good. Cancel feature that other reviews mention is okay. For the price, toaster works fine. but probably wouldn't buy it again. Would opt for a slighty more expensive brand/model."
3,better out there,"This cd showcases a few of the Wailers' 1968 Studio One output, with Lee Perry as engineer and producer.For anyone who is expecting vintage ""Scratch""- the studio wizard-you will not find it on these recordings. In fact, Perry was ironically a very laissez-faire engineer in the beginning, which was a blessing for the rude boy era Wailers. They could record their very raw recordings in a relaxed atmosphere, and the results, while somewhat unprofessional versus what Marley and Tosh achieved later in their careers, has a quaint charm in it of studio novices learning their trade.One last word of warning- for fans of the original Wailers, these recordings were done during Bunny's jailtime for herb possession, so Rita Marley is the 3rd voice.Nice recordings, but they can be had in better condition on other Perry or Marley collections."
5,fantastic,this book is filled with the wide variety of work that yoko ono has amassed over a lifetime - really great book for a yoko fan!
1,The Sad Facts,"I disdain Miss Ono's body of work. Had it not been for John Lennon, she would probably be another burnt-out artist whose mind didn't quite survive the 60's. Let us ask ourselves by what merit ths woman qualifies as an artist either visually or vocally.Her art is at best simplistic, at worst attempting a movement that had passed by the time she was a few years old. When Duchamp did it, it was innovative. When Miss Ono did it years later, it a lame, drug-laced imitation of early 20th-century masters.If we must endure widows of rock stars and their art, I sincerely hope the world ends before Courtney Love discovers the Dadaists."
1,EXTREMELY dangerous for guinea pigs,"Guinea pigs should never use wheels or those plastic run around balls, they are EXTREMELY bad for their spines and can cause extreme plysical dammage. Guinea pigs have very sensitive spines and any activity that cause their spine to bend should be avoided.Do NOT buy this product, (or any prouct that causes your pig to bend their body in any way) it will harm your guinea pig.I know this from long time guinea pig owner-ship and from working at an animal hospital."
1,Trash,"Do not buy this. I had to return this. Nine inch diameter is okay for Syrian Hamsters and even works for Dwarf hamsters, however this wheel doesn't work. There was a more sturdy model once manufactured by Hagen which is actually the one pictured and should have a fixed and welded axel. The one I received is a cheaper model, it does not have an axel, it is not safe and cannot function thus it cannot be used. And of course as stated in the previous review, Guinea pigs don't use wheels.Do not waste your money on any exercise wheel for hamsters or any other small pet and just buy a"
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"This book was excellent. I could not stop turning the pages and I did not want to put it down. If you have not read this book, run out and get it. It is a MUST read. That Kennedy was a trip!!!!!!!!! Ms. Flager never disappoints."
4,tough but rewarding,"Tough... M&D is not an easy read, certainly for someone who's not a native speaker of English, with its mock-18th century language, Pynchon's elaborate vocabulary, the absense of a clear story line and writing to the reader. ... but rewarding But in return you get some brilliant scenes, dialogs, stories, faits-divers, that make you want even more. This being my first Pynchon, I'm going to read more of him, and can recommend this to anyone who's willing to make an effort - it's the return on investment that counts!"
5,Excellent Book,"Great book for fans of Pynchon, much more accessible than Gravity's Rainbow. Very long which I consider a plus as Mr. Pynchon doesn't come out with new books too often."
1,remedy for insomnia,"OH MY GOD HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE SO BORING?I found a nice hard back version in a bargain bin somewhere for $6. Picked it up, took it home. Every time I put it down, I had to check my pulse. Now I know why it was only $6."
1,I Fart in Your General Direction.,"British Humor - I think not, but like Thomas Pynchon, I am a Yank after all. I guess my only question would be which of the following DO YOU think is a great American Novilist:""Snow-balls have flown their Arcs, starr'd the Sides of Outbuildings, as of Cousins, carried Hats away into the brisk Wind off Delaware, - the Sleds are brought in and their Runners carefully dried and greased, shoes deposited in the back Hall, a stocking'd-foot Descent made upon the great Kitchen, in a purposeful Dither since Morning, punctuated by the ringing Lids of various Boilers and Stewing-Pots, fragrant with Pie-Spices, peel'd Fruits, Suet, heated Sugar, - the Children, having all upon the Fly, among rhythmic slaps of Batter and Spoon, coax'd and stolen what they might, proceed, as upon each afternoon all this snowy Advent, to a comfortable Room at the rear of the House, years since given over to their carefree Assaults."" -Thomas Pynchon""Call me Ishmael."" - Herman Melville"
2,Good but not History,"For the person who likes reading book, especially history, this book will please you in that it is a funny, and well thought through book.On the other hand, to the history student, this is not the book that I would use for any history paper or project. Althought this book is about the very people invloved in the making of the most famous border dispute in the United States, it is not very historical. This book has conversations with such pioneers as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin but there is no evidence that these conversation really happened, in fact I question that they really could have. The thing to remember about this book is that it is all imagined by the author and to use it in a research paper would be the writer's negligence because this book is not a replacement for fact.A good fiction book, a bad history book."
5,The greatest American novel since WWII,"In Mason and Dixon Thomas Pynchon has created an incredible landmark in American fiction. For anyone interested in historical fiction, American studies, or plain old great literature this is a MUST read. As in his other novels Pynchon again brings into focus how the ideal of America contrasts with its reality and displays it in all of its beauty and horror, its greatest potential and most terrible failure. From its narrative style, to its cast of characters, to its profound examination of science and religion, this is a tour de force that is as near perfect as a book can be. Both extraordinarily funny and complex, I dare any serious reader to hate this book."
2,Didn't get it...,"I purchased this book 4 months ago and have tried to read it three times now. I have always enjoeyed reading, but reading this is horrible! Reading should not be chore! Maybe I am doomed to be a simple, pulp fiction reader for the rest of my life. Maybe I am not *smart* enough or 'hip' enough to tackle a great piece of literature, but WHO CARES!"
2,"Convoluted, complex ,hard to follow, frustrating.","You need to pass an exam to read this book. Do you intimately know the personality of Nevil Maskelyne? The fights within the British Astronomical Society over methods of computing longitude? The political affiliations of the various members? Who in the astronomy community had ""pull"" from what powerful politicians? What the religious speculations of these astronomers might have been? If not, you will find much of this book incomprehensible, as a great deal of it consists of Pynchon's pages long 'dialogues' purporting to show the mental activities of his characters about these issues. It's like trying to follow barroom conversations from another planet.Once in a while you get the hang if it--more often, you just feel like hanging up the book. If you don't have a high frustration tolerance, pass on this one."
1,"Terrible...No plot, no story line....","I rated this book ""1 Star"" only because there is no rating lower...If Thomas Pynchon has a plot or a story line, he surely has hidden it very well.. I slogged through more than 25 hours of reading trying to discover the plot ot story line, hoping that each subsequent chapter would get better..But no, just an endless series of unconnected and unrelated ramblings... Hundreds of unrelated and disconnected characters too.. Some as ridiculous as a talking dog, and a robot duck... One could read this book from front to back, back to front, or from the middle both ways and not be able to tell the difference.. Thomas Pynchon surely must have been smoking something more powerful than plain tobacco when he wrote this debacle... And the readers who rated it higher than ""1 Star"" must have been smoking something too.. A complete waste of time... Never again will I read anything by Thomas Pynchon...."
1,the emperor is naked,"This book is a waste of time and paper. It was evidently written for a limited audience--people who can actually read eighteenth century style prose and who still find jokes about ""not inhaling"" to be amusing. I was annoyed to find a book that promised so much in prepub hype; then delivered so little in final presentation."
1,Not worth the effort.,"Mr.Pynchon may be considered one of today's great writers by the cosmopolitan literati, but this provencial reader found his work to be a 773 page morass of archaic vernacular with no particular point. I couldn't wait to finish it just to end my misery. The only book I've ever read that was a complete waste of time !"
1,A Waste of Time,"I read it slow, I reread pages in an effort to understand what was going on. To this day I do not know what the book was about and what was going on. It is a very rare book I will not read until the bitter end but I just had to let it go because it was confusing jumbled and seemed to have no real plot. I have read the other reviews for this book and am amazed by what people saw in it. I thought it was just frustrating and would recommend time better spent doing something else."
1,Huh?,"I consider my myself a reader who relishes literary challenges. Regretfully, I'll need to wait for the english language translation before properly assessing this novel's merit."
3,"Interesting, inventive and, at times, unintelligible","This is the first Pynchon book I've read. The premise was very creative and parts of the story involving the relationship between Mason and Dixon were well done, even touching. However it took about 100 pages to get used to the 18th century writing style. I'm sure I missed 2/3 of the clever anachronisms and many parts of the story were absolutely unintelligible"
2,Let me be the dissenting voice,"I've never read Pynchon before, and after wading through this monstrosity, I don't plan on reading him again any time soon. I absolutely despise this attempt at an 18th century novel. The language, spellings, and vocabulary are fairly true to time, but as any author who attempts to write a book in the style of another era is often just off the mark, so is Pynchon. It reads as pretentious rather than authentic. What could be a great tale is completely convoluted with talking dogs and other anachronistic happenings. I know Pynchon fans everywhere will want to lynch me, but if you are not a Pynchon fan, don't bother reading this. It's too long. Even if you are a fan of 18th c novels, as I am, you will probably find it difficult to get into."
1,Ramblings desperate for an editor,"I slogged through this book as a result of sheer stubborness. The book is a mess and sorely needed a large pair of scissors to trim out the inane chatter. When it is funny, it is hilarious but that accounts for only a tiny percentage of this cinder block of a book. If you like thick historical fiction, read ""the Sot Weed Factor"" by John Barth. Now that is a great book. This is not."
1,"O! What a Horrid Waste of Pulp, A Disaster!","My Tedium never Ceases, yet have I only Dredged thru half of this Tome. My eyes grow Tir'd and my Thoughts grow more hateful towards this Author. History is barely Reveal'd and the style has Vex'd me thru and thru. Hemp smoking Franklin? Confus'd and Stupid Astronomers? Half the book not spent in the country of interest? Yet I plod on, making a use of this Fantastique tale, to knaw away at the Minutes spent in the loo. Wouldst it be quite the thing, if only the Paper t'was softer, I can then make of it a Cleansing Agent for my Posterior once Finished with each page."
4,It's actually fairly good,"I disliked this book a lot at first; in fact, I almost wrote an ugly review here. But then I sat and thought about it for a while, and did some critical reading and decided to undertake the whole thing again. It's a lot easier the second time around (although that's not saying very much, I guess). More importantly, with a clearer understanding of what (I think) he was trying to do, the book was both more understandable and more enjoyable. Still, I wonder at times if he isn't just being difficult for the sake of being difficult.But then, why SHOULD things always be easy?Anyway, the essay on ""Mason & Dixon"" in the New York Review of Books really helped me to clarify my thoughts about the novel. I would recommend reading it, perhaps even before you go at the book itself."
3,Tough but rewarding &#65533; hardcore readers only.,"This is one book I'll never re-read. Which is not to say I'm not glad I read it. Probably not the best choice as one's first Pynchon (but what is?), at times more a test of the reader's stubbornness rather than a reward for his or her patience. Funny, educational, confusion, elusive, silly, erudite. Parts merit five stars, others one, hence my three. I agree with virtually everything every other reviewer has written, pro and con. Go for it if you dare!"
2,I feel so strange,"I figured that one either loves or hates Mr. Pynchon's works. So I feel quite out of place saying that I think Gravity's Rainbow is one of the most important books of the century and that Mason and Dixon is an excruitingly boring, sloppy, overblown, piece of unedited nonsense. Pynchon is a literary icon to me, but nobody should pretend that this book is as important or even as entertaining as his other works. Even when you can't easily find the Emperor, it's still possible he wears no clothes."
2,Mason Dixon: the survey that never ends,"Having loved the flow and imagination of Gravity's Rainbow and the simplicity of The Crying of Lot 49, this was a disappointment.Granted, I know the point is not about surveying per se, but after the first 200 pages I was losing my attention span. Pynchon devotees may love this but except for being able to say I've read most everything of his in print, I'm hard pressed to say more than: he can still craft long, grammatically-correct sentences and shows a real depth in writing.If you can make it to the New World, it gets easier but better reads are out there."
5,OED required,"Okay, I read this twice, but I also subscribed to the Oxford English Dictionary online. To me, this was an economic decision. The printed version is available either as an encyclopedia costing thousdands of dollars, or a merely absurd condensed version that comes with a necessary magnifying glass. The online OED gives you, basically, a search engine that lets you in on what word meant at a given time. Without the $29/mo subscription, I never would have made it through M&D;, which is written, especially in diaogue, in period language.Ben Franklin in tinted specs playing his glass harmonica in a coffee house? Smoking pot with Colonel Washington? A revisiting of V's African slavery angle, these are all great tings, but I can't imagine trying to grasp it without some version of the OED."
2,Difficult For the Sake Of Difficulty,"Okay, theres a point when an effort to create impressive prose and style actually becomes an obsticle to the story. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with having a richness of text, but fiction is about storytelling, and Pynchon gives of an air of ""Look mom, I'm a writer!"". He needs to spend more time telling a story and less time into trying to be James Joyce. If I want Joyce, I'll read Joyce."
2,"The Complete Guide to Buying, maintaing and servicing a horse trailer",the book itself is very informative and useful for a new trailer owner.the disappointment that I feel is having the supplier say that the book is new and receive a new book but that has been scored from top to bottom on the front cover. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! i tried to contact the supplier but they apparently don't have a useful email address.
1,Cotton is VERY BAD for small mammals,"I purchased this exact item from a local store. The package mentions hamsters specifically, so I thought it would be great for mine. Apparently, most vets will strongly recommend AGAINST cotton bedding. Of course I found this out AFTER I had bought and used it. Here's the biggest problems:1) It can tangle their legs and nails, causing dislocated joints, or if tight enough, amputation.2) Swallowed, it can cause impacted intestines.3) It can tangle in teeth and choke hamsters.I bought a package and put a single piece in the cage that my three hamsters lived in. By the time I came home from work, two of them had died, and you could see the cotton still around their teeth.I VERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST ANY COTTON MATERIALS FOR HAMSTERS!Your hamsters will be more than happy with toilet tissue (which is dissolvable if swallowed.)"
1,Misleading picture,"Okay, the product itself is good. HOWEVER, the picture is completely misleading. The picture shows a plastic bag with the white pads that are almost as big as the bag... What I got was a big plastic bag with the pads maybe... a third of the size.... You can't even see the pads because they were on the bottom of the plastic bag. It is absolutely not worth the money and a complete waste of the plastic bag! So not eco-friendly. Why would they need to put such a small tiny product in a huge plastic bag?? If you want to get the exact same product, I recommend you get All Living Things Fluff N' Snuggle Cotton Nesting Material from Petsmart. It is MUCH cheaper and you actually get more product!! (I got this because I needed a few more dollars to get free shipping). Don't waste your money on this. I am very disappointed."
5,A must have....,"If you want worship, this DVD starts with Richard Smallwood's ""Total Praise"" which will make you lift your eyes to the hills. If you want praise, there's Hezekiah Walker's ""I've Got A Reason"" and you will want to sing and shout. If you want some ol' school, there's ""Glad I've Got Jesus"" by the Canton Spirituals and you'll start tappin your foot and shakin' your head......this DVD something for whatever you want to experience...."

4,Great for review,"I found Dr. Colwell's little book an excellent source for reviewing the basics of New Testament Greek Grammar. Colwell is a polished scholar of high attainments, and his grasp of the Koine idiom is superior. Using this book will aid anyone whose Greek may be somewhat rusty, and perhaps also be a guide for a rank beginner."
2,it was published in 1993!,"This might've been a very helpful book 12 years ago, but a lot has happened since. Heaps of researches have made their debuts since then that seriously outdates this book... by 12 years.For example, the author's list of ADD symptoms only covers the hyperactivity element and neglects the symptoms of a child with inattentive type ADD (without hyperactivity). An inattentive type wouldn't necessarily have a hard time sitting down. Contrary to many of the items on the list, a child with inattentive type ADD would more likely be day-dreaming (similar to being hyperactive in one's own mind.. as I'd like to think of it).Try to stay away from this one.. (unless if you're writing a paper or something and need to comepare differences/similarities between what we USED think and what we know/think NOW.)"
5,This book put things in perspective for me.,I was so confused when my child was first diagnosed with Learning Disorders. This book helped me to break things down and understand the components of my child's disorders. It is an excellent guide to understanding Learning Disorders and how to reach out for additional assistance - suggestions and ideas.
2,CD won't play in player (CD-R?),This CD and another by the same artist will not play in my CD player which doesn't read CD-R's. When I play it in a boom box it will work. The songs just don't appeal to my children or our youth group. The song lyrics are well written but the tunes themselves are not catchy to the kids. They seem to like Colin Buchannan's Aussie Praise collection much better. Amazon doesn't sell it but cbd.com does. Great Effort though by this couple.
5,Amandaaaa-- {AwEsOmE Cd/DvD},"""Berth"" Is a must have for any fan of The Used! The live CD is filled with the awesome tracks from ""In Love And Death"" and even a couple of tracks off of their self titled album! The DVD comes packed with an inside look at the band, AMAZING concert footage, and the funniest Q&A I have seen in a while! Over all its just a great CD/DVD collection to own...I seriously recommend it!!!!"
4,I never saw Maybe Memories,"so I don't know how this DVD compares to that ...the DVD: tour fun, get to meet the band, and some fun backstage stuff. It's nice to see Bert and Quinn drinking beers, because I thought they were sober people, haha. There is also a complete live show on the DVD which is well done, the sound is mixed well for a live concert DVD and the used are SUPER HIGH energy, always fun to watch.the CD: only 9 songs, I would have liked a few more. The live version of I'm a Fake its NUTS and Maybe Memories Quinn starts laying the riff to the Refused's New Noise and they rip into that for a verse which is also a great highlight.overall i liked the entire package, I like to watch/listen to these guys to get amped up for the evening and this does just that."
5,AWSOME,"It's a great gift for the fans. The documentary is very good, and the live performance is awesome. The songs for their second album sound so much better than the album. Great!"
3,Entertaining if you're a fan of The Used,"If you're a fan of The Used, Berth is probably a worthwhile addition to your collection. I watched the concert footage expecting more onstage antics from Bert McCracken and was somewhat disappointed, but I watched it without having seen The Used perform live. About two weeks after I bought the DVD I did go see the band live in Detroit and he was a lot more animated onstage than the DVD let on. Clearly, the video was toned down to fit all audiences.In fact, the DVD I bought was did not have Parental Warning and all of the expletives were bleeped out. During the live performance I saw, about every other word was ****, lol.Still, the live music CD is definitely worth the investment as it adds another dimension to the studio recordings.The other content on the DVD was so-so."
2,Are you kidding,This is what bothers me. These records companies and bands are retarded. The cd doesn't have the full concert. They could have added those two songs that were on the dvd. Give me a break.
5,worth buying,"This game is worth buying, it is fun to play for any age, great sound, and graphics, I just love it. best racing game on the game market."
5,My rating,I think this game is an amazing game with the most stunning graphics and its amazing cars and has fun things to do in it. thank you for reading my reavew.
2,An Otherwise 5-Star Game,"I personally feel that the game deserves 5 stars and that it is a great successor to Need For Speed 3 and 4.HOWEVER, there is one design flaw that won't allow gamers to enjoy the game to its full extent. Most of the cars and tracks are locked and the only way to access them is to go through a very challenging Evolution mode. So, if you think you'll buy this game and take a 911 Turbo for a spin, you are in for a sad surprise."
4,Far beyond Midtown Madness 2,"Yes, with breath-taking graphics (not to mention replay), beautiful tracks and superior car physics, NFS 5 IS the best car game on the market. Still, a star had to be deducted, because the game is unwilling to recognize some plug and play joysticks on Win98, fails to show certain types of damage (such as a shattered windshield) and makes winning access to new car models so hard, by the time you get to drive today's Porsche cars, they will have become yesterday's."
1,"Not supported on NT, 2000 and XP","Not supported on NT, 2000 and XP - useless for me. Great game, tried it on W2K pro, but it randomly resets itself, corrupts player data... not fun to lose several hours."
3,"Good, but not much substantial improvement","I think EA should stop trying to release a new version every year and really work on the NFS series to improve it. There really isn't a huge difference between NFS2 and this fifth installment. Yes, the graphics are a bit better as well as gameplay, but nothing compared to a lot of other sequals out there. If you have never played any other NFS games, then you still will love this, but for those of you who already own one of the older ones, you really aren't missing a whole lot."
2,Need more fun,"To start out skip this game. Yes it looks great and the graphics are some of the best, but this game lacks the fun that the last version had. There are only four tracks to race. Yes there are lots of porsches to choose from, but the lack of tracks, different races and the missing pursuits is this games downfall. Who wants to drive one of the best cars in the world on these lame tracks and never get to fell the real speed of the game. If you want a better driving game go with driver or super bike 2001 or 2000. These are some of the best looking and best driving games, because of the number of tracks, graphics and just plain fun to drive. Once again skip Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed."
2,Not up to snuff!,"I'll probably be one of the few people who trash this title but I've got to speak my mind. I'll warn anyone who has a geforce card to stay clear for a while. The read me file makes reference to the fact that there is some instability with older drivers of this video card. Well I have the latest drivers and I still cannot complete ONE race without a complete system lockup! The graphics are outstanding but I have another big gripe here. The ""Newer more realistic physics"" of the came cause the car to bounce up and down constantly and if you are prone to motion sickness get ready for a major headache. I have not found a way to turn this off, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I am a HUGE fan of the NFS series but this is one major dissappointment so far. I hope you have better luck."
5,I'll never go back to High Stakes...,This game uses a whole new engine with a superb driving model and breathtaking graphics. After my first race my knees were shaking from the adrenalin rush. I highly recommend this! Best driving game yet.
5,I NEED MORE!,"This is the best driving game/simulation that I have played. The physics and graphics are outstanding! I play with a PC steering wheel and it is very realistic. Electronic Arts needs to make more games like this. Take the same concept and use it with other exotic brand names. Lamborghini and Ferrari would be perfect for this type of game, both cars have an extensive history and long list of models to drive...I want more NEED FOR SPEED!!!"
5,WOW!!,dude..this game rocks! I've played lots of racing games and this one is by far the best. The evolution mode starts you out in 1950 with just enough money for your first car and you slowly move up through the years until 2001. The test driver mode was way cool and challenging. The grapics are awesome though sometimes there was a glitch or two that the game quickly corrected. This game was so cool! You can buy and install hi-po parts for your porsche or keep it stock. Even if you don't like porsches BUY THIS GAME!
2,Locks up,"The game itself seems to be pretty good, but my pc locks up way too often right in the middle of a race........very frustrating!! And I have a brand new 950MHz NVida HP, so I know it's not my pc's problem. But even if it didn't lock up, I don't think it's as good as NFS III. The tracks aren't as challenging, and the other race cars don't challenge you as well. The Porshe cars are cool, and the graphics good, but the fact that it locks up my pc and I have to reboot every ten minutes is rediculous. I just bought the game 10 days ago and I've already given up on it. Don't waste your money."
3,"fun product, but use a heating pad","This is a unique item, but the stones go from being too hot to cold in about 1 minute. Save your money, get a heating pad instead"
2,Cold rock bath.,"I thought I would get this as a birthday present for my friend. The stones take 40 minutes to heat. Once they are on your body, they become cold in about a minute. This is nothing like hot-stone therapy in real salon."
1,Not what I expected,"I thought that the heating unit was okay. It took a lot longer than I expected to heat up, but when it did, it seemed to do an okay job. The stones however, were WAY too small and very rough. The quality of the stones was of lesser quality than what my husband, and 3 kids, could have picked up on a family outing. I was so excited when I ordered this item, and SO disappointed when I received it."
5,I have a question,I received this as a gift years ago and put it away. I got it out today and realized I don't have my instruction book anymore. How much water should I put in. One container full or fill it to cover the rocks? I'm going with one container full at this time but if anyone has any idea that could help I'd appreciate it.
4,A home spa experience,"I found this product to be an amazing home treatment. You recieve the tantalizing experience of an all service spa. Yet, the whole product cost half as much as a 1 hour treatment at a professional spa. And you can keep it and use it over and over again. I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn't have hundreds of dollars to spend, yet, still wants to be pampered."
3,Licht und Schatten,"Review in German Language / Review auf Deutsch:Plus: Die FAZ wurde sehr schön für den Kindle umgesetzt, die Lesbarkeit, Formatierungen und Navigation innerhalb der Zeitung ist sehr gut und angenehm (ganz im Gegensatz zu den vielen lieblos konvertierten Büchern ...).Plus: Die Zeitung wird gegen 23:00 h des Vorabends deutscher Zeit bereits auf das Gerät gebeamt - es ist schon toll, wenn man abends schon die Schlagzeilen von morgen lesen kann.Minus: Die Kindle Version der FAZ enthält ausschließlich die ""Nachrichten""-Bereiche der FAZ, also kein Wetter, kein TV, ...Minus: Zumindest für die nach Deutschland gelieferte Version gilt: Keinerlei Bilder/Fotos!Es gibt eine 2-Wochen Trial-Subscription, so dass sich jeder ein Bild machen kann, bevor er endgültig abboniert.Fazit: Schön für alle, die nicht problemlos an eine aktuelle FAZ herankommen. Für in Deutschland Wohnenende kommt eher die konventionelle Zeitung in Betracht."
3,Empfehlung!,Als eine der besten deutsprachigen Zeitungen kann ich die FAZ uneingeschraenkt empfehlen.Abzuege gibt es fuer das fehlen von allen Bildern und Graphiken.Dieser Review wurde auf Amazons Kindle 2 geschrieben.
2,Are they not offering Sunday?,"I teach college level German literature and I like to see from time to time what the conservative slant is in Germany; however, I've NEVER been able to buy the single-time Sunday edition. Every time I buy the FAZ on Sunday, it gives me Saturday's paper. Was soll's?I've stopped buying it at all now."
4,re: sunday offerings...,"""one of those academics"" reviewer mentioned that there seems to be no sunday issue of FAZ. that's right.there is a ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung"" available as hardcopy in a different format, but not for the kindle."
2,Double price for a German newspaper if u purchase it in Germany ?????,"Receiving my Kindle I was really looking forward to get one of the praised newspapers subscriptions.Would be just so convenient.First little surprise was the fact that there are barely European ones available.So, I took the test subscription from the FAZ since I really like the newspaper itself.But onces I was accidentally not logged in to Amazon but just checking the US store I found that US subscription is half the prize.Are you ****** kidding ? Please, why should I pay here in Europe the double price for a European newspaper ?And please dont argue with 3G prices. Either you offer a suitable system with comparable prices for Europe or you just sell here the wifi-model and drop 3G possibility.Deeply disappointed....."
1,"International customers: double the price, half the content","U.S. customers get a decent product here - all the paper for $15/mo.Non U.S. customers get the paper minus all images and graphics, for $30/mo.If my Kindle is wi-fi only, how does that make any sense?There is no cost for delivering graphics over the internet to any country.This pricing/content offering is downright insulting.I will wait for Amazon to come to their senses."
5,International Delivery,"Five stars for the Newspaper, but one star for Amazons international delivery.I understand, why you cut out all Images for international delivery, when it is delivered wireless. But I tried to download it to my computer and then sync it via USB to my Kindle. There are no pictures as well and I see no reason for it.Please Amazon, give international customers a chance for Newspapers and Magazines with Images. At least when you download it and sync via USB!"
