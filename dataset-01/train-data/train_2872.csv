1,"How do you say ""stinker"" in Arabic?","My God, what a horrible mess of a movie. Was there a single character here that one could feel for? Nope. Not only that, the constant jerking around of the camera gives you motion sickness. (That's defintely one modern fimmaking technique I can do without; reminds me of how an amateur would handle a camera rather than imparting some sort of gritty, ""real"" feel). Then there's the half-baked story. A total insult to your intelligence. In summary: No characters worth mentioning, idiotic story and overuse of film ""technique"" to try to make up for it. The movie fails on all counts. Bad, bad, bad!"
4,Intense...,"This was a very good movie that does a very good job of portraying the complexities associated with the current struggles between the United States and terrorism. The movie begins with a terrible killing in Saudi Arabia by a group wishing to purge the country of all non-Muslims. Jamie Foxx plays the head of a small team sent in to find the person responsible for over a hundred deaths. Things don't start well for the team as they meet much red-tape, but after developing good relations with one of the police officers assigned to ""baby-sit"" them, they are able to continue the investigation.What ensues is a very intense, pulse-pounding movie that really will push you to the edge of your seats. The choice of actors is spot-on (Chris Cooper is fantastic) and I'm happy that the ending did a fair job rather than look for a quick, Hollywood ending.I'm glad this movie was made and was thoroughly entertained."
3,kingdom of heaven,"dvd disc keeps stopping, then you must fast farward to get it to start againkindom ofg heaven, good movioe bad dvd"
2,Wouldn't watch it again,"Explosions, car chases and suspense made for interesting enough viewing, but I couldn't really get past the immense cultural ignorance of the FBI agents as portrayed in this movie. Are these guys really our top 2%? Then how come, after getting special super-secret permission to bring in a crack team, they brought a Jew and a woman? They might as well have brought their dog and let it do its business on the palace lawn. How come they were reading The Koran for Dummies on the flight over? They should have already read the Koran itself. The woman didn't have the sense to keep her head and arms covered around the Muslim men, or to insist on a separate bedroom, but of course she wanted to be taken seriously. And there was the hokey ending -- 'We'll kill them all!"" -- a bit too much in-your-face with the never ending cycle of violence."
2,Enjoyable except for....,Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner were totally and completely miscast and spoilt what could have been an excellent movie. Top marks to the actor who played the Saudi police inspector. Locations shot in Abu Dhabi were right on.
4,Hollywood Cop buddy movie...in the Middel East,"The Kingdom is a A-Typical Hollywood cop buddy movie transplanted to the Middle East, with a almost too far flung ending where the heroes manage to pull in all the ropes and solve everything...just a little too easy. The film looks awesome, is well acted, and the last half is full of great bullet flying action.Foxx does a good job in the film, though how the 'main' hero has to do everything, solve everything, get the team to Saudi Arabia sort of bugged me...he has a team, let the others do something too. I felt the only other team member that gets decent scream time is Cooper."
3,Solid Actioner,"'The Kingdom' is a solid action thriller from director Peter Berg. One of Berg's better efforts. Good all-around cast. Jamie Foxx is turning into a reliable leading man. Good supporting cast with Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. The exception is the awful performance turned in by Jeremy Piven as a State Department glad-hander. It's a real shame because the rest of the movie is pretty accurate, including digitally altered scenes that depict the actual Riyadh skyline. The movie doesn't shy away from depicting Arabs as terrorists and actually portrays some of the complexities of Arab terrorism without pandering to the usual Hollywood sensibilities."
4,Very Good Action Movie,"I wish Amazon would give us a 10 star rating system rather than the current 5. IMO I think this movie is a 7 out of 10.The current ranking of 3 stars would be to hard and 4 stars probably to high, 3.5 stars, (or 7 out of 10)is where I think it's at.It is a very good action flick with a great finale and well worth a look, but it's not one of the greats."
2,another terrorist story,"This movie had a plot that was pretty boring if I can be honest. I wasn't really interested in the fast pace or the ""hurry up and force the viewers into the storyline while all kinds of confusing violence and people screaming goes on in the background"" way of writing. The actors and actresses played their parts really good, but it can't save a storyline that isn't interesting. Plus, as another reviews mentions, it's just typical war prapaganda. How many times are we going to see movies like this? I've had enough of them. All the subtitles you have to read are more trouble than they're worth. Enough is enough."
4,Motion burrrrr ruins the flick,"The Kingdom, Unbox download is action pack, but motion blurry. If you want to enjoy,then I would recommend YOU BUY the disc."
2,Don't waste your money,"I saw The Kingdom in the theater and am reviewing it here to try to save folks some money. One of these days a good, thoughtful movie will be made about the so-called war on terror. This ain't it. It's more like an episode of ""CSI Riyadh"". The only actor who registers is Ashraf Barhoum; his American co-stars are uniformly mediocre. Granted, they are working from a hackneyed script which requires them to play stereotypical profane, arrogant Americans in a foreign land. The plot is only tenuously rooted in reality; at one point, the FBI forensics team suddenly morphs into a group of Special Forces-type stone killers. Poor Jennifer Garner looks like she doesn't know what she's doing in this movie. Her one expression is a pouty face."
2,The kingdom of boredom,"Saudi Arabia looks like a cross between Vegas and Iraq in this incredibly illogical, boring film signed Peter Berg. Jamie Foxx does his best to look like Denzel Washington, and even succeeds to a large extent, but not even he can save this production. The only action scenes are in the beginning and at the end (""Abu Hamza, I presume?""), and the ending feels strangely lachrymose. Frankly, this is so bad that it only deserves one star, but since I don't like Wahhabis, I suppose I have to give it two. And now, a weather forecast!"
5,A Real War Movie,"If you don't like America, think there is no terror threat, and believe that terrorists are just misunderstood, this is NOT the movie for you.In Saudi Arabia on an American compound a massive coordinated suicide terror attack occurs. Many are killed, all in the name of religious extremism. A small contingency from the FBI goes to Saudi Arabia on a mission to find the plotters of the attack. And of course along the way, there are some very exciting action scenes. Jennifer Garner really kicks some terrorist back-side. Jamie Foxx is completely believable and superb in his role.When I saw this in the theater, people actually cheered. It isn't like Redacted and other anti-American films out today. This is a pro-US film. Also, it shows the consequences of religious extremism and presents an inspiring idea of how the West and the Middle East can work together towards the common goal of peace."
2,Barely average film...could have been better,"Rich subject matter, poignant, decent actors involved lead to a surprisingly by-the-numbers film. The action wasn't as intense as I thought it would be and a lot of the plot seemed overly contrived and forced. Characters aren't as fleshed out and 3D as they could be, esp Fox and his Saudi co-hort. You can tell who's going to buy the farm a mile away. For the most part, a cliched and underachieveing film. Too bad."
3,Messy.,Starts with an expertly produced bloodbath...then a rather slow hour of investigation...ends with another bloodbath.I saw this in the same week as Eastern Promises and Sweeney Todd. I'm drained!
2,Kingdom of Hollywood,"The last half hour is definitely tense and action-filled. But the preceding 90 minutes are convoluted and totally unbelievable. As a straight action film this would've worked, but as a treatise on US-Middle East relations, it fails miserably. BLACKHAWK DOWN is a much better military action film. A MIGHTY HEART is a much richer examination of US/Islamic relations in the current climate. The Kingdom tries to be both and fails. Go see the other two before wasting your time on this one."
2,Rubbish,The frenetic pace of this movie was a little too fast for me. I didn't really get the chance to get into the characters and their development. The action is definitely adrenaline-pumping and leave your nerves raw which action-movie goers will love. The movie needed to turn down 12 ratchets and could have used a bit more character development. So much so fast that you could barely get the story put together.I'd skip it.
3,Not too bad,"This movie is pretty good, but seems confused as to whether it should be like Syriana or a basic action movie like Shooter.The action scenes are well handled, but the drama scenes are sluggish and you get the feeling they are trying to put too much buddy-buddy into the movie - with endless wisecracks that don't feel realistic.Not bad, but not great either."
3,Action Packed,"This is an action packed suspenseful film, which gives incite in to the current situation in the Middle East and world. The characters help to explain feeling and beliefs on all sides the Middle East question. Quite enjoyable."
1,Stupid-Poor Acting-Waste of Money,This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen especially from Jamie Fox. The movie is really stupid and poor acting. Not worth even a $1.00
4,The Kingdom,"The last half hour or so of this movie is incredible. It rivals the action sequences of any movie I've ever seen. The fight scene with Garner, Bateman, and the Saudi terrorist is as intense as anything ever captured on a film set. Every time I watch this scene I'm pulled into the struggle. My heart races, I get an adrenaline rush, and afterwards nearly cry. It's the intensity of the struggle for life at its barest form, devoid of explosions and special effects. Although there isn't a huge amount of development of the Bateman and Garner characters, there is enough to where I actually feel for them and react physically for them in this masterful scene. To me, that says a lot about both actors and the director. Well done."
4,Walked away with little insight .... but a great emotional ride.,I just finished watching this... and it was powerful. Not very educational but the struggles in each characters life is heart felt. I was very upset at the death of a particular officer towards the end. I guess it goes to show that war is never ending. It is wired into human nature and though our emotions are so resistant....it is a given fact of the laws of survival.But all we are saying ...is give peace a chance.
2,"PETER BERG, OPUS 4","** 2007. Directed by Peter Berg. When a terrorist attack kills dozens of American citizens in Saudi Arabia, four FBI agents are sent to Ryadh to find out who's responsible for the killing. Very weak effort from a director who gave usVery Bad Things,Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)andThe Rundown (Widescreen Edition)a few years ago. The camera work is ridiculous, the screenplay inept and the message conveyed by the film questionable to say the least. I felt like watching a 110 minutes long episode of CSI:Ryadh, it's as simple as that. Inadvisable."
2,Mediocre film about terrorism,"The Kingdom is a mediocre movie about a somewhat suspenseful and violent FBI mission to find the culprits of a terrorist attack on Americans in Saudi Arabia.This film is a cross between a boring CSI episode and evening news videos of violence in the Middle East. The Hollywood hype about a great ending doesn't materialize in my opinion The acting is not impressive, Jamie Fox and his Saudi counterpart speak low and mumble in some scenes, so you have to listen carefully to understand the dialog.Our sad emotions about the brave Americans who lost their lives in the Middle East and on 9/11 (we lost a young serviceman from my city two weeks ago from a roadside bomb in Iraq, and several people from my city were killed on 9/11) won't allow us to completely dislike this film due to the revenge aspect of it, but this is not I movie I would recommend."
4,Cool flick,A god movie with a lot of talking. The begining really blows you away! Mostly slow but the ending is good because it is all out action. A nice pick up. Shows you what our soilders went through over there. Action over the top but it was cool.
1,Very Disappointing,"Perhaps Priestley's discography is valuable, but his short biography is a meager contribution to ""Ornithology."" And stylistically, the book is no tribute to Bird. By all means, read Russell and Giddins--and wait for something better to come along."
2,Great features; LOTS of problems,"It ran okay for awhile, but it's gone down 3 times in the last 30 days. Only solution was to rebuild the share, which is VERY time/labor intensive if you have a lot of data. Also, the automatic backup feature has never worked reliably, and their tech support pretty much left us twisting in the wind on that and other issues. We will never buy another product from Buffalo."
4,Good for Days when time is Limited,"I actually like this better than I expected. Although the exercises are limited, they are challenging with a heavy bell (I use 12kg). I particularly like the squat/snatch combo. However, I agree with another review that a time clock would have been helpful. Nevertheless, this DVD is great for days when I want to get an intense kettlebell routine in without completing one of my longer routines. Additionally, the video is chaptered well--I throw in the abdominal segment after one of my long cardio sessions with Amy Bento, just for fun :-). It's an easy way to get in a few swings (at least 100) without doing the entire workout. Thumbs up!"
4,Simple but challenging into to kettlebells,This is a great into to working out with kettlebells. The moves are simple but you'll be surprised how high your heart rate gets and what a great workout it is. It takes up very little room so you can do it infront of the tv.
1,2 pages NOT 8 pages,"Expected 8 pages from the details. However, it only contained 2 pages, 2306 words, one fourth the content. Was informative with many citations."
4,I'm surprised,"I listened to this album and its got some great songs on it, however I'm very surprised over one song omitted...Loving Every Minute! I love Mark Wills but for the life of me can't figure out why this #1 song wasn't on this album.I recommend this album for any Mark Wills fan or even pop fans who've heard his song Back At One sung by Brian McKnight."
5,Greatist hits cd review,"I really enjoyed this album. There were some old favorites of mine on the collection, and some new ones I liked at first listen.Artist had a smooth voice."
5,Mark Wills Greatest Hits,I ordered Mark Wills Greatest Hits and the service was excellent and the experiencewas easy I wish all orders would go so smooth
2,Needs a BIOS update first!,"If you are planning on using a SoundBlaster X-Fi Extreme Music or Platinum, don't buy this motherboard until BFG or Chaintech (the true manufacturer) release a BIOS update to address the PCI enumeration problem. Other than that, it's a pretty nice board, but the Chaintech version can be had for much cheaper."
5,DIFFICULT CHOICES,"MANDY'S devotion to her grandmother brings her back to live with her in Durant. Meeting the doctor who prescribed Amanda's return after her Granny endured a brief hospital stay, leads to Mrs. McDermid's unique skill at conveying internal feelings. The reader is aware of Amanda's tension. The dctor is sometimes overwhelmingly ""macho"". The relationship unfolds a deep, delicius desire between friendship and new opportunities. Amanda, a secretary in business, accepts a teaching position because of an unexpected turn of events. Mrs. McDermid gives us another career novel highly commendable for young women about to enter the world after college.Mary Kelly Toms River, New Jersey"
5,Excellent Knife!!!,"This is one of the best knives I have purchased! It comes directly from the factory razor sharp. It is a very well-built, solid knife with a hefty feel. The locking mechanism locks the blade into place with no movement at all. It is slightly larger than the average pocket knife, yet is not over-whelming. The design of the blade and locking mechanism makes it easy to open, whether with one or two hands. The handle has a nice feel to it that should handle well even when wet. The belt clip is easily removable with a star-shaped allen wrench to be able to be moved to the other side. The knife can be easily disassembled completely to clean any dirt or debris from the inside."
1,An American Voice - Music of Randall Thompson,"Disappointing. The timbre is shallow, the chorus is out of tune, there's a great deal of ""wobble"" in the sound (related to why it's out of tune?) and the sopranos could shatter glass with their tone. Avoid."
1,Should have listened...,"Randall Thompson is one of my favorite composers, and I was on the lookout for a good recording of ""Peaceable Kingdom."" I read the review prior to mine, and didn't believe it - it couldn't be *that* bad. No offense if any of the musicians on this recording read this, but it IS *that* bad. It is painful to listen to. Do not waste your money!"
3,Nice Music,"I love Randall Thompson's music--I bought this for ""The Peaceable Kingdom"", a nice piece of music I sang a few years back with the Roanoke Symphony Chorus--this recording is not very good--there is obvious coughing, page turn noise, etc in it. There are also blaring incorrect notes sung. The overall pitch gradually gets flat. I wish I had bought a copy of the CD from when I performed it."
1,Disappointing,"While I love the music of Randall Thompson who is an exceptional composer, I was disappointed with the performance of the choir singing this music. Don't purchase this CD, look for a more polished choral performance."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"This is one of the worst choirs I've ever heard - no blend, bad vowels, a ""choral"" tone that could cut through a steel plate, and pitch problems too numerous to mention. There is absolutely no musicality, just a group slogging through notes on a page. The dynamics are mostly loud and shatteringly loud, with the loudest sections being beyond the control of the singers. If you're a fan of Randall Thompson's music, don't buy this CD."
1,BAD!!!,"i purchased this CD becuase my choir was performing a song from ""A Peaceable Kingdom"" and this was the best deal they had out there on the complete work. Well, you get what you pay for! Horrible, absolutely horrible! the women, sopranos espeically are just horrible and go flat in EVERY SONG!!! I eventually found a better copy of a similar CD. DON'T BUY IT unless you want an expensive coaster for your beer like i use it."
4,Japanese mentality at its best,"My daughter advertised to me this less known piece of cine-art. I was intrigued and ordered a DVD for myself. It should be shown to every civilized person! The film is not just well-designed and beautiful (and it is indeed!!!) - it shows special Japanese mentality concerned with sometimes very vague notions (for Europeans, alas) like nobility, trison, responsibility, good and evil, word of honor, and lot of other ""nonsenses"". Although the plot is not very complicated, the film could- and must be viewed many times!Highly recommended!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"much in the tradition of the good martial arts/samurai movies (yojimbo, one-armed swordsman, zatoichi, etc), this is very well done. to make it more interesting, it was based on a real life incident. well acted, good story development and film well paced."
4,This is an OK book,"Actually I bought this book to my husband, he is a great illustrator and comics artist, he likes to buy this kind of book looking for new ways of drawing the human body... He got two or three new things from this one, what is a good sign... Well, no complains at all. It made us buy the ""Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing from Life""."
3,"Decent, his other books are better","There's a compilation book of this artist and his six other books put together, and this book was left out. After getting it I can understand why, since this book is rather thin, and has little in it that you can't glean from the others. It's nice enough, but if I had to chose between this and one of his other books I would chose The Human Machine or one of the others."
1,Utterly Useless As A Drawing Guide,This book is actually less than useless in that the sketches included are just amorphous lines on the page. Chickens scratch the dirt more legibly.
5,A Wonderful Book!,"Henry and his best friend Thelma Fung live in Chinatown, New York and help a kind old man make kites. However, Tony Guglioni and his gang of friends of Little Italy, who don't like Chinese people, keep destroying their kites with rocks. Finally, Henry has had enough. He gathers his friends and meets Tony's gang head-on. But there may be more than one reason they are throwing rocks...With a realistic, non-violent ending and gorgeous paintings, this book is a amazing, unique read. Review by Sarah"
5,lucybgucy,This is a really good children's book. The story is interesting and enlightening and the illustrations are beautiful. Both parents and children will enjoy this book.
3,More Expected,"Heh!, I do miss that sweet grooving guiter in Better days Ahead. Guiter on tracks like Third World and that R&B rythem of Facts of Love is really missing here. More of those tracks won't be bad Norman. Just between us, this album is'nt that so good but lets hope for better days ahead."
2,Just Between Us,"Good debut CD. I was a few years late in getting into Norman Brown. A few years after he released this I copped this, and throughly enjoyed it. Fav cuts, the title cuts, and the remake of too high(with Stevie) I got all his CD's, and along wth Ronny Jordan, is my Fav artist in this genre."
5,SL-4007 CD Case,Very unique and efficient design. This will withstand a lot of abuse. We are very pleased with it and the color was a perfect fit for our new car's paint detailing.
4,Vibrant and informative.,"""Ghost Trains of Tennessee"" is a vibrant and informative study of various short-line routes ""that have been historically indigenous to the social and economic background"" of Tennessee. Elmer G. Selzer examines such colorful lines as The Jerkwater, The Tweetsie, and Tennessee's own Nashville & Chattanooga. From the turn of the century to the early 1970s, these lines transported everything from people and timber to tobacco and stock cars. In the 1920s, the routes covered more than 4000 miles of track. By 1975, the coverage had dwindled to 2,969 miles. Selzer movingly details how improved automobile highways and the depletion of logging resources caused the demised of many of these rail lines. The book contains multitutes of historic pictures (b&w and a few color); and the maps, charts, and paintings are large and sharp. Selzer's two other classic volumes are GHOST RAILROADS OF INDIANA and GHOST RAILROADS OF KENTUCKY."
2,"Poor Quality, but I guess you get what you pay for!","These sheets aren't at all what I expected. There is no heft or thickness to them at all-- when you hold them up to the light, you can see right through! I guess they will be fine for what I got them for- to go on our air mattress when we go camping, but I wouldn't use them for everyday use!"
2,Very Big,"this looked like a good idea to keep people on our bike rides together if we got separated. However, as soon as they were put on the team captains we all started to laugh. I would never wear this in public. It would be a cool idea if you were alone and wanted someone to talk to (which we did) but the speakers on mine stopped working after two weeks. Thinks twice before buying."
4,its not a waste of money or time,"This book is a pretty good read. It goes further in depth than the previous Gothic lit book which I reviewed. This particular book goes into better detail and begins to get more specific, while citing specific details and excerpts from classic Gothic texts. This book was required for one of my lower level English lit classes so I had to purchase it, I don't regret purchasing and will probably keep it after the class is over."
1,Midget restoration,About as helpful as a comic book. Pictures look as if they were taken by a blind five year old. A complete waste of money.
3,Too broad...,"While the book is nicely written, it is too broad in it's scope of the different vehicles and not specific enough in many categories. It also provides way too many photos, and restoration comments of vehicles that were badly damaged, which is not necessarily the case with good, clean restorations.It would be a far better publication if (they) had addressed the individual vehicles; Sprite, MG, Midget in separate manuals. It also would be much better in color.Overall there were only a few categories that were specific to a Bugeye, and in those only a few were specific and detailed enough to be of help."
1,"WATCH OUT, 30 pages are missing","Great book, and Zakk rules, unfortunately it is missing 30 pages!!! So you better be careful with ordering it. You might suffer from it too.Does anyone know how to get a refund or a new book from Amazon???Cheers,Sid"
4,old timer knife and sheath from amazon,i love the knife and also how fast i recived it the only thing wrong was the sheath was cut down th side causing the blade to be exposed but other then that im ok with it
4,A lot of knife for the money,"This knife is made of 1095 carbon steel. I cut meat for a living at one time and also love nice knives. I wish I could afford some knives made with the exotic steels. This little knife is the best bang-for-your-buck I've found in a long time. If you know how to use a butcher's steel, you can skin and clean animal after animal with only a few occasional swipes down the butcher's steel to keep the edge straight. Anyone who is the least bit familiar with good cutting blades will appreciate this fast-looking little knife."
2,Not bad for the price but its chinese and no longer american made,love the style of knife and I have an old one just like it that was made here in the USA. The newer schrades are cheaper and cheap built. Their quality has gone down and you can even see it as compared to its older american made cousins. honestly i hope schrade burns for this. if i would have known it was chinese made i would have looked elsewhere. heck even the sheaths are not real leather anymore and the quality of them are way down. as for price vs product it is priced just right. if you want a decent knife blade with cheaper made handle and sheath this is for you. another chinese low quality former american product. what a shame
4,Good Old Timer,Had one of these when I was a kid many years ago. This is a very honest re-make and a decent knife for very little money. It won't get a lot of use from me but I like having it in my collection for old tim(er) sake!
3,Schrade no longer made in USA,"Please note that while everyone here agrees that the original Schrade Sharpfingers are excellent knives, the company went bankrupt in 2004 and sold their name to Taylor Brands, which now uses the name on Chinese-made copies of their old design. These knives are no longer made in USA. A quality comparison might be found in the difference in going price between the original and new knives on auction websites."
2,schrade knife,"used to like this knife years ago. i lost it ,bought this new one and i think they switched to a very cheap metal for the blade. i don't recommend this to anyone."
2,Not as advertised,"The knife itself is very nice, but the advertised full grain leather sheath is a cheap plastic imitation. Yes, I know the sheath is a minor detail, but it is definitely not as advertised both in print and by the pictures accompanying the item."
4,Bostitch Roofing Nailer,"I had an excellent experience with this tool. I'm not a contractor, but I put on a 15 square 7x12 roof with it and had no problems. The only issue I had was that the instructions referenced a safety, but I could not figure out how to turn it on.I don't know how well this gun would stand up to ""52 week a year"" use, but it did a great job for my purposes."
5,great product,Great value. Have used this gun on a few jobs now and no complaints what so ever. Any failures during this time have been human error. will definitely purchase more of this gun.
1,Stay Away!,"I thought that the bad reviews that I had read on this gun were the exception. I thought that the odds of me also ending up with a ""dud"" were very low. Wrong! I bought mine at Home Cheapo and got about 1/3 of a coil of nails shot and then it just quit. And more than half the nails I shot were either jams or didn't sink all the way. Junk! Stay away! Completely blew the job for me. And to add insult to injury the girl at the return desk implied that I bought it with the intention of returning it after the job was finished. It took all my strength not to insert the tool firmly into a particular cavity of hers."
4,not bad at all,Got this gun in the kit with the cap stapler. works great so far. This gun gets used almost everyday from April to October. Had a few minor problems but that's to be expected with it nailing 10k nails every couple of days. The biggest issue i have with this gun is that it didn't come with a case like most others do. But would still recommend it to anyone.
2,bostitch nailer,stopped working after 25 squares was able to get working again spring behind trigger fell out would not buy bostitch again
2,Stay away from this gun ... you have been warned.,"I rented this gun prior to buying to make sure I wanted it. The rental unit worked great. Sure I had to set one or two nails manually and had at least one jam in every coil ... but isn't that the norm? So I purchased this gun from a local hardware store. What a mistake! The Bostich I bought (RN46-1) jammed every 10th nail and I had to set one too many manually. It took a 20 hour job and turned it into a 40 hour job. Needless to say when I returned the gun the first comment I got was, ""Well you need to use Bostich nails."" What? Are you kidding me? So I took my refund money, came here to Amazon and got the Hitachi NV45AB2, used the same box of coil nails and went to town on a roofing job. 20 coils later and I have yet to jam or manually set any of the nails. Do yourself a favor, stay away from the Bostich."
1,Horrible!,There is a reason that Mick Harrison has written only one book. Banana Thinking is poorly written and full of baseless assumptions. His rambling and incoherent thoughts are astounding.Do not waste your time or money.
2,Not what I expected...,"I was very excited for this DVD to arrive in the mail the other night, and I agree with all the other reviewers! What a disappointment. I have to be honest... I had a feeling this would be bad! I knew it wasn't an official Britney video. It was cool to see other people's point of views in bits and pieces, but it got old REAL quick. At times I was wondering if the people in the DVD were rooting for Britney or against her. Also, for a DVD that is releasing in May 2009, this only covers Britney's music career up to the ""In the Zone album"". Blackout and Circus are no where to be found on this DVD! Not worth it. The title is very deceiving, because this does not talk about her return although it honors it."
2,Indoctrination begins young.,Looking for some good homeschooling texts? Here it is. Adam and Eve riding dinosaurs. Get the kids started on the road to denying actual evidence early. Warning. May cause failure of 2nd grade science classes in actual school.
2,Confusing for children,While the pictures of the dinosaurs are interesting and kids will enjoy coloring in this book-there is a huge flaw. This book clearly states that man probably lived with dinosaurs and each picture has a likeness of humans and dinosaurs cohabitation as in the flintstones. Yes biblical scripture is included as is the authors interpretations. I do not recommend this book-it will only confuse young minds.
5,Definitely Not Indoctrination,"This is a very informative coloring book with scriptural reference. It's not what the secular text books teach, but rather a very indepth reference to Biblical doctrine. All of the captions are based upon what the Bible teaches and not what you would typically learn from our society today. I would encourage parents to take the opportunity to read the captions below each picture with their child as they may have questions or need further explanation. It does go into some detail that might be difficult for young children to comprehend. Definitely a great book to inspire some Bible study with the children. The pictures of the dinosaurs are realistic and educational. I highly recommend this coloring book to anyone looking to educate their child with Biblical doctrine."
4,A Must-Read for Feline Fans,"What a fun book this is for cat lovers. I plan to give it as a gift to my many friends who have cats in their lives. After reading this book, one will never look at a cat the same way again. Woody and friends weigh in on so many of the major topics of the day and they sure make us humans think about things we used to take for granted in a whole new way. What a fun, fresh inviting book!"
5,Tugs On the Soul!,"What an absolute delight this book is! As a cat owner I was amazed at how the author was able to put down on paper the mind musings of our furry family members. I have read this book so many times...just opening to any page and it can always warm my heart, make me laugh or make me cry. I have gifted this book to many cat owner friends and family and they agree that this is a ""must have"" in any kitty household!"
5,"Charming, smart and well-written",I just downloaded this book onto my Kindle (didn't see a single typo as someone noted in an earlier review). Charming insights into the minds/behavior of our feline family members help cat-lovers interpret the seemingly undefinable kitty personality. Our cats have so much to tell us!
3,"old, not new, micus","This cd, though only recently released, comes from material Micus recorded back in the late 1970s. Though in some respects a typical Micus production (lots of exotic instruments played with a free, almost improvisational outlook), it lacks some of the emotional focus of his later works. Still, there is some interesting stuff here, and it can be recommended at the least for his fans. For a first purchase, I would recommend ""The Music of the Stones,"" ""Darkness and Light,"" ""The Garden of Mirrors,"" or ""To the Evening Child"" instead."
3,Worm your way toward the 'Add to Cart' button!,"'SQUIRM' is a fun little Drive-In-style horror flick that plays it straight, while having a load of fun along the way. The wonderful commentary by the director mentions the fact that 'MST3K' didn't need to parody the film on their show, when the film was a 'goof' from the start. I couldn't agree more. This film does what movies like 'Scream' did several years later, quite successfully: It sends up the horror genre, without, dumbing down to its audience or having too many ""wink-wink"" moments. The film uses close-ups of real ""monster"" worms and has a memorable moment with early Rick Baker effects: ""Worm Face."" All in all a very fun movie written and directed by Jeff Lieberman, who this fan hopes will make more movies very soon!"
4,A DVD zone IT'S SMALL BUT IT BITES,"I've always liked this movie. Not because I'm particularly interested in the fascinating life of our little friends -the insects- or because I'm a curious fisherman; no, simply because SQUIRM is an above average B movie with great horror scenes and well written characters.A scene will, if it's necessary, show you a bit of director Jeff Lieberman's know-how. Near the beginning of the movie, the main character being quietly speaking to his girl-friend, a terribly long worm (yeech !) quickly crawls down the wall behind him. Without his noticing. You spend the rest of the scene wondering whether the worm will attack the hero. Stressing.The copy presented in this MGM DVD is perfect and deserves to stay in your library if you're interested in cult movies."
2,CRAWLING SPAGHETTI,"WARNING: DON'T EAT SPAGHETTI WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE!Truly, there are times when the masses of crawling worms look like spaghetti with beef sauce..yuck! With that said, SQUIRM is a pretty disgusting if effective little film. Filmed in Georgia with plenty of thick Southern accents, this movie posits what might happen if a massive amount of electricity was discharged into the earth. What results in this movie is a massive amount of hideously ugly flesheating worms that dessimate the little town of Fly Creek, Georgia. Relatively slow moving, the movie's climactic scenes do pack a slimy punch. Don Scardino, who got his start on soap operas, makes an unlikely leading man with his moppish blonde hair, thick glasses and gangly physique. The rest of the cast of unknowns are reminiscent of community theater actors and the overall production is rather shoddy and unpolished. But there are some gruesomely effective worm attacks, so it's not a total wash."
2,"Fully deserving of the MST3K treatment (SPOILERS, I guess)","I am at a loss as to how anyone could enjoy this movie, but okay. Overly southern family confronts rubber worms with staples in their mouths, and all the main characers survive except creepy hillbilly Robert and vacant-eyed mom, who appears to have been pulled straight out of The Glass Menagerie. There's also a sheriff who looks like a gray-haired Randy Travis, and - get ready for a new and innovative horror movie concept! - doesn't believe anybody who tries to tell him about the worms.A strange, strange, creepy concept, badly done. And I'm not just saying that because of the heroine's upsettingly static hairstyle, although that's part of it...how on earth did she keep that Disney princess coif in her orangish bangs all through the ordeal? We may never know."
2,A movie for everyone,"Lightning releases killer worms on unsuspecting locals including scantly clad girls.This film polarizes people's opinions. It is either so awful that you like it or so awful that you don't like it. I personal found it difficult to complete. You could easily mistake this for a Lucas film. It has family interaction, a down to earth challenge, and an electrifying effect on the landscape. There are several ""stay in the car scenes"" and plenty of opportunities to say, ""don't do that"".So reiterating, for some people it will worm its way into their harts; for their people it is a gross opportunity."
3,I was in the movie!,"Not much of a review, but look for me as a passenger in the bus scene, my mom too! Yes, it was cheesy, but the entire crew was a great group of New Yorkers who stayed at my Dad's motel that summer-what a great time and experience! It's fun to see Scardino, Penelope, and Peter in bit parts from time to time. Did you know that Edgar Lansbury is Angela's brother? Let's have a reunion! Whatever happened to Darrell Jonas?"
5,A cult classic!,"I have looked for this movie for so many years because it was one of my favorite all-time, scary/funny, drive-in movie. The special effects are so hokey-- yet they are great because they are what they are-- B-movie genius. This movie is a must-see movie for anyone who claims to be a cult movie fanatic. If you have not seen ""Squirm,"" you have not experienced true art!!!!!"
2,Pretty Bad!,"I too saw this movie on MST3k and I thought it was pretty bad!1. It's set in GEORGIA and has BUCK-TOOTHED ACTORS. 2.It seems to try to be a horror classic or something and totally fails because of its stupidity. 3. The whole ""electricity and/or radiation transforms harmless animals into giant creatures that terrorize a town"" plot has been used a million times before in American AND Japenese films. Godzilla, anyone?I would have given it 1 star but the BUCK-TOOTHED GEORGIAN ACTORS made it kind of funny."
1,CALLING ALL MST3K FANS!,"I HAVE GOT WORD THAT THIS MOVIE WILL BE ON MST3K IN AUGUST,DONT KNOW WHEN,BUT ITS AROUND THE FIRST OR SECOND SUNDAY.STAY TUNED FELLOW MST3K FANS"
1,Very slow-moving,"I am a very patient movie watcher. I let the credits linger and I panic if some body trys to talk to me right after a really great movie has ended, because how am I supposed to know what I think of it if I'm still soaking it in? Squirm has pretty much nothing to soak in. It's a talkie. It's all talk, really, and it is so slow-moving. It's just a terrible waste of time, and I waited for it to get better and it never did. By the end I couldn't get my self to watch the extra features on this disc, because I just really wasn't interested."
3,Ooogie......That about sums it up.,"I first saw ""Squirm"" back in the late 70's when I was probably 8-10 years old and it really creeped me out. For some reason there is just something about this movie that sticks with me. I link this to other 70's cult classics like ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" or ""The Pack"", that should have been just awful, but for some reason the movies just work. The acting is awful, the special effects are laughable, especially the close ups of the screaming worms, but you can't help but get a kind of oogie feeling watching this movie. Maybe because it was so low budget, like ""Boggy Creek"", that it works so well. And the creepy theme music with the little kid singing against an almost out of key piano is pretty chilling. I would definately recommend you rent before buying though, as I seem to be in the minority of people who like this movie.....or better yet get your hands on a copy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, and watch Mike and the bots tear into it."
2,It Crawled Out Of The Woodwork = 2.5 out of 5 stars,"If you can get by the story of how the ""energy creature"" was created after a cleaning lady used a vaccum on a dustball, then this is not that bad of an episode (and the creation is really not that important). The wacko doctor manipulates his staff toward where his ""creature"" is kept, so that it can feed on their energy and help it's survival. Eventually, too many people get involved and the cops get the word, which leads to the ending confrontation, in which ""all the beans are spilled."" The episode's creature looks like the ""cloud"" from ""The Man With The Power."" The episode has solid acting and a nice wierdness to it.thank you for your time, David"
3,Each panel too small for my needs.,"I was very optimistic about this product. In fact, I bought 3. I found that squares were a bit too small for my needs. I also think that you might smear the ink when moving the panels. I returned them. I think that you are better off getting the larger 4 month calendar from Quartet."
5,Go-Go Get This Mystery!,"You will love this groovy murder mystery! Who wouldn't love Bebe Bennett and her spunky, naive personality. When Bebe and her worldly stewardess roommate have dates planned with two members of the new British rock group Philip Royal and the Beefeaters, their plans come to an abrupt halt when they find Philip dead in the bathtub.Darlene her stewardess roommate is the main suspect! Bebe jumps in and tries to help clear her friend's name even though her Daddy and her sexy, blue eyed boss who is vice president of Rip City Records are totally against her sleuthing.But she must find out who the killer is before the killer finds her!This is such a fun, delightful book that I just couldn't put down! Can't wait to read the next one!"
5,Get Sidekick,"I have to agree with Justin above. I've recently introduced a D20 group I play with to Hero using this product. It's alot less Intimidating than the core rules and it's easy to use.It's cheap and it's still out there, I saw it on the shelves of my local gaming store just this last weekend. If you've ever wondered about the Hero system ans want a cheap intro this is the way to go."
2,Strange play,"This is a very strange play and is very difficult to read if you are not proficient in the French language. If you take the time to delve into the details of the plot you can find a lot of interesting parallels to current social issues. Overall if you're looking for a light read, this is definitely not the right choice for you but if you are into deeply philosophical french work, by all means read it."
2,Woefully lacking in illustrations,"For a book about a great work of art, I would have liked to see some great reproductions. No such luck."
3,A text for bland reader.,"Dull, does have the basic facts. But is a lesson for future writers. Do not write under the reader level.. The book is helpful with Appendix and is family freindly. Okay for church groups, schools, and retired folks. drawings and photos are a bit too safe."
1,Kindergarten,There are other books available that offer a lot better information than this. YOU could have written this book. Pass this one by.
1,"Simplistic book, poor value","This is a disappointing book in many regards, the most notable of which is that it has little useful information beyond the obvious. The written text itself is superficial in most areas. Illustrations look like they were drawn by a not-too-talented middle school art student. The one page Resources table, shown on page 135, contains a list of about two dozen web sites such as the Red Cross and [...] that is almost laughable; aside from various government web sites for the Centers for Disease Control and FEMA, which are listed here, there are thousands of very detailed web sites with useful information on many survival and preparedness-related topics. I would rate this book as a zero except that Amazon doesn't permit a zero ranking."
3,Basic Common Sense,"This is basically a common sense how-to survival manual. Not a book that you have to read word for word, but could be used as a basic check-off list and possibly remind you of areas that need better preparation.Definitely something that could be used for the family to prepare for disaster without chaos."
2,Really Basic Stuff,"I purchased this book and was disappointed with the very basic information presented. There was very insight or specific detail on how to prepare for a disaster. Most were just generalities and themes like ""review your home insurance policy and document your household posessions."" I was hoping for more..."
4,Pure soul classic,"Despite the fact that 'In Our Lifetime' was incomplete when released by Motown, this album is still a masterpiece. All songs were written and produced by Marvin Gaye. Musically, the album is all you want from a Marvin Gaye album. Vocally, the album slightly falls short of his previous albums, most likely because Marvin had not finished his vocals on all songs.The songs that really stand out on this album are the party songs, ""Praise"", ""Love Party"", ""Far Cry"", and ""Heavy Love Affair."""
1,Political opinion VS visitors guidebook,I have a number of Lonely Planet guides and this is the only one that goes out of its way to make political statements about the country. Along with that is the poorly researched information about what to see and where to stay.Shame on Lonely Planet. They are unquestionably the best guide books around except for this one.
2,Superficial,"I am a LP fan, but after been living in Israel for almost 3 years I have to say that this guide is very superficial. It could be much better ... for example, there are restaurants that everybody know in Israel, very popular, very nice that are not mentioned in the guide. I would expect something more from LP ... sorry :("
1,Very biased -- you can do MUCH better,"I buy a guide book to learn about the country I am visiting, preferably through a reasonably sympathetic eye. I don't want cheerleading or rose-colored glasses, but I don't expect open hostility or overt political bias. But the Lonely Planet Guide to Israel and the Palestinian Territories is full of just that. The author is overtly anti-Zionist in his tone, unnecessarily political, and to me outright offensive. I DO begrudge one's political views in a travel guide! If I want a political text (and I read voraciously about Israel, from a variety of viewpoints), I will buy one.This is a terrible guide. You can do much better, and at the time of this writing, I would suggest the Frommer's Israel Guide, just released in October 2006. Anything would be better than this."
1,Lonely Planet Guide for Israel is biased,"There are so many guides to Israel.This is one you can do without.The author Matt Rees blames Israel for Arab terror without describing Arab hatred of Jews and Israel. He equates Israel with Arab terrorists like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, fails to mention Jews murdered in Arab Riots of '29 and '36. He denies the holiness of the Temple Mount to Jews and only mentions the mosque built on top of it to co-op Jewish culture. I could go on with other examples but they are rife and there is not enough space to write about all his partisan opinions. His editorializing is apparent throughout the book and gets tiring. Israel is a very exciting place that is at the core of Jewish life. Rees' arabist opinions have no place in a guide book.Don't waste your money on this book. The loneliness in the title is for the absence of truth in this guide."
2,There are more helpful books on travel,"I am sorry I bought this book. It is not a terrible book, and it came recommended, but it was disappointing. I wanted something different than the usual books, but simply put, the more widely known guide books are better and more helpful."
4,Daughter's Adventure,I got this for my daughter who leaves for Israel on 4/30/12. She seems to be enjoying it. I'll tell you more when she returns the middle of May.
4,not as abstract as a pure physics text,"This book can serve several audiences. It teaches both computational physics and the use of C++ in writing object oriented code. Clearly, if you are already know one of these topics, but not the other, then the book is a natural fit. You can concentrate on what is essentially half the book.The more challenging task is if you are unfamiliar with both. Well, it is reasonable to assume that you know some physics, say at the first year undergraduate level. And perhaps you have done some programming, in a procedural language like Fortran or Basic.The amount of abstractions, or rather the level of difficulty in this, is less than in a typical physics text that is explaining Maxwell's Equations or Einstein's Special Relativity. The physics in the book revolves around trying to compute certain numbers in an efficient manner.While from a programming standpoint, computational physics examples are given as an important use case, to help the student grasp the OO concepts."
2,Low quality compared with previous years,"This pocket calendar was so disappointing, I threw it away. I didn't want to waste money returning it. Last year's was MUCH better! The Amazon description sounded like last years, but no match. The cover had sharp edges which cut or just hurt your hands if you're reaching into your purse to get the calendar. That would be enough not to use it, but it was just much lower quality that the calendar I replaced it with from a local store. That calendar was half as expensive, didn't have HUGE shipping cost for TINY calendar, is soft-leather bound, and is laid out much better. I recommend you don't buy this calendar if you're looking for a pocket calendar. Get one from a book store if you can still find one (the calendar). Your hands and eyes will thank you!"
1,Incorrect Description,"This product is listed as unruled ""blue"" bond appointment book. This is wrong. The product has thin (see through) WHITE pages not BLUE. The paper is so thin it makes it impossible to write anything on one page that doesn't come through to the next page. Also, shipping was more than the item. I won't be ordering from this vendor again."
1,One of the worst films ever made,"I love cheesy old horror films, especially from the 80's. This one was sooooooo cheesy it wins my worst movie ever made vote."
4,Too Cool!!!,The best looking color scheme yet! Be the first on the block to have one - they're going to be hard to get! :):):):)
4,One ugly gameboy,this console is just plain ugly. dont bother buying it when you could buy a good looking normal gameboy Advance Sp.
3,It all depends,"The feeder is of reasonable quality. However, if you are buying this feeder thinking it is like the Wildbirds Unlimited feeder, you will be disappointed. They look alike but the bottom of this feeder does not snap off for truly easy cleaning like the Wildbirds feeder."
3,"Worked for one season, then nothing","I purchased this unit last year to help minimize the humidity in my basement. It's a two story finished basement, so we're talking less than 1600 sq. ft. It worked pretty well for the first season with only a few times when it appeared to be too frozen to actually work. This season, nothing. The fan runs, the condenser kicks on, but no moisture removal. I could take it in for service, but you wouldn't expect it to need it so soon, and the cost will be almost as much as a new one. Food for thought as you compare these."
2,"Effective, but NOISY!","Works very well. Removes an amazing amount of moisture in fairly little time. Unfortunately, it was designed, manufactured and tested by profoundly deaf people. It is about as loud as my old Cessna 182 without the other endearing characteristics of that airplane. Buy it ONLY if you are at least one floor away from the unit. Otherwise, get earplugs at the same time!"
2,fine for a while,"This unit worked fine for a couple of years. I bought it because Whirlpool is a brand I respect. Then it slowly went downhill in performance. After a couple of months there was no water being extracted at all. The noise never bothered me since it is in my basement. Now, it starts up and after about five minutes it trips the breaker and stops. Having read the other reviews, I am not even going to try to get this covered under its warranty. I still think Whirlpool is a good brand, but I'll stick to their washers and dryers. My advice: pick another dehumidifier that has better reviews. I thought I was doing the right thing by buying a Whirlpool and paying a bit more. This was an expensive dehumidifier and I expected it to last longer than a couple of years. I have already replaced this unit with a smaller capacity Soleus (spelling?), but I am going to have to get a second unit to keep my power tools in the low humidity that they deserve."
1,Worked for three days,"Brand new! Continuous run because it's raining a lot. Seemed great the first day, second day. Then it stopped pulling water out ( as the rain continued to seep) because the coils are frozen. No, it's not standing in water and the temperature is about 55 degress F. It supposedly won't do this, according to its literature. I'm taking it back, getting a new one from the store until I can find a better one online somewhere. Heck, I live in a big city, there should be one here. Corporate America--each store carries one brand, good or bad. I wouoldn't buy this one."
5,Role model,"Ana Laura has a wonderful voice and sound and she uses them for Christ.What a role model for young girls today and such a positive influence,too."
4,Very cute,"I love this laptop sleeve... it's adorable! Seems very well padded, it's a little long, but the shaped sides fit very snug so it doesn't shift around. Shipping was nice and quick."
4,Great for laptops,This is a really good case for a laptop. My only complaint is the that the white/cream shows dirt.
4,groovy & stylish,This is by far the best looking laptop sleeve we have found available on the international market. Easy to use & great protection for the laptop.
4,Happy overall,"This sleeve took some ""breaking-in"". So for the first couple weeks I stretched, and pulled, and tugged at it so that my laptop would slide in comfortably. But after that is was a breeze to use.It has a strong, sturdy construction. I've had it for more that 6 months and I don't see it tearing or breaking in the foreseeable future.I put my HP laptop in it. See the link that follows:HP Pavilion DV7-1170US 17.0-Inch Laptop (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T5800 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 320 GB Hard Drive, Blu-Ray and DVD Drive, Vista Premium)I travel often with my laptop, so I have used this sleeve almost everyday for the last 6 months. I have no problems so far.This sleeve will NOT replace a true laptop bag in terms of protection. It will only be good for minor bumps, such as those that may occur during travel. But this is not for protection against falls from any considerable distance."
4,Great Looks & Function,"The Built NY laptop sleeve was a good choice for the price range. I have a laptop bag with all the pockets, sleeves and multiple zippers, but I don't always need it when carrying my 17"" MacBook to a meeting or to my house. This is a great sleeve for those trips where I don't need all the accessories or the big bag is too cumbersome. The laptop fits snugly and is easy to carry."
3,Nice Material but,"its just a tad too small. I got this for my T61p but it was just a bit too tight, even though my screen size is 14.1. It took me too much effort to pull my laptop out of the sleeve, and I wouldn't want to be doing that while sitting in class."
4,Satisfied,"Pretty much what I expected. I've got a 17"" HP dv9000 and it fits it pretty snug. I was pleased at how thick the sleeve material was. Overall a good product."
1,"Short-Sheeted: does not fit new 2011 15"" MacBook Pro","The case looks cute: it's off white (would prefer pure white) with bold and bright polka dots. Unfortunately it simply does not fit the new 15"" (purchased in March 2011) MacBook Pro. I have to return it."
2,Not to Scale,"The laptop sleeve is great quality; the problem is the sizing is way off. I had read other review of this product which said that the laptop sleeve ran small and suggested that you buy a size bigger than your computer, and I did. I bought a 17"" laptop sleeve for a 15.4"" widescreen laptop and the Built NY 17"" laptop sleeve was still too small for my computer or to be specific it was still too narrow for my computer. Amazon lists the external dimensions as 16.9 in L x 11.8 in W x .5 in D. The 11.8 in W measurement that is listed is from the ends. The hour glass part in the middle is around 10.4 inches wide, so if your computer is wider than about 9.5 inches don't buy this laptop sleeve."
3,"not great for the 13"" macbook","i purchased a macbook and wanted to get a semi-protective sleeve for it. the product itself is well-made. however, it does not fit the 13"" macbook very well which causes the laptop to shift around inside the case.with that said, i would not recommend this product for the 13"" macbook as it is a better fit for owners of 14"" and 15"" laptops."
1,Too big...,"The product says that it is the correct size for the old Macbook, however, it is too large. I wanted a snug sleeve for my laptop just to protect it from scratches. But the sleeve is too bulky and it's not as convenient that way. I wish I had never gotten it. The laptop also slips and slids within the sleeve."
1,sleeve not available,Product was not available. Got an email that said it shipped but they didn't even have it. Credit card was also charged. I had to make the call three times to get a credit to my account.
2,Pretty but fits loose around the edges,"I thought the pattern and colors were really nice! However, the part of the bag that sticks out (the edges) make it so that it will barley fit in my backpack. I wouldn't recommend this bag to anyone, but if you get it you won't hate it. I think it was just a waste of money, something I should have returned but didn't."
1,bad returns,"I bought the laptop sleeve and found it to be a great sleeve, but decided that I needed something with a few pockets etc... So I called them and received a return authorization number and followed their directions explicitly andthey claim never to have received my return - so apparently I am not going to get a refund. So, now no product and no refund"
2,Too small for Dell Studio 17,"I ordered this as it was supposed to fit 17"" laptops and I loved the design. When I received it, I was disappointed to learn that it did not come close to fitting my 17"" Dell Studio laptop. After much pulling and tugging, I was able to get it around the body of the laptop, but it was at least 2"" too short to try to zipper it. I wish there was an option for a LARGER sleeve, because I do like the quality and design of the Built NY products."
3,Sad and Broken,"I like the case and was happy to have purchased it. The color is black and cream, and the interior is hot pink. However, this morning I dropped my backback with my laptop in the built case. The computer has been dented and a 3/4 inch section of the zipper on the built case was crushed. The zipper teeth just disintegrated. It was a three foot tumble! Doesn't offer as much protection as I thought and with the broken zipper, the built case is trash. I don't recommend the case because it didn't offer me any protection. Maybe it was a perfect storm of a drop, but unless Built offers something thicker, I won't be purchasing a case from them."
3,Did not fit.,This laptop sleeve did not fit my daughter's laptop. The laptop sleeve was nice but it just did not fit.
3,OK product,"I bought this laptop bag for my small laptop for school. I really love how snug it is and that it protects my laptop from ""bang ups."" HOWEVER, I have only had this sleeve for a month and the zipper seam is coming off. I am going to have to run it through my sewing machine. Bummer because I really liked it. But next time I'll purchase one with a strap so I don't have to carry it like a textbook. I have plenty of those!!! =]"
4,Great quality ... but my Toshiba barely fit,"This sleeve is extremely well built and I would absolutely love it if it fit my 17"" Toshiba a little better. I could get my laptop in (and out of)the sleeve but it took some effort. Once in, I loved the look and feel and how it made me ... feel like my laptop was protected. Just ... a little too tight. Love the quality, though!"
3,Easy to use,This fits perfectly for my HP Pavillion 15.4 inch laptop with a 12 cell battry. Quality material and easy to use. Provides a nice padding for the laptop and keeps off from the dust.
2,Tight Squeeze,"I have a Thinkpad X61, it fits into the 13 inch sleeve, but is REALLY tight. Offers great protection, but I am worried about the little switches on the outside part of the laptop. Anything that isn't completely smooth, no matter how flush seems to get caught on the inside of the sleeve. I actually may return this item if it doesn't stretch a little and get easier to get the laptop in and out."
3,"Okay, but not hearty","For the price of these cutters, can't really go wrong. They aren't too bad, but honestly, I have smoother lines just shaping stars with my fingers. After about three months of owning them and using them only four times, they began to come apart. Specifically the seam which I assume is soldered together just..let go. Didn't rust or anything it just doesn't connect anymore."
4,Review of SanDisk 8GB Extreme IV,Purchased the SanDisk 8 GB Extreme IV for use with my new Nikon D300. It formatted quickly and pictures are written to it rapidly. It was out in cold weather and there were no problems. All-in-all I am very satisfied with it though in hindsight it would have made more sense to get two 4GB and spread the risk.
3,"Big card, but slow in use","This card when I bought new it works just fine, the only problem is: card is slow for some reason. It might be that my Nikon D200 doesn't support UDMA 4, however, I didn't see any restrictions with that. I'll have to figure out what to do with this card."
1,SANDISK cf 8gb CARD,"Card often looses or does not record a particular photograph.The camera displays an error message,but when shooting a wedding this can result in a lost, very important image.I never had this problem with Micro-Drives that I've been using for years.Given the price of this thing,I'd appreciate an explanation.Or even a trade-up to a better,more reliable compact flash card.I'm truely curious if you guys will respond to this.We'll see.Thank you, Neilandjoann@charter.net"
5,Favorite author,"Purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter who LOVES books by this author. I only wish there were more, especially in the ""horse"" category."
2,Ooooooooaaaaaaeeeeeaaaaoooooeeeeoooooooh! Baaaaaabaaay.,"The extended vowel enunciation of this soulful stuff cannot help but get old after a while. This is a short album, and such songs meld together imperceptibly into a saccharine urban blurb that is painfully lacking in attitude. It conjures memories of bus stations, fast food restaurants, and even elevators at some points. No one below the age of forty should listen to this fluff unless they seek to relax into a coma."
2,one hit wonder hall of fame,these mugs made one hit ballad and fell off I never felt these mugs anyway but this is something your girlfriend will love if she still remembers these guys 702 was tight and fine as always.
3,ITS A GIFT,THIS WAS BOUGHT AS A GIFT BUT I LISTEN TO SOME OF THE CD. I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE GUYS DID NOT MAKE IT .
2,I ONLY LIKE 2 SONGS,"I BOUGHT THIS CD BECUZ I LIKE ""THIS LIL GAME WE PLAY"" AND ""FIRE"" THIS WAS A GOOD GROUP I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE DONE MORE"
3,And where are they now???,Ok I remember their song called This lil Game feat.702 and that song was the jam!!! But what in the world happenend to these guys they just up and vanished!!
5,Brings Me Back,"I was 15 when this album came out and I fell in love with it from the jump. I know I've had at least 3 copies of it through the years from having to replace it because I carried the TAPE with me everywhere I went. Some of my best high school memories have the song ""Fire"" in the background. The whole album is great. It makes me sad to know that they fell off the way they did because they had the potential to do big things. Eleven years later I still love this album and even though I'm married with kids now ""Fire"" still does something to me."
4,"very short cd, but good","THIS GROUP SHOULD HAVE RELEASED MORE THAN ONE ALBUM. I FELL IN LOVE WITH ""THIS LIL GAME WE PLAY"" AND ""FIRE"" AS SOON AS I HEARD THEM. ONCE I BOUGHT THE ALBUM, I ALSO LIKED THE SONGS ""THE BETTER THE LOVE,"" ""THIS IS NOT A GOODBYE,"" AND ""GOOD TIMES."" THE ALBUM WAS AWFULLY SHORT; YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THERE WERE 8 TRACKS B/C BOTH ""GET DA MONEY"" SONGS SOUND EXACTLY ALIKE. BUT I THINK THE ALBUM IS GOOD."
4,Found it!,"I have been looking for this CD for quite sometime now and I finally found it! When it comes to slow jamz this group has it. I remember many a female that melted for me while playing and singing along with ""Fire"". For those romantics out there this one is a MUST have in your CD collecion!"
4,Middle School Memories,I was in the 7th grade when this CD first came out. I actually remember all of the good times a had in middle school just from listening to this CD. This CD was a classic and I enjoy it.
3,Painting Gilded Florals and Fruits,I mainly bought the book to have the detailed drawings and pictures of flowers and fruit. This is a great book for artists.
4,Excellent book but horrible edition,"After watching a recent history channel show, I realized how little I remembered of the civil war from school 40 years ago. Wanting to learn more I read several books and found this one to be the best for a concise coverage of the war. However the type in the $8.95 version is horrible. It goes from dark, thick and blurry, to thin and light. The margins and spacings vary and letters get dropped or partially cut off. I did see a larger paperback edition after I bought this one. It was almost twice the price, but probably worth it. If your looking for one book on the civil war, Hansen's is definitely the one to get."
3,Not as high as pictured,"So they must have used a really short person to take this picture featured with this product. Clearly her legs are not the floor, but when I tried it and I am 5'8 my feet were on the floor and the chair was too low for my desk at work. Since there is no way to adjust the height it is not ideal for working for long periods of time. This is not a chair that you will or could spend hours sitting in because it is not comfortable and makes you work by engaging your core. This is why I purchased the chair and it is perfect for lower work surfaces. If you plan to use this in a typical office setting then this product may not be your solution. Hope this helps you in deciding if this chair is right for you. I think I will take the advice of the previous review and buy a bigger ball to see if the height increases and I am able to sit at my desk without discomfort."
3,ball is small - 50 cm -,"Hi ball is 50 cm - very small for me - 5'10"" received in black - pictured silverwell made - easy to put togethergot a larger ball = extra 25 bucks - and it is the right height for my desk"
3,literary references distracting,"This book has a good story line, believable characters, an interesting title and, on the whole, I enjoyed it. I did find, though, that the constant literary references were distracting and seemed forced. I would be interested in knowing if the author uses this technique in her other writing."
5,God's love,"I have read this book several times, it is a hard book to read at first. But stick with it. The characters are real, and the evidence of god working in our lives is throughout the book. Margaret felt she wasn't worthy of love but found that God, through Birdie, loved her. enjoy the book!"
5,good reading,"This book may not be the most riveting or action packed read you've ever had, but its a good, clean book that talks about the struggles of every day life. It builds slowly, with information being told as the reader needs them to fill in the blanks. Like I wrote, it's not an action packed book, but it does speak to the reader on a level unachieved by many stories nowadays."
5,A real tear-jerker,"I don't think I'll ever forget reading this book or the lessons I learned. There are two main characters, Margaret and Birdie, whose paths cross over a period of nine months or so. Such a short time, but the friendship that grew out of Birdie's persistent show of Christian love and patience for bitter, angry Margaret would touch many lives besides their own. Written from Margaret's point of view, looking back over those nine months with periods from even further in her past interspersed, you really get a sense of the dryness and deadness of Margaret's spirit. I don't think I've ever read such a well-written and thoughtful story. There are many literary references sprinkled throughout, but they are so essential to understanding the true nature of Margaret's personality that I don't think the story would have been the same without them."
1,Some Windflower in My Heart,"The kind of help a woman needs after being raped by her step-grandfather was greatly over simplified in this book...........go to church......fall in love with some woman...........treat your husband like dirt, never showing him any gratitude for all the wonderful things he does..........when Margaret finallylooks at Thomas's room, the worn, ragged bedspread, the rug with a hole in it, the faded,worn curtains and realized how lonely and bleak his life must be, instead of brightening his life, she spends the money buying dishes for a woman who also does kind things for her. Maybe a woman so traumitized could never respond to a man even for his kindness. Why didn't anyone suggest counseling for Margaret? Please don't recommend this book to any woman who has been raped.........."
4,Corelle enthusiast,"pretty pattern. A little too big for the table setting and dishwasher. If I had it to do again, I would have gotten the round ones."
3,Pedro's loyal fan,"I've been a fan of Pedro Fernandez since he started his career...over 25 years ago. I especially like this CD because you will find songs that he sung at different times in his career. You will find songs he sung as a child, a teenager, and now as an adult."
1,"Very bad, avoid this one","I bought many books while applying to MBA. I felt that the Business Week's book could be helpful. Yet, I would suggest that you avoid this one since it has nothing except a collection of basic information that you can normally find on b-schools' website. Do not expect real insights on b-schools (it has been written by journalists who do not know much about the real stress of MBA application), no advice to craft powerful essays that will get you in, and no tip to ace interviews!!"
2,"Very Basic, Could Be Much Better, Not Essential","This book is an adequate resource for anyone applying to Business Schools. Information on the top programs is clearly presented, but the narrative is superficial and this book cannot replace the schools' web pages. If you have access to the web, go there first. The practical information on applying is basic at best. An average starting point for anyone considering B-school. Very disappointing and expensive for what you get."
4,Comprehensive Lighthouse Guide,"Holland's book is the best available for those who plan to visit American lighthouses. It is the most comprensive guide available, featuring directions to each lighthouse and a little blurb about each one. What it does not have is great pictures. Most are quite small and all are in black and white."
4,"good, not great tool","Generally well designed, using it every day showed the weak rewind knob. Plastic shaft snapped. Drilled a eighth inch hole in the lever, used a 3/4"" #6 machine screw and locking nut to hold the knob and it should last a lifetime. The nylon string also doesn't hold as much chalk for repeat snaps without a rewind but I trade that for its other advantages."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting","Have used it on one month long project. Well constructed, but not getting as good of a snap line as I expected. Unique design makes it easier to find in a pile of junk. Is it worth the extra money? Depends on you! If you find you take good care and/or buy the best tool you can afford, it's worth it. You won't find a better chalk box in a local store."
1,For how much it is ???,Well I had one of these but It Broke a month after i bought it ... Being a Framing Carpenter I learn to adapt So I bought a Extreme Fatmax Chalkbox Took the line out and replaced it with braided mason line It works well ....
2,Don't buy this...,"This is worse than a typical Irwin strait-line from the hardware store, and costs twice as much. Gear action on rewind is very rough. I had high hopes, now I have a $25 piece of junk to toss in a drawer."
5,very worth reading,"The Story of Peter Derwent, an almost ordinary bored man as he meets Alexis Sabazius, a Man of Feeling. Slowly he realizes what it means to be human and what extraordinary possibilities it offers.A mixture of Douglas Lockhart`s diary of spiritual Experiences and an imaginative dialog with very deepgoing philosophical, poetic and mystic background. Lockhart's many years practise in Biofeedback, Hatha Yoga and Zen in which he explored the laws of Consciousness and Reality make this Book valuable to everyone. It has a very wise, honest and comprehensive style. I seldom found a Book so beautiful to read, and I had a lot. Enjoy it!""Song of the Man who came through"" is rarely available now and came out therefore 1997 in a new edition under the name ""Sabazius: the teachings of a greek Magus""."
4,cultish gem,Entertaining horror from the early 70's - though it tends to drag a little during the middle section. This is certainly the best looking version of the film I've seen - the transfer reveals loads of detail that was missing from my vhs copy.The sound though is unfortunately a bit muffled and muted.
2,The pacing kills it,"I wanted to like Raw Meat. It had a lot going for it. Promising story (mutant cannibals live in an abandoned tube station), surprisingly high production values/make-up and gore and a fun performance by Donald Pleasence. Unfortunately, it was also very dull. The director had a lot going for him, but wasn't very good at building suspense. Not really worth renting :("
2,Raw Meat. The Doors?,"Mind the Doors!This is a dark and scary film Not too scary though,At first it doesn't move along that fast,But then you find A Donald Pleasence(before the Halloween Gray Hair) Who is a Great and one of my favorite actors(Especially in Halloween)I do like Christopher Lee's Sadly Short and Brief Performance,the Cannibalism is what may turn off some(at least to me),It is more of a mystery genre movie and is boring at first,The movie is okay not that big of a deal.There is even some laughs as Donald Pleasence Drunk and Him telling the young American in the Movie to get a Haircut."
2,"true R&b can bring it can rap if they have to,people didnt no that.","but they left out alot of songs on this greatest hits cd that would have made this cd the truth,i wonder y they did that."
3,The author tried to write too much into it..,"This book should have been filed under suspense, versus romance. The book mostly deals with trying to figure how why Brynn is the way she is, and the truth about her daughter's supposed ""suicide"". It wasn't a bad book, but then again, not one I would recommend to those looking for a romance. I'm torn on this one."
5,Great book,"This is a great book. If you are looking for the FULL Kama Sutra (Not just sex positions), I would reccomend this. It has no pictures which is a downside and makes it not ideal if you are just looking for a book on positions in which case there are a lot of better books. But for everything else including biting, kissing, fighting and getting the Indian prespective on sex, this book is a great read. I have since gotten a few other books on the Kama Sutra and this one is by far the best."
1,no pictures,very disapointed to have no pictures. that was the reason i bought it. Will try another version. good story though.
2,The Complete Kama Sutra,The book was exactly what I should have expected for buying it online. I would have done better had I gone into a store to buy the book as it was to be a gag gift for a birthday present and had to go to a store and get what it was I was wanting anyway. I guess you get what you pay for and I didn't pay much for it. Lesson learned.
1,"BORING, no pics to help, and too long","This is a disappointment. This is about ancient tips on sex in Indian culture. It is long, tedious, no illustrations, just a whole bunch of text. BORING. Don't waste your dough."
2,disappointed,"More of a research tool. Unless your planning on becoming a ""kept woman"" or keeping one half the book is useless--doesn't pertain much to a married couple. Completely disappointed."
3,Alot of information...,"If you are interested of the teaching of the Kama Sutra in a no pectoral version, then this book will teach you every thing you have ever wanted to know about Kama Sutra, just with all those dirty pictures."
3,big book,"conceptually interesting, but in reality its very long and written in very old language. Written LONG before any concept of womens rights was around!"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"This was NOT what I was looking for, it has not one illustration and is written in a way that is very hard to understand. I wound up buying a different downloadable version that turned out to be much more what I was looking for. If you like reading 1st century Indian lore this might be the book for you if you want something you and your spouse can read and enjoy I'd move on."
3,Non Fiction,"The Kama-Sutra is an entertaining instructional manual, if you like. A lot of the stuff in there of course is ancient, and now will seem quite absurd, as though it was out of a story about witches and wizards cooking up potions and other stuff like that. Apart from that, though, it is quite amusing to see what they came up with."
1,A huge disappointment,"I bought this expecting a slightly titillating guide to spicing things up in the bedroom ... instead, what I got was very rough English translations of the very industrially written original. And some extra stuff I wasn't interested in, like lengthy discourses about men seducing young boys. Hugely overrated."
1,Don't waste your time,"The book teaches nothing. If you want positions, which is the main reason I wanted a Kama Sutra book, go with one that has pictures and is all about positions. There is one that has many more positions than the Kama Sutra and it's called 365."
4,"Politically moronic personal book, very well written","This is a beautifully written book by a courageous man. It has a unique perspective. Gelertner values what is important in life. But the politics are moronic. In spite of that, the book makes you think. Freddy Sweet, Ph.D. sweet@well.com"
3,Not the worst thing I've ever heard but . . .,"Its not spectacular at all either. Its just not that good. Its all on the same rhythm, which changes drastically on some of the songs, but thats not the problem. The problem is that there are 22 tracks and only 3 or so are really that good.The best song here is by Vegas Mek Me Se Di Hand Dem Sway, thats one of Vegas' best, and even though I don't really enjoy Don Yute, his song with Cecile Get It On, is pretty tight as well. After that its very mediocre, both Kiprich's records are pretty bad. Of course, Sean Paul straight toys with this rhythm just like always, but thats a given its not really worth mentioning that Watch Dem Melt Away is amazing. Chico's Don't Burn Your Bridges is decent. Other than that, mediocrity reigns. I wouldn't recommend this one, its nowhere near Juice, its not even Titanium 2000, its just there."
1,I had to chuck this one in the garbage!!,This was the worst CD I have ever bought. Every artist on the CD were singing to the same music. It was just horrible. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,didn't work for my dogs,"Wee bits is a great size kibble for small dogs. However, soft stools were the results with my two little dogs. I added lactobacillus/acidophilus but it made no difference. I called the local distributor in our state, and his recommendation was adding yogurt or lactobacillus...some dog foods just don't work for certain dogs, and I don't think you should have to add supplements just so your dog can tolerate the diet. We have since switched to Innova EVO and have great results."
3,annoying narrative,"The music, performance, and of course Hopkins' texts deserve 5 stars. However, these are interspersed with the most annoying narrative, which is worthy of 1. It detracts from the songs rather than adds to them, and is prosaic, flat and even ugly. Also, the text of this narrative doesn't set up the poems well, and is too interpretive."
2,Don't bother,"Umbrella is not rain-proof (which you'd think is okay because you don't sit outside in the rain, but after the rain is over your table and anything you may keep on it is soaked) and the solar lights only worked for about two weeks. The price was about $30 less than the really good one I wanted, and I regret trying to save a few bucks on this one!"
3,sometimes engrossing but sometimes overdone,"This book is a collection of short bursts of information, designed to give readers a feel what it must have been like to live through the bad old days of New York: in particular, the looting-ridden 1977 New York City blackout and its aftermath.I think it succeeds in its basic mission; however, it could use quite a bit of cutting down, since it contains quite a few selections of prose that are not really blackout-related and thus don't add anything to the discussion (for example: ""Some shot heroin. Some shot hoops ...Some studied: for summer school, for the real-estate-licensing exam, for the LSATs."")"
5,Worked Great,I bought and used this for my kitty but now he has gained so much weight from free grazing that I have put him on a diet. He is not allowed to eat will nilly any longer but I does the job!
1,It doesn't work.,"I bought this product for feeding my 3 persian cats while on vacation. Every day I have to force the feeder to give out more food as it sticks so I have to take a finger and wiggle the food dispenser to get more food in the tray. They gave me a refund so I bought an automatic food dispenser for $54.00, I got the petmate but bought an a/c adapter for it as the reveiews was not good whom used the batteries only, for it.I heard that regular house cats are pretty much smarter than persians and they might be able to figure out how to manipulate the food to come out into the tray. My advice is not to buy this one if you are thinking about going on vacation."
2,junk,I do not like this feeder....the food does not fall freely out of the tube when it starts to get low. mine also showed up in looking mangled and missing the screw top....took the company (not amazon...forget the manufacturer name) 2-3 months to ship me a repalcement.
3,Original is nicer,"The original Toddler Princess Ariel is nicer than this one, it seems to me, that they ""cheapened her up"" for this doll. I mean, yea, she's still an Ariel doll, but the whole color change thing is really ugly. Especially the design on her face, it just looks awful! Also her mermaid outfit is weird, it's not the same as her real mermaid outfit, the tail especially is horrible, with the purple swirl down the middle...yuck!Still, she's made very well, and if you can't get the original one, this one is ok to settle for. Maybe some people actually like the color changing thing. She comes with a purple seahorse that squirts water, a shell shaped water holder (for color changing), a hairbrush, a strange necklace, and boldly colored...hair extensions....eww."
3,"Does not include ""Sail On""","Can any album be called Ultimate if it misses a great artist cut.Nice to see ""Night Shift"" finally inlcuded on a Commodores collection, but Motown does it's all too common shabby and truncated job with this CD.You'd think the Motown family, or whom ever owns the song rights were cash poor, or something, the way they hap-hazardly repackage their choice cuts and artists.This CD is no brickhouse, nor is it mighty,mightn. but almost a winning hand."
3,A Collection but not ultimate,Buy the Anthology it has everything the original Commodores sang.It's 5 stars!
5,Great old songs,"It is great to hear all these old songs again and would recommend to all, so as Molly siad do yourself a favour."
5,Tremendous,"If you are married, or thinking of marrying, this book is for you. Very practical and sobering... it helps you think on the things that are really important in a marriage that will give great insight and forethought if engaged, or thoughts and tools to save what you may think is a failing or dying marriage. If you feel you have little or no hope, try this book. You will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Bodywork Shiatsu,"It's a fairly decent book. Need's some work however, could use a better listing and definitions in general when it comes to items that can be placed into a list as opposed to a huge paragraph that fumbles on. In the practical part of massaging, introducing a template of a massage would be helpful in understanding a routine one can do."
4,Excellent commentary by a great pastor and teacher,"This is a thought-provoking and enlightening commentary by Boice. He makes us look forward to studying the each chapter. Who would think that the minor prophets were so important and so full of such rich teaching? The only thing that could have made this commentary better is if it had discussion questions included, but it is not really a ""bible study"" it is a commentary. Enjoy this great commentary!"
5,Esceptional Commentary,"James Boice's commentaries are very different than any others I have studied. These provide a thorough expanation of the texts but are less ""technical"" and more application focused, while still fully defining the context and literal meaning of the passages. Overall, as a layman, I find these to be the most useful commentaries available."
2,No Translation,"I must first say that the papyri that are in this book are beautifully presented, and if you happen to be fluent in reading Egyptian hieroglyphics then it is no doubt a real treasure for your collection. However, for those of us who are a little more ignorant, a decent translation could have proved most helpful!"
4,very good collection,"the debarge family musically has been long overshadowed by comparrisons to the jacksons in more ways than James Debarge&Janet jackson of being together. but Debarge was able to write some of there material unlike the Jacksons. El Debarge was not only the Lead singer,but also the main songwriter of there classics.""I Like it,all this Love are played all the time at Quiet storm radio, the song ""a dream"" has made Careers out of Biggie,Ashanti,Mary J.Bliege amongest others. for a whole on Radio alot of songs were sampling some parts of debarge songs. I was hit&Miss with the More Cross-over stuff they did,but as far as Songwriting,Singing&Playing El Debarge is a really good talent that is vastly underrated.this is a good collection."
5,DeBARGE IS THE BEST FAMILY GROUP EVER!!!!!,"DeBARGE WAS THE BEST GROUP OF TH EIGHTIES. TOO BAD THEY DISBANDED. THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST OF THE BEST! EL WAS THE ""GLUE"" THAT SUCCEEDED THE GROUP. HIS SULTRY VOICE AND HIGH NOTE TENOR IS TRULY TALENTED AS WELL AS SOOOOO FINE!"
4,Great CD,"If you like Debarge back in the day you will LOVE this cd. Includes most people's favorites. Love Me in a Special Way, Rhythmn of the Night, the forever sampled A Dream.....Great cd...takes you back to your childhood."
4,DEBARGE ULTIMATE COLLECTION,"This CD was everything promised on the lable, it came in a timely mannor and was new and unused. I recomend this CD to anyone who likes DEBARGE, or 70s/80s music"
4,bring back the memories,"this album is good time music. it has great melodies, and a lot of the original samples e.g.; ""stay with me"" (notorious big's ""one more chance""), ""a dream"", done over by mary j blige and much more...."
4,great product,"Mixed with milk and shaken well it tastes just like chocolate milk. Unfortunately, no protein powder will taste great/good when mixed into water. I recommend this product; good whey protein, very palatable and the price is right."
5,Great weight set for a home gym,"I live in a one-bedroom apartment and I use these weights for my daily workout. They are unobtrusive enough to keep within the living room without disrupting the floor plan. I have never felt insecure about the stability or safety of these weights. The pin that holds the weights together is very sturdy and does not move during exercises. The pin is also easy to place provided the weights are on level ground and you are at eye level with the weights. The unique shape of the dumbbells has been a plus because it has allowed me to do exercises like weighted pushups and overhead triceps extension. The only negative about these weights is that they do make ""clinking"" noises when used for most exercises, making them difficult to use early mornings when someone is sleeping nearby. This should not be any issue in any other circumstance."
4,Solid,"Would recommend to others. Very sturdy dumbbells that allow easy storage. Price is a bit of a turnoff, however with the amount of room I am saving by using these they are quite worth it."
5,"Solid, space saving & still going strong...","By far one of the best exercise equipment investments I have made. The reviews others have written speak for this product. The only complaint I have and it's more of a nit-picking, is the metal can make a clanking sound from hitting together when performing various lifts. However, the clanking sound is definitely not loud or distracting. I've used these dumbbells through 6 rounds of P90X and they still perform & look like day 1. The labels on top & plastic color labels to slide the pins in are still like day 1 showing no signs of peeling, cracking, or discoloration. The actual pins & elastic string that hold the plates in place are both holding up like day 1. I've never had a pin even slip or even budge from holding the plates. I know they will last forever therefore will be purchasing a nice stand to keep them at a better height for R&R."
4,Powerblock 45lb,"Pro- Good weight set, saves a great deal of space, fairly comfortable to use.Cons- Difficult to adjust if not on stand"
3,Just OK,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to Bowflex Selectech dumbbells, and long story short I just ordered a set of Selectech and will be trying to sell these or else give them away.They are weights, yes, and they are adjustable. But I found them to be a bit clunky and not very ergonomically appealing. Also, the change between weights unless you're doing 10 lb increments is time consuming. There are two 2.5 lb weights in the handle, so you have to remove the center handle and remove one or both of them depending on if you want to adjust 2.5 or 5 lbs. Plus then you have one or both of the 2.5 lb weights to deal with until you put them back in the handle. A bit of a pain in regular use, but especially for me as I use them for P90X and changing as quickly as possible is beneficial.They're not bad, I just think there are better alternatives out there."
5,Great Stuff,I love having a full set of freeweights in the size of one pair! Just gotta be careful when you're switching weights because if you have the clip on a diagonal it gets dangerous and awkard.Overall it's great!!
5,PowerBlock Classic Quck Change is Great,I have used the PowerBlock Classic for about 4 weeks now and I have to say I have not been disappointed. I purchased the set because I started with the P90X exercise routines and they require you to use a number of different weights to do it correctly. The PowerBlocks enable me to change weight quickly and keep up with the video instead of having to pause and change weights. The weights feel comfortable and solid when you are doing your exercise. I wholeheartedly recommend these dumbbells.
5,Fantastic,I've had these weights for just over 2 weeks and they're nothing short of fantastic. Very easy to switch from 5 to 45 pounds to optimize a workout. I've already lost two inches off my waist thanks to these and a new diet. I would definitely recommend these
5,Great compromise,"Wanted dumbbells for home use, but not a separate pair for every 5-pound increment (would require more space, have to build a rack for them, out of place in multi-purpose room, etc.). The PowerBlocks give me 5 to 45 lbs. per dumbbell, change easily in seconds, have even weight distribution with padding around wrists, stay securely attached, and are easily stored when not in use. No complaints."
4,good quality very compact,"PROS: Very compact design works well, and seems to be high quality changing weights is easier than you might thinkCONS: Plates sometimes get stuck together if you select them improperly once"
3,ok,"I am giving the product a 3. I'm disappointed in them. They are bulky, which is probably typical for this type of weight. The pins snag on my shorts when doing curls next to my body. You can not hold them with two hands so I can't do one of my favorite lifts with them (over the head drop weights to back of neck and up). I put them on a cushioned chair instead of buying the stand and it is hard to change the weights on anything even a little soft. You can't move a weight from the left hand to right hand without sitting it down first. Just little things that I didn't think of. They are nonreturnable."
3,ok,"For a combination of fairly quick plate changes, fairly heavy weight capability, fairly short length, & ok solid feel, these will do: Although ""Selectec"", ""Bowflex"" & ""Nautilus"" change weights faster & more safely, they're too long, even when set at very low weights, & aren't available as heavy dbs. Although ""Ironmaster"" changes plates a bit more slowly, they're much more solid, have a design much more functional for a wider variety of exercises, & can be special-ordered to be as heavy as you want them."
5,FROM A 63 YEAR OLD BODY BUILDER,"I have been using the powerblock system for 12 years.......I'm a 63 year Old Special Forces Vietnam Vet.......I also hold a personal training certification from ACE........I have been trainng and body building for over 40 years.........And I can tell you that the powerblock systemis the finest dumbell system i have ever used......I use mine 3-4 times a week...I get a excellent workout, that helps me stay very fit.........And i must tell you i like the feel of the product as well as the sturdiness....of the blocks...of course you have to be careful as you would with any heavy weight set... just use common sense and keep training....I would not use another brandand I reccomend them highly"
5,So Convenient,"As expensive as this set is, the convenience and space saving we get out of it is unparalleled. Having them has made it easy and convenient for me to do multiple exercises with different weight amounts easily instead of having to purchase, store, and alternate between multiple weights. They were recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I listened!"
5,Power up your workout!,"I was looking around for a nice set of adjustable weights for p90x as my spin locks were taking FAR too long to lock and load for the quick, fast paced weight switches that the program demanded. And so after much hesitation from my wallet, I finally gave in and ordered the PowerBlock Classic Adjustable Dumbbell set. Boy, let me tell ya, worth every penny! I'm finally able to keep up with all of the work outs with only the slightest effort on my part. Gone are the days when I have to constantly pause and rewind to stay on track. It almost makes working out fun (if that's possible), haha.They're so good in fact that if I had to choose between these weights and a girlfriend, I'd choose these weights! You know why? Because I'd be so psyched to work out with these dumbbells everyday that I'd get ripped in no time at all, which means an even hotter girlfriend! ;)"
4,Great product but lack of expandability is a critical shortcoming,I purchased these on sale at a local sports store. I am in love with the design and basic concept and i was in a hurry. But I bought the ones that are only expandable to 50 pounds assuming I could get an expander kit to 90 pounds. Apparently the classic is not expandable. So I will return these and purchase the 90 pound version.
5,eye opening and tear shedding,"As a military man who joined to serve his country and nothing more, this book is a breath of life giving air. To know that I am not the only one who feels the need to give all to this country. Mr. Bennett does an outstanding job pointing out the easily missed down falls of modern day society without ever calling out a single name or pointing fingers. WE ARE ALL responsible and just as guilty as the next for the decisions that have been made concerning American Morality. And Mr. Bennett makes that point abundantly clear. I just barely got through his introduction when pride and fear began to overwhelm me. This country is in trouble and as he says in his book ""it may not have all the answers but it is a step in the right direction. Thank You Mr. Bennett for reminding me that I am an American and I have the right to stand for what is right. And I too gladly give of my time and life if required in service to this great nation."
2,"Hilarious! ""B"" movie sci-fi for narow minded snobs","This is a fairly well written book, and the author does a credible job of trying hard to link together and postulate connections between unrelated and spurrious data. So, if you are a naturalist and a fan of poorly writen and campy sci-fi, this book is for you. Read it at parties and try to appear intellectual. Truly a hilariously bad attempt at trying to seek, desparately, naturalistic origins of human intelligence. The only proof being the authors and fans of the book illustrate that perhaps they do in fact have the intelligence of lizards. Proof after all?"
2,A disappointment....The first 3 albums are better!,"Oscar's playing is great, and his first 3 CD's are some of my favorites. This release isn't as strong.The music is pleasant, but the ""Flamenco Nouveau"" style and feeling isn't in full force, on this release.True, his playing is still wonderful. But the tunes are more diverse stylistically.Some tracks sound more like folk music than ""Flamenco Nouveau"".If you want to hear some different musical styles mixed in, you may like this.Oscar probably wanted to branch out and do something different.But the resulting album sounds uneven to me.Conceptually speaking, it doesn't ""gel"" as a whole."
4,A real pleaser for nuevo flamenco fans,"Oscar Lopez's ""Mi Destino"" was mostly a hit at home here. Our resident guitar fan grabbed it out of my hands and ran to put it on. ""Ottmar Liebert on steroids!"" we shouted in eerie unison.The steroids calm down about track 3, and the album is about 30% not-so-good Latin wedding band vamping but there is quite a bit of listenable music to enjoy. While ""Seduction"" is Lopez's mega-hit album, fans will surely find some treats here. ""What's not to like here!"" purred the guitar fan to me. I like it too--it's a keeper. Just beware, that not every song is terrific. The guitar fan liked all of it; I didn't care for the galloping wedding ballroom sound in some of the cuts but I liked a good portion of the rest."
5,Herbs (RD Home Handbooks),"My daughter & I love this book. It has given us much information about the planting and caring for the Herbs we now have in our garden. We were able to pick the best spot and we are already reaping the rewards. We've found many different uses for the Herbs, which ones sooth the tummy and lower blood pressure."
4,"Challenging and fun, historical epic!","Experience ancient Egypt from the ground up as an architect, astronomer, mason and an adventurer. Even Indiana Jones would find this virtual adventure exciting, with mysteries around every turn. Discovering the secrets of the pharaoh's tomb is actually fun, and real-time learning at its best. McGraw-Hill has definately kept to their high standards, many of the voice overs are familiar stars from the silver screen. An authentic Egyptian history lesson with a modern twist. The two CD set is filled to the brim with animation and virtual landscapes, captivating games of chance, mazes and ancient puzzles. An outstanding adventure at any age."
1,Don't buy,"The picture shows a set of 5 files. Instead,you will receive 1 file, in my case,for much more than I would have paid locally.This advertisement is highly deceptive and should be changed or removed."
2,"right or wrong, I don't know.","The book code lists this book, but the author listed does not match the author of the book before me. I bought the book for $110.00 from the law school book store, hoping to take it back Monday. I cannot tell, however, if the book on Amazon is the right book to purchase so I can return the one from the bookstore. I tried to get more information, but no other information was available, so I am left thinking I will be better off just keeping the book from the bookstore, even though it may be I could get a hardcover edition for less then one-half the cost. :("
4,"Move Over Spy Kids, Billy Talbert's Got Buddy","Hicks tells the tale of nine year old Billy Talbert, and how his accidental find of a high tech backpack (Buddy) with a personality and attitude involves him in a plot involving clones and a plan to assassinate the U.S. President. Friends, Mary Franklin and Jimmy Farrell, add humorous dialog as they try to assist Billy in foiling the evil plot. Description of the action from different viewpoints and scenes keeps the narrative fast paced and the reader involved with all aspects of the action. Young readers will appreciate the realistic manner in which the characters speak, and the relationship that develops between Billy and Buddy. I would recommend this for students 5th-8th grade."
5,Great read!!!!,"""My Buddypack"" is hopefully only the beggining in Billy's adventure. Billy's friends, Mary and Jimmy are funny and well rounded characters, with depth, humor, and compassion. The language between Jimmy and Buddy is hilarious and had me laughing from their first meeting. I highly recommend this book to anyone, who wants a great story line, magical characters and a good laugh! Can't wait for the next one John...."
2,Sucks,"Did a 10-year-old draw the pictures? Come on. Poor drawings that are taped onto the frames, copied, then sent through laminator? DON'T BUY THIS or anything else from this company. You must be joking."
4,outstanding value and quality for the price.,My new Canon A80 showed up at my doorstep the day before hurricane Charley did the same thing. Fast delivery and timely.I can tell you from experiance that is does a fine job in low light and catches the action of wind blowing outside of a window during a hurricane. Excellent value and very good results. I needed something in place of my Nikon D70 for trips where I didnt want to carry a larger bulky camera but one that was reliable and very good. The A80 did the job just fine. Very happy with it. The software works well and is easy to use. Impressive images and the price is less than 1/2 the cost of the last point and shoot type camera I bought 4 years ago. I'd recomend it to anyone who wants a great point and shoot.
2,Worked good for about 1 year,"Then some dust got inside of the camera and it would appear in every pic with a light background. It is a solid performer , but not well sealed."
5,Can take abuse and still takes great pictures for years,I bought this camera new in 2004 and I haven't had a bad day with it since. My oldest son dropped it on a concrete sidewalk at one point and damaged the case but it still works like a charm. My only complaint is the relatively small screen. Hard to see in daylight especially full sun. However the picture quality and ease of use and the durability makes it easy for me to recommend.
3,Ok for casual use,"I got this thinking it would be substitute for SLR. I needed to decrease bulk and weight on trip to Europe. It was successful for that but it lacks in ability to capture special shots. It is ok for occassional user. Operations not much different than SLR. Close up and telephoto add on lens are a joke. You can buy smaller cameras to accomplish decreased size, but go with SLR if want flexibility."
2,Good Pictures but Cheaply Made.,The camera took good pictures in various lighting conditions. Color balance good as reported by various reviews. Shutter lag is annoyingly slow as reported by others. But the biggest complaint is the camera stopped working right before a big vacaction. The camera was only two years old with less than 500 pictures taken. The camera simply stopped taking pictures as if the shutter was stuck in the close position. The camera does seem fragile. I would think twice now before purchasing another Canon.
3,A80-Missing some important features,"The A80 is an impressive camera, but most typical snap shot users will find it a bit frustrating. First, it takes a long time to get an exposure reading and focus in AUTO mode. And for those who are trying to shoot children, this will be a BIG problem. Secondly, when shooting an MPEG, you get lots of time but the zoom doesn't work during shooting and the exposure doesn't change if the lighting does. You would expect a camera this expensive and sophisticated would have these features. It takes great pictures and the software is good. Buy a 256K compact flash card or you will be running our of space a lot."
1,Poor workmanship,"After 10 months use, I noticed the top cap was coming loose.I sent the camera back to Canon to get it fixed before something went really bad. Canon said I dropped the camera on it's top left which made the cap loose. After our confrontation on the phone and they wanted $155.00 dollars to fix it ,I said don't fix it send it back. After I received it back from Canon, I noticed I had a dent on the bottom left of the camera, then after I started taking pictures again , the button you push to take the pictures fell off .I wouldn't buy another Canon they don't stand behind their product. Luckly the store I bought it from will let me trade it in for a Kodak!!!"
4,Nice camera,"I have only had this camera for a few days, but have tried to use as many options as possbile to test it out. It has tons of features that must be for more professional photographers, but perhaps I'll learn how to use them sommetime.It takes great pictures. The zoom is great, even the digital zoom. The pictures are clear, all the way to 11X. On the ""auto"" setting, pictures don't take long to take or save. I have tried some of the other settings (the ones I don't understand) and they can take a little longer, but it's not that much of a hinderance.I love the flexible LCD. You can protect it when you want, or have it exposed while taking pics. It also easy to take those impromptu shots of you and your friends while you are holding the camera because of the flippable LCD.All in all...this is a great camera. I use to have an Olympus CamMedia 3.2 MP, and I thought it was a great camera, but this one is much better. Stronger case (metal), better features...just get it."
2,Doesn't work after 2 1/2 years,"Like many other reviewers, I loved this camera until it recently stopped working. It keeps telling me to change the battery pack and turns off after a few seconds. This is after I put in new batteries. The support center told me that it would be over $100 to fix and that if I send it in, I will be offered an upgrade to a reconditioned A530 for only $125.00. I checked the Amazon price and the A530 sells new for $119.00!! I guess I'll discard the A80 and try another brand."
4,Great camera!,I got this camera from Jakes nothing less than great! I had written a bad review but Jakes did a great job in making it all good!!Canon PowerShot A80 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom
4,Great camera but be warned,"I love this camera, recently had problems with one I had for about 8 years and bought a replacement used model. Buyers should be aware that the Canon A80 had a problem with it's image controls failing which was supposed to be fixed by sending the camera in. I was not aware of this until contacting them recently. If the camera is bought used, you should make sure the fixes were made prior to buying or your camera may fail as both mine did. Parts are not available anymore to fix the problem."
4,Good camera with easy use,"Ordered the camera on July 25th and arrived on 29th. Really very quick. Camera is really nice. Taken a few pictures and look good. Main drawbacks are CF card, which is 32MB which comes with the card. need atleast 256MB. Also u need battery cahrger. Instead of 4AA batteries, Canon can give atleast 4 Ni-MH batteries."
3,Defect in construction,"I will not address photographic quality because I believe that it is very good, but I was confronted with a significant, in my opinion, constructional defect. Namely, I found the CF card door being very flimsy. My camera was in my leather bag, but under what I consider a very small impact, the CF card door cracked. So, think twice before buying this camera, especially if you have young children around!"
5,Stop Here!!!!!,"I looked for two months comparing many cameras and this rose above all the others in it's market. This is very user friendly and worth every penny. I bought this for my wife on Mothers day and she loves it. Thank you for reading and please help others by keeping all of our write ups short sweet and to the point, most importanly is honesty. Thank you"
2,battery door breaks easily,"I have had the A80 for only 3 weeks and already the battery door is broken.In taking about 100 pictures, I was very disappointed at how slow it is to focus. Sometimes it seemed like it was 5 seconds between when I pushed the button and when it finally took the picture. Often the opportunity was long gone by the time the image was acquired.Otherwise, the pictures are ok, and I like the software that came with it.So, I'm off to FedEx to send it for repair."
1,the infamous e18 error,"this error does indeed exist for those you that still doubt. i purchased this camera in july of last year and just last week, the camera lens stopped retracting and the screen displayed the dreaded ""e18"" code. approximately 2 months after the one year warranty ran out...so just about right on schedule so that canon won't fix it nor acknowledge the seemingly widespread existence of it. cameras shoudln't break this easily with normal use."
1,Doesn't last: not worth the money,"I have had this camera for two years. It was a very good camera until recently. It began to intermittantly show only black through the camera and only take black pictures. Now, the camera will not work at all. Canon thinks it is a harware problem and it will be expensive and time consuming to fix. The camera has been well treated and never dropped or exposed to harsh conditions. I expected more from Canon. You can bet that my next camera will not be a Canon!"
3,Poor LIfe Expectancy,This camera took the best ever photos but after two years just quit. Never dropped or mistreated. Camera store quoted over $100 just to see what was wrong with it. That did not include actually fixing it. So sad - it did take such wonderful photos. Then purchased PowerShot S2 IS. Images not as good as A80. So sad. PowerShot S2 IS quit after three years. Changing over to Panasonic.
4,Thank God for Digital !!,"I bought this camera in December 2003 -- and I am so glad I did! I have shot hundreds of photos with this camera -- and the best thing ever is NOT paying for the ones that suck. (DELETE!) I love the quality of this camera, and the size is pretty good. I didn't get to hold it in my hand until I bought it -- and sometimes wish I'd opted for the Powershot just so it would fit in my pocket without a bulge (I'm sure my cargo-pants-wearing boyfriend would appreciate my being able to carry my own camera as well). That being said -- the only complaint I have -- is that it takes too long to snap pictures. I've missed tons of shots because the camera can't move fast enough. A friend has an HP digicam, and if she presses it half-way it focuses -- and then presses again, it takes the shot IMMEDIATELY. I really wish this one did that. But now I know what thing to look for when I upgrade someday to an SLR-style digicam."
3,OK but Craftsmanship questionable,When i received mine it was made in China. The earlier models were from Japan and they are different. you can tell just by comparing the two. Performance so far OK
2,Great Comeras Beware of Bad Customer service,"I bought an A70 which takes great Pictures the colors are vivid and it is easy to use. I purchased an underwater case for it which leaked and ruined my month old camera. Customer service was rude, blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested. The underwater case has a 7 DAY WARANTY and the camera is not covered for water damage. My father had a similar problem with his $1000 Nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason, they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. So beware of bad customer service. Canon's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the Better business Bureau"
2,Disappointed,"Purchased through amazon and although the camera takes nice photos, the presentation for purchase is misleading; does not include ac adaptor nor a card with decent memory. The one included takes 16 photos.. very disappointed and very misleading and quite expensive given the small memory card. I should have purhased it locally. I will reconsider buying anything else via internet/amazon. Nelson Martinez"
5,Buy it!,"Don't expect to see pictures in this book, just good, well-written information. This book gives the reader exactly what they need, in a cut-to-the-chase format. If the font was a little smaller and the book dimensions reduced a bit, medical students could carry it in their lab coat pocket during their ""required"" sleep rotation (ok, I can dream). Buy it."
4,Packed!,"Lots of good solid information here. I must admit I like his writing style as well. Excellent material, well presented!"
2,I NEVER expected to rip one of Tom Cowan's books.,"I have read several books authored by Mr. Cowan, and have been co-authored by Mr. Cowan.I read ""Shamanism: As A Spiritual Practice For Daily Life"" and loved it.I read Mr. Cowan's ""Pocket Guide to Shamanism"", and ""Power Of the Witch' that he co-authored with Laurie Cabot, and liked them.This book I neither love nor like.This book is only full of Celtic legends with no exercises to practise.If you are a practicing Shaman, and of Celtic descent; these legends may assist you in getting acquainted with your ancestral spirits.If you are a beginner; allow this book to sit on the shelf, and look elsewhere. I have several listmania lists that may help you get started; or E-Mail me.I encourage questions and comments via E-Mail; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,A poorly written work,"I first came across this book in the mid-90's and just recently bought it in a used book store for about five dollars. I wish I had kept the receipt. This work distorts its source materials to fit into the author's deluded notions of a European Shamanism. The writing is erratic, and disconnected from one point to the other. The author makes a point about paleolithic cultures of Europe, and then seeks to extend same ideas to much later Gaulish invaders. Bad scholarship, distortion of sources, and a whole lot of ""core shamanism"" crap all in one binding.Mr. Cowan... if you ever read these reviews, please send me my money back."
2,Nothing New,"If you're a fan of things shamanistic you will no doubt find this book of some use, although there are no specific rituals included. Personally, I am not a follower of the shaman's path, but even setting aside my personal preferences I don't feel that I found anything in this book that I hadn't read somewhere else before. If you've read extensively on Celtic spirituality I imagine you'll feel the same way too."
5,fire without control,I had been hunting for examples of conections between Shiva and other styles of worship of paradox this book simply apeared and was of emense use in defining the paradox of being a religious leader. It also increased my understanding of how I fit into my own religious background.
5,Second purchase of this toy ...,"We bought a smaller set of K'Nex for our nearly 6-year old. Wasn't sure how much she would use it. Well, oh my gosh, this child absolutely loves it. She plays and plays. Particularly bought this for educational value and fine motor skills. There are ""idea"" pictures in the kit to help. Tough construction, bright colors, and truly, hours of absorbed play. I think the child loves these a lot more than legos because of the wild shapes, giant eyes, etc."
1,Watch out,"I got two of these units to intergrate in to my cable system I have a double feed comming into my house. Both units caused interfearince on my tv's those ghost line's and snowy picture.When I disconect them out of the system the pitcher's cleared up.Theres a chance these units are notcompadable with the new high end broadband cable system, buyer beware."
2,Outdated design,"This appeared to be a great template until we got it home and realized it doesn't work with all the modern sizes. Ours was 160mm spacing, about 6"", and this only goes to 4"". Looking through the hardware store ours looked pretty typical in length and there were models much bigger. Just beware the size of your cabinet hardware and do not buy this item if they are over 4"" or 96mm. Measure Pro needs to update their design."
3,DIDN'T HELP,"I HAD TO MEASURE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MATCH UP TO WHERE I WANTED THE PULLS TO BE . I DID USE THEM TO MARK THE HOLES (3"" DIFFERENTIAL) AFTER I FOUND THE CENTER OF WHERE THE PULLS WOULD GO. I'D TRY SOMETHING ELSE IF I HAD TO DO IT AGAIN."
5,A great guide for women who forget to pamper themselves,"I'm guilty of getting too busy and forgetting to take proper care of myself, but since I read this book, I've been making a greater effort to do little things that make me feel good, and that don't take a lot of time -- like lighting scented candles in my bedroom or rubbing my feet with peppermint lotion. (Mmmmm!) This book would make a great gift for a busy friend or a new mom."
2,Too bad it had to mix theology with science,"Unfortunately, the title of this book continues the myth aboutthe true meaning of one of Einstein's most famous quotes, that""God does not play dice with the universe.&quot. Though the book was good in its dealings with the scientific matters at hand, its attempt to use it to somehow validate or push a theological agenda is discomforting. END"
1,Please,"Can we just leave God out of this, OK? Whether you're a believer or (like me) a nonbeliever, I simply fail to see why Aczel must drag God into it at all. I don't like the writing and I don't think the story is as much of a ""thriller"" as some of the advance reviews may lead us to believe. Finally, I found it very annoying that Aczel is now billed--at least by his publisher--as an internationally renowned mathematician. Well, he's not. Never was, and never will be. All that he's done is having written a previous bestseller on Fermat, which cashes in on the current craze for bite-sized and chewy scientific knowledge. While that's not necessarily a mean achievement, it doesn't make him a top math guy. So please spare us the hyperbole."
4,A breath of fresh air.,"If you are a person of faith, it is difficult to not dislike scientists who explore origins, because of their dogged secularism. However Amir Aczel in this book manages to explain to the reader an important new developent in our understanding of the universe (the fact that it has been proved to be expanding at an accelerating rate) with all it's consequences, using history, especially Einstein's work, to bring it all into perspective - and do it respectfully acknowldging the possibility that God may be the prime agency behind the origin of the universe after all, as Einstein freguently stated. No religious tome, this is a book about science, but without an adherence to an antiseptic mindset that exterminates God as possible."
2,God ?,"I get very disappointed when I see someone is trying to fill in the gaps of our lack of knowledge using God (i.e. the easy way out). In the Islamic/Koranic tradition, the author tries to explain the cosmos using God. Also the author, obviously, suffers from lack of historical knowledge or he is purposefully biased with regards to the so-called ""Arabic Science"". In page 48 he names bunch of Persian Mathematicians/Scientists and he tags them as Arab. He prefixes names such as Khayam, Khowarazmi, Biruni ... with ""Al-"" to make them sound like Arab. He must be one of those who believe the so-called ""Arabic numbers"" were originated by Arabs after Islam and not by Indians centuries before that. Validity under question!"
3,Who Cares About Math?,"Don't discount the validity of this book just because Aczel isn't a world renowned mathematician. I could care less how good he is at math. He sure is a pretty good writer though. And whether you believe in God or not...there is no denying the fact that the closer one gets to a unifying theory of the universe, the more and more one realizes that there is and always will be something curious about it that resists description with mere words or numbers. I think the title is an excellent one."
1,Not recommended,What you see and/ described is NOT what you get!Not sturdy!Looks different from the pictureDirty (very greasy).Sharp edges (I cut my hand twice)
2,review of bench legs,The ebco bench legs could stand a bet ter quality controlThey will work for what I am using them for but!They are not fitted together squarly before being rivited so it is very hard to square anything to them. The front and back are not fitted tightly so they are not square to the other membersJ A Barnwell
1,Save your $$$ - build something yourself,"Junk - absolute junk made from flimsy materials and poorly finished. One leg was already rusting, right out of the box.They are pre-assembled, using rivets, and several rivets were loose. I had to grind them off to replace with bolts.In the end, I would have been better off building something from 2 x 4 lumber.I can't seem give it a 0-star rating, otherwise I would."
5,Another Great Season!,"Law & Order is must see television! Sam Waterston as ADA Jack McCoy and S. Epatha Merkerson as Lt. Anita Van Buren created truly iconic television characters. The writing and storylines in Season 11 are smart and timeless. It is tragic that NBC cancelled Law & Order at the end of Season 20 in hopes of trying Law & Order Los Angeles, which didn't work well with viewers. The past three seasons of TV haven't been the same and the DVD releases are fantastic."
3,Law & Order Eleventh Year,"Both the tenth and eleventh year editions of Law & Order were disappointing because there were no titles or preview of the episodes anywhere. There is no information on the episode titles and plot, so I have to insert the disc, start at ""Play All"", start to watch, then start all over if I don't want to watch that particular episode at that particular time. The previous editions were much easier to deal with - that's just one man's opinion."
2,Incredibly disappointing,"I was excited when I found this book, i have always loved the fairy tale series. I only found 2 stories in the whole collection that interested me. The others seemed to be written by amateurs, had poor stories and the story by Tanith Lee didn't even make any sense."
2,Not very engaging,"I didn't find the stories in this anthology very captivating. There were really only 2 good stories in the series. I'm sure that this might be a more successful book for a younger crowd, however if you are over 35 I don't think it will have much appeal for you."
4,Faery Reel,"An anthology for young adults featuring stories and poems about faeries, an introduction giving some factual information and a bibliography of further reading.Although published for young adults, some of these stories would definitely appeal to adult readers and only a few of them are ""teen issue""-oriented. I particularly liked the Frost, Maguire, Goto and Ford stories -- the latter was especially poignant. Neil Gaiman contributes a wonderful poem that combines homage with modern sensibility. The introduction contains more solid scholarship than some similar volumes have had to offer. A few of the stories seemed clunkily written and lacking in style to me, but overall I felt this was a strong anthology."
4,Several noteworthy stories,"I really enjoyed this collection. For me the standouts were Elvenbrood by Tanith Lee, Never Never (nice re-working of Peter Pan that plays on our sympathies for the devil) by Bruce Glassco, and The Annals of Eelin-Ok by Jeffrey Ford. Ford's subtly philosophical meditation on the brevity of life was so touching I could cry thinking about it. Other notable authors include Charles de Lint, Holly Black, Patrica A. McKillip, Gregory Maguire and Neil Gaiman."
5,Excellent Product.,This product is a very natural way (without Senna) to keep you regular AND it doesn't give you any of those horrible side effects!!!
1,NO STARS - AVOID WASTING YOUR MONEY,"I am highly disappointed with this product. It does give an ""occasional bowel movement"" not any type of cleansing effect is produced. I've taken Oxy-Powder Colon cleanse and the results are immediate. I took it over night and the next morning I was moving.This Earth's Bounty is a WASTE of money. I see now why it is so cheap. You get what you pay for here. I would not purchase this or any earth's bounty products again."
3,For any fan out there....,"For any fan of New Order.. this is a great video with thier most popular music. It includes videos for confusion, the perfect kiss, shellshock, bizarre love triangle, true faith, touched by the hand of God, blue monday 1988. The video's give you the feeling of music in the 80's.. Just love it!"
1,not worth it,Do not waste your money for these items. It just feels very insecure about the connection and does not work either. Move away from these cables
4,Bruce Lee Tao of Gung Fu,The book Bruce Lee the Tao of Gung Fu was a good book because Bruce Lee hiself teaches you how to protect yourself from dangerous people. Also the style is gung fu a weapon to becoming a great skill fighter. Bruce Lee is one of the best in teachingWhen and where to srike a person that is trying to take you down. But Bruce Lee doesent want his learners to just be using the style on any body just use it when needed. Their is three types of Gung Fu you can learn but to do so you have to be very fucus to learn step by step. Reading this book told me alot I didnt know.I recomend this book to anybody or everybody because this book was good it taught me stuff that I never knew befor. I now that if somebody read this book they will feel the same way as me. If you like book that teaches you things then I recomend that you just give this book a try beacuse Bruce hisself puts hard work in makeing the reader's relax and enjoy the book. So yes I would recomend this book once again.
4,Beware!!!,"If you are looking for a ""how-to"" book, go elsewhere. Bruce was never a big fan of those martial arts books that proposed you could learn the style just by reading. Bruce meant this as a guide to help all martial artists (not just wing chun practitioners) on their journey to self-enlightenment, and to that end it serves its purpose well. This man was a genius and an inspiration not only as a fighter, but as a human being as well."
5,MAD 3 LIVE!,"We Are The Mad Crew -- (40:10) -- (1998) -- Loft Records -- LFCA-4IntroJack The ViolenceWedgeTeenage DelinquentDevilmenNapalm In The MorningDetroit U.F.O.Please Don't TouchFuzz EngineMazin GoCops Are ComingCaravanMad VikerShakin' All OverKing PyramidThe intro is an excerpt from `The Flight of the Valkyries' which plays as the band sets up. Yes, it's a live show, recorded on April 4, 1997, at Shimokitazawa Shelter. It's one of those seemingly unedited things, though someone's played with the mix a bit. The sound is rough, in your face, but when you listen to what this trio is doing, you've got to admire their killer chops. Occasionally, you swear you're hearing two guitarists - It's all Eddie! It's a hard rockin' band, playin' a rockin' set!"
1,find a better product,"The overall design is really poor, and the system is very unstable. The net is way too long and too narrow. The posts are difficult to keep upright. I don't recommend this product"
3,"Good set, annoying to pack up","After using a cheap plastic net for a while, I upgraded to this set. It's a decent set itself--solid metal poles, good quality net.Where the set falls down is in packing it up. It comes with a bag that isn't big enough to hold the poles and the net once it's assembled (the ratchets for the net get screwed on, and once on, make the poles take up more room in the bag). Also, the snaps used to connect the net to the pole get tangled in the net.I'd much rather pay $10 extra and get this set with a decent-sized carry bag and little covers for the net snaps to avoid tangling. As it is, I have to carry my poles separately and spend an extra five minutes each time untangling the net. Not ideal."
4,Good Pens with Smooth Writing and One Problem,"The assorted set provides a pleasing variety of colors. The writing action on these pens is very smooth, equal to or better than the similar Pilot G2. It seems to me that the end opposite of the writing tip, near the clip and the moving parts, becomes loose and pops up for seemingly no reason. The assembly clicks back down with a slight push, but it's still a task to adjust it. Worth the buy overall if you're looking for relatively cheap pens with good color and smooth movement across the page."
2,Not as good as Pilot G2's,"I tried these out because I love gel pens in different colors and found a deal where I got 2 10 packs for the price of one. I normally buy Pilot G2's. These pens worked great for about one month and then the ink started drying out. Many of the barrels look as if they are at least 1/2 full but I can't get some of the colors to write smooth, if at all. I've given up on these and have gone back to buying my standard."
3,No violet color pen in the package!,"I have used a Sarasa Gel pen before and really liked it, so that is when I decided to go for this product which has different bright colors. But I was disappointed that the colors in the package that I received are different from what were shown in the picture, in particular, the violet was replaced by another dark color one. And all the pens are darker than I expected. They are still good writing pens, I am just disappointed by the colors which was my intent of buy this product ...."
4,color ink pens,A handy group of colored ink pens -- very handy where you need different colors. They seem to be good pens.
5,Great pens--love 'em!,"These pens write very smoothly. I wish the company would offer a set with only black, blue and red. (I use those colors at work.) Pink and light green just don't go over very well at work. =) Otherwise, they're very enjoyable to use. I'd choose these over any other gel pens."
4,Great Pens!,These pens are wonderful. Write so smooth. Pretty colors too. Only thing is they run out faster than other pens (when you are using them a lot like I did... everyday for my journal etc.). Would suggest.
5,Good stuff and a real bargain,"A very nice collection of retractable pens and at this time a great price (under $10). The pens write well with excellent flow and adequate heft, just like we'd expect any ballpoint pen to, and lack the jiggling or drag of some ball-based gel pens. In fact, there is no particular variation in writing effort required from one color to the next. My favorite colors are a dark (and highly visible) green, and a reddish rust. I do not use these pens to write page upon page, but have been using them for over a year and none of them has failed me yet. Very strong recommendation."
4,Very touching for fathers with little girls,This book represents the how we (fathers of daughters) feel about the fear of having our little girls grow up and away from us. I'm a new father and this book drives home my priority to spend every minute with my little angel.
5,Outstanding--great to see such talent in an old classmate,"Congratulations to Jim Dodson! -- someone who I knew, unfortunately not well enough, in high school. Have been promising myself for quite some time to begin writing. You, and the inspiration delivered daily from my (new) son Alex, just might be the catalyst."
3,"A Tepid ""Heartwarmer""","As a divorced flyfisherman with a 7-year old daughter named *Megan*, you'd think I would have loved this book. Indeed, I shelled out the cost of the hardcover based on the similarities between Dodson's book and my own life. Unfortunately, I felt that the book rambled as much as their journey - it reads more like a transcription of Dodson's journal than a coherent narrative. As with any long drive, it's always touch-and-go whether the highpoints outweigh the hours of monotonous driving. That having been said, Dodson has a keen eye for detail and some of his scenes, as well as the letter to his daughter, are excellent. Just don't get your hopes up too high."
2,Not too sure about this,"When I ordered these business cards, I assumed they would be the same as some that I had previously used, but when I printed them, they came out in the wrong configuration. I wanted them to be the same as Avery 8376, but the info doesn't tell me how to format them for my needs. I like the color & weight of the cards, but need some help on how to make them usable without using up all my ink to experiment."
3,Three stars.,"This workbook is a good idea for people trying to learn the skills and techniques of public speaking on their own in conjunction with the textbook; however, this workbook didn't really do much for me while I was enrolled in a speech course & was using just the textbook. I was able to prepare my speeches without it just fine."
5,Clever fun,"Maybe we're a creepy household or maybe my two sons just identify with the brothers in the book, but my family has loved this book for a long time. The older brother's attempt to scare his younger brother is quite hilarious. But when the tables are turned on him, there is always a satisfied sigh and crooked grin from my younger son.The illustrations are quite good - perfectly paired with the text. We've never had a problem with the scare factor, in fact for us, it was a great way to show how we can be our own worst enemy when we let our minds run away with a thought. But because the turn of events requires a little higher thinking, the cleverness may be lost on some youngsters."
3,Scary,"Let me start by saying that I am not particularly interested in anodine children's fare, or over-sentimentalising. However, there were are couple of things about this book that made it less than successful in our household. First, because the story is told entirely in dialogue and no narration, it is a bit harder for a younger child to grasp the interaction between the characters. The adult reader would have to distinguish through voices if the child is not an independent reader. Second, it is quite scary - certainly too scary for our son at bedtime when he was a rather sensitive 5 year old. Nightmare territory! Other kids might have no problems, but just a warning ... The story is quite entertaining, and after age 7, say, when children are able to think more abstractly, it might be a bigger success, when kids also like a bit of terror!"
2,color not whats pictured,"Very comfortable shoe, but color pictured is way off. This shoe is made in 3 colors, brown, peanut, and black. That pictured is the peanut. The shoe sold here as Tan is actualy the dark brown."
4,Very Comfortable,"I was a bit skeptical about a slip on dress shoe by D.M. but these a very comfortable and these have the patented bouncing soles as well as a bouncy inner cusion. Some shoes with this type of padding make my feet hot and sweaty but these have not done that so far. I paid about $80 in a store for them and have received numerous comments on them from friends and co-workers which is a bit suprising to me since people rarely notice my footwear. I wouldn't wear these out mowing the back lawn or anything rugged but for business casual these are the way to go!** I thought I would add that I have had these shoes over 3 years now, worn them an average of 4 days a week and even though the soles are almost out of tred they are still comfortable. My heal has worn the inner sole fabric out and they are not nearly as clean but they're still going! **"
2,Book outdated Information,"While I'm happy with the sellers service, this book is awful. The information is outdated and inaccurate. It focuses too much on unsubstatiated risk. VBAC Companion, by Diane Korte or Caesarean by Odent are much better choices for more accurate information."
2,Outdated but has a few things in it,"The book is completely outdated. It will still leave you with a few questions, but it does have a few things to offer. Like, what really happens when your uterus ruptures and things like that."
5,Excellent and Informative,"I found the information in the book to be very helpful for someone who has had a previous surgical birth. I wish there was an updated version, but the basic premise is not outdated at all, just the specific data regarding percentages and whatnot. (Actually, the percentage of cesarean births is even higher now than when it was written, which is alarming.) Now more than ever we need books like these out there, especially since many doctors lead us to believe that ""VBAC is very risky"" and c-sections are ""generally safe."""
5,"An Excellent, well-written and well organized text","I have used an earlier edition and this edition in self-study of welding technology and as an aid in the development of my welding skills necessary for certifications. The text is exceptionally well organized and thorough. The material is comprehensive in explaining not only about the various welding technologies, but also in presenting the proper techniques and practices of welding, including great color pictures showing both good and bad practices. Every aspect of the welder's skill set is covered. Additionally, there are comprehensive end-of-chapter review questions, an excellent glossary, and a useful index, which perhaps could be beefed up somewhat. All in all, this was a very readable, worthwhile addition to my metal trades library . My money was well spent."
1,Disappointment,"I ordered this book for a female friend who is a single mother. She has adopted a child from China and, although there are a lot of books directly related to this type of adoption, there are very few that don't include something about the adopting father. I was very disappointed when I received this book. There is an entire section dedicated to ""My Parents"" with a line to be filled in for ""My father's name"", ""My father worked as"" and ""What I treasure most about my father is...."". The description of the book lead me to believe that this book was strictly about the child and the mother."
5,The KING of FUNK,"Up to 1980 my taste in music was pretty much one sided.. All rock.. When I heard ""give it to me baby"" it forever changed my world. I actually found out that I could dance. Thank you Rick, keep on funking..."
2,rick james scares me,"I know the people that are going to read this review are not going to like it, but oh well. Rick James just makes me ill (and not in a hip hop way either). For me, this is just one of those artists who I insist on passing up time and time again. It's like, there is so much music out there that is better than this so why bother. Plus, everyone knows that the true king of eighties funk is that Purple Biker, Prince.I don't know, just give me some Sonny Sharrock, Jimi Hendrix or some Miles Davis instead. Or some reggae like King Tubby, Marley, or Scientist. Maybe even some killer hip hop and electronica by the likes of (not to be confused with Rick James) Richard d. James or Deltron 3030. That's where I stand, heh heh."
2,Annoying book,"I bought this book because of the good reviews and boy, was I disappointed. I was looking for insight into expecting a second child which I am right now. However, it was like listening to another parent ad nauseum gush and tell stories about their kid. It just went on and on. Yes, occasionally I had a ""boy, that's cute and my child does that too"" - but about 90% of the time, I didn't find her stories all that amusing. Perhaps this would be a better diary so her child can read it when he's older. I just found it really annoying."
5,Make Time,"The year I had my second child I had no time to exercise, I had no time to talk on the phone with my friends, I had no time for email, but I always made time to read Catherine Newman's column at Babycenter -- it was bookmarked into my web browser. She somehow always captures the exact emotions I'm feeling -- joy, worry, guilt, lunacy, and always complete and utter love for my family. Being a parent is hard, and Newman doesn't take the job lightly, but she's able to make fun of herself (and other parents) so even the worst of times (like a barf-o-rama weekend) can be hilarious. She makes me laugh and laugh and laugh. I can only recommend that every mother (and father) own this book. But do refrain from reading it on the train or on a bus or on a plane because everyone around you will think you're a nut case for laughing so hard."
5,Lovely and hilarious,I've read this book 3 times over and it just gets better each time. As a new mom myself I found it Sweet and relatable and really really funny. Like I'm laughing out loud FOR REAL kind of funny.
4,I totally relate to Catherine Newman!,"I have followed the Ben and Birdy series on ParentCenter since its creation, and am a big, BIG fan. Some weeks I think Catherine Newman has been spying on my family, except I don't have a son! I highly anticipated the arrival of this book, and sat down and devoured it in one day. I like it almost as much as I do the web diary, the only difference that I can tell is that since the ParentCenter has no say in the book, the language is a little stronger in some instances, which I believe is unnecessary (Catherine Newman is so articulate - she doesn't need to use rough language to make her point!) The only other reason I didn't give the book five stars is it is just too short! Ben and Birdy need to grow up faster so she can write more! (Just kidding Catherine!)"
5,Must Have Texas Music,"Janet Z is soulful and deeply talented. Her music comes across as intimately as Bonnie Raitt or the Indigo Girls. The track ""Without You"" is probably my favorite. If you want something authentic and timeless check her out."
1,Written for Mormons,"I did not realize that this booklet (and it is small) was intended for a Mormon audience. I first heard about it on a news article and should have read the reviews here more carefully. There seems to be good information on the Constitution and the background that led up to it, but Mormon beliefs and teachings from their leaders are mentioned throughout, and since I believe Mormonism is a cult, I am having to skip over a great deal. There are probably many books that contain good information on the Constitution that would have been a better use of the money."
4,Along for the ride with Jeff Graft,"I'm a moderate day biker, 25 to 30 miles on flat land, so I was intrigued by Jeff Graft's fine book, Ride, in which he describes his 4,000 mile cross country ride across the US. I enjoyed the trip, and I didn't get sore. In fact, I sped through the book in one sitting, met a lot of nice folks, learned a few things about fishing and about biking long distances, mulled over a few life ""lessons"" which Jeff tacks onto the ends of his chapters, appreciated the fact that he was making the trip--not me. I praise the book's great layout design with its maps of the trip, Jeff's photos along the way, the journal style with dates and days marked, clean typeface, lots of white space. An easy read for a good cause--raising funds for conservation."
4,File folders do the job,These file folders are straight-forward enough. I use them to keep track of my client files. I would have liked a color. But manila is a classic.
2,Nice folder but expensive,The folder is fine. It does the job for me. Just be advised that you can find this elsewhere for almost 40% less.
4,Well-made,"These folders seem reasonably sturdy and look like they'll hold up. Our file folders are used for years, sometimes decades, and other brands have fallen apart when the adhesive under the fold breaks down. Won't know for years if these will pass that test, but they seem solid enough. My only complaint, very minor, is that the tabs have pointed-corner edges, which might get ragged with multiple handlings. I've always prfereed rounded-corner tab edges."
5,Excellent patient folders,The quality of these folders is much nicer than those available for purchase locally. Service was great as usual and all was delivered on time. I highly recommend these Smead folders.
3,a little flimsy,The colors are great and the fasteners are fine.... but the actual folder is a little on the thin side and is a bit flimsy. I needed to alter what I was going to use them for because they do not appear to stand up well to a lot of use.
3,not very sturdy,"For a pack of fifty it seems to be a good value overall. However, the folders are very thin and will not stand up to muchheavy use or being overfilled. Also, you will need to buy a two hole punch to get any use out of these folders. I ended updonating them to my daughter's school in the hope they could better utilize them."
4,Another great tool for keeping oneself organized,"I have the goal of getting all papers and receipts organized before the new year. It's so frustrating to need some document and having to browse piles of papers before finding it, hence I finally took the time to place everything where it belongs. These folders having two fasteners per folder allow to organize a couple of different issues within each folder. For example, there are great to keep children's school and doctor appointment related papers. The different colors can be used to track individual family members documents as well. I highly recommend it."
3,Better,"This is MUCH improved from her first video. The music is not annoying, she's got good people demonstrating proper positioning, and I really like how she narrates instead of talking while doing the routine. I think more videos should do that! I love her opening prayer and how the moves really put me in a spirit of praising God.This routine just seems too easy, like for senior citizens. It's nice to do on a rest day to keep myself limber and for meditating on the wonder of God.I will look for her new power version looking for something more challenging for the muscles. Keep it up Laurette! We all learn from trial and error."
2,Christian Alternative to Yoga for Beginners,This is a great video for Christians who want to do yoga without all the new age mumbo-jumbo. This workout is more suited for beginners. I've done Yoga for almost two years so I was disappointed that I didn't work up a sweat and I need a more advanced workout.
2,Praise Moves,"Nice concept but I was very disappointed with the quality and execution of the concept. The film quality was very unpleasant to watch, I expected soft colors and relaxing tones but it was like a dated aerobics exercise video with harsh colors and sounds. It needed to flow more gently and with a little more class. The instructor was too ""PollyAnna-ish"". I loved the fact that the stretches were correlated with scripture but the execution was childish and simple. The camera work was low budget and irritating. I don't mean to be harsh but I think the principle is great and would love a high quality well executed DVD to enjoy. This was not enjoyable and kinda cheesy."
5,very challenging!,I ordered this DVD because I am pregnant and wanted some stretching excercises to d help with labor. This DVD is challenging-she does have a person who gives you an alternative if your not that limber(like me). When I looked at the excercises in my pregnancy book they were similar to some of the ones I am doing on the video so I am going to stick with it. Great video-not for the faint at heart!
3,good video,"I enjoy the workout, but it's not as vigerous as the yoga video I was trying to replace. Would have liked a better flow to the workout."
5,great book for kids,"Used to read this to my daughter when she was about 4. She really liked the story, I loved the illustrations. Have now passed this book (and it's ""partner"" Storm is Coming) on to a friend for her boys. Just great books."
4,Farting Fred Book,"I purchased it for a friend of mine to give to her niece. I have not heard if the niece liked or not, but I figure if I don't hear anything then they must like it well enough."
4,I really LOVE the fuzzy part,"The story is decent enough, but what I really like is the furry part. You see, the front of the book is the dog and he has real hair. I don't know if its carpet or sheep hair, but it's hairy and soft. I like to rub my face on it. It's nice.Great book."
5,Still made in Britain,"I added these bowls to my existing set. The are a perfect match and are still made in England, as the rest of my Portmeirion dishware. This is important to me. They are a excellent sized small bowl."
2,Mismatch so item was returned.,"I have similar 6 inch Oatmeal and Soup bowls and since the bowls I purchased are somewhat different from the one I already have I returned my purchase, a rarity for me. I don't care for the trouble of returns in anything I buy anywhere.I do hope that I can find the bowls that match my set. Up to the present I have had no difficulty adding the various Portmeirion dishes to my set. And it is so convenient to buy them at Amazon and at a good discount.I am also looking for the larger soup bowls and will purchase more of the pasta bowls which I love."
2,VW Restoration Manual,"Too be brief, I am very disapointed in both the quality and quantity of restoration information in this manual for a bus. I see now why the word ""Transporter"" is in smaller print....there is way too little information on the bus and therefore, not alot of value.If I knew then what I know now, I would not have bought the book. My bad!! I definitely would NOT recommend the manual to anyone wanting help and guidance on restoring a bus....sorry."
3,V What,The book is pretty good. I was trying to get a color of original but all they give is name not the actual color.
3,VW Beetle & Transporter: Restoration Manual,The VW Beetle & Transporter: Restoration Manual wasn't for ME.
5,THE book to have in your library if you're seriuos about vw!,"You begin with a foreward by Ivan Hirst himself. The man responsible from the British military for breathing life back in to the recently war torn vw plant in 1945. This is the definitive book on restoring your vw beetle and transporter. The resto focuses mainly on the beetle and only touching the real problem areas on the vw transporter (van). With this book, and some skill with the welder, you can rid your vw of painful rust and wear. You'll get a history lesson as well as a religous lesson on getting intimate with the structure and mechanics of your beloved vw. If you think you won't need this one, you're passing up an opportunity."
4,Saving the Beetle,"A very well written book, as usual for Haynes, that is a good beginner's start for restoring vintage VW's. I would wish for a more detailed, hands-on techniques for welding as most restos require extensive body part replacement. Especially in the US Rustbelt where my cars came from."
3,OK book,"This book was highly recommended on this site and many VW sites. I did not find this book nearly as useful as people claimed. If you had little experience working on cars I guess it would be more useful, but it is very basic."
4,Great source of information.,"Excellent source of information. I would have liked a little more detail on some items such as floorpan replacement, but as a whole this is a must have book for the Beetle/Transporter owner."
5,if you own a 63 - 67 bus this manual is for you,own a bus? you will be working on it... or SOMEONE will. great book. well written and easy to find what you want. It's a keeper.
5,Rare blues outing from Lizst and Musorgsky,"Few people are aware today of the great blues recordings of Franz Liszt and Musorgsky, since their classical/romantic efforts tend to overshadow these lesser-known catalogs. That's a shame, for as this collection shows, Lizst could play a mean slide electric guitar and Musorgsky could blow the blues harmonica with the best of them. This CD includes Musorgsky's classic nationalistic blues effort, ""(I Seen Her) Picture at an Exhibition"", and Lizst's screamer, ""Hungarian Blues"", which influenced many later bluesmasters such as Robert Plant and Eric Clapton."
5,worth the money,My parents got this for me for my 13th birthday. It is great! The only 2 complaints is that u cant charge it over night becasue if you do it will reduce service life. And that 4-5 hours of charge delivers 3 hours of use. But those are my only complaints and i think it was definately worth the money.
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"I bought this item to use for traveling entertainment. I've found that it does not play all discs, and sometimes it will freeze up in the middle of a movie for no apparent reason. It also makes a really loud sound while loading a movie. I suppose it will serve its purpose for awhile, but I imagine that there are better products out there."
1,Zipper doesn't work - This is cheap & disappointing,"The zipper doesn't stay closed below the thing you pull to open and close it. I bought it at a store with a 60-day return policy. This problem began about 70 days after buying it. Eddie Bauer doesn't stand behind their products as they claim.If you want a sleeping bag for 60-days, this one's nice and soft. But if you want one for a few years or so, buy something else!"
1,not recommended,"This hymnal contains new and unfamiliar arrangements of many songs as Amazing Grace, Just As I Am, and Jesus Loves Me. Most members of a congregation cannot sing these arrangements so that the the voices of those singing parts they have memorized clash with those who do sing the arrangements as written."
3,"Nice, but...","The indexes are helpful and there are a wide range of songs, but many of the old familiar tunes have been re-arranged. This was an unforgivable act, and it makes old favorites difficult to sing when some try to follow the arrangement and others try to sing the way the song was supposed to be sung."
5,Truly the Best of the Temptations--Outstanding,"If you've ever looked at a multi-disc set and said ""I could have put all of MY favorite tracks on one disc""---This is the disc! Excellent job of mixing great music and making it sound even better!"
2,Poor,"I'm only a passing fan of The Temps, but wanted at least a ""Greatest Hits"" CD in my collection so they would have some representation.While (most) of the songs I know and like are on the disc, the sound quality is abysmal... unless you want to hear it like it was on that mono transister radio you had back in 1971. As far as I can tell, there was no remastering done whatsoever. A disappointment."
5,Great album of classic group,"This album contains classic songs by the Temptations. My personal favorites are ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg,"" which I sang as a sophmore in college with a friend and that experience inspired me to get this album. I also like ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" and also ""Get Ready,"" which I never knew the Temptations did until I bought this album. This is a great album and contains most of the songs you would want unless you are into unreleased songs and alternate takes on songs by the Temptations."
2,Some Skipping,"When I received this CD, I played it immediately. However, some songs were skipping and I had to advance the CD.I was disappointed and I don't think I will buy another CD from Amazon."
2,Something Missing.,"Ultimate Collection? Where is ""Beauty Is Only Skin Deep""? Their best tune and it is left off. How about cutting out the last 4 tracks as well."
2,"Been there, done that","Recycled and repackaged, the hits of the classic Tempts keep getting ""carted"" out to squeeze a few more pennies out of the public. For the casual listener or first time buyer of a Temptation tape or CD, I guess this package does the job. For most of us, who've listened to the Tempts for many years, ""Ultimate Collection"" is like, AGAIN? Rickey Wright knows the answer to his own question: Why stick ""Errors of Our Ways"" on such a collection? You'll note it's the ONLY song from the 90's on Ultimate Collection! The same tunes are re-released in 1999 and now are called, ""The Millenium Collection"". A virtual waste of money"
4,Ask a REAL Temptations fan...,"Not really the ""Best"". Although all the songs here are mostly ""great"" the ommisions make this not a buy. I agree, ""Beauty is only skin deep"" should absolutely be included. What about ""Masterpiece""? Maybe they should call this ""Temptations - some good and great singles"". Wheres ""Psychedelic Shack""? Its not that theres bad music here, its just not the ""Ultimate""."
1,NEVER RECIEVED IT!!! SENT WRONG ONE,"picture of doll is perfect. to bad this company sends whatever it wants, which is crap. doll was not even close to it."
1,Wrong item,"The wrong item is pictured, very misleading to the customer. Although Amazon has been told repeatedly about the mistake it has not been corrected. The item received looks nothing like the picture."
1,wrong picture STILL,"This still has the wrong picture- the item I received has straight walls and no handles as the previous reviewer mentioned, I was hoping they had corrected that error in the past year. The piece I received is geometric and boring without all the character of the rounded piece in the photo. I would NEVER BUY THIS ITEM while the quality is good it is still not the item pictured in the item description."
1,skip it,"new zealand is an embarassment. there are only a FEW good rappers out there today like Scribe, P-Money, Deceptikonz and King Kapisi. i don't know what possessed nesian mystik to make such a stink song, new zealand music is not even worth listening to."
1,Inside The Tuscan Hills The Chianti and Central Tuscany,Very poor quality DVD. Lots of stopping and starting of DVD.Subject matter marginal.
3,Fun Story,"This book is a fun and light read. It's an interesting take on the rogue class, though I was a bit disappointed in the high morality shown by the main character. It seemed a little unbelievable considering her poverty and growing up on the streets, which was demonstrated very well by the author. The climax of the book was titantic and well worth the read."
2,Boring,"This book was very boring to me. There was never a exciting part![ well, i stoped reading it before i got to the end] i don't thik this ones very good, in my opinion. I say that i like the Kit mystery, Danger in the theater, i think its called. I give this a two star,because i don't know how it ended and it might be good. Hope i helped!!!!!"
3,Danger At The Zoo,"There was a girl who needed a job, so she applied to work at the zoo. She got the job a few days later. After she was working for a few days all of the workers food was gone or the food was missing. ( apples, bananas, crackers, ext...) So then all of the workers and the person who owns the zoo where keeping a eye out, but then they thought that someone broke in. Then they figured out that no broke in because there was no evidence. So then a few days later, at night, a few people stayed and found out that there where two homeless people that where living there because they didn't have no money. ( poor ) So now all of the people that work there are all happy!"
3,Post It Highlighter,"Flag Pen, Black Medium Ballpoint Pen, 150 3/8"" Red FlagsThe product was fine. I had/have a dispute with the shipping. I asked for consolidated shipping, all items sent together. The items were shipped individually and shipping charged was more than the item...this is unacceptable and ridiculous. I tried to get it resolved via Customer Service which was also unsatisfactory."
5,REALITY,"This book is the first recovery book for SRA survivors that I have read. The effects of my own abuse and experience with SRA and DID(formerly multiple personality disorder) were capsulized in this single book. No book can ""do justice"" to the severity and prevalence of SRA, yet I am greatly impressed with the depth of knowledge and wisdom Daniel Ryder portrayed in this book. Incorporating the 12 Steps into SRA recovery was a lifesaver to me, and I wish I could thank Daniel personally."
3,A helpful introduction to ritual abuse,"This book will be helpful to therapists and support friends of ritual abuse survivors. While Breaking The Cycle takes a 12 step approach to recovery (similiar To Alcoholics Anonymous), Daniel Ryder presents a more secular approach on healing. While traditional therapy and peer counseling may be extremely helpful, a more spiritual approach will often produce remarkable results.Therapists and support people may benefit greatly from Daniel Ryder's research and sensitivity toward survivors. There's a great deal of documentation and heroic stories of recovery by several survivors. Some of the material is out of date and survivors now have greater resources via the internet.Overall, I'd recommend Breaking The Cycle as a supplement to traditional therapy. I'd caution survivors while reading due to the highly triggering material. For further reading I'd suggest: A Safe Passage to Healing by Chrystine Oksana."
1,false accusations poor writing,"This book is proof only of poor writing, and seeks to prey on the innocent by suggesting almost every bad experience in you life can be translated back to sexual or satanic abuse. This amateur needs to do better research before attempting to influence people who truly need help."
1,Hilariously Funny,"A perfect book for reading on the toilet or in the bathtub. You can pick it up, start anywhere in the middle, and stop anywhere without having to bother with marking your place. Genuine delightfully mindless drivel."
2,"Nothing special, but well done !","I just bought this movie because Constance McCashin (Laura from Knots Landing) is playing in it. The story is known from lots of other movies. A woman is mad for her favorite soap star and hunts and tries to kill him. Nothing special about this ""made for TV"" film. But if you like the stars in this movie, it's worth watching it."
4,"Gentlemanly, intelligent, very British, and a wonderful title","When it comes to a substantial inheritance, aren't there always too many cousins? When assistant Public Prosecutor Harvey Tuke becomes aware that three of six cousins have died ""accidental"" deaths, he becomes involved in the lives of the remaining three. The characters are likable,for the most part, the situation complex [you'll wish you had a map] and the ending a surprise. Dover reprinted this for a reason."
5,This book is wonderful!!!,"I have just over the past year or so picked up Teresa Medeiros books, but, after this one, she is my new favorite! It was so funny at parts and at other times it was so heart wrenching! She certainly has a way with words. I truly hope that Carey gets his own book soon! He was such an excellent secondary character! I love Austyn! While a bit suspicious, he is such a great hero! Alot of people were so bent about the whole him locking Holly in the tower thing. This sort of thing more than likely did happen back in the day as Welsh people are known to be superstitious. It just didnt bother me all that much. Anyhow, this book is just so great!!! Holly was a great heroine! I loved how she wasnt afraid of Austyn one bit! I felt so many emotions reading this book, and that is what I look for! The whole first half of the book I was laughing out loud!!! To anyone who is thinking about a good book, this is one of the best that I have read in a long time!"
2,Not one of her best,The story of Holly and Sir Austyn of Gavenmore starts off great. I found the beg. humorous and exciting. The whole time she was ugly the book was great. Yet she tarnishes herself so much its strange. Austyn who is a great guy turns evil. He bares her basically in her birthday suit in front of everyone. He also just treats her like (...)!! I really felt sorry for Holly she didn't deserve him and he shouldn't have ever gotten her. I feel that if you like a dumb hero read this one because the guys a fool and the girl isn't that much better for gettin with him.
3,"Curses, curses, curses","For both Holly and Austyn beauty is a curse. That's the basic premise of this ""marriage comes first, revelations come second and love comes later"" romance. I'm sure it's hard to come up with original ideas in a genre with so many existing plots. Still, this one stretched my ability to suspend disbelief. Her family would let her get married looking like a hag rather than risk disgrace? Austyn, a pretty smart guy, couldn't tell she was costumed? Yea, right....I read this because it was the winner of Romantic Time's Reviewer Choice Award in the Love and Laughter category in 1995. It's my first Mederios novel. Overall, it was a pleasant enough read but nothing exceptional. Nothing made me laugh out loud but there were a few scenes that brought a smile to my face."
2,mmmmm--not bad,"When I first reviewed this book, I was excited that I was in for a great rolicking good read. But fate would have it that albeit it was somewhat amusing to read, twas not great. I get a little tired of spoiled beauties that wrap the most intelligent to the most lack witted around their little fingers. And although she went to lengths to be a hag, it dident ring quite true that this stud muffin would want her in anyway but a chum! If even that, considering the beliefs back then made them shun uglies as possible evils. Was a Saturday afternoon read, when you have absolutely nothing else to do or inbetween the loads of laundry."
1,I couldn't finish the book. I threw it away!,"I struggled half-way through but I couldn't carry on . It was so boring, padded and long-winded. I just threw it away.I groan when I think of the several books by this writer that I bought together with this book."
1,plain dumb and retarded,"I'm surprised i saw this book being rated as 5 stars. If possible i would give it a negative 5, i'm surpised it was even published in the first place. Obviously the author has nothing to talk about, this story is based on two dumb idiots who hate eachother because they discovered the other was good looking, i just don't get it. Its like an adult version of the frog prince. Believe me those who think this is good work, theres better ones out there where their conflicts are about more important matters than just beauty. The title says it all for this book, from beginning to the end thats all you'll get, two vain characters who hates eachother because the other ones better looking. They definitely deserve eachother. Poor work, poor story, if there wasn't any graphic sex scences, it'll definitely be a mothergoose tale."
3,Not my favorite,This is not my favorite Medeiros. There was just something missing. Not her best. I didn't like the hero nor the herroine. Even for a fairy tale I just couldn't believe in it. The characters were just not full believable people. There is nothing really wrong with this book it is just that so many other Teresa Medeiros books are wonderful that this one pales in comparison. Read The bride and the beast or Charming the Prince. They are great!
5,Excellent gist.,"I really, really liked this book. Made me laugh ... and regret I had finished it .... it is worth every penny."
3,Nothing like a pen. Besides a pencil..,"Pens galore! Draw with them, chew on them, stick 'em in your ear, whatever you wish. The possibilities are endless with pens!Only 12, though, and for the price, it's not worth it. You may as well just steal from your co-workers.."
2,Like every other...,This is a very basic pen. I was looking for something that wrote a bit smoother but it's a great cheap pen.
5,Great for cement block,"This is a great nailer. We have used it to attach furring to cement block as well as framing out windows to cement block. This is old cement block, so we were concerned about the nail not holding, but it does a very good job. Part of this is due to the fact of the nails used. I would highly recommend this nailer."
3,"Please for the love of god, review all the matches","The Iron Man Match for the WWF Championship was the best match in WWF history. ""The Hitman"" Bret Hart and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" Shawn Michaels went to the time limit without a single decision. Gorilla Monsoon (R.I.P.) should get a lot of credit. He restarted the match after neither superstar had scored a pinfall. He was right to do so. This decision turned out to make the match the longest match in WM history.Goldust vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper was another great match because Piper had a huge rivalry with Goldust at the time.Million Dollar Champion Steve Austin vs. Savio Vega was somewhat entertaining. Austin wins thanks to Ted DiBiase.Ultimate Warrior vs. The Gentlemen Hunter Hearst Helmsley was one the worst matches on the card. Should have been on RAW.Undertaker vs. Diesel was an outstanding match that showed how tough Diesel and Undertaker were.All in all, the Undertaker-Diesel match and the IronMan match saved this PPV from getting 1 star."
4,The Iorn Man Match,Wrestlemain 12 was an all-round impresive show. But with out a dout the match which caught every bodys attention was the iorn man match in which Bret Hart and Shawn Micheals wrestled each other for over 65 mins this was a truley unbeliveable match as both wrestlers took each other to there limts. The rest of the card offerd your standard wrestlemaina action but it is still one of the best matchs that you will ever see in the WWF.
4,Fun for Discussion Group,"A great read for a book club discussion! Our club read it and had a wonderful discussion. Extremely interesting, thought-provoking, funny, and very surprising. Leaves me smiling every time I think about the characters."
3,BLAH!,"I find books about aliens and people in small towns pretty interesting. This story was not that good though. The main character is supposed to be a sweet, innocent, small town girl who you just never fall in love with. Her character isn't developed in a realistic way. As a matter of fact most of the town folks aren't real. This wouldn't be such a problem had the novel not been rounded enough to even keep you interested. The only reason I finished the book was to find out if there were really aliens or not. The alien story line was the only part of the novel that kept me interested. A disappointing read."
2,I like Black Metal as much as the next guy but...,"I'm just not into this band. When I want to get my Black Metal fix I go for bands such Agathodaimon, Graveworm, and Ram-Zet. I'm not saying you shoudl not get this. But it's just not my kind of Black Metal that's so don't take this for anything other then it is."
2,Popeye the Sailor Man on Vocals...,"I have been into metal (mainly death metal) for years but I've recently started to expand my horizons and dabble into other genres as well. Reknowned for being among Black Metal's elite, I had to check out Dimmu Borgir. I must admit, I am very impressed with their musicianship, but no matter how good the music, I can't hold back the chuckles when I hear their ""vocalist"". The first thought that came to mind was Popeye. Sounds like the same voice that sings the ""I Am what I Am..."" song from the cartoon. Spooky music, evil lyrics, but the vocals are just downright comical."
3,First Impression...Not so good,"I first picked up this cd when somebody compared them to Cradle of Filth. First off they are nothing like Cradle of Filth. Shagrath has the typical not-too-exciting black metal singer voice, a low monotonous growl. They basically sounds like most Black Metal bands like Immortal. Of course most of their songs sound the same, but that is not a bad thing. But the track Progenies is really good, and i listen to the first 30 seconds over and over again for some reason(maybe i am crazy). Overall if you liked this cd i would suggest Immortal ""Sons of Northern Darkness"" or Mayehm ""Chimera""."
5,Beautiful Blackmetal,"This seems to be one of Dimmu Borgir's most aggressive attempts, and I really think they produced something great. I especially liked ""Allehelgens Dod I Helveds Rike"" with the Norwegian lyrics and its surreal singing. I sometimes wonder if I'm the only one who thinks this kind of music can be beautiful, or if I'm the only one that falls asleep listening to it. I love many kinds of metal (along with other varieties of music) and this is one of my favorite albums. The orchestra adds volume to the Dimmu sound and seems to blend quite well. Worth the money for any loyal Dimmu Borgir fan."
5,a few shades darker,"well. those wacky norwegians just keep coming up with the stuff.dimmu borgir managed to avoid a cut and paste copy of their last wicked record and came up with something perhaps a little slower (which is still pretty fast) but up a few notches in the creepy section. thank god the keyboards finally get to make keyboard sounds and ALL of the symphonic business is taken care of by a full blown symphony. by reigining in the speed a little, dimmu borgir put the fast parts into a new context which successfully makes the seem faster and more psychotic. the riffs are a little more defined. the drums approach an alien quality. the cover artwork underneath the insert (what you see on the internet) is actually beautifully rendered and sets the tone for this album of demonic splendor. a fun record from start to finish."
5,Old Schooler's Review,"Put it this way. If you enjoyed Celtic Frost's ""To Mega Therion"" you will like this CD. A few listens and it draws you in to find more and more riffs you can't help but listen to again. The orchestra is nothing new in black metal so get over it and pick up dimmu borgir's best."
1,The Masters of 'Mainstream Black Metal',"Any black metal that is deemed mainstream you can pretty much guarantee is terrible, this music, along with cradle of filth of course, is music for the mall goths. And nothing more. If you are mainstream black metal you automatically cannot make a cd with attitude, i'm sorry but your not gonna make a cd that people take seriously in a studio. Take darkthrone for example, or small projects like northwood ice pentagrams or abruptum, they dont want good production because it takes away from the experience and the raw feelings within the music. I myself am in a black metal band, and it's disgusting how people think we 'must sound like COF' or some crap like that. Dimmu Borgir should sit down, there's no such thing as mainstream BM."
1,Terrible,I once dropped my guitar down the stairs and it sounded very much like this album. Not alot of musical talent. Their style is old and has been done by countless other bands that sound much better. Let Alice wear the make-up. Drop the Satanic act. It's so 80's.
1,Worst CD ever,"I think everyone has lost their minds completely. The new Dimmu album (excluding the first 2 tracks, they are good) might just be the worst music I have ever heard. I am a devoted Dimmu fan and not just some dumbass nu-metal kid either. This album is crap. The melodies are unmemorable, boring, and not original at all. Two minutes into every song I just wanted the song to be over so I could put the CD back in its case and forget I ever bought it. Also, tracks 8-11 might as well be one 25 minute song. They sound exactly the same. I don't know what people see in this album. Just because Dimmu made it doesn't make it great. I expect much more from their next release. Shame on you Dimmu for releasing this 63 minute nightmare. For good music by Dimmu check out any of their CD's except this one."
1,Satanic Garbage,"Save your money and don't waste it on this satanic sacrificial swank. This isn't even metal to me. This is a bunch of witches performing witchcraft through a metal sound just to suck people into their foolish and disgusting cult. After having a brother kill himself due to beiing so obsessed with the early satanic thrash act Slayer, I realized how lyrics and the music can get people so obsessed and change for the worst. If you are a first timer and are considering buying this album or any from these satanic bands, be aware of the content please. It's a pitty that they even allow filth like this to be put on the shelves."
3,"Good, but....",They are not the bodoms or in flames' league right now....but this is brutal and very hypnotic....just not as many grinding riffs or hooks as the other two...
3,"OK, let's be honest....","Doesn't anyone else listening to pretty much anything in the ""Black Metal"" genre admit that while some of the music is definitely worth listening to (DB being one of them), that most of the vocals, and virtually ALL of the lyrics are ridiculous? Maybe I felt the same way about Slayer when I first heard them back in 1983, but grew to love them over time. Somehow the Black Metal guys just seem to take everything far too seriously to be TAKEN seriously.Maybe I'm alone on this one, but that would be a shame..."
3,what a mess,"Like a dumb A$$ i went and bought this album after hearing progenies of the great apoc. I like this band simply because the song blended A. an orchestra B. black metal guitar riffs C. Awesome clean vocal breakdowns. I'm sad to say that Prog's is the only damn song with this style of vocals from ""vortex"" the bassist. the rest of the cd is a freaking mess of madness that seems to just drone on and on. if it had more BM/hardcore guitar riffs and breakdowns, more of the clean vocals, and a hell of alot less of shag's inane satanic blatherings I would have been much happier with the CD."
5,Phenominal,"This CD is just phenominal. I can't get enough of it. Everything from the guitar riffs, unique lyrics, and even the inclusion of the Gothenburg Orchestra makes this cd phenominal. By far the best CD yet from Dimmu Borgir. Get it now!"
5,Butchered At Birth,"Fisrt of all, Dimmu in no way, has disapointed me. Thier sound is by far one of the most creative i have ever heard.Heavy and Dark Growls, Operatic vocals, ear shattering drums,awesome guitars, are the key ingredients that makes these guys whom they are.It wasn't as hard and as fast as puritanical euphoric misanthropia however it was almost just as good. There is really no band to compare these guys to because they have a completly different style."
1,Dimmu what??,"OK, sorry for all you people who love Dimmu, but this is music??The lead ""singer"" isn't even singing, he's screaming his head off! I swear the dude's going to bust a vein anytime soon.Drums? All you hear are the bass drums. That's it. Duhduhduhduhduhduhduh....... That's it.Lyrics? They absolutely suck. All they want to do is shock you, and there's absolutely NO MEANING to their lyrics. Just shock crap. If you're going to write a song, write a song that someone can SING TO, not SCREAM AT.Oh this isn't the only one that sucks royally, NIN, TOOL, Iron Maiden, etc also suck. This isn't music people, this is an embarrassment to what true musical art really is."
4,Great work,"Death Cult Armageddon is a well created work of musical art. The replacement of the synthesized sounds with a real orchestra adds a certain element to the music that I really enjoyed. While I liked PEM their previous album it got boring at some points, it wasn't something i could listen to for hours on end. Death Cult changes that. It's well composed, and you can tell they put thought into the writings of the songs. In my opinion this is Dimmu's best album since For All Tid and Stormblast. Thumbs up."
4,"the begining of dimmu's downfall, or the begining of a era?","This album though very good is not near as dark or heavy as 'puritanical...'. It is a much more thrashy styled album, The production is simply put 'too good' and actaully gets on my nerves. And as for Nick Barker (ghrrrrr) this is simply not drumming a human can acomplish, and he cirtainly didnt do very well live at there show. I now realize that dimmu will never do as good as enthrone darkness triumphant. Now dimmu is on the main stage at ozzfest 04', I could take the easy route and call them 'sell outs' but i wont simply cause i know if my band were offered to play on one of the biggest festivals, we would of course take the offer, so i cant blame them. Overall this is a quility album, but has lost alot of the emotional feeling of puritanical.."
3,"Great Show, Bad Audio","I bought this item Brand New from Amazon.com to continue my series collection. No doubt, I've been a fan of Charmed since it originally aired on TV. However, as with a couple of discs from new sets of earlier seasons, the audio does cut out on some episodes. This gets very annoying as I watch and I end up putting on subtitles. Audio cut outs can last anywhere between 30 seconds-5 mins. I'm thinking this must be a manufacturing defect and nothing that can be fixed otherwise."
5,super series,"I bought this as part of a set of the whole series for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas last year. I watched the first season with her and found it appropriate for her age, as well as deeming it acceptable for my 10 year old son as well. He loves it, also! I would love to see more great fantasy programs like this offered to kids and teens. Where have the good ol' days of television gone? I would reccommend this for girls (though brothers will likely enjoy, too) ages 10 to adult even."
1,boring,Charmed season 4 is boring. After Prue die theshow isnt good at all. I dont like paige at all. Season 4-8 isnt good to me
1,Charmed,Charmed the 4th season is not good. I also dont like paigeat all. I stop watching charmed Afterseason 3 is over. Charmed isnt my favorite show anymore.I rather watch barney on PBS then charmed 4-8.
1,stupid show now,Charmed is a stupid show now since Prue die. I stopped watching Charmed since Prue is dead. The last season I watch was season 3. Paige isnt that good to me when i watched season premeire and then I stoped.
5,love,It is a great season because the charmed ones are reconstitutedIt had wear on the box but not bad and got here very slowRecommend to all
1,Missing an episode???,Is it me or is there an very important episode missing between the end of Season 3 and the beginning of Season 4. They totally left out the episode where Prue dies. They advertised this as the COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON with 22 episodes. Not until I bought it and opened it did I realize that it is missing that episode and only includes 21 of the 22 episodes from Season 4. How can they get away with this? I am a disappointed fan and I am calling for an explanation from Paramount!
1,Missing the most important episode!,"Season 3 ended with two sisters (Prue and Piper) wounded by a demon and Phoebe stuck in the underworld being held by the Source. I expected Season 4 to begin with the continuation of that episode. I just started to watch Charmed during Season 5 so I never did know what happened to Prue. I was expecting to see the episode where Prue dies at the beginning of Season 4. What happened to it? I know it exists because I have seen bits and pieces of it on reruns. Was it cut out of the Season 4 DVD so they didn't have to pay royalties to Shannon Doherty? I am VERY disappointed as that is a major event to be missing. Now there is no transition from the Season 3 to the Season 4 DVD. (THEY ARE BOTH ADVERTISED AS THE ""COMPLETE"" SEASON""...BUT THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.) I do NOT recommend the Season 4 DVD for this reason alone."
5,BEST ONE LET,"This one is the best one let! We meet Page, piper became a Fury over Prue death, phoebe got a new jod and the Source of all evil tryed to kill them all. It not my favorte season but it stll very grate. Of course I had to take a star off because there still no special F..."
1,boring,After Shannen D. left the show went down. I hate season 4-8 and I will never ever buy this season.
3,An OK season that could have been the best,"I am a fan of the show since it started. I love shannen and I was sad that she left, but my review has nothing to do with her or her character. I was more than upset with the writers that here they had a fresh character yet they decide to go extend PHOEBE's story instead of concentrating on the new girl PAIGE. I was disappointed that they don't even respect the fans of the show enough to give PRUE a proper closure. I hated the fact that instead of Holly's name appearing first got put all the way to the end and Alyssa's first. Alyssa is an OK actress, but the show doesn't revolve around her and her character (the weekest one of the three). Unfortunetely the show went down hill after Doherty'e departure (sea. 4-7). I love the new season. I love PAYGE PHOEBE & PIPER story lines and I love the fact that they no longer concentrate in either one of the sister but in all of them."
4,Charmed Again,"I'm new to Charmed, and have yet to watch the remaining seasons. But from what I have seen, it's a completely different show. After the loss of their sister Prue, half-sister Paige comes into play. She takes a bit of getting used to, but she shows her worth and true character within a about 5 episodes. I was a huge fan of Prue, so this change was a bit difficult. The sisters no longer have that bond that was shown through seasons 1-3. More of an obligation of love just from being related. There also seems to be a bit of a role switch. Piper has definitely taken on a fierce roll after Prue's death. And Paige is similar to the Phoebe in previous seasons. This season is packed with action, drama and a lot of fun. Watching Paige's power grow was great. I wasn't quite sure if I'd continue to watch Charmed/buy the seasons. But this season still managed to have me hooked. Definitely recommended. Just watch out for a different show than the first three seasons."
3,What's With The Holdup Of The Fourth Season DVD Boxset?,"Charmed is one of my favorite shows and the fourth season is one of my favorite seasons and I was so glad when I found out that it would be coming out on DVD on February 28, but I am greatly disapointed to hear that there is now a delay and it's currently not available. What happened? Were the DVD's not ready yet? Were they defective and had to be recalled? Will it ever be available to buy?"
3,What's With The Holdup Of The Fourth Seaon DVD Boxset?,"Charmed is one of my favorite shows and the fourth season is one of my favorite seasons and I was so glad when I found out that it would be coming out on DVD on February 28, but I am greatly disapointed to hear that there is now a delay and it's currently not available. What happened? Were the DVD's not ready yet? Were they defective and had to be recalled? Will it ever be available to buy?"
1,very upset with product,"One of the six discs (four episodes)will not play. When inserted into dvd screen reads ""no playback feature."" As I have opened and played some of the other discs I am unable to return the item but I will certainly remember this when shopping for dvds in the future."
5,"Adios Prue, Hello Paige","Although Prue lended her ""talents"" to Charmed, the introduction of Paige brougt a whole new meaning to the fact that Shannon did not control the show. Piper ""Holly Marie"" is the strongest actress on this show. If she remains, then there'll will always be Charmed. Goodby Prue and welcome Paige. I commend the creators of this series and thank you for it."
5,Nice magazine,"I'm a licensed, graduate-degreed horticulturist and landscaper and find nice nuggets and ideas in this magazine. Seems like this would be good for persons with all levels of experience and background."
2,Where's the digital version!?,"Good mag but as far as I can tell, u have to pay extra for the digital or ipad version which is lame cause other mags such as cooking light come w the digital version w ur subscription which I have not figured out yet w organic gardening. Add the digital/ ipad version w ur regular subscription and this would be great!"
2,False advertisement,"I have subscribed to Organic Gardening magazine few months ago. They had a promotion, but the Encyclopedia of Flowers or some similar book for $15. I haven't received the book at all, the magazine took very long too. Articles are not what I expect. I was hoping for more seasonal tips and education. Beautiful execution but not much content."
3,dont know if I'll renew,"organic is great but do I have time to stay truely organanic??? Its difficult, I have acres of garden and no help."
5,great,Gift for my Father and he is really enjoying it! hate have to write a minimum amount of words for reviews think I will stop giving reviews in the future as I am way to busy for this
2,I thought this was gardening?!? If your looking for gardening keep looking!,"You'd think a magazine whose name is 'Organic Gardening' Would have more on gardening, sure I've seen a couple articles on pests (one an issue) but not much on Gardening most of the issues I've gotten are filled with recipes! I was really hoping to find a good gardening magazine, guess I'll have to keep looking..."
1,Not much information,i won't subscribe to this magazine again. It was short on info and the info that was there was not all that interesting or helpful.
4,I like it!,Lots of great ideas and tips. I am a new gardener and I have a lot to learn so I got the subscription in hopes of expanding my knowledge.
2,A Mere Shadow of Its Former Self,"I subscribed to Organic Gardening decades ago when the magazine was digest size, printed on non-glossy paper, and jam packed with in-depth, substantive articles that took hours to read and even longer to think about. Now I can read the entire magazine in a brief sitting, and rarely find much to mull over afterward. It's departed from its origins as an intelligent publication focusing on the precepts and practicalities of growing organically, in favor of pandering to the attention-challenged reader who can't--or won't--concentrate on anything beyond quick bytes and pretty pictures. In short, it's abandoned a grown up approach for that of a little child's picture book without much content. I may or may not renew my subscription when it expires in another year. The few interesting bits that crop up--surprisingly--from time to time may keep me engaged. We'll see what the next year brings."
1,poor customer service,"Love the magazine but the customer service is not to my liking. Rightat this moment the ""contact customer service"" feature is not workingonline. I cannot send them an email.They have made a mistake with my bill and I want to talk to someone. There is no number available to talk to a real person.I did contact customer service earlier and gotback what seemed to be some pre-programmed answer that did not helpme and that I was not able to forward a response to. They also havean automatic renew feature that you have to be careful about. I wasable to cancel this feature with no problem.Love the magazine. Poorrating because of customer service(it's just a magazine!). I can goto the library. I have 2 subscriptions and I will not renew."
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I remember reading this as a kid when it was smaller in size, came every month and was absolutely packed with pages on everything. It was fun to read all the ads and it took a real long time to read alll the articles. It's full size now, comes every two months. Although the main article in my first issue was timely (poppies), I just wasn't impressed with the mag."
4,A Fast-Paced Exciting Story,"Those familiar with Cameron Judd's work will not be surprised by the well developed characters and intricate plot twists. For anyone who is not acquainted with the author, Corrigan will serve as a good introduction. The book is short (roughly 180 pages) and it's populated by three-dimensional individuals. With the right mixture of suspense, romance, tragedy, and inspiration, Corrigan leaves you with a good feeling. Anyone who is leery about picking up an unfamiliar author for fear of encountering gratuitous sex, violence, or profanity, can rest assured Corrigan--like all of Judd's books that I have read so far--proves that it is very possible to tell an adult story without any of the above.I would also like to add that I am not your typical western fan. With the exception of Cameron Judd's book, I have probably only read three or four westerns."
3,beautiful photographs,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. I FELT I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED ABOUT PAINTING A VARIETY OF LANDSCAPES AND I DIDN'T REALLY. HOWEVER, IT IS QUITE A NICE BOOK OF MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORED PHOTOGRAPHS."
5,Great book on landscape painting.,"""Painting the Changing. Seasons in Pastels "" is a wonderful book for landscape enthusiasts. It is suitable for the serious beginner as well as the experienced artist.Ms Mowry gives detailed instructions on the techniques used in her paintings. It is filled with inspiration.If you are interested ln painting landscapes using soft pastels, this book is definitely one to add to your library."
3,Lighted Make-Up Mirror,If it wasn't for the fact that the little knob on the switch that turns the light on and off kept falling off I would recommend this for anyone who needed this kind of magnification.
5,One with Everything,"I'm no history buff but this book put me on that path - as well as the path to enlightenment. It is serious - but also seriously readable, making connections between the past and present, even while explaining the subject matter in comprehensive and fascinating style. Sutin, who also wrote the definitive biography of sci-fi avatar Philip K. Dick, has found a way to synthesize a huge quantity of material into a single compelling book that examines time-honored ideas in a new and exciting way."
2,WATCH OUT!!!,"My little on got his finget stuck in the spout trying to get the stuff out. Lotion, ice nothing worked, we had to call fire rescue. His finger is bruised but not broken."
1,Absolute garbage,"What a waste of a Christmas gift! This did not work right from the start. Within an hour of putting it together, the cheap plastic handle was broken, and the entire unit was rendered useless. Nothing like a gift from Santa that doesn't even create one squishee before breaking. My kids were VERY disappointed, and so am I. $25 down the drain."
1,PIECE OF JUNK! DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY!!!!,"Frankly, I'm surprised THE SIMPSONS allowed their brand name to be associated with this cheap product. Although they have similar incarnations with the ICEE Maker and the Slushee Maker. I'm convinced any ""positive reviews"" for this product were written by employees in the Marketing Department of the SpinMaster Toy Company. They seem totally fake.After following the instructions to the letter, multiple times, I am convinced this product only ""wastes your time and irritates the juice"".You'll end up making a wet mess and spinning and spinning the rotary handle for a long time only to flatten the soda and not see even one drop of slush.IN SHORT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY CONSIDERING THIS PRODUCT.

3,wrong cups,"I like the box but had to open it and unpack the whole thing only to find it did not really have ""Squishie"" cups. It just had plain cheap orange cups. I contacted Spinmaster and sent them my receipt and address and they assured me they would order and ship me ""Squishie"" cups. I have not received them yet.I haven't actually used it, I bought it for looks but want the right cups!"
4,Good overview,I enjoyed the book immensely. I found it to be a very good introduction to the fundamentals of the US university system. I would recommend it to anyone who is considering higher education either for study or as a career.
2,"Skip the Fodor's, Get the Lonely Planet Instead","I bought this book and carried it along with me to Morocco, along with a couple of other travel guides. I found this one to be the least useful, and I abandoned it along the way to lighten my load. In my opinion, the Lonely Planet Guide was the best. I would advise against wasting your money on this one."
5,Cobras in his garden,"The memory of reading this book as a 5th grader has stayed with me throughout my life. When I got my first car at the age of 17, I immediatly drove to the Miami Serpatarium to visit this amazing man. Truly one of my childhood heros."
2,I kinda disappointed of this new album,"I kinda feel like wasted 14 buck on this album , only songs i liked is "" Megalomaniac"" and "" Here in my room"" all other songs like trash, all sound the same, mades me think that they never put time and heart on it, i cant find any of the great sense of musical from "" make yourself"" and "" morning view"" in this new hopeless album. well i sugguest you people listen to the samples before getting it or borrow from your friends or something before you think is good to buy it."
3,Incubus have taken a two steps forward and one step back.,"In my opinion, Incubus have taken a two steps forward and one step back.ACLOTM was a good progression, although their new member may have swayed their sound a little. I also own S.C.I.E.N.C.E, Make Yourself and Morning View. I am buying Fungus.... also. Incubus and Nirvana are the two greatest bands in history, so you may think me a little biased.'Megalomaniac' was good, although some tracks were lacking a little. The lead on the album is good, but the base needs improvement. Brandons voice was good, although he should have shouted less on some songs. Sad to say, but the material in 'Make Yourself' far outdid this album. For Incubus fans this is a must, but if I had to recommend Incubus to a non-fan, this would be the last album I'd choose."
1,The Fall Of Incubus,"As a long time Incubus fan, this album is very disapointing. There is no DJ track, the lyrics are extreemly lacking incontent, and the music seems to have taken on quite a generic sound. This album is boring to say the least. The only track that jumpped out to my attention was ""Sick Sad Little World"", and it should have been about 2 1/2 minutes shorter then it is. I'll stick with not buying this album and deleting my downloaded copy. Thank the world that MP3's were invented to preview albums before you go to the store and spend your hard earned money on it!"
1,STRAIGHT GARBAGE,THis album is terrible.......incubus i dont know wut u guyz did for the last 2 albums.......those were really tight.......this is straight garbage.....I want the old incubus damnit
3,This wasn't a bad CD....,"This CD is just a long shot from other Incubus CDs. In a usual Incubus CD, I can listen to the whole thing without skipping a track. In this CD I found myself skipping tracks here and there however. It isn't a bad CD though...I just know that Incubus can put out much stronger material. So, if you're looking for a good CD then you'll enjoy this CD but if you're looking for another great CD (it isn't here) then you might be dissapointed."
5,It blew me away!,"This album is exquisite! I have been an incubus fan for years, and I feel that they ""let loose"" on this cd. I absolutely love it. It's harder than their last album, but shows the versatility of the band. They always seem to capture me with their raw lyrics that I like to apply to my own life and thier unique sound is like no other. This album is a must!"
2,What Happened?!,"Very disappointed. Long time Incubus fan and I have every CD including this one unfortunately. To me, Incubus is the kind of band that matures with every album. From Fungus Amongus to SCIENCE to Make Yourself to Morning View, I was really feeling their transitions and progress and maturaty as musicians. But this album took me back to Fungus Amongus. It sounded like a bunch of 15 year olds playing with instruments in a garage. I am very disappointed and surprised actually. I must say that the only song that I like enough is Megalomaniac. But I hate the message and feel that the video is a bit extreme. But I like the way that they're expressing their point and I love the sound of the song. So my advice to anyone contemplating the purchase of this CD is, don't expect another Morning View or Make Yourself. And if you're ok with that, then you can probably be alright with it."
4,A nice surprise,"I'm generally someone who listens to more metally kinda stuff, but my sister recommended Incubus to me and I got this CD because I had a bit of spare cash. Lucky me. My (alt)metal taste buds were wetted by the excellent 'Megalomaniac', and when the music changed direction suddenly, I was a bit worried by the severely underwhelming 'A Crow Left Of The Murder'. Fortunately, the rest of the album is back on track, beautiful and calm, but with an edge (especially on tracks like 'Sick, Sad Little World')Well done, Incubus... give yourself a pat on the back."
4,A crow left of a great album,"After the Mellowed out experimental ""Morning View"" Incubus returns with some more familiar hard rocking songs like ""Megalomaniac"" and ""A Crow left of the Murder."" In a sense its a return to the old days but not quite, You can definately sense a ""Bridge"" between A Crow left of the Murder and Morning View. Even though the heavy guitar is more present there is still alot of leftover melody from pervious albums. Which helps to give A crow left.. A new style in its own right. The standout from this album is ""Sick sad little world,"" Perhaps one of Incubus's best and most epic songs yet. But it also contains a few decent ballads, ""Here in my room"" and ""Southern Girl."" It's has a few flaws such as ""Priceless,"" But other great songs make up for that. It does take growing time as do most Incubus albums but in the end its worth it. A crow left of the murder is a very satisfying glimpse of what Incubus is capable of."
3,Good but not the best.,"This album is good... But fails in comparison to most every other Incubus album. I think Science, Make Yourself, Morning View, and even Fungus Amongus are better albums than this one...If you are a fan of the more mellow Incubus(Morning View) then this may be good for you. If your a fan of the funkier stuff give Fungus Amongus a shot it is pretty good for what it is. Everyone who likes Incubus should own Science, it doesn't get much better."
3,Pretty Average,"There are a few good songs on here such as Megalomaniac but a lot of it is a mixed bag. The lyrics to some of the songs are just really stupid.""We'll behave like animalsswing from tree to treewe can do anythingthat turns you up and sets you free""Really really lame! There's another song that just says, ""The look on your face was priceless."" over and over again. It seems to me like this is a collection of leftovers from other Incubus CDS rather than a brand new effort. Also, it doesn't help that the vocals are turned up in the mix to make them the focus. The drums, the samples and atmoshere, are too low in the mix. Another negative for this is the fact that the music video for Megalomaniac copied Ohgr's Majik video that was made in July of 2003. I don't know if Incubus is involved in this. It's more of the music video director's doing than them. This album is pretty average. Go check out Ohgr's SunnyPsyOp album for something more interesting and political."
2,Manufactured Rebellion,"The music industry has once again taken an important movement and commercialized it for the teenybopper masses. Rideing the bandwagon of other bands with anti-Bush politics such as System of a Down, Ohgr, and many others that were actually honest in their anti-War viewpoint, the music executives have milked the anti-Bush sentiments to create their own trendy form or commercialized rebellion. Ohgr, an underground electronic Industrial band with the vocalist from Skinny Puppy, created a music video almost a year ago with the exact visuals that are now used in the Megalomaniac music video. Bush as a tyrant, the gas pump at the podium, and Bush's transition into a demonic creature are elements found in both the Majik video by Ohgr and the Megalomaniac video by Incubus. Sadly, Incubus has none of the talent, insight, or artistic vision of the bands they're trying to immitate. What's the point of your message if there is no honesy or originality?"
5,Best Incubus album,This is the best Incubus album yet! the first time i listened to it i was blown away by the awesome songs. i kept turning the valume. it is just plain great.
5,EXCELLENT RELEASE!!!,"I was never an Incubus fan, Before. Although, I do own all of there other cd's. I just hardly ever listen to them, Since the songs pretty much all sound the same and it gets boring after awhile.But, After hearing ""A Crow Left To The Murder"" I am a big fan, Now.This release is Excellent for the simple fact that the band tried something different this time and didn't make the same sounding songs they kept doing over and over.The simple fact that Incubus decided to move away from what everyone expected them to do and experiment a little more and get a little harder sound and didn't make ""Every"" song a mellow ""Radio tune"".I applaud Incubus for this release.I really have no idea why anyone is complaining about this cd, It still sounds like Incubus and I believe it's the bands strongest and most diverse cd.If you don't like it SHUT UP and go sell your copy to the ""Used"" cd store and buy something else."
4,For Incubus Fans,"always changing and reinventing themselves, incubus has always managed to write very introverted albums, and a crow left of the murder is no exception. contrary to the megalomaniac video, it is not a political statement, like a rage or system album. it stays true to former themes, but it doesnt resemble former albums. incubus continues to be innovative and the new album is musically/technically evolutionary; very different. it is a great album, but dont expect many mega-pop-hits, this album is for the fans."
5,Great CD..Innovation and Change at its best,"This cd is not the normal incubus, which is good. Not that i didnt love their old stuff, but a good band can only keep being good with change. Everyone always freaks out when bands put out a different cd, but its always for the better in my opinion and so is this cd. The guitar playing on this cd is amazing, and the bands sounds great...Keep it up guys"
3,Doesn't really grow over time,"I like Incubus, but this album reflects how I feel about the band overall....it doesn't really grow on me. If anyone asks if I like Incubus, I can't say no, but it's not like I love them either. Is this a good album? I guess so. There are some really good songs on here like ""Pistola"" and ""Talk Show On Mute"" The title track is a good one too. But I've listened to this album a lot and can't really remember that much when it's done. There's no doubt that Mike is an innovative guitarist, but maybe it's just some weak songwriting here. To me, ""Morning View"" is a better album."
4,Thoughts from a new fan...,"Forget ""Megalomaniac."" The rest of the CD kicks all kinds of ass. Brendan Boyd is actually a talented songwriter and singer, and it really shows here. The songs have a strong pop sensability, but perhaps in just this one case, thats a good thing.Buy it, its brilliant."
2,What is this?,"I'm a huge fan of Incubus. All of their albums are very good, original, creative. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for their new release.I'm really surprised with how generic it sounds. Incubus now sounds like every other ""nu-metal"" band on the radio and MTV, and it's rather dissapointing.While their previous albums have been unlike any other band out there, this sounds like everything else I hear on the radio. They've let me down in a big way."
4,GIVE IT A TRY,"First off, whevever i read a review of someone who says that morning view was a good cd, I instantly form a biased that they have no idea what they are talking about. Morning View was a sub-performance from the guys of incubus. That is one of the reasons why Dirk left the band. He left it when they were instudio because he couldn't deal with anymore of brandon and his need to try to pick up women with his music. They used to cover megadeath, and now brandon was talking about pouring chocolate on a womans chest. thats a huge jump. All that said, i got the cd to give it a whirl, i made the mistake of looking for something along the lines of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. , its not like it. My first play i was disallusioned. I gave it a few more chances and it grew on me. its not science, its not morning view (thank god) but its good and i think they are moving in either the right direction, or at least a better direction then before. Give it a whirl or two , you might find you enjoy it, i know i did"
1,Awful,"Hard to believe just 7 year ago this band(minus 2 members) put out one of the greatest albums ever in my opinion. ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" was amazing...I knew any hope for this band ever being good again was gone when their bassist Alex bolted. He was the best overall talent in the band and it will be interesting to see where he shows up. The first 3 Incubus albums would make anyone playing bass applaud, however the last 3 would serve as a ""how to learn bass"" booklet.Back to the album. It's bad. 2...maybe 3 worthwhile songs and the rest are junk. Ironically, this album reminds me of newer Pearl Jam works check out ""Talk Shows On Mute"" and then go listen to PJ's ""Wishlist""...""Zee Deevel""=PJ's ""Rival""...Anyway, steer clear of this album and invest in ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."""
2,Incubus of old is gone,"Ok, I loved Science and some of the earlier stuff. They were funky, heavy, jazzy and it worked to make a hell of a unique sound. Make yourself was ok, had a couple real good songs but their direction was changing, In morning view their direction changed even more. Now in this new album the direction is complete, they are hovering the line between rock and progressive rock. They are very good, creative musicians but this CD lacks any edge that many of ealrier album fans still crave, including myself. I can appreciate their effort and skill but its not for me."
1,Incubus has lost their way!,"I've been a big Incubus fan for years and anxiously awaited this new album, but unfortunately, with the exception of maybe four tracks, the new C.D. is almost unlistenable! I find myself skipping songs because they're so irritating, I can't get to the end of them. This is NOT your typical Incubus album, and if you think it is, you will be disappointed."
1,Unfortunately,"I'm sad to say this is the worst album to date. I heard it was supposed to be the most rockin' one yet, but in my opinion it fell short of what i'd expected. they're so much more talented than this. Megalomaniac rocks, but that's about it. I'm so disappointed."
2,What happened?,"I usually always preview CDs before i buy them, but i figured the Incubus would be a sure bet given their histroy. As I began to listen to it, I was disappointed w/ each passing track. The new disc is really missing something & just seems scattered. The songs just don't flow. I have always been a huge Incubus fan starting w/ the 1996 release ""Enjoy Incubus"". I really miss the smoothness from previous releases. I didn't expect the same as before -just better."
2,Wish it was what it wasn't,"I've tried liking this album. I've tried listening to it when I was in a good mood. I've tried saying GOOD things about it, but it just doesn't measure up to what it could have been. Folks, I recommend this cd for people who don't know Incubus very well. It sounds good, but I've been spoiled on their older stuff. The only thing that goes through my head when I listen to this album is the fact that they could definitely have done better..."
4,why r u guys so critcal?,ok...i will start off by saying that this cd is definetly not their but. But that does not mean this is a bad album. This album has a lot of really great songs. Their first sinle 'megalomaniac' is an awesome song. Southern Girl is a nice slower some. So many many more songs are great but im too lazy to talk about them all. Please dont listen to all those people comparing it to their other albums. Make your own opinian.
3,Incubus - A Crow Left Of The Murder,"Okay, when I first heard ""Megalomaniac"" on FUSE, the song and the video was awesome, the video is even banned on day-time T.V., how cool is that? But lets face it, I can't lie to you, this album sucks compared to ""Make Yourself"" & ""Morning View"", the only good tracks are ""Megalomaniac"", ""A Crow Left Of The Murder"", & ""Sick, Sad Little World""... If you're looking for some Incubus enjoyment, get ""Make Yourself"" and ""Morning View"" instead, just download ""Megalomaniac"" instead and buy ""Brand New - Deja Entendu"" instead..."
3,"No 'morning view', but does take some chances","This is not Incubus's best album. It is a fairly good album overall, but it is not their best work.Too many of the tracks, like 'sick little world' and 'agoraphobia' are plain and uninteresting. I'd rather have a shorter album than have to suffer through boring songs.On the other hand, some of the songs, like 'Megalomaniac' and 'Southern Girl' are good songs - too bad the rest of the album isn't up to the task.The mantra of all pop music groups has to be ""change or die"", and incubus has done that. You won't even hear a single record scratch on this whole album! Instead they use electronic noise in some places, somewhat related to what radiohead has done (on a much more limited scale, though).I'm looking forward to catching incubus in concert this summer - they'll pull the good songs off of this album and add it to their already great collection, and make a great show. But too bad not all of the songs are good."
3,Let Down...,"I was disapointed with this CD. It does have a few good tracks. and Meglomaniac is a great song, but its just not Incubis. I listen to just about every type of music there is, but i would have never expected this from Incubis. Granted these songs aren't terrible, but i'd rather hear them from someone i didn't like as much. Make Yourself and Morning View set a standard for what Incubis was capable of. When i first bought Make Yourself, it didn't leave the CD player in my car for 2 weeks, i listened to the cd all the way through about everday. then Morning View came, that stayed in for about a week. sadly enough a crow left of the murder didn't make it a whole day. If your looking for another Make Yourself, you aren't gonna find it here. im sure it might grow on me, but for now, im just dissappointed..."
1,So I'm an idiot for expressing an opinion?,"I'd say the real idiot is the frightened little boy who writes ""rob walsh is an idiot, go kill yourself"". I have some news for you kid, it's fun to talk smack on the internet and not get caught, but those rules don't apply in real life. I doubt you have the testicular know-how to back up your inter-self alter ego if we met on the street, coward.And I gave it a listen, and my fears where confirmed. Don't get me wrong, I still like the old material, but not a fan anymore and that's just the way it goes."
1,This is not Incubus,"Ok first of all change is not ""good."" When you want to hear some nasty 70's rock you listen to AC/DC, when you want to hear industrial dance music you listen to Nine Inch Nails. Get the point? All the great bands can do different things without losing their edge. What if Trent Reznor put out a jazz record? It would be horrible. If you want to listen to Incubus, then listen to s.c.i.e.n.c.e. This stuff is just far too soft and commercial. There's no edge to it, no soul."
2,What happened guys?,"Look i LOVE incubus...always have, always will..great musicians and love what they do...but this album was a let down to say the least....i was pumped when i heard it was coming out...i almost bought it before it was even released...glad i didnt..i did buy it and im not sorry that i supported incubus...but this album lacks what the previous albums had...balls..great riffs...hard and soft sounds...not some wierd stuff with no chorus..beats..nothing, just a bunch of random workd on a page with some music...its not that the quality is bad..but it lacks the grungy/mello sounds of Make Yourself, morning view, and Science.....those were albums i could listen to over and over..this is not...maybe the members of Incubus have become meglomaniacs in their own way because this just cannot be the same Incubus i remeber, they've gone crazy in thinking that they'll make any money of this album."
2,generic!,"I'd read some mixed reviews of the CD before I picked it up.. Having been a fan of the band since 'Enjoy' came out in the UK years ago.. I figured that I'd make up my own mind... afterall, 'Morning View' is 1 of the finest records out there! This, on the other hand is the sound of a band NOT trying!. Over half of the tracks are lumpen and dull.. O'brian's production is lifeless and much of the uniqueness of Incubus is lost.. Only the latter half of the record saves the day (apart from 'pistola'.. which sucks!). I am REALLY disappointed with this.. (can u guess!). Brandon's vocals appear to have altered too.. he now sounds like Brian from PLACEBO.. very irritating.. and DJ Killmore has very little to do.. If your'e a longtime fan.. I suggest you go and look at I MOTHER EARTH and their latest CD ' THE QUICKSIVER MEAT DREAM' instead.. it's 100 times better than this! and u might discover something new in the process!"
3,lost direction,"love incubus first cd, seen them in concert twice, very talented, very tight. it seems like they may have lost their direction, the first cd was stellar. the second had a few good tracks but seemed to lack the creativity and magic of the first.hopefully the 3rd will be great."
2,Buy it because it's Incubus,"At first listen the album is what you would expect it to be after hearing their first single, Megalomaniac. Unfortunately for the album this isn't a good quality. The music instrumentation is actually quite good, but for most of the album Brandon's subpar lyrics (""Do you get it"" x50) and screams for the sake of screaming take away from songs that have great potential underneath. Morning View picked up where Make Yourself left off expanding their musical concepts, this album just seems like a step back. Each album has been a different version of Incubus and I'm happy for that, it's just too bad we'll have to wait another three years to see them evolve again."
1,What Happened?!?!,"I'm confused as to what direction this band is headed, but if this is it, I'm going elsewhere! Other than the first track this album just drags and drags, slow song after slow song. Nothing is upbeat. I've been waiting for this CD for months now and I get it the day it comes out only to be rewarded with this... Save your money and get the new Hoobastank CD."
4,Incubus is still Incubus,"Incubus's last two major releases, Moning View and Make Yourself were easily 5-star cd's, leaving impossible expectations for thier follow-up. Firstly the album was written very fastly and there was a key change in the line-up, but the cd is still them. At first impression it is not that great, after knowing songs like Drive, Stellar and I Wish You Were Here from thier last two albums, you want more, and with the cd lacking many stand-out songs, you may not be too impressed right away. But your second or third time through the album, you will realize the cd is really good. You just have to see that it blows out most other CD's, just not the past work of Incubus."
4,someone else please help me out on this,"if you're a true incubus fan, and i'm talking all the way back before mtv exposure, then you know their progression. this album is right in line with everything they've done since science, from which their signature sound is derived. i'm not saying it's as good or ground breaking as science, simply using it as precedence. it does sound a little more mainstream, but i think that is more a result of mainstream coming to them rather than the alternative. i'll admit i do skip over megalomaniac most times, but that's a result of over-exposure more than anything. if you're looking for a good album to leave in the car for a couple weeks straight and let it keep playing through this one's great. buy it.just as a side note if you kind of like incubus go see them live and you'll come away loving them. their quality and composition only improves outside of the studio."
3,WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?!?!?,"I was waiting for the ultimate return of Incubus but what I got was I don't know, just very disappointing. What happened to the great magic this band had? it all went away! seriously if you're going to buy this CD, buy it used, it is not that great at all with the exception of ""Megalomaniac"" that is about it!"
3,Eh....,"This CD was alright. It didn't live up to the other CDs that they have made. I only found a few songs to be pretty good. I have to admit that the guitar was awesome, though. The lyrics were the main problem IMO."
3,Could've done better,"This CD is just not quite as good as ""Make Yourself"" and the great ""Morning View"" were. Incubus just doesnt seem to have the same fire as they did before. It sounds like they are trying to become more mainstream, when they had perfected their own sound before. Still, it is not too bad of a CD. It just isn't up to par with the other Incubus CDs."
2,disappointed,"As a long time fan of Incubus, and someone who owns every cd they have come out with, I was very anxious for the release of this cd; I couldn't wait to get it in my car,and put it in my player, and turn it UP. I was disappointed. I knew it would be hard for them to top Morning View, but I never imagined they would make such a drastic change in their style. There are what I consider to be a few good songs on the disc, but I wish I hadn't bought it. Very disappointed in this endeavor from Incubus.A year later, I like it a lot more than originally, but still not up to par."
5,Whats the matter with some of you people!,"When i saw that some people were giveing this album 1, 2 stars i was in awe. This is a great cd, every song on it is great, the only song that i am not that fond of yet is Here in my room, but ill give it some more time. Also i dont understand how people are giving this such terrible reviews even though it just came out yesterday! You cant just listen to it once and decide if its great or crap. All i can say to the people who dont like it our were upset because they wanted it to sound just like ""Morning View"" and it didnt is to give it another listen if that doesnt work listen again. Its a great album from a great band"
2,2 for the effort,"I used to love Incubus, the music was so vivid and it completely wrapped you up in it and in some songs, spit you back out. The point is, it made you feel. This... doesn't do that. Sure, it sounds like Incubus, it just doesn't feel like it. There's nothing to get wrapped up in, just a lot of stuff to spit out."
4,Salvation,"Just when I'd given up on finding a new grove for 2004 along comes ""A Crow Left Of The Murder"". I'd say it combines the sophistication of their effort with the quirky passion of their earlier albums. Buy it you'll see."
4,So so...,"This is NOT a bad cd, just not as good as Make Yourself... I hated Morning View and this album runs circles around it."
1,OH MY GOD!!!,"I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst CD I own. This is complete and utter trash. Why has Incubus decided to become a sell-out protest band by saying how much they hate Bush? Sure, I don't agree with a lot of our President's decisions, but I don't want to hear about it on a rock album. If I want to hear about that I'll turn on CNN. Incubus was (notice the was) my favorite band before this album. Only two or three songs stick out. All of the songs in the middle sound like one giant song. They all sound the same. If you truly truly like this CD, then you most likely are the ""Anarchy in the UK"" type of lemming. But hey, that's just my opinion."
1,not what I expected,"I don't know what I was thinking picking up this album. I talked to a friend who really likes good indie stuff and had all good things to say about this album, so I figured what the hey I'll get it and maybe I will be surprised....wrong! I just couldn't get into the album at all, I try to listen to it but halfway through get bored and switch to something from Cursive. There's no emotion at all in Brandon Boyd's voice...i don't know what else to say because I got nothing from this cd, and probably won't even keep it."
1,These guys need some time off,"This is not a good CD in terms of music or recording:This CD is quite different from their previous work, stylistically-speaking and very much so in terms of the quality of the music in general, which is poor. The overall effect (speaking as a musician) is one of experimentation. Parts of it bring to mind old YES or even Robert Fripp, which is interesting but the music lacks a sense of melody one finds with YES. The CD, as a project is very much unfocused in material and recorded sound (though the engineer did the best that he could).The older material of Incubus is just better, better recorded sound, better music, better musical concept. I would skip this one entirely and wait until they regain their focus or until the label kills them. I realize this review is different from many before but then there is no accounting for taste, rabid fans or professional point fixers that pump up the review points for ailing bands."
3,doesnt sound like incubus and what happened to dirk?!!,"When this album was about to come out i was excited. i even went to the studio in atlanta they recorded at b/c i know the producer. When i listen to it its an alright cd but it doesnt sound like them at all. All the songs on SCIENCE, MAKE YOURSELF, and MORNING VIEW i love. morning view is there best album and is prob. one of my favorite ones. i know theyre tryin somethin different but it doesnt sound good. the only good songs r MEGLOMANIAC, PISTOLA, and SICK SAD LITTLE WORLD. And what happened to dirk lance the bassist????? there new bass player is nothing compared to dirk (BY THE WAY DIRK IF UR OUT THERE I HOPE U GET ANOTHER BAND GOIN B/C THATS HORRIBLE THAT UR OUT). But the cd is alright but i seriously think there nex album should be a MELLOW SOUNDING album b/c they play it so well! and they will def. get a lot of fans hooked. but if u want to e mail me more about incubus b/c i have every album and i know a lot about them u can."
1,Horrible!,I hate to be critical but this album is terrible. I'm a huge Incubus fan and it seems like they haven't been able to pull together a decent album since Make Yourself. Just when I thought Morning View was as boring and uninspired as Incubus could get they came out with this! It's a shame becuase once upon a time they used to be a really good band...
5,perfect combination of everything,"this album is by par the best work by incubus..it leads you down a path like a blind-folded kid seeking comfort in everyway..it is a change one would embrace..Brandon is one hell of an artist,his vocal dynamics is just perfect as it is..:P plus, he's got Ben Kenney working with him on vocals, if you listen to beware criminal, they layered the vocals so perfectly..Mike is a monster guitarist!!I cant compare Incubus to other bands like Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit(i like wes though)..in my opinion, they're even better than red hot chilli peppers(you may disagree)..to resist is to piss in the wind.."
1,R.I.P. INCUBUS...,"I'm so disapointed at this band. SCIENCE was so fresh and inovative, Finally, a band to replace the mighty Faith No More I thought..... wrong! Every release since SCIENCE has been a turn to radio friendlyness, not that that's a bad thing, put when you have so much creativity and talent as Incubus obviously showed with thier first major release, I would expect them not to sell themselves short by catering to making radio friendly hits."
2,Fall from greatness,"Just like every other Incubus fan out there, I anticipated the new album for a very long time. From what I can tell, I'm not alone when I say I am very disappointed. I bought the cd the day it came out and I've tried to listen to it and get in to it but it just never happened. I put 2 songs from the cd on to my iTunes and took the cd and sold it to a second spin cd store for 3 bucks. In a nutshell...Incubus went from one of the most creative and innovative rock bands out there to the sounds of many of the watered-down, so called ""rock"" bands you hear on radio today....such as Jet, The Strokes, The Vines, and the Hives...all of which suck. Save your money and just turn on the radio if you really wanna hear this crap. Incubus pulled a Pearl Jam and I'm not buying it. Save your money and go buy the new Breaking Benjamin, Flaw, Edgewater, Seven Wiser, Thornley, Lo-Pro, or Strata (July 27). Hopefully this is a stage and Incubus will return to greatness on their next effort."
1,What a dissapointment.....,"Well, Brandon forgot how to sing, the instrumentals have become mediocre, and their new image is pathetic. I can't believe people ARE diggin' this!! From a certain shade of green to morning view, this band wrote incredible, beautiful, respectible songs. their acoustic work was phenominal, and their full on rock stuff on make yourself was just awesome. This just sucks. do yourself a favor & accept the fact that their single IS the best song on the album, and even it sucks. I hope Incubus pulls their crap together for the next album, and re-discover the sound that they created for themselves, rather than this retro-wannabe shlok."
1,what were they thinking,"to be honest, i am a new incubus fan. I have always heard their music, but i did not put a name w/ the music until megalomanic. well ne ways, i dont just hear 1 song and scream i a hardcord fan, i did some research, bought some of their old cd's and listened. compared to all their other cd's (...), but their are some good songs on there: here in my room (it's a little dif for them, but i like it), pistola, and sick sad lil wrld. but dude, what were they thinking- this cd will test fans to see how true they are. i know no matter what, i still luv incubus, im not discouraged. (...), but then i remembered this is the group that made redefine, pardon me, make yourslef, etc. so if you are a new incubus fan bcuz of megalomanic, dont let this cd make u think this is incubus, go by their old stuff (s.c.i.e.n.c.e, make yourself, morning view, fungus amongus (it's very interesting), and an acoustic or live cd) youll still love them. but man what were they thinking?"
3,Identity Crisis?,"I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and trash this CD. Nope.. won't do it.. Simply because this CD is 10 times better than most of the garbage thats out there in mainstream rock. The only reason these so called Incubus fans feel betrayed by the quality of this album is because the last CD was so freakin amazin. And while the lack of basslines like that found on ""Are U In"" definatley hurt the overall quality of this CD it is still a good buy if you are a true incubus fan and didn't jump on their wagon when ""Warning"" hit MTV.On a side note: If you listen close you might be able to hear Brandon doing his best at impersonating Serj from System of a Down on a few songs.."
5,it's out of control how much talent these guys have.,"To me music doesn't get much better then this, how can u make a cd in 4 weeks and it be this good. its great"
4,hmmm...,"Well, this album is different. So, Dirk is gone. And they now have a Hip-hop bassist. I do like this album, maybe Brandon high-pitches a little too much and maybe you can't hear Kilmore enough, but, the cd does have the rock element incubi always has. I love incubus and always will and hope that they surprise me a little better than this next. But it is a good album, I just like rock a lot more and it lacked as much rock as I would have liked thats all!! Balls"
1,what happens when you want the album to be too unique,"this album sucks, iv been a incubus fan for as long as i can remeber well not really like since s.c.i.e.n.c.e came out (i was like 8 i think haha) and even though the band was totally (rude) to me at a album signing few years ago for the last good album so far called mourning view (go check out that or make yourself those are great) this cd in my opinion sucks and i intially felt it would when it took a minute for the first song to start and listened to the songs, i hate this cd lol i really do and i get mad cause i just realized that now incubus sucks because before they werent nice but the music made up for it and now with that gone what do they have left to show? NOTHING, buy their old stuff it has more talent and creativity and greatness than this cd ever could."
2,worst cd since fungus amungus,"even ""enjoy incubus"" was better than this. their sound has changed with each studio recorded cd, which is the sign of a truly talented band, but this latest effort was just not what i was hoping to hear. instead of being able to through this in the cd player and go workout or somthing like that, you need to put it in then fall asleep. they need to get their sound back to the ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E"" or ""make yourself"" era, or better yet, combine the two! after trying to listen to it over and over again to see if it would grow on me, it didnt...hopefully for fans sakes they play older music in their upcoming U.S. tour starting june. this cd isnt worth paying the money to hear them play!"
2,Nothing New,"The problem with this CD is that after 8-9 loops playing on my CD player I couldn't get into it. As someone else on this page stated you can't help what you like. The album in my opinion just drags on and on. There is nothing catchy about it and although many people have listed they change their sound, well they really don't. If I were Incubus and had the musical talent they possess, which is a little above average, I would stick to the same formula for my music. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of stuff out there that lacks creativity and Incubus definitely has that, however while listening to the CD now I find myself falling asleep <yawn> heard it - nothing new. By the way you can read the reviews of diehard Incubus fans that will tell you it's great. I respect that I suppose - I mean you have those friends that support sports teams no matter how horrible they are, this is the same."
1,suckubus,if i could give this album less than one star i would. with every cd after SCIENCE they have gotten progressively worse. there is no heart in the music anymore. take my advise and save your money. this album soulds like brandon took a dump and recorded it.
1,What a horrible album!!!!!!!!!!,"The old incubus was so much better, compared to this new upbeat style. my favorite albums were morning view, make yourself, and fungusamongus. I would consider this to be their worst album yet. The more mellow style of the old incubus was superior to this junk. i found one good song on the whole album, which was megalomaniac. other than that all the other songs were unbearable"
3,WHY INCUBUS WHY???,"Why di u change incubus-SCICNECE was your best album then make yourself came and that was great this morning view came which was alright but then your new cd ACLOTM which is boring and just a total dissapointment-go back to your old roots make your next cd harder and more uniqe like how sciecne was.dont listen to MTV and have them tell you what to do, and brandon please grow back your dreads!"
2,Dissapointment all around,"Ok theres only like 4 good songs on this cd: Megalomanic, Pistola, Sick Sad Little World and Zee Deevel. The rest of the songs are slow and void of interest, theres nothing that really takes off. Its a slow and more mainstreamed approach to rock. I love the other two incubus cds i have: Make Yourself and Morning View but this one just doesnt sit right with me. If you like the other two cds you may not like this, You have been warned but if you like soft jazz rock which never really lifts off the ground and feel like sleeping bring your pillow and a cd player and this cd and drift off to sleep. BTW (The look on your face after reading this review was 'PRICELESS')"
1,SACD mix just as compressed as CD mix,"I have listened to both the stereo CD and stereo SACD mix. The mix is slightly improved on the SACD layer, but it still pegs the meters at -0.1 dBFS. Why go through all of the trouble to create an SACD version of this album that is just as slammed as the CD version? I love the music on this album, but unfortunately both layers sound like compressed garbage. Do not buy."
2,Hugely disappointing,"I understand that bands change and develop, in fact I expect them to. But this CD is a change for the worse. I was a fan of all their previous albums, but I can't even listen to this album all the way through. It's boring and not really all that musical. I wish all the songs had the same zest and creativity of the first track, ""Megalomaniac."" There are a few other OK tracks but nothing interests me enough to make me put the CD back in my stereo."
3,Just not my favorite side of Incubus,"I like the heavier side of them, not the experimental side. I was very hopeful that this would be a return to form (for me at least), and after I heard ""Megalomaniac"", I was excited about the possibilities, because that quickly became one of my favorite Incubus tracks. While this is far from a bad album, I kind of have to be in the right mood to listen to it, and if I feel like some Incubus, I'm more likely to go for the earlier stuff. There are some good songs on here, but to me, they don't have as much of a lasting impact as previous ones."
2,A disappointing album,"I have been listening to ACLOTM over and over, hoping it will grow on me and it hasn't. I find the album to be an intermediary between the styles of ""Morning View"" and ""Light Grenades."" There are traces of the Incubus from ""Make Yourself"" but you can clearly hear the direction the band is taking. Very pop, not much rock. The lyrics are trying to hold onto the social commentary and self-awareness of the earlier works but the music behind them is weak. Unoriginal, awkward, predictable melodies and vocals are found in most of the songs. It feels like they were deliberately trying to write radio-friendly songs that pander to the lowest common denominator listeners. It's albums like this that have kept me from buying anything that's been on the radio in the past decade because most of it is lame. I'm not as disappointed in ACLOTM as I am in ""Light Grenades"" though. I'm not sure why Incubus chose this musical path but I hope they do an about-face for their next album."
4,"Review this album for itself, not based on past albums!","Though not perfect, a solid effort from Incubus. One thing some people are failing to grasp is that each Incubus album is a progression. Those expecting to hear S.C.I.E.N.C.E, Make Yourself, Morning View, or Fungus Amungus are going to be dissapointed. As one reviewer noted, if you wanna hear those albums, go listen to them. This is definetely a rock album. Upon first listen I heard a lot of Soundgarden influence, especially on Made for TV Movie. Ultimately this album has something for everyone, granted your an open minded fan. I've read some ignorant reviews thus far. One said that Boyd should stop trying to be political and just sing like Make Yourself. Again, expecting an album that is already made. Also, if one would listen to any other Incubus album, there are political and social references in them as well! This album is just a bit more opinionated."
3,"give it a chance, but still not the best","Bottom line, this is a GOOD album---most of the songs are fun and very energetic---its just a select 4 or 5 that make it fall short of what i was expecting. A lot of people felt incubus took a wrong turn with morning view, and if you are in that school of thought, then you will probably love this album, however, i loved morning view and find ACLOTM to be less that stellar--- definatly buy the CD, it is well worth the money, but dont expect every song to be on your 'favorites' playlist.great songs -- megalomaniac, beware? criminal, pistola, sick, sad, little world, a crow left of the murder, smile lines, leechsongs that make me wonder what the hell incubus was thinking -southern girl, talkshows on mute, here in my room, zee deveel"
4,Give Incubus a break,"I waited for this CD and I got to hear the entire thing a week before it came out. I was not disapointed at all when I went out and bought it, why? They change their sound on each CD, and I think this one is a mixture of all their sounds. They switch it up so they won't sound like all the other crap that is out there. They have a new bass player as well, so I imagine they had a big change from Dirk to Ben. I agree... it isnt their best CD but it is good none the less. If your a big fan of Incubus, go out and get it sometime. This album didn't disapoint me, I knew a change from this band was comming, and it came with a force, and its pretty good.Songs to check out (besides megalomaniac): Agoraphobia, Beware! Criminal, Sick Sad Little World, pistola, Zee Deveel"
3,intresting CD,i LOve incubus. All there albums are great.but some take the next step and are awesome albums case in point make yourself.ACLOTM i thought this album sucked at first but you just have to listen to it a couple times to get use to the new sound.Personally i loved the make yourself album the best and morning veiw the next best.this album sounds like they are tring to hard to be a hard rock group i though they were going to scream at one point..incubus should go back to the chilled out so called stoner music thats what they do best and thats why i buy their cds and thats why i like them. Over all good cd not awesome but good
3,Just get it to complete your Incubus collection,"Ok first of all when this CD came out i didn't even know they were in the works of making a CD, Secondly I love Incubus, Thirdly i am kinda dissapointed in this CD and fourthly I just bought it because i wanted to complete my Incubus collection. just a handfull of the songs on this cd are ok but nothing spectacular not like from the their other previous CDs the two CDs before this train-wreck were great, no Spectacular, no wait Double-spectacular. but given the fact that those CDs were made when they were just climbing that great big social ladder to success, stardom and becoming rockstars it sad to say that when their success went up their talent somehow got lost along the way. even though this cd isn't their best i still love brandon boyd anyway, he just grew up and became trendy, let's just hope its just a phase."
4,something a bit eclectic,"Say what you will about this album, it remains a strong release. There are influences here that Incubus had yet to tap into. Their earlier material was primarily and obviously composed of funk, metal, and even rap. They have escaped that landscape and have produced an album of good character. I sense a bit of Rush-like prog rock and even Radiohead inspiration on the track ""In My Room"". It really is diverse and quite sprawling. I believe Mike Eizinger's, Ben Kenney's, and José Pasillas II's experience with the ""Time Lapse Consortium"" was and eye-opening event. Much is to learn from these stalwarts. Further, despite the fact that a few songs may sound a bit over-pretentious, Brandon truly pulls off those notes dwelling on a higher octave. Some may miss the funktified fury of S.C.I.E.N.C.E., but that is not to say that much is to be gained from their new journey."
2,2 stars at best,"definitely their worst album. the lyrics are trite and boring ""you're no jesus, you're no elvis""??? what is that garbage? unfortunately the only semi-decent song on the album is ""megalomaniac"" which isnt even that good. this album is mediocre at best.i am an incubus fan, but this album is downright disappointing. theres no edge, intensity, and after 30 seconds into a song, i drift off and stop paying attention. its really boring and i have to FORCE myself to focus just to hear the songs. dont buy this album. thumbs down and a boo to incubus."
2,APT TO CHANGE,"Even though I have not bought the CD, I have listen to the smples and I'm still impressed!! YES, it is soft, but it is Incubus and it sounds GREAT. I have been an Incubus fan for a long time and they have a distinct way of expressing themselves through music. They are a great band that had not sold out. Give Incubus a chance becasue if those who STILL are in ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E"" mode should look at other bands who do not change. BESIDES, CHANGE IS GOOD!!!"
3,Incubus has done better,I consider myself a hardcore Incubus fan and I too will get there new CDs forever. But they are always changing you cannot listen to all there CDs and think they are all the same. I am glad that they did not make another Morning View or S.C.I.E.N.C.E or Make Yourself. I like this CD but I think it could have been better. There best song ever was A Certain Shade of Green. Best album S.C.I.E.N.C.E. anyone who says different well has different opinions than I do (well yeah).
1,Surf's up dude!!!,"Sounds to me like these guys would rather be surfing than writing good tunes! What a big pile of crap this album is! This album nearly put me to sleep the first time i heard it! I had to listen to it a second time just to believe how boring this album was! Did they spend only one day on making this? Can someone tell me? I actually had to look inside the cover to find out if this was a b-sides album or not! Songs are just plain boring and the production is terrible! This band is supposed to be one of the biggest going around at the moment! There last two albums were fantastic, and had great success on the charts! This album should've been their crowning glory! But there is nothing on this album that will make me want to listen to it again! I think i will take it to a second hand dealer and get $2 for it and cut my losses! If cd's could smell, this would smell like s@#T!!! Avoid at all costs!!!!!!"
4,Give It a 2nd Chance,"At first listen, A Crow Left of the Murder sounds strange, and not what I was expecting from Incubus. To be completely honest, I didn't like this cd the first time around. I tried listening to it again, and it wasn't as bad as I thought. I think this album takes a little bit to get used to. Don't play it once, and discard because you thought it was crap. Give it a second chance, it's well worth it."
5,Another Masterpiece,"Definetley a great album. It doesn't matter whether you're a ""true Incubus fan"" or not (I guess I'm not, because I don't think Fungus Amongus is the best album), you'll enjoy listening to this album. My favorites are ""Beware! Criminal"" and ""Priceless"", but each song is just as infectious and meaningful as the last (besides ""A Crow Left of the Murder"", which I think sounds a bit hokey). Everyone should own a copy of this album, one way or another."
4,"Solid, but lackin.","This is a very nice album. Personally I was expecting something a little more HipHop, seeing as how Ben Kenny from The Roots took Lance's place. This album is way more rock and often sounds like they're looking for a new sound but couldn't fine it. On some songs they sound like Nirvana, then on other they sound like STP and Weezer. They would have done much better, I think, if they produced the album themselves instead of grabbing Brendan O'Brien. He had them sounding like something other than themselves. I'm a huge fan of HipHop so hopefully they'll move that direction on the next album. Best song on the ablum - Sick Sad Little Word, Worst - Zee Deveel. This is definately not a Homerun, more like a base clearing Triple. They kicked ass at Lollapalooza. Can't wait for the tour, hopefully they tour with J5. That'd be FAT."
2,What Happened?,What happened to the old Incubus? The days of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself are slowly fading away. After Megalomaniac this cd lost my interest very quickly! It leaves a certain feeling of wanting a full refund for my poor investment!
4,"a crow plants a seed into my ears, a beautiful lotus emerges","new incubus cd is deckest i've heard in a while.lots of experimentation, explosive guitar solos played with wah through a leslie speaker cabinet, beefy bass lines, some intricate yet simple drumming, falsetto with signature rhythmic phrasing on the vocals. not so much turntables as their previous records which disappoints me, however the fact that this record sounds like it was made in a robot factory satisfies me enough. the dub neo-funk interludes and post-jungle breakdowns make it really interesting to listen to, more unexpected turns than any of their records. probably their best record since 's.c.i.e.n.c.e.' my favourite tracks are 'agoraphobia' , 'sick sad little world' , 'pistola' , 'megalomaniac' and 'southern girl'. and that is without listening to the last four or so cuts. i think it is mike einzinger's best guitar work yet."
5,Very solid effort,"This album, although bashed by many incubus fans, is definately up for contention for the year's best rock album. Mike's guitar work is truely amazing, something you do NOT find on the radio nowadays. Not many power chords used, and the guitars on ""Sick, Sad, Little World"" are just plain sick. I have always appreciated those who strive to innovate (The Beatles, Hendrix, Pink Floyd), and incubus is no exception. This album is definately one of their best, even considering their old stuff. Any rock fan would enjoy listening to this."
1,WHAT IS THIS CRAP,This CD sucks. its worse than fungus amongus if someone gave it to me i wouldnt take it
1,Stupid,"I loved Incubus,but now they suck. THere music is a lot different now. And why do all the rock bands think its cool to be Anti Bush? Its dumb. I dont like it when rock bands express their political views, it gets annoying"
2,BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNGGG!!,"Let me start this off by saying that I am a fan of the older Incubus. I think that S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Fungus Amongus are phenomenal albums. Since the first two albums, I believe that they have been going down hill. Again, I like the raw, heavier stuff. When I heard Megalomaniac for the first time I became really excited and could not wait to hear the rest of the album and let me tell you, to say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. Now, I have listened to it from start to finish about four times, so I really haven't fully absorbed it yet, we will see if it grows on me with time.If you like the older Incubus, I don't know if you will like A Crow Left of the Murder, if you like the newer stuff, Morning View, Make Yourself, you will probably love this Disc. This is my humble opinion."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"Incubus has made 2 of my favorite cd's of all time: Make Yourself and Morning View. They were so catchy and interesting. Everything about the those cd's was top-notch. When I heard that their new cd was coming out soon, I was really excited. I just new that Incubus was going to keep getting better. OH MAN WAS I WRONG. This cd absolutely sucks. There is only one song that sounds anything like their old songs and that is Megalomaniac. The rest of the cd is soooooo boring and uninteresting. The songs do not have any of the great hooks that their old cds had. This is by far their softest cd too. Their is hardly any distortion on the whole cd. There is waaaayyyy too many strange sound effects, also. It sounds like they tried way too hard to sound different. I hope they can return to greatness."
2,Oh I was expecting so much more...,"It's almost like they're regressing back to their more hardrock days, which may be great for 13-year-olds who want to rebel against their parents, but not for me.At times, Brandon sounds like he wants to be the next Zack de la Rocha (from Rage) but he's definitely missing the mark.Plus a little thing that bugged me is that the song titles are ridiculously stupid. Normally that's a non-issue but these seem to be really dumbed down.This feels like they're just making the album for the sake of making it. Sounds like they're not trying to expand their sound at all; if anything it's shrunken. It's just not so good; all-around disappointment."
1,Megalosuck-it and other stuff a 4 year old could do better,This album is one of the worst things I've ever heard. I'd DEFINITELY give it 0 stars if that was a choice. Maybe I should drop out of college too and learn to be a sell out. To anyone who hasn't bought the ablum yet: don't buy it!!! It's not even worth wasting a CD-R over.
4,When Incubus attacks....again and again,"Incubus is back with a new polished sound on Crow... Every song on this cd is a masterpiece. Fans of early incubus may not like the new sound, but for fans of make yourself and morning view, you will love it. The top 3 songs...1 meglomaniac 2 southern girl 3 talk show on mute"
2,Maybe their next one will make up for this one!,"Incubus, Incubus! What have you done? You have been one of my favorite bands for years. This latest album is weak at best. They must have been hanging out with Bono during this albums inception. Man, I'm sick of rock groups that try to throw their political views on us, via video and or songs. I am really unhappy with this album, you guys are better than this. It's just so depressing. Where are the strong sounds we are use to? Let's hope they can regain some of their older sound for the next album."
2,"Nice to look at, but....","only for a little while! As soon as we got her out of the box (and that took some patience!) she had issues. It doesnt colour change, unless you put an ice cube on her, and that gets old pretty fast. My daughter thought she was really pretty and wanted to sleep with her (we got the extra nightgown set too). Her hair got nappy that same night. She sure does look cute in the box, but that's about all the enjoyment we got out of her. My daughter put her in her toy box with all the rest of the stuff she never touches anymore."
1,sheesh--there goes a wasted afternoon,"This guy should be writing essays, not poems. I don't read essays, so fortunately I would never have had to run into him. Can't even get the Wonder Twins right."
2,Love Poems We've Heard Before,"I don't claim to be a poetry expert. I guess I just know what I like. Something moves me or it doesn't. 17 Love Poems doesn't move me at all. It's not very original. We've read these love poems before. Okay, not word for word, but there's no new sentiment here or original feeling or imagery. I'd say Ward has nothing new to offer, at least judging by this collection of material. I respect the effort he put into it, but I'd say don't waste our time unless you've got something more original to say. These poems feel like something a roofer in Michigan could write if he put in a little effort. Again, not bad, but nothing special."
1,Modern and trite,"I have known that modern writing has become quite loose and poor lately, and this one just seals it for me. More self-involved poetry that really doesn't have to do with anybody else but the poet. Weak form, no sense of what is truly beautiful in language. This may be fine for the poet to amuse himself in his own little world, but I want something that looks like it has more effort behind it."
4,Young writing but good writing.,"Too often when poets write love poems,they bore me. Not so here. The energy Ward incorporates within the words give this book a synergy that is uncommon in modern love poetry. When I was given this book, I thought ""Great, another Rod McKuen or Susan Politz Schwartz,"" but I was wrong. This is only his second book, I think--I look forward to this voice ripening with age. I hope he can maintain this energy in his words."
1,terrible reception,"if you would like to be heard by the person you are talking to absolutely do not purchase this phone. It is terrible. It advertises 2.4ghz technology, however my 900hz phone works 10x's better. even if you increase the volume the caller can hear you as a whisper even if you are standing right next to the base. In addition, the answering machine is akward to use."
1,"Nice features, but I can't be heard","I bought this phone about 3 weeks ago for the answering machine and a second phone. I can't use the phone though, because no one can hear me when I talk...I am sending the phone back to the company and will never buy a NW Bell phone. Do not buy this phone!!!"
3,Great Phone; Horrible Answering Machine,The phone itself is a good phone for around the house but both the phone and answering machine have horrible volume and you must turn them all the way up just to hear what is being said.
5,great book,It is nice to read a book that doesn't spout the usual dribble. It sure makes history a lot more interesting
1,I found a huge mistake on the first page,"I was distressed to find a mistake on the very first page of the first chapter. Dr. Woods states that there wasn't diversity among the American colonists from 1629 to 1775. He writes that the immigrants ""came from one part of Europe and spoke a common language"". Then he describes four groups of immigrants from regions of England. However he leaves out the Dutch who settled in New York State in the early 1600s, the Swedes, and the Dutch and German Quakers as well as other religious sects from Germany who settled in PA. I'm appalled.Kenneth C. Davis author of Don't Know Much About History, Harper Collins, 2003, states that ""by 1640, at least eighteen languages were spoken in New York...""Dr. Woods needs to learn his facts! How can I trust that any of the rest of this book is true?"
2,Lacking,"The main problem I have with this book is that the author goes to great lengths to point the reader to specific books that support his point of view, yet can only say ""most textbooks"" or the like when describing what he believes it being taught in the schools. I'm not armed to say he's right or wrong in his painting of history, but this methodology leaves me quite skeptical."
4,A good starting point.,"This is a good quick summary of American history. I was hoping for a more detailed thesis. It seems at times that the opinions of the writer is presented as fact. A few times, I think he should have refrained from saying stuff like ""As one historian has said..."" Ugh, just say who the historian is. Also there are no notes showing exactly where he got some of his information. So James Bovard this guy is not.But overall in spite of it's flaws, it's still a decent book. I especially enjoyed a quote from Franklin Roosevelt complaining that the Supreme Court would let farmers plant whatever they want on their land, as if they owned it. Also the chapter on how Wilson forced the US in to a World War for his own glory is excellent.If you're interested in getting a fresh point of view of American history, this is a good starting point. There are more detailed books out there to check out, but this one is still good, if a bit incomplete."
3,Politically incorrect Guide to American History,"It is ok, but it really is nothing to write home about so to speak. This just did not meet my expectations as a good book should. I was not overly impressed by the content."
1,A Rare Value,"Not only is Woods' book politically incorrect, it is also factually incorrect! That is two big, wrong, books for the price of one."
1,I wish I had liked it more,"I heard great things about this book from all my friends, and I normally love this sort of thing that buries lefty myths and takes a hardline approach to our history. But I didn't like this book very much at all. Mostly because it just reiterated the things we all know and believe about American History, instead of contributing to explaining problems with what we believe. I was very troubled once when I made the same point Woods make about the US having a common heritage to a friend from the North, and he pointed out that in southern schools people are taught that the early history of the US was about Jamestown, and that in the North they're taught about Plymouth. Not the same religion, and in fact a civil war happened about that in England. PLus, slavery's too absent in this book. All in all it makes it less convincing than it should have been. If you read, read it carefully."
1,Conservative revisionist history,"Pure political dogma, a must read for the fascist leaning neo conservative. Ironically, it's normally a conservative rallying cry of revisionist history, but apparently it doesn't count as long as your only disparaging history that could be construed as liberal.Google up some reviews from conservative historians and see what they think. Just make sure they are actual historians, and not assistant professors at a community college."
2,way less than expected in every dimension,"I expected some historical facts, what I got is mostly an extreme Liberatarian interpretation of historical facts I already know."
4,Basic overview of American History,"One of the earliest of the PIG books in the series, Mr. Woods lays out a basic framework for a fresh perspective in American History. This short 243-page ride takes us from the colonial origins of our nation's history to the close of the Clinton years. I found it highly readable, but I must deduct a star because I wished that he would have had endnotes to complement his statements, but in all fairness he does include endnotes in his later books. In terms of raw history the facts and figures were pretty accurate with a small exception stating that former New Jersey senator Harrison Williams was a Republican when in reality he was a Democrat who met an ignominious end in the early 1980s.Mr. Woods basic survey does contain a bibliography that directs readers to books that expand on the points that he made in this guide. A job well done."
2,history from a warped Republican perspective,"I bought this book with the hope that I would learn something new, insightful and unbiased about American history. While it is definitely different from your traditional history texts, it is definitely biased.Example: It bashes Clinton over Somalia, but gives no mention to the wars fought by the 2 Bushes and Reagan.Reagan gets huge credit for how great the economy was under him, but Clinton gets nothing even though the 90's were good too.FDR gets bashed for dragging us into WW2 (hello, Hitler???), but there is no mention whatsoever about Vietnam or Korea.My problem with this book is that there are is one thing here and one thing there that I find holes with and pretty soon I can't believe anything he says.I did give it two stars because it at least made me think and not believe everything I read (especially if he wrote it)."
1,Contorted facts,"Numerous mistakes and contortions are already pointed out in previous reviews; I'll add one I have seen yet. Woods refers to the 3/5ths stipulation for slaves as a generous compromise by Southerners at the Constitutional convention since they were giving up significant representation in national elections. If slaves had counted as a full person, Woods argues, the South would have had the advantage of more votes in national elections. Whoa! So Woods is giving the white slave owners the benefit of actually allowing the blacks to vote at all... and I suppose these slaves would also vote to continue slavery? Quite a stretch.The entire book is a collection of ass-hat arguments justifying all manner of right wing peccadilloes: prayer in schools, unlimited gun rights, states' rights toward slavery, etc. He implies that the South treated blacks more humanely than the North among other things. I only got through the first couple chapters and had to put it down or my brain would melt."
1,Too bad there is no way to do negative stars,"This book is so biased I will not even put it in our library donation box! I wish I had read some reviews before I purchased it. I was looking forward to some interesting facts, but found out too late that this is just a diatribe for the adherents of the far right."
1,Factually Incorrect,"Woods makes plenty of factual egregious errors. For instance, he does not discuss the ""acquisition"" of Indian land outside New England, or Massachussett's expulsion of Roger Williams for treating Indians with respect.He omits any mention of Confederate atrocities during the Civil War, such as the massacre of black POWs by Nathan Bedford Forrest, or the CSA order to execute any officer in command of black troops. Nor is there any mention of Reconstruction violence and the systematic disenfranchisement of former slaves.I could go on and on... though there were excellent parts I enjoyed (such as trust busting), the overall presentation made me very skeptical.As an attorney, I can definitively state that his (highly selective) quotes and allusions to Supreme Court cases, and the Fourteenth Amendment are misleading and distorting to the point of being fiction."
1,Politics isn't the problem; half-assedness is,"I take the title from one of my former students, who offered the term as an apology for work that wasn't up to standards. This isn't either.Woods can make people happy by spouting cant, but it isn't history. I don't mind the cartoon conclusions. I do mind leaving most of the evidence out. Incidentally, citing other writers whose ideas are cribbed is also a nice idea."
4,a necessary corrective,"Books like this one need as wide a circulation as they can get. But the readers who need them most are students, not only college students but especially high school students. One wonders if this book will get to them. Perhaps if their parents buy it and leave it lying around. Besides merely correcting the lies of well-meaning but misguided academics, though, we need to understand why they are putting out these lies about American history. What is going on behind the scenes in history departments and how did these people get so much power in the first place? Simple guesses won't do. You need to read other books to find this out. Maybe understanding them will help to fight them. Simple demonizing won't do either. A lot of fellow travelers are going along because they're terrified of their jobs and would split from these people if they could. They teach the ""party line"" (if I may call it that) because they're scared."
2,If You Listen To The Way Tommy Tells It...,The Confederacy were a great bunch of gents who were more freedom-loving than Honest Abe & his band of Republicans.Need I say more?
1,Less Than Zero,"Uninformed propaganda with intellectual dishonesty, or stated in a politically incorrect way, this book is just a bunch of stupid lies."
3,Right-Wing Propagandist Book,"This book is, just what many others reviewers have stated, right-wing selective history. I am not a lib\conservative or a capitalist of any type. I do like this book for what itis, a study of the propaganda used by one side of American politics. I would recommend this book for anyone studyingpropaganda in general and has an interest in American politics.However, do not buy this book as a source of historical facts...it is far too one-sided."
1,Dogma not History,"I bought this after seeing the author lecture on BookTv. He came across as credible then, but his book reads as one side of a Crossfire argument. Though some of his claims may be legitimate, e.g. the ascendancy and abuses of federalism, this cherry-picked approach to history could be challenged by most any informed historian.Further evidence that this is more a mass marketing endeavor than serious history is the appropriated-ly familiar easy-reading format. Professor Woods, if you want to make a persuasive argument, write a real book, not Revisionism for Dummies!Academically inclined, avoid; Fox News devotees, enjoy!"
1,The Politically Correct Guide to American History,"How is this book in any shape or fashion ""Politically Incorrect""? This is filled with the same politically motivated drivel I was force-fed in school. This is a book that simply panders to Right-wing concerns and should be retitled in order to comply with Truth in Marketing rules.If you want to find a real Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, pick up Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States : 1492-Present."""
1,Stinker,"I am a Conservative, but this is simply screed. Poorly written, poorly researched, sort of a ""crybaby"" book, simply repeating well known but very outdated.Example: Southern treatment of black Americans post Civil War was much better than in North."
3,who makes a good witness,"two people see the same event and give two similar and often distinct interpretations based on perception, prejudice, experience and very often with desire for an acceptable outcome. Also known as rationalizing. Mr. Woods sees history from a perspective different from those who were on the receiving end of the events he determines an acceptable and in his account, ""accurate"" interpretation to. It is a good thing to have varying opinions, so I encourage readers to get the other side of the story; as P. Harvey would say, before touting this books conclusions as fact. RN"
2,Less than honest,"While I appreciated the readability of the book, in the end I found it frequently annoying due to the author's:* Constant use of half-truths and unsubstantiated claims.* Frequent ""anything government does is bad"" commentary.* Highly selective account of history to support the author's political agenda.On the plus side, certain aspects of my understanding of history were challenged. However, I have a hard time taking the author's writing as ""gospel"" due to his approach.I suspect libertarians & conservatives will generally love the book, while liberals won't."
1,Correcting History,"Reviewer Jon Swift Wrote:I prefer history that is correct, January 17, 2006I have not actually read this book but I don't understand why someone would write a book of history that is incorrect. I think we have enough problems nowadays getting young people to learn the correct dates when something happened and the correct names of our Presidents that filling their heads with more incorrect information doesn't make any sense at all.Thomas E. Woods Jr.'s Response after having the review censored:17 Jan 2006 22:36:59 -0800Do you not understand the term ""politically incorrect""?? It doesn't mean FACTUALLY incorrect. Have you never heard of political correctness? And you're going to denounce a book you've never read on the basis of your own ignorance? What's the matter with you?"
5,Great book,"I am a big fan of Tom Woods, and this book certainly does not disappoint. I definitely recommend it if you want to learn real history instead of the BS we were taught in school."
2,American History,"The title of the book suggests a far more incisive commentary than is presented. The reader is informed, but yet will be disappointed that many of the well-known atrocities to the Constitution have been ignored or reviewed in very moderate--politically correct--terms. Either a greater concentration on pre-20th Century history would have been preferable or the book should have dealt with events solely in the 20th Century, which some would consider to be modern times rather than history. Overall, not bad, but not particularly good for a reader reared and educated outside this country trying to obtain an unbiased understanding of what happened here in days gone by."
1,Attacking Bias with Bias,"The back cover says ""Everything (well, almost everything) you know about American history is wrong, because most textbooks and popular history books are written by left-wing academic historians who treat their biases as fact.""What is unfortunate about this book is that the author treats his own right-wing bias as fact. Which is too bad - a book that used real scholarship to debunk some of the politically correct mythmaking around historical events would have been great. This, however, is not that book."
1,Totally Biased Garbage,"This so-called ""history"" would be laughable if it wasn't so obnoxiously biased. It's nothing but a fantasy revision of American history for Rush Limbaugh fans and other rightwing types who let their politics prejudice their history. Full of factual errors and one-sided arguments, this book is complete garbage."
2,Full of glaring omissions,"As a staunch conservative, I gave this book a try. It does contain some very good information that most textbooks leave out. However this is all overshadowed by several glaring omissions.Glaring Omission #1: Andersonville. In Dr. Woods rush to blame the entire Civil War on the evil North while make South out to be saint like. He even makes the claim that Robert E. Lee was able for the most part to keep the Confederate Army within the boundaries of the civilized laws of war. Dr. Woods seems to forget the Andersonville prison camp and other Southern atrocities while making sure to mention Northern ones.Glaring Omission #2: The Zimmerman Telegram. In Dr. Woods's zeal to blame all of World War I on Woodrow Wilson, he forgets to even mention the Zimmerman Telegram.Another claim that is dubious at best: FDR's refusal to meet with the `moderate' Japanese Prime Minister led to the fall of the moderates and rise of militarism. I guess invading China is `moderate' to Dr. Woods."
2,Not a Resource,"I have to agree with those who were excited upon hearing of this book's publication but were disappointed with the reality. No footnotes or references are provided for the many claims made (though there is a bibliography). Consequently, few of the points made can be taken seriously - they may be true or they may just be Dr. Woods' opinion. A college professor should be ashamed to publish such a work.If you're conservative this book will do for a quick, entertaining read. However, if you're interested in knowledge and intellectual ammunition, this is not your book."
1,Get a Real History Book Instead,"This book is fine if you want to read fiction. Or if you prefer history written by a white supremacist. Otherwise, get a history book that attempts to tell the whole story. Ignorance of our history has crippled the nation's conscience and courage."
1,Fight propaganda with propaganda?,"How does writing a biased right-wing version of history make up for the so-called ""left-wing bias"" of modern textbooks? Thomas E. Woods Jr hardly tries to detail a factual version of history. He merely tries to fight supposed propaganda with more unapologetic propaganda. This book is nothing more than a novelty item."
3,Mediocre,"I was somewhat disappointed after reading this selection. The book contains much more slanted propaganda than factual information. Despite the fact that I tend to be politically incorrect, I would like to see history presented as a system of factual information from which I can draw my own conclusions and formulate my own opinions. This text is geared to manipulating the reader into accepting the authors opinion, solely."
5,Politically Incorrect Guide to American History,This is honesty at its best. This is what needs to be taught in schools.
1,Malevolent or just Foolish?,"This book is proof that intelligence and education can be a mask for, at best, a fool, or more insidiously, a propaganist.This book uses argument in the guise of facts, interpretation as data and discredits, without honest examination, any inconvenient argument that might disagree with the author's predetermined agenda. What is that agenda? To re-write history to fit the political rhetoric so commonly use by right-wing radio and TV mouthpieces.This is not history. It is a version of the same sort of tripe that spills out of the mouths of demagogues like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh thinly veiled in the guise of reasonable interpretation of fact.Don't be fooled. It is not ""politically"" incorrect. It is just incorrect."
2,I thought better,"I'm Italian and then I've had some difficuties to follow the ""line"" of the story.A little dispersive"
4,Great but a little wordy,"I really enjoyed reading this book, but I found the author's writing style to be slightly awkward and wordy. I have to admit that I picked up the book with a very conservative mindset, so I agreed with much of the book. I was not surprised much by any of the subjects, and found a lot of things that I already knew. This may not seem like a big deal, but I consider myself to be a little ignorant when it comes to history, and I expected to learn more than I did. I also think that American history has the potential to be very funny (sarcastic,) but the author did not seem to exploit this.I think that I have experienced a situation where this book really did not edify me. I can imagine that it would do a lot of good to force congress to read it."
1,A Thoroughly Dishonest Book,"To fact-check this book, I turned to page 242 and the American intervention in the Balkins. According to the author, there were no mass graves!To its credit, the rest of the book is a more clever in its dishonesty. Like the delightful picture of the Confederate warrior on its cover, its greatest value is in revealing the specious reasoning of radical conservatives. One could easily mistake it for a parody"
3,"Pretty good start, but...","Woods' analysis of history before WWII was excellent and an enjoyable twist on what we might normally hear. However, moving into more modern history, especially the last 35 years, it became evident that this was less analysis and much more opinionated, reducing one's trust in the objectivity of the writer. When I read a history text, I either want unbiased objectivity or I want to hear both sides. This text gave neither, especially in the final sections."
1,A whining list of half-truths and lack of context,"My patience wore thin after the first few chapters, but I read on in horrified fascination. This book does exactly what it criticizes -- gives factoids in isolation and ""forgets"" anything which may complicate the situation. For instance, he dismisses the entire Civil Rights Act on the basis that it did not improve the social or economic standing of African Americans. This is a fair subject for discussion. But not even a begrudging acknowledgment of the fact that most restaurants, hotels and sports venues had been able to exclude or marginalize African Americans for years with no penalty? And, just as I feared, he was preaching to the choir. Most of the reviews here are written by people who blindly accept Tom Woods' theses with no question, no need to read primary resources and no real knowledge of American history."
1,The Politically Incorrect Guide To American History,"I'll start out by saying I'm a retired, life-long Republican with a strong interest in catching up on American history. My critique will be short and sweet. If Thomas E. Woods, Jr, Ph.D. actually earned his Ph.D. in American History, this book casts serious doubt on the education process that granted that degree. His ""Politically Incorrect Guide..."" is a cynical and grotesquely distorted rendition of American history indeed, starting with page one. It would be far to laborious to catalog the obviously willful distortions in this book. Suffice it to say that unless you are a.) an extremist right-wing ideologue afflicted with Alzheimers, or b.) in need of a half-inch shim under your reading table leg, there is absolutely no reason to posess this book. Having read it, I must now reassess my opinion of the New York Times Best Seller List.Seabury LyonBethel, Maine"
3,Couldn't believe I passed,"After studying for the social science exam using ONLY this book I set out and took the exam. I left feeling totally unprepared and convinced that I had failed. I made a 510, so I can't down the book too much, however I do not feel that I was well prepared. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day."
3,Okay for what you pay for it...,"Passed the clep exam with a 510 using only this book. There are plenty of items on the test not covered in the book, so be careful!"
1,not whats pictured...,"If you want a regular color blue, then get these. i wanted the color pictured (which is more of a neon blue) for a specific purpose."
1,Lots Of Features - Atrocious Sound Quality,"When I use this phone, the response I get from people on the other end is huh? huh? What did you say?At first I thought it was a bad connection. Then I thought maybe the listener had a hearing problem, but it's the same with everyone you talk to. In addition, it's difficult to hear on this phone if the person doesn't have a low and loud voice.It's hard to imagine that AT&T doesn't have some sort of quality control system in place that would catch this and that they would actually go into production with it."
2,Decent phone- bad display,"I've owned this model for almost two years now. The receiver works fine- reception isn't a problem. However, as others have written, the digital display started going out after only a year. It has gotten progressively worse. At this point, the caller id is completely useless- can't even guess at what the number is since just about NOTHING shows up.Another problem I experience is if the phone rings and I don't get to it in time and the answering machine clicks on, upon picking up the receiver, the answering machine doesn't cut off. Every other answering machine I've ever seen will cut off and the call will be connected."
1,Not pleased with this product,"Everything worked fine for a few months, then it became difficult to hear the other party on this phone. Soon after that the Caller ID information became garbled then nonexistent. Shortly thereafter the phone stopped working completely. I thought it was the battery but when I purchased another one it still doesn't work."
1,Headset woes -- steer clear,"I have had two of these within the last year. Functionally and in terms of sound quality, they have been fine -- but both went wacky. The first stopped working unless I used a headset; the headset jack on the second stopped working. I'm ready to try another brand."
2,Started giving problems within a year,"I too faced similar problems. Within a year, the display went bad and now nothing is visible on the LCD. Does anybody know what the problem is? Does it mean, that we need to throw off this phone?"
2,year and a half later,"The sound quality is only acceptable. Most people on the receiving end say I sound very far away. Many of the phone base features are not set up in an obvious way. They almost require the manual. That's OK, but why not just make them easy to use?NowThe display is going out. It started about two months ago with a small amount of failure and has become progressively worse. Now I have to guess at what the display says."
2,1 week and the thing is useless!,"I bought this phone and one week later the volume gave out. Now you can barely hear the person on the other line. Plus it takes too long to connect. The answering machine does work though, although you have to go through a lot to set the clock time."
2,BAD IDEA,I was very disappointed with this telephone. I purchased the phone and within two months the phone just stopped working. The answering machine still works. A friend of mine purchased an identical product and had the same outcome. I would not recommend anyone to purchase the AT&T 900MHZ Cordless Telephone.
2,at&t 9357 900 mhz cardless phone,phone work great donot no instruction on how to used it the red light blinking sence it was plug in
3,Not my first choice for a basic book,"Very politically correct, and thus helpful if you plan on speaking to a cross-cultural audience. I had it for an introductory public-speaking college course (undergrad), and found it too heavy on PC and not heavy enough on basic public-speaking skills, an overall frustrating experience."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,"I wonder how this junk came to be listed at Amazon. The program installs spy-ware as well as other ad supported programs. Most importantly, Namo does not do its job. It is alot easier to build a website using Dreamweaver or Frontpage. Just dont buy this. If you are thinking about it, then go download the trial version of it and see if you still want it. This is a junk. The worst product I've ever bought at amazon."
2,Too Many Bugs,"I used version 5.5 of Web Editor and it was pretty good. But I've had nothing but problems with this version.*The typing sometimes won't wordwrap - for reasons I can't figure out.*The words will scrunch together for unknown reasons. For instance, ""I am happy"" will appear as ""Iamhappy"". Fix it, and the problem comes back -- more bugs.*The spell checker won't spot all the mispelled words.* Publishing to the site is uneven. On some sites it works fine, while on others it won't let you view the files on the web host (haven't the faintest idea why.)Using this program was such a royal pain, I finally gave up and switched to FUSION 8 - FUSION worked like a charm."
1,Namo WebEditor 6 Suite,"I purchased this software after reading fairly positive reviews. I have little experience with web page design so this looked like the right fit. Well, it's easy enough to use for the most part but forget it if you have a problem with the software. The customer service is non-existent. You can't call because their offices are in Korea and I am also unable to connect to their customer service to ask a question via email. I can not get the software to work and I can't use it. If you are considering this software, better think twice and buy something that has some support -- this is a huge waste of money."
2,Agree with other reviewers - poor support & buggy,"I agree with most of the other negative reviewers. Despite the high praise and many features in this web editor I have had nothing but frustrations with it. The registration did not work and a question I sent to the company was never answered. What is most frustrating is that many things work in unexpected ways. And other functions have a mind of their own - for example, I set a table column width in NAMO but when I look at it online its different. I simply can not make tables work right. Even though I'm a 20 plus years computer user, I've had to hire a programmer to help use this user-friendly tool! I like the price and the features - too bad I can't make it work. I end most sessions saying, I hate this program!"
1,"Good features, but VERY slow and many bugs!","The software is EXTREMELY buggy! 5.5 is much better, but buggy just the same. This version (and the ones after it) run very slow on every machine I've ever owned. I recently tested this on a dual core intel CPU with 8 gig of ram and SSD's and it was still very sluggish. Worse yet, when you turn on the FTP feature to upload, if you have a large directory to upload from, it will take over 60 seconds to be ready. Then after you upload you need to turn it off, or every page you load and work on will crawl to the screen very slowly. Problem is, when you turn off the ftp feature the software crashes over 80% of the time.In short, don't waste your money! You WILL regret it! As for customer service? I have a few emails out there waiting for them to respond. They haven't done so in literally months.PS.. I trialed 9.0 recently.. not much improvement.. deleted it."
2,Namo Web software,"Guys,This software does create web sites easily but its frustrating when the software crashes all the time. Banners and logos are very limited and Namo offers no update service. I was able to create a web site but controlling the layers in the editor was very difficult since the product kept on crashing. Pay a few more $$ and get some decent software.Hope this helps.Horsefly"
1,Bogus Reviews - Be Careful,I have some serious concerns that some of the reviews for the Web Editor 6 Suite were written by people that have something to gain from the product being highly rated. The 4 reviews from Mass.(Boston and Brighton) were done on Aug 10 (3 of them were) and July 28 (1 of them).I think that the consensus from people that don't work for the company (which is based in Korea with an office in California) is that support is almost nonexistant and good luck getting a refund. It is probably better to just dispute the charge with the credit card company.I will have to scrutinize reviews more carefully before I buy a product based on them.
1,A Major Bug!,"Although it would be hard to match all of the ""extras"" you get with this program, I found a major problem that makes it impossible to use. The program puts in non-breaking spaces for regular spaces between words in table layouts which explodes the table beyond all margins. I'm not the only one that has complained about this (and the company has acknowledged the problem) but so far no upgrade fix. Until they address this problem (which would seem simple to fix) I wouldn't recommend this program. This problem was not evident in previous versions, all of which I've used and liked."
1,Don't bother with this,"Actually, this should be 0 stars!I bought the product, partially based on the excellent reviews. Whe I tried to register it on-line, as they require, it wouldn't accept the product code because it was ""incorrect"". Since I was looking at it, that didn't make any sense. Then I tried to find a way to contact them. Would you believe it - there was NO WAY on any of their pages. I finally sent an annoyed e-mail to someone, but am looking for another program with accessible support. There always comes a time when support is required."
1,Too bad,The board arrived packaged nicely. The board itself is beautiful. Unfortunately it is warped and not usable. Sending it back.Update: I received a replacement and it was not warped. Yeah! But the board wasn't sanded well. I spent about a half hour finishing it off.
1,The 2 Vol is the replicate of the 4 vol bundle!!!,"I bought the 2 vol set with the 4 vol bundle with the thought that the 2 vol set is totally different. How wrong i am!!! It is exactly the duplicate of the 4 volume, the only difference is that the study outline and problems and solutions in the 4 vol set had been split into 2 volumes.I have returned the 2 vol set to Amazon.Hopefully can get a refund."
4,Titties-Titties EVERY WHERE,"This double feature stars an assortment of hot, sexy women, getting their freak on. There's brief girl on girl, & much girl on guy, & girl on girl on girl. This is an excellent soft-core porn, featuring BIG [...] women"
4,awesome,all the women on this dvd are hot no lie alot sex scenes its an awesome softcore porn movie both them that is.
4,Great movie and free!,"First, I couldn't complain about this movie even if I wanted too. It was free! This is a great flick. Not scary, but what is nowadays. Just look at the cover. You can tell it's scary. The women are hot. The movie did need some blood. But other than that. Thumbs up!"
2,Welcome to Silicon valley,"IF you like artificially enhanced ladies, this is your movie. Lots of soft-core sex which may stimulate some but leave others wondering why they bought these 2 films to begin with. The plot is nothing more than a means to get to the next sex scene.recommended to: Fans of soft-core sex (both boy-girl and girl-girl) and those who like to look at large breasts."
1,Witches of Wastewick,This movie was not worth the cost to return it. DO NOT waste your money.They completely waste the talents of Monique Parent. the hot tub scene must have been filled with ice cold water. This movie could not heat up a 14 year old virgin. If you like giant fake breasts then okay. better yet spend your money on fake lotto tickets at least those are SUPPOSED to be funny. By far the worst movie with the least stimulating sex imaginable. Don't complain if you ignore this warning.
4,Nice Soft Porn,"Visually stunning, little plot but who cares? The women are are a nice distraction from the hard core knocks of the real world. Worth mentioning is the raven haired beauty Taimie Hannum a former playboy model that looks exactly like a Doctor's daughter & cheerleader I knew in high school. Wow! I'm bewitched!"
1,Implants 'R' Us,"I suppose one could overlook the wretched acting in this alleged spoof of ""The Witches of Eastwick"", and forgive the frequent and unexplained mood shifts of the main characters, and instead just look at the almost constant nudity of the female characters.Problem is, you can't, or at least I can't. The three ""Witches"" are the victims of the most appallingly botched implant jobs in the history of science. Combine that with the way they stare blankly at the camera during their ""lust"", with the female equivalent of a post-lobotomy Randall P. McMurphy look on their faces, and you'll be wishing you had the wasted hour and a half back someday when you're on your death bed."
1,Scratched,"The dvd is scratch and it hardly plays. Apparantley if you sell a product, it should work. Not everything is 100 percent, but it should be in good condition."
3,Cinderella color changing doll,"My 3 year old twins each received this doll and were very disappointed when we applied the cold water and there was no color change. The other problem is that the satiny shoes keep falling off. They love playing with the doll because it is a princess but are disappointed the nails, face, bracelet did not appear to change color."
5,"Super Mala FE llego ""A Lo Oscuro""","Mala FE's second album is just pure craziness. Starting with ""A lo Oscuro"", the album shows that Mala Fe put time into this album. Another song rocking for a moment now is ""Haciendo Cocote"". I'm laughing just by writing the title. Overall, if you got the first album and thought it was awesome, this one's out of here!! ""No Hagas Cocote que esta vaina ta Pega""!!!!"
5,Excellent masterwork!,This book should be the basis for all further research in the area of music therapy. I have sincerely never read a better work than this one on music therapy. Excellent theoretical background information and well-explained.
3,"Good, but not idea for me","I understand why someone else would find these glasses very comfortable. They are well made, good attention to detail and the convert from glasses to goggles to glasses option is nice.However they didn't really fit me right, so I got residual wind in my eyes while riding my motorcycle and the bridge of my nose got sore after a while. Not a bid deal, the shape of my head just doesn't work too well with these glasses.Also, the photochromatic aspect didn't work as well as I hoped. I don't know if they need more exposure to the sun (i.e. over time) but after several hours of riding in the summer mid-day sun, they were barely tinted.Again good product, but I will stick with my other pair from the same manufacturer. They fit me better."
2,"cute, but not the best!","This costume looks very cute, but I am disappointed with it for several reasons: the size is definitely more for a size 2 to 4, definitely not a 5 or 6. My daughter is just moving out of size 4, and this dress already looks too small for her. The sleeves are made of a scratchy material which she doesn't like. This dress is also not washable...I would rather get something she will love and wear over and over...[...]"
4,Turned a little girl into a little princess....,"Perhaps the little girl is what makes the difference, but she and the dress were beautiful...."
1,Item Not As Described,"Hi all,I have purchased brand new ""Bosch 09346 Premium Spark Plug Wire Set"" but received not working item.I'm very disappointed"
5,Very softening c:,"This conditioner is very softening, and works amazingly. It works even better when you leave it in for 5-10 minutes, ( With I do with every conditioner). If your hairs breaking and damaged I would recommend this. I have thick normal to dry hair, and this has turn it in to luscious waves. I cant safe enough good things about this product C: Would recommend it to anybody."
4,That's all I use!,"It's an excellent product! But don't expect miracles! I have very curly, thick hair and it's damaged even though I never use any kind of irons and I use the hair dryer just for one minute or two to dry it. It's the only conditioner that makes my hair manageable. I tried other conditioners, but it seems it's the only one that fits my hair.I don't like the bottle though. It's very tough to squeeze. I tried the small container too and it's the same."
1,Totally messed up shipping!,The seller messed up the shipping of this item and sent me TWO shampoos. I can't return or exchange because the shipping to too much.(I love the product and wish I had it!!:-(
3,so soft,"my sister turned me on to this - really does leave hair so soft! moving to all organic products though, so this is my last bottle."
4,like this,I love using this redken all soft. i have oily hair and it's been the only thing that balances that out.
3,Redken All Soft Conditioner,"Bought this by mistake, wanted the shampoo; so I gave it to my niece. I love the Redken All Soft Shampoo!"
1,Made my hair dry and frizzy,"I read the positive reviews, and unfortunately I believe they refer to an older, better formula. This conditioner made my hair very frizzy after I used it, and also incredibly dry and more prone to breakage. I only used it a handful of times before abandoning it because it was wrecking my hair, and $4 Garnier conditioner works better for my hair (very long, thick, wavy). It was a disappointing experience overall."
1,NEW FORMULA HORRIBLE,"Old stuff was awesome, new not so good. Leave hair brittle and frizzy. I have been using this stuff for 4 years and will no longer be with redken. HORRIBLE REFORMULATION!!!"
1,Don't like the new formula,"I agree with the newer reviews of this product. I'd used this stuff for years. Hadn't bought it for awhile, as I'd stocked up on a few bottles at home, and had also temporarily used a different brand. I was looking forward to using All Soft again - and was unpleasantly surprised at the new formula. The old formula was very thick in consistency, whick I liked, and really did a good job on my hair. The new formula is thin, seems runny in comparison, and is not effective. Don't buy this product! I will be looking for a different brand."
3,Not exactly Mac compatible,"It's a great drive, and you can install it in a mac or pc, BUT the usb enclosure does not work with a mac. nor will you be able to use the included software to copy your old file on a mac. I've used this on a pc, it works great. But mac users better know what they're doing, and really shouldn't buy this because the only thing you can use in the package is the drive. Might as well just buy an OEM hard drive cheaper."
4,Martial Arts Reader for the Christian,"Robert Bussey has spent years in martial arts before finding Christ. In his book he gives an incredible look at martial arts from a Christian perspective. In this book he demonstrates his discoveries and exposes the fallacies he feels were within the martial arts. As another reviewer stated, This is a must for any Christian martial artist."
2,Disappointed in Catalina y Sebastian,I'm sorry I purchase the 3 spanish DVD. The story is so chopped up that it's difficult to follow. I won't make that mistake again.
1,Is a 3 disc novela and I got disc 1 and disc 3 (duplicate) no disc 2!!!!,"Come onnnnnnn!!!!I'm really disapointed I just got disc 1 and the disc three is duplicated, I just saw the beginning and the end, the middle of the novela??? no idea because I have a duplicate disc, what can I do????"
1,The very best of chinese quality!!!!!!!!!,"The seller could not choose worst quality fabric to assembly this backpack.It is just a piece of plastic with some laces pending .DO NOT WAISTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM, DO NOT BUY IT."
2,Do not buy this bag,"I bought this bag for school, and one week after the return date, the straps break. Can't return it. I'm stuck with it. I didn't abuse it. I didn't load it with rocks and go mountain rucking. Just normal wear and tear of a student walking to school with my books in the bag. Weak product. Would advise spending your money on a higher level product."
2,Bad taste spoils a good movie,"Within the first 10 minutes, Prince Charming had gone to bed with one young girl he had just met the night before, then was having sex with another he had just met mere SECONDS before! Reviewer David Birley clearly has no clue what he's talking about when he says ""no 7 year old would ever ""get"" what was ""going on"" because of the extremely (and delightfully) clever way in which this was handled."" I watched it with my 7-year-old and was very uncomfortable. What's so clever about a woman practically bursting out of her top, then dropping her skirts to the floor to show her completely bare legs as the ""Prince"" hoists her up against the bell? Maybe my daughter is just smarter than his, but I think ANYONE could figure out that scene. And it's a shame because this was otherwise a good movie with great period costumes and overall pretty good acting. My advice to parents is to watch it yourself first, then decide. I guess that's what we have to do with everything nowadays."
1,Prince Charming -- not so much,"The reviews I read on Amazon led me to purchase this item, but I must say it was extremely disappointing to actually watch the DVD. The movie wasn't rated--I don't remember seeing that anywhere before I bought it for my daughter. We started to watch it on Christmas afternoon and had to turn it off because the content was so mature and just nasty. The characters are completely unlikeable and I wish I hadn't spent the money on such a waste of a DVD."
5,Utterly charming!,"What a great find! I have to give credit to Hallmark... They make some of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen (check out The Tenth Kingdom, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Cleopatra). Funny, witty, and just plain awesome! Oh, supporting characters Martin Short, Christina Applegate, and Bernadettte Peters did an especially good job."
5,Prince Charming is Charming,I have loved this movie since seeing it on TV. I have looked for it for the past several years and am so glad to see it here in DVD. It has a very heartwarming story line in a fractured fairytale format. It is enjoyable for all ages and of course Martin Short adds his unique style of humor to make this truly enjoyable. It would make a great family viewing buy.
2,Poor and boring film,"I saw many fearie tale becames movies, but tyhis one has no charme, no magic and makes you waste your time"
5,Neil Innes has no equal.,Neil Innes is a unique musician and song writer. He is among other things a very indidividual composer and this is just one of many cds he has produced. Listen to the words on some of these songs and if that doesn't convince you then begin with 'The Rutles - Archeology' which is a satire of the 'Beatles'. He has been producing cds for over forty years and he should be better known than he is.Highly recommended.
2,"bland, very bland","I can't think of too many people liking this comic. In my opinion, who ever created this made the story take a back seat. The cover suggests violence, a lot of it. No one loves comic book violence more then me, just as long as it makes sence. This trade paper back has maybe 5 pages of fighting at the very end (very disapointing) and the rest of the comic is a teeny bopper soap opera. I like the art style, and hope that in the future the artist of this sad comic might find a story worth telling."
2,Not original Shrade,"Though this knife looks and feels good, it is not authentic!The Schrade Company was located in Ellenville NY and all knives were manufactured at the Ellenville facility.The knife sold here is a Chinese replication. As I understand, after the Shrade Co. went out of business, collectors began to seek out the remaining stock of knives in circulation and the price of these knives increased accordingly.Be warned! This is not authentic Schrade!!!"
1,"Not good steel, not even a good price.","There are actually some really good Chinese knives available. Many have newer Chinese steel which is actually superior to the cheapest offerings from US brands.This knife is not one of those. I have sharpened mine several times, and it just doesn't hold up.What really stinks is that the price of these Chinese versions isn't much less than what the old US-made knives sold for. You hardly get any savings for buying a lower-quality knife manufactured with cheaper labor."
5,Schrade Muskrat knife,"My Grampa asked for this exact knife for Christmas saying that he's had the very same one for 5 years and that it's as sharp as the day he got it. Now, he's a farmer, and an outdoor guy, and a Mr. Fix-it so any pocket knife of his sees more action than most others. When I asked why he needed a second one I was told that it is such a good knife, he'd like to have one as a back up in case he ever loses his."
1,WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,"Take a look at this excerpt from this book:""Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a commission, a holy responsibility to reclaim the land for Jesus Christ - to have dominion in civil structures, just as in every other aspect of life and godliness.... World conquest. That's what Christ has commissioned us to accomplish.""This is what the ultra-psychotic, fundamentalist evangelicals are out for. They want to turn the U.S. into something the likes of which it has never seen: a high-tech Dark Ages. You owe it to yourself, to your fellow freedom / peace / civility loving citizens to do everything to STOP these power hungry, immoral hypocrites from going any further in their quest for theocracy. It isn't far-fetched at all. You do NOT want to see America ruled by religious law (do you?) It must be beaten back into the churches and callow minds from which it springs."
3,cute costume- runs really small,"everyone complimented my daughter in this costume- it was really cute! It ran small though- as in, it was almost too small for her at 10 months old. She is long, but she's skinny, so I would have thought it would be fine."
4,My girl looked cute,We had to hang the suit for several weeks and then steam it to get the creases out. The suit was as advertised.
2,not soo good!,it looked a bit different than the store photo and was so cheap. to poor of fabric for a toddler :(
4,Cute costume for the price,"This was a very cute costume. My 17 month old got lots of compliments while in it. The only thing I warn is that it runs small. My daughter is below average for height and weight and the costume was still quite snug. If your child is average or above average for their age, you would probably be better off getting the larger size."
3,Little Red,"I bought this costume for my 7 1/2 month old daughter for her first Halloween. It came on time and was really cute. However after trying it on her the first time the seams under the arms started coming apart. Wasn't a big deal since it was only going to be worn a couple of times, but would have liked for it to be a little more durable so I could put it in her keepsake chest, for when she gets older, without having to resew it. Overall it was a cute costume, just don't know how durable it would be for a 12-18 month old active child though."
2,This book is very easy to understand,I'm very impressed with this book. I have never cut or made anything out of glass. This book covers all the basics. It also has nice patterns to learn with.
5,Stained glass teacher suggests this as the best basic text.,"My husband and I just completed our first stained glass class. We visited several stained glass shops and dealers. No book was as good as this one. As a matter of fact, we first learned of it from our teacher, who confirmed that it is one of the best texts she purchased personally."
3,I Must Disagree,"While this book has some beautiful projects, it's SORELY lacking in details. If an absolute beginner were to rely exclusively upon this book for guidance, he/she would be up the proverbial creek.For example, on page 112 is a four panel lamp project. When I learned to make panel lamps, I not only had eight hours of classroom instruction, but also relied upon the book ""Sundown Lamps"" by Donna Eller for guidance. For this project, one is referred to pps 75-76, which contains five paragraphs of general instructions.I does provide an excellent description and photograph of commonly used tools.For the money, I'd opt to purchase ""The Complete Stained Glass Course"" by Lynette Wrigley and Marc Gerstein. Plus, there are some wonderful discussion boards on the web - and folks who are very generous with their time and advice. (Patient, too!!)"
3,"Nice photos, but...","Years ago I took a beginner's class at a local community college, then raising a family took my time. My tools and glass sat packed away for years, now the kids are grown and I am starting out as a beginner for a second time. Once again I am taking a class and wanted a book to supplement my learning and practicing at home. The photography is very striking, the best part of the book. Instructions are very basic. I am doing copper foil and hoped to find more tips on how to correct foiling mistakes. If I hadn't done some soldering, the instructions would have seemed very vague. I have read over the lead glass techniques, which I have not learned yet, and I am truly lost, can't make any sense of the directions. Consider this a bare bones introductory book, and once you become more proficient through other sources, perhaps return to it to recreate some of the patterns."
2,Book should sleep with the fishes.,"He recently went to the balance of the books action at the pearly gates. The line was not in his favor (gimme two). Don't know how it worked out but word on the street was some made guy made his acquaintance and a trip South was best for his health. His book should go there too. Pssst. Youse guys didnt hear nuttin from me bout nuttin, ya hear me."
2,Sleepaway Disappointing,"Outside of the quite funny Sedaris entry, the balance of the book features essays from people who clearly did not enjoy or appreciate (then or now) the camp experience. None of them explains what was so special about their experiences (positive or not) that they would choose to write about them 20+ years later. Surprisingly boring and smug."
3,Great gift,"This is a great gift for any tango lover, in this case my dad. He pretty much enjoyed it, good purchase."
4,Tango Bar,"I am a fan of Carlos Gardel, so I enjoyed this film very much. Naturally, being a very old movie, the quality was not what we are used to now, but the music compensated for it."
2,Misleading,"There was a great VHS movie called the Tango Bar (starring Raul Julia), in which there was lots of tango dancing. Don't be mistaken by this title. This movie is a musical starring Carlos Gardel."
5,The Era,"My husband is an ""old"" Brooklyn Dodger fan who loves everything Roger Kahn writes, so I thought this was the perfect Christmas gift...until he opened it and told me he had already read it!!! I was disappointed until he told me he had read it a couple of years ago and would read it again because he enjoyed it so much the first time. Christmas saved."
3,The Era,Parts of the book seem to ramble at times. Interesting reading from baseball fans that remember that era which I remembered the middle '50's
2,"5"" size not accurate","We received this filter and it barely is 4"" +- 1/8...definitely not 4 1/4"" or anything near to replacing our 5"" wide filter....deceptive advertising!!!!"
4,"beautiful photos, but skipped part of trail","The author took many photographs, which appear in the book and which are worth the price of the book by themselves. One quibble I have is that the author admits to skipping parts of the trail by hitchhiking, canoeing and taking a bus. For example, I looked for a description of the last part of the trail along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, but the book does not describe this part perhaps because the author skipped it by taking a bus. Most of this trail is road walking, so I do not blame the author. But in the interest of truth in advertising.... As other reviewers have noted, the author adeptly describes the people she met along the way."
3,El Libro para construir tu propia unidad mercenaria,Es un gran libro. Con él podrás hacer una unidad mercenaria y ponerle una clasificación basada en su tecnología y experiencia. También es útil en cuanto a la construcción de un contrato mercenario.Muy original. Pero para mi tiene un GRAN defecto(que me ha impedido concederle 4 estrellas): La más de la mitad del libro está dedicada a otras Lanzas mercenarias.Me parece un gran desperdicio.
4,"Ok, but...","All together, I see this book as a prety good one. The content that adds the the Battletech universe is exceptional. The Mercinary unit creation system however, could use some work. FASA needs to rember when making these books that everyone does not have the Technical Readouts. I for one will be buying the TR for the dropships and jumpships for this book. It is worth it."
5,It's legendary.,"For those who are going to read this book, you will find it to be much better than most of the other sourcebooks. It's got details on all the best mercenaries in the Inner Sphere and even allows you to create your own unit. It takes a wider view of the Sphere than the other sourcebooks and it gives a detailed history of the merc unit Wolf's Dragoons (though you can find it in the Dragoons sourcebook, if there is one). Anyway, if you are looking for Battletech info or just picking a sourcebook at random, the Mercs is the way to go."
4,Mike B,"This is exactly what I wanted and ordered. Once again, as usual you provided the item with zero problems. Thank you."
5,Iqbal,"Iqbal was a boy who had to work in a factory owned by a really mean ugly old guy who was really strict and didn't treat the kids well, more like slaves. Iqbal had to work there to pay off his parent's debt. He knew he would never get out of there, so he stood up for what he believed in. Iqbal inspired other kids to do the same as well. He got so famous that today it is illegal to have child laborers. It's really sad, but it's a really good book. :)"
5,Iqbal the story of an amazing boy,I just finished reading this book. It has to be one of the most inspirational and most wonderful books I have ever read. It shows courage and bravery and Iqbal himself is amazing. If you haven't read this book what are you waiting for? Pick it up!
4,powerful and lovely,"A beautifully written (especially for a young adult novel) story of Iqbal, a young slave to a carpet merchant and his fight for freedom and participation in the anti-child labor movement. Another must read for young adults, showing they have power in this world for good. Grade: A-"
3,kids reveiw,"The book Iqbal is about 16 children, Iqbal, Fatima, and 14others and a mean and evil guy named Husssain Khan. He sends them to all work in a carpet factory. They don't get to eat a lot so they starve, and never have a full stomach. This was a very exciting book and I recommend it to all."
3,Rise & Fall,"I finally finished it, his ultimate diagnosis is that English will either become a classical field in nature or will need to alter to embrace the present and the future. With Scholes specifics I disagree to some extent as he seems to want to turn undergraduate English into an advanced Intro to Communications course but I do agree that English (as well as most any liberal arts degree) need to alter. One idea of his I greatly enjoy is altering the LERs (liberal education requirements) to better fit a person's major than to just allow students to select randomly. Otherwise, fabulous book, not quite a page turned, and if you're not interested in English and literary theory I'd avoid to like the plague."
2,Basic Buddhism,"This is just a light, frothy look at Buddhism under the guise of self-awareness. There is nothing profound here."
4,It is OK,"The can is nice looking and seemingly sturdy, but the wind blows it over with ease. I think I may need to weigh it down with something."
2,Okay but out of date,"The Skateboard Book is okay if you are into oldskool skating. I do not recemend this book to any skaters that are not. The ""step-by-step"" trick tips are not very good. The information on the skate decks and trucks are out of date also. I do not recomend this book to anyone (unless if they are into oldskool skating)."
3,Scandalous!,"Glimpses into the private lives of some of the Presidents of the USA, and their love affairs...not quite up to date, but still not a bad book. A sort-of combination of history and scandal."
5,My hometown,"I love this book. It told me much more about the history and culture of the town I grew up in. Ilearned so many things I never knew for sure. Like about the First flag, Washington's troops,and the industrial history of Bound Brook. I wish I had learned these things while I still livedthere. I grew up right across from a huge house I loved that I learned from this book was thevery first house built in Bound Brook. If you happen to be from Bound Brook or are livingthere now, you must read this book. Also, a good companion to this is ""Somerset County, NJ :Crossroads of the American Revolution"" by William A. Schleicher, Susan J. Winter, & Bill Schleicher."
5,GREAT TALES!,"I really like this book, she is a great american story teller. Stuff is real life, if you enjoy a good laugh, i reccomend this book at anyone!"
3,Some Laughs,"This book tells of everyday life that many parents stress out about but it presents it in a way where people will laugh about it, maybe not while it's going on but certainly afterwards. This book did bring a few laughs and any parent could definitely relate but there were parts of the book that I was bored."
5,Brio-the best!,"Over 25 years ago my children received Brio toys as gifts--and they were so durable and fun, I buy them now as gifts for children. They are well made and stand up to many, many hours of play. I saved my children's and they look brand new...the newer ones probably will too! (The 4 stars on the ""fun"" rating is an error--should have been 5 but I can't go back and edit it....)"
2,Where's it's Mama?,"Disappointed. The toy is good quality.. but it is SO small..I didn't expect for the money this cost, to be able to fit this toy in the palm of my hand."
3,Duller side of average,"This work was insightful but it suffers from its largely anecdotal structure. Through the entire work, the author employs a ""present a short scenario - analyze the short scenario"" method. Though the author's analysis is commendable, his technique is rather tiring after a few chapters. However, if you are patient and seriously interested in the aspects of police patrol and territoriality, you should enjoy it... just be prepared for minor de ja vu."
5,Best way to memorize the presidents,"For years, I have tried to get my reluctant memory to soak up the list of US presidents -- even using goofy mnemonic pictures from GENERAL memory books.That picture stuff doesn't work, I thought.I was wrong. After a few days of browsing through the funny memory cartoons and doing the quizzes, I know the presidents cold. And so will you.I got my child to read this book with me as it's not supposed to be a ""grownup"" way to study the US presidents. Baloney! It's a great memory book for readers of all ages."
4,Great fun!,"Well, I know my Presidents now, that's for sure! I had great fun learning them, too, sitting on the couch with my husband one afternoon. The two of us went through the book, working through it and giggling at the references all the while. It was a lot of fun and we learned every president during the read. I planned to buy it, learn them, and then relist the item. But, I decided to instead hold onto it for when my nieces come over. I am always hunting for new ways to entertain them and this will keep them busy for sure! :) Lots of fun for all ages.I highly recommend that you buy it and have as much fun as we did, and learn a little something, too! 5 stars!"
5,Awesome,"After one night, I knew all 43 presidents of the United States in order without looking. This book is AWESOME!!! :D"
1,Recycled Photos,"Taunton needs to take a rest. Their books are usually very good, but lately I've noticed the same pictures appearing again and again. If you've seen their ""Built-Ins"" or ""Storage"" books, you've seen it all. This slim volume is a rip-off and an insult to the reader. Do they actually think that people won't recognize the photos? Take it out of the library - don't buy it."
4,"Good ideas, great pictures","I loved the pictures in this book. There were lots of great ideas. It's definitely a reference book and not a ""how to"" book."
2,Like looking at a magazine full of outdated ads.,"It could be that I made the mistake of thinking this was a light DIY book based on my other Tauntan publications. Unfortunately I was wrong since this is mainly a picture book with broad and generic ideas that are very difficult to actually implement. In my opinion the content is substantially lacking. There are barely any ""detailed"" descriptions for any given outlay. Normally even an older publication has it's merits, but I felt like I was flipping through a back-issue of a random home-owner's magazine. There were of course some interesting designs, but it's pretty hard to go any further with just a single image.There is simply too much other great literature out there that is better suited for finding the right idea, and at least getting a few starting points. But as I mentioned, perhaps I simply expected too much from this book."
3,Not so easy...,"Don't be fooled - these are not easy airplanes to make well!I'm not a skiled origami artist, but I can fold most paper airplanes with great precision. The planes in this book lean more toward origami than functional paper airplanes.The planes do look cool, but they're not the best performers in terms of flight.To be fair, I'm not convinced that I've folded them well enough to really judge how well they should fly, but many of them have very small wings...The planes do not require any cutting or glue, but they do need tape.Another thing to note is that most of the planes require a ruler to find the location of the fold. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but I personally prefer to be able to just grab a piece of paper and turn it into a great flyer with no other tools.Bottom line: if you want cool looking planes from a single uncut piece of paper, this book is for you. If you want great flyers, you may want to go elsewhere."
5,Exquisite Interceptors,"This book is filled to the rim with fun and challenging planes!The person before me that wrote a rewiew does not know how to fold these wonderful planes. I can succesfully fold all of them, and to mention they fly like a charm! So if you are having difficulty folding these planes, Try using a different sheet of paper or adjusting. You`ll get it sooner or later!"
3,THIS BOOK IS TOO LONG!,"Everything about Australia's fire history from its geologic origins to the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires can be found in this book. Perhaps a little too much. We learn about everything from the Flora and Fauna of the continent, to aboriginal fire practices, to modern fire fighting techniques. If one wishes to know about all of this, then the Burning Bush is an indespensible source. For those with more narrow interests, be weary. I bought the book to learn about the major fires that have devastated the country periodically. The accounts are there, but the first one appeared 220 pages into the book! All of the accounts combined cover only around twenty pages. Readers with similar interests will find the book to be a 400 page yawn. Pyne would have been better served to narrow his focus a bit. It's all there, but more than most other books the reader will want to refer to the index rather than slog through each page."
1,This is a waste of money!,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter and it did not excite her one bit! First of all, the ironing board is so short, she has to kneel to pretend to iron! Secondly, she wanted one that made realistic noises. I'm still searching."
4,"a little disappointed, but loves it anyway","We were disappointed with how short this toy is. The box made it look as though the child could stand and iron with it. My daughter got frustrated trying to put it on a table. But once she figured it out, she now sits and irons any time I am ironing, and loves the toy."
1,Pin-X,"This product is over priced and does not work!Please consult your doctor for him/she to refer you to a specialist in the field.Pinworms are very hard to get rid of and spread rapidly in a very short period of time. You are also you are very contagious and can infect many.Seeking a doctor for pinworm infestation is the best advice.Sincerely,Been there done that!"
1,Didn't work for us x2,We have had issues with pinworm in our family. Once someone in the family gets infected it spreads like wildfire. Especially if said person is a child! We tried using Pin-X following the directions and everyone was still itching a few days later. I searched online and read how some people will need to take a second dose 2 weeks after the first. I decided to give Pin-X a second try using this method and again it did nothing for us.
1,Need parts,"Omix-Ada 17720.14 Fuel Tank, it would have been nice if you would have had the other parts that go with this tank. Now I have a tank that is a paper weight. The parts that are available are for a newer jeep."
4,Key Changes/yes-Vocal eliminator/maybe,"I bought the Vocopro DTX-5000G for my wife as well as our Church to use every Sunday when the choir or individuals sing to accompaniment CD's. We use it though a PA, and we find the key changer is the biggest asset of the unit. It is very easy to use and does add echo and sonic enhancer to the music as well. As far as the vocal eliminator, do not buy this if you think you are going to eliminate vocals from CD's so you can sing the lead! Only about 10% of the CD's we have tried does this feature work completely as stated. The rest of the 90%,what it does is muffle the lead singers voice, but it also muffles the complete song! So the quality is not as good as the original. You can get away with overpowering the lead with your singers voice if the two voices are similar, but obviously the song has to be sung completely identical..We find this is ok for less experienced singers,but not for quality singers."
3,The book is new,"The style on the other hand is really difficult to read, even is the theory maybe on point, until the next one arrive. I wish post-modernist would stop talking to themselves"
3,I found it very helpful,"Through elaborate use of master works, this author was able to communicate to me important compositional points that have eluded me for a long time. Or...maybe I am just dense. I would appreciate suggestions from others on compositional books of this type....thanks"
3,incomplete for the beginner,"If you're a beginning student of art this book will probably frustrate you. Poore sounds like a stuffy college professor--he knows his stuff but has trouble getting his students to understand the lesson. Not enough examples to really grasp the concepts unless, frankly, you already understand them. It's definitely a useful book, but I just needed more help from the teacher."
2,Study of eye movements makes some of Poore's theories obsolete,"Studies of saccadic movements show that the eyes jump quickly between points of interest. Poore's diagram of the path of the eye tracing an arc in from the edge of the painting ""Christina's World"" seems laughable. While this book makes many interesting points, it is based on outdated conjecture."
2,Interesting and important subject but poorly presented,"I bought this book because the subject is very important and the reviews were so elogious. I was disappointed in the design of the book, it shows mostly nineteen century paintings (Old Masters), entirely in black and white except for four images.This book could have been designed and printed back in 1912 and it sure looks it. On the positive side, the paper stock is good, a pleasant cream color, no fluorescent whitening agent."
4,Needs more color,"This is a nice book for artist's. Even though most pages are in black and white, it is usefull and has a lot of info for readers. Im happy with it."
1,Poor,"Ok, I am the ""odd -man-out"" compared to the other reviews. I found this book hard to understand and the pictures hard to see. I like M. Schutzke's book much better and The Famous Artist's School Commerical Art text excellent( in fact,the School still exists and you can take lessons which I did !)."
2,there are superior books,"nathan goldstein's design & composition contains more info on composition without mixing the elements of design into structure. poole was touted as the end all, but alas he leaves out much on structure and dwells on elements of design as most do.Design and Composition"
3,Not so sure about traditional...,"A lot of the basic points the author makes are very valid, and integral to learning weapons defense. However, beyond that, the overall dvd was unimpressive:The rehearsal of the ukis must have been limited, since the demonstrations were not fluid whatsoever, with visible mistakes. These mistakes were sometimes attempted to be teachable moments, but as they were unplanned, didn't shed as much light or have as much impact as they could have. There is also little to no explanation about what makes the moves Yang Jwing-Ming traditional. I would have preferred to see a deeper explanation of the traditional technique with the dagger attack, without that, this DVD basically looks like a bunch of universal knife attack defense techniques."
4,If You Love the BSC Series This One's For You,"I watched these BSC videos in my late elementary school days, when my love for the BSC novels was at it's height. In Mary-Anne and the Brunettes, Mary-Anne faces off with her rival Cookie for Logan's affection. I gave this move 4 stars because, while genrally entertaining to BSC fans, others might find it too wholesome and corny. It was very interesting to see the characters in the novels come to life on the small screen. Also, I would hve liked to see something based on the plotline of a BSC novel instead of one being written specifically for the show. All in all this video is worth you half-hour espacially if your a Baby-Sitters club fan."
4,VIDEO #1 GREAT!,A good movie ...but something in me says that there are better BSC vhs tapes. This is the first Baby-Sitters Club video I have seen! It has a sweet ending. Great video if you like The Baby-Sitters Club!Video #1
5,Hell-tastic,"I received a copy as a gift and absolutely loved it. Dollison's hilarious commentary blends well with the collection of quirky and offbeat vignettes. I'm not an avid churchgoer, yet I still enjoyed the entire book from cover to cover. I even purchased copy for one of my co-workers! I highly recommend purchasing a copy. You'll laugh your way back to the Reformation!"
2,Low quality tie,"Tie was very low quality, but I was able to wear it at least once, so I guess it was worth the low price I paid."
3,Aging country singer and composer.,"Another of Horton Foote's sensitive explorations of people going through life, making choices, loss, and then understanding outcome to these decisions when what is important surfaces. Robert Duvall, as usual, delivers a beautiful portrayal of this aging, alcoholic singer at the crossroads of his life. His singing - he does it - is perfect. Music is lovely ."
5,Higher Octave #4,Awesome CD. Based on this CD I purchased the whole set of the Higher Octave series. Great mix of awesome artists.Mike
2,inside windows media,"Good overview if you're using Microsoft encoder. Lacks depth in specifications, technical issues, etc."
3,"Alright, but I would like to see more on dynamic broadcasts","The book is alright for the encoding guys, and the ""bitrate-conscious"". But there are many of us that would like more on dynamic ASX files, dynamic ad placement, and things like that. I would like to see more on utilization of ASP, and some of the other Microsoft products, like AD server. When there is a book that puts ALL of that together, it will get my 5 stars.There are also numerous typos, looks like it was rushed to press.Good handbook and reference on the standards and basics."
4,Story in the form of music from behind the scenes hitman!,"This cd from mario jsut shows how much of a talent he is in front of all the work he did with badboy and various other artists like Lil Kim, Ginuwune and others. If you want to talk about an album that has slow jams galore with a different twist and that you will feel becasue its different...then this is the cd. Songs like ""think about you"" and ""Arouse"" just sum up what I mean. There are some upbeat songs but overall everything is set for the ""love"" or ""Bedroom"" mode. Dont sleep on mario......he is another badboy hitman that is about to take his place on the front stage.Get it!"
5,Serious R&B,I first listened to this album in 1999 and it has been on the top of my all time favourite R&B list since. His music is very original and he did most of the production himself! This is a definite must buy for the R&B enthusiast looking for some serious uplifting and soothing music. Highly recommended.Still eagerly awaiting a follow up Mario...
5,BUY IT NOW!,I had this cd for about six months. Loved it from front to back. The whole cd is TIGHT! My husband (wanna' be thug/gangsta') heard the cd and stole it. If he likes the cd trust me that is the kind of endorsement PR departments dream of getting. Believe me this is a cd you can seduce a women with and still win her heart.
3,shows a lot of promise,"lots of potential, lyrically and vocally. also like the stuff he did on tamia's cd. has promise as a producer, too."
5,One of the most complete albums you'll ever hear!,"It has been almost 3 years since I first got into Mario, and I still listen to this disc often. This album was one that took me into a young man's heart. Winans shows how a man can feel emotionally, as opposed to focusing on what he can do physically. The lyrics, the production and Mario's soothing vocals all came together to make one complete album. One of the best of 97."
2,Charging requirements rediculous.,"I only got as far as reading the directions for this item, It required 18 hour initial charge and then after a max usage of 35 minutes It requires 7 to 8 hours recharge to attain 50 percent battery charge"
4,Worked fine,"Used to spray insecticide around home and basement. Had a nice fine spray and easily to control wand. Had one burst from pumping, but I think it was my error in use not the equipment."
3,it broke,I bought this in March 2011. Today the tank handle mechanism broke. Can't be opened or pumped. It worked really well for a year and a half.
2,Will not hold pressure,"You get what you pay for. The damn thing won't hold pressure, it seems to be leaking from the funnel top..."
1,This item tore up after first,The sprayer keeps popping lose .. the part you press with your thumb doesnt stay in tact and pops off... therefore you cannot use the sprayer so I have a sprayer full of insecticide I cannot use....Need to come up with better design
4,excellent sprayer,"Based on my first use I would rate this an excellent sprayer for the homeowner. The valve closed tight as soon as the handle was released and did not allow any residual drip to occur unlike a Solo sprayer that I recently returned to Costco. The nozzle easily adjusted from a fine, cone shaped mist to a stream. All parts screwed together tight and it pumped up and held the pressure with minimal effort. I would have given it five stars if it had a pressure release valve. Great deal for the money from a NY based manufacturer."
1,missing part,"I have purchased several chapin sprayers over the years and always been pleased. This version was surprisingly less well built (ie, less sturdy). After simple assembly according to instructions, the sprayer worked fine for awhile and then the sprayer handle started falling off. I went back to the instructions and they showed a piece called the locking mechanism but said it was not on all models. This part was not on the handle I received and wasn't in the parts list. Fortunately this piece was on one of my older models so I put it on the new sprayer handle and the problem was solved. Called Chapin and they sent the part within a few days. Normally I would have written this off to an isolated packing problem but I also purchased the 2 gal version of the same sprayer with the same problem. If I wasn't familiar with the product design the sprayer would have been unuseable."
5,Phil Rocks,Phil is awesome best fiddler in the world ya hes great I love him Jonathan is a RADICAL guitar player too yup this is a great cd and buy it! its cool I recommend it highly!!!
4,Outstanding Value!,"Very Nice monitor. I am using it with a Mac G4 and it works just fine. It does not work with the pass through power so I have to actually turn the power on with the switch.....no big woop! No power brick which is great!Outstanding Value! A bright 19"" LCD monitor for [...] delivered to my door! Same monitor....Best price locally was [...]! Same monitor in black is [...] more! A little steep I thought! However you do have a choice! I would buy another if I had the need! Most B/M stores do not like to show this one next to others!! I can see why!"
2,It is not 3X magnifying glass - the true magnification is 2X.,"As the title says it, it is not a 3X magnifying glass - the true magnification is 2X. As soon as I received the glass and tried to look through it, I got suspicious, since it did not magnify things that much. Looking all over the package for information about the magnification I could not find any. The package barely has anything written on it at all. Then I measured the magnification myself and confirmed that it is actually 2X. If you plan to give the glass as a toy to your kids, it might be a good thing - you do not want your kid to look through the glass at the sun and damage (or even lose) their vision (the energy density in the sun's image will go as magnification squared). But if you want to look at tiny details of something, the glass is not a good choice.That said, I returned the glass as not matching the description.Oh, yes, the frame and the handle of the glass are made of plastic. The handle screws onto the frame. Looks flimsy."
2,Cheap Quality,Not a great product but may be adequate for some people for the price. Lens is not ground well and handle and bezel are seemingly weak and likely to fail. I should have sent this back but forgot until grace period ran out. I would suggest purchasing another product instead of this one.
1,Needs Serious Help,"I am sorry to say this, but Piratica is one of the most poorly written books I have read in any genre. Rediculously silly plot which didn't for a moment succeed in supending my interest or imagination, passible characterization, passible use of period dialect, simplistic prose, and barely passible historical setting. In short, the author was unable to transport me, and I was constantly aware of these flaws and annoyed at every turn. This had the feel of a bad Romance novel, without the romance. I learned nothing from this book, and had the feeling I had wasted money on very bad candy.Bitterly disappointed. Fortunately I found solace in Pirates! by Celia Reese, and most sublimely glorious escape in Louis A. Meyer's two masterpieces: Bloody Jack and Curse of the Blue Tatoo."
2,"Mediocre, yet disapointing.","I didn't enjoy this book at all, and didn't even attempt to force myself to finish it. I might have enjoyed it if I had been brainwashed and forgot a couple of other amazingly well-written historical fiction about pirates, the navy, and the 18th century; but alas, I fully understood what a flop this book is.What could be an enjoyable past time for some, is torture for me. Where is the suspense, the action, the gritty reality? I need something concrete, yet singular!If you too were disapointed, check out the real deal, and some of the absolute BEST books on the market: The Bloody Jack Series by L.A. Meyers. Compared to his works of masterpiece, this stuff is complete trash."
2,<Scream> wierd writing style,"The first thing that jumped out at me was the writing style. It was almost as if sh'ed written the first few chapters in first person, then changed her mind.This was a rather good book, as it is. But Tanith Lee made Art and oh-crud-i-can't-remember-his-name way to gushy near the end. It felt like apple sauce. But i'm not a big fan of romance, i cringe as i pass that section in the library.The pirate/actor dudes were pretty awesome, even if they did advertise coffee at one pointAnd the evil chick was awesome, way smarter then Artemisa. I for one would have done the same thing if i had been on trial for a hanging. It would probably hurt, ya know?There are many things we would throw away if we weren't afraid someone else would find them.-sisterhood of the traveling pants 3. Hey, i'll review that next..."
2,There are better uses of your time,"Far be it from me to discourage anyone from reading - anything. However, that being said, this book is much less inspirational and interesting than many other books one could be reading. I myself enjoy reading low-brow and kiddie lit and pirate stories as much as anyone, but this book manages to avoid being sufficiently well-written while nevertheless failing to fall into the trap of being enjoyably trashy and guiltily fun."
2,Not for outside use!,"My dogs did not like this house as it has no insulation to keep them warm. If you get strong winds it will blow over as it's very light weight. If you live in a warm place all year round with little wind it might be good, but after a year and my dogs didn't use it I gave it away to a friend. I always bring them inside at night and in bad weather anyway and feel this was a waste of money. Better to build your own out of wood with insulation and a shingle roof."
2,Dog House: Not Loved by the Dog,"The first shipment was missing 1 box, so we had to return the box and ask Amazon to reship. They sent another dog house in two days, so I was impressed with how Amazon handled the return.The house looks more sturdy here in the picture than it actually is in person. It's very lightweight - which is good and bad. It's easy to assemble and move around the yard. If my dog wanted, she could probably move it herself. I like the house - we live in a warm climate so it's main purpose is to keep her dry. The problem is my dog - golden retriever - absolutely hates it. She won't go in the house! Hopefully in time, she'll start to like the house. I'm placing her toys and food inside in hopes that it will encourage her. Go figure!!"
2,Roof caves in when door climbs on the roof,We only had this since April 2011 and our dog loves to get on top of the house to rest and relax. The roof caves in when he sits on the roof. For the price that we paid for this house you would certainly think that the roof constuction would be much sturdier than it is. We are dissappointed with the sturdiness of the material and wont buy a product from this manufacturer in the future. If I had known that the roof was so fragile I would not have purchased this dog house.
4,Not for a Great Pyrennes full grown,"Fortunately one of my Pyrs is a 45 pound pup and she fit nicely for now but Beaux is 115 pounds and he would probably pop the roof off. I would say good for an 80 pound dog. Easiest construction ever, get tent pegs to hold it down."
3,WEAK ROOF,"Big sturdy dog house except for the roof. I like how the floor has grooves so moisture is channeled away from the dog. However, my biggest complaint is the roof. I have a 75# dog that likes to curl up on the roof. Problem is, the roof caves in. After about 14 months, cracks started developing along the shingles and the roof line. Now those cracks are gaping holes."
5,Dog House,"We bought 2 of these for our 2 Siberian Huskies. We were so please with the duriablity and ease of assembly! We have had them for almost 3 months now, and we see them lasting a long time!! The dogs love them, and each sleep in their own, even though they both could fit in one. Our Huskies are 5 months old and already huge. I am glad to say they have plenty of room to keep these houses as they are fully grown! We did buy dog beds to put in them, so they are cozy at night."
4,answer -person who wants to know 1st song on lilo and stitch,"Just to let you know, He Mele No lilo, it's on the soundtrack."
1,"I don't think these are haole fav's, let alone island fav's","I ordered this CD based solely on reviews (I completely overlooked the artist list and option to preview the tracks--Doh!) and was disappointed. I am part Hawaiian and though raised wholly on the mainland, exposure to Hawaiian culture was inherent. The songs on this CD, other than the signature soundtrack songs, are totally HAOLE (""Hal-ay""), which means white man. But then again, I'm not sure most Haole's would even appreciate this music--these really are bottom of the bucket selections, folks. Take the time to listen to the samples provided by Amazon and you'll see how annoying most of the tracks are. My suggestion, don't waste your money on this fake'i, buy the original soundtrack for its Hawaiian originals and bonus-familiar-everyday-favorites, then look for a real Hawaiian CD like Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu's (the guy who wrote the cool Lilo & Stitch Hawaiian songs) ""Call it what you like."""
4,For A Music Fan,"""He Mele No Lilo"" is the first song in the movie, and it is on both the ""Island Favorites"" and Soundtrack CDs. I'm not a big Elvis fan, so this CD was a much better choice for me. ""Aloha OE"" is the song that Lana (big sister) sings to Lilo in the hammock after she explains that the family will be broken up."
1,Not a good buy,"I purchased 3 as small gifts for my sisters along with 3 rings, I did not know that the heart pendant was so small. I am truly dissapointed, it is smaller than my pinky finger nail.=("
3,It is ok,"It is just ok, not very pretty nor bad. If you want to buy for little girls, it is good, not for adults."
4,"for the price, it is a great little necklace...","I bought this a WHILE ago, and i still have it, and still wear it. (its maybe 1 or 2 years old) the necklace is very dainty, and small. i like the clasp, so you can put it at the length you like it. the diamonds are VERY small, but you can deff. see them when you look real close. My necklace still has not broken, so im gonna say that its something you can wear every day and its not gonna break too easily."
4,"It ""grows"" on you.","My first impression was one of great disappointment since I had high hopes based on the glowing reviews here. I was expecting it to be small...but not THAT small; it's literally smaller than a dime, maybe even half the size of a dime! The chain is dainty, the diamonds virtually non-existant. I threw it in a box, but on a whim, decided to try it on anyways...and was pleasantly surprised! Although tiny, it works great as just a little ""oomph"" when you're in one of those moods not to wear any jewelry at all. Also, it would look great with a beautiful shirt, like one with an embellished collar since it wont distract from your main focal point.For the price, it is well worth it as it hint at being girly and feminine in a very subtle way.By the way, I'm 28, and usually prefer big bold jewelry."
5,Beautiful pendant for young girls,"I just received this pendant today, and I am thrilled. I purchased it for one of my nieces, and now I wish I had ordered more than one! It is quite small, as expected, and it shines and sparkles much more than the picture shows. The chain is delicate but seems sturdy enough, and it is a nice match for the heart. Yes, the individual diamonds are so tiny one can hardly see them, but they make the whole pendant sparkle, a lovely effect. Perfect for a young girl, and a bargain as well!"
3,"long on archaeology and art history,",short on good anecdotes and local color. and a rather dry style to boot. I love good travel writing and could not finish this book.
2,Review,"I bought this video as a follow up to the Abs of Steel one. I didn't like it much. Most of the video is low impact aerobics, that are hard to follow even if you are used to follow aerobic classes. The toning segment is the only part of the video that is appropriately called Abs of Steel. The segment is quite good, but short and this is what I was looking for in the first place."
1,Disappointing,"I am glad to read in another review that it was hard to follow even if you had taken a lot of aerobics classes, because I kept losing focus when I would get lost. The routine built to a very complicated dance that was too hard to follow without stopping to rewind a bit and finally give up and make up something to keep my heart rate up.I hated the chatting between the instructors, and I thought the abs section was really too light. If you do a lot of cheerleading-type dance, and you are looking for a low-impact tape, I am sure this is great."
3,good workout-but tape is too long!!!,"I'll admit that this is a good workout tape. However after about a month, I got bored. Also the tape is long enough to let you burn the calories, but too long if you are a busy person such as I."
2,"No aerobics, and QUIET PLEASE!!","I bought this tape thinking that I would get an intense abdominal toning session, and instead, there is long stretch of aerobics at the beginning. I am not a big fan of aerobics in the first place, due to the chirping and ranting of most instructors and the idiotic and pointless flailing that it usually entails. Okay, fine. I don't do aerobics, and limit my cardio workout to sensible things like walking or commuting by bike or swimming. This leads me to the second complaint I have about the video, and that is the leader's incessant chatter throughout. Why can't they just COUNT! I find myself actually yelling at them to SHUT UP!! Which, actually works my abs a little harder, so there might be a reason for this annoying banter after all. At one point, the third instructor actually changes the exercise in mid-execution. I thought this was very sloppy. But, I must say, the workout itself is satisfying and produces results, if you can stand it."
1,Very Disapointed,"I really cannot say enough BAD things about this video. The reason I bought the video in the first place was to work on my abs. The tiny little abs work out they have included after 30 minutes of low impact aerobics was really pathetic. Personally I can't see how the few situps that are included in the work out could have any effect. Just as you are beginning to feel the muscle working the ""exericze bunnies"" are slamming you around to work something else. The video ended and I was angry. I had wasted 50 minutes of my time on exercizes that are literally worthless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS VIDEO!"
4,Abs Of Steel,"I really thought that this was a great workout for weightloss, because it combined aerobics with toning and I lost 20 pounds in 2 months doing this everyday. I really like it thought it was good and I recently purchased the thigh of steel 2000."
5,Surprised by the negative reviews. I love this tape!,"I owned this tape, along with the other platinum series tapes, when I was a college student in the late 90s. My body looked amazing then. Well...once I turned thirty, my body had gotten flabby and out of shape. I returned to this tape, along with the others, and my body quickly got back into shape. The combination of aerobics/toning gets you faster results. The aerobics will get rid of the layer of fat so you can see the toned abdominal muscles underneath. You really need both cardio and toning to get that six pack look. The aerobics are very dance-like, which I love, because it does not feel like working out and it makes the cardio fun. But if you hate dance workouts and are not very coordinated, then I can see while you would hate this tape. But the workout is very effective and I would recommend it."
2,"Ok game, terrible support","Dominions II, while lovingly designed and balanced, due to its amateurish graphics, plays like a spreadsheet. The game itself is good enough to rise above this, however the tech support is abysmal. When the most recent patch was released, I was unable to apply it. When I contacted the developers for assistance, they were obtuse and unhelpful, eventually simply referring me to the message boards to get help from other players, refusing to even tell me if my problem was common, or unique. I love the idea of supporting small development houses, however, this one is small because they seem to think small."
4,Excellent strategy game,"There aren't many games now-a-days that can get me interested enough to play regularly, but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does.It's a multiplayer, multi-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux), turn-based strategy game. There is a tun of different strategies to go with, many nations, magic items, spells, different units. Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person.The only drawback is the interface. It's certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to. But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff.I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multiplayer turn-based strategy. It's the best I've ever played (and I've played quite a few)"
4,this is a STRATEGY game!,"I emphasize strategy. What you will not find are fancy graphics, studio sound, arcade action, cheats, or a killer strategy that will win every time. This game is wonderfully balanced with 17 nations (another in the works), 1100 units, 400 spells, 400 magic sites, 250 magic items, and much more. But the neat thing is that they give you what you need to play in YOUR style. Berserker, defensive, researcher, swarmer, sneak, diplomatic, whatever. Instead of feeling like you are learning the strategies that the developer had in mind for you to learn, you can actually develop your OWN tactics and surprises. There are people who have played it over a year and still come up with new things to try. (and yes, its one of those games which will ACTUALLY survive on your machine for a year)"
4,An playable multiplayer turn based strategy game,"Difficult to learn and an awkward user interface - besides that, this is the best turn-based strategy game I ever played!It is ideal for Offline-Multiplayer (Serverbased or via PBEM), since all players take their turns simultaneously, which allows PBEM games to be finished within reasonable time. Highly customizable. OS independent.Disappointed by WalordsIV, I am now very happy to finally have found a cute, playable, turn-based fantasy strategy game."
3,Well written,"I read this book beacause I wanted to learn more about the Scopes Trial. It is well written and provides an excellent background to the circumstances that led up to the Scopes Trial. Nevertheless, I do not agree with the popular myth advocated in this book, that evolution is factual science and biblical creation is for out-of-date, ignorant, old-fashioned people. I would recommend this book for the purpose of obtaining a solid background knowledge of the Scopes Trial. It is informing, succinct and very interesting."
4,Brando's Charm,"A great Chicago based and very solid rock group of the 1990's that was a regular headliner at clubs like Metro & Double Door and featured on Mancow in the morning and Richard Milnes WXRT local anesthetic. They had a killer drummer, a great singer that was reminiscent of Chris Cornell, and solid guitars. This album ""Soul"" was their first self released album that is difficult to find. They later released an ep called ""SUN"" after this with the local Aemp Records after recording at Gravity Studios."
3,Sad but wrought with insight,"Following the Jewish-Arab dynamic in Israel is many things. It can be depressing, infuriating and even filled with hope. But it is never boring.Jaffa follows much the same pattern."
4,Frustration saver,"Expensive piece of hardware, but it works. If you use a band saw frequently, it is a good buy. If de-tensioning the blade is important to you, this is the way to do it."
3,watch out for handle weakness,"I have had this item for just over a year now. I agree with a previous poster that this item isn't necessary but a nice convenience, until the handle broke on me. In fact it was yesterday when I finished changing a blade and was returning the handle to the full tension setting. Without much force being used the handle snapped at the base, futhest away from the knob. So much for the great quality on this item. I thing for the price of replacement I will just weld the two pieces back together and see what happens."
1,Iron Maiden has died,"I had never heard about this release untill i found it here. After listening to the samples I know why. This is not the Iron Maiden we all listened too before. To put is simply ""It just sucks!"" Sincerely diapointed A fan"
1,Yet another attempt at Godliness failed.,"When I hear this album, it hurts my ears to hear my and thousand other people's favorite band's songs get destroyed by other bands. Sure, Iron Maiden was a great influence on many bands, but if you're going to try to re-create their sound, at least practice for longer than two days. No real highlights, and the only decent band on the album Steel Prophet chose a weaker Maiden song. Not only is the song selection is poor for most of the album (Total Eclipse? Gangland? Public Enema Number One?), but the death metal bands mutilate the songs. The only decent remakes on this record is Mystic Force's version of Where Eagles Dare. God forbid you choose this title as your first CD carrying the name Iron Maiden. This is ugliness."
3,Much better musicinshgip.,"Oh look! It's number two! I didn't expect the gates of tribute to open wide, and flood the bins! But here is the second tribute album to Maiden. Granted the ""Revealations"" version and ""Children of the Damn"" stick to the original renditions, a very good strategy, the rest is simply not up to par. Rod Smallwood wouldn't manage any of these acts unless he felt he needed to blow loads of cash out the door. Not to mention a good reputation. Well, if you liked the first one, check this one out. It's............interesting."
1,A Death Metal Tribute to Iron Maiden,"It's very simple. If you like Death Metal, you're likely to find something of interest on this album. If you don't, it doesn't matter how much you love Iron Maiden, this album is not for you.It should, more properly, be called ""A Call to Irons 2: A Death Metal Tribute to Iron Maiden"". There are a few tracks which are not death metal, but they sound like they're trying to recreate Maiden songs instead of giving us their own spin on Maiden - you might as well do yourself and listen to Maiden themselves."
5,Wonderfull,"A trully wonderfull collection of Iron Maiden's clasic tracks, played with in a fresh manner...."
3,Alter Water For Electric Stovetop Cooking,"Eh, OK rice. Flavor was a bit mild for me. Prefer Lundberg. Very fresh rice, though! If you prefer the taste of white rice over brown, you may like this rice.I only make my rice on stovetop, using stainless steel cookware on an electric stove. If you use that method of rice cooking and use the suggested amount of water on the jar, it will turn out mushy. Using 1 c rice and 1 1/2 c water works much better."
1,BEWARE: Consumer Report fount Textmati Rice Contains Arsenic,"Consumer Reports November 2012 issue found that most rice harvested in Texas. Per the consumer report, this brand of rice was found to contain 4.2 to 7.6 micrograms of arsenic per 1/4 cup uncooked serving. It is recommended that you consume no more than 1-2 servings of this rice per week.View the [...] for more information about issues with arsenic in rice from Texas.Bottom line: DONT BUY THIS RICE. Long grain brown rice from California, Thailand, and other areas typically do not contain arsenic."
2,"nice flavor, terrible texture","I've been making brown basmati rice for a while now. But Costco stopped carrying it, so I looked online. I ordered this brand. It has basmati taste and aroma, without any of the basmati texture. It's mushy. I followed the directions perfectly. Then even tried soaking and rinsing it several times before hand. It still came out mushy. I might be doing something wrong, most people seem to like it. But I think it's the rice. I like Royal Brown Basmati rice better, from India, I think."
1,Failed Shipment,Ordered this on August 29 with overnight shipping and 2 days later still not even shipped out.
5,Terrific Rice!,"RiceSelect Organic Texmati has become the rice of choice in this house, and is consumed nearly every day. Wonderfully consistent texture, rich, nutty flavor, and it fluffs nicely. The packaging is convenient (and non-BPA).To the 1-star reviewers, claiming that this product is GMO, 30 seconds of research would have shown you that it is NOT.""...all RiceSelect products are produced from our non-GMO proprietary seed and is grown by our farmers under strict supervision in the United States. This complete control through the production process allows us to ensure that our products will not be co-mingled with other varieties that may have GMO traits.""I love this this rice. Would recommend it to anyone who likes brown rice!"
3,"Good, But Not 5-Star...","We like all kinds of rice, especially brown and basmati. This rice is very good, but not 5-star. It arrived quickly and in very good condition, mostly due to the excellent packaging. It is the amongst the FRESHEST rice we've ever purchased (and we've purchased from the source). It has a wonderful taste and aroma. After cooking several batches, both on the stove and in our Zoji Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, we like it, but find the texture to be just okay. We've had better textured varieties in the past. The grains are on the short side for ""long grain"" and they explode a little too much, even when we used less water. It is very good, for brown rice; just not quite as good, for brown basmati. We would buy it again, but not as our only source of brown basmati."
5,Texmati Brown Rice,"I make a meal using one cup of raw rice heated in olive oil, then cooked in water with three cups of frozen mixed vegetables and four Tyson chicken thighs. There is no seasoning added. When I used this rice instead of ordinary white rice, my husband commented on how delicious it was compared to the usual. Texmati brown rice added a delicate perfume to the dish which complemented perfectly the mild flavors of the other ingredients."
2,Where's the plot?,"This book, although it had some value, was somewhat confusing. You'd think if the book was entitled ""Dora Bruder"" there would be more information on her yet he spends much of his time talking about random aspects of World War II. For someone who maybe has an extensive knowledge or interest in the subject this book may have more value that it had to me. However, it was a fairly simple read and was interesting in the sense that you realize how many millions of untold stories of WWII there are. Other than that, I wouldn't really recommend this book."
4,"Works well, looks good",We bought this item so that our water would not stagnate in our bird bath and for the most part it works well. You will still have to watch for build up of algae on the moveable part of this product because it will stop. It looks a lot nicer then the plain white water wiggler.
1,Broke almost instantly- never worked anyway.,"This was really cute when I saw it online. I ordered it and put it in my birdbath. Unfortunately, I noticed baby mosquitos swimming in birdbath like it was a sauna only days later.Also, the legs are flimsy and it fell over many times. This caused the machine to flood out and become water damaged.What a waste."
5,This worked well,"My water wiggler ran all summer on one set of batteries. The only problem was when a small leaf got pulled in. This stopped the water wiggler, but once the leaf was removed it worked fine again."
4,water wiggler,"Been working well for 2 summer months now. Functions as described. Only minor quibble is that it feels as if it must be handled carefully, but is holding up with no defects yet."
5,Just Perfect,"I had a bird bath near a bird feeder and the birds would never go to the bird bath. After putting in the Water Wiggler, they began coming to the bird bath! It works great and even looks nice standing in the bird bath. Can't go wrong with this Water Wiggler it does what it's suppose to do... wiggle the bird bath water to attract birds."
2,What happened to Ana Colchero?,"I watched the 18 hour DVD version and didn't notice a lot of missing scenes, although I'm sure it doesn't include the entire broadcast version. It's not a great telenovela. Rogelio Guerra is fantastic as the villain, Lupita Ferrer is simply terrible as his wife. She can't act, period. Demian Bichir is good as usual. Jose Angel Llamas is almost as bad as Lupita Ferrer. All he knows how to do is shout. In the role of lead babe, Ana Colchero is adequate, but barely. I would like to know why she was replaced after 15 hours by Christiane Gout. Pregnancy? Sickness? Contract dispute? Does anyone know? She was somewhat better in Corazon Salvaje, but it was a smaller part."
1,has flat spot on pin - useless,very disappointed in this rolling pin because there is a flat spot (and fairly large) on it - this won't roll anything out smoothly. very poor craftsmanship.
2,Clearly written? The previous reader must have been ...,"""confused"", to say the least ... the book is plainly horrible, it tries to explain some simple examples and then throws a lot of difficult stuff that is barely explained or not at all ... no answers to problems ... mistakes ... i don't know what to say, but certainly not recommended for undergrad use."
5,WOW! I love this book!,"I you are serious about learning what actually happens inside the computer and how it works, how your C program is translated into machine code - from C -> Preprocessor -> Assembler -> Object Code and how the computer executes the object code. + a lot of hardware stuff, digital logic, binary arithmetic and more. This is THE BOOK!You might need to read the chapters in this book a couple of times to fully understand it. But this book really helps you to understand what going on inside that beige box.Do yourself a favor, buy this book!"
3,Line spool for yardworks trimmer/ edger,it does the job and makes it easy to have new line. The only drawback is that if it hits concrete or any hard surface it will scratch up the plastic holder and eventually fall apart. Then you will need to replace it again and thats why I usually buy 2 or 3 at a time.
2,Too puny for Texas weeds,The OEM line for the YardStick is not up to much and breaks almost immeadiately when trimming around a concrete slab. Some local varieties of weeds here in Texas are also too much for it. Replacing the line with a comparable heavy duty version takes care of the problem.
1,Wrong line,"Was misled to believe that this would fit my trimmer. I cannot use it, I wasted my money and my trust."
4,Mystic World Delivers!,"First, let me say that I have payed/ GMed Champions sense the early 80s. I bought this book and am in no way working for Hero Games.This is a great book to give a GM a kick start to adding Mystic elements to his/ her game. Lots of good info on lands like- Faerie, Babylon, Elysium, etc. Also some good info on Organizations (DEMON, finally. Though a DEMON book is slated to appear later), factions and Dynasties. Along with 55 pages of Villians for your PCs to fear...or fight.It;s very well written with good easy to read layout. My one nitpick is the interior atr. The last few books from Hero have been a let down in that area and this books stays with the trend. Some very amaturish artwork inside (IMHO). Otherwise, worth the money!"
3,Turning Twenty,"The pattern was ok, I thought was more than just one pattern. I did receive in a very fast time frame. Would not buy this item again."
4,A Profoundly Shakespearean Feel to this One,"Young lovers from totally different cultures are caught in a trap of mistaken intention and greed. That's the gist of this novel and one of the best in the series. A body is found in one of the fountains in the ""Boboli Gardens"", but because its' been in the water with fish for four/five days, the face and fingers are gone and it's going to be difficult to discover her identity. There are some very nice touches as the Marshal in his dogged way tries to find out not just what happened by why it happened.This episode of the series is really about how families can both cast us out and suffocate us in. We have a Japanese girl who has fled away from what would have been an arranged marriage and the boredom of middle-class life; and an Italian boy with a bright future and a dark past. But the Marshal is able to piece together what happened and why but we find that justice is not always possible and that greed does sometimes win out.Zeb Kantrowitz"
3,Disappointed,"I was looking for a great little dollhouse to put together and decorate in my free time. When I was little I loved to build these ""do it yourself"" kits, and thought I would start out small with this one. When I got it and started to put together the pieces I found none of them matched together the way they should. I had to use hot glue to hold the pieces together. Definately disappointing. Also the front moldings did not look as pictured. I do not recommend this for anyone who doesnt want to put in their own touches to fix the mistakes of the maker."
4,CLEP Natural Sciences,I had not taken a science class in almost ten years and found the information useful. I would suggest this book because it also explains the test format and includes a practice test along with a glossary. I only used this book and I got a 490 on the test (enough to pass).
3,it's ok........,"i wouldn't be able to pass by using this book alone. i used the plato computer programs at the navy college, and a book which specifies in all the sciences. when my time was up, i had about 30 blanks. amazingly, i substantially passed w/ a 490. w/ the subject still fresh in my brain, i took the biology clep exam 4 days later, again scoring substantially high w/ a 51. it definitely helps to keep answers blank if you're not sure. i suggest looking at the outlines for both exams and getting your study material from there."
4,CLEP exam for the Natural Sciences,I found the test taking tips included very helpful. It prepared me very well for the actual exam. The content info. was moderately helpful. I did find the sample exams did not apply to the material covered in the reading section but ultimately this did help cover a broader area of study. There were actually areas on the exam not covered in the study guide as well as areas that were in fact on the exam.
2,Pathetic,"I passed the test by a decent margin, no thanks to this book. I read through the book several times, took the practice questions and exams, and when I felt I knew the material well enough I took the CLEP. I was startled at how much material there was in the CLEP that was not even touched upon by the book. I was able to answer a handful of questions correctly because of the book, but the rest I had to rely on common sense and what I remember from high school science classes.If you do get this book anyway (the other people who have reviewed the book seemed to have liked it), make sure you read EVERYTHING -- the practice tests contain material not covered in the rest of the book so every little bit helps. My kid can draw better than the artists who illustrated the book, so just ignore them. I don't remember a single instance where I needed to recall one of the illustrations."
4,Not Street Legal,"The sescription states ""100W High Beam / 80W Low Beam Street Legal: No"", but I am not sure that this is the case. I read someplace else that its an 80w HB bulb that shines like a 100w bulb. That might be more accurate. I previously had a set of CEC 100/80 bulbs, and they burnt/melted the sockets, and the replacment high performance replacement sockets as well. I replaced them with these Hella bulbs, and can tell they are not as bright, or as hot as the CEC bulbs. They are brighter than the Sylvania ""cool blue"" (100% Street Legal) lights though. So, these lights will work with your factory sockets and wiring, which works for me. I took one star away because I do not feel that they really are 100/80 watt. Just remember, they are marked for off road use only."
2,so disappointed.,"If you are looking for headlights for VW jetta 2003, do not buy it!!It is my first time writing a review. When I received this stuff. I was very happy. So I tried to install it. I tried many times. But I couldn't put it in the hole which holds headlights. Finally, I found this hella headlight is a little longer than my original one although the model number is exactly the same 9007. what can I do now?? now I opened the box.So I lost this 30bucks......I will not buy any parts on the internet. I will directly go to the dealer's shop although it is expensive."
2,"What a strange ""guide book""","As a previous reviewer noted, the guide reviews only two restaurants and two hotels. How very strange then that the reviewers selected two restaurants and two hotels that they did not particularly like. The reviews of all places are so mixed that I wouldn't bother with any of them. So based on this guide, now I am down to 0 restaurants or hotels that I would try. Why bother? Or why not list places that the reviewers liked? For me, the guide was a total waste of mony."
2,Not impressed,"This guide is so selective it's nearly useless. For example, there is no broad overview of London's gay neighborhoods, and only two hotel and restaurant recommendations each. Surely London has more to offer gay travelers than that! While the recommendations that are provided are well written and informative, I still have no concept of how I could spend a week in London other than going spot-by-spot to the various individual businesses listed here."
4,Glad I Purchased This Book,"I enjoyed this book and will probably purchase the sequels sometime. I knew so little about ""persons of color"" who became Latter-day Saints and their experiences with the white people around them, both LDS and not. The book made me laugh at times and cry at times. I would recommend this book to those who are interested in Mormon and/or Black American history."
3,Repetitive Articles,"I guess one has to realize there's not too much artistic talent one can really teach through articles on Ansel Adams. His was a talent he was born with...not one he actually learned. I enjoy articles on new equipment, reviews and George Lepp's question and answer column. There's so many great web sites with outdoor photography that it really isn't something this periodical can better."
4,A Temptation to give in to,"A wonderful collection from the Motown legends. These songs are just as listenable now as they were when they were new. Actually, considering some of the complete garbage on the radio now, these songs may sound even better."
5,This was a sleeper!,This is a great CD. My favorite song is Crush. One of those CDs to listen to over and over again.
3,solid work,"nice and smooth work but nothing spectacular. I couldn't point out ahighlight. It's what you expect from Zhane. Not bad, but not a must have."
5,Saturday Night,"I just re-ordered Zhane's ""Saturday Night"" along with their self titled debut album from 1994. I absolutely love their music! These ladies epitomize CLASS. Their sound is a mixture of jazz, neo-soul and hiphop. One minute you're jammin, the next you're mesmerized by the beauty of their love songs.Like others, I let family and friends borrow these two cds, never to see them again. I thought the cds were out of print, but to my surprise, you can order them both at an affordable price. I would highly recommend adding these two cds to your collection. I'm so surprised that no new material has been released by this fantistic duo."
2,Give it time.,"maybe in a few years i'll like this cd but, i miss the style of songs from their first cd. My favorite song would have to be, For a reason. When i first got the cd i only liked things like Mr. DJ, Vibe, Groove thing. but, i was also 13/14 then i got older and saw the true beauty of the cd and i think this is what will happen to most who own Saturday night. so in a few years you'll be loving it like the first cd."
4,If you are a slow jam fan...,"I bought this CD in 2005, after hearing a slow song on yahoo music. The fast tracks are definitely 90s but the slow jams are timeless. Makes me wonder what has happened to this duo. Awesome voices... Track 9 and 13 are my favorites."
2,Not so good,"Though I think that Lonely Planet does lovely travel guides for many places (in particular, I like their Thailand guide), they dropped the ball for the book on Japan. Their information was average, and overly disparaging of some places. Details were sorely lacking for the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, which are truly off the beaten path for most visitors to Japan and have many interesting sites/activities. The maps were also very poor, as well as the directions on how to get to places. Quite a few of us who were in Japan at the same time agreed that the Lonely Planet guide was definitely NOT the best for finding those hidden gems that Japan has within its shores. If you want a completely average and traditional tour of Japan, the Silver temple and Gold temple in Kyoto, the mania of Tokyo, and the Big Buddha in Nara, Lonely Planet suffices. But if you want any insight at all into anything off the main path, I would advise you to look elsewhere."
2,"Great restaurant info, lousy maps.","I've had a very mixed experience with this guide. While the restaurant recommendations are 100% on target, i've been mislead by the maps and directions on multiple occassions. Sometimes it's a matter of lack of detail (like failing to mention a necissary turn) but more often the directions are just plain wrong, with hotels incorrectly placed on the maps or directions that obviously weren't checked. The lonely planet formula works well, with all the essentials covered, but something in the writing style fails to capture the imagination quite so well as other guides."
4,very useful,"The lonely planet books are always great, and this one is very useful. However, if you plan to visit only Tokyo and Kyoto, you'd rather get the city guides, as the whole Japan book is big !"
3,To much to travel with,"LPJ presents a very in depth picture of Japan. If you are traveling to one place and staying for a while, LP will let you get to know the neighborhoods of your major cities. However, if you are traveling for a week or two, it goes way too in depth. The book is bulky and I didn't carry it with me as I toured around. In addition, all though the information is good, the author's have a very negative attitude (especially against the US military) leaving a bad taste in your mouth before you set out. Better books are out there."
1,You Can Do Better,"Don't fall into the Lonely Planet trap. Just because they have a great reputation doesn't mean each title is worth the money. Some titles by Lonely Planet are well done, but this one is not.This book reads as though it was written by five hundred different people and no one bothered to edit it. Just one of many examples is how one writer hardly mentions anything about transportation, while the next gives detailed descriptions of all available train, bus and ferry services. This book would be greatly improved if there was some a standardized set of information was available for each ken. Instead, it is just a mix of badly baised facts in random order.However, the section at the beginning of the book is a good introduction to Japan, with lots of interesting tidbits and tales. That section is certainly worth a look but as for the actual travel information, I'd try another series."
3,good for finding Japan's worst restaurants,"I rented a car at Narita (Tokyo) and headed north on a 3-week road trip. This book has some reasonable hotel recommendations, even at the higher end of the price scale, but it is hard to understand how the authors of the book picked restaurants. At one Lonely Planet favorite I was served a soggy tuna sandwich that might have been found in England circa 1950. A place in Sapporo billed as serving ""authentic Indian food"" had nothing on the menu that I recognized from Indian restaurants in the U.S., England, or India. Finally the only restaurant in Japan where I managed to get food poisoning was a Lonely Planet suggestion.Good on hotels, however, and the maps are helpful once you get into a city or region."
3,frustrating!,"I found this book extremely frustrating to use. I'm sure the restaurants they talk about are great... if you can find them. I found the maps and directions extremely confusing. In some of the descriptions of how to get places, they say that the places are hard to find and that you should ask someone for directions. Well, that is why I got the guidebook - so it would tell me how to get there. The descriptions of the major tourist attractions in Kyoto and whatnot are fine... but those are big cities - not exactly off the beaten track so there are plenty of places to find that info. I live in rural Japan (Toyama-ken) and the information on this region is not comprehensive and some of it is inaccurate regarding the Gokayama region.I was not impressed with this book yet it was the only book I saw tourists carrying when I was recently in Kyoto. I think there is definitely a need for a well-written book on Japan, but I'm not sure that this is it."
3,Reader beware.,"While Lonely Planet produces many fine travel books, this one is disturbing and rather invidious. I get the distinct impression that the authors do not like or respect Japanese culture and some of the statements made are frankly, quite racist. For example- ""Foreign travellers should be warned that medical services in Japan may not be on par with those of other developed nations."" ""Condoms are widely available in Japan, but generally only locally produced varieties, which tend to be on the small side."" ""Ainu traditions are re-enacted by sometimes listless performers and these tourist circuses can be pretty depressing- they are often combined with caged bears in a debased imitation of the Ainu's sacred Iyomante (Bear Festival)."" While a few subtle implications are excusable, the entire book is rife with them. Despite these flaws, the book does give a good overview of places to stay and visit."
3,Indespensible but not sufficient.,"I would not travel to Japan without this indespensible source of information. If I had to pick one book to travel with I would probably pick this one for its navigational information, cursory cultural information, etc. That said, I have rarely had success with LP's hotel and restaurant recommendations. I ate in a particularly horrid restaurant in Takayama (although I would not necessarily recommend that town for its great cuisine.) If you will be travelling independantly in Japan, you need this guide. But if at all possible carry at least one other guide as a supplement."
5,highly recommend,i am a chicana that has only recently started to listen to latin music and get into all things my culture. i bought this cd after i bought the latin groove cd this like all other putumayo cd's is amazing. again it is the trademark of putumayo to blend traditional and modern which i love. this cd was a breath of fresh air because it doesnt only play the norteno everyone is so used to. it showcases other types of mexican music. this cd is braethtaking i absoloutely love it along with putumayos latin groove and cuba cd's. there is also a kicking guacamole recipe in the mexico cd. it also shows some nahua (azteca)words and their translations. again i highly recommend this cd! putumayo comes out with some awesome releases!!
3,great packaging but not 100% pure Mexico,"The whole package from the copious liner notes in the accompanying booklet to the CD design itself with a colorful Mexico motif, this is one of the better produced products from Putumayo, a record co. I find is a second division Rough Guide really.As far as the music, you won't be blown away by any of it. It's typical stuff you hear in Mexico with nothing radical or alternative in here. Not that there is anything wrong with that.Don't really comprehend why Los Lobos are on there given they are from LA so it's probably just a marketing ploy. There are also other American artists on here so it's not really ""Mexico"" but ""Mexican and its Mexican-American immigrants' "" music. Just so you know."
4,Mexico by various Artists,My mother had bought this album after we had heard it in a store we were at. We instantly loved this CD. Being of Mexican heritage we know a lot of mexican music and we equally love this one. My favorite is the Ramon Ayala song.
3,Not the greatest quality,"The edges of the flukes on these had notches, burrs and faceting (the curves were not smooth, but made up of a series of straight segments). So, I returned them. In all fairness, I did not try them -- so they might have worked OK. I've had too much experience with professional quality tooling and the sloppy look of these just turned me off.The supplier, however, had no problem with giving me a refund."
3,Not for bread flour,"I gave this a try and returned it. This is the all cast model, no plastic and built very solid but, the finest grind is not fine enough for bread flour which is what I wanted it for."
3,May need initial adjustment for fine flour,"When I first used mine the grind was neither fine nor consistent. On the finest setting from the factory, the results were much larger than corn meal. I had to adjust the burrs by removing and rotating the adjustment knob. After that it makes very fine flour. I've used it on both brown rice and pearled barley with good results.Use caution when grinding hard material like tapioca pearls, as the mixer can break one of its gears if the attachment clogs. I've had broken gears before, with other attachments, not just the grain mill, however replacement gears can be found for under $5."
5,Does exactly what it says,"Worth the money for anyone looking at a 2 gallon sprayer. No great myth here; works perfectly, does as it says, and it's sure to satisfy. Simple!"
2,Plastic trigger broke in no time.,"I like the way it worked for about a month. If you do a lot of quick triggering back to back, the plastic trigger locking part will break & you will have to chunk the whole thing or use some tie wire."
4,"Works great initially, but you need to get the replacement handle","Filled the tank multiple times and sprayed my whole backyard. One week later when I went to apply a second coat, the trigger handle started to pop off whenever I squeezed it. I contacted Chapin support and they are sending me the ""new, redesigned trigger handle"" - which makes me ask why they didn't just put it in the box in the first place."
1,Poorly constructed,"We were able to get one use out of this sprayer and then, like others have said, the cheap plastic hinges that hold the handle in place became broken/stripped; and once this happens, you can no longer use the handle to pull the piston/plunger out of the nozzle, which prevents the unit from being able to spray.I tried to save a few bucks, and it ended up biting me in the buttocks. Don't buy this item--the most important part of it is junk. Do yourself a favor go to an actual store and inspect their sprayers for integrity before you make a purchasing decision."
5,"Great product, which saved my boxwoods when all else failed!","This 2 gallon sprayer is SO great! Easy to use and effective, I was able to easily spray Neem oil on all of my shrubs and trees. I was able to save my boxwoods and roses from infestations that were so entrenched that I had almost given up on trying to save them!The first time I sprayed my shrubs, I had to keep mixing small batches and apply with an empty Spray 'n' Wash bottle. What a pain! Your arm gets really tired from all of the manual pumping. This sprayer is light weight, easy to use and clean, and works great! Someone who reviewed this before I purchased it recommended going over the markings in black sharpie so they are easier to read, which is absolutely necessary and a great idea!"
2,Check your order,The product description noted different spray patterns. Once the order arrived the instructions verified that different spray nozzles were included in the package. No spray nozzles were with the package. I notified the company of same. As of this date.....nothing. I will say that the sprayer itself would received 4 stars had it not been for customer service apparently blowing me off.
2,Air Leak,"Bought two. One works as intended, the other, no matter how much I tighten the pump/cap it still leaks air. Not sure what's going on. Would rate 2 1/2 stars if this option were available, since one works fine but the other doesn't."
3,ok for very light duty,hose is very small ... doesn't spray very much at at time ... think next time I'll go back to home depot ... this is a pretty disappointing sprayer ... hope it lasts for my one job I bought it for
3,2 gaallon sprayer,this is a good little sprayer-it just takes 5 or 10 minutes fooling with the trigger to get it to work. I would return it but need it daily in the greenhouse this time of year. I have reported it to Amazon twice to just send me a new trigger device instead of returning the whole sprayer-but no response.
5,Exceeded expectations,"Looks cheap. Is cheap. Works better than my $60 former sprayer. I'm buying a couple more and using each one for specific spray jobs. If I could give it 6 stars, I would."
1,"2-gal worked once, quit","Sprayer worked good -- once. Then couldn't get it to spray and couldn't get it to come apart per ""troubleshoot"" instructions."
2,Fragile system for opening and closing!,"I returned it. There are plastic tabs that ""catch"" when the plunger is fulled depressed, allowing you to unscrew the lid. Unfortunately these tabs aren't very durable and broke off mine after the first use. Maybe I got a lemon, who knows."
3,"Satisfactory product, sprayer hurts the hand","Purchased this product to do some spraying of 20% vinegar for organic weed control. I used the sprayer for about 2 gallons worth, and the day after my hand was pretty cramped up from holding the trigger down for so long.Pros: not too expensive, got the job done. Not too heavy even when full. Easy to use.Cons: apparently there is some lead content in the tip, so the instructions say to wash your hands after use. Might not have purchased this brand if I knew that in advance.Also, the first time I opened the top after the container was empty and still under pressure it sprayed me in the face. Lesson learned. Be sure to not stand directly over the container when opening.Also, if you're going to be using the product frequently (more than a couple of times a year) I would recommend springing for the more expensive model that has the lock on the sprayer so you don't have to squeeze it the entire time."
2,Heavy Duty???,"This worked fine for most of the summer -- maybe 6 uses. Then the housing cracked just below the trigger...it's all plastic, and not heavy duty plastic either. I tried to tape it but the air pressure blows another leak almost immediately. So now I have a good bottle and pump but the only replacement parts that come with the plastic housing needed is $14.99!! Reminds me of the Space Shuttle and the defective 'O' ring. A few lousy cents extra would have made all the difference."
1,Not a great sprayer,"Bought this one and then found a couple one and a half gallon at a local farm store.I used these for fertilizer&weed spray.They come with a shoulder strap,the Chapin does not,so it is awkard,does not spray as well, and more costly than others.Consider other ones,even small features make a big difference.I would not recommend this sprayer,but sprayers are the way to go if your hands tire out squeezing the trigger!Forgot to mention this sprayer clogs easily."
1,Too cheaply made for me,"I just received this sprayer today, and on taking it out of the box, I couldn't believe the cheapness to all of it. I don't mind a plastic tank, but the hose and control and nozzle are very thin gauge plastic. There is no vent to dump the pressure when you're done. I'm not sure if I will actually use it or return it, but this one really caught me by surprise. It's writeup on Amazon made it look of much higher quality, but this is not just junk but really cheap junk. I would not buy it if I had actually seen it in a store."
3,"Could have been better, but not terrible.","I have used this sprayer quite a bit. Not long after it's first use, I started having problems with where the squeeze handle meets the release valve. Whiles squeezing, sometimes it pops off and I have to push it back on before it will spray. I'm afraid it will probably break soon, but it does work very well except for the drawback."
3,Great and Okay,"The music is fabulous. There is no doubt about this. If you like Funk, it is definitely a must. My only complaint is that the production / remastering quality is not good on all the tracks. I guess it depends on what the original master tape sounded like but some of the tracks (especially the ones where theres a lot of talking / rapping) are not as clear or stereo separated and dynamic as others. Others have a lot of dynamism with clear bass and treble highs as well as separation of channels. I am overall happy, but it could have been better in the production / mixing / remastering."
5,Poetry that makes you feel alive,"This isn't the dry, highbrow stuff forced down your throat in high school. This is juicy, magical, alive and exciting. There is romance, myth, anger, fear and wonder.I've performed these poems to great effect, and had many people ask where they could get the book. I've heard it's coming back in print and that's tremendously exciting.Patricia Monaghan has written numerous books on Goddesses and myth, including the brilliant ""O, Mother Sun,"" and has another poetry collection, ""Winterburning."""
5,Bandsaw belts,What adifference these belts made on my saw. No more tracking problems or belts coming off.
1,Way over priced.,"Guess I should have read the reviews before ordering. Band saws have two tires both used equally so i paid $25. bucks for one tire, should have scrolled down the page and brough the red tires 2 for $29. or better yet gone to Rocker.I will not order this brand again."
4,A little disappointed..................,"I just recieved my movie the other day and sat down to watch it. I remember seeing the movie when it first aired and seeing far more of the mother's abuse. I remember her placing her hand on the stove, taking her to the doctors and saying she forgot to put a potholder on or something, also stepping on her fingers when she was trying to save her crayons. This version I recieved is not the uncut original version. Unless you know the whole story, it is hard to imagine just what she really went through . Did anyone else recieve this copy?"
5,Sybil,"Sally fields portrayed Sybil, a person with multiple personality disorder very well. She was very beliveable in this role. Opens your eyes to what physical and mental abuse can do to a child."
4,"Good ""Almost"" Classic",Rewatching this film really showed the depth of Sally Field's acting. Dvd was worth buying - would definitely recommend to over 40s crowd.
4,very good,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and we all watched together and everyone enjoyed it. I highly recommend this movie to those who are interested the syci."
5,It'a a great story,i thnik the movie is great... it's really really sad that this story is true. this is really good to know it too because you learn a lot about the illness and it's really good to see the movie and watch how sad a girls life can be and how there is peoploe intrested in helping!I can just say that i recomend this movie a lot really...
5,Fastastic,I'm currently enrolled at Rutgers University and am taking Abnormal Psychology. For two class periods we were shown this movie. I couldn't wait till the next class to watch the second part of the movie. I had to rent it and see for myself what happened. This is really a timeless story and great video for knowledge and entertainment.
5,A Great Movie & A true story!!,"This is a great movie starring Sally Field. This is a true story. Sally Field gives a wonderful performance as Sybil Dorsett, a young woman tormented with Twenty different personalities. Her Mother is a very sick woman, who's demented ways affect her only daughter so severally, that her mind is shattered into many different lives. She seeks help from a doctor Wilber, played by Joanne Woodward. (Another great actress). It took DR. Wilber 10 years to help Sybil find herself & put her life back together. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing one of the great movies of the 70's. This movie takes you on a journey through the mind of a split personality that you will never ever forget!!"
5,"Joyce's thoughts on the 30th anniv.special edition of ""SYBIL""","This DVD has been long overdue. Everything about it is five (5) stars. If you don't own it----What are you waiting for?? Order it today from Amazon.com; I promise you won't be disappointed!!Definately recommend this one to your family and friends and ""PASS IT ON!"""
5,My thoughts,"Finely acted story and brilliant movie. I had seen the TV adaption once before so viewing the whole movie was great. Having the 2nd DVD with the ""making of"" made this package so very special. The interviews done so long after the movie was made add to the timeless quality of this story line and the awesome acting."
5,Sybil,"Sybil, a disturbed young woman who suffers from multiple personality behavior. Living alone in a New York apartment, Sybil is tormented by flashbacks and visions of her extremely painful childhood. Unable to live a normal life, she meets Dr. Cornelia Wilbur (Joanne Woodward), a kindhearted psychiatrist who becomes committed to helping Sybil heal the incredible wounds that haunt her. This movie is inspiring and brutal drama, based on a real-life story. Sally Field gives an outstanding award-winning performance as Sybil."
1,bad video,"had scratches on it when I received it, kept locking up my DVD player, not good. It was purchased because I had to write a psychology term paper on it. I am not a happy camper."
5,Sybil,My daughter watched pieces of this for a college class. She was so interested she wanted to get it. I thought it would be hard to find but you made it easy.
4,sybil,A very good film on an important subject. Sally Fields really shines as the title character(s) as does Dan Petrie's excellent direction. Hard to believe that this was a MOW over thirty years ago.
4,Tragic Enlightenment,"Tragic EnlightenmentShort stories by Ted KiserISBEN: 0-595-23873-4...a review by Sarah MankowskiTragic Enlightenment is a fascinating and truly thought-provoking collection of short stories.The characters in these tragic vignettes are as varied as a lecherous inventor, a paroled rapist, a homeless alcoholic and police officer who must face her partner&#65533;s murderer.The stories span a variety of genres, but what they all have in common is elements of tragedy and loss that stimulate thought about the human condition.Scattered throughout the slim volume are intriguing illustrations from contributors Kristel Kula, Donald Kiser and Jennifer Adelman, which add yet another dimension to the work.Memorable stories; highly recommended."
2,Mistaken by the title...,"What can one say but, dont judge the book buy its cover. In my case (and everyone else who buys from amazon) i did exactly this, expecting too much, i was BITTERLY disapointed in the content of the book. I love scandanavian architecture and for some stupid reason the author decided to write a book on 20th Century architecture but left out the all important 1970 - 2000 buildings. The author focussed far too much on Pre-20th leading to. overall i hated the book. (the first one mind you ever! since purchasing from amazon in 5 years) If your interested in the background of swedish architecture then fine it's probably a great book, however if it's great design your after then this is certainly not the one!."
2,Do Not Get,"Almost no improvements in performance over the stock nvidia 5200 that was in my dual 1.8 G5 over the first several months, then constant overheating problems and finaly complete failure made this one of the most overpriced pieces of garbage I have ever purchased. I'm all for the ability to actually boost performace on a Mac, but if its going to be at such high prices for such bad results then I'm fine with just leaving my tower be."
1,delicate - damages easily. VERY noisy,"Put the device in cigarette lighter. After a moment, made a loud noise. Put car in drive, and Shift gear knocked against device. After that, the device made lots more noise, as the fan inside was dislodged. Now, the device is extremely loud, so I deem it worthless. Went and bought a laptop plug, which is what I should have done in the first place."
3,Problems holding pressure,"This thing is brand new and would not hold pressure at first -- it would leak out the top. I finally determined that you have to screw it on *really, really* tight to get it to work properly. I would suggest to Chapin that they develop a better gasket. Now that I know what is going on, it works pretty well."
4,Surprisingly good,"This small book is a gem. It was a surprise to know about this project and how well it has withstood time. Pity is not bigger, with more before and after pictures."
4,note,"good book, used but it seems new. The case study is an investigation by different points of view not only architectural and urbanistic . very interesting."
5,Everyone who owns a large macaw should have this book.,"""The Large Macaws"" is a behavioral and management, nutritional, and health-care guide -- as well as a history and an encyclopedia of well-and little-known facts about the biggest of all parrots (with occasional references to the mini-macaws). The book is lavishly illustrated; replete with tables and charts; and fully documented. The authors are among the world's leading experts on hyacinth and other large macaws. Highly recommended."
3,OK but lacking information in some areas.,"I expected to find everything I need concerning macaws in this book. I am a beginning breeder and was particularly interested in mating and courting behaviors but was disappointed in how little was addressed regarding this. It had information found in my other books but nothing additional.The rest of the book, care, health, housing etc. was well done."
3,Who Makes The Choices Of What Gets Released?,"I purchased this tape and found it cute, but I wonder why the owners with the rights to this series don't make all of the episodes available? They could even do themes for selling the tapes. My suggestion would be a vacation theme. Those particular episodes were some of the funniest shows of the series"
3,Good and Bad,"I was so excitied when I finally got it, but the DVD quality is bad. It skips one episode, so instead of 5 I got 4. Other than that, I was laughing the whole way through."
3,make ALL episodes available by the season!!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe that this long running, highly acclaimed and FUNNY show, is limited this way to fans.There are MUCH more and MUCH better 'best of' episodes.I'm seriously perplexed by the lack of availability of the entire series and have heard of no other plans for it in DVD release.One would wonder why."
3,Far from the best episodes of a great show,"Designing Women was an excellent, intelligent comedy, which had many, many great episodes. The ones selected for this disk, although very good, are not among the best. For example, none of the crazy closeness between the Suzanne and Anthony characters is shown (such as the episode when they are forced to share a hotel room in a blizzard or the episode when she coaches him on running for prom king).Also the technical quality of the disk is that of a VHS tape and not of a DVD. The resolution is mediocre at best.Buy this disk because even the mediocre episodes selected are a lot of fun to watch."
3,Need more...,This was good as some highlights of the show but it would be better to have the whole series available.
4,Great show,"I love the show, however, only 4 stars for this DVD - not the best selection of episodes and the quality is so-so, not digitally re-mastered, for sure. Either way, I enjoyed this DVD and really hope the entire show comes out on DVD soon.The Episodes: 1) Pilot 2) Killing all the right people 3) Reservations for eight 4) Big Haas and little falsie 5) They shoot fat people, don't they?"
2,not even close to the best,I really only think two of the five episodes shown are really that good. There were so many much better episodes. Why are these five the only ones available?
4,"A GREAT DVD,BUT STILL DISAPPOINTING","THIS IS THE BEST OF DESIGNING WOMEN OF 5 SHOWS, THEY WERE RIGHT WITH 2 OF THEM, ""BIG HAAS AND LITTLE FALSIE"" AND ""THEY SHOOT FAT WOMEN,DON'T THEY?"" ARE TWO OF MY FAVORITES.THE PILOT, KILLING ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE,AND RESERVATIONS FOR EIGHT ARE GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST. HOPE THEY DO A SEASON BY SEASON DVD SET."
3,Not Really The Best Of,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD. It only has 5 shows on it, and none of them were my favorites (it has the really sad episode of the young guy dying of AIDS - I don't like to cry during a sitcom!) However, they are The Designing Women, and I do love them just the same."
2,memory lane not always trustworthy,"Loved this show when it came out and was delighted to be able to get it. What was sharp, funny, edgy 15 or so years ago is not today. Still others may like the loud abrasive tone each episode brings. Mine is in the garbage"
1,A WASTE OF THE PRICE OF A BLANK CD!,"This cd makes me think that I've gone senile. I remembered this as a very funny show, but seeing these 5 episodes makes me wonder if my memory is faulty. If these are the best episodes, how could I have possibly thought that this was a funny show?"
1,I loved the series but not these episodes,I loved Designing Women and was looking forward to this DVD but I found that these episodes are all about the characters screaming at each other...not the best choice.
4,Want all the seasons! These aren't the funniest!,"I mostly posted this because I want someone with the production company to read this and see that they need to put out more! I used to tape this off of Lifetime in reruns in 1994-95. None of my VCR tapes are in such great condition any more, and my VCR jammed recently. The best shows are NOT on this DVD; we need a DVD of all the seasons-- at least until DB left the show. The shows on this ""Best Of"" DVD are kind of dramatic. My favorite shows are the ones that are a little less political, such as the one where MaryJo had to decorate a nudist colony, the one where Bernice is courted by the Sugarbaker's crazy client (the guy with the bowtie who thinks his TV is getting struck by lightning)and then competes in a senior home beauty contest, and the one where MaryJo and Julia go to a keg party and must give Charlene lessons on class by telephone while she visits Bill's uptight family."
5,RELEASE ALL EDPISODES--IT IS A MUST!!!,"As a dedicated and loyal fan of ""Designing Women"", I, too, think that the whole series should be release by seasons...while I think there were far funnier episodes than the ones chosen, I love them as well. My favorites include the trip with Suzanne and Anthony to St. Louis, the one where they all go to Design Expo in New Orleans, and my all time favorite episode when Julia gets jury duty. I have watched the show everyday for years on Lifetime and still laugh out loud at some of the best interaction between any group of actors. I love ""Designing Women""."
4,I WANTED MORE FROM THIS DVD,"I AM SPOILED! I LOVE MY DVD'S THAT HAVE EXTRAS IN THEM! TAKE ""FRIENDS"" EVERY EPISODE HAS SOMETHING NEVER BROADCAST ON TV! I AM HAPPY THAT THIS DVD IS OUT THERE BUT I WOULD OF LIKE TO HAVE SEEN INTRODUCTIONS BY THE CAST AND BY LINDA BLOODSWORTH THOMASON OR PLEASE LADIES AN AUDIO COMENTARY! IN 1990 I WAS AT THE MUSEUM OF BROADCASTING AND THEY SHOWED A 80 MINUTE REEL OF HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SHOW ( NOW EDITED DOWN TO 43 MINUTES FOR TV BROADCAST) THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT EDITION TO ANY FUTURE DVD RELEASES. THE 5 EPISODES ON THIS DVD ARE SOME OF THE BEST BUT NEXT TIME GIVE ME A SEASON! THE SHOW IS A CLASSIC AND TV NEEDS SHOWS LIKE THIS AGAIN!THE SHOW HAD AN OPINION AND WAS NEVER AFRAID TO GIVE IT! THE SHOW STILL HOLDS UP TODAY! WILL YOU EVER BE ABLE TO SAY THE SAME ABOUT ""BECKER"" OR ""KING OF QUEENS"" OR ""YES DEAR"" I DON'T THINK SO"
3,If only it were longer and the show was on DVD!,"I loved this show because growing up in the South I believe I know each and everyone of these ladies. Women from the South (true Southern women) are delicate, intelligent, and strong.I love these women and not just the characters!"
3,Light weight book,"Love seems unattainable to Lydia Greenville after her failed Season on the Ton. Coming home to social obligations and recriminations drives her into the woods for solace in her sketching. There she meets a rumpled young man who immediately charms her, but she thinks his social status is below hers, so it can't work-- or can it. As it happens, her woodland knight is not a peasant but a Duke. Though at first infuriated by the deception, Lydia's heart overcomes her outrage in time.*** With this light weight book, the Regency fan will be well pleased. It fits the formula of this romance very neatly. ***"
4,"Very much like the ""old"" Old Timers","If you put this knife in a time machine and sent it back to 1995, I think it would blend right in. The markings on the blade have changed subtly, but the quality is very similar to the old US-made Schrades. This knife was good and sharp, right out of the box, and I'd say it's about as sharp as the old Schrades were. Not ridiculously, scary sharp, but plenty sharp. It shaved hairs off my arm just like the old ones.The joint is a little stiff and drags a little. I think a drop of oil would cure that problem. That's the worst complaint I can make. Most of the ""new"" Schrades I've tried have been disappointing, but this one certainly isn't. A good value in a pocket knife. Made in China."
1,poor service,"placed order on 9/15/11 and today is 9/26/11 and still have not received product and emails, nothing. I have sent an email for a status but nothing rcvd yet...very poor customer service at this point."
5,France - The future of electronic music,"Hidden somewhere behind the shockwave from Daft Punk, Air entered the music scenes all over the world as light and gentle as thier music. Many of you out there have probably never heard of Air, and this will unfortunately continue to be the case. But if you ever get the chance to listen to Moon Safari, don't hesitate. This spectacular and absolutely brilliant form of modern electronic music will surely capture everyone's heart."
2,NO COMMENT,So So CD !!!Bought it for one piece of music and enjoy that.The other songs are mundane at best.Good for a Goodwill donation.John
4,Its great for the $$$$,"Look, its plastic... If you are on a budget, this fits well, and looks original.... BUT you need to add the front spoiler brackets or make some up out of steel stock. Dont expect to bolt on and go. It would not last long-as the other reviewer said. Thats why they sell the kit."
3,Smooth Jazz,"I pretty much bought this for one artist on it, Chris Standring. It is a pleasant CD, not great, but enjoyable."
4,Haven't used these yet,They did arrive on time and are a nice quality. I plan to make mini Key lime tarts recipe I found in the book Petite Sweets.
3,Soup/Cereal Bowl could have a better design,Overall I love the Villeroy & Bock Switch-3 design. But I feel that the Soup/Cereal bowls could be greatly improved. The biggest problem is that the soup bowls do not stack well thus taking up a lot of room in the cupboards or posing a fall risk if you try to stack more than one on top of another.Another issue for some is the small size. They are a great size for my young kids but too small for my husband and I. We are thinking of adding the rice bowls to our set to see if they would work better (we have the rimmed bowls but they are too shallow for cereal).
3,Did not fit my car,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQB6RQ/ref=ox_ya_os_productThis product did not fit my car.Because I damaged it trying to fit it,I can't return it, and don't expect a refund.I just want seller to check fitting information.It was about 7mm too long to fit."
2,Not the boot for me,"These boots were most uncomfortable. I am not sure if they were too high (I have other boots this tall) or too narrow or what the problem was. I sent them back because there was no way I was walking to my car in them let alone wear them all day. They are nice to look at but not good to wear. I normally wear a 7 1/2 but got the 8 to allow for room, they were long enough but very uncomfortable. Sorry Jessica."
4,Bought a second one after 4+ years of use,"Actually, the FIRST one is still running GREAT. We needed a second one in our guest bathroom and I searched for the exact same model. What we like about this dryer is:1) it's kind to one's ears2) has all the heat setting one could possibly need, plus a ""cool"" button for brush styling3) the filter on the back pops off for cleaning, which is FANTASTIC. Great engineering design in this regard.4) it's light-weight"
1,Poor grammar makes reading very hard,"I just read through the first section of this book, and it left me with a terrible headache due to what I would deem an unacceptable amount of grammatical errors. Perhaps if the text were to be revised, this could make a decent textbook, but as is, it should not be used to teach a course."
1,Careful,"Maybe it's just because this was used for an Intro to Mechatronics course in my Junior year, but I found this book totally useless. The explanations of how certain actuators/sensors work are about three sentences long, followed by 200 equations. The only reason I understood anything from this book is thanks to Wikipedia.If you already know about all this stuff, maybe this book is a good reference, but if you are trying to learn it for the first time, good luck.Also, I just thought that I'd point out that the 4 positive reviews for this book are from Illinois -- that is coincidentally where the author is from as well. That may explain their enthusiastic reviews of this book."
1,Light weight,"Barbara Kahn is a marketing professor at Wharton but I hear only because her husband Robert J. Meyer is also a chaired marketing professor in the same department. She wrote a ""quantitative"" dissertation for her PhD but Kahn actually is a touchy-feely behaviorist who works on variety-seeking behavior, a very trivial topic in marketing ignored by all serious researchers. She knows nothing about quantification by her own admission. She also says her dissertation was written entirely by her supervisor and not by her, my Wharton friends tell me. This background, or rather, the lack of any background, is reflected in her book. The book falls seriously short of its promise and reads like an alphabetical soup. Don't waste your money on this book when there are much better books available on amazon.com. Better still don't waste your time on this book. It's an IQ-reducer and will leave you dumber and more confused."
3,My review :),"Hi. I read some of the book when I took Professor Kahn's Mktg 101 class. (for those of you in the class, not much was on the test about this book). Anyway, although it was recommended for ""Anyone who shops"" I shop practically everyday and grew up shopping often at grocery stores, but did not find the book to be a good read. I consider myself relatively well educated in business related literature as I took the class during my senior year at Penn's Wharton school. There seemed to be too much academic information which distracted me from enjoying the book and getting a lot our of it. For people on Prof. Kahn's level of marketing expertise this book is likely to be very useful, but it is not as useful to undergrads in Marketing 101 or to the general population."
4,Useful Framework,"Brace & Hinckley's work provides a relevant and useful framework for understanding the interdependencies of popularity, policy, perception and politics and thier importance vis-a-vis the American presidency ---- a must read for citizens and the Obama administration."
5,Wonderful resource,"I'm so pleased with this book. It's a great resource for stories and ideas for sharing Buddhism with children. My favorite was the detailed Lovingkindness meditation to share at bedtime, a lovely practice among many in the book."
3,surprised doesn't lock,"I bought this for my 22 month old daughter to use in the kitchen to color while I cook or clean up. She does like it and uses it. HOwever, I was surprised that when folded up, it doesn't lock. If you touch it, it slides partially open. It can't be carried in the folded position easily because it doesn't stay closed."
2,Little tikes play table,"I'm still waitting for my second LIttle Tikes Easy Store Jr. Play Table.... I don't understand why if I bought 2, you only send me ONE!!!!! Went I already paid for TWO Tables!!!!!!!!"
3,My kid finally sits and eats again instead of being held.,"My 19 month old toddler son would not sit in a high chair after moving to the toddler room some time ago at KinderCare Learning Center. They sit at little tables with chairs 4 their meals. Well, this table came in handy 4 just that reason. It's durability is still to be found out. My son is definately a rough one so only time will tell. We just purchased it 4 Christmas."
4,Watch out for durability,"My 30lb 18 month old son got this for Christmas and loved it -- BUT -- he is a climber, and the first thing he learned to do was to scoot it up against the kitchen counters and climb on top of the table. Since he figured that out, he's tried to use it more as a ladder than a table. I used the bench seat once as a step ladder myself, only to completely collapse the table and to spring the latches enough to make it forever unstable....so now I have a nice table that I won't let my son use anymore. Shopping around again!"
2,Hard to install,"My husband and I were extremely disappointed in the construction of this table. Eventhough the majority of the parts were already assembled, the latches were hard to ""lock""; on one side, you could not bear down at all to snap the latch into place. It took my husband and me several attempts and we almost broke the latch! Finally, with me actually sitting on the table leg (to apply some weight) and using all the strength my husband could muster, we were able to finish assembling the table.Thankfully, our efforts were not in vain-our 3 year old loves to sit at her new table."
5,Rave review,This table and bench was so easy to set up!! and it's bright and colorful -- attractive to children. The size is just right and will continue to be of use for a long time. Appears to be very durable as well.
2,Ebay material,"My daughter got this table for Christmas. I thought it was going to be great for her. We had limited space and I liked the idea of her having a table her size. Well I was wrong, during Playdates I could only fit 2 children at the table. Several times the children fell back and hit their heads or they would trip. The worse part is that it was hard to keep anything on the table. The top angles down and the drinks would slide right off. bad table and bad investment."
3,It's smaller than you may think,"I am writing this review because I want make sure that you understand that this table is not comfortable for an average sized toddler. My daughter weighs just about 30 pounds and this table was uncomfortably small for her. It's a cute table and it seems a reasonable purchase to keep from having to buy the large one, but it is quite small. My daughter was able to fit her legs underneath, but when she tried to move, she almost fell. There was no room for movement. I bought the larger picnic table and am quite pleased with it. My daughter has plenty of room to grow and it's a great starter tablewhere she can both eat and draw. My other suggestion...go to Toys R Us (which is what I did) to try out both."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this table for my 2 year old son because it looked durable and could be easily stored. The reviews I read said it was easy to put together. Although all you need to to to set it up is to push the two red brackets into place, it is extremely hard to do. The second day I tried to set it up for my son, one of the red plastic brackets broke."
3,Great toddler table!,"I've had this table for about 3 years now and it's still in absolute perfect condition. It's even been stored on our back porch over one winter and in the spring I just washed it off and it was as good as new. It folds up flat, but I've only done that once. It's a good sized table for 1-5 year olds. My sons have spent many picnics on it! Highly recommened!"
2,Not exactly...,"We thought this table was bigger than it is. Once we got it, we were a bit disappointed. It's not at all feasible to have 4 kids sit at it and that's really what we thought. You could have 2 kids sit across from each other but otherwise, it's too small. Our kid is a regular sized kid who is almost 3 and he takes up more than half of one side. If I could do it over again, I would and get something larger."
3,Get the larger version,Buy the larger version of this table. It has so much more leg room for when the kids get bigger and is SO worth the extra money!! Durability is excellent! Super easy to clean.
4,Only one complaint - it's not flat.,"There's a lot to like about this table. It's very stable for toddler climbing, just the right size for small spaces, and is durable. My only complaint is that the top is not flat. I returned the first one thinking it was damaged in shipping, but the second one is the same. We kept it because our 15-month old daughter does not seem to care. She still likes stacking things on it even though they slide around a bit."
3,Perfect for two kids,"Great for the backyard or indoors. Children do not fuss as much compared to separate table and chairs. Although, collapsible, can easily fit in a larger size vehicle without folding down. Crayon marks or markers can be easily removed with Goo Gone. Recommend up to the age of five, otherwise not enought leg room underneath."
3,Not very durable,"Collapsed in the middle of my daughter's birthday party. 3 children were sitting at it -- a 2 year old, a 3 year old, and a 5 year old. Maybe that was too much weight, but these are not giant kids. Just standard size. I was very surprised, because my experience with Little Tikes is that their stuff is virtually indestructable. Oh well."
1,A/V Sync issues ruin this disc,"I agree with the commenter who raised this issue: the last (and best) third of the performers here (Al Green -> Solomon Burke) are impossible to enjoy if you're bothered by mismatching between audio and video.Also, uou will pay Amazon for shipping after realizing this & deciding to send it back."
2,Sound to Video sync mismatch - you got to be kidding me (???),"How could such a wonderful concept be ruined by such a stupid sound to video sync mistake.Most songs appear to sync. Al Green & Mavis Staples does not sync and they're the highlights of the video (??).""Buyer beware""..."
1,Scrabble for the Mac,"According to the Amazon.com information, this version of Scrabble was for Win 95, win 98, and ME, plus Mac OS. What I got was for Win 3.1, and Win 95, plus Mac. It would not load on my Mac I BOOK, OSX. I think this is a very old, old, version and not made to work on Mac OSX. I rated it a ""1"" because I can't load it, therefore can't use it."
1,Scrabble,This release is so old that it can only be played on a machine where the video card will go down to the 256 color mode. It is useless on a modern machine.
2,WARNING!!! Don't buy this game.,"I purchased this game for my Mac, however when it arrived...it wouldn't load because it's an old version and it isn't supported any longer. When I called Hasbro to see if there were downloadable updates, I was informed that this game is out of their system and it is no longer supported. This isn't just for Macs, it's for ALL computers. This bums me out since I love playing this game."
4,Older Version of Scrabble,"I was so happy to find this older version of Scrabble. I had purchased Scrabble Complete and did not find it satisfactory at all. The board was not as large and was much harder to see. I do not like the fact that obsolete, foreign, and other unlikely words are accepted. I would like an option that allows me to omit these words from the game and just use words in common usage. The game can be fun, but things like this make it frustrating!"
1,Outdated Scrabble Game,The old Scrabble game will not load into a modern Apple (Mac) computer.The game is for an old 1995 Macintosh.Hitgaming Video Games indicated they know little about Apple computers.The game is worthless.
2,An old version,"This is an old version of scrabble. The graphics aren't great and it isn't easy to access definitions and hints. The scrabble player's use of words in expert are so uncommon, they make for an uninteresting game."
5,"nice patterns you'd actually want to wear, and it's easy to use!","colorful, concise book full of lots and lots of beautiful, flattering, contemporary garments and accessories. no frumpy leaflet sweaters in cheap, garish yarns here...i especially appreciate the spiral lay-flat binding, and the stitch diagrams as an enrichment to the text patterns. big photos of both projects and 100% scale views of the sample yarns also make life easier. good reference section at the beginning, and the text is nothing more than you need (and clearly written).the only drawback to this book is that the patterns for the lovely little tanks and tops will need to be altered or enlarged for women with larger bustlines, but a little math and experimenting with your gauge will fix that! the handbags, shawls, and scarves are great places to start if you are a beginner (or returning crocheter) and want a thrilling new fast project to work on."
5,user friendly,"I consider myself an intermediate crocheter and this book has projects I can make. The instructions are very comprehensive and include charts as well as written instructions. level of difficulty is indicated also. The spiral binding is very useful too. I like especially the Moroccan slippers, cloche hat, stole, cardigan and shawl. I ordered this book sight unseen and was very pleasantly surprised with it."
4,very nice designs for smaller people,"If you're making for smaller people this is great. I made 2 tops for my daughter.I,however need more coverage. Loved the designs and fairly easy to work.definitely would buy again.people saw me doing these and offered me money to do for them.I've found a second income!"
3,Under Outlaw Flags,This is written competently as a historical account of WW1 aerial combat. You can become engaged with the characters and the book will keep you interest. However it does follow the usual plot lines and though engaging not overly exciting just a nice Sunday afternoon and coffee type read.
4,Can't beat Reasoner,Good story line can't beat James Reasoner for keeping you interested ! Good story line I highly recommend this book!!
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'm a big fan of Frankie Ruiz music! I listen to this CD all the time in my car. Whatever happened to Salsa music now? When I hear this beautiful harmony it really makes me want to go back to Puerto Rico. My favorite song is BAILANDO. Is about a man meeting a woman he's attracted to at the dance floor. His eyes where only for her. A very sexy song! If you are a salsa lover this CD is worth every penny to own!
2,"Tastes good, but is allergenic","I have soy-corn-gluten allergies, and this product gives me a strong allergic reaction - I get edema (swelling) from it. For those with allergies - it is unsafe to use. For people who don't have allergies - may be a good product."
3,Rain umbrella,"The handle is too short, and my dog is scared of it, so far we haven't been able to get our dog to walk well with it. I am 6 feet tall, and I think the handle needs to be adjustable. I ordered 1 and you sent 2. I sent the other one back. Postage was $4.95. Someone needs to send me a check for the returned item"
4,The Champs,"I loved this video. It reminded me of the fun I had when I visited Paris, twice. The Champs, as the true Parisiennes call it, was one of my favorite places to shop, sightsee, and people watch. This video allows me to relive my visit to Paris and the Champs Elysees over and over again. It's a great video for anyone who plans to travel to Paris."
1,Quelle disappointment!,"No super photography here. Minimal history. And future Oscar winner Halle Berry struggles to try to give the banal script some life. I thought watching this video would trigger fond memories of my visit to Paris and teach me a little something besides. No such luck. I hope the other videos in the ""Great Streets"" series are better this one. Rent, don't buy, this one."
4,After all these years! Sam still has it going on!!!,"How many have been to the festival all 3 days? I am glad to see Sam finally do a DVD on his live performance's. The crowd in the show is a little subdued which the band feeds on. I find the Live! Sam Bush Shows the most exhilirating when he is playing the bar scene and not in a quiet theatre, which this reminds me of. Good loud mix on the banjo with Scott Vestal and Sam's playing, etc. The overall mix seems to be a little weak, good choice of material and the interviews are good as well. I wish this would have been an outdoor concert venue instead. Now Sam just needs to release some old live footage of the New Grass Revival day-2 DVD set from early years to 1989 when the actual band split, that would be a gold mine..Tim"
4,Christmas CD,"I bought it for one song -- How Should A King Come. However all the Christmas songs are beautifully done and I will enjoy it a lot, but it is not the version of How Should A King Come that I wanted -- one they used to play on the radio years ago. It would have been nice to hear introductory segment like you can on some CDs."
4,I liked the book.,"My son David is looking for places to go to school. Because of the extremely expensive tuition in the US, we decided as a family that he should go abroad. But where to look? We found this one through amazon.com and are very happy with it. It gives everything - good reccomendations, good insights and as reluctant parents it allowed us to compare between the Fisk's and Princeton Review guides for US universities and this one European schools. Parents - there is hope outside America which won't break your back financially - buy the book and find out."
3,Worth Collecting,Definitely worth collecting. An old school chop sockey. Low on sense and plot. Good picture but not remastered. Not Ms Mao's best work but not the worst movie she's ever been in either. Do not buy this movie to see Sammo Hung though he's barely in it near the end of the movie in his typical bad guy-henchman role.
5,Thanks,The book arrived on time and as advertised. I do not like that eBay tells me how many words to write.
5,beautiful Scottish music,"Auld Lang Syne is my favorite song on this cd, but all the music is terrific. I heard this version of Auld Lang Syne (the nicest version in my opinion) on the movie Sex and the City. I looked it up on the movie soundtrack and wanted to know who sang it, and after some research found this cd with the exact recording in the film. I bought the whole cd for the one song, but the entire album is wonderful Scottish songs. A very enjoyable purchase, with beautiful singing."
4,"Nano!,Nano!(Apologies to MORK and MINDY!)","I wanted a good,challenging game that got you involved right from the get go.Nano breaker does not disappoint!Lots of slicing and dicing your enemies(If you,re into that sort of thing,I know I am!)and lots of challenging levels.I still have not finished the game,(I'm in no hurry,i'm taking my time on purpose!)learning the combo moves is a game in itself!With all of these era games coming out,i'ts good to know there are still good highly engrossing genre games like NANOBREAKER still out there for our enjoyment.I hope there is a NANOBREAKER for ps3 in the future, and I hope that Amazon is selling it!Keep up the good work!"
1,Godawful,"This game has horrible story, graphics, and gameplay. Music and sound effects are extremely generic. From the first moment you play it is just poor looking constant gratuitous violence."
5,Sturdy toy,"After one month, this ball is reasonably intact which is nothing short of a miracle considering Mazy, our German wire hair pointer mix, has reduced a Kong to a pile of rubber pieces in the past in short order. She has managed to take a few bites out of the ball and does like playing with it. This is just about the only toy that has held up except for the Nylabones. I recommend it for dogs who are ""rippers and shredders"" like Mazy."
5,Dogs love 'em!,I have to big labs and these are the only balls they can not destroy. It is their favorite toy. The only ones I buy now.
5,Awesome,My retired police dog chews on this all the time and he has yet to put a hole in it or tear it apart. We have had it for about 3 weeks now.
2,"ditto, music fan from chicago","I wholeheartedly agree with the previous 2-star post. This CD (along with the Supremes CD) is a grand collection of historic R&B music spoiled by seemingly unprofessional mixing and EQ work. The result is a mid-frequency heavy mix plagued with overloaded sounds. For anybody who is interested in bass guitar, the poor sound quality often makes it harder to listen to Jamerson. Look for other albums/compilations."
2,"Good collection, atrocious sound","This is a great selection of Four Tops music, but the sound is atrocious. It is harsh, brittle, and sounds like there is a lot of jitter in the mastering. I've tried it on 4 different cd players and the sound sucked on all of them. If you truly enjoy the smooth sound of the Four Tops, this isn't the cd to listen to that sound. Remastered? Must of been amateurs. Too bad."
5,"Great songs,Great Music,Great Lyrics","Everything Great. I love all of the music, lyrics, and songs. Its GREAT!"
4,Nails in the grass,"The sweeper arrived in good shape and went together easily and I eargerly took it outside, after coming home from work, to begin picking up nails from a recent re-roofing job. Grass that is taller than the bar will dislodge nails, etc....so I found myself clearing off the bar every time I heard the 'click' of another nail being attracted to the bar; this worked but I didn't cover as much ground as I had hoped before it got dark. Although the bar is height adjustable, this requires one to take a wrench to unlock hex nuts and retighten in order to adjust to the current grass level. It would be great to have a system wherein the height could be adjusted 'on the fly' and not have to stop, find the wrench, and adjust both ends independantly, depending on the changing grass height."
3,"Strong Magnet Gets It All, Handle Connection Poor","Have used this just shy of 1 year. Strong magnet picks everything up.Would like a quick adjustment for height. Around job sites with uneven ground, it can bottom-out and pull nails off magnet. A design that allows one to lift the magnet body relative to the ground at the handle on the fly.Handle connection to magnet body is sloppy. Plan on drilling more holes or welding handle to body permanently."
3,okay for the money,"This is a pretty good product, not as good as one I had rented in the past but cost less than three rentals so it is a decent bargain. The only real thing I wish different is the wheels should be easier to adjust."
4,Works Great,"Magnetic sweeper works very well on even ground. Wheels are small to keep the magnet close to the ground so it sometimes bottoms out on uneven ground. Won't pull nails, etc out of wet clay, but still works like a champ collecting all the nails and screws the construction guys 'lose' on the ground. I swear they are too lazy to bend over an pick up anything they drop - just leave it where it is."
4,Excellent Intro to Vineyard Worship Music,"Brenton Brown, Kathryn Scott, Brian Doerksen, Marc James ... these folks can both write and perform praise and worship songs. This collection is a very strong condensation of their work from the last few years. The new song, ""Comfort Me"", is another powerful addition.Also highly recommended - the Vineyard CD ""Hungry""."
3,Probably Not What You Remember,"If you remember the monkeys shouting ""Boil That Dust speck"" you might be disappointed with this video. It is not the original animated short you remember but in fact is a 94 remake. This is more accurately, ""Dustin Hoffman reads Horton"". Instead of real animation it is still pictures from the book with minor animation effects. My daughter still likes it, but it's not what I expected."
2,Very Disappointing,"There was no tipoff in the Amazon description telling me that this video was only moderately animated. I remember a fully animated version from when I was a kid and this was not it. My little boy, who loves being read the story, didn't care very much for this.Hoffman's character accents kept changing throughout his narration. The audio quality was muffled and sometimes hard to understand.Personally, I don't understand why this format of animation is even used. Except that you can put your kid down and walk away, there is no heightening of the experience over simply reading the book.I gave it a second star because it is a terrific book and the video presentation of the book can't be all bad based purely on the subject matter.If the fully animated version is available, that would be my preference."
2,Bad!,"If you want to see the classic ""Horton Hears A Who"" in it's full glory, then you do not want to buy this! Instead, I suggest that for just a couple dollars more, you purchase the double feature of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" which includes the original Horton and all ""Boil that dust speck"" excitement (which I still find exciting at 15.....scary) Plus you get to watch the Grinch! I know for a fact that you can buy it on this site because I currently own it. :)"
2,Glad I ordered 2 because one came with 4 holes in it!,New out of the bag one of the 2 I ordered had 4 holes in it. The other holds water but seams appear weak and plastic is very thin.
4,better than most,"for carrying water back to the boat, these are the best choice! The handles are part of the mold, not an attached piece like some others- and the ones with the attached handles always break and rust. Used it for a year so far and no mold problems. 1 of 3 got a tiny pinhole leak but is still useable- otherwise I would have given it a 5-star."
2,Leaky,"I used this water carrier two times during camping trips. On the second trip, as we drove up to our camping spot, the carrier leaked about a gallon of water into the back of my car. It appeared to have leaked out of the nozzle, despite it being in the ""closed"" position. The water jug was upright and had no weight on top, although there was some slight pressure from the sleeping bag next to it pressing against it. I feel that the valve should be strong enough to protect against this type of pressure without major leaks all over my car."
4,Got as Wedding Gift,Can't wait to use this. We actually got two of these (the clear and this blue one) for when we go camping. it's make of good materials and it was delivered to us in a very timely manor
3,Not as solid as it should be,"We're ready to go camping tomorrow, so I just filled out my brand new water carrier with water, just to realize it came with a hole in it!I liked that it comes from Canada (not China!!!) and has no PBA but with holes, it's completely useless.We ordered 2, I'll check out the 2nd container and update the review.Update: the 2nd container doesn't seem to have holes and the company that sold it promptly refunded our money for the defective container. So I would recommend this product if you're lucky to get one with no holes, I'm not sure how long the good one is going to last, the product seems like it may break at some point where it folds."
4,"So far, so good","I use this for car camping where I just need to have potable water close to the camp kitchen for cooking & drinking. This fit the bill. At first I thought it was kind of flimsy but after a trip to the Adirondacks with a big brute of a teenager and a set of rambunctious twins this jug held up well even after taking a tumble or two. I didn't have any leaks either to I'm pretty happy with it. I wouldn't rely on something like this for really rough trips (it's too heavy when full anyway). So far I've used it on three separate camping trips and at this price, feel I've gotten my money's worth."
2,Simple concept that can (and was) ruined by product quality,"As with several other reviewers, one of my two bags arrived with a hole in it. Doesn't do much good when it leaks!"
4,does what it's supposed to do.. but leaks a little at nozzle,"Working as expected. Material feels durable but leaks a little at the nozzle. So when storing, set it so nozzle is not facing down."
1,Worthless,I bought two of these for a recent excursion. Filled one before leaving civilization. It leaked 2 1/2 gallons in the back of the car before I got to my destination. I transferred the remaining 2 1/2 gallons into the other container at camp. It developed a leak the first night.
1,save your cash,"Bought two of these for a trip to Yosemite NP. Both leaked. Fortunately, we had also brought other supplies of drinking water. Next time I'll fork out the big $ for a Platypus instead of risking being left without potable water."
1,"Skip this one, unless you like patching holes!","Upon using it for the first(!) time, I discovered three pinholes along the lines where the jug was folded. Duct tape did the job, but after the camping trip I put this item straight into the dumpster."
1,Leaky water carrier,I read the reviews prior to purchasing this product and was on the fence. I saw both sides to what was written. Now after purchasing the water carrier I wish I would have wasted my money on something else. The product came in a simple plastic package. No instructions on how to clean it. I had to look online for that. Also after cleaning it and filling it with water it was awkward to carry and felt like it was going to burst open at any minute. Though it did not. I tightened the top properly and set it in my car. By the time I was home it had already leaked all over my back seat. I put it in the house and there it leaked again. Placed it outside and propped it up different ways to see if the issue was pressure but it is a bad designed product. Please do not buy this. I wish I could get my money back and purchase a different carrier.
3,Time will tell,"This is the second one I have bought, the first one sprung a leak when the cat knocked it off the counter and may or may not have chewed on it. I was happy with it up until then. If this one springs a leak I will not be buying a third."
2,Not as pictured,"I needed a reasonable looking USB extension for my media centre so I bought this one. There were two photos of the product at the time of purchase, both different and when mine arrived it didn't look like either of them. I was expecting the female end to have a white face but it didn't. Since I bought it specifically based on the photo I was pretty annoyed. Other reviewers mentioned that the product wasn't as pictured but as images get changed it's hard to link the review to the current image. If you were tempted by the design of this product look elsewhere as you too may well get something different."
4,Make your USB Hub a little neater,"This cable serves a very useful function, allowing your work area to remain fairly neat. By using the extension cable you can have your USB wires away from the computer and looking neater at the same time. The cable is handed, so in my case works better on the left side of my laptop. If your USB's are only on the right side of your laptop, you may want to consider one of the other right angle products such as a flexible elbow available from Amazon.What the Tripp Lite Right angle extension cable does very nicely is eliminate a big loop of USB cable, so if you have a small work area you're not fighting for space. In my case even though I have more than enough USB ports on the laptop I wanted them all on one connector so when I travel with the laptop, I only have one USB cable to remove.It's worked out well."
3,One Side only,This is not a left right adapter. It only works for the left side of a laptop. It would be ideal if the USB male side swiveled.
5,perfect for laptop in a tight space,I had a laptop docked in a tight space and needed to be able to plug in several USB devices. This fit the bill and worked as I'd hoped to get front USB access to ports in the side of the laptop.
3,Right angle orientation,"I didn't notice from the picture, but the right angle orientation is not useful for my application. When used with most towers with vertical usb ports, this cable is directed upwards, which isn't useful; plus it blocks the dvd drive. The mfg should offer a companion product with the opposite orientation (such as the HDE USB 3.0 Right Angle Male to Female Cable ) Otherwise the product looks well made, reasonably priced."
2,"Furmiture maybe, your thousand dollar guitar no","Bought this to use on my instruments and even gifted some (without trying it first) to fellow musicians. In the end, down the road, we all confessed that we reverted back to the home method (cloth baby diaper and Pledge). We found the cloth on this product a wee bit course, the ointment smells but does nothing to remove prints in a single wipe, and it definitely does not leave a protective coating of anything like the 'home' method does. There are way better products for furniture and guitars as musicians and furniture people would attest, this was simply a cheap attempt to have a handy gizmo that backfired."
4,Delivers on the action front.,"And what else does on want with a film like this. It has the usual ""humorous"" element stuck in with the voilence and melodrama that viewers of Hong Kong films of this era will be well familar with.The only real questions to my mind with these films is; is the action any good, and is there any originality in it? To both of these the answer is a resounding yes, with the sword fight providing the standout moment. Anyone who enjoyed Donnie Yen's more recent work, such as Flashpoint, should enjoy this."
2,buyer beware!,"Whatever you do as a customer who would like to purchase one of these stabilizers, DO NOT deal directly with Carter. THe Customer Service Department will gladly take your order, bill your account, and when your stabilizer does not show up . . . .they will give you a run-around that will last for weeks. Purchase from a reputable retailer like Amazon, Rockler, or WoodCraft. These retailers are in the business of pleasing thier customers so they return again and again. Carter does not share this practice! Buyer beware!!"
2,What a Disappointment!,"I have really enjoyed all of the other books that I have read by Liz Carlyle. That said, I was very disappointed in this one. The author relied on the three most stale, overused, unsatisfying plot movers: the main characters not communicating, the main characters arguing, and a secret baby. The story was boring and slow. I ended up skipping ahead almost to the ending; I cared about what happened, since Ms. Carlyle never fails to create interesting characters, but I couldn't make myself read the hundred or so pages it would have taken me to get there. I reread One Little Sin just prior to reading this book and boy did this one suffer in comparison! I hope she can find something fresh for the end of this trilogy."
1,Need a refund,"I have read every book by this author. I have enjoyed reading her books several times over, but I have to agree with some other readers. It was awful. There was absolutely no character developement, no tension. Only anger, anger, anger, and arguing and over reacting by both main characters. The heroine lied from the beginning of the novel up until the very last page! Never would she admit to the hero that she truly loved him until the end. I too, skipped many pages because their constant arguing became very tiresome. Skip this book and read ""No True Gentleman"" or ""Woman Scorned"" or anything else! I want a refund!"
