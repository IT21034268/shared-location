2,Too much pop,"Peter Hammill has made approaching 50 solo and VDGG albums in his impressive career. There are however half a dozen of them which should be avoided; this one is the very lowest point. Sure, you will find three of four great tracks here but the rest is bad pop."
4,Shot at my heart,"OK, call me an incurable romantic, but who wants to be cured anyway? Nils' 'Valentine' off Silver Lining had been the song of his that had most reached me until I heard 'Shot at You'. And if you like either of them, well, they're not on his Acoustic Live CD, but that's superb too. Enjoy."
5,Long-Awaited Gentle Giant Release Worth The Wait!,"What a beautiful job they did on this long-awaited Gentle Giant release. Not only is the remastering superb, but the packaging replicates the original ""3-D"" design of the album cover...complete with textured outer sleeve. But the real treat is the music inside, considered by many to be the band at its peak. In many ways, the tight, sophisticated and creative arrangements on ""Glass House"" remind me of ""The Yes Album."" If you're not familiar with Gentle Giant, this release is highly recommended. It's a perfect appetizer as you ""acquire the taste."""
4,"decent album, bad sound quality","I'm pretty sure I bought the import cd, and it sounds very tinny. So much so that the glass shattering break into the first song is migraine inducing. As for the album itself, I place it somewhere behind free hand and the power and the glory. The concept is great, but it is a bit uneven."
4,problem,"The KV 8400 series full extension precision ball bearing spring loaded slides, self closing drawer slides our carpenter installed operate very smoothly, but I do not know why I have to tug at the drawer to get it to open.If you have any advice I would appreciate hearing it.Thank you."
3,"construction seems good, not a full sized queen",We just finished putting this together. The wood is good quality. The instructions and construction are good. The size of this bed frame is- 57 1/2 inches wide and 76 inches long- not the standard 60x80 for a queen. The Serta queen sized futon mattress fits well.Rolling it up into a couch is easy. The back of the couch is surpisingly tall since it is larger than a typical sofa back-
5,Fast shipping.,Bought this as a gift for my nephew. It arrived quickly and was an easy set up for him. He is very happy with it.
4,Hardwood Futon Frame,"This came via quick delivery and everything was in good condition. I did not realize, however, how low it is to the ground - more for a teen or young person's room than a guest bedroom. The back legs slant, so it's deceiving. When opened to a bed, it is better but far lower than a standard bed set. I stained it using a cherry stain, and it looks nice. It seems very sturdy. I'm having company soon and will test it on them."
3,Really small,I have purchased this pendant years ago and still own it today. It's a small pendant and the diamonds are not that sparkly.
3,Miss Clarkson's Classmate,"Emily Clarkson's mother is not good at commitments, not to her daughter, and not in promise keeping. So, when the older woman takes off for America, she leaves Emily to keep her obligation to teach at Daniel Lennox's mill school. Recently, a group of children was orphaned in a tragic accident, and Daniel has taken over their care. Emily and Daniel's relationship begins with expectations being turned on their ears and a few sharp barbs, but soon, they realize how much they need each other. However, Daniel's past may get between them, with the potential to widow Emily before she's a wife.If you loved the Sound of Music or other books and or movies of that nature, then this book is just what you'll love. It's heartwarming and sweet, perfect for the Christmas season.Amanda Killgore"
5,A Jarring Romance Full of Mystery,"This is a well-written Regency Romance, full of twists and turns. The character development creates an amazing trail of life altering changes, in a sheltered young woman's life. Once you start reading about Emily Clarkson and Daniel Lennox, it will be difficult to put it down!"
2,Synthesizers and Water.,"'Journey into the world of NatureQuest.. an adventure in nature and music'. Moon Tides is rather slow, relaxing music with synthesizers, piano, pan flutes, harmonica, guitar, harps and lots of lapping water. The album is trying to reflect the 'many changes of the moon's daily journey and its impact on water'. Harps and Ocean??.. after listening to this, nice but not what I expected and am left unimpressed. Maybe it is mis-titled. It will go to my local Goodwill."
5,Beyond the Bildungsroman...growing up when your already grown,"I really enjoyed Fred Haefele's Rebuilding the Indian: A Memoir. This book is a delight. I liked it on several levels...there is real wrench-turning and parts hunting tales...there are colorful characters...there is a man undergoing a self-actualization and maturity coming to realize just what it means to be a man. He figures out where he fits in between his dad, his grown kids and his first and second wife and new baby all the while building a big motorcycle and running a arborist business. And it is fun while he is doing it.I gave it to my wife (a high school English teacher) and she gave it to some of her 11th grade reluctant readers who are more at home turning wrenches than they are writing essays. It appealed to these kids tremendously.I don't have a motorcycle and I am not going to build one but I do love reading about it. I found this to be a great book. If you like this one you may also like A Cliff Walk by Don Snyder."
5,"Okay, this book is Zen and the Art of mid-life crisies...",What a wonderful surprise this book was for me. I don't think there is a man over 30 that can't relate to this one. Not that it's just a guy book... Plenty of interest for anyone who has a life... I'm buying five more as gifts!
3,Juggling the Responsibilities,This is not a restoration book on how to rebuild Indian motorcycles but a story of a man who bought a 1941 Indian Chief and his joys and tribulations of trying to get the bike on the road while juggling the responsibilities of his real life.
4,a project finally finished,"Being a person who has started many a ""project"" I can truly appreciate the pride and satisfaction found in completion. This book demonstrates the value of lessons learned from the little things in life. So often I forget that life is a journey and not a destination. This book reminded me of that reality.The book's descriptions are honest and accurate regarding the frustrations of dealing with the relationships of both human and machine. It is somewhat simplistic in its language, but then again so is life in the ""real"" west.I enjoyed this book and I highly recommend this book for the man who is seeking his ""claim"" in life and (due to its short length) doesn't want to spend a lifetime finding it."
5,I want to do it too!,"I read this book after hearing about it on National Public Radio's ""All Things Considered."" The premise intrigued me, even though I've never ridden or driven a motorcycle (and probably never will.) But Fred (you too will refer to him by his first name after you've devoured his book) captures all the romance, heartbreak, and high drama of trying new things and restoring old things.He inspired me to do something similar. Will I rebuild an old motorcycle? Come on, get serious. But revitalizing a tube-era radio receiver just might be within the limits of my expertise and budget ...Thanks for the fun read, Fred. Only one quibble: why didn't the publisher spring for a color--rather than a B & W--photo of the Indian?"
2,"Didn't fulfill its promise, but I'm glad I read it.","One of the other reviewers perhaps said it best: I really wanted to like this book. As a mid-life motorcyclist (Harley) and pilot, with a penchant for old airplanes and motorcycles, I have long harbored the dream of restoring something really classic; a Harley J, a '32 Ford, a Stearman biplane, etc. So I grabbed the book without a second thought, anticipating a real restoration chronicle. What I got was part soap opera and part Pirsig, with a too-large serving of jobbing out a restoration to various subcontractors, and not enough nuts and bolts. Wish it had been edited bt Tom and Ray Magliozzi (The Tappet Brothers)."
4,Rewarding experience,"Let me preface this by saying I have been listening to EC since 1978...Despite the slightly dated sound on a few of the pieces, this is a wonderful CD with EC's usual exceptional lyrics and tunes. The real jewel, to me, is the bonus CD with the original demos for the songs without the lavish productions. I actually prefer to listen to this CD because it is so much easier to focus on EC's highly under-rated vocals. His musical and emotional range leaves most other modern artists in the dust. Definitely worth adding to your collection if you enjoy listening to a wonderfully talented songwriter and singer."
2,Average At Best,"This album is not much. The songs are extremely over-produced and generally uninteresting. With the exception of ""The World And His Wife"", there is nothing of note."
5,Stupendous performance!,"Spectacular, jaw-dropping & virtuosic are a few very inadequate words to describe the performances by violinist, Mela Tenenbaum of these Locatelli concertos. The technical skill is outstanding. I am in awe! i plan to get the subsequent volumes before they go out of print."
4,A fascinating glimpse into a troubled life,"I'm amazed at the review by Publishers's Weekly listed above. If this is a""gushing fan letter"" from Maher to Kerouac, I'd hate to see what Maher would writeabout someone he really didn't like!The greatest strength of this biography, for me, was the detail Maher providesabout Kerouac's daily life. So many biographies give you a series of highlightsand ""events"" but don't give you any sense of what the subject's life was like ona day-by-day basis. This biography actually answers the questions ""What didKerouac do when he got up in the morning? What did he do on an average day?"" Itin fact destroys any heroic, romantic image you might have of Kerouac and replacesit with a detailed image of who Kerouac really was---how he spoke; the way he approached writing;how he conducted his relationships; his intense, desperate, peripatetic wanderings. I found it tobe a very unusual and interesting glimpse into a very, very troubled life."
2,Dont believe the hype!,"I am from the East coast USA and never had Red Vines. I have been hearing for a long while how much better these are than the Twizzlers brand I was used to, & finally tried these and frankly I am not impressed. If you really want to try some good cherry flavor chews, try Cherry NIBS if you can find them. They are the best there is!"
2,little old!,I'm use to fresher from Amazon. These had best buy date 6 months away and were just enough stale that it was getting harder to chew.
3,trays,The licorice was not as fresh as I usually get in the big platic bins. Didn't like the flavor as much as the strawberry. Just wanted to try it.
5,Good Product -good price,"I need a wide range of gears on my electric bike since I have only one chainring, this 11-34 cassette filsl the bill.I can hardly wait until they produce an affordable 11 - 36."
5,Why we love health scares,"In Mass Listeria, Theodore Dalrymple, NHS doctor and contributor to the London Spectator, discusses the possible causes for our fascination with health scares. It goes far beyond just medicine (which Mr. Dalrymple gives little credit for our progress in longevity) and tries to explain why, despite the fact that the human race have never lived healthier and longer lives, we are in a constant state of panic about our health. An excellent and thought-provoking read."
5,After only two days of use.....,"I'm already enjoying using my tablet a LOT more... the Grip Pen is great, but, for me, the Classic is much more comfortable to work with because of its' smaller diameter.... plus, it's of typical Wacom quality...."
4,when all else fails,"I loved the Dove liquid hand soap. It was about the only hand soap that didn't ""eat my skin."" They stopped selling it in the small for home use bottles. I found really big bottles at Amazon.com. I filled all my little bottles with it. It is not exactly the same but it is working fine. My skin remains intact."
5,The best hand soap ever!,"We have used other hand soaps in our autodispenser with disastrous results (clogging).We will NOT use anything else. It's great on your hands, and doesn't clog our dispenser."
2,Too watery,"It was not properly sealed, it seemed like someone over the mail opened it a took some of it, be careful"
1,Insane Earrings,"They look great, but who wants to spin each earring through your earlobe every time you put them on? Wait a pain! Sent them back."
3,Very Pretty and Very Light,"As mentioned these are fairly small. I thought I would like to try them because they are different. I don't see many earrings you thread through your ear. As mentioned they are extremely light-weight and would be good for those wanting some length but no weight. They are very delicate, and bit too much so for me. I like bolder earrings because I'm very tall. I also have long hair and this could create a problem. I like them and will keep them. Good for hair pulled back or short. Very well packed."
5,Just what I wanted!,"I was looking for something simple, but a little different. The earspiral is perfect! I liked it so much I bought a somewhat different one in gold. Good quality."
1,not what expected at all,"They r very thin, look cheap! Don't waste your money! They looked very nice in the photos, however, when i recieved them, that was a big disappointment"
3,Plenty of love amidst a very scary story.,"Really enjoyed the two sisters' journey and watching them both learn how to deal with each other and live with each other in their lives. Nice development of the relationship between Mary and her partner. I would have liked to have seen more of him.Lots of great characters, including the moms. Twists and surprises in every chapter. Plenty of love amidst a very scary story.Couldn't put it down! Lots of vivid imagery (and some ""wish it could be unseen"" imagery).Loved it!"
2,Sleep Tight by Anne Frasier,Can somebody please explain why authors need to fill page after page with non essential words and then in the last three chapters show their writing potential? I had read Hush and was so excited about this book just to be hughly dissappointed.The story line is great but the drival in between just to fill pages is very irritating. I have download more of Anne Frasiers books but now wonder if they r worth the effort?
1,Soooo Disappointing,"Minneapolis police have a serial killer on their hands, one who is targeting blonde women, removing their eyes, and grafting flowers onto their fingers. Police immediately suspect a recently released convict of the crimes, but once the man is jailed and the murders continue to happen, police must scramble to find the real killer before more women die.This is the last Anne Frasier book I will be reading. The plot was just dull. There was no excitement or thrill to this supposed thriller. There was a sibling rivalry aspect to this novel, between police officers, that was just silly. And the murdered friend angle was a giant yawn. Overall, I find Anne Frasier's novels to disappointing. I would not recommend them to anyone."
3,"Interesting, quick read","This book by Anne Frasier was an enjoyable read. She is able to take a mystery and keep your interest throughout the novel. The characters are believable and interesting and the plot keeps you turning the pages. It is an enjoyable read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Will read more from author.,This was my first Anne Frasier book. I enjoyed it and plan to read others by this author. It was a fast and easy read.
5,A few editing problems,"Poor editing always interfers with the enjoyment of any book. It's obvious that this was not properly edited; if I could, I'd take off half a star for that. Otherwise, this was a great story."
5,Like watching an episode of Criminal Minds,"a great book that I couldn't put down. I started it around 10 PM and finished it at 5 AM the following morning. It's a suspenseful thriller that is much like watching an episode of Criminal Minds. These FBI agents analyze the behavior of serial killers in order to determine who they are. And the entire time you are left guessing who the killer is, until the very end. Well worth the read. Can't wait to read more by this author!"
4,More Like Sleep With One Eye Open,"This was a great mystery. You will certainly have a difficult time finding out ""whodunit"". There are a number of twists and turns which makes the book interesting and holds your attention. Also, this book delves into family feelings which is good as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I recommend Anne Frasier to anyone that likes a mystery. I read another one of her books on a plane returning from Germany, and I could not put it down. She has my attention for future kindle books. Buy and enjoy!"
4,Good Read,I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters were well developed and likable. I liked the ending. You end up understanding how each character became who they were and yet there was healing in the end. The mystery was interesting.
2,Felt like a waste **SPOILERS**,"I love a good mystery & thriller, but this felt like such a waste...The story felt scattered, & felt like so many stories thrown into one book.SPOILERS!!! DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW!!!!!!The one thing I didnt appreciate, you read the book, only to have the 'bad guy' someone that was never mentioned in the book. And then you get a quick back story to his crazed mind. It just felt thrown in, like a different book... & then a waste of time.Then the main idea of the young girl that was murdered -we dont find out the truth until the last few pages. Really?I usually like every book, but honestly, was like ""Really?"" at this one & was so glad it was over."
5,Great read!,"This was the second book I've read by this author (the first beingHush) and both were fantastic reads for the genre. This book has a great set of characters which develop throughout the read. The plot was well thought out, and wasn't obvious so there are surprises in store for the reader at the end. The book is written in the third person and alternates between characters (including the killer). In both books I've read, the author does an awesome job of coming up with sick and twisted killers and really letting you get inside their head, which is both interesting and maybe a bit disturbing, but I enjoy it nonetheless...I loaned this book from the kindle owners lending library, and while I did find a few typos the digital edition was fairly well edited. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the crime thriller genre and is a fan of authors like James Patterson etc. I will definitely be reading more of this author!"
3,"OK story, some major typos, ending came out of nowhere","This was an ok story, it kept my interest to the end but the ending did not seem to fit the story line and came out of nowhere. For an author who was quoted as""an award-winning, USA Today bestselling author"", there were a few major typos that would seem they should have been caught by a good copy editor: (1) ""Clothes Uttered"" instead of Clothes littered..."" (2) ""sink to the bottom of die deep end"" instead of ""the deep end"" - and next sentence begins ""She would he there"" instead of ""be there"". It just seems that these are major typos that should have been caught by any proofreader."
2,Made me Want to Beat My Head Against the Wall,"I am using this book in an Intro to Judaism class, so have a certain amount of required reading in it each week, as well as in several other books on the topic of Judaism. Every time I have to pick this one up, I groan. This has to be the worst written book ever. You can read three pages to find out what he could have said in three sentences. The author REALLY likes to hear himself talk. Boring, boring, boring, boring. The only reason I didn't give it no stars is because if you can FORCE yourself to keep going, you do eventually get some useful info, but only after the author beats the point to death, revives it, and beats it some more...."
3,A good introduction to Judaism,"I think this is a fine, straight-forward book about Judaism. If you are already familiar with the faith, it may not speak much to you, and you will want to find something more advanced. But for those seeking a simple clarification or review of the Jewish faith, this book should prove to be just what it claims: a basic summary. I give it ""three and a half stars"", because it is an above-adequate, but not quite exceptional book. To be exceptional, or further in depth, it would have to be much longer. But for its length - about 172 pages of relatively straight-forward reading, it does just fine."
4,Great Information,I found this book helpful and useful for myself and to help explain some customs to others. Mine is a paperback book and small enough to travel with. Good read!
1,not very good...,i could only read half an hour of this. ive read over a dozen guides in this vien. dont waste your money.
4,For History Lovers,"For those of us who enjoy reading about the days before we were even thought of, this is a great book about out beginnings in England. It is difficult for us to understand the hardships our forbears endured. It is not only well written but Jack Cavanaugh brings us along very well in this series of events."
2,A bible quoting melodrama,"with a ""Blam, blam, thwack, thwack"" silly ending. But the final joke is on me! I bought 3 of the follow-up books (along with this one) that I will never read. I have nothing against ""Christian"" books, but this one was too heavy for me."
1,I did not enjoy this book at all,"I did not like this book at all! It gave me a weird feeling as I read it. Sure there are certain aspects of the book that are not all that bad, such as, the historical significance intertwined within the story. But, for the most part, the story weirded me out. There were certain events that Cavanaugh described in such detail that it made me sick to my stomach. I couldn't get some of the things he described out of my head. And still, I remember certain things that are just not worth the reading experience of this book. If you do want to read one of Cavanaugh's books, I suggest ""The Allies"" or ""The Victors."" They, in my opinion, were good historical books."
3,The title might be a bit much,"The name extreme mountain biking might lead you to believe that this video is full of crazy stunts done on bicycles. Well to the average person that may be what it looks like but to a serious cyclists the stuff is kinda outdated now.With videos like Kranked 3, North Shore Extreme 3, Double Down, and New World Disorder there are other truly extreme videos to pick from that outdo this one.All in all it's not a bad video but it's just not as good as some others."
4,Excellent guide to implementation,"While I have read a lot of books on this topic, this one goes above and beyond all. The emphasis on the practical aspects of how to implement a data warehouse was extremely useful, since all the steps are clearly laid out.More than being a theoretical text, this book acts a practical guide to datawarehouse design and implementation.The language is also easy to follow and the recommended readings/bibliography points to some excellent resources."
5,A top class encyclopedia!,"An excellent compendium of Data Warehousing, Modeling, and Management processes. It is a detailed practical-guide for IT implementers and a terrific framework for Architectes to optimize productivity. Reality based discussion of trade-offs in fast changing market, enterprise, and customer will come in handy in everyday decisions.Even though I live in the DW-BI World, I found kernels of truth often compromized in favor of saving time, and appreciated a refreshing view of pros and cons for doing it right, whether from start or while upgrading / integrating.You will find yourself going back to many sections to share with your staff. A great read and terrific reference for your DW-BI reading. It sits on my reference shelf with many dogeared pages and underlined sections."
1,"Base Premise: ""Your House Burns Down and Your Family Loses Everything""","Base Premise: ""Your House Burns Down and Your Family Loses Everything"". You can't make this stuff up! Love to find a video game to help my daughter with Math, but one based on, literally, HER WORST NIGHTMARE might not quite make the grade. Perhaps one based on going to a combined funeral for her grandparents and pets might be even better. Guess the designers don't have kids. Oy!"
1,Don't be fooled by the positive reviews,"I agree totally with the negative reviews posted. Where IS the math?? Having to install the DVD each time you play the game is at least inconvenient, if not aggravating. And most of the time the student has to follow around that stupid mouse, clicking on everything in site, trying to find the next LITTLE bit of math games. My daughter likes answering the questions and doing the math, but the clickin' adventure is a frustrating nuisance."
1,Waste of Time and money,"...BR>I do NOT recommend this software for anyone considering building a personal or e-commerce web site. The package comes with 2 manuals but there are NO recommendations as to which one you should start with. If building an e-commerce site, you are forced to pay an additional $... for a ""credit card license"". PayPal, I believe is free. You are forcing me to ""shell out"" additional cash just to test my application. No tutorial comes with the software, you must pay extra for that. You are restricted to ASP. You need an additional tool, which you must purchase for JSP. There is nothing intutive about the software and it is difficult to use. I do not understand how they sold so many copies as they claim."
2,You better know web development!,"I recently purchased this software after looking for a total web ecommerce solution. The software installs easily but the system could not find my browser to register. Not a great sign since this is the first program I have ever encountered that could not connect with my DSL server and register.I spent about 6 hours reading the documentation. Let me start by telling you that I have been programming for 20 years. Everything from Cobol to html. I find this program a bit complicated.If you are an experienced web developer than this is probably a good option. I am looking for point and shoot. I want to spend my time updating content and the shopping cart database, not learning and adjusting every factor the customer sees.Don't expect much from the included templates. It only comes with a few very simple templates. I have seen better layouts in shareware!"
1,Don't expect much,"This program was really a disappointment. As mentioned previous, the templates are real weak and limited and really offer no value. The e-commerce capabilities are not intuitive and overall I found it to be a waste of my money. Shareware offers better products."
5,"Yeah, it's that good","The last time I listened to this album (yes, album) as often as I have the last few weeks I was wearing pointy shoes, camo pants and a shitload of XTC buttons on my moldy leather jacket. It's a pleasure to dip back into the archive and find something that still has this much vitality.This is the finest hour of one of EC's many 'eras'. Here, with the Atractions in 'full tilt, the best-damn-band-ever' mode he creates pop bliss on a razor's edge. If you want to find all of the missing links of rock's evolution, snap this one up and prepare to find something that really mattered."
5,"OH, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN....","Elvis was at the top of his game from day one.After this album,his third, he created a flawless trilogy. Costello's songsare full of emotion - anger, bitterness, jealousy, but alsodeep thought and honesty, even beauty.Every track is a classic. The bonus disc is also full of gems, some great demos,and a brilliant live set. BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!!"
3,OK,This was an attempt to expand my musical horizons and I largely bought it based on the spectacular reviews. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could because it is above average but not 4 stars. Just not something I'll play all that much though it does have 3 or 4 tracks that I'll burn into a keeper CD. Just too remote and formulated for my taste.
5,"fun, clever and tuneful.","when i first bought armed forces i kept playing ""Olivers army"" over and over again! because it is a great catchy song and it was the only one i had heard of! After a couple of days i was hooked on the whole album, from the quirky ""sundays best"" to the infectious ""2 little hitlers"".truly attictive."
5,Brilliant Songwriting,"This disk represented a radical change for Elvis Costello, as he and the Attractions moved from the bare raw sound of ""This Year's Model"" toward more layers and orchestration. Elvis states that they were listening to ABBA on the bus, but do not hold that against them. The cascading piano and layered keys on ""Accident's Will Happen"" and ""Oliver's Army"" still spit with bile of the angry young man. Sparse arrangements, like ""Moods for Moderns"", ""Senior Servitude"", and ""Green Shirt"" are mixed in, giving the disk a complex series of shifting moods. Nick Lowe's influence, as demonstrated by ""Two Little Hitlers"" (Nick had recorded a tune called ""Little Hitler"" about the same time) as well as Elvis' definitive cover of Nick Lowe's ""What So Funny (About Peace, Love and Understanding)"" shine throughout the release. Listen to the complicated word play and lyrical mastery throughout the disk. A must have!"
5,Pessimism and sarcasm at it's best,"Favorite songs: Chemistry Class, Green Shirt, Two Little Hitlers, Big Boys, Alison, Oliver's Army, What's So Funny Bout Peace Love and Understanding?"
3,box too large,"I received my order of two cd's in a very large box, what resulted in a extra custom's tax of 10 euro (= 16 dollar!). So would you please want to sent the cd's for buyers in Europe in a smaller box or envellope!?"
5,The Rose of Tibet,"I first read this novel in August 1974. It was recommended to me by someone in Izmir after, what I now realise, was something of a Lionel Davidson scemario. I had wondered about the camouflage planes on standby at Istanbul and Izmir airports. I had been in Italy, taken up an invitation by a virtual stranger and found myself in Turkey just as it started war in Cyprus. As there was no means of getting out of the country - and I had been rung by the British Consulate to tell me of this - I sat on the roof and read the Rose of Tibet. I couldn't put it down. I have read it 3 times since and am never sure whether Houston existed or not. I have recommended it to my reading group and we are about to discuss it tomorrow.I shall be interested to hear what they think but for me this is one of my desert island top 10 choices."
3,A Good Way to Pass Some Time,"I read this book in 1982 and thought it was a pretty darn good read. I've since re-read it a few weeks ago, and while it hasn't stood the test of time very well, it's still not a horrible way to spend a few hours. Bonus points for the female lead referring to Charles Houston as Chao-li, though!"
3,Self-indulgent but interesting,"This is a brutally honest autobiographical look at a life wasted in dreaming the impossible dream. Unlike Don Quixote, there is no effort to bring the dream into reality. There is a lot of self-indulgent drinking and judgement of other people and very little insight into self. Apparently, at some point in time Exley overcame his lethargy and wrote this memoir. Unfortunately, he does not share his experience of becoming a functional adult that must have led up to the writing of this book. This is a well-written book, but it seems to be incomplete without that episode. He teases us with it, but never delivers.I have to disagree with the blurbs on the back cover of this book, which use the words ""hilarious"" and ""funny"". This book is enither. There are some bittersweet moments that approach a wry sort of humor, but never hilarity or funniness. The NY Times review says ""singularly moving"". I agree heartily with that."
2,Did not care for this book.,"This book had good reviews. The vocabulary was outstanding. I did not like the story. I am still confused about whether the book was fiction, part-fiction or autobiographical. I found the book pathetic and Mr. Exley a depressing person."
2,Somebody please email me what happens at the end...,"I had high expectations for this novel at it was recommended by many talented authors. However, I couldn't wrap my mind around it. It is beautifully written with amazing prose - Exley is indeed brilliant. Unfortunately it moved too slow and because I am not a football fan, found myself bored in many aspects. I can only make it to page 250 and then I gave up. I hate to do it; however, I'm just not excited to exert the effert it would take the finish the novel when I have so many others to read. I hate not knowing the endings of novels...however odd that sounds. Could somebody please email me at: love_portland@yahoo.com and let me know what happens at the end? I would really appreciate it. And any other book suggestions are, as always, welcome. Thank you!"
4,Want to Write a Big Famous Book?,"If you've ever dreamed of being an unemployed, mentally unstable, smart-mouthed drunk, living off the kindness of others and writing a heart wrenching novel about visions of grandeur, countless failures and a strange obsession with a N.Y Giants running back, forget about it.Frederick Exley already has.When you finish this book you will, at the same time, feel sorry for him and strangely wish that you could live his life and tell his stories.At the very least you will want to sit down and buy him a beer or two or three...-steven cloud"
5,"A Brilliant, Tragic Novel Base On Life","This is an autobiographical novel that is even more autobiographical than many people realize. Frederick Exley was truly a ""one book author,"" who could only write variations on the same theme in later years. This is a brilliant, tragic book, exquisitely written and sharply observed."
3,Realistic if overly pessimistic,"I considered giving this book the entire five stars, but I feel that too many reviews are either 1 or five, without enough criticsm and analysis of the actual text. I assume that is because people only go back and review their favorite books and possibly a few that they hated. This book is fiercely intelligent and insightful. Exley's study of a man trapped by his own unrealistic expectations will remind many people of their own thoughts, or at least of someone they know. It is also very depressing, because the protaganist's problems are almost entirely self created, and although we pity him, we also would have a hard time excepting such behavior from a real aquaitence. In the end, his victory is in telling the story, which may be an end worthy of the means if it is treated as a cautionary tale by like-minded individuals instead of a glorifications of the intellectual recluse and a condemnation of making real efforts to see positive things in life."
5,One of a kind,"There are a number of truly excellent reviews of this book on Amazon praising it highly . I agree with the praise. I remember reading the book , and wondering how the writer and main character who had failed in everything had realized my dream of writing a great book which would somehow justify the life and cancel the failure.I do not remember the book that well. I do remember that in reading I felt it was the remarkably honest account of a person whose experience and language were rich and wild in a way mine were not.The sympathy for the character were however qualified by a sense that even one's own self- destructiveness should have a limit - and that when it comes to screwing up things for the people closest to you - the ones who do possibly care a little."
5,One of the most moving and literate memoirs of this century.,"A Fan's Notes is an original work that will transport you through the full spectrum of emotions. While Exley's life is certainly seen by himself to be a failure, the fact that it resulted in one of the finest books of modern times makes it a success. This personal piece will move you to laughter, tears, and an introspection of your own trials and tribulations"
5,One of the great books,"This is one of the great books in American Literature. Every now and then, but not often, you come across a book that has no reference and no peer in your experience. I think of Henry Miller and I think of Holden Caulfield. Death of A Salesman. And The Scarlet Letter. Anyone who has dealt with mental illness in their family, and trying to make it in America, being an outsider and fitting in, well, nothing much has changed . . ."
5,"Funny, insightful and beautifully moving...","An amazing work of (non)fiction. Can it all be true. I hope not for Exley's sake. Currently, the best book I have ever read."
3,Dissolute does not equal genius,"Exley's torments are so well-rendered that readers for the past 30 years have tripped over themselves to praise this novel as a high achievement of Art. But Art, or genius, requires more than a scabrously told tale of one's own dissolution; in fact, the writing is often disjointed and nearly always overwrought, no more precise than a really good term paper by a writer with a thesaurus fetish. Exley's celebration of his own patheticism is, for this reader at least, no cause for celebration."
1,The CD-ROM contains a virus,"I was disappointed to learn that a publisher like Prentice Hall would ship a book without scanning the CD-ROM for viruses. The book content looks very good but it is not worth buying a book, installing the CD-ROM only later to find it trashed your computer. Thank goodness my scanning software caught it in time. Granted, Prentice Hall will exchange the CD-ROM for a new one, but they should have mentioned that in their statements here at Amazon."
3,NRBQ - Honest Dollar,"This compilation of live material from the Big Al era yields some exceptional moments however most of the wacky, offbeat, dissonant stuff can only really be appreciated in person (if you could go back in time)."
3,"Good , but could have been better!!!","This ten year song and video of Celine Dion fell short to my expectations. I realize that there were so many outstanding performances and videos that she made over the past ten years, it would be impossible to put all of them on one dvd. But I did expect to see her best. I did not. There were some music videos on this collection that I never saw before. I am not saying they were not good but far from her best. For instance, her duo with Andrea Boccelli or for that matter Barbra Streisand was not on it. One of her great duet performances was with Pebo Bryson called ""Beauty and the Beast"", it was on the dvd but Pebo did not sing it with her.If you are a great fan of Celine, like I am, buy this dvd, but don't expect the world."
1,A Disappointed Fan Writes...,"I anxiously awaited this release, but found it disappointing. Her voice is outstanding. There's just no disputing her talent as a musical performer. Unfortunately, her music videos are, well, very very lame.This DVD really lacks the emotion of her 1995 Colour of My Love Concert DVD.If you're only going to buy one Celine Dion DVD, make it the live concert -- not this collection."
3,Should contain better videos,There are some videos missing like Think Twice and Only One Road. These videos should have been included. I agree Because You Loved Me should have been original video.
5,Celine- A decade off song and video,"An absolute must for any celine fan. this material covers her from the time she started singing in english, and broke into america, and is truly a must have dvd. I have watched mine a thousand times and still love it."
1,Same Old....,"I expected to see the videos that has not been on VH1 for thousands of times. Besides the new ones, and ""Misled"" which is great, the others are pretty known and it gets boring to watch and listen over and over for the same old songs. What happened to great videos and not as much viewed like, ""Last plane out"" "" Immortality"", 'Only one road"" ""all by Myself"" etc...? Hope next one is more original"
3,celine dion- al the way... a decade of songs & video,"this dvd was a disappointment to me. because to much live proformers. i yet live proformers. but she is one hell of a singer,also she is one of my best female singerjd"
1,Was this review helpful to you?,Celine Dion is the bomb. How like the bomb in this. DVF is the bomb. Celine hee!Was this review helpful to you?Well?
5,"""The Woman"" ..........","DVD was ""Fantastic"" ......... Only what a person would expect from a Woman of Song like Celine ........"
1,Don Rose needs to look for better than Delta and DeWalt,"I finally gave up on Delta power tools due to poor quality and reliability. Even if made in the USA (the only possible benefit), there are many brands and options that are far better and still reasonably priced. Delta tools are discount store junk that lack basic features and operational usefulness. They lack accuracy, reliability, and are poorly built. Don Rose should be ashamed to recommend them even if he is getting paid big bucks to do so."
3,Not as Pleasing as I hoped,While I was reading this book I was thinking about other things..I dont like it when books bore me and thats why I gave it few stars. I found myself trailing off and finding it hard to get to the next page..... Although the Hardy Boys and Nancy make quite a team..i still expected better..
3,"Wonderful program, yet moderate perfromance....","This performance of the Dresden Statskappelle from the Semper Opera, Dresden is surprisingly disappointing. Sinopoli seems to have difficulty communicating his vision to the orchestra, and as a result the orchestra sounds reserved and insecure. Of the Alpine Symphony performance, many of the great moments are troubled by insecure brass playing, a problem also evident in the Wagner. This frequent instability causes the brasses to sound individualistic rather than cohesive as a section, and cohesiveness is the key to this work. The strings are generally excellent throughout and the sound quality of the disc is ok, yet not up to par with other Arthaus DVD's."
4,Solid Line-Up,"This album features some great New York players in solo and ensemble works. A good, somewhat embellished Telemann arrangement starts off the recording. The Biber sonata for six trumpets is also admirable, if you like the New York sound. The Telemann sonata played by Stephen Burns is my favorite piece on the album. His crisp articulation and singing notes make an otherwise dull piece subtle and stirring. Other pieces that you don't often see on baroque albums include the Zelenka reiterfanfares and Altenberg's concerto for seven trumpets and timpani, both played cleanly. The only thing one could hold against these guys is that their sound isn't as full as it could be."
5,Expanding Creativity,"The photographs of her stunning quilts initially encouraged me to purchase Vikki Pignatelli's ""Quilting Curves."" But I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a wealth of information between the covers of this book.The author begins with an explanation of her method of quilting, incorporating curves and sharp points into her designs. I liked the contemporary patterns, beginning with simple quilts using a minimum of templates, and advancing to more complex designs, and also her discussion of improvisional quilts. Vikki shares her methods and patterns and insights and encourages quilters to develop their own designs and expand their creativity. Her method is unusual, but I was impressed with how easily mistakes can be corrected with a minimum of effort. The end results are impressiveI think this book is easy to understand and uplifting in spirit. I'm very happy with how my own quilt design, honoring Valentine's Day turned out. I recommend ""Quilting Curves."
5,works just fine,13 [..] for 50' of s-video cable...free (very fast)shipping..it works just as it should...whats not to like?
3,Works but needs to be shielded,The cable works but I found that the cable should be shielded because you can see lines going up and down the television.
5,Sugar is is more tart than sweet,"""Copper Blue"" is the best album that Sugar guitarist Bob Mould has been involved with since the great Husker Du broke up. This album is Mould coming to grips with both his punk past and his pop songwriter's sensibility. The result is a lot of great guitar squalls wrapping themselves around radio ready fare like ""If I Can't Change Your Mind"" and ""Helpless."" Mould's gutteral growl and stinging guitar work highlight the album, but this is also his strongest set of songs as a songwriter. Overall, a classic and one of the best rock albums of the early 1990s."
5,The Best Album Of All Time,"You can listen to bands in the genre of Nirvana or REM and think great, but one listen to copper blue and you are simply blown away. From the first chords of The Act We Act, to the perfect cadence of Man On The Moon, this album never lets up. Although the basics are pure power, it's the subtle guitar melodies in the background and the vocals that carry the tracks along, not a new thing for fans of Husker Du, Moulds unbelievable previous band. Stand out tracks are hard to pick out due to the strength of the album, if anything, Hoover Dam and If I Cant Change Your Mind, only for the fact that they are acoustic based. Anyone who knows anything about Rock/Pop should own this album. He aint called the godfather of alternative for nothing, a real masterpiece by Bob Mould"
5,"Speechless, still","Every once in a while, an album comes along that is simply too good for words. This is the crowning achievement of the man who, arguably more than any other, inspired grunge, for better or for worse. (I lean strongly toward the latter, and the blistering ""I Hate Alternative Rock"" from Mould's eponymous release three albums after this one makes me think he might agree.)Never mind ""Nevermind."" If it's not heresy to suggest, something got lost in translation somewhere between Husker Du and Nirvana. _Copper Blue_ is how it should have been done all along."
4,still good after all these years...,"The other day, I was looking at my CD collection. I saw ""Copper Blue"" and decided to play that since it hadn't been played in such a long time. And you know what? The music still sounds as invigorating, aggressive, and relevant as ever! Bob Mould is one talented songwriter! Melodic, power-pop, alternative never sounded this good. It's a shame that this CD didn't get alot more attention like it should have. Now I'm seriously thinking of buying some of Bob's solo stuff."
5,The best rock album of the decade.,"Certain albums stand head and shoulders above everything around them. When this came out, it set the standard early for 90s rock. Like all timeless albums, it holds up start to finish, the whole being greater than the individual songs (it reminds me of a 90s ""Let It Bleed"", if you dig). I've been waiting for someone to do something better... I don't see it happening. If you want something richer, more breathtaking, more vibrant, relevant, multi-hued... I don't know what to tell you. Copper Blue is the summit."
4,Thank You Bob Mould,"Thanks, Bob...thanks for your well written tunes and hum-able melodies in this context...Thanks for writing Hoover Dam! Wish you were given more recognition for your songs."
4,Took a while,"It took me 12 years to really appreciate this album. I got it before I knew who Husker Du even were and it put me to sleep every time I listened to it. Never could understand why. So after I heard Husker Du and knew they were an awesome band, I played this one. Right to sleep. Recently, I played it again. I don't know what changed but I love it more with every listen. NBeautiful stuff - some really tight songwriting, beatiful instrumentation. Weird."
1,What the?,"I came to visit this page because some reviewer was wrecking Train's new album to bits, and they said if you want to hear a truly good album, try this. What the hell is so good about this? I dont get it. The guys voice stinks, the music is so loud, he sounds muffled in the background. Someone compared this to REM? Give me a break, REM blows this away. I never heard of this group Sugar before, and I know this junk dont sell. I guess there is some cult following of people who think this guy Bob Mould is good. Well, your all disallusioned and your dead wrong. HE SUCKS!! This crap gives alternative a really bad name!"
4,Strong all the way through...,"Stylistically, Sugar has some of the wall-of-sound shoegazer thing going for it, the intensity of Rob Mould's vocals and lyrics, some subtly subversive harmonic shifts, topped off with a power pop gloss. Like many people, I was only aware of the top-40 hit ""If I Can't Change Your Mind,"" a fairly bland pop song with a trendy-for-the-time grunge overlay. I borrowed the cd from my local library on a whim, and to my surprise, the rest of the songs on the cd are far better. Recommended."
1,Waiting for a Payoff,"I was intrigued by the concept of this book: a present-day world assuming the Confederacy had prevailed in the Civil War.The problem is that the book never pays off on the setup. I had to force myself to keep reading with the hope that an interesting story or compelling characters were just around the corner. After 100 pages, I gave up.I'd recommend Gore Vidal's Lincoln as an enjoyable read in historical fiction."
1,"I judged this one by its cover,,and lost!!","Ater reading the dust cover on this book ,I snapped it up.the first chapter was ok with a little info on how the south won the war of northern aggression,,,then it was all down hill after that.To much detail put into areas that had nothing to do about nothing.A liberal mis-mash about the joys of race mixing,homosexuality,and such,with nothing what so ever to do with alternative history...very hard to get through."
3,Not bad!,"This book avoids the preachiness that usually accompanies any book about the Civil War, it's origins, and it's aftermath.Never mind that a victorious Confederacy would not have remained viable into the 20th century, Means is able to tell a good story in this very unusual setting."
4,"Intriguing Alternative Future, Promising Fiction Debut","Here is a provocative first novel about future that might have been. The South won the war. The North was a desolate industrial wasteland relying on cheap immigrant labor. But it is also a world of equity. The immigrants, while exploited, can earn full citizenship. Black America, while rigidly separated from White America, is fully equal. The United States was isolationist not interventionist. Against this backdrop, Howard Means spins an interesting tale of young but forbidden love, of rebellion and radical change. I found this fresh, different and readable, and a welcome change from overworked plots with serial killers pursued by not-very-interesting private investigators."
1,Wonderful for Rebel apologists,"This book asks the reader to believe that in 1871 the victorious Southern Congress would not only give slaves their freedom and the vote, but control of the House of Representatives and half the country. This is only believable for Confederate apologists who want people to believe that slavery would have eventually ""disappeared"" somehow. Southerners in the mid-19th century believed blacks were subhuman. This book asks you to believe that they would ignore their beliefs and treat blacks ""equally"" just because they had a change of heart. This is more than nitpicking, as some reviewerers have suggested. Books like this have to have some small level of believability, otherwise why not change everything? Lets write a book where Robert E. Lee lives forever and everybody turns orange. It would be as believable as this book"
2,Imperial heresy? (2.5 stars),"Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic, but 'Bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings. 'Beyond Belief' and 'Man Out of Time' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of' compilation. 'Long Honeymoon', 'Human Hands' and 'Every Home' are somewhat interesting. However, beyond that I find little that's especially compelling here.There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom' recordings, thanks in part to Steve Nieve's scorching work on the ivories. In fact, the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still' and the toe-tap inducing ""From Head to Toe"" merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites."
4,"Some great tunes, too much production","Listen to the opening lines of ""The Loved Ones"" and you hear Costello at his best. Snappy lines, sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit. Then we hit the piano ""noodling"" and the song starts to drift away from me. The CD is filled with moments like this; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments. Stripped down, this is some of Costello's best stuff; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect. But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song, I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose. This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine, but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM."
5,Elvis lives in his definitive work!,"I've always thought ""Imperial Bedroom"" to be Elvis' masterpiece and only recently listened to it again through headphones a la REM's ""Up"". I'd never listened to it before this way and the sound and subtle nuances are even better enjoyed this way. Elvis' songwriting on ""Imperial Bedroom"" was at it's most crisp, witty and insightful. Every track on here is a true jem...a shining jewel. Well worth the money if you spring for the gold masterdisc. Some of these songs made me cry then and still resonate now. I'm glad I saw him on the ""Imperial Bedroom"" and glad I have this CD!"
2,Teaches nothing,"I bought this DVD thinking it would help me learn to sculpt, but all I learned is that the author can sculpt, and he shows off his talent. He's amazing, don't get me wrong, but if you're looking to learn how to sculpt, there's not much this DVD has to offer in my opinion."
4,Great Pictures but problem with Battery Door and Lens,"It takes great pictures! I had to send back my unit twice because the tiny plastic clip in the battery door keeps breaking off for some reason. Also be extra careful handling the unit. The lens retraction mechanism is very delicate. Next time, I will go for a camera with a lens that stays inside the body. Also remember, the repair warranty only lasts 6 months."
5,Excellent camera,"I am new to he digital camera and this is the first one I got. I still need to learn the different focus mode that works in different condition but, I took quite a few pictures as soon as I bought it with auto setting and guess what, the picture was beautifull. I fell in love with this camera already. One down side is the LCD view monitor was not as flexible as Canon G-3 camera."
2,Camera Loses its Settings Every Battery Change,"This camera takes excellent photos and in particular I like its ability to take photos in low light conditions. However, I can not recommend it based on my experience. After less than two years the capacitor that maintains the date, time, and user-mode settings failed. Now everytime I change the batteries, no matter how quickly I change them, the camera loses these settings. It's very annoying and in my opinion a serious product defect. Based on my Internet research I am not alone in having this problem and Olympus apparently has no interest in offering a reasonably priced repair. Very disappointing."
4,Sudden unexpected problems,"I have been using my Camedia C-5050 for 13 months. I was always VERY pleased with good picture quality. One of the big pluses this camera has is the lens. While on a trip in Brazil I was able to take pictures of wildlife at dawn when a friend of mine with a similar 5MP cmaera of another brand could not get his to focus because of lack of light.Unfortunatelly, just after 1 year of use I had to send it in for repairs since all the pictures started turning out purple! All resetting and formatting of storage cards was to no avail. Sending a great camera for repairs when you've always treated it with great care, is discouraging, but I guess that can happen with any camera or brand.Rodolfo"
2,Very Dissapointed,"I owned an Olympus C-3040 and had a great experiences with the camera. After reading reviews I upgraded to the C-5050 (worst mistake ever). The pictures were out of focus most of the time and with noticible noise. I adjusted everything from AF spot to Sharpness, but seemed to get the same results. Comparing my old pictures from C-3040 to C-5050 I am very dissapointed. I returned it back to the store and waiting to either go with the Sony DSC-F717 or upgrade to the New Canon Rebel digital which is due mid-sept. I wish I never sold my original C-3040. But I will try out all cameras before buying to see how the crisp the photos come out when I upload them to my laptop."
3,Weak lens ruins a good camera for third time,"This is the third time the lens mechanism has broken. The first one was with a similar C-3030 and it was repaired under warranty. The second time it broke it was not under warranty and too expensive to repair. I thought the lens looked sturdier on the C-5050, but it failed.The mechanism that moves the lens in and out failed. It had taken two pictures and then the next picture the lens just got stuck.I've pulled the camera apart - but can't get the lens out - maybe I'll try again.Its too bad because the lens was good for the camera's compact size, for its age it was fun to use all the controls and it was very good in low light.My other camera I had to sell on eBay for parts - I fear this will go the same way."
5,"Good quality, easy to use",I've had this camera for about three months now. I don't mind that it's heavier than most. I love the feel of it -- no trouble holding it in one hand. Picture quality is very good.
1,massive auto-focus problems,"I've owned several olympus digital cameras. The 2020, 3030, and D40 (and now the 5050). I returned the 5050 6 hours after purchasing. The camera takes wonderful pictures, has a feature set to die for, and all around is a fantastic product...except. about 40-70% of the time it takes pictures completely out of focus. If you're careful and setup the shot very carefully the pictures are fantastic. If there is a fore-ground and a background the camera tends to focus on the background blurring the foreground. After 4 years of digital photography this is the only camera that has ever behaved this way. Great camera and pictures for carefully composed pictures, as a point/shoot this camera fails most of the time. Not suitable for my wife to use for quick pictures of the kids...{sigh} I really liked the feature set."
3,great little canera but look out...,I like the pictures this camera takes but when I bought it I was told I could get an extended zoom to go with it to reach x 10 and now I learn that the zoom is very limited and doesn't even reach x10. Accesories are hard to find and way to camera spacific. Look on this site and see how many adapters are listed touse with the 5050 zoom....If I had to do it all over again I would buy something else
3,Simple and Effective,"""Cathedral"" is a simple game to learn and one that will be quickly picked up by anyone who tries it.The idea is to take over as much territory within a medieval town's walls as possible. You do this by placing your various buildings in strategic places within the playing area.The game itself is made from wood, and the pieces are quite a good size. As such, they are durable and will last ages before any wear and tear begins to show.I personally found myself quickly becoming bored with the game, as it does not seem to have the endless variety that a game such as chess can provide. The relative movements and strategies you can develop are fairly limited, in that sense.However, ""Cathedral"" is different and it is simple. If there are only two players, it makes a quick, fast game to fill a few minutes with. However, should your inclincations be toward longer, more in-depth games, this is not the best of them."
5,"Challeging, simple, and fun","Although I can't comment directly on the durability of this specific set since I have a different version (Polystone Edition), I can say that Cathedral is a great game. It reminds me of other classics in challenge - like Chess & Go - but the games are much shorter, averaging about 5-10 minutes each. The rules are simple enough for everyone to catch onto easily, and there are even simple tournament rules for when you have more than 2 players around."
5,I have been searching and searching for this game!,"And I'm glad to find it in time for my husband's birthday. I played it when I was younger, and now that I'm married I've been looking for games that are perfect for two people (many games are not). I'm even willing to risk the pieces coming apart in the July humidity (that's how much I like this game)."
5,Mom,"A great quality game that requires strategic thinking. I play it with my 4 year old (we don't claim spaces, we just play to see who can fit in the most pieces) and I play it correctly with my 6 year old. It's suitable, challenging and enjoyable for all ages.[[ASIN:B00000IZXG Family Games cathedral classic]"
5,Great Family game that is quick!,"We received this game a few years ago as a gift for my boys (now teenagers). It is a quick game to learn and to play allowing several ""matches"" in a half-hour. This game gets pulled out of the cupboard routinely through the year....so much so that I just purchased it for a nephew. Looks nice on the coffee table too!"
5,Great game,My family and I really enjoyed this game. Good quality product. Word of advice. Dont leave it where the dogs can get to it. They didnt like it as much I guess since they ate all the pieces.
4,Needed it for a summer college course,This book is an easy and entertaining read. The stories are engaging and refreshing to read and to delve into.Highly recommend purchasing and reading this book.
4,A glaring omission,"The book is well done except the authors failed to include the ethnicity that was and continues to be among the largest immigrant group, the Irish. The authors dropped the ball on that one."
1,The Beauty Supplier did not provide the activator as paid for,The supplier did not provide the activator as promised. I do not recommend this company.
4,Way overpriced,"I've had this installed on my contractor's saw for over a year now. It works great. Kickback almost eliminated. Recently the spring on one of the anti-kickback pawls broke. I fixed it, then it broke again. The thing still works though. The pawls are adjusted to hold the wood very very tight. Sometimes too tight. All in all, it's a great product, and should be priced at around $50 to $75 dollars."
5,Wonderful device but a pain to install....,"I bought this device to replace the factory provided splitter provided by Grizzly because I got tired of wrenching off three bolts every time I wanted to use my crosscut sled or cut a dado. This device is simplicity itself to take off or put on but the initial installation is a royal pain!I struggled for an hour and a half to line up the splitter with my blade because the blade has to be on to facilitate the allignment, but must be off to tighten the bolts. My advice is to first snug up the bolts as tight as you can and still allow movement and then clamp a piece of wood to the saw table against the blade and splitter to maintain the position after blade is removed. Tighten down the bolts and recheck the alignment. It took me a half-dozen attempts to get it right. Good luck!"
5,Biesemeyer comes up with another winner,"My Delta saw came with a Biesemeyer fence system,which I found to be a high quality addition to my saw. After using serval types of aftermarket splitters, I purchased the Biesemeyer splitter. As with all things Biesemeyer, precise alignment is the key to installation. My first test was ripping curly cherry. No more binding with a chance of kickback! Once installed the splitter and anti-kickback pawls work superbly."
2,Install a pain in the as...,"Spreader seems to work fine after you get it lined up with blade. That is a matter of trial and error. Since Biesemeyer is owned by Delta, and Delta makes the Unisaw, one would thing the spreader mounting braket could be designed to self align with the bade. For the price it should."
2,What has happened to Delta Products?,"The first unit would not allow the spreader to snap/lock into it's frame, so I returned it and just received another one which the spreader locked into OK. After installing and straightening the item to the table, the spreader was offset from the blade by more than 1/8th of an inch,.....top and bottom! Due to the resctictive lower bolt hole, in this device, there is no lateral adjustment available to line the spreader up with the blade. I have a 2006 left tilt 36-L31X Unisaw and according to the information for this item, it should have worked on my saw. I contacted Delta for advise...they had no answer, and said to return the item. I noticed that the spreader metal is quite soft as it was not straight right out of the box. I suppose this may be for minor adjustments. The anti kick back units are also quite soft as one of those was bent and laying against the spreader. Definitely not the quality of Delta of yesteryear!"
2,"Nice DVD, the movie... not so much.","I had seen this movie years and years ago and was excited to see it available on DVD. However, as in so many memories, this movie did not live up to expectations on re-watching.The plot drags terribly for most of the movie, with the David Farrar character feeling oh-so sorry for himself and his girlfriend inexplicably standing by him. Even in a peacetime movie this would be tiresome, but to have someone sitting more or less safely in London whining about his foot pain while so many fellow Brits were dying by the thousands is pretty annoying.The climactic bomb disposal scene is great, but it just hints at how good this movie *could* have been.The DVD extras are superb, with interviews with a cameraman and snippets from a biography that talk a lot about Powell & Pressburger and their other films."
5,Cute Poodles,"These greeting cards are soooo cute! I own a white poodle, but you don't have to be an owner of one to appreciate this card. The dogs on this card are absolutely precious! They make a nice replacement for reindeer. Everyone I gave one of these cards to this Christmas thought it was so adorable!"
5,Fan of Chris Bell,"Chris Bell's music magic lives on after he does. It's like a missing part of Big Star...the music is all there but there is a sadness. ""Though I know she lies"" is a great listen. And the David Bell's story is something all Big Star fans should have to read and remember."
5,Magnificent,"This disc is worth the price of purchase for the liner notes compiled by Chris' brother David alone. The music, of course, is excellent.As with the three Big Star re-issues which came out at about the same time as this album, you could comfortably curl up with the liner notes to this CD and a cup of coffee and drop out for the evening. The story is tragic - and leaves you wishing for more. Unfortunately, this is undoubtedly all you're going to get.Perhaps that is why I continue to return to this album, when all the others fade, years after finding it. I even re-read the liner notes.No other album in my collection sustains itself like this one."
4,Four-and-a-Half Star Guitar Pop Essential,"If Big Star's Radio City and #1 Record are five star records, this is four-and-a-half. The high points are just as high (the title track, You and Your Sister), the weakest tracks maybe a bit weaker. There is a real melancholy beauty to this music. It creates its own atmosphere.Liner notes are rarely worth mentioning, but the ones here (by Bell's brother) are fascinating, telling the story of the recording and mixing of these tracks in Europe, including a brief encounter with Paul McCartney at Abbey Road. Bell's is a sad story in many ways, and his depression is palpable on Cosmos. One of those artists who was severely underappreciated in his too-short lifetime and still underrated today."
5,Best training book ever!,This is one of the most insightful books about dog behavior I have ever read. This is the book Richard Wolters based his training techniques on.
2,"Good concept, poor execution","I've had this mobile base for five years. The concept is great; a low profile base for occasional moving of a heavy tool, but sturdy and immobile during use. Unfortunately, the extension on the wheel lift suffered a broken weld after a couple of years use. Since I only moved the saw four times, that's unacceptable performance. There's only a small weld that fixes the extension bar to the lift plate, so check it carefully if you get one of these bases or you may face an expensive repair later!"
1,DOES NOT FIT 729-732 saws,This base was advertised for the 20-729--732 table (cabinet saws) IT DOES NOT FIT THESES SAWS!!!! if you need the base for this saw order the Delta 50-729 base + extension for longer rails if needed.I will say that it appears to be well built and would be fine IF IT FIT MY SAW
4,Would only make one change,"This base took about 20 minutes to put together. And that includes five minutes for bandaging my finger after cutting it on one of the staples from the box. The saw fits perfectly, of course. It did require me to reposition the legs for the side extension, as the base was narrower then I originally had the legs.One item that I like about the HTC base that this doesn't have is the ability to change the position(s) of the fixed wheels. I have a tight spot between my bench and the garage wall that I'm sliding this saw into and the positioning of the fixed wheels requires me to come in at an awkward angle and move three other tools to have enough room to swing the table around. That's why I only give it four stars. Otherwise, a top notch accessory."
1,Not the right one,"The Delta 50-289 comes up as a suggested purchase when buying a Unisaw with a 52"" fence. This is NOT the correct base for this saw. The correct one is the Delta 50-257Delta Industrial 50-257 for 36-L352 or 36-L552 Unisaws with 52-Inch Biesemeyer Fence"
2,Disgusted!!!!,"I am disgusted! This is a decent built base however, it will not fit a Delta Unisaw with the cast iron base extension. The saw I am I using is an older Unisaw. I called Delta Tech assistance and was told they do not make a base for the older Unisaws. I also asked if they receive the same question often and the answer was ""yes."" I did not see any technical info about this on Amazon.com when I ordered this item. I did not have the time to build my own mobile base and thought I would save some time by purchasing this item. I now have to spend a few hours cutting it apart and making it wider to fit my saw. I feel this item is misrepresented by not informing the would be buyer that it may not work for their saw. I am still disgusted!!!"
1,Disappointed,"Unit flexes at the point where extension joins the main base. This leads to an unstable and potentially dangerous operation of saw and router. I noticed that Delta produces this unit in China (no intentions to bash China) and it is likely that inferior (soft) steel was used, or at minimum a gauge of steel that is inappropriately thin for this application. I don't trust this base and am now looking at a replacement (HTC/made in the US?)"
4,Mobile Base,Good general construction. Weld quality fair. Instructions OK but error in tools needed not SAE as stated but Metric. Extra parts with kit. It does it's job. I got it for a fantastic price here !!! @ 50% of the local store and faster - Bravo AMAZON !!
2,"I'll take the Reader's Digest Edition, Please!","This is the memorable true story of two unigue American Combat units, one all Black and the other made up of immigrants some thought were to dumb to deserve citizenship, and their extraordinary contributions to the war effort on The Western Front during WWI. In hard combat each battalion was caught behind enemy lines in the 1918 Allied offensive. After the war each of the units sterling record of service and sacrifice were again lost, this time in America. There's a great story here but its too often buried under a suffocating mountain of textbook prose."
3,Cool deal!,"I bought this because i love this year of madden, the only problem i have is with either my xbox or the game itself. I can't seem to play it on my xbox 360, it works on my regular xbox so i am not complaining."
4,Great game,"I love this game. I only wish Madden did play by play announcement, like in the older versions of madden. Been a long time since I have owned a console. Last one I owned was sega. So controls are strange to me , but easy to learn"
4,08 MADDEN (XBOX),"The key for me is being able to make defensive adjusments with the line. It does look better than last year, a little. As a owner of the 360 also, that line adjustment feature should have been in the 360 version as well.Fun to play, but still can't make half time adjustment cause that option is grayed out. Been that way on all the Maddens.Love the game save feature, every game should allow you to save a game in progress."
1,The Cave,"The amateurish way McGowan writes makes his efforts painful to read.His other books, ""Trash Haulers"" and ""Anything, Anywhere, Anytime"" are slanted and poorly done. He portrays himself as an expert on tactical airlift but so many of his assertions are simply incorrect.It's an unfortunate reality that so many of McGowan's ""facts"" are nothing more than war-stories. And we all know how those start."
4,"This is Balakirev, not Glinka","This CD set is just fine, and nice to see, since Balakirev can be hard to find. But the composer is all Balakirev, not Glinka, Chopin, Beethoven, etc. Whoever wrote the notes was confused by what ""Transcriptions"" are. They are Balakirev's compositions based on Glinka, Chopin, etc."
4,Media center! and that it is......,"This was a very time consuming project to assemble........blah. Not difficult to assemble, but very time consuming. It really does hold ""tons"" of ""media"", It has all kinds of room in it for cd, dvd's, games, and maybe game paddles, but b/c of the set up none of our game consoles would fit...leaving the issue of where to put them....If you put them on the top of the media cabinet then you can not access the open top (the only lockable section) without moving everything....so that is a bit of a pain. I gave it a 4 b/c I guess it did what it was suppose to and the quality is good, but not a 5 b/c I was hoping I could use it to store my ps2, ps3 , my wii, and possibly my cable box..........so long story short I put all my consoles on top and don't use the top lock part. (one of the reasons I got it was for the lock...lol...figures.)"
4,great case at a great price,great storage case. even holds all my dvd's and blue ray disc. easy to assemble (with 2 people) took us about 10 minutes. my brother liked it so much he ordered 1 also
2,VERY DIFFICULT & TIME CONSUMING TO BUILD!,"Very difficult to build and was unable to complete it correctly! The person (or company) that I purchased the item from told me they would send me a refund as they have had MANY complaints about this item and they never did. The item was missing many parts and I had to improvise by purchasing parts from the hardware store. Pretty much, money wasted. Lots of problems and looks cheap. The parts are from China and although cookie cutter, VERY difficult...you can do it in...oh, I'd say 9 hours if you rush and get everything right!"
3,the calling,typical PRIDE VIDEO movie. at least this was made after the 1st round of videos that featured nealy no ADULT scenes. i give it a three for the beautiful young men.
4,An Eclectic Look at the Sounds that Move our Soul,"If you were expecting to travel down a solitary path, progressing from chant to chant with a single sense of unity, Chant by Robert Gass may not be the first choice for you in exploring the impact of spiritual harmonics. It is eclectic, and in its eclecticism you have a chance to experience the diversity of man's devotion to the 'one true God' as he experiences it. In this eclecticism you are pulled in many directions and find yourself frequently deciding in your mind, ""I like this one, I don't like that one."" About the third play through you then begin to experience the beauty of diversity. Then you are willing and eager to listen to all of God's names and you experience the joy that diversity can bring.Chant is for the patient and the commited aspirant, who seeks a deeper truth in understanding the 'sound of God'."
3,Sanskrit words mispronounced,"I just clicked on the Gayatri Mantra from the Amazon web site to hear a sample of the tunes on this CD, and was astonished that the words to that ancient mantra are being grossly mispronounced by the artist. I listened to a few more tunes and thought they were pleasing to the ear, but just cannot bring myself to purchase a CD with such a glaring error on it as the one I mention above."
2,"Poor design, & materials",I have another stock feeder from which I base my comments. The support arm structure is cludgy to set up proper tension against stock. Motor is under powered and gets hot to the touch after 45 min. (I'm feeding small pieces and taking off very little material). Wheels are not round and made of a material that far inferior to true rubber wheels. I had to sand down the wheels just so they would grip the stock. It claims 46 fpm but my other feeder (max 42 fpm) pushes stock through faster. This is more a toy than a tool. If I could return it I would.
4,Great for the price,"I've had no problems w/ my stock feeder on my 3HP shaper. Adjusted properly, it pushes everything through with no problems and makes operating the shaper much safer.For setup, you simply need a thin piece of wood around 3/16"" thick. You set this on top of the piece of stock that you will be feeding and place it under the metal housing of the feeder (not under the wheels). Now position and tighten all the clamps. The feeder will now be in the right position with the proper amount of downward pressure on the stock."
4,Excellent for home shop,"I bought this unit based on reviews and price. I have a home shop that I use to make alot of the trim for my new house on a 1hp ShopFox shaper out of 3/4"" MDF. This unit works great for my needs. It's a bit tricky to adjust and I usually burn a couple of pieces of scrap wood to dial it in, but after that it's excellent. The wheels could be a bit grippier, but I'm sure with some light sanding they'd be better. The adjustable feature is great. The best part is that it keeps my hands away from the bit and allows me to setup the next piece to pass through and stack the previous piece while the feeder/shaper do the work."
1,What to say,"Wow, this was just on tv, and nothing else on so thought I'd give it a go. It's bad. Really bad. The acting is horrid. The dialog is ridiculous. The effects very low grade. The story was dumb, with a stupid 'twist' at the end, which was basically they made up something last minute at the end just to be a surprise. Uh yeah, so anyway, if your looking for something to go to sleep to, you won't miss much with this one, so it'll do the trick."
4,Great Movie!!!!,"This is unlike your garden variety mass killing movie. You will truly be suprised by the ending and the identity of the killer. (I'm not gonna tell you, you need to see it!) The cast is well put together, and despite this being a horror film, I found myself laughing at times during the movie. ( I like a horror film with funny parts in it) You get to feel the whole range of human feeling. I would definitely see this movie again, and I would suggest it to my friends."
1,Inaccurate research.,"The book in general is full of inaccuracies. For example, the section on the Rokon Trail-breaker is mostly fiction. The author attributes the creation of the Trail-breaker to J.B. Nethercutt and his two sons. This is absolutely false. Charles Fehn of Thousand Oaks, California invented it not the Nethercutts. Nethercutt owned the company that was its first mass producer not its inventor."
5,Classic American Motorcycles are all here to view!!!,"I purchase this item mainly as a reference tool for an upcomingart project that has storytelling pages which would includemotorcycles from the 1930's. What I got was an excellentbargain and a great book with amazing detail.I admire the history of the American Motorcycle and the picturesthis volume display. It's very useful as a tribute to theearly invention of the vehicle and shows wonderful progressionto what we know today as the modern motorcycle.Excellent book to have on hand to learn and explore,regardlessof whether you like motorcycles or not."
5,The Most Amazing Book!,"Jan Phillips has a most wonderful way of explaining this so that you really ""get"" it. I have been trying to understand these things my whole life...now I do!Everyone should read this. It is written to a more female audience but most of the information is valuable for men too."
2,Slightly disappointed,"The saw has sufficiant power and some good features. Advertisments lead you to believe the saw will handle 2X (nominal) stock. The saw will make a 45* cut with the arm swung to the left but with the arm positioned to the right the stock will not reach the fence without contacting the blade. 1"" stock works well. The supplied partical board table was warped and is still on back order since Feb. Several calls to customer support, the solution was to offer a full refund toward the purchase price of the 220 volt 12 saw. If your needs include cutting greater than 5/4 consider the 12"" saw."
4,delta 10in radial arm saw,"the delta 10in radial arm saw is one of the best on the market,one big factor is ,how easy and quick you can square the saw.this is the most important factor,on a radial arm saw,a out of square saw is useless.the saw is quility made.all steel no plastic.made to last a live time."
5,Incredible shipping speed....,I got exactly what I ordered even it was not what I meant to order... but that is all my fault. Ordered one day and here the next.
2,Billy Idiot,Happy Gilmore is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Then I watched Billy Madison and it was about a totally moronic spoilt rich kid. Total opposites sometimes don't atract.
3,Where It All Began,"It is hard to believe that after Memorial Day that Sandler will have made 12 movies since these. Both of these movies are worth repeated watches; however, don't be fooled by the ""new bonus features"". The deleted scenes are far less produced that the final film, and the dialogue is almost impossible to hear in some scenes. The bloopers are not that funny either. That being said, these are still two fine movies. The main draw to me for the combo set was that I could get the widescreen version which I had previously been unable to find. If this is not important to you, you will probably be better off trying to find them separately. Finally, each movie on its own is worth 4 stars, but I knocked down my rating because of what I have mentioned above."
2,1/4 of the movies,"these are some of the best movies of all time!but some very important scenes were cut out of the movies.Like in Happy Gillmore when Happy gets even with Ben Stiller,Also in Billy Madison when Billy plays kickball.These scenes were cut from this collection.I reccomend buying the whole movie."
2,Carmelites,The opera dragged on and I didn't think it was ever going to end. The voices were wonderful but the cast was horrble. I do not reccomend this opera at all.
5,renewed vitality,"This is my first Ono albumn and I'm glad that I bought it. Even the tracks with disco beats sound good and I'm a mostly classical music lover. I've always been intrigued by Ono's music when I've had the chance to hear it, so I bought a copy of Milk and Honey and Season of Glass to compare them with Walking on Thin Ice. Ono succeeds in creating a brand new work of art by her inspired programming. I'm looking forward to my next Ono CD from amazon.com."
3,The Most Known Unknown,"Don't fall for the hype. Yoko Ono's music is different, but not bizarre. Sure, she yelps and screams and moans on a few songs, but if anything that makes the case that her music was ahead of its time. I especially like the Bluesy-Rock of ""Death of Samantha"" and the Reggae-Pop of ""Don't Be Scared"". Her songs are unique; her voice is distinctive. This is not for Mariah fans."
3,Greatest Hits! How?,"Yoko-san should not be a recording artist. Instead, she is a shrewd businesswoman. Frankly, if I were part of an aspiring band, I would love to have Yoko Ono manage us.This collection of ""greatest hits"" proves this point. The musicians she has accompanying her do an admirable job. However, Yoko's vocal talents. . . well. . . .what can I say? True, there have been others with voices that were extremely limited; Bob Dylan comes immediately to mind, who were very successful. However, unlike Yoko-san, these individuals had other musical talents that Yoko doesn't have.John's guitar work on ""Walking on Thin Ice"" is fanatstic. Elephants Memory member, Stan Bronstein, plays a mean, blues Sax on ""Death of Samatha."" Unfortunately, Yoko's vocals greatly detract from the honest musicianship featured on these tracks. I believe that the songs on these tracks could all be hits if another female artist, instead of Yoko, sang and recorded them."
1,how can you listen to this stuff?,"No matter how much you would want to like her music I don't see how you could. She is just plain awful and there is no excuse. Why don`t you people listen to Japanese singers with actual talent? Megumi Hayashibara for example, her songs are much better even though she sings in Japanese. She has a hell of a better voice than yoko."
3,?????,"Honestly, is it possible people enjoy this because she is Lennon's widow? Suppose that this were some random Asian woman with a bad accent. Singing meaningful lyrics, poorly, would you still listen?"
1,Dark,"Weird, scary and ""gothically"" BAD vibes. But then what do you expect from the witch who helped destroy John Lennon."
4,Another Motown CD,"This is your typical Motown cd.. packed with classics that will take you back to the days when live was easy.. and love was the goal.. From the classics Never Say Goodbye with its sweet melody to the upbeat rhythm of Get It Together.. and the unforgettable Sixteen Candles.. This is a cd to get together with your friends and reminisce or hook up with your sweetie and ""get it together""."
4,Beads for more than just jewlery,"i found this bk in the library. usually i just photocopy the good ideas but there were too many so i need to buy the book. its a great price for a hardcover with good detailed photos. make jewlery, buttons or beaded curtains. embellish pillows, screens, scarves and albums. fun beautiful stuff! enjoy!"
3,Expensive,"Well, this does work and it fits exactly right. But, be very careful when cutting small parts with a thin dado blade because the workpiece can fall below the insert.In other words, if you are cutting a 1/4"" dado there is a lot of open area where stuff can fall. If you are cutting thin dados, your workpiece should be at least three inches wide, and that still is not very stable.If you use a your dado blades a lot, I recommend that you create inserts (using zero clearance inserts) for dados between 1/4"" and 5/8"". I've got two inserts--3/8"" and 5/8"". The danger of parts falling below the insert is just too high.And geez, this seems expensive. Zero clearance inserts are about $22 and I think they work better."
3,Delta Dado Insert,"Sadly, I found the same insert at Sears for half the price and better made. The leveling screws on this insert are phillips, but the Sears product uses allen screws which are better. Otherwise, both inserts are identical."
4,Not bad,This dado insert works just fine. The only flaw is the leveling screws are philips head screws and not allan screws.
1,"Pooly made, avoid this purchase.","The adjustment screws were not able to be used, and this is too bad, since the insert itself was not uniformly the same thickness. One corner stood above the table top, even with the adjustment screw totally removed. This was not a useable item. I'm sorry that I bought it. You can do much better by making one of your own out of plywood, which is what I ended up doing."
1,disappointed and sleeping in seatle,"As much as I enjoy most of Linda Lael Miller's books this was one of her all time worst. I rated it one because zero wasn't an option. Weak plot and characters, it seemed these two characters were only interested in the mutual sex they shared, which was OK but without depth or emotion it was SO pointless. I become very annoyed with these great authors such as Nora Roberts, Elizabeth Lowell, Sandra Brown and of course Linda L Miller who re-release this drivel and we buy it expecting so much more. Keep an eye on those publishing dates, to be sure."
4,Mixed Messages,"Having read many of Linda Lael Miller's books, I found Mixed Messages a complete delight. Even though the longer novels usually interest me most, the story of Carly and Mark had so much spark and wonderful chemistry, I couldn't help but find it one of my favorites. It's great to see a determined female use her brain and help both she and her man win at the game of love and life. The story has just enough character development and conflict to make this a great romance read. Can't wait for more Miller romance like this."
2,Boring!,"This book made no sense. She goes from being an advice columnist (a poor one) to being an investigative reporter in about 12 seconds. Hard to believe, especially someone who was so shallow and lugged a makeup case with her everywhere she went! There was no chemistry between the two lead characters, no reason given as to why they were attracted to each other, and virtually no plot development. Not worth the read, glad I bought it used!"
3,Needs some improvement,"The Clock Tower is better than I thought it would be. I like the many levels of play (3 including 2 directions in the middle level) and I like that it rings when a train goes through it. However, it does not ring every time. I'm not sure why, but sometimes a train will go through and nothing will happen and then one will go through a minute later and it will ring. The biggest downfall is the sound. Normally I think kids' toys are too loud, but this clock tower's chime and music is not loud enough. When you have 4 trains running, the noise from them all really covers up a lot of the sound from the clock tower and it can be kind of hard to hear. But overall my son loves it and has a blast playing with it and I guess that's what most important."
3,Lesser Cole,"Bad Vibes starts well with Morning is Broken and So You'd Like to Save the World and ends pretty well with 4 M.B. (one of those ""who's it about?"" songs), but in between there is not much to get excited about. Call this a tame CD. Very soft arrangements, the usual cynical romantic well-crafted lyrics, all of it with little staying power in my book. Sometimes Cole's vocals are so laid back they're barely audible in the already quiet mix. Can't Get Arrested in particular meanders on entirely too long. Mister Wrong and My Way to You are the only other cuts I'd consider keepers."
4,Another classic Lloyd,"I pretty much like all of LC's albums. Some are mellower, some more acoustic, or more strings, or more country, but the lyrics are always funny/biting/sad & his singing is consistently strong.Bad Vibes has some louder guitar, some obvious Beatles/Lennon homages, & the last song is a nice tribute to T. Rex's Marc Bolan.Musically, Bad Vibes is up among his top 5 CD's. If anything, I think the production on his 1st CD has aged the worst, though the songs remain strong.Looking forward to hearing his 2011 CD as soon as it arrives in the mail. No more CD stores in my town...I've seen him solo in the mid-90's, with The Negatives in 2000 & solo again in San Fran in 2009. He's a great performer, & if you get a chance to talk to him, Lloyd is a humble, intelligent gentleman (just as you'd imagine).How he smokes & keeps his voice so smooth is a mystery to me."
1,BUY AN EXTRA POWER FEEDER BASE INSTEAD,"I bought this base and never installed it. The idea of clamping a power feeder to a machine table never seemed safe to me and also you are limited to a corner mount. Instead get an extra base from Delta, part number 1347994 will get another base for $34.47. Then you just unscrew the power feeder from one base and screw it to down on another base."
4,BLOODY,THE REASON I GAVE 4 STARS IS BECUZ I HAVE SEEN THE UNCUT VERSION AND THERE ARE ALOT OF SCENES OF PEOPLE BEING RIPPED APART/BASICALLY 2 GRANDMAS (ACTUALLY AUNTIES) CELEBRATE THEIR BIRTHDAY AND INVITE THE FAMILY OVER/THEY RECEIVE A MYSTERIOUS BOX OPEN IT AND A MIST PERMEATES OUT CAUSING THEM TO TURN INTO DEMON LIKE MONSTERS/THEY THEN GO ON A RAMPAGE AND START MUTILATING EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY/THE TROMA VERSION OF THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS CUZ THEY CUT OUT EVERY BIT OF GORE AND THEY ARE USUALLY KNOWN FOR OVER THE TOP GORE/DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS COPY ON DVD/YOU CAN HOWEVER FIND A COPY OF THE UNCUT VERSION ON VHS FROM A NUMBER OF PLACES THAT I WILL NOT SAY
2,A C-side from the B-movie masters,"Rabid GranniesThe opening is very effectively done, presenting distasteful characters who will be presumably eaten, but then it stews in its own mediocrity for a long time and never really gets into full swing. It builds expectations that are never realized, and it comes off as a major disappointment. If some effort had been placed in character development, clever humor, or special effects, it may have had appeal.2/5"
3,"Gosh, how do you rate a movie like this?","Last night I had a Troma double feature. ""Mother's Day"" and ""Rabid Grannies""! I'd say expect the unexpected but you know its Troma so thats obvious! The film is absolutely idiotic in everyway possible! I say that respectfully.. it starts off extremely slow for atleast 30 minutes or more untill the two nice grannies get a present delivered. The mysterious gift is opened and it releases a demonic smoke that tranforms the two grannies into, well... demons! The two newly evil elders reek havoc on their greedy house guest whom are only there to try and get in on the family fortune. Expect poor dubbing, bad audio, bad acting, silly effects and more when viewing ""Rapid Grannies"" and you'll be fine. Remember starts off painfully slow but has its rewards for fans of this type of garbage cinema! Others, you've been warned!""Mother's Day"" from Troma ***1/2 recommended, a real Troma treat!"
3,Dead Alive?,"This film looks alot like the movie Dead Alive. The way it was shot and the location looked the same. I dont think the movie was as gory as promised but did have some good gore. The monsters looked really corny and I thought it was very slow at times. As always, Troma always puts the best extras on there dvds. Worth watching at least once."
1,Absolute crap,"Despite a good title, Rabid Grannies disappoints in all levels and the dubbing is so horrible that your better watching this crap with subtitles. The movie is plotless and very pointless with very little gore(The DVD version is R-rated and the special features include deleted scenes that feature the bloody effects on the Unrated version). A bunch of people in a mansion celebrate a kids birthday party and two grandma's get rabies and start killing all. Rabid Grannies shouldn't be in the Troma industries and just burned in toxic waste. If you want a good Troma movie try Toxic Avenger or even that chessy,low-budget Redneck Zombies."
3,So Bad It's Good!,"If you're looking for a movie with a plot you should know you won't ever find it in a gore movie. The gore is funny, disgusting, and just down right sick. I liked that! If it wasn't for all of the extras and trailers filled with porn type materials I would have given this movie a 5 star. No where in the movie databases did I find that this DVD contained so much nudity but it does. The movie itself just has one scene that isn't to risky however the PSA and other trailers on this DVD are what I consider soft porn material. It's still worth buying so pick one up before you can't get your hands on thease grannies any longer."
2,What a disapointment,Well I just want do say first of all do not buy the dvd version of this film it is cut to shreds (I canot believe troma would do this)but it shows the cut gore sceens in the extras option but still there is music playing during the sceens I would have been a little happier if the actual sound from the movie was playing during the cut sceens but it's not they really need to put this out in a full directors cut with the original gore then this movie would get a 4 or 5 star.
3,okay,"I have a lot of music, to be fair, & am probably exposed to more music of this genre than the general ""public"". This is fine, however I have many more cds that are better in both native american music and new age music. The title is what snagged me since I recently particpated in a Medicine Wheel ceremony. Get it if you like to add to your collection, however, if you are looking for the best of the best, in my humble opinion you should keep looking."
2,Delta 50-302 Outfeed Table,"How can a packing box have no damage and the contents have damaged corners? Mine does and the box is in great condition.I just got mine and it has damaged corners. Maybe the table is damaged prior to packaging? I will be able to repair but, the price is high for the quality."
2,Delta extension,"I got this when I ordered my Delta saw several years ago. After using it, I've decided to build my own. The unit seems to have developed a slight bow with time."
2,Delta 50-302 Outfeed table,"This product arrived from CPO Delta by UPS. The corners of the folding portion of the out feedtable were damaged in shipping. The instructions are poorly written and overly complicated. The dado grooves for the mitre gauge are excessively large and I intend to fit these with hardwood fillers with the appropriate dado. On the plus side, the fixed portion of the table extension is very handy and the folding feature works great and is very stable. I'm glad that I've added this feature to my Unisaw."
4,Sturdy & Easy to Assemble,"I installed the outfeed table on my Unisaw with no issues (the hinge lined up just fine for me). I also use the table as an outfeed for my planer from the other end (just have to watch when it reaches the cast table lip).Unfortunately, I follwed the directions and cut 1/2"" off (I don't understand why this was instructed). If I did it again, I'd leave it full length.A few minor annoyances: when the table is folded down, it covers the dust port. Also, there is a large opening in the front of the table for the blade guard which I don't use."
4,Shipment problems not fixed completely,"My table arrived (Nov 2001) with some minor damage (crushed corners and delamination), but it was not severe enough to send it back. I fixed it with a hammer, some glue, and a clamp. Yes, there was a note in the box saying that Delta had made an attempt at improved packaging. The damage should not discourage anyone (but the most particular) from ordering this product. By the way, it fit my platinum edition w/Biesemeyer fence perfectly."
2,"A great design .....BUT!..........Poor Packing , MDF Junk,","I hate to talk bad about an American company But this product is Junk, South of Boarder, Bargain basement 99cent store junk, Shame on you Delta. The packing for this product,,,,,Oops....What packing........I received mine with damaged corners but the shipping box didn't show any signs of damage,,,,,,Hum. and for Delta a company the make very high quality tools, I am very sad to see a MDF ( fiber board ) table.....Not a multi lam 15 ply type board it should have been made from. But the design it self is great, it folds away with ease and has channels for the miter gauge and blade guard. Delta just got cheap with a product that isn't cheap to buy ,,,,,,,,Just be aware it's function is great the hardware is great, the table...!"
4,good product,"well constructed, good instructions, but the angled suupports were to long and did not line up with the holes in the saw cabinet. the large table was not very flat, but considering all it does is support long work pieces, it works great."
1,jumpstart guide pentax k 10 d,"This product is a sham. The info is good but the speaker on the dvd talks so fast it is extremely difficult to follow, concept to concept. I have never heard anyone talk so fast, the pace is abnormal, sort of like he was running out of time. I will never buy another jumpstart guide on any other subject."
4,Great Tutorial DVD!,"I was very pleased with my transaction. The DVD arrived as promised and it was sealed, brand new. The tutorial is excellent, you don't need to pay for expensive classes to learn how to operate your camera. Well worth it!"
4,book marks,"This book of book marks made a great addition to a gift that was a book. plus, you dont have to worry about losing one of them since you have more and they are inexpensive."
3,Tiffany Bookmarks,The bookmarks are lovely and very useful for all ages. They're also a good buy as they can be separated and given to individual youngsters or adults.
3,A couple good ones in there,"Some of the bookmarks were pretty, but a lot were boring with a lot of brown tones. Also, many were off center. They are okay, but I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Disappointing,These bookmarks came attached to each. You had to tear them apart at the perforations which didn't leave clean edges. Guess you get what you pay for.
5,Usual Design - Very Functional!,"I purchased a ton of these in different designs, as I read more than one book at a time so I can pick up where I left off. These bookmarks work very well."
1,Just a waste,"I buy a lot of things, but this was just a stupid purchase. I can cut out construction paper into a bookmark shape and it would work as well as this piece of paper."
4,Bookmarks,"Flexible card board book marks, They are OK.and will obviously do the job. Not something I would re-order unless I needed aninexpensive item to add to my order to avoid shipping charges!!"
2,Cheap Bookmark: Need to tear off along perforation,"Despite the low price, I was disappointed that it was such cheap bookmarks that you have to tear off along the perforated edge. The perforated side is not smooth and looks unattractive. The paper quality is also not very thick and really cheap. I could use a piece of paper instead of a bookmark, if I didn't care about the feel, quality, and appearance. I will never buy another bookmark from this company, or any other company who care so little about the quality of their product."
3,Nice bookmarks,Good item to buy if you need the extra amount for free shipping.Some of the bookmarks are really very pretty.
3,Cardboard bookmarks,"They're pretty, plastic would have been nicer, as the other reviewer stated ""they do the job""And yes, I did use them as ""fillers"" to avoid shipping charges. hehehe"
5,An exceptional tome. I have bought them for all my staff....,"This handy little book is one of the best small references,I've ever come across in the medical field. It's quick, at a glance graphics and simple explantions have me saying to my staff: Have you checked ""In my pocket""?They know to look there first. Kudos to Ms. Martineau!!!"
4,"Christmas With Eddy ""Average"" Arnold","I'm not a huge country music fan but I love Christmas songs recorded in the 40's, 50's and 60's. Songs on this CD recorded 1960 and 1961. I like some of the less popular selections: ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away,"" ""Up On The Housetop,"" & ""Jolly Old Saint Nicholas."" Mixing some of these songs with other Christmas CDs wouldn't be so bad...but the tempo on every song is quite slow. Almost a bit depressing after 5 songs. If you're wanting to add to your ""vintage Christmas collection,"" then buy this CD. Otherwise, I'd recommend Johnny Mathis, Perry Como or Al Martino."
3,gets the job done,"I have had one of these for at least 10 years (Xmas gift). Made in China, so very cheaply made, but no issues, ever. It is pretty compact (won't fit glove box though). The analog gauge is pretty vague, so I generally over inflate a little and release pressure in small increments. I have a digital pressure gauge for my car tires. It works ok with the engine off (ACC on), but it works much better (faster) when the engine is running and it is getting full power. This makes it annoying to use during the winter in northern climates when the garage door has to be closed and you can't really run the engine. I have been trying to find a converter so I can plug it into an AC outlet.Anyone know how many amps these things use/run (not on unit nor box)?Anyone know a (cheap) DC to AC adapter/converter to use in a garage?"
1,No go 1st up,"The first time I tried to hook it up to the tire using the nifty PLASTIC nozzle the worthless hunk of junk broke and rendered the item inert. It now resides in a landfill; a far, far better place indeed. Buy one for someone you don't like."
3,Be gentle,"The third or fourth time I used the compressor on my bicycle tires, the end of the attachment where it hooks to the valve stem broke."
5,K911 Emergency First Aid Video a must have,I own a Dog Owner First Aid Training business and when i was looking for a video to use for my course this is the one I purchased and reccommend. Clear concise and to the point. A must have for all dog people. This is a good addition to anyones home or business.
5,First-Aid for Dogs,Learn CPR for dogs and how to handle many common kinds of dog emergencies. We feel more confident taking our dog into the wilderness knowing we can take care of him. Every dog owner should view this tape at least twice. Great gift idea for dog lovers. Recommended by our dog trainer.
3,It does something,This stuff does whiten your teeth by a shade or two after a few weeks of regular use.
3,seems to have side effects,"Not very pleased with this product.It has good taste, and it might restore soft spots on teeth and strengthen enamel, but in addition, it also makes my teeth sensitive and my mouth dry.Upon discontinuing its use the symptoms went away, but came back when I restarted using the mouthwash.PS- I don't normally suffer from sensitive teeth."
2,Yawn!,"This biography is only for the most hard core fans of the Queen and the monarchy of the UK. It is extremely slow moving and the interesting parts are few and far between. I usually devour books of this sort, but the author concentrates too much on miniscule political facts and musings rather then on the life of the Queen. Perhaps this book would have been better titled ""British politics and the reign of Elizabeth II."" Ms Longford's book is a much better biography of this grand lady."
2,"Don't bother, unless you enjoy being bored","I felt like I was reading a newspaper report: lifeless, dull, ""just the facts, ma'am."" The author rarely delved into details about the Queen's personal thoughts and ideas. An example of the author's failure to provide details: upon describing the births of the Queen's second and third children (Anne, Princess Royal, and Andrew, Duke of York), he didn't even bother to tell us the names of the children!! This book reads like a long, boring summary of the Queen's various travels and activities with little to no commentary on the Queen's personality or personal thoughts and ideas."
3,"at around $35 per 8"" width this is a bit pricey.","After careful consideration (and checking my wallet) I opted to make my own. I mean, let's face it guys -and ladies- that's why we own these things in the first place. My first model of an extension worked perfectly, but that was geared to benchtop use with a set of support legs on the side. I just recently stuck the saw on a floorstand so previous model wouldn't work anymore. Phase two extention wing gives full 32"" cut width to blade and smoothe fence usage from stock to addon. Main trick is using hardwood on front edge pieces for fence to clamp on. I used 3/4"" mdf for the main area with a second strip glued to underside on table side for screws into side of table to go through. Route out slots for nuts, washers and end of bolts. Last addition is stop blocks under outside edge for 45 deg brace boards back to stand junction. Makes solid,sturdy and removable extension.My $0.02"
2,It doesn't fit well.,The rip fence doesn't track well with this extension. This is a major flaw that makes the extension less useful. The cost of the extension is way out of line for the quality.
2,Book,I received the item in perfect time. The only problem is that The book was in a worst condition that I expected.
4,Just what I expected,I ended up getting an B+ for this one credit course. The book was easy to read and to the point. There are great stories as well as etiquette instructions with good explanations in it as well. The etiquette book was required materials for the course.
5,"Cheesy cover, Highest Quality Sound","This disc is as good as Hooker's epochal Modern Records sides are ever going to sound. Transferred and mastered by Audiophile legend Steve Hoffman straight from the tapes and in a couple of cases, 78s, the sound is unbelievably pure for 1948-1954, alive, spacious (yes in mono!), warm, and clear. Unfortunately licensing prevented the use of some of the cream, but plenty of it is here, and the regular old milk is incredible itself.Worth every penny! Also look for the similarly awesome Lightnin' Hopkins SACD, Broken Hearted Blues."
3,"interesting choices, I think..am not sure","because of the inclusion of Culture Club, Eric Clapton, and 10CC (the same band that gave us ""I'm Not In Love"", that sappy 70's hit), it is difficult for me to give this lp high praise, BUT the mixing of Marley, Jimmy Cliff, and Marcia Griffiths from the old school, with Shaggy, Maxi Priest, Shaba, Beenie Man, and Ziggy, was an inspired idea that allows the listener to get a feel for where reggae has come from and where it is going.Skip over the 10cc, Clapton, and Culture Club (though I grudgingly accept how all 3 helped reggae in their own ways)and listen to the grooves. Not a bad lp at all."
5,Droll Yankee Hummingbird Feeders are the BEST!,"There is nothing like seeing beautiful little hummingbirds darting about their feeders, and observing their different feeding behaviors. Some of them sit on the side of their feeders and leisurely sip, and others continuously stay in mid air, performing amazing aerobatics. The Droll Yankee feeders allow us a birds-eye view, and their feeders are ""hummingbird friendly"" to the max. I own four of them, and keep them filled all the time for maximum viewing pleasure. Keep them filled all year round! You can get hours of pleasure watching these lovely creatures as they dart about your garden."
1,"Terrible to clean, hummers don't like it","I bought two of these and was very disappointed, they do not come apart (top and bottom) making cleaning them very difficult. I use the red hummingbird food and the hummers don't like this feeder, they peck at the top red portion and have trouble finding the food. If you use the clear food it will be harder to attract the hummers, but they still don't like this one very much. They like my strawberry feeders much better, and I do have some of those that stick on the window as well. I would highly suggest to skip this feeder, cleaning is important for their health, and they visit this feeder the least of all my feeders."
2,manual misses too much,"The manual is OK about what it does cover but it leaves way too much uncovered. If you are going to work on these cars, the Toyota filed service manual is the only good one that I know of. If you by this manual, then do not expect much or you will be disappointed.For example, consider replacing the fresh air or cabine air filter which is usually located behind the glove box. Turn to the index and search for filter or cabin or fresh or glove and you find NOTHING. The only mention of air filter is the engine intake air filter."
2,2 stars...,"I couldn't finish this regency.Though use of modern day langage in a regency is usually not a problem for me-it was so prevalent in this book that it severly took away from the story.Also,I found the idea of a gaming hell that not only let in, but actively sought out ""ladies of quality"" to gamble HIGHLY implausible. That, and the fact that this is a fresh faced 19 year old daughter of a Viscount in her debut season?!? That would have ruined her and any chance she had of a marriage to the hero, an Earl!If you're going to write a historical romance then the characters should behave and react as people would in that time period. The author needs to research regency language and behavior more for her next book.I'd say skip this book unless you can get it used or at the library.2 stars."
3,Boring but useful,"I used this book to pass the 70-290 exam.This book contains a lot of useful information.It is a great reference book too.This book is really boring. It is not a book that you will enjoy reading.It is a good book for experts and as a reference. For beginners who are just starting, I would recommend the QUE books."
2,"Thick, shallow, and full of technical errors","Thick, shallow, and full of technical errors. Don't go here lookng for answers, if you find them, they are equally likely to be from some prior (probably re-edited) windows 2000 manual, and sometimes just wrong! I read it from cover to cover...and it didn't get any better.MCSE, MCT, CCNA, SECURITY+ (etc)"
5,Great companion book!,"Got a new job as a sys-admin, and found this book to be very helpful! I have since upgraded the system to server 2008 r2, but every now and then need to use this book as well, so I still have it on hand. Great book if you are still using 2003 environments."
5,Comprehensive and very easy to read,Don't get scared by its size. I thought the contents were very well presented and easy to read & understand. I thougth notes about what one can avoid from the author's years of experience was very helpful and proved to be true in many occasions for me as well.I used this book to plan out a server deployment and migration for a client and I was very grateful for the deployment tips.
4,Certainly good but not their best,Another reviewer said it best after the breakup EPMD just wasn't the same. Even with that if your an EPMD fan you should have this in your collection and there are some cool songs. Also don't bother getting the limited edition. The greatest hits CD seems to have been remixed and just doesn't do justice to their original hits.
2,Alternately interesting and tedious,"This is an occasionally interesting study of the interplay among culture, religion, medicine, and kinship in Greece and the United States. I can't help thinking that Danforth could have made his point in 200 pages rather than 300. Also, I dislike a tendency towards legitimization of stigma toward mental illness and it's pharmaceutical treatments."
4,"Melancholic, soothing music","I have the lucky chance to find out about this group in Paris and was immediately taken by their music. This is not 'ranchero' music...it is melancholic, soothing, sweet music. This group is comprised of at least 2 generations of musicians and their love of the craft is evident."
4,Sassy Sexy Sax,"This album made Boots a household name. Having already been a studio musician for the likes of Elvis and Brenda to name just a few, he released this major album. The first 6 selections are yakety tunes and the remainder are slow melodies. Outstanding are 'Smoke Gets In Your Eyes' and 'I Really Don't Want To Know'. He surely crossed over from country to pop very very well. A companion to this album would be Boots with Knightbridge Strings. Great sax on both."
4,Truly a legend,"I've been listening to Boots for over 40 yrs. I had the honor to talk with him at his once owned resturant/stage in Printers Alley, Nashville. Boots was a down to earth person who spoke of his inspiration to play the horn at age 17. he told me that Earl Bostic's style impressed him and to my surprise the styles of Earl can be detected with Boots, However, Boots is tops and having played the tenor sax myself, I can feel the tremendous soul searhing Boots puts into his play. I personally enjoy his ballads, each and every one is played with 100% of what Boots, has to offer. Boots was born in 1927---somebody needs to advertise his music and give him the host of appreciation he deserves."
4,Fun Music,We purchased this CD as an accompaniment to our parrot's dancing. The music is fun and Boots Randolph is an amazing sax player.
4,Fun Music,"When I first heard this music I knew my little caique parrot would love to dance to it, and she does! What a trip!"
5,Boots Randolph Sax Review,A must for Boots Randolph fans. Good sonics that shows his musical and arranging skills. The sonics are done well for this CD. This is a good overall CD for someone who would like a good sampling of Boots Randolph music.
5,Awesome,"My daughter is 8 years old. She has an old overhead projector that she uses to play school with. ""Santa"" brought her this item and she absolutely loves it. I enjoy hearing her ""teach"" to the class. Perhaps this was meant for a teacher, but my daughter loves it."
1,"Poor quality, cannot replace net","I bought this for my son but within a year we began to have significant problems. The S-curves gradually fall off, and we are at the point that we want to buy a new replacement net, but unlike other companies (Louisvill Slugger for one), Easton does not sell a replacement net. So many of the s-hooks are gone now, it has no tension. For the 80$+ we had to pay for it, this is not worth the money. They should at least sell replacement hooks and a net. They give two stakes to anchor the pitch back to the ground, but it is not really enough. They need to give more. If you use it for anything besides a baseball (soccer for example, they say you casn I think), the rebounder will fall off. This is my first time writing a negatvie review, annoyed enough to do so. Note other companies have pitchbacks that do not have s-hooks, they use more permanent catches that should be better."
5,Smash Hit!,Magnificient -- I read this book in two days flat. It's written beautifully with deep attention to the cultural history of baseball in the '20s and '30s.
2,Bad Research?,"As I started to read this book, I am alarmed with his love fest for Oklahoma. Stating that 1 out of 10 Baseball players came out of Oklahoma? The Deans for example were born and lived in Arkansas. Warren Spahn was born and grew up in Buffalo NY. Carl Hubell was born in Missouri. I want to believe in the author and trust in his information but with his wild exageration about Oklahoma being the hotbed for baseball I begin to wonder if his research will be flawed as well. I have been to Oklahoma and stayed the night many times but I am not from there! For him to steal Paul and Dizzy Dean from Arkansas raises questions. They always claimed Arkansas as home."
5,Great product!,I am extremely happy with the whole Nioxin line. It works well for me and has made a noticable difference in my hair.
1,live or memorex?,"After listening to The Power of Love, it was clear that Celine was either lip syncing or singing along with a taped version of the song. Any musician can tell that the band behind Celine is not what's on the audio track: live performance does not sound exactly like ""the record"". The fact that you can't tell if Celine is really singing (on many songs) even makes this more disturbing. Applause is faded in and out like a laugh track on a sitcom."
2,nothing better than CD..,"I disappointed at this title. Video quality is not good. It's just like vhs tape. And there are only long-take camera walk. It's boring.. Sound quality not so good also ..Songs are good, But concert is not so good. It's absolutely not worth 4 stars.. (If you are not the loyal fan of her)If you have her CDs, you may don't want to have this dvd title. There are not much difference between the two format."
3,good video,Its a great video but she lipsynced almost every song. Dissapointing because Celine can really sing. But its a good video regardless.
5,Outstanding performance from one of the most talented,"This is one to collect. Duets are performed with the original artists like Peobo Pryson, et. al. Quality music production, audience response (including her parents), emotional performance -- Celine crys at the end. Add to this her incredible voice and talent."
2,Not a real concert!,"If you are a fan of Celine Dion, you will easily realize most songs she sang here are exactly the same as original CD version. Disappointedly, that means they were lipsynced or dubbed. Moreover, this shows some edited scenes regardless of music. So seeing this video like a can is not very exiting. And I don't like the third-rate dancers."
2,Such a great talent wasted on such an ill conceived video !!,"As is always the case, her talent as a singer of popular music comes close to being the all time greatest. However, the video portion of this DVD is, by almost any standard, inferior. Also, why would you have to have her lip sync all but one number ??Compare this DVD to The BeeGee's ""One Night Only"" and you will see the difference in both the video and audio."
3,Known Non-concert Concert!,"This ""Concert"" was MEANT TO BE a low-budget lip-synching videolized images of Celine Dion aimed at the English-speaking North American market in order to introduce this new personality to the public in moving images. It was filmed very early in the 90's, during the time when she began to put out a lot of English language songs, composed specifically to be launched as hits. She was not a mega-star at the time, hence the amateurish production value. When you buy something like this, you just have to be sophisticated enough to realize that this is not a real concert, and just enjoy it for what it is. Yes, the title is a little misleading (ALL advertisements are truth-bending in some way, period!), but it did not say ""LIVE concert""...For all we care, it was probably ""taped before a live audience."" Three-stars for low production value, otherwise, Celine is great as she was."
1,A danger to birds and windows,"I was given this as a house warming gift, and it was cute and charming and we did enjoy watching birds coming to feed right outside the window. We had to remove it within a month because:- Birds hovering around it kept flying into the glass and injuring themselves.- Squirrels kept jumping into the glass at high speed to raid it.- Bird body waste kept accumulating on the window.It seems like a good idea until after you pick up a dead bird or two from the ground below it, and you realize you really aren't doing much for birdkind with this feeder. The squirrels attacking it hit the window with enough noise to make everyone in the house jump, and it's just luck the glass didn't break and we didn't have a squirrel in the kitchen. Maybe if you have smarter birds and dumber squirrels it will work for you."
5,Great little feeder,"I took another reviewer's advice and made sure that the window and the suction cups were very clean. It's only been up for a few days outside my father's nursing home window, but has already withstood wind and heavy rain without falling."
5,Got cats? You need this.,"This feeder is great for bird lovers and folks with cats - it keeps our felines entertained all day long (or at least until the seed runs out). In fact I'm back on Amazon tonight looking for another one because it's been such a hit.I'm amazed by how well the suction cups hold. The feeder hasn't budged a bit since we put it up last fall, even when it's full of seed plus half a dozen or so squabbling sparrows. We have not had any trouble with birds running into the window when trying to get to the food.I will say that it took much, much longer than I expected for the birds to find this feeder. We are on the 3rd floor and there's not a lot of cover too close by - but still, it took about six months (and winter months at that!) before we saw our first bird at the feeder. Be patient and they'll discover you eventually, and then you'll be in the same boat we are - constantly running out of sunflower seed."
1,Bad Book,"I did not like this book. Not worth the price. No matter how many Nihon Goshin Aikido students write good reviews, it still stinks. I know someone will jump all over me for being honest but I don't want people to waste their hard earned cash. It dosent matter when this martial art was founded and by whom. The book is whats in question here. Nihon Goshin Aikido might be a fine system but this book is not a good example of it."
2,Book Bad - Author Worst,"I started reading this book on Nihon Goshin Aikido and thought to myself ""Hhhmm..another book on another form of Aikido"" Wow, like we really need this. There is nothing different or new in this book. Now, I realize that all the Nihon Goshin Aikido students are going to jump all over me for this, but its true, the book is bad. Then all of a sudden I realized who wrote the book! Its co-author, Walter Kopitov, is one of the worst martial artists I've ever met. He is a big ego-manaic. Now he writes a book! people, please don't waste your money on this book. And for all you students and friends of Kopitov, save your breath. We don't want to hear your opinon. Bottom line: Book stinks."
2,Fair Book,"I have studied Nihon Goshin Aikido. I enjoyed it for a while, but like most, I realized that I would have to study something ""more effective"" to be able to defend myself. I don't think it makes a difference if the authors of the book are great martial artists or not. I'm sure they ""think"" they are. Whenever anybody writes a book like this, it is a futile exercise in ego. Do we need this book? No. Do we have enough lame books like this, Yes. Its amazing how many offshoots of Aikido there are. And when you look closely, they are all the same."
4,Excellent book !,"The book has good information, is informative and very to the point. It reads easily and provides a very comprehensive selection of techniques for the student to view. I enjoyed it very much and will use it often.Sensei Bowe was responsible for the highest quality and most accurate NGA training that Sensei Kopitov's has ever received . When he came to Sensei Bowe's Guttenberg dojo over ten years ago, in many ways he began from scratch as Sensei Bowe had to diligently undo much of the instruction he received before. Sensei Kopitov trained exclusively for over a decade with Shihan Bowe.If you take issue with Sensei Kopitov style or form I suggest you ask Sensei Bowe himself. Plus it is childish, silly and looks like somebody else put you up to slam the book."
5,I love this type of book,"I collect all types of martial arts books. The ones I like best are the how to books, that show the techniques. I consider myself a technique collector. This book is nothing but techniques! Non of that boring discussion about the spirit or overly long history lesson. It gets right to the nitty gritty. I wish all the photos were great but some are a little dark. I had been to one of his seminars in NJ and I felt his techniques personally and they were very powerful. He was a very meticulous in his explanations and he made sure all the students got personal instruction. He knows Aiki.I have also went to Mr. MacEwen's seminar and found that he was very fast but couldn't teach well and had a tendency to talk about himself more then teach. I got tired about hearing how much he travels and then he would sit down and BS with others and not pay attention to the paying students. I can see why Mr. Kopitov wouldn't want to be associated with him."
4,Worthy of its subject,"This slender book, with its dark, attractivecover and glossy, gorgeous pages, is a work oftribute to Miss Hepburn which skillfully evokes her tremendous appeal. The text is slight but smoothly readable, and filled with amusing and often touching recollections from directors,actors, and other friends of the late movielegend. The real attraction of the book is of course the pictures, in particular the stunning black-and-white gatefold taken from a sessionwith Richard Avedon."
4,Where are the birds?,"The feeder is very high quality, nicely constructed. The holes have allowed some rain in, but it has been rainy the last few days. However, I have yet to see one bird at the feeder even with fresh niger seed. I am hoping they are just in a migratory pattern and will show up soon."
2,Attracts Goldfinches...and unwanted Squirrel attention,"The birds took to this feeder quickly, but I was concerned about the thin walled plastic that was used. I had the feeder a little over a year when the squirrel started investigating this feeder.They started by enlarging the slot hole and eventually made it a large gash that the thistle seed would pour out of.One thing to note is the diameter of the feed tube. The thistle feeder diameter is only about 3"". I have another Droll feeder that hangs alongside this this thistle feeder (for larger bird with sunflower seeds), and the due to it's much larger diameter (~6""), the squirrels have been unable to chomp on it (thusfar).So now I'm looking for a new feeder, and probably one with a larger diameter."
5,Can't lose Feeder,"Anyone looking for a thistle feeder that they want to last should look no further. You will have trouble finding a better product. Worth the price, I have 4 Droll Yankee feeders in my yard and they are draped with birds every day. I'll add that they are easy to take apart and clean and are built like tanks. Beware of inexpensive feeders, you just end up replacing them."
5,thistle feeder,This feeder is top notch. It is made to last. The price for the feeder is very reasonable considering the quality of workmanship.I will probably buy another next fall.
2,American Art,"The History of American as seen throught the art it produced. A long and colorful history, showing that nothing exists in a vacumn. Art both influences and is influenced by events and ideas that surround it."
3,Why did he write this book?,"The first and last chapters of this book make me wonder why the author actually decided to cover the subject. They show an increadible bias against the early colonists, Christianity, and western society in general. It makes me wonder why he wished to cover the topic of American Art History in the first place if he hates it so much. I also found his interpretations inaccurate on several occasions as he used scientific knowledge that would not have been known at the time the artwork was made.He does, however have a very good selection of rare artwork and shows the mixing of diferent styles very well."
3,sound and track listing,The songs are great. The CD is not remastered. The sound quality is poor. Asmahan's voice on old records is much better than on CDs. The track listing is not accurate. Sahirto toul el leil is not there.
4,Excellent resource for all Christians,Honestly I cannot say enough good things about the PC Study Bible product in general. As a Christian layman this program has aided me in my studies as well as online discussions. Fairly easy to use. Some things about it could be more user-friendly but once you've figured them out it become routine.
4,Very good resource,"This book has some examples that will really make you think about static sparks! The book is packed with good, practical information about sources and causes of static discharge. I recommend it for anyone in industrial processing."
3,"adequate, but not ideal","The picture does not match the stand - mine is black, and has only one bolt at each anchor point. There were no instructions in the box, but it wasn't hard to figure out. You have to do the bolts up _really_ tight for it to be rigid (I used two wrenches). However, it does hold my saw quite well. I would have preferred rubber feet, as the plastic ones don't offer much friction -- when ripping a board the whole stand sometimes slides across the floor. It's also quite expensive for what it is, especially when you compare to the price of the saw itself."
3,SCORPIONS STING HAS LITTLE BITE,"Eves latest effort ""Scorpion"" is okay, but not as good as her first effort.The album is completely overproduced, with Eves vocals lost in the translation.Its a fair to good album, but something that won't last on my player very long.Eve has a future, but she needs a better manager, producer and more control of her artistic endeavors.I feel in this CD she lost all that. The standout songs here are ""Whos That Girl"", ""Cowboy"" and the duet with the classic voice of Teena Marie ""Life Is So Blind""....that is why I give this CD 3 instead of 2 stars with the guest appearance of Ms. Marie the CD goes up one level.But the problem on this album that almost every song features a guest appearance with Mo'nique, DMX, Marley, Marie, etc.Eve or her label shouldn't have to rely on guest appearances, Eve could pull out on her own if given the chance."
4,cd's pretty good,this cd is pretty good because it has good beats and i think she has grown up as an artist because this cd's tracks are really good. I don't knwo how 2 describe it. U should cop this album no matter who u are.
4,The First Lady does it again!!!!!,"Eve does it again with this great album. The Ruff Ryders Fist Lady has to be the best female rapper in history. She hits the charts with this one. It's got good beats but some of it is still alittle the same. Thats why I only gave it four stars. She is improving in the rap game. If you are pondering about getting this CD then I should tell you to get it. It's worth your money. Eve, keep up the good work!!!!!!!"
3,Deadly Scorpion,"Ruff Ryders first lady is back and better than before. Gone the short blond locks and in its place a hot red perhaps keeping in theme with the album title Scorpion. Who's that girl is already blowing up the radio stations as well as the video on MTV and BET. though her songs can be a tad on the lengthy side i enjoyed this better that the first cd. Eve does have a range of songs i just hope more are played on the radio. Eve was really only know for a couple of songs like ""Love is blind"" and ""I got a man"" good beats till you here it for the 9th time in a hour, so lets hope they don't make the same choice with the ""Scorpion"" cd and a certain hot single because, we already know Who Eve is..."
2,Same old Same,"when I found out that Eve was doing a track with Lady T.Teena Marie I got Sparked but aside from ""Life is so hard"" this is the same old same form Eve.She has Her own Style I will Give Her that but the Material,the Music&the Guests aside from Teena Marie bring nothing to the Musical Table or Lyrical table.besides in the big picture from listening to Her I feel Rap is Like a Hobby She is Looking at getting into other forms of Entertainment."
1,This Scorpion has no sting!,Okay first i want to say that I WAS a huge Eve fan when she first released ruff ryders first lady. Now I am SO not a fan! I mean how do you go from her first Cd production and lyrics to Scorpion! I mean this album was really disappointing to me. Eve said she wrote her own rhymes on her first CD but I'm starting to have doubts because there is no way she could have wrote something so tight and then come back with Scorpion. There a few tracks and i do mean A FEW but I got rid of the CD the day after I purchased it and i can't remember them so...take the advice of a true music head and don't purchase this garbage!
3,Getting Better,"This was an album that i couldnt really get into from the start, but the more i listen to it the better it gets. (i have only given it 3 stars but it may improve later) My favourite tracks on the album that i usualy stick on repeat are, Let Me Blow Your Mind (featuring Gwen Stefani from No Doubt who i a m a huge fan of, so this track is my favourite), Whos That Girl, Scream Double R, Got What You Neede, and Thats What it is. This album is one that needs some time so dont cast it aside after one listen, persevere and you will find its a worth while cd"
3,Straight,"I love Eve but that ""BROKEN SILENCE IS A CLASSIC"" by FOXY BROWN. PICK IT UP ON JULY 17th. ONE."
2,wildly inconsistent,"i couldn't even make it through the whole cd. the singles were supa-hot, but the rest of the CD is a disappointment. it's unfortunate. eve has a lot of talent and potential, but this album mixes too many styles and doesn't do it well. the result is an incredibly inconsistent, amazingly disappointing follow-up album. please let #3 be better."
2,take out swizz and get 4 stars,"Swizz Beats used to be the hottest producer in the hiphop scene. He made hit after hit. Then one day he ran out of creative juices. Yet he still makes music. Eves album w/o swizz would be 4 stars. The two bangers produced by dr. dre make you realize how good eve could be. The lead single produced by Teflon is highly listenable as well. But when we add swizz subpar production added in, the album begins to drag. None of swizz's contributions are noteworthy except thug in the sreet. That song is alright, but the rest of his beats are basically recycled old beats. Dont get me wrong, eve is probably the most talented female emcee out there, she just needs to work more with dre and less with swizz. Eves lyrics even seem to be energized on the dre tracks. Swizz seems to = a ""who cares"" attitude."
4,FEEL THE STING!,"I am not a expert on the genre of rap music, just a casual fan. But I know an exceptional talent when i hear one and Eve lays it down on her second album, ""Scorpion"". Filled with jamming beats and unusually clever and smart lyrics, i feel this is one of the few rap albums to actually take seriously. It seems to cross some kind of barrier to become an album that may still be relevant in five years. From the opening track, ""Cowboy"" to the duet with Teena Marie(""Life Is So Hard""), Eve has a consistency in the production and strength on the tracks. The first two singles ""Who's That Girl"" and ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind"" with Gwen Stefani borderline on pop brilliance. Other standouts include ""That's What It Is"" and ""You Had Me, You Lost Me"". For this casual rap fan's money, this album is worth it."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I bought this CD because I had heard ""let me blow ya mind"" & ""Who's that girl?"" and loved them both. But then it turned out, Eve could mix everything-from being risque to singing gospel! This rap-hip-hop woman deserves to stay in the spotlight for a long time. One of the few today that have much talent, and not relying fully on her beauty to sell her album. It's one I will probably still be listening to frequently this time next year :) The best songs are:Let me blow ya mindWho's that girl?you had me, you lost meScream double rLife is so hardBe meNo,no,noGot what you needSome of them are fillers, like ""thug in the street""-she hardly sings @ all! ""cowboy"" is pretty good, 2.if you like rap or hip-hop, this is the CD of the year for you!!!"
4,Great DVD,"This is a great DVD. Jeff Loomis is an amazing musician. In this DVD he breaks down several solo's and some killer riffs as well. He plays them at full speed then slows it all down for us to understand exactly what is going on.I am hoping you already know how to play because there is some advanced technical picking and fingering going on from time to time.From his killer melodic sense to his brutal diminished attacks, anyone can learn something new here. Take little bits and pieces of what Jeff is teaching and add it to your own playing.I gave this DVD a 4 star rating because I was really hoping he would have broke down at least one song from start to finish....so we could have a better understanding of how he builds a song but....he does get us pretty close.If you are looking to improve your playing and want to add something new to your arsenal, buy this DVD....I did!"
3,good,"The topics are well developed, but I am disappointed that the backing tracks issues Jeff are just phrases, not the backing tracks of complete songs."
4,JILL SCOTT DOES IT AGAIN,I LOVE JILL'S 1ST CD I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST CD'S EVER...I SLEPT ON THIS CD FOR FEAR OF THE SOPHOMORE JINX... I WAS WRONG...THIS CD IS MORE JAZZY THEN THE FIRST AND HER MELODIES ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SIMPLE...YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH JILL SCOTT SHE HAS AN AMAZING VOICE AND SHE IS SO POETIC... KEEP THE GOOD MUZIK COMING JILL....
2,Hopefully Vol. 3 will be better.,I bought Volume 2 on the strength of Volume 1 which was an excellent album. This one is painfully boring. I have not listened to the entire tracklisting yet and I bought it the weekend it was released. Maybe it will grow on me but I can't seem to get through the entire cd in one sitting.
2,Love Jill...but Not feeling this CD...Just Plane Boring,"I really love Jill, but I am so disappointed in this CD. It does not pull me in, sorry yall. I tried to listen to this CD several times over and over again, but I couldn't. I will continue to support, but overall this CD could\should of been better."
3,What Happened Jill????,"I am a huge fan of Jill's...except when it comes to this CD. I don't know what happened, but I'm really not feeling it. Of course some of the beats are cool and there are the inevitable groovy cuts like ""Whatever,"" ""Cross my Mind,"" ""Not Like Crazy,"" and ""Family Reunion,"" but the true standout of this group is ""Golden."" I hate to say it, but I was severely disappointed (especially since I opted to purchase this CD instead of burning it)! :-("
3,Pretty Good Set,Jill scott is like a Modern Day Anita Baker if you will.operating out of the same structure that Anita did but with a Hip-Hop vibe to go along with the various Stylings. Jill is a good writer&a Decent Vocalist. some things work for me some don't.I still feel that something is missing from her work on a whole.but she is a Very Talented Artist.she sets a decent mood&makes you reflect.i like some the Arrangements&some of the runs here.
1,What Happened to Jill?,"I took this CD back. I didn't like the music---it was rough compared to Volume I. It had some of the same rhythms as Volume I, but did not flow. It was choppy and with nothing new. What happened to Jill?"
3,She is Beautifully Human,"I can appreciate the fact that part of being 'Beautifully Human' is imperfection. I think Ms. Scott appreciates and embraces that as well. I don't think she was attempting to 'match' or 'outdo' volume one, I just think she is simply communicating the fact that she is a human who endures the same experiences all of us do (love, pain, hope, success, failure, etc). Overall it's a decent album but I have to remind myself that she was in a different place spiritually and mentally when she recorded these songs. Most of us don't know the pressure that artists who have a very succesfully debut endure to perform at the level of expectation they create. So no, it's not Volume 1 but it's not garbage either."
2,Music or a Menu?,"I like Jill Scott, but I wish that she would stop singing her grocery list!! I will buy one more album and if it's about food that's it. The sensuality of eating and love has been taken too it's limits. I'm ready to experience Jill Scott the passionate poet and songstress."
1,Unsuccessful Self-Imitation.,"Volume one and 826+ - she did it big time and made me a huge fan of hers.. but it seems shes trying to recreate the past but..despite my effort to love this new album it really s*>cks.All you fans out there praise everything she does... but be honest with yourselves.. every song sounds the same, and like every other artist out there. I strongly recommend jill's fans to not approach this one so you can be left with the sweet taste of the past.hearing the love shmaltz over and over again makes you sick, and it seems as if her label know this album is lame so they put all the PR on ""Golden"" which is the only loveable-reminds-the-past track.Zack."
2,Sophomore Slump,"As a HUGE fan of Jill's first effort, this offering was a big disappointment.Everyone needs a little uplifting in their lives but ever so slowly, literally, preachy, and ""sap-happily"" done? It got old fast.Gone is the sass and variation of her masterful debut. In it's place is a woman so firmly secure and sure, her music has become as static, as she is. And the repetition of certain lyrics and notes is mind-numbing.I'm glad she's happily in love (with her man and G-O-D). I only wish she could remember all those other complex emotions with her music and put Jazzy Jeff on to backing her voice with more interesting tracks, as well.And, while I'm at it...How many times can the word ""Golden"" be repeated in a song?Given that hearing only the first 47 utterances, in the song of the same title, tends to induce vomiting and spontaneous ear combustion, the world may never know..."
2,It's alright,"Although i love Jill Scott, I didn't care too much for this album. I just like a few cuts from this album and that's including ""Golden"". I think that her first album was off the hook. Every track on there was unbelievable. But this one, i don't think is worth buying."
4,Took me a while to get into it...,"Each of Jill's albums since ""Who Is Jill Scott"" have been quite a departure from it, and that one is still my favourite. ""Beautifully Human"" is slower but does grow on you.Jill has surprised me with her follow up albums and so I think I may need to apply my old rule to her from now on ""Wait for more than one release BEFORE deciding on whether to buy the whole album"". I've thrown that rule out the window for artists like Angie Stone. Whatever she releases I can buy without hearing a single track. Haven't been disappointed yet."
3,"Who is Jill Scott, Again?","This is an okay cd, of course I was hopeing for something more. I was looking forward to a cd that makes you pop it in the player all the time (like I still do with the first one) but then again this is not the first one it is the second one. It's a nice cd, I listen to it every now and then."
3,"Very nice, yet...","Let me start off by saying that I have always loved and admired Ms. Jill Scott for her artistry and lovely persona. Words and Sounds Vol. 1 is truly a favorite album of mine and will remain so for years to come. I am sorry to say, however, that Words and Sounds Vol. 2 is lacklustre and a bit boring. I was left asking where is that energy, that ""uumph""? I was very disappointed. This album is very nice to go to sleep or relax to, yet it does not come anywhere near Jill's first record. On the contrary, the extra track, entitled ""I Am Here"" is so amazing that I truly don't mind the shortcomings of all the other songs."
2,Annoying Human-but I still love her,"For the record, I really love her and its great that she is a ""real"" artist and not a producer's creation. However, this CD was NOT on her better efforts. What made me crazy was all the songs talked about her man, their love and the hot sex they have.I tried 3 times to listen to the disc and I couldn't take it. Clearly, she needs to have a conversation with Angie Stone about how not to annoy her fans. To be fair, I love ""Golden"", Cross my Mind and Whatever....very well executed and enjoyable. Hopefully next time she will find something else to make music about. I still love her and will remain a fan."
5,No Love Lost Here,"I never expected or wanted her to duplicate the last album. You have to growth some time. Even though her 1st album was (...u feel in the blank, check out my review), this album was very well made. The cohesiveness was there that most album do not have nowadays and you can tell she is happy with this album in her voice. Too bad monotone singers aka non-diva broads do not take notes."
5,Wonderful CD,"This is a great CD and you'll truly enjoy it if you buy it. If you've got Jill Scott, Van Hunt,"
5,Food for the soul,"Jill,You have done it again. The first cd was wonderful and this one is even better. My personal favorite is ""The Fact Is I Need You.""This cd is a masterpiece. You have such control of your voice. Thank you for coming back to show the world what real music is supposed to sound like."
5,beautifully right!!!!,"excellent, the bomb, tight, smooth, relaxing, and ""not"" i repeat ""not"" skippable. get it......when u got it......wear it out like u did the first album. remember that?"
4,For new Jill Scott converts,"I would just like to say that I was never a big fan of Jill or jazzzy like tunes for that matter, but au contraire to what Simone Lauderdale from Maryland said about this album NOT winning over new people, I think she's wrong! I love it man! I am now looking forward to Jill in concert! I am a new jazz or whatever this music is fan! Tracks 4 I need you, 07 - Cross my mind, 09 - Family reunion, 7 - Bedda at home and 11 Whatever stand out for me. Want smooth music to chill out to, wind down with a glass of wine (red or white your choice), choose Miss Jill Scott :-)"
3,OKAY CD!.....,"I'm not really a Jill Scott fan since after her first CD. I feel that with many of her songs since her fame she has not had that 'GUSTO' if you will... or at the least her passion has not been coming across through her music as expected. The song 'WHATEVER' even as kind of 'kooky' but, has a kind of sincerity, is a song Jill sounds really good on (I have not heard her sing like that in a while) the band always sounds great. I also like 1 or 2 other songs but I actually bought the CD for the song 'WHATEVER.'STILL LOOKING FOR THE ""LIKE OR LOVE"" EVERY SONG ON THE CD....CD!!!!!!Thanks."
3,a little let-down,"her first album really raised the bar, a bar she herself couldn't leap, climb, or crawl over with her next. there's a few good songs on this one yet the pace as a whole is slumpy and slower...not as upbeat and uplifting."
3,THE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE.................,"VOLUME 2 OPENS UP WITH THE JAZZY, HYPNOTIC CUT ""I'M NOT AFRAID"" AND THEN RIGHT ONTO THE UPLIFTING SMASH ""GOLDEN""-A WONDERFUL SLICE OF LIFE DESCRIBING SELF LOVE & LIBERTY. ""SPRING SUMMER FEELING"" IS BEAUTIFUL, JILL IS CERTAINLY IN LOVE, THIS TRACK SAYS JUST THAT. ""TALK TO ME"" STARTS OFF SOULFUL THEN TRANSITIONS INTO A JAZZY, BIG BAND EXTRAVAGANZA. ""BEDDA AT HOME"" COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OFF OF THE CD, JILL SINGS ON AN OCTAVE THAT'S JUST TOO HIGH AND CAN LEAD TO IRRITATION. ""WHATEVER"" AND ""NOT LIKE CRAZY"" ARE AWESOME AND ""RASOOL"" IS A SAD ,BUT MOVING TRACK ABOUT THE TITLE CHARACTER. ""MY PETITION"" IS VERY NICE. ""FAMILY REUNION"" AND ""I KEEP"" DO NOTHING FOR ME, BUT OVERALL, THIS IS A DECENT EFFORT...NOT BETTER THAN VOLUME 1..BUT, DECENT NONETHELESS."
2,Hum Drum...,"I really like Jill Scott, but the sophmore piece was not at all to me a great work coming from her. I bought this cd for a road trip, and I coulnd't stand it. Every song sounded like the one before it. There was no true median in her approach. Im sure she can do much better. But as a listener and fan, I was very much disappointed."
3,A little surprised....,"First the good....I absolutely love Jill Scott. Her words & lyrics are beautiful. Her voice makes you warm inside and her smile, spirit and love of her first album are what made me buy this album. I was so excited to put it in the cd player but upon the first listen I was sort of disappointed that not one song stood out as ""Great"". So upon a few more listens this album is just ""ok"". Nothing great or spectacular like her first. There are a few nice songs (4,5,6,13,15,16) but nothing to put on repeat. There are alot of soft songs that sound like Minnie Riperton. Jill's voice is still one of the best around and of course I'll buy her next album cause I'll always be a fan."
5,Beautiful Words and Sounds!!,"While buying this CD, I had no doubt that I was getting one of the best albums of this year. Sure enough, Jill Scott's ""Beautifully Human"" is consistently engaging. The lyrics are intelligent and thought provoking, her voice is beautiful, and the music is wonderfully soulful and down-to-earth. It's just real. It's amazing how she tells stories and explains emotions on many different levels through her music. I haven't heard a soul album this smooth in a minute and it hasn't left my CD player yet. Make it a point to pick up ""Beautifully Human""... good music like this doesn't come by often!!"
5,the most beautiful and musical r&b record of the decade,"This album is full of r&b jams with live instruments especially pianos that beautifully mesh well with jill scotts vocals of strong and energetic melodies speaking of love, life and spirituality. This one was definitely worth my money and Jill gives hope to r&b music fans that this genre is still alive and going strong despite what we are bombarded with on BET when it comes to r&b. This album flows even better than the first one too and is much more musical. Get it today"
5,All Hail Queen Jill,"I L-O-V-E this album & I've only had it for 4 days. It was well worth the wait. Jill has yet again pumped some life into the lackluster R&B genere. If you have the other Jill albums, this one is a MUST to continue your collection as this will certainly be future collector's item. She continues to get better with each album and never seems to disappointment in whatever she does. I'm particularly feeling I'm Not Afraid (Track 2), Golden (Track 3), Cross My Mind (Track 6), & Bedda At Home (Track 7). I love Family Reunion (Track 9) as well. If you don't have this get it now BEFORE the Grammy announcements as it will be hard to get then."
5,THIS IS A GOLDEN SOPHOMORE RELEASE!!!,"I bought this album yesterday.There arent many times that I have heard music that changes my mood,my outlook my spirit.This album makes me feel differently about myself and those around me.The songs all have such deep meaning.I knew this was gonna be a good cd.I had no idea it would be this good.It is a strong extension of the first cd.So far my favorites are:1.Golden2.The Fact Is(I need you)3.Cross My Mind4.Cant Explain5.Talk to meI also like the messages in the songs Rasool and My Petition.Jazzy Smooth Mellow....Great !!"
4,"Album Is Dope!! If you like Jill, you will love dead prez also so check that out to!!,","Like I said this is that real R&B right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!! May, 13 2006!! Straight From Chappelle's ""Block Party"" Dead Prez With Ras Kass, DJ Revolution Of Wake Up Show, KDAYS Icy Ice & More TBA.... 350 Pine Ave., The Vault 350...Long Beach, CA 90801....An Extremely Limited Amount Of Pre-Sale Tickets Available Now For On-Line Purchase @ www.thaformula.com & @ Your Local Record Shops"
5,Beautifully Classic,"We all knew it would happen. Some nu-soul voice would carry out from the heavy glaze of glossy r&b. You might not have thought Jill Scott would be that woman, but you know as well as I do that she is. It is in fact so obvious that Jill Scott is the reigning woman of soul. One part Aretha, a dash of sensual whisper that Minnie Ripperton possessed, and the confidence of Chaka worn proudly by Jill's soul. Beautifully Human is just what it is called- human. Full of insightful words from this black goddess, but never self-absorbed, lush harmonies and shimmering vocals laced with passionate verse after passionate verse, Scott's second album is pure gold. From the mid-tempo, brazenly confident 'Golden', to the sexy, spoken word groove of 'Cross my Mind', Jill Scott's long awaited second album will have you feeling a state of euphoria- definitely one of the best albums of 2004."
4,She's back!,"It's still Jill but NOT in your face Jill. NOT ""Who is Jill Scott"".She's deeper in a mellow way. People aren't used to change. You definitely ain't gonna say, ""...oh, that typical Jill."" She's trying to make her listeners appreciate the real JILL. This is ""Buttermilk"" Jill (from North Star bar in North Philly that hosted poetry slams). You may not get it the first time, or the second but she'll have ya thinking."
4,Great Album,"I never liked Jill Scott's last album, but this is so much better. She truly redefines neo-soul. She tackles a great deal of topics and the sound is so diverse, there's soul in there, there's jazz, and almost anything good I can think of. I would usually give a few standout tracks, but this album is great to listen to all way from beginning to end."
5,Welcome Back!!,"Initially I wasn't too excited about this album because I wasn't a huge fan of the song ""Golden"", however, I bought the CD because of my appreciation for Jill Scott. I am so glad that I bought this CD because it is worth every dollar that I spent. On this album, Jill brings a softer side that shows love, affection and appreciation for the African-American family (something that most of the urban music today lacks). My favorite tracks are 4,5, and 12. For anyone looking for a change of pace and something new to listen to, this CD is definitely one to add to the collection."
3,Some good stuff,There are a couple really good songs on this album. Some of the other songs the lyrics I couldn't appreciate (talking about food).
5,Beautifully Human,"Jill's second studio album and we get another album of sumptuous vocals and soulful grooves. Not only has Jill Scott one of the most soulful voices i've heard in years but she has integrity and spirit. Her studio work is excellent and Jill Scott live is magical and well worth a try if you like this. This CD is worth it for 'Golden' alone, which is an upbeat song, and 'Rasool' which has some amazing lyrics that I found very moving. Buy this album and enjoy the poetry of her lyrics and feel the soul in her vocals. Amazing artist!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Musical Evenings,I did not enjoy this as much as Vol I. This contained more instrumets which I had not envisioned as being part of the book.
5,second good as the first,Once more...It is dead-on excellent. Perfectly in tune with the entire series and spirit of Patrick's work. A simply joy to listen to time after time. You grasp the character of the age in crisply performed versions of various collection.Good good stuff. Come on Killick you might just learn to like it.
5,Worth every penny !!,"A fantastic course by a terrific nutritionist. Weil's guide to optimum health is simple, thorough, and comprehensive.It elucidates the process of natural health and makes a great guide for every person that's interested in good nutrition, and wellness. Weil is objective, honest, and inspiring !!!"
3,"A clear picture, but hardly the most riveting read","I enjoyed this book. It gave a real inside look at CIA operations. The book has a real integrity to it. Detail is limited probably for secrecy reasons and some pictures in order to better demonstrate the disguises would have been excellent. As such, the reader has to imagine what the writer actually does.In is a good inside look at them at the banal stress of being an intelligence agent where doing extremely simple things under extremely stressful situations. It also gives a very clear indication of just how extensive the resources for forgeries and ""legends"" was during the Cold War.The writing is merely standard. There is little character development with the exception of the writer. As such, it is not an extremely good read, but it is worthwhile nonetheless."
4,Informative,"So interesting to ready about the life of a CIA agent. Especially since the movie ""Argo"" came out. It was Mendez who was played by Ben Affleck and who was responsible for getting the 6 hostages out of Iran.Without compromising security in his agency, Mendez was able to bring you into the CIA and see the inner workings that occurred during the cold war and beyond. A fascinating book about a fascinating man."
2,The Master of Disguse,"This is not a page turner of a book. Even though I admire Mr Mendez for his difficult work as a CIA operative, the book did not keep my interest."
4,Provides a frank and interesting story of what it was like to be a spy during the cold war,"The book provides a frank discussion of his life as a CIA officer. The book describes his time in Washington, Southeast Asia as well as Russia. Provides interesting detail about certain missions and how they were accomplished. No nonsense description of events and what works and what doesn't in espionage and how things have changed since he joined."
3,argo was better,"This is not without moments, but let's face it--he's a Company man. I haven't yet checked out his art & painting."
3,Interesting book about the workings of the CIA,"I found this book slow reading with many self Mrndez's self refrences. It provided some insights to the inner working of the CIA as well as some questional practices and in my opinion some stupid moves.It is not a great book, nothing like Vince Flynn or Brad ThorJ. Lapides"
5,Kindle Book - Master of Desguise,I enjoyed the book very much. I really like true stories rather than fiction. It was very informative and factual.
4,Interesting,I haven't finished this book yet. It is a bit technical so far. I will finish is though. The topic is intriguing.
3,Easy to put down--with update,"If you are extremely interested in covert operations, specifically disguise, then this may be your book. Seems to build to a crescendo with detail about technique then fizzles as it relates to the mission and its consequences.Update: After seeing the film ""Argo"" I'm glad I read this book. See Chapter 9 to appreciate what 'based on the true story' really means. Hint: key word is 'based'."
4,Antonio's Altering Art,"Antonio Mendez specialized in altering - He altered papers, people and politics. His story as The master of Disguise shows us the talents of an interesting man who used his art for his country. After seeing the movie, Argo, I was anxious to read more of Antonio's exploits and this book didn't disappoint. For those of us who wonder how one enters the ""spy"" profession, Mr. Mendez shows one way - just a guy doing a good job of drawing from a major company. His talents made him ideal for creating identities and cover for people caught in dangerous situations. He progressed to other means of helping them escape from these things by means of disguise and deception. This man is obviously very bright (his vocabulary and writing style demonstrate that). For those of us who like clear descriptions, he goes into very long sentences (some over 50 words per sentence), which were a little disconcerting to me. Except for this little thing, this is an excellent book."
1,"Come On, Tony","Come on Tony! How many times can you wave your medal around and make money on books that compromise tradecraft? I don't care whether or not Langley approved your text or whether or not the Russians already know about CIA disguise methods. If you hadn't noticed, they are not our number one problem any more-- its the cut throats (literally) of the terrorist world who would gain by your revelations, and who would surely relish the chance to unmask one of our officers. ""Secrecy is the lifeblood of intelligence."" So you say. A true clandestine warrior keeps his mouth shut, bud."
3,Book on CIA Operative,"Somewhat interesting but too muddied by insignificant details on passports, I.D.'s and documents rather than episodes of spy craft and stealth."
3,Hard read,"The story I thought was just ok, it was a hard , analytically complex story and was rather boring to be honest. I could only read about 10 pages at a time, then wanted to take a nap !!"
3,Master of Disguise,"Not enough dialog, more just narrative of the action. Couldn't keep my interest going. I will struggle through it though."
2,Too much detail for me.,Not enough action. It is more of a history of the writer's life than stories of his exploits. Did not finish it.
5,Wow! Very impressed with Mr Mendez' story.,"Amazing where we find such people! He has shown himself to have been not only a credit to our country, but certainly a demonstrated asset."
5,A Heart-Thumping Read,"Mr. Mendez has shared with his readers a very real sense of what it was to be inside the CIA, and then inside some of their most exciting (and up to this point) secret operations. It is interesting that the CIA has allowed these stories to be told now, but in fact, after reading them, it is apparent that the intelligence equities are not affected. In each case the or foreign source has been safely rescued and resettled or the case has been finalized, once with the ultimate sacrifice on the part of the asset. I was thoroughly caught up in these tales of rescue and escapes from danger. It is amazing that these true stories are even more exciting than the Clancey books. His first book is a definite must read and will be on my Christmas gift list for several of my friends."
4,Spymaster,"The ambitious Mendez rose from his roots in a Nevada mining camp to become one of the top 50 agents in the CIA's first 50 years. His stories, based on his real-life adventures, crackle more than than many spy novels and movies. The CIA authorized Mendez to write this book, which casts the Company in a favorable light as the rescuer of double agents on the run and Americans caught in a revolution. With deft descriptions, Mendez portrays cities and operations in the Far East, the Middle East and Communist Moscow. Relying on Hollywood techniques, Mendez became the master of disguise who could make a Soviet agent unrecognizable to a KGB associate. The writing is straightforward and fast-paced."
2,EXCELLENT IDEA BADLY EXECUTED,"Although this book does shed light on a few details of tradecraft and mission, it is poorly written and has nil factor in entertainment value (except chapters 8 and 9 about work in Moscow and Teheran). I read ""Master of Disguise"" while also rereading Pete Early's ""Confessions of a Spy"" and I couldn't help but to think how wonderful ""Master"" could have been with the level of scholarship and thought in Pete Early's book. On top of it all this book doesn't have an index and in a book this boring it would have been really nice to have one."
2,Not enough meat here,"Unfortunately, because of the author's position as a forger and disguise-master, he didn't get the plum assignments. No tales of break-ins or derring-do here, but rather hours spent behind a magnifying glass creating documents. The most exciting cases here involve exfiltrating spies and others from behind unfriendly territory. This usuallly involves making a mask for them and walking through an airport. In fact, there's about 3 tales of making masks and walking through airports ... and the author can't tell you the details of the masking technique, because it's secret.I can't help but think that any CIA spook who did see REAL adventure couldn't tell about it anyway because it would be classified. So this is the best we'll get. I'll stick with John LeCarre."
2,Boring.,"Slow, boring reading. I kept waiting for it to get exciting but it never did!! There is very little real 'meat' unless you are interested in becoming a hollywood makeup artist!"
5,Amazing what goes on without our knowledge,"These people are a very devoted group, who actually give of their selves to protect us from our enemies. They are hard working, long hours and almost all the time not recognized for their devoted service to our country. I was glad for a peek into their lives. It makes me wonder if I have ever met any of these interesting people."
5,A good read,"An engrossing tale of a CIA operative's work during the Cold War. Not being in the CIA, I can't tell how accurate it is, but it's definitely a fast-paced and interesting book to read."
4,Interesting,"How I wish Mendez could have given us a lot more details, but it is still an interesting book and I'd read anything else he wrote."
4,Good read for those interested in CIA,"A very interesting account of some CIA ops during te cold war and beyond. Well written, it provides a nice background as to how he came into his career and some intriguing cases."
1,Stories poorly told,"Very dry to read. Feel the author just ""fill"" words to prolong the stories and accumulate enough pages to be counted as a book."
4,A Must Book To Read,The ability of the CIA and FBI to extricate a cooperating foreign agent requires the art of deception and this book truly reveals many of the techniques used. Exceptionally interesting.
3,Self serving,"this author did not go sufficiently into the agency to keep much interest; much more interest can be generated if the focus is on the agency rather than ""look at me and how great I was"""
3,The real thing,"This book doesn't have the intense excitement and gee-whiz of the traditional spy novel, but it has the unmistakable taste of reality. It describes a patriotic and intelligent, self-made American's career in the CIA, and how his part of the agency actually functioned during the Cold War. I'm a Nevadan and read it partly because the author spent an underprivileged boyhood in rural Nevada, and I was impressed that he was able to apply the lessons of a hardscrable youth to his career. If anybody doesn't already know this, the author is the central character of the excellent motion picture ""Argo,"" and the book describes the incident on which the movie is based. I'd have given it two more stars if the writing were snazzier, but I believe the author was more concerned with accuracy and clarity, which are greater virtues in a non-fiction book like this one."
5,Good read,"Bought the book after seeing the movie ""Argo"" which was based on an episode in Anthony Mendez life. He is a fascinating man, and helped explain why he was chosed to execute the plan to free Americans from Iran in 1979. I recommend it highly"
4,Operations Disguise,Great insight by the author that provides a first hand account of the CIA and the many covert operations over the years. I recommend this book especially those that enjoy history.
4,MASTER OF DISGUISE,"The story of the CIA former worker explaining the exciting life that he lived touring around the continents., and spying in different cities."
3,Overly Detailed,"Read only about a third of the book before putting it down. Expecting more genralized ""cloak and dagger"" rather than intricate details about each and every [exfiltration] of opposing political/military voluntary escapees. Might pick up again and read remaining chapters if noting more interesting else to read."
3,not exactly my cup of tea,"This is not exactly my cup of tea but it is interesting. I'm reading it in-between other books. I think it is a bit technical, more realistic than being a story. It will take me a little longer to finish it but I'm sure I will eventually."
4,The Master of Disguise,"As a reader of spy novels, this book went behind the scenes and told a ""story"" from a true first-hand viewpoint. And as in any good spy novel, it held my interest and made my heart pound a little harder even though I did not understand everything! It also made for an intersting read from the human-interest side because the author had a family which made his story even more interesting, while in most spy novels, the main character usually doesn't have to deal with a wife and small children!"
3,It was informative,"This book was very informative, but it wasn't one of those books you can't put down. .it was worth reading but some parts were a little boring."
3,A light into spyland,"A informative reading of CIA inner workings. One agents deeds in his long service, with limiteddescription of actual operations. I read this book to gain insight on our spy factory. The bookwas a three star for content but lacking in its operations descriptions. I suppose secrecy limmitsmore details."
3,Ok but no thriller,"This is an OK read but certainly not a thriller. This is insight into someone's life that has mostly been lived doing things that land in classified or top secret files. The real deal but he does not go into too much detail as you might imagine. He probably would have been better off getting a decent writer to co-write it with him as he has done with several other books but regardless. If you are looking for a thriller then stay away, only a small bit of it is mildly interesting."
3,The Master of Disguise,"The subject was of interest to me. However, I felt the author missed the mark. I think he could have done a better job of making the book more interesting to people who have worked for the company and to a lay reader.who knows little about the intelligence business."
2,Snoozer,"I bought this book because I was told it was the foundation of Argo, and the book is always better. Well, apparently not always...cause this book is so dull, you end up reading the words without comprehending the data. I couldn't believe how little he mentions his family. The guy is in Asia, gone for weeks at a time, and never mentions the strain it puts on his family."
2,Pompus presentation of his part in things,"Did not like it. His use of the first person singluar pronoun was very annoying, as was the book in its entirety."
2,Cannot Recommend,"Sorry to say, I cannot recommend this book to anyone without some prior knowledge of the CIA, especially their acronyms for various types of ""ops."" As a novice, I sometimes became very confused."
3,Somewhat interesting-better than all the rehashed versions,"Mendez has rehashed his stories into several (half dozen?) books. This is the first and probably the best. It covers his whole career, of which the Argo episode is a small part.His writing is not as exciting as a good fiction writer's -- in fact kind of dry and downright clumsy in places. But his writing ability is serviceable for telling about his career during the heyday (and low days) of the CIA.So it's generally interesting but not a page-turner. Most of what you read about you already know, suspect, or have seen overdone is Hollywood pics -- being in the CIA is much more boring than being James Bond. Fair enough, the book reflects that in more ways than one.But all the rehash string of books by Mendez -- good grief, even Music companies don't make this many opuses out of one original work."
3,Nice insights into an unknown world for most of us.,"I found this book fascinating and also puzzling. Why would people WANT to work for the CIA? But, I'm glad they do. :)"
4,Fascinating Insight to a Secret World,"The further I got into this book, the more I felt like I was reading something by Clancy. It wasn't fiction, however, but a case where truth was more incredible than fiction. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in espionage or the Cold War."
4,Master of Disguise,"I am still reading this book. The life of a CIA agent is very interesting. It boggles my mind, the creativity of this group of people. The mental stress they are under is incomprehensible. They seem to live a fast paced life. I am enjoying the book very much."
4,Excellent,Excellent 1st hand account of a CIA officer. Well written and informative even though there was little detail in some events.
4,Real Life is better than Fiction,"I loved the movie Argo, but a few things didn't ring true. And sure enough, they weren't, as revealed in this book. But the book itself is fascinating. Amazing stories. Why read fictional spy tales when the real thing is available? A real ""can't put it down book."""
3,Master of disguise,Super interesting but slow at times! The tales of mendez's Cia days makes me wish that I was a spy!
4,Better than the movie,"Watching the movie ""Argo"" made me want to read more about Tony Mendez's experiences and I'm glad I did. The depth and breadth of the stories is amazing and the book is very easy to read and follow. If you're interested in the history of the CIA, this book should definitely be on your list."
4,Every Mufti Aint Mufti,"mendez' book throws a new light on the spy business which has not been exploited very well in other fiction about spycraft - the value of disguise. not since watching 'the killing fields' in which dith pran keeps mumbling 'ankertill brewer' over and over, has the drama of exfiltration been so dramatically portrayed. i found it very interesting to consider the possibilities now open in identity theft and spoofing given the role of hollywood effects artists in disguise anticipating the technology mendez describes (which must already be quite dated). if eddie murphy can do it, the cia could be having a field day. think about it, does anyone know what michael dorn (worf) really looks like?in these days as we chase down individuals in a global 'war' on terrorism, understanding this bag of tricks add a new and fascinating dimension to our thought process. this is a very worthwhile book to consume."
4,Very good book,"Interesting trip behind the headlines. I am proud we have people like Mr Mendez working for our nations security.very readable book, well written."
3,Master of Disguise,"Interesting insofar as the revelations about CIA ops, but too self-congratulatory. To me, the writing style was poor, but I persisted for the historical information, esp. about the successful extraction of the American citizens from Iran while Iran was still holding our Embassy personnel and the view of the CIA Presidental appointments to head the org."
3,It starts off good...,"The book starts off interestingly enough. It lives up to its expectations at first, giving the readers an interesting and suspenseful take of the life of a spy, but then it gets very redundant. Mendez seems to be talking about the same mission over and over but in different locations. Also, the CIA's censorship is not only apparent, it less interesting. And the ending is not satisfying at all. This book is great for history buffs but not for casual readers."
2,unimpressed!,"i found the book to be slow and did actually not mention anything that i considered to be revealing or exciting. it is one of those books that you keep reading in hopes for it to get better and it shows a slight improvement when you read the soviet union and iran chapters, but no secrets. i could have skipped the first part of the book and would have not missed anything. in general explains the use of disguises to accomplish secret missions but does not get into the important details. it fails to transmit the danger, feeling, and suspense of the situation. sorry, not worth it!"
3,"OK, very self-serving",A bit of a slow read. Interesting but not riveting. Would have preferred more factual writing and less self promotion.
4,Genman,I found this book to be very interesting. It gives a small insight into some of the inner worrkings of the CIA.
1,"BORING AS HELL, was too hyped up by readers","boring as hell, he needs to write his experience more as a novel describing events that he worked on overseas, instead he tries to tell parts of his life with the mistake of interjecting a comment or newsfeed of something that happened 10 or 12 years back and then returning to his original thought. If you want to become engrossed in a good story of life in the CIA, this is not the book instead he tries to give you a history lesson of CIA life with tidbits here and there in between telling his story. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, check this out at the library, I wish I could get a refund."
4,How did I get from there to here?,"I purchased this book with the thought that it would be a James Bond 007 type story, and upon reading the first few chapters, I realized that was a false impression. However, I enjoyed this book because of its real-life excitement and derring-do, and I love learning how things work. It is not usual at all to see inside the CIA and its workings, and this is exciting all by itself. This book is not dull and tedious for me; it shows how Agent Mendez had to start at the bottom in his job and work up to the exciting and dangerous work of exfiltration and all of its complicated details to afford exfiltration. I enjoyed this book and will be looking for more of the same genre, if and when it appears on Amazon."
5,Cold war revisit,How cool is it to hear about the cold war from a person who knows it firsthand. I loved this book and the context of the people doing clandestine work in that era. Well worth reading if you are a child of the sixties or seventies.
4,A first hand look inside the secretive CIA an interesting read.,"I enjoyed the look inside the secretive exploits of the CIA. Mr. Mendez's accounts within the company were exceptional. Fact based, entertaining, and suprisingly down to earth. A true artist at what he does. The deadly chess game of spies is always evolveing ensureing twists and turns with what appears to be no true winners. An interesting, entertaining, and enlightening read from the world that does not exist."
4,What some of our CIA does to protect America.,The further you get in this book the more you enjoy it. I read this before I saw ARGO because I wanted to have a better understanding of the man. It definitely gives you information about the agent.
1,I resent this book.,This book is so small... and useless. Its too useless to even give away. I resent it because I don't have the courage to throw it out. It was a gift. No one would buy it otherwise...unless they are taken by how small it is.
5,Palm Reading,I bought this book strictly out of curiosity and actually found it to be more interesting then I imagined it would be. Thank you.
3,Tiny book,"Cute book, would have bought the other larger sized edition if I had known how tiny this was since it's only a few dollars more. Smaller than a deck of cards, still a nice little gift for my teenaged daughter who is into palmistry and horoscopes and things of that nature. Cute drawings, they look like colored pencil drawings."
4,Tiny Book,"I can't lie, i do enjoy this book, given the information. But when I bought it i didn't think that miniature meant three inches tall. It is handy to have anywhere you want, can fit in a purse, pocket, any fitted area."
3,Interesting,"This mini book is interesting, but didn't tell me anything about palm reading I didn't already know. Is a good book just to place on your nightstand for ""looks""."
1,Palm Reading,This is a cute little book that gives only a very small overview on palm reading. It is quite smaller that I expected but I did enjoy reading it.
2,Book too small to entertain or educate.,"If you are looking for a book to learn a few parlor tricks about palm reading, there are other books out there that are better. This book is literally a miniature book, being only about 4 nches long and does not offer any substantive info on palm reading.. I don't recommend it."
3,"Nice book, but not in my tastes","This book is amazing if you want to learn how to impress girls. Not many guys are interested in palm and hand reading, but a lot of women are genuinely fascinated when you describe them by looking at the lines in their hands."
2,Palm sized book is too small to enjoy,"This book is too small to really be ""read"" and instead functions more as an interesting little knick knack.The size would have worked if the content was more pictoral or was at least presented visually in smaller ""bites"" of information, but instead you get chapters of dense text in a 3x3 size. Not too user friendly.That said, his would be great as part of the *wrapping* of a present... If for example you were giving a themed gift, this could be part of the bow decoration."
3,Dog Gone Interesting,"I did not expect the book to be for reading in your palm (palm reading). In other words, it is really smaller than the palm of my hand. It's not really as detailed as I would have liked, but I think I would like it better if my dog did not try to ingest it. Now it's even smaller, but the main contents are legible. ADVICE: Not recommended for puppy consumption."
4,Memorable and fun,This reminded me of the kung fu movies I used to watch on Saturday afternoon tv as a kid. I loved those movies then and I love them now. This flick left me satisfied and that is high praise in my book.
3,It was like watching the Weather Channel,"A pleasant grouping of tracks which reminds me of my hospital stay after my terrible auto accident several years ago. I'm much better now, but just listening to this CD brings the memories back."
5,Great gift for crafters,"Good book for crafters, a little complicated for children. But the patterns and illustrations are beautiful."
4,"Beautiful work, complicated instructions","The cards in Ms. Nakazawa's book are beautiful, and although they look simple the easiest one will take hours to complete.I found the instructions a bit hard to follow -- what is Duma paper? Bristol paper? They're required for almost every project. I am very curious if any typical crafter has been able to make her cards look as nice as those in the picture."
4,deedee,Just the book if you are into making your own greeting cards. This one is easy and you get a lot of new ideas and patterns
4,Pop-Up Best Greeting Cards,"Instructions are a little complicated, but the book is interesting. Projects are worth a try."
5,Shoe Review,"If you wear a certain size, get the next size up. this shoe tends to be somewhat small. I got a nine, because thats my size, but i had to re-order and get a ten. and returns/refunds are a hassle. The are supprisingly comfortable. I bought them for my Eigth grade graduation, and they were comfortable the whole time, they didnt make my feet sore,but they did get a bit sweaty, so I advise its worth the extra 5 bucks to get some grips to put in on the heel and the ball of the shoe. Much easier after that. =D"
3,A Fine Introduction,"I come to this reader having read a few Wells novels: ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""The Time Machine"". I didn't know much else about Wells' life or career. In reading this anthology, I found out quite a few new things, though not enough to claim that I'm an expert on the subject. Wells did live a long time, and this anthology uses a lot of space presenting things about Wells that I alreay knew. I know that Bison Books prints editions of ""The Sleeper Awakes"", ""In The Days of the Comet"", and ""The Last War."" The other reviewers of this book seem to miss the point that this book is meant to be an introduction. And an introduction is supposed to have a range and also be complete. A figure like Wells may be impossible to encapsulate in such a small volume, but I think for new readers, this might be the book for you. If you want to know the roots of science-fiction, where else can you look but at the master himself?"
1,botched,"This anthology stinks. I hope that this terrible collection doesn't hamper anyone else's attempt to put together a decently representative collection of Wells material. Huntington and his publishers should have read all of Wells before trying to assemble a collection of his work.Wells remains a major 20th century intellectual--still up for grabs by the right and left, a fugitive in the history of the novel, and a questionable presence in the development of social sciences. I don't think this anthology does justice to Wells, it insults his critics and fans, and it does not tantalize prospective readers.One word: ""Booooo."""
1,Buyer BEWARE! Metal warped in 2 months of grilling,"DO NOT BUY THIS Product!!! I bought three of these as a cheaper replacement for my DCS grill. Two of them are fine, but one warped and the ceramic rods all broke inside of it (that was $60 in rods I also had to replace). I went to return it on Amazon and the window closed for the return (shame on you Amazon, you could learn something from Costco and Home Depot). I contacted the company and they said I had to deal with Amazon. Between Amazon and MusicCityMetals, the consumer is left without a usable product or refund.If either of these companies want to make this right, please contact me."
3,Strong Construction - Poor fit,product is heavy guage stainless steel. Problem is that the plate is not manufactured to be flat. The concave shape makes it difficult to insert lock down the ceramic radiants without breaking them. I had to bend the retaining edge to allow the radiants to lie flat. Replacing the radiants will be a pain as the plate assembles with a set of nuts and screws (unlike the slot and tab of the original).
4,Too factual to be fiction,"Preston Nichols has written a mind blowingly amazing book. It covers subjects ranging from time travel, reality manipulation, and mind control, to rock n' roll, sound engineering, and esoteric physics. Somewhat autobiographical, Music of Time details his many associations with famous musicians from Mark Hamill and Chubby Checkers to Jim Morrison, Beatles to the Beach Boys, and how many of them were involved with the mind control programing at Montauk Base.There are plenty of subtle technical hints concerning radionics, etheric sound shaping, and time travel physics. These diverse subjects have been eloquently woven with the phenomena of music into a very entertaining, provocative, and spellbinding book."
4,"Great story, but something seems to be missing...","""The Music of Time"" is a Montauk-related book that is interesting reading, but lacks power. However, the authors even state that the book was re-written to protect particular people, which did weaken it.The story is mostly about Preston Nichols' involvement with the music industry. As readers of the other Montauk books know, expect an unbelievable story that is far different that the reality of most people."
4,Not as long as they appear...,"These little brushes are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder holes, but that's about all they're good for. I didn't pay close attention to the description, and assumed they were about 9 inches long. They're actually just over 3.5 inches long... far too short to clean inside the feeders."
5,Tiny and Mighty,"I ordered these little brushes to clean my hummingbird feeder, but you would be amazed at how useful they are around the kitchen and around the house. They fit into orifices and crevices when nothing else will. The brush is gentle, but strong. I love it."
5,PLB is perfect for its purpose,"And that purpose is cleaning the feeding ports of hummingbird feeders. These are not for cleaning the bottle or inside of a feeder, but rather just for the little feeding holes and adjacent areas. They fit inside the holes of my perky pet feeders just right. I also use them like a proxy brush to clean the details of the little fake flowers that surround the feeding ports."
4,worked quite well.,To clean the feeding holes in my humming bird feeders they worked very good; but you also need a longer one with about a 30 degree bend in it so you can also reach the inside tips of the flowers ?
3,little brush,"The product was fine, the shipping was way too costly....making the product not a very good buy....probably could have found something similar locally...."
5,Simple design and good quality,Simple design and good quality. Cleans feeder very well and is not showing signs of rust. I would buy again.
5,perfect tool,I use these brushes every time I clean the hummingbird feeders. They are a perfect fit. They look like they will last a while too.
5,perfect for hummingbird feeders,These little brushes can get into any little hole on the hummingbird feeders. They tend to bend a little when the orifice is hard to access but go back to their original shape. We are very happy with them.
5,Perfect for Ports,I have 16 hummingbird feeders in use at all times during our long season (May to October). Keeping these feeders clean is essential. The hardest places to clean in these feeders are no longer an obstacle with these little brushes. They reach in and clean the ports beautifully. They even reach some of the tightest corners in some of my feeders. I feel confident that my feeders are clean now.
5,XZIBIT'S BEST ALBUM EVER,"This album is awesome. It features the hits ""X"" & ""Front 2 Back"". It is produced by Dr. Dre so it has awesome production. It also has some production by DJ Quik. This album is definitley worth buying."
5,Perfect Is The Way You Describe Xzibit's Latest Album!,"Dr. Dre has done it again! His recruiting of Xzibit was a perfect move as Xzibit has created a masterpiece album. Tracks such as ""X"", ""U Know"", ""Best of Things"", and ""Kenny Parker Show 2001"" rock this CD. ""Don't Approach Me"" shows Eminem and Xzibit when they're not making rhymes and their takes on fan pressure. ""Loud and Clear"" ends the album great. ""Get Your Walk On"" is a real uplifting and bumping track. I'm really feeling ""Sorry I'm Away So Much"". It shows you how much X is caring for his kid(s). ""Double Time"" and ""D.N.A."" were not some of my bigfavorites but I could still bounce to them. And finally, ""Alkaholic"" has a very funky beat and X, J-Ro, Tash rock the mike on that track. This album is perfect and is a west coast rap fan's dream. This is a must buy. Gotta get this one!"
5,One of the best...,"This CD definitely goes immediatley into that area marked ""west coast classics."" Xzibit manages to stay tight for almost all the tracks and having Dre's producing and beat behind him doesn't hurt either. The best tracks, in my opinion are: 2. Front 2 Back, 5. X,6. Alkaholik, 10. Dont approach me, 11. Rimz and tires, 12. F---in You right, 13.Best of things, 14. Get your walk on, 15. Sorry I'm away so much, and 16. loud & clear. Most of the other songs are pretty good too, I only listed the really great ones. Anyway, fans of Xzibit, Dre, Eminem, Snoop, Kurupt, and rappers like them should definitely PICK UP THIS ALBUM NOW."
4,xzibit proves his underground worth once again,"im 16, and when i first heard this cd when it came out, i listened to it with an open mind, being a kandi kid and all (plur), i decided on not judgin it. i love muziq of all kinds, esp rap n hip hop, techno n even jungle, and this cd is great. the beats are fly, the lyrics and the artists are wreket.its awesome! give it a try! its fresh..."
5,Xzibit's release is by far the best rap CD of 2000.,"Xzibit is back, and this time he's gone mainstream! This CD produces great beats and rhymes from A-Z. Teamed up with Dre, Xzibit is unstoppable. This disc sounds so original from other rap CDs, I mean most of the music sounds like something other than rap, but the lyrics beg to differ. Xzibit has a great voice which stands out and forces you to listen. Some people are arguing that his lyrics are too simplistic and childish, but those are the kind of people who are only listening to lyrics. I do agree with that on some of the tracks (such as ""X""), but on those very few, if the lyrics are over seen by the great tunes, then those songs will still be very entertaining. My personal favorites on this masterpiece are ""X"", ""Best of Things"" and ""Don't Approach Me"". Those are just the best of the best in my opinion and almost every other tracks are superb as well. Even the low points of the CD are easy to take in. XZIBIT'S RESTLESS IS THE BEST RAP OF 2000!!"
5,Xzibit's new CD... a success!,"Xzibit comes off great on this CD, with Dre producing, and Xzibit rapping, how can you go wrong?? Great album featuring appearances from Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, KRS-One, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Goldie Loc, DJ Quik, King T, Tash, Butch Cassidy, and others. The beats are great, but then again, Dre is producing, so what else would they be? My favorite songs are ""U Know"", ""Been A Long Time"", ""Alkaholik"", ""Alkaholik"", and ""D.N.A."" And all the other songs are great as well, I definitely recommend you pick this up, as it is a great album."
4,Toast To The Boogie,"I am mostly a fan of hip hop from 1984 to 1992. The emphasis on image and the lack of creativity of many of the artists today, sickens me. But when I hear artists like Xzibit, I am thoroughly convinced that hip hop continues to evolve. Many people first laid ears on Xzibit on Dre's Chronic 2001. His tight rhymes and rugged delivery could not go ignored. The long awaited ""Restless"" executive produced by Dr Dre will not disappoint. It's obvious that X to da Z is a product of the Old Skool and it's evident on songs like ""Kenny Parker Show 2001."" The album is rich in booming bass and the lyrics are tight. Althought production quality is not as smooth as anything on Chronic 2001, it is suited perfectly to Xzibit. Check it out, definitely worth adding to the collection."
2,three good songs,"Forgot to mention in the previous review that ""Double Time,"" ""Best of Things"" are real good songs. The best song is ""Don't Approach Me"" feat Eminem. It's an EM song featuring Xzibit and the track is off the hook as X and Em trade verses explaining why the reasons for whay they're attitudes may seem so shitty."
2,Overhyped and trite,"Don't get me wrong, Xzibit used to be quite the ill MC back in the day but this collection is just too overproduced and overhyped for words. Too much bravado, too less substance. I guess the album title for this CD suits it since Xzibit and his production team seemed ""restless"" in the studio while recording these lackluster tracks. The only people who get ""five stars"" in this case is his record label for overhyping and overpromoting this unworthy album like crazy."
1,Plummet,"Xzibit's Restless gets worse and worse with each listen. The first time I was a little generous on this album and it received three stars. But now going back trying to listen to it...it just aint hittin on nothing. This album is complete garbage. I had so many high expectations for this album...but am extremely disappointed. There's only about three good songs. Xzibit's aggressiveness and lyrical prowess is nowhere to be found, the beats are too commercialized and poppy sounding...it just makes me want to throw up. To me this is the equivalent of Faboulous' album, in terms of wackness...and I wouldn't recommend it all....not even to burn it from a friend. His other albums are exponentially greater than this trash...Lets just hope his next album `Man Vs. Machine' is nothing like this. Don't buy this...and avoid it all costs."
2,OverHyped,I kept hearing Xzibit this&Xzibit that so finally after hearing this set i can't figure out all the Hype? He has a Allright flow but nothing here shows me what all the hype has been about.as much as I Dig DJ QUIK&I Respect Dr.Dre they can't save this set.despite all the Hype something is missing here for me.
5,Xzibits worse album but still ok,Xzibit is one of my favorite rappers but come on. This CD was a joke. Only a few good songs which was about 3-4 of them and the rest werent anything special.Luckily Xzibit got better with Man vs Machine and Weapons of Mass Destruction.
1,Deeply Penetrating Critique,"Xzibit (perhaps better known by his real name, Kyle Korzybski) has finally produced his confessional album. Though this work may surprise some, others of us in the know fully expected what is revealed herein: hysterical panegyrics to ecstatic catamitical experiences, obsessive referencing of his intercrural initiations, and dreamy fantasies of The Glory That Was Greased [sic]....Young Kyle's revelation was a long time a-comin'...and the comin' has definitely exposed his position as deeply in arrears. This is a seminal work, no doubt about it. But years of rough treatment by the critics has left a gaping hole in Kyle's oeuvre, with no one now who can fill it. Perhaps only G-Unit can measure up to the task, which requires the utmost probity. It would seem to be fertile ground to plow."
2,Gone downhill,"Xzibit's debut was awesome. his 2nd was very good. this being his 3rd was OK, nothing special. and obviously man vs machine has to be his worst album. Anyway, onto the review, this overall was a major disappointment - it just doesn't have enough good songs on it. Sure, there are some gems, such as X, Kenny Parker Show, Get Your Walk On, and Sorry I'm Away So Much, but thats just about it. There are some not bad/average tracks, then the rest are pathetic. Alkaholic is one of the worst songs, it has one of the most corniest beats ever, and the lyrical content is pathetic. Only buy this if you are a die-hard Xzibit fan. If you want Xzibit at his best, then get At The Speed Of Life, and 40 Dayz 40 Nightz, because they are both far better than this."
2,The downfall of X,"Here it begins. WE're no longer gonna get another album like ""Speed of life"" or ""40days/nights"" from him no more. THe commercial bug has bitten. Well hey, he's got to make his money. Though this album does have its share of party anthems (the alkaholik song in particular) I thought the production really had a lot to be improved upon! Come on Dre, you can do better than this [junk]. Old school Xzibit fans, dont get this -- you'll be disappointed. If you're lookin to get a feel for X, well I guess you can pick this one up."
5,Good stuff...,"I really think this is the hottest album to come out... from anywhere.. there are no 'filler tracks' on it, no annoying skits, and the only non-rapping track is the introduction... the production is from many different producers but X seems to meld into every different beat, finding the perfect lyrics to accompany the producers effort... dont approach me is a very hot song and eminems verse is blazin... the only thing i dont like about this is Kokanes guest spot... i cant stan his high pitched scratchy voice... hot LP and hopefully more to come from the illest..."
4,Great debut into mainstream music,"X has been around for a while, but this is his mainstream music solo debut. He dosen't dissapoint. Although Xzibit drops his best stuff for Dre, Snoop, and em, this is not a bad cd. The only bad songs are DNA and rimz and tires. The best songs are Front to back, You Know, X, Alkoholik, KPS 2001, Double Time, Dont approach me, ****'in you right, Get your walk on, and Sorry I'm away.....This is a good buy it's not great but its good."
5,One of the best,"After numerous appearances on top rappers albums x to the z has finally proven he is a player with the big boys with his album restless. There isnt one song on this album i dont like as each track is provided with some tight beats and unbelievable lyrics. the best tracks on this album are, front2back, u know, dont approach me, x and best of things. if u are a fan of the west-coast rap dont even hesitate to pick this album as u wont be disapointed."
2,Not as good as I hoped for.,"RESTLESS has it's strong points, but not enough to make up for the tracks with weak rhymes and even weaker beats. Xzibit is a tight MC, but this is not his best work."
5,Destined to be a hip hop classic!,"It is very rare for a CD to have more than a few good tracks, this is how I rate what's good and what's not. With this CD, you can just put your player on random/shuffle and you can rest assured knowing whatever track that comes up will be good. Among my favorites are ""Alkaholic"", ""X"" and ""Don't Approach Me"".This CD made me an Xzibit fan. It is destined to become a hip hop classic such as Snoop Doggy Dogg's ""Doggystyle"". A hip hop collection is incomplete without this CD."
5,X to the Z Gets to be Man of the Hour,"Before Xzibit got to be in the spotlight, he was rapping for compilations on Dr. Dre album's and now, it's the other way around. This album is pure and original with great new sound systems that you can't get sick of. ""X"" and ""Front 2 Back"" and ""DNA"" are really great songs. This is a real winner."
5,Restless By Xzibt,I think this CD is Phat. It is one of my best Cd's. Most of the songs on it are good. I recomend this Rap CD to anyone that like Rap.
4,dope but expected better,"alright I have been waiting on this one for a long time now and i got it the day it came out and xzibit did not fail to deliver some dope tracks with some good flow but coming from xzibit i did expect better. the tracks that standout are the tracks that he is alone on like ""get yo walk on,"" ""best of things"", and ""front to back"" but the tracks with snoop, eminem, dre and nate dogg fail to live up to the high standards of xzibit, there are no bad tracks on this album but like i said coming from xzibit i simply expected better, definitely worth a buy though -One"
2,Xcruciating. Xcess. Xcrement.,"Being the biggest Xzibit fan that exits, I am sorely disappointed with the album and direction Xzibit is headed. Restless will sell more albums than his previous releases, but the quality of his lyrical work has drifted into what is wrong with L.A. rap now. Too much gloss, not enough substance. Weak attempts at funk don't manage to measure up to the excitement of Xzibit's character. Lyrically, he's pretty decent, but not great. The hooks are too wordy for what he's attempting. He's been saying this album is 120% better than his last album- he's dreaming. E-Swift, Thayod, Sir Jinx and DJ Muggs brought real heat to those previous albums. Dr. Dre and company don't really do anything for this album that is senses shattering. It's an attempt to include Xzibit to the ""L.A."" sound, but that sound is played. It's time for new music, something exciting. This ain't it. ""Only in the money for the fame Xtra large, that's Paparazzi."""
3,Takes time to get use to,"When I first listened to this CD I thought, this sucks. I felt there was way to much volience and not enough substance. But while on a long trip i heard this CD again and realized it was really produced well. Not only are the beats memorable, but some of the raps are surperb. My recommendation: Listen to this one at least twice before making up your mind."
4,"It's good, but I thought it would be better","Being a former member of the Alkaholics and a veteran of two previous albums, I thought this cd would be better. I like the cd, but it just should have been better. There are two crappy songs on this lp that drag the album down. Most of the beats are good, but they are not outstanding. I like to put a cd on and not have to skip songs, but I skips songs with this cd. The first ten songs are bumping, but X seemed to struggle finishing the cd with good beats. It didn't help that he made that terrible song about thanking him for banging so many women, which was so stupid and juvenile it isn't even funny. Dre should have done more producing on this cd. It just seems to stop flowing after a while and he needed some more songs to finish the cd. Don't get me wrong, this is a good cd and I would recommend it to anyone, but I think it rates no better than 3 1/2 stars."
3,NICE BEATS BUT................,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS CD AND BEING A RAP FAN,I LISTEN MORE TO THE MUSIC THAN THE LYRICS BUT ON THIS CD I LISTENED TO THE LYRICS AND IT BLEW ME BACK THAT ALL XZIBIT RAPS ABOUT IS ""BLOWING THE BACK OF SOMEONE'S HEAD OUT"" AND SOME WOMAN ""RIDING"" HIM.IT'S MORE TO LIFE THAN SEX AND VIOLENCE AND AFTER HEARING THIS CD,I'M READY TO TURN AWAY FROM RAP ALTOGETHER!!!!!!! DON'T GET IT TWISTED, I LIKE THE STYLE THAT XZIBIT PUT OUT THERE BUT HE NEEDS TO BROADEN HIS RAP VOCABULARY SOME MORE. SINCE I LIKE THE MUSIC,I WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS CD IN INSTRUMENTAL!!!!!"
3,ok but not what i expected,"When i first heard the song X I was real excited about this album. Well now its here, and I have to say its ok but not what I expected. Its not his best work, listen to his first two cds, but it will get a couple spins in my cd player before it goes on the shelf. Some of my fav tracks are X, Dont Approach Me, Best Of Things, Get Your Walk On, and Sorry Im Away So Much. Better than Dre's CD, so I suggest you give it a listen."
3,Weathertech mats,The sides could be higher for very muddy environments as I have found that debris still finds its way in copious amounts onto the car's carpet. Weathertech could also change the tactile feel of these mats. They are too stiff.
5,Love this album,Excellent instrumental Christmas album. Very unique!This will get you into the Christmas spirit quickly!
5,No Christmas Music Collection is Complete Without It!,"I originally had this album on LP back in the 70's and then, about 10 years ago, I ran across a budget label CD of it and snatched it up without hesitation. If I had to describe these rockin' instrumental treatments of traditional Christmas tunes in one word, I think the word would be ""perky"". This is usually the first holiday music CD I grab for when the season rolls around and I never get tired of this fine recording from year-to-year; it never sounds dated and it will put you in a festive mood as soon as you hit the ""play"" button- heads will be bobbin' and toes will be tappin'! ""The Ventures'Christmas Album"" belongs on a list of the Top 10 All-Time Best Christmas Albums."
5,Christmas Is Worthy Of This album,"I am a huge Ventures fan, and of surf music in general. I am however, not the biggest fan of Christmas music. It is all sooooo stale! But as I figured the only two artists that could possibly do a Christmas album that I can swallow, would be Elvis, and The Ventures. Well, as any of you Ventures fans out there know, The Ventures Rule! My friends and family are all happy now that I have Christmas music to play during the holidays."
3,"Decent translation, but not well-sourced","While I agree with other reviewers that this is a better translation than Cleaves, it is not very well-sourced. Onon makes many assertions based on ""I know this because I am a Mongol"" which are not, as far as I can tell, supportable. I would recommend Onon for his readability, but the two-volume Igor De Rachewiltz translation has far better annotations and commentary for scholarly purposes. Onon's assertions (especially about Buddhism in the Mongol Empire) should probably be taken with numerous grains of salt.Neither translation is particularly affordable for the average person, which is why we have interlibrary-loan."
5,Wonderful translation -- much more accurate than Cleaves,"This is an excellent translation of the Mongoliin Nuuts Tovchoo (Secret History of the Mongols). It is much more accurate that the Francis Cleaves edition. Onon fixes Cleaves' mistakes and explains why they are wrong. There are also good explanations of the mistakes of many of the Chinese interlinear notes in the early manuscript. Besides the outrageous price, this book is a ""must have!"""
5,Must have book.,"Interested in Mongols' History? Think you know Chinggis khaan (Genghis Khan)? If you haven't read this book gotta have this one then. Without it you don't know a thing about Chinggis khaan. There are lots of translations of ""The Secret History of the Mongols."" But this. This is the best translation work! Urgunge Onon's translation is incomparable with other translations."
5,Very good book,As a new-yorker I would recomment to use this book as a travel guide. I'm not sure about hotels info in this book but attractions coverage is great!
2,Just ok...,"Be prepared for a huge box to arrive. The calendar is all it says, but for some reason, it does not thrill me. The colors seem subdued and the size is a bit smaller than I expected. It's just ok. I had a free calendar given to me every year and it was bright and larger and vibrant. Due to the economy, they don't give them out anymore. So I bought this one. Great shipping time and no problems with that."
1,Made it ten minutes in,"I got ten minutes or so into this movie and just had to stop. The movie looks like it was shot in a world that has given up on electric lighting its so dark. The camera work is awful and just adds to the mess.The acting is just terrible. It looks like these guys are just reading off cue-cards with no feeling whatsoever. Furthermore, the voices just don't match what you are seeing on the screen its like a Japanese B-movie.On to the content: in the ten minutes there were at least 40 one-liners that were supposed to get laughs. I did not laugh at one of them, not a chuckle. Not even an internal thought of ""that was funny"".Maybe the movie picks up after the first ten minutes or so, but after witnessing what I did there was no way I was going to take the risk that the rest would be just as awful."
1,please god give me back my hour and 34 minutes,"before partaking in this trainwreck, i read countless reviews calling it bad and about three lies calling it good.the fact the internet even offers a piece of trash of this magnitude makes me afraid of the world wide web on a scale more epic then the fear 80s children such as myself felt for freddie i live in your dreams bitch kruger.if my language is sketchy please excuse me i just drank countless beers to make that trash heap bearable. please dont take this post as a reason to watch this film just to see if it can be as bad as truly described. if you are considering the latter i strongly suggest you play russian roulette with a fully loaded gun for the outcome would be far better than the memories i will now take with me to the grave.the saddest part of my post, my evening, and my life is now trying to figure out how and why i loved the book."
2,The movie has NOTHING on the book.,"Tucker Max is hilarious, but the movie falls far short of his comedic genius... the guy who plays tucker comes off as a complete loser...not at all the confident self assured guy we see in his books. Its like in the movie the actor comes off as one of those couched bags who try to hard to be 'cool' and just ends up seeming desperate. The friends in the movie come off as dumb too. Tucker's books are the best....the movie, the worst."
1,"It wasn't funny, it was cruel","I'm a woman and I loved the first book. I expected a funny, sharp movie. Instead I got a movie with horrible lighting and production, characters I hated, and just general grossness. I loved Slingblade in the book--and I just finished AFF and I loved his Mr. Peepers routine...but in the movie he sounded like a serial killer, and frankly I just don't like serial killers. I guess I don't have a good sense of humor."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!,A very boring movie based on a very funny book. This movie is not funny and actually a snooze; I had to literally force myself to pay attention to it. The story is so cliched and just not humorous. The characters are unimaginative & uninteresting. I didn't care about a single character in this movie. The Drew character was horribly acted. The movie itself looks like amateur hour - I've seen better production on Youtube & Funny or Die. I would not tell anyone to waste their time on this flick.
3,Not as good as the book,This movie has received both damning criticism and loving praise. It deserves neither: it's just an ok film that will entertain you while you watch it. I hope Tucker makes more films and gets it right in the next one.
2,the book was better,"another case of ""the book was better""the book was roll on the floor (pee in your pants) funnythe movie was hard to watch, not funny, poorly acted, poorly directed, a huge disappointment."
1,"I don't know if they erve beer in hell, but this movie is in a continuous loop.","I never thought I'd see a movie so bad that it makes ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" look like ""Avatar"", but here it is. A comedy that isn't funny, a relationship picture that makes all relationships look like inexpensive financial transactions, a buddy flick if your friends are people who should be left gagged in a ditch with alligators. Everyone associated with this movie should have their SAG cards burned in public, and the so called ""writers and producers"" should be forced to make documentaries in Waziristan on a $1 a day budget. No need to talk about whoever directed this mess, it has no apparent direction.Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I watch a lot of movies. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because I can't give it no stars."
3,Good guy movie,I wouldn't recommend watching it with your girlfriend or wife unless your looking for a reason to start a fight. It is what all guys aspire to be but most don't or won't admit it. I watched it with my two girlfriends and they got bored with it and focused on each other in the couch. I had to pause it for other activities.
1,READ THE BOOK!! movies not worth your money,"I'm only giving this movie one star because there is no option to give it NO STARS!this is nothing like the book. I expected a reenactment of the funniest parts of the book or the most memorable. nothing there was only one scene form the book (which was hilarious) everything else was a flunk I would never recommend this movie to anyoneGo read the bookI Hope They Serve Beer In Hellit was 5-stars hilarious and raunchy he's a man-whore and I love it. don't get this movie! its a waste of money.I felt like the characters weren't portrayed right, and the acting was pretty poor I had a great image in my head after I read the book once I saw this movie it ruined it for me. Please spare yourself and DONT BUY IT!"
2,pretty much a waste of time,ive read his stories online and they are pretty funny. even if they may be made up he still tells them really well. but this movie was terrible. it went too far sometimes. this is one of those movies that is best enjoyed with the people it is about not for a large audience. the only good part of this movie were the hot girls. the dude who played tucker showed some pretty bad acting. what a waste of time
2,Ah....disappointing.,Disappointing. I saw the preview then decided to go out and purchase the movie. Clips from the preview were the best parts. Started out slooooow. Got funny after the middle. Sucked in the end.
4,Pretty funny,Hilarious movie. Showed it to a few friends and they agreed. Def a a guy movie with alot of college/toilet humor. Gets a little boring near the end though.
1,Beer in Hell is frankly awful.,"Lets see, mix a horrible script with awkward dialogue and amateurish acting/directing/lighting & you get an extremely low budget, incredibly unfunny, mess like this.Rotten Tomato's has BIH at 22%, which is probably a bit generous. Maybe 2-3 laughs in the entire movie. A complete waste of time, and possibly the worst movie I've seen in years."
1,90 minutes of pure hell.,"I'll make this short, as I already feel I've wasted enough time watching this twice. This 'movie' is painfully unfunny. The dialogue, lighting, acting, script is horrible. Further, now that I realize that it is all based on lies, it's even more pathetic. Save your time and money and skip this ""movie""."
1,It had potential,"but the Tucker character is just unlikable, even though that is what the premise of the movie is about, so I found it hard to like the movie in general. It was fun watching the Drew character, though."
1,Total Waste!,"I received the book as a Christmas gift and couldn't put it down. It has to be one of the funniest (albeit crude) books that I have ever read. Now, normally when you watch a movie based on a book, you expect it to deviate a little bit from the stories or storyline, but in the case of ""I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell"" that it is a gross understatement. I spent the entire 104 useless minutes of the movie wondering when they would show something even close to anything contained in the book. In fact, there is only one scene in the movie that is taken from the book - it's actually the funniest part of the movie. Overall, don't waste your money buying, renting or even borrowing the movie from a friend. Just read the book and end it there."
1,Glad i didn't watch the movie before reading the book,"This movie sucked more than a crack head looking for his next rock. The book on the other hand, had me rolling on the floor laughing. Skip the movie and stick to the book!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"You know how they say the movie is never as good as the book, this is the best example. Funnest book I ever read, cheesiest movie I ever watched."
3,Funny,"It was funny, but not over the top funny. Like all movies it had it's funny parts and boring parts. Wish Tucker had a little my heart or emotion, but that's who he is."
1,This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.,"I have seen some god-awful movies over the years, (e.g. Leonard Part Six, Howard the Duck and Gigli) but I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell is by far the worst movie that I have ever suffered through.The characters are all douchebags who are completely irredeemable, and the jokes, such as there are, are dated, lame and unfunny. The production values are atrocious, especially the lighting. I've seen student films that looked better than this.Don't waste your time watching this, to say nothing of your money. Trust me, the two hours that you'll save not watching IHTSBIH could be put to better use by doing just about anything else."
3,Raunchy and definitely disgusting,"I think a lot of us have had friends like Tucker (Matt Czuchry) - totally self centered and wanting only one thing out of life (and it ain't to read a good book). Then there's Dan (Geoff Stults), nice guy getting led around by his out-of-control friend. And Drew (Jesse Bradford), woman hater until he meets the right woman.This movie is totally outrageous, offensive to almost everyone especially women and especially women with disabilities, has the MOST disgusting scenes I've ever seen on the screen or in real life - BUT despite all that it's kind of like a car wreck that you can't tear your eyes away from. You sit there and wait to see what else could possibly happen in this movie."
3,Hmmmm . . .,"A tale of debauchery that is rampant with immature humor, vulgarity, sex and female nudity. In other words, a guy film. Based on a popular book about the sexual exploits of a dude who thinks too much about himself and ignores others. There were some surprisingly valid dialogue scenes in this movie, especially when the fiance' chewed out Tucker and when the stripper girl told Drew off with nerd talk. WHEN WATCHED: 10/25/2010; MY GRADE: B minus (a lot less if you don't like these types of guy films)."
3,"Not terrible, not great","The actor playing Tucker did an okay performance. He nailed a lot of the scenes where Tucker was calm and sinister, but every time he tried to do an excited, yelling, hyped up, ""We're going to the strip club"" kind of Tucker, he sounded artificial and looked like a tool. This actor was definitely not playing himself because you can't fake scenes like that.Some of the scenes were way too long. For instance, when Tucker is at the bar trying to convince his friends to go to Salem, this really dragged out and was unnecessary.There were a lot of good one-liners, but there were also some bad ones.I thought the jail scene was really funny and the bathroom scene in the hotel lobby was hysterical. I might have given this movie a 4 star (3.5 rounded up), but the ending was awful because of Tucker's speech. No guy would ever get up there in front of a wedding party like that and say the crude things he did. Not even Tucker Max."
3,Should Tucker die?,"To mark a wedding oncoming of one of them three friends had got a bachelor party with a genre-style usual set of happy-ended misfortunes embedding their very egos by deploying sexism and rude slang.Also all them are very keen males something same gender attractive is in the air.I have no clue whether this work is linked to ""John Tucker Must Die"" but it could be logical also this is of Tucker Max."
5,As good as they get,"There are only two types of people that won't enjoy this movie: Feminists and the kind of guys that get picked on by guys like Tucker. If you don't fall into one of those categories you'll find it hilarious. Non-stop one liners and shock humor. If you enjoyed college, you'll enjoy this."
4,Very entertaining,"The book is extremely funny... it not meant for anyone that is ""uptight"" but the majority of people will find it entertaining."
3,Crudely humorous,"A modern day 'Animal House' as far as the crude jokes & situations are concerned - but lacking in any socially redeeming values. Don't spend much for this one (I didn't!), then pass it on, so to speak, and wash your hands! 'The Good Wife' will never be the same..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,"It's one of the worst movies ever created. The dialogue and plot are COMPLETELY unlikeable and unbelievable. IT IS NOT FUNNY, or ENTERTAINING. I am sorry i am cockblocking the people selling the movie, but it is there fault for buying it in the first place."
1,Excreble-TRUTH IN ADVERTISING,"I like a politically incorrect, rude movie as the next guy, but REALLY?!! This is a ""be careful what you wish for..."" at its worst. Any film whose climax is punctuated by showing in excruciating detail, someone inflicted with explosive, diarrhea, has created a film for those seeking the LOWEST common denometer. This brings new meaning to the expression ""blowing chunks"" YUCK!!! GUARANTEED NOT TO BE A DATE FILM! ie. this is ""Trainspotting"" for Cretins! Be afraid, BE VERY AFRAID!!!"
4,Definitely a Flick for the Guys,"This one's hilarious...but most likely only to the male viewer. In my opinion, it's much too raw and gross for the ladies. I got a kick out of it because when I was young I had a group of friends very much like this trio. I need to say no more. In the vein of ""The Hangover"", it's must for those who love silly, gross, adult humor with lots of profanity and downgrading. I gave it 4 stars. Watch with caution...definitely not for the kids."
5,"sic, twisted and soooo funny","If you drink you either see these people or you are these people scence after scene. And how could you go bad with bridget the midget and traci lords. And for the people complaining that its filmed bad and its too dark buy a new tv and use HDMI cables, you must not be getting the full effect."
3,For smaller rooms,"I purchased this diffuser because I read reviews that it worked very well. I guess the room I have it in is too big because I can't really smell the scented oils. Still, it works well in the immediate vicinity of the diffuser itself, and would be good in the bathroom."
2,Cheaply made,"I bought two of these, because I have quite a few ties and belts, and from the pictures it looked like they were pretty well put together. And I suppose they work. Which is to say, they provide the normal force to counteract gravity and hold ties and belts off the ground. And they haven't actually fallen apart. But the second I took them out of the box, a good number of the pegs were wobbly, with no way to tighten them down, and several looked as though they would fall out if you were to test them with the weight of two ties instead of one. And it wasn't a problem in shipping, because the packaging they came in was great.If I just wanted a piece of wood with some cheap nails in it, I would have gone to the hardware store and done it myself. Come to think of it, next time I'm just going to go to the hardware store and do it myself."
4,Good value,"The item was a little darker than expected but looks good, a couple of the chrome prongs were a little loose but still work fine for holding a tie. I attached it to my wall in about 5 minutes and most of that time was bringing in and taking my drill back to the garage. I am happy with it. I had looked at the same item on the company's website but ordered through Amazon because it saved me about $5 on cost and shipping."
3,You Get What you Pay for.,"I noticed that the hanging equipment for the tie rack was sufficient. However, upon installation the plugs for screw holes were too small, and immediately fell out of their housing, and have since been lost. Otherwise, the rack works quite well for my ties, and a couple of my belts, too."
2,Classic that is sadly out of date,"I purchased this book after it being quoted in one of Gerald Loeb's books. Sadly while it offered some good advice I was disappointed in the writing style and it made for boring burdensome reading. I advise all readers to skip this one and buy William O'Neal's: ""The successful investor"" for a quick clear read with the same basic information and updated in modern form.Here are some quotes from this book:It is better to own the wrong stock at the right time than the right stock at the wrong time. (Bear markets take them all down).Play a trend and get out when it seems to be stopping.Never hold on to a loser. Sell it!Don't talk about your investments until you are out of them.(Excellent advice)Great advice is buried in these pages, but there are much better books out there that are effortless to read."
4,History of Creation,"Colin Gunton believes (and rightfully so) that creation cannot truly be understood except in a Trinitarian conception. Understanding God as the Holy Trinity lays the foundation for all other theology and in particular creation.Gunton weaves together both Historical and Systematic Theology to present a case for understanding the Trinity and Creation. He intertestingly notes that when the doctrine of the Trinity fell into dispute or was just placed upon the shelves of church history to collect dust that the effect was evident upon man.Only a proper understanding of the Trinity will bring balance between the transcedence and immanence of God. God and his relation to his creation can only be properly understood when God is TrinityThis is an excellent book, but one that will take work to get through. In the end the effort put out will be worth while."
4,Expressway to your heart,Takes me back....Great Philly Group! Fun!Our Band Covered their songs at the time ....the CD has nice reproduction nice sound....not like some thin 60's Reproductions!
4,Muay Home Study,The quality of the production threw me off at the start but then quickly redeems itself with content. This is a great overall training tool. I have had some Muay Thai training which helped me assimilate into the drills with some ease. The one thing I would say about it is that some of the basics of punching and stepping are quickly over viewed which could get frusterating to some one just learning from the start. But overall I really appreciated the full spectrum of the training provided with this home study course. Well worth the investment!
3,Worht it,"It showed up and is silver aluminum color (made of plastic). However the picture was black (description did say aluminum color). It's a bit cheaply made (but at a cheap price) and gives ok protection though there's not much foam to protect the PS3 and I wouldn't want to drop it or send it through airport baggage (should be ok for carry-on). It's certainly more durable than the cardboard box, and much easier to organize and loadup. At $35 I'd definately say it's worth it if you cart your PS3 around frequently."
3,ok layout but crapy design,"well when i first got it i was happy because it was cheaper and more protective then my last case, but then i started to feel it, the sides of the case is aluminum but the top and the bottom are made of this cheap thin lair of plastic, if that would have been aluminum also this would have been a super case but with out the top and bottom being aluminum its still a good protective case but that crap plastic breaks with the slightest hit potentially damaging your ps3 witch sits right behind it. and the inside is made of this weird hard foam stuff in my opinion that should have been more thought out they should have put something a little softer inside."
5,Excellent Case,"I have the PSP version of the Intec Pro Gamer's Case, so with my PS3 purchase, it only came natural to me to also purchase the PS3 version. I was not disappointed by any means, with ample room and protective abilities. A must-buy for the PS3 gamer on the go."
1,Bid Disappointment - PS3 Pro Gamer's Case Silver,"I purchase my PS3 Console and accessories from Amazon.com so they would be here for Christmas. No Problems. Then, I saw the PS3 pro Gamer's Case of which I purchase two on the 16th of December 2009. They arrived today. And I am sad to say that after all of the many years I have purchased items from Amazon.com this is my biggest disappointment. My PS3 Console would not even fit in the case. This stinks. I was about to send the other one to my Godson as a birthday present, since he has a PS3 set-up also. Good thing I tested mine before sending the other. I am so disappointed that I am not going to attempt to send them back to Amazon. I am going to take the loss and have them both destroyed. The cases may be good for something, but not for the PS3 I just recently purchased. This stinks! Amazon - Please keep these out of your inventory.James K. Bryant"
4,"A great ""we just broke up"" CD that touches your heart","I listen to the radio at work and heard ""Come Around"" and instantly called to find out who the artist was. The same day I ordered the CD and wasn't disappointed with the rest of the tracks. I especially love Keep Me and Hello Old Friend. They remind me of old friends and old loves...not a bad distraction while you're plugging away at work."
4,THE BEST,"Kim Richey has done it all! She has been a country singer and now she has done a WONDERFUL crossover into pop with her new album ""Glimmer"". This is the best CD of her career. The standout song of the album is most definetly ""Come Around"" (which also appears on the ""For Love of the Game"" soundtrack). It is a haunting song that deals with the ups and downs of love. This CD is the best. If you love a little bit of country and a little bit of pop, then you will love the new one by Kim Richey!"
4,"Very good, but very different","Having read all the comments about this album, there is one thing for sure, Kim Richey's fans are very particular with the way they would like their music presented. Having said that, this new album may not excite an old fan as much as a new fan. I like what I've heard so far regardless of the talk about the production differences. You may recall that when you heard Bitter Sweet for the first time the production was different than the first album, too. Yes, I agree, it's mellower than I would have liked but I attribute that to Kim growing as a person and a songwriter more than the production wizardry. Believe it or not, this album works well with Rod Stewart's ""A Spanner in the Works"" (yes, I said Rod Stewart) which is another reflective type of album.Stand out tracks are ""The Way it Never Was"", ""Hello Old Friend"" and contrary to what others have said ""Good at Secrets"".Keep surprising us, Kim!"
5,When will this woman get more well-deserved radio play?,"I really enjoyed Kim's first two albums and was really looking forward to this one. It doesn't disappoint. She's a strong songwriter with a beautifully clear voice. Like Lucinda Wiliams' last release, ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"", every time I listen to this I like it more. What I can't figure out is why she doesn't get more airplay on radio, even alternative adult stations. I think it's because they don't know quite how to categorize her music - country, folk, pop-rock, all of the above. It doesn't need to be categorized. It's just great music."
3,Check out her earlier stuff,"There are a few great songs on here, but overall it pales in comparison to her 2 previous releases. She without a doubt has one of the most beautiful voices and is one of the most talented songwriters anywhere near Nashville. It seems she's really struggling to find a niche in the world of music, and in my opinion this album doesn't hit the mark. Definitely check out here earlier material. I saw her perform several of these songs (as well as earlier ones) in a musty little tavern in Ballard, WA, and she was fully into the singer/songwriter/accoustic guitar vein, and it worked very well. Except there were 2 far less talented people on stage with her and I had to suffer thru listening to them performing their songs, as well. At any rate, I will continue to follow her career and hope she rebounds from this album with something less pop and overly produced."
5,Her best CD!,"I stumbled across this fine artist a year ago or so. Since then I've managed to get all the albums together. This is by far the best. It has sweet songs like ""hello old friend"" and bitter(-sweet) songs like ""didn't I"". This shows how much talent for songwriting she has. Melodies that stay for you for days or lyrics that make you think, smile. I can only recommend it to anyone who likes modern country music at its best!"
3,Only Heard One Song...,"I've only heard one song: ""Come Around."" It was playing one day on an episode of ""General Hospital."" I liked it so much (they played the whole thing) that I decided to order the CD. I really hope I like it, and I think I will, with everyone's positive reviews. I tried looking her up on the Internet, on Napster, mp3.com, etc, and there was absolutely nothing! It's incredible how unknown she is. Also sad, seeing how such singers as Britney Spears, who don't write their own songs and are just manufactured by record companies, are known worldwide."
2,Truly disappointing.,I like Kim Richey a lot. This collection is not representative of her spunk and unique character. The arrangements are boring and the lyrics uninspiring. Pass over this one. Just about any of her other albums are better than this one.
3,She can do better!,"Kim Richey, as most of the reviews note, is a fine talent with a great voice, strong lyrics and the music to support her gifts... so why didn't she use them to the fullest on this CD? The first few songs go together, sound like one, and don't have energy. The faster songs are not engaging enough to lift the slower, more introverted ones up, so consequently, the CD doesn't move well. To me, the overall effect is disappointing. Yes, there are some real keepers here. But this CD needed more variety. The lyrics tell of some tough love situations. She needs to find a man and get happy! Looking forward to the next one, Kim. Also, if you like Kim Richey's music, check out Jann Arden and fall deeply in love with another talented singer/songwriter!"
1,Big Disappointment,"Kim Richey's new ""sound"" is a huge disappointment. My whole family loves ""Bitter Sweet""... the tunes and words stick in your head; the banjo, guitar and dobro and Kim's voice rings true. ""Glimmer"" is just one more boring concession to some producer's idea of what sells (please, not another Sarah McLachlan!!!), and Kim's heart doesn't seem in it. Not one song is memorable. The next thing you know Allison Kraus will go mainstream... oh no, not her too."
2,Zzzzzzz,"I am in more of an agreement with the Amazon reviewer. This is a good album if you're looking for substitute sleeping pills. (Warning -- if you're going to drive, play her first album instead.) There's nothing here that grabs me like the first two albums did -- it really does feel overly produced. In reference to our local station, WXPN, I did hear them play something the other day and my first thought was ""great! - Kim Richey"". That didn't last long as it was followed by ""why are they playing this watered down pop?"""
3,a bit of a letdown,"I loved Kim Richey's first two albums, and eagerly awaited the release of her third. Upon listening, however, my excitement turned to disappointment. It's not that it's not a good album per se, the problem is it's not a good Kim Richey album. There is a conspicuous lack of banjo, steel guitar, dobro, and other traditional instruments that were the basis of the sound of the first two albums. As a result, the songs suffer from a relative sameness throughout. The slick pop production also muddles the ""Kim Richey sound"" that marked her previous releases. What's left sounds less like the country/rock/folk fusion that made her first two albums wonderful, and more like early Sheryl Crow. While I like Sheryl Crow, that's not what I buy Kim Richey for. I seem to be in the minority opinion among her fans, but my advice to those interested in extrodinary Americana/Alternative Country music: get Kim Richey and Bittersweet, and leave Glimmer in the Pop section where it unfortunately belongs."
3,Are the train's wheels a choking hazard?,"I bought this a few days ago for my 10 month old son. The first time he played with it, he spent over an hour exploring all the features!! For the most part, we're both very happy with it. Last night, though, I was looking at the wheels of the little train. Since my son loves to bag his toys on the tile floor, it seems that the wheels could break off, and cause a choking hazard. Well, it's no problem to simply take the train away, but I wish I'd bought a toy that he could *completely* enjoy!"
5,Great product & Chicco has strong toys,"My one year old loves this table, although he is walking, I have playgroup & it's great for those 9,10mth olds that need support standing. My son has not fiqured out the lego type blocks, he just enjoys flipping them around the room. Easy to wipe clean.Thanks for a great toy!!!"
5,This is a Fabulous Toy!,"My 15 month old daughter loves this table. She doesn't walk yet and is still at the cruising stage. She likes this toy because she can pull up on it and play with it while standing up. The side with the faux Legos on it doesn't interest her much, but it doesn't matter. The side of the table with the train, phone, and other activities on it keeps her very busy. I would recommend this table to anyone who wants to keep their baby busy for a good 10 to 15 minutes at a time and for anyone who wants to encourage their child to pull up, cruise, or walk."
3,Train is too loud,"We bought this table for my daughter's first birthday. She has played with it some but seems afraid of the train. When it moves around on the track, it makes a very irritating, loud screeching sound. It almost overpowers the very real sounding train noise that accompanys it. I'm hoping that as she gets older she will playwith it more. Now, she only pulls the blocks out and throws them on the floor."
5,Great fun!,"My 10 month old loves this table. He uses the train and phone more like hammers, but he loves to wind the track and then watch it spin until it quits. It keeps him amused for almost 10 minutes at a time!"
1,Too infantile for toddlers,"It might be fun for younger babies, but for my 18-mo-old, it was too infantile. (I've noticed the enthusiastic reviews on this product come from moms of babies under 1, although the recommended age by mfr. is 1+.)Not much different from what was on his old exersaucer. Yes, it does have the lego-style blocks, but he has a separate collection of those that are more sophisticated and to his liking. In addition, the height of the table is too low for him (he's 33"" tall) and he was awkwardly bending from the middle of the waist to play with it. In all, his interest lasted a few days, and then we gave it away to a younger neighbor."
3,Mom of Triplets,"My triplets got this toy for their first birthday. They immediately took the table part off and climbed into it. Individually they do the same. The table falls over easily when climbed. To be fair, it was not designed to be climbed into! Unfortunately, this is the ONLY activity my children have gotten out of this toy! No I'm wrong, they love throwing the blocks! They are now approaching their 2nd birthday and still the only thing that is appealing to them is climbing into it, or onto it. We have given up and it's now in my basement! If only there was a way to secure the top to the base, maybe my kids would have been more interested in the activities."
2,too late for my 1 year old!,"I think I missed the boat on this one; I bought it for xmas for my 13 month old and the only real play it gets is when my daughter and her 3 year old brother take off the ""play top"" and sit inside it! They think thats fun but thats about it."
3,Is it possible to find more blocks?,"We gave this to our daughter for her first birthday. I would recommend offering it to a child who is 8-10 months. The table would be great for a baby who is just pulling to a stand position. By the time our child received it, she was no longer interested in standing in one spot but instead wanted to toddle all over the place. She would have played more with it at a younger age. My main objection to this product is that I have not been able to find replacement blocks. Are there any available? The other brands, of course, don't fit. It comes with relatively few blocks, and we seem to lose one or two every day. If we had more blocks, both our daughter and our 3 year-old would enjoy playing with the buildong side of the table"
3,new parent,"We bought this toy for our 11-month-old daughter and she was engrossed with it immediately. A good thing. Within 10 minutes, she decided to climp atop the table. A bad thing. She seemed to forget about climbing on top of the table on the second day. On this day, she learned to lift the activity tray and climb into the basin. A bad thing. I certainly think this toy has a lot merit if you are able to supervise your child the whole time s/he plays with the table. I work from home and my daughter spends a lot of time in my office in a well-protected, child-proof toy area. However, because of the set up of the room, I have my back toward part of her section. I do not feel comfortable with this activity table in her toy area for fear she will climb atop it and fall when I do not happen to be looking. She's too small to understand she could topple off backward and have the table come tumbling after."
1,James Flannery: Master of the Fermata,"Do these songs have rhythm? You would never know listening to this disk. Flannery's voice seems overly pleased with its ability to hit pitch - so much so that he can't resist holding just about every note beyond its allotted time. Kudos to Janet Harbison for putting up with it long enough to finish the album. If you're looking for good Thomas Moore, seek out theInvocation recordings, which sadly have been discontinued by the manufacturer . If it's good Irish Blarney you're looking for, stick with McCormack - he at least could control his vibrato."
1,"A cheap , ugly production.",From a group that is recognised for their early innovative concert visuals I cannot believe the tawdry product they have served here. The visuals look like the were produced in the early 80's on a commodore-64 computer. Why the repeated images of the female musician on sax and other reed instruments when none are featured on the soundtrack? (granted she is easy on the eye compared to the other two heaps).Avoid.
5,Amazing Book,"I read this book in the book store, I couldn't put it down and bought it right after with tears still in my eyes. Thomas Kinkade is an extremely talented illustrator and the story is amazing. I read it in church as the message one week, it is just terrific!"
3,Biesemyer 78-934 Right Extension Table,"Table is constructed quite solid and perfectly plane. The only problem I have is they fail to mention it does not come with legs, hardware, instructions, etc. A bit pricey for a rectangular chunk of partical board overlain with a smooth formica like board."
5,Great video for the Intermediate Player,"Video covers masse and curve shots, plus shots covered in first video in greater detail. Also covered is draw, follow, stop, and stun-runthrough applied to cut shots.This is a great video, but DO NOT PAY $49.95 or whatever ridiculous price the seller is asking. This video can be found much cheaper on ebay or on any pool or billiards supply website. Don't pay more than $29.95"
1,It is a piece of trash!!!!!!,"I absolutely cannot believe this piece of crap was picked as one of the 100 best non fiction books of the century! It is not much better than porno---it is little more than evidence of the American obsesssion with sex and the obsession Star has had with Clinton since he entered the White House. What was described in that report was nobody's buisness. Those details are between the President, his family,and Moncia Lewinsky. They are not anything the American public needed to know."
1,valve stem rips where it meets the tube,I bought two of these. both failed within 5 minutes of putting them on and heading out to ride. had a lot of time to think about this review on the walk back home. wish I could give zero stars and remove some from others.
2,Valve stem too short!,"Just tried installing this on a fairly standard mountain bike rim. The valve stem is significantly shorter than the tube that came out of the wheel. It is also significantly shorter (by about a third of an inch) than an XLC branded thorn resistant tube I purchased for another bike.I purchased 4 of these tubes to fix 2 bikes. The stems were all the same length.Because of this, the stem does not stick out from the rim far enough to get an inflation valve head on it to inflate the tube.Other than that it seems sturdy enough and is on a par with other thorn resistant tubes I have purchased."
3,Too Heavy,"I bought these a while back and after installing went for a ride. Unfortunately they were too heavy & made it hard to ride so I had to remove them & go to a lighter, cheaper tube. But now I keep getting flats so I'm looking for a light but thicker tube than the real cheap ones. Don't want the hassle of liners, still looking for the perfect tube. But I'm sure these would prevent flats..."
3,"Baffling, strange, honest, and interesting.","It's been a while since i've read this book, so bear with me. Neil Hagerty has presented us with science fiction at its most confusing. Victory Chimp is our hero who takes us through time in a fight against Chon. The most interesting section of the book comes in the final segment, with the question and answer period. Hagerty uses wrestling as his metaphor here; he succeeds in doing so. This book may require a repeat read, but it is worth the effort. A very odd and enjoyable work. Recommended by this reader."
5,one of the most important coming of age stories,this story not only reconciles the poetry of william carlos williams and the journalistic style of joan didion it also outdoes steve erikson's tours of the black clock----------- by historical standards
2,"Too much padding, too many typos","While this book does provide a reasonable overview, I found it rather disappointing.It has too many errors. With highly technical material, it is imperative that the information is correct or else you can't trust it. For example a minus instead of a plus does not help when explaining terminology.Only half the book is really about fuzzy logic. There is far too much padding eg. 1.large diagrams showing Moore's Law and the layers in an IC gate. These are not subjects that should be covered in a book on fuzzy logic and one is forced to conclude that the author had a page quota to be reached and did it by adding these secions and large verbose reference sections.A worked example or an appendix showing an algorithm in C would have been far more useful."
5,Irrefutable,"The film makes the case and nails it shut. Why's it important for people to know? Well, for one thing, it would be nice to avoid a ""false flag"" nuclear attack on a U.S. city, which might be their next move.Why is truth-seeking so important? If enough Americans had been engaged in it earlier - with Pearl Harbor (of which FDR had prior knowledge), Waco, OKC, etc.- we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now.It amazes me that people can actually watch this film and deny what they see before their very eyes, such as Building 7 coming down in 6.5 seconds at 5:25 p.m. in the exact manner of a regular controlled demolition. (The 9/11 Commission didn't even mention Building 7 in its report.)"
5,Absolutely a must!,"This is an excellent, very educative, documentary on 9-11. Well researched and accurately presented material. If this movie does not affect your consciousness, you are in a hopeless denial."
3,About half way through the skeptics were uneasy,"I just watched this video last night with a group of people. The two skeptics in our crowd kept interupting with sarcasitc comments like, ""oh now are they going to blame UFO's? but then about half way into it, with the analysis of the clean fall of WTC7, even these guys were very suspicious.My only criticism is that some of the links tying coincidences together were long and drawn out so that the audience got bored several times. I think some quick sound bites covering some major points would have made a lasting impression."
5,Reality Check for a Nation at Risk,"This is the best documentary presentation to date that I have seen to present the facts which lead to a complete rejection of the findings of the ""9/11 Commission"" with regard to ""how"" or ""why"" the buildings at the World Trade Center in New York, collapsed on September 11, 2001. It needs to be shown on every campus and discussed endlessly until there is an international investigative body, as called for at a recent United Nations assembly meeting, made up of scientists, engineers and architects with international recognition and status in their respective disciplines, to provide a realistic explanation of the events most likely to explain and account for the tragic events of that day. I cannot wait for the rest of the series to come available!"
5,Great for Macs and PC's,"This is the full ""Grey"" cable set, not the less expensive PC-only ""black"" cable, with multiple serial connectors - thus the higher retail price. It works great on any PC or Mac with a serial port. On older Macs without a USB port, it's the only way to go. Great for labs or homes where both PC's and Macs are in use. Allows speedy downloads of programs to your calculator (check out ticalc dot org for lots of free software)."
3,plax,"Plax Anti - Plaque Dental Rinse, Original - 16 OzI used this product in the 1970's. It was a very good product. After 1/2 bottle, the plaque build-up from your teeth was gone. Now, after a whole bottle - nothing. It really does not taste like cinnamon, it is a little nasty tasting to me, but i have not found a good tasting mouthwash yet. Will save postage and go to walmart next time."
4,Great songs for any Partridge Family fan!,"I loved this album so much that I still have it after 31 years! I used to sing the songs from this album for anyone who cared to listen when I was a kid. ""Girl You make my day"" is a great song, and I especially love ""Hello Hello."" ""There'll come a time"" is also a good one, and ""Am I losing you."" If this is a lousy album like others are saying, then why is this one priced at close to $... when the others are selling for $... $...? The GReatest Hits album (with the house on the cover) is also great, as is all their albums! I collect memorabilia and the Greatest Hits album is hanging up on the wall in my house! I'm a true fan of David's!"
5,Partridge Family Re-mastered,The album re-mastered sounds great while still retaining the original vibe and feel of the music. The 70's never sounded clearer!
4,partridge family shopping bag,loved this cd especially Hello Hello and Every little bit of you have the 3 series of PF on DVD
3,This Shopping Bag could be loaded up with a few more hits,"If the albums by the Partridge Family are a cherished part of your childhood, then you have probably noticed how few really good songs on each of their albums album. On ""The Partridge Family Shopping Bag"" there are only two songs that made it on to their greatest hits collection, and ""Am I Losing You"" and ""It's One of Those Night"" are not exactly a couple of their best songs. It is ironic that you will find more decent songs on your standard Cowsills album (the family that unofficially inspired the television family faux band) than you will on the actual albums by the Partridges. I am all for reliving your childhood (when are the Smothers Brothers albums coming out on CD?) but when it comes to the music of the Partridge Family their greatest hits CD really does have everything decent David Cassidy ever did. ""The Partridge Family Shopping Bag"" is really one of their lesser collections."
1,Ugh!,"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear here is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off."
3,Leaving Him Behind,"If you are the person who initiated the divorce and you will have a lasting friendship with your ex, then this book isn't for you. We have a respectful relationship upon parting, I'm the breadwinner of the relationship, and neither of us are bitter about the divorce. I instead need to 'break the ties' that bind us to establish freedom to create my own future...essentially understand the progression from married to single. This book is more about the male being the breadwinner and the husband initiating the divorce."
1,Underwhelmed,"Scarcely an hour of grainy black & white clips, many of which are available in color and far better condition. Doesn't even fit together very well as a ""clip show"". $14.99 is a cruel joke, as it has the same quality as a dvd I'd purchase at a ""dollar store"", were their anything worthy to purchase there. No info included, looks like a home-burned dvd. Save your money."
4,Intrigue,Good read with enough intrigue and mystery to keep the reader interested. Contrast between pre and Post WWII Berlin portrayal is graphic. The life of Germans (both Aryan and Jewish) during the war is consistent with other views of this desparate time and all the more real because the book's characters personify dramatically different fates.
4,"The Good German, lengthy, convoluted, but valuable historial insight.","The book is lengthy and at times, needlessly detailed, although there is enough to help the reader feel the pathos. Overall it was a good read, especially useful in a historical sense."
5,Great read for beginning of post nazi germany politics,"Great read for behind the scenes of negotiating between the US and her allies and Russia,at the Potsdam Conference. Backdrop for the murder and intrigue as the primary story line of the book."
3,A 300 page screenplay,"Kanon has no pretensions to be a literary genius. He tells a good story, though, and this tale of mysterious-goings-on in post-war Berlin is educative and fast-moving, even if the ending is a little convenient and too delayed (perhaps the book should be shorter). It is written in that personal present-tense screen-play style which is not everyone's cup of tea. Still, the film is out there (a Clooney production) and the book is worth a read if you liked the film and probably vice-versa."
2,"I love George Jones, but this record is just plain sad","This album is one of the only, maybe *the* only George Jones record that just isn't worth owning. It's really terrible. Jones was sinking deep into his own private, self-destructive hell at the time, drinking, drugging and missing shows left and right. And, for once, he let it get to him in the studio as well. This is a slapdash, what-the-heck record, with covers of old rock songs like ""Roll Over, Beethoven,"" ""Maybelline,"" ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Kansas City,"" banged out in the studio with a heavy blues beat, and Jones and Paycheck swapping lines as the songs thunder past. Doubtless they had fun partying together, but the results weren't so great as far as the rest of us go. Sigh. On the other hand, it's all up from here! (Axton)"
2,"Could have been great, what a waste",What a waste of great talent. All this film needed was a bigger budget. The screenplay was mediocre at best. It was obviously shot on 16mm film. Looks like it was trying to be a Barbershop clone. There were some funny moments thats why I gave it 2 stars.
3,Not the greatest..,"I was actually excited to get this movie. I had ambitions that it was going to be a hysterical laugh from beginning to end. I was wrong. There are it's funny parts, it's sterotypical parts, and it's parts that get your heart to warm up. Although it has a good meaning and theme goin on, I got tired of it quickly. It's like a low budget film and something that should have been on Lifetime. All of the actors played their role well, (although I thought that Delicious was being overly dramatic and portraying homosexuals in an ill manner). Overall, I can't say I liked it nor disliked it. It was OK. I just learned not to have many high expectations of a movie based on it's lead actor."
1,It's DEFINITELY not BeautyShop...,"...so if that's what you're looking for, you won't get it here.I found this DVD in the $5 bin at Wal-mart and I'm mad I wasted $5 on it...movie was boring and I understand why it went straight to video."
1,Don't buy it!,This movie was absolutely horrible. Do not waste your money buying or even renting this movie.
5,THE GIRL'S TURN! OUR BEAUTYSHOP!,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!IT WAS FUNNY AND ALSO HEARTWARMING!CHECK IT OUT!IT IS NOT ALL LAUGHS!IT GETS DEEP!5 STAR MOVIE!BOBBY BROWN HELPED PRODUCE IT!IT WILL SURPRISE YOU!
4,HAIR,IT'S A GOOD MOVIE. I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE. I WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER PART 3. I WILL ORDER AGAIN
2,"Funny at times, but it went nowhere quick","This movie did have some really funny moments in it, and overall, I thought it was funnier then its predecessor, Barbershop. The acting was pretty solid, to. However, Barbershop had something from start to finish that this movie completely lacked, a plot. This story really went nowhere because there was a lack of a goal throughout it. And after I came to the end of it, I realized why this movie probably didn't get picked up for theatrical distribution, it felt really short! If the producers would have put as much effort into improving the script as they did with getting name brand people in it (stars) then it probably could have went somewhere. Oh well."
3,Family or whatever we are...................................,"Beauty shops are always so much more than they appear to be. Your fam is there, they know you and how to heal you. We all go in there to kick dirt, laugh, and in some instances to cry. This was a really great story, I think that it could have been a little better it didn't need all of the so called extras (LIL KIM, WHITNEY, or BOBBY BROWN) to help out maybe a stronger story line would have been sufficent. It however is a nice story."
2,Mediocre! 2.5 stars,"I think this film a great story but the writing wasn't thatinteresting to really pull it off. The director in the specialfeaturette says the idea to write it came from the fact thatBarbershop made a lot of money and felt that it was obvious aBeautyshop counterpart needed to be made. However, Barbershopwas not that great of a film to begin with in my opinion and you really can't compare this film with it. Notably this film wasn't really funny. Although I'm crazy about Jenifer Lewis (Nora), she's not given a good script to work with here. It's also nice to see Tatiyana Ali. I will say Nora's Hair Salonseemed to be on the right track but something is definitelyamiss. It needs more juice."
3,Could Have Been Better!,I thought that this movie was just.... Okaythere was nothing really special about it really.
4,IT WAS OKAY!!!!!,THIS MOVIE WAS O.K. BUT I THINK THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH MORE ACTION!!!!!!
4,Understandably Great!,I thought that this book would be a lot of technical jargon that I would not understand but O'Connell made the technical stuff simple and easy to follow. This book causes the reader to question what would really happen if someone trusted with secret information decided to use that information for their own personal gain. It makes you question your safety in a world that is growing in technology and nuclear war-fare. Women would enjoy this book because it also proves that women have a place in the air-force and can be just as brutal as men. Happy reading!
1,Blind pilots vs. Superwoman,"Well, this book is a good case for what an author shouldn't do to build depth and characters. Instead, this book is nothing more than Rambo in the air. It's one woman vs. some of the worst pilots the US can muster in the world, and they die in unnamed droves.Technical expertise (which is above average for the genre) cannot carry this book as the characters (the pages of the book have more depth) and action is pathetic at its best."
5,Fiction that may become all too real!,"The book is a nail-biter and jaw-tightener of the 1st order. Don't assume a happy ending. Another reviewer noticed the similarity of this book to Tom Clancy! Stolen nuclear bombs sounds like 'Broken Arrow' - is this greatest challenge the end of history or a new world order? The author's technical knowledge obviously came from his years as a USAF Officer, working with all types of aircraft. When's the next book coming out?"
1,Completely unbelievable,"In order for someone to buy into the plot of this book, several things must be true. 1 - The majority of US fighter pilots are incredibly inept. 2 - The majority of US fighter weapons are incredibly inaccurate. If you can ignore the spelling errors, as well as the improper use of terminology, and have absolutely nothing else to do, you may enjoy the book. I found that reading it was actually a chore, and that doesn't happen to me often. Don't bother. Cut the grass or get a root canal, but don't waste your time on this book."
2,"Interesting subject, poor book","I frankly had never heard of the awful race riot in Tulsa on May 31 and June 1, 1921. This account is slipshoddily written by a journalist, not by a historian. The book has no footnotes and no real bibliography. So much of the account is devoted to guessing and while the book is rightly sympathetic to the black victims the account often lapses into juvenilistic maudlin journalism. The story is important, the event is full of horrific atrocities by white people, but the telling is not done well. Instead of expatiating on how awful things were I would far rather the author had laid out the facts, complete with footnotes. ...I simply have no faith that this account is objective and accurate. Sorry. I see there are other books dealing with the event..."
1,Not What I Expected,"When I bought this book, I expected to learn how to draw supports & resistances, and hopefully it'll include trenlines & channels.I didn't get to learn that. There is also a basic tenet of this book that i cannot agree with. It tells readers that supports & resistances are not functions of supply and demand. It may not be in the economic terms but my view is that S&R; are the results of supply and demand of the stock at the given prices.What you'll find in this book are the basic definations for S&R;, plus some explainations. You'll get the same for channels, gaps and the various triangle chart patterns. Swing trading is briefly touched upon, as well the dow theory.I dont find this book telling me much about S&R; that I don't already know. It is not a book for advanced traders. I don't think it is useful for beginners as well, any book that talks about technical analysis in general should be able to provide better details and explainations on everything this book touched on."
2,Not Jeffery's best,Really enjoy Jeffery Osborne's talent. (have seen him in person twice) but his xmas album is just OK.I was disappointed.
5,Smooth tunes for the holidays!,"If you are a fan of Jeffrey Osborne and even if you aren't, this is the BEST holiday CD. His voice is so smooth and you can't help but make it part of your holiday CD collection. He hasn't changed and still has the best sound that's slightly R&B but also just ""good listening"" for everyone. I highly recommend this CD. Have I convinced you?"
5,Beautiful & Soulful Christmas Cheer,"Osborne shares the gift of his voice on this well crafted Christmas collection. His vocals are strong, soulful and articulate and every song expresses a distinct lyrical and vocal beauty which will quickly warm your heart and soul.This collection gets you in the spirit of the season from track one, Christmas Time is Here. Another one of the highlights is an Osborne original called Just A Little Snow. Osborne's articulate lyrics on this track create a vivid imagery which quickly elevates your mood and spirit to the holiday season.This is beautiful, relaxing Christmas music to enjoy with your loved ones by the fireside, during dinner, or snuggled with your spouse or lover."
3,Tasty but not too filling,"Snackin' With the Manatees is the perfect title for this wild romp, part tribute to the surfing' sounds popularized by the Ventures and Dick Dale and part gonzo paean to the spirit of garage bands everywhere.The only vocals are some sporadic intros through a megaphone. This CD is all about guitars, lots of guitars, played with spirit and backed by a rhythm section that holds the whole thing together.There is not a lot of subtly or ton of variation here, and it's hard to listen to more than a few tracks consecutively without a break. But a few tracks here and there do make a great snack, not too filling but tasty."
4,10Years and still going!,"I have owned this model saw for over ten years and it is still going strong. It has taken me through two home renovations and three commercial renovations.IMHO, the key to having this particular saw perform very well are two things.First, get rid of the 10"" blade. It is too large for this size of saw. Replace it with a high quality 8"" carbide blade. You will immediately see a major performance difference.Second, take the time to set up the fence properly so that it is parallel with the blade. Do this once and use some lock-tight on the two upper securing bolts of the fence, and it will always be parallel if you don't throw the fence around like it is indestructible.Having made the two changes above and I can get very accurate (at least .05"") repeat cuts every time.Overall, it's a pretty durable unit if you take care of it like any respectable tool should be."
4,not the best compilation,"I would rated it with 5 if it should brought the original version of mi novia se cayo a un pozo ciego. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs are south america, I grew up with their music and vibe and dancing to them until early morning,just the way we like it in Chile and answering to some ignorant that review this cd before : they were not educated by or in this country!."
5,Another Great Amazon Purchase,"Over a period of several weeks, I attempted to find this product at a variety of stores: Home Depot, Lowe's, True Value, Fleet Farm, Do It Best Hardware, etc. No one had it. Then, I discovered that I could find and order it on Amazon in 60 seconds flat. Amazing! This is just one of a number of items that I have purchased for semi-obsolete products (in this case, a Troy-Bilt chipper manufactured in 1982). It is exactly what I wanted and needed, and was shipped immediately after I placed the order."
2,difficult to match cds to textbooks,"I would recommend just buying the whole set together. When broken up, its very easy to not understand if you even have the right versions of cds to go with particular editions."
3,"Not entirely what was expected, but useful none the less.","I expected more coverage in the vein of how to approach the interaction between men and women on boats. It did have that, but more than half the book was a primer for sailing aimed a women. While I can see that as being very useful, I was more interested in the interaction aspects."
4,Very useful,Nice way to check your teeth. Be careful not to let the mirror get smudged. It isn't a glass mirror that you can clean. The light is a definite asset for getting a clear look.
5,Great book,Our grandson just loves it. He could hardly wait to get back to it while opening his other Christmas presents on Christmas day.
2,Not complete by a long shot,"This is not a bad CD but it is not great either. The most glaring omission is Springfield's ""Son of a Preacher Man"". The sound is standard so there are no glaring flaws though it could be argued that it should have been enhanced from the analog stream.I think for the few extra dollars if you do not want to shell out for the 3 CD Boxset is to get the Very Best of Dusty which has 20+ tracks and is more representative of her work."
2,Poor remastering,"Very poor sound quality. For example, if you compare Stay Awhile & I Only Want To Be With You on this recording to the originals on the album: ""Stay Awhile--I Only Want To Be With You"" or the album: ""OOOOEEEEE!"" you will find that these are muddy renditions with the highs muffled and the very life of the songs squashed. I have several different CDs of many of the songs and I know."
3,LOUSY SOUND QUALITY,"While I have no problem with the selection of songs (it contains all her great hits from Philips), I can't believe that this was remastered at all judging from the lousy sound quality. With the technology out there today, they should be ashamed to even put this out.I give it 3 stars only because it's better than nothing."
4,A Good Album That Gets Your Feet Wet Into the World of Dusty,"20th Century Masters is a great, inexpensive collection that does a good job of showcasing an artist's talent. To me, this cd shows her earlier important hits like You Don't Have to Say you Love, I Only Want To Be With You, Wishin' and Hopin', The Look of Love, and some lesser explored gems: All I See Is You, Losing You, and What's It Gonna Be. These 12 tracks are essential to any DS collection, but be sure you don't limit yourself to them either."
1,Just awful,"I've yet to find a truly tasty low carb cereal. At best these are tasteless and overly hard (too crunchy and dry).They smell a bit like sawdust and probably taste no better.I love that they are loaded with protein, unfortunately I found them barely edible."
4,Riviting account of a pointless endeavor,The folly of life threatening mountain climbing struck me as never before. Why squander resources on such a thing? Even worse is the fact that the native culture in near by areas is being devastated by rich people enticing poor people to get them to the top of the mountain. Why not spend all the treasure and committment on something worthwhile!
4,"Rough around the edges, but I couldn't put it down!","Having known little about climbing, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Krakauer presented a story, often relying on technical aspects, in a lucid manner. This book is a quick and exciting read. Much better than the made for TV show. As long as you overlook a few typos and grammatical errors the book reads well. I will say that the book did not answer all of the questions that arose as I read, but I am not sure there are any answers."
3,There's more to the story!,"I was fascinated by this story. Jon Krakauer wrote a vey interesting tale. When I discussed this book with someone else, she told me that I HAD to read The Climb (written by Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston DeWalt). This book is co-written by the Russian guide who was on the mountain working as a guide in Scott Fischer's group. Mr. Krakauer leads the reader to believe that Boukreev left the group to save himself, only to later emerge and singlehandedly save a number of people. Even though, Into Thin Air, is fascinating there are a number of FACTS that Mr. Krakauer leaves out (that have been substantiated by other people on the mountain and in Mountain Madness) that tell the whole story. Anatoli Boukreev is a true hero and it infuriates me that he isn't portrayed that way. If you liked Into Thin Air (don't get me wrong it was a great book) please read The Climb to get a complete picture of what happened."
3,Sometimes the mountain wins.,"Jon Krakauer shouldn't blame himself for the tragedy on Everest. He is only one man. All his effort and all his strength-if he had any left-couldn't have saved those people. I hope that he will in time, be able to put it all behind him. As for the book, I felt it jumped back and forth in time too much. I like a book to get to the point and stay there. This book doesn't do that. Krakauer speaks of historical accounts quite often and interjects them between his own account. I find this book difficult to follow at times, for that reason. That does not, however, diminish the story in any way, regarding the tragedy. All who were involved are heros."
5,An absolute page turner,"This book by jon is just cool. Being a college stud, I don't find much time to read books out of my regulars, but after buying this book, I couldn't just stop reading it till the end, I hope Jon would produce more good books such as this one. Just awesome, good job Jon."
1,The kindle version is an out-and-out fraud,"An out-and-out fraud. The kindle version of this book contains missing sentences every 500 words or so. In effect, the kindle version of this book is not this book, which I first read on paper.Suppose Amazon shipped you a paper copy of Into Thin Air that was redacted like a classified document released under the Freedom of Information Act. That is effectively what this kindle book is.Yes, I know it's the publisher's fault. But I have no recourse with Amazon to return an e-book that they must know is as defective as a car that breaks down every few miles. For shame, Amazon, Don't buy it."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!!,Great book! I knew the basics about the accident but that may have made the book better. I learned a lot from the book.
3,Into Thourough Air,"Well, this book was very funny, happy, sad, etc., but it was a little too thourough maybe. Hey, I'm only 13 so you know how it is for me, and sometimes I thought it was only right to explain in lots of detail, but it makes the book drag a little bit and you start to wonder when the chapter is going to end. It also got me a little confused with the chapters, how the first chapter was about him at the, well, you'll find out, and the next chapter was basically the beginning, well, it confused me! Even so, I thought it was a good book. I give it 3 stars."
1,Readers From Santa Monica High School,"Into Thin Air is about a man who climbed Mount Everest and he writes about his story of what happend on the mountain. Our opinion of Into Thin Air is that we didn't like it. We thought it moved too slowly,and the author went on and on . He also spent to much time describing things.It was boring. The author sounded like a magazine, because he was so factual. We wouldn't want to read it again.(We had to read it for summer reading)Christina + Francis, Santa Monica High School"
2,Out of Thin Air,"This is the type of book where you can't wait until the wheels start spinning, problem was the wheels don't start to spin until the final three chapters. I was VERY disappointed with this ""masterpiece"". Not only was it too detailed, but it seemed like the author just wrote words for the sake of proloning the book. Don't get me wrong during the end it does get a little better, but absolutely not worth the first two hundred and some odd pages it takes to get there. My recommendation is this: unless you're the hiker/climber type, I wouldn't waste your time."
3,Diaster On Top Of The World,"I gave the book three stars. Because it took so long to get into, you would almost give up on reading it, because he tells you so much about the history of the mountain and past expeditions. After about the first 200 pages things really start to heat up. It isn't until the end of the book where the best part is. If you can indure all the information and stories to get to the heart of the book, then I would recommend it."
3,Too much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have never read a book quite like this one before! Every chapter was a different time in the past that he would compare his journey to. It was all very confusing when the date and place would change every time like that. To me it was very dull, because about the same information was presented in every chapter. Though, there was a lot of information that was very interesting to know."
3,decent book,"This is a decent book about the diaster on Mount Everest. Krakauer has written a better book in 'Into the wilderness'. i would recommend that book over this one, unless you just want to read about people dieing on a mountain and their struggles before this happens."
1,exciting storytelling but dishonest,"Krakauer tells an exciting story, well-written and captivating. But what is for real and what is fanciful writing? The lack of truth and credibility took away from my enjoyment of the book. This book caused so much outrage that Anatoli Boukreev and others who were involved in this disaster later wrote their own books to get the story straight. Krakauer makes assumptions and implicates people as at fault, mainly to have a good protaganist in the story. Its disturbing that this book has won so much acclaim. Exaggeration is one thing, but ripping apart people who risked their lives to save others isn't meritted. Krakauer certainly wasn't out there rescuing people."
1,"Entertaining, but...","Krakauers account of the 1996 Everest disaster is a one sided, egotistical tirade. While his writing style is easy and fluid, it is the underlying tone of Krakauers story that I found offensive. Too be sure, I could not put the book down as Krakauer is an expert weaver of tales, but upon reflection, the book was nothing more then one mans attempt to assign blame for the events on Everest in May 1996. Read the book, but realize all the time that there are two sides to every story. ""The Climb"" by the now deceased Anatoli Boukereev is the rebuttal to Krakauers ""In to Thin Air"". Read back to back, you are assured of many entertaining hours."
1,readers of outside magazine alert!!,"If you have read Krakauer's account of the disaster in OutsideMagazine, then you have no need to read this book. Have we, OutsideMagazine Readers, heard enough of this or what? How much more can we stand? How much more squabbling over what actually happened between the people that were up there can we take? Enough is Enough. Buy the magazine-it's cheaper."
4,Into Thin Air,The book Into Thin air was very good. I enjoyed reading about the real life account of Jon Krakauer. I disliked the part were he stated facts about Mount Everest. Some of the facts were intresting but after reading a few pages it got boring. After that I highly enjoyed reading it. The Book was very action filled. It contained a great real life experience about a climb to the top of Mount Everest. I didn't know much about mountain climbing untill I read the book. His acounts of climbing down the mountain contain great detail and are very intresting. My favorite part was the very begining when he was talking about his first account at the top of the Mountain. I would recommend this book to anyone. Its tough reading but very exciting and fun to read.
5,GRIPPING,"Could not put this book down! The book keeps you on the edge of your seat, yet is very educational as well. Jon Krakauer places notations throughout the book explaining details of the region, the people, and the mountain. Recommend this book highly!"
4,good book,"This is a good book that can show individuals the importance of leadership and direction. However, without reading the response by Bookreev, you will never get the whole story..."
5,Wonderful account on the everest disaster,"Among many books written on the Everest disaster that I have read, Into Thin Air gave us a much more interesting account of what really happen. Jon is a superb writer. If you like this book, I recommend you to go get his Into the Wild."
3,An Interesting And Sad Read,Into Thin Air is both interesting and sad. I learned a great deal about the world of mountain climbing . The story of this event is a tragedy. I was troubled by the actions of some of the expeditions. I would recommend this book.
2,I can't believe my eyes,"I can not believe what I am reading. All of the reviews written here, besides the one from the reader from New Hampshire, all glorify the deaths of these climbers. None of you seem to realize that this really did happen and lives were lost. This was not a movie where anything can happen and the actor walks away at the end. Krakauer should be ashamed of himself, writing a glorified and ""Hollywood"" account of one of the worst expedition experiences in recent memory. The only reason for two stars is because Krakauer survived and maybe one person will get the true picture of the story. Amateurs do not belong on Everest."
2,Okay but wanders a bit,"Pretty quick read with some good logistical details. Yet not thrilled at the author's blaming of everyone involved, logistics, and culture rather than a bad storm on the mountain. I know its a book and all, but the Sherpa's carry a good line throughout about angering the mountain while the author tends to focus too harshly on those who survived and comes off a bit harsh. It was a really good story until the author meandered into investigative journalism mode."
3,Putting faces to the names,"There were so many people on Everest in 1996 that it helps make sense of it all to be able to put a personality and a face to some of the names mentioned in the book. The David Breashears movie, ""Frontline: Storm Over Everest,"" available on Netflix, has extended interviews with Beck Weathers, Mike Groom, Helen Wilton, Lou Kasischke, Neal Beidleman, Sandy Hill (Pittman), Charlotte Fox, Lene Gammelgaard, Makalu Gau Ming-Ho, and several of the Sherpa guides."
5,Excellent book!,Super fast shipping from Amazon. I am grateful as this was a last minute birthday gift...which he LOVES! Says it's one of the best books he's ever read. Thanks for your prompt attention to expediting orders. I am a repeat customer because I know I can always count on fast processing and shipping.
5,Very satisfied,The product arrived swiftly and as described. Nothing was wrong with the product upon delivery. An excellent source for ordering books.
3,Reader needs to slow down,"I enjoyed the actual book much more than the audiobook, mainly because Krakauer reads the text so fast that he takes a lot of the emotion out of the story."
3,Required reading for HS,required reading for High school 11th grader. it was ok reading for her. a Necessary evil of public school requirements.
5,Well-written,"Into Thin Air is a gripping and, at times, harrowing account of the Everest disaster of 1996. As a non-climber, it gave me a fascinating insight to the psyche of those who knowingly take huge risks in the pursuit of something seemingly intangible. It really brought home to me the human cost that these expeditions can sometimes incur, and at times reads as though the author is trying to rid himself of the demons of having been there and survived.Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads."
2,slow start,The book was in okay shape; it's not as if I need a book in perfect condition to read. Really good turn around time at purchase.The book itself is decent if your into alot of geographical names and alot of informative facts.
3,"If you read this book, read ""The Climb"" as well","There is no doubt that this is a gripping, engrossing tale of the 1996 tragedy on Mt. Everest. This is the book that started my odyssey as an ""armchair"" Himalayan adventurer. I've read most of the books available on mountaineering and climing 8,000 meter mountains. However, the more I've read, the more I've wondered about the conclusions that Krakauer drew in his book. I just finished ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev, and while it tells much of the same story, it provides it from the guide's perspective. It was easy for Krakauer to vilify Boukreev, since he (Krakauer) was a mountaineering neophyte and a paying client on the mountain. But reading Boukreev's book provides balance to the story and answers a lot of the questions left unanswered by ""Into Thin Air."""
2,I think the author is too self-serving and biased,"I was looking forward to reading Into Thin Air, I love mountaineering and Mt. Everest, and the life & death struggles that come with it, and nothing like sad tragedy to make me feel...alive and thankful.I read this book in 2 days, but went from enthralled with the mountain drama to disappointed with Mr. Krakauer's growingly evident biases.I wish he could have been more objective, and less self-serving.Once I sensed his own selfishness coming through the accounts of this journey, the book and his writing turned me off, completely."
2,......I would have put it down after page 5.,"I give ""Into Thin Air"" two stars because it was a decent story, but seemed to drag on and on. If I would not have been required to read it for English class, I would have put it down after page 5. The first 200 or so pages are all about what happened up to the summit, from the plane ride across the ocean to what equipment they have at base camp. The last 178 pages cover who dies, how they die, what the bodies look like when they're found, and who was probably going to die next. The whole book was depressing. I knew from the beginning that I was forever discouraged from climbing Everest. It makes me wonder about the sanity of those who do try it."
5,Remarkable. Engrossing,"An enduring work, still fascinating and heart rending 15+ years later. Allows the reader to experience the climb, the history, and the heartbreak of Everest."
5,Realistic account of mountain climbing.,"I was planning to climb Mount Hood, but now I'm having secondthoughts. Mountain climbing appears to be much more drudgery thanelation. I admire mountain climbers, but I don't think I want to be one. I enjoyed the book thoroughly, and recommend it highly."
3,Questionable Motives,"There is no doubt that Krakauer's account of the Everest expidition is a very good read. The book is skillfully woven with history, fact and drama, told in high style. My questions concern the stated motives for writing this book. If it was because Krakauer is haunted by the experience, his guilt must be overwhelming for him to focus so much energy on trying to find fault with a guide who was not even on his team (Boukreev), and who did not allow any of his clients to perish. Scott Fischer's choices were his own, as were Rob Hall's. Boukreev was an honest man with high integrity, who remained gracious throughout Krakauer's finger-pointing. Perhaps if Krakauer's own team were not so focused on the outcome of his journalism, their decisions would have been different, and others would have lived. If you want facts, read ""The Climb."""
5,A sobering tale of adventure and hubris,"Do yourself a favor: buy this book, you won't regret it. There is an incredible sense of dread and foreboding that permeates this work due to the eventual outcome of the mission being so well-known to the reader from the outset of the story. I was struck by both the realistic descriptions of the author's fellow climbers, and the stunningly harsh environment they all found themselves in. Even weeks after reading it, I find myself pondering what it must have been like during those last lonely hours for those souls who didn't make it off the mountain: I am haunted by their sense of isolation, fear, and eventual resignation as death descended upon them at the top of the world..."
3,Good but...,"Interesting account of a major trajedy on Everest. While it's very intriguing and well-paced early on, ironically, it becomes tedious and dry towards the end as all the action unfolds. Still a good read, but it went from 5 star to 3 star over the last 75 pages."
5,Fantastic - smooth read about a whole different world.,"An awesome combination of the drama of the climb and the technical details of mountaneering that most people never come across. I am not a huge reader, but this one is worth it (sorry for sounding like an advertisement)."
3,"Though the plot was good, something was missing.","In the novel ""Into Thin Air"", Jon Krakauer recounts his experiance in the Mount Everest disaster of 1996. He gives an eyewitness account of the tragedies and triumphs that occured on the great mountain's unforgiving slopes. Though Krakauer does a good job telling the tale, I felt that something was missing. It almost seems like he missed the point of his own book. It seemed like he was trying to make amends to the families of the deceased for the discrepancies in the article he wrote for Outside Magazine. Instead, I felt that he spent more time pointing fingers at everyone (himself included). Even so, the book was very readable. I think the book teaches you a little something about the value of life and trust."
4,Exciting Read....,"This is a great, easy read. Finished it in 2 days. I highly recommend reading it and then getting out to see the IMAX film, which was filmed right after the disaster. My only problem with his writing. There are too many names to keep track of, and on one page he refers to someone by their first name, the next page he refers to the same person by their last name. Very confusing to keep track of who is who. Overall, I think it is a must read for anyone who loves the outdoors."
4,A look into the souls of thrill seekers,"As previously stated, not the best wriiten, but immensely interesting. Why people attempt to live on the edge is a fascinating subject. The end of the book/climb is worth waiting for."
5,A truly moving yet totally thrilling read,"I don't need to tell you the scenario as all the other reviews do that. But let me just say if you want to be excited, appalled, thrilled, saddened and in total wonderment read this incredibly written book.I loved it and at last I know why people climb mountains and why I never will."
4,This is exciting and riviting book.,"I think this is a great book. It involves real-life and survival, at a place I can only dream of going to."
3,"A Good Story, But Not Great","Krakauer wrote this book too quickly with many regrets. Urgent deadlines dramatically hindered a polished product. If you have read his other books who would know that there were many passages inserted from his previous writings about mountaineering. It was a good book, but not great. His best work by far was ""Into the Wild."" I give it 5 stars with a ""must read"" status. If you enjoyed ""Into Thin Air"" I highly recommend Joe Simpson's ""Touching the Void."" This book about a mountaineering tragedy is without a doubt 5 stars."
3,We really enjoyed the beginning of this great novel.,"Into Thin Air was a great example on how to follow your dreams. Each of the climbers seem to show great dedication and motivation when climbing Mount Everest. Even though they went through many struggles, in the end they were happy dying."
3,"The beginning was boring, but the rest was very good!","We enjoyed this book for the most part. The beginning was a little too boring for us. We didn't like how Jon Krakauer went on and on about things that didn't seem very important to us. But those facts helped us out later in the book. Those boring facts helped us have a better understanding of the book later on. The fact that he keep going on and on about equiptment and sherpas wasn't too exciting to us, but we like the middle and on because it got exciting. It got really exciting when one of the memebers of the team was left to die. Then came back alive with frostbite!"
5,"FANTASTIC, (& TRUE) of an Everest 1996 tragedy for 2 teams.","It sets a fantastic standard by which other ""based-on-rea-lifel"" events (especially because of the tragedies involved) should follow. It provides enough motivation to spark interest in the topic (for books & movies). (The only current downside is that NOTHING else has met the same standard yet!)"
5,Fascinating read!,This is a harrowing tale that will give you chills even if you never go mountaineering. I loved this and couldn't put it down. I've read most of his books. An excellent writer. A must read book for anyone who likes suspense.
4,Into Thin Air,"Loved the book when I bought it in paperback, but loaned to a friend of a friend and never got it back! Loved that there was a logical sequence and that Jon Krakauer seemed fair about his role in the debacle and was also critical of events and people who contributed. There are always a myriad of opinions, Jon stated his. Well written and passionate. Recommended definitely"
4,Didactic yet gripping,Just the facts. Krakauer was there and yet he sticks to a very fact oriented format. The true story is better than fiction and despite the dryness of the writing the tale is unbelievably gripping. I read it in one night and immediately went to buy his other books.
5,"A fascinating, thorough and honest account of the disaster.","This book was even more interesting than I expected. The author's descriptions of the various participants and background on Mt. Everest expeditions really make the story hit home. Considering the horrific force of the storm that hit and the incredibly depleted condition the author was in, it's bizarre that some have had the nerve to criticize Mr. Krakauer. To have expected him go out in his condition and in that storm to save other climbers in the condition they were in is like expecting a woman in the advanced stages of labor to rescue people from a burning building."
5,Who has the right to judge?,"This is an extraordinary book. I know nothing about mountaineering, and yet had no problem understanding what was going on, or keeping the sequence of events straight. I can't understand why people feel they have the right to judge Krakauer. Probably none of us has ever been in such a dire, horrible situation. To say that we would have acted more heroically is pure speculation. Personally, I don't blame anyone who acted first to save themselves. Also, I think Krakauer went easy on some of the bozos who were up on that mountain. It was obvious to me as a reader that it was not easy for him to criticize the climbers."
4,Climb It,"INTO THIN AIR, by Jon Krakaur the author of INTO THE WILD. Ever wonder what it would be like to ascend the tallest mountain in the world. In this book you feel like your up there with them. Climbing the mountain with twelve others, he encounters many challenges. In the book, you also learn the lifestyles and past of many other climbers on the team. This would be a great book to read if you like the outdoors and enjoy reading. It's a rather long book but you'll find yourself done reading quickly as you never want to put the book down. In this book, there are so many details that you might miss some in the first read. After reading, INTO THIN AIR I guarantee you will think differently about mountain climbing. I would recommend purchasing this book."
4,Top Class Journalism,"I can not comment on the morality or otherwise of the dramatic personae. This is a harrowing and realistic account of the tragic 1996 events. The book was written by an experienced journalist and mountaineer who captured this most dramatic of stories first hand. He has succeeded most vividly in providing an accurate and fair account. His journalistic ability ensures that almost every angle to the story is looked at. Krakauer only just lived to tell the tale, and as an experienced mountaineer did enough to ensure his own survival. He has produced one of the best books on mountaineering I have read. It is a sad tale, but those who took part should have known the risks. It is sadder to think about the death of guides who sacrificed their lives in order to try and get their clients to the top and down."
5,Greed and fame to misfortune and death.,"Krakauer's account of the 1996 disaster is brutally honest. Chilled and numb, just like the climbers stranded on Everest, you left after learning about horrendous mistakes made by veteran guides atop Everest. Krakauer recalls the horrify events in detail, and reduces the tail into our instinct to survive. You will find yourself challenging the leadership of Hall and Fischer and cheering for the improbable survival of Beidlemen. This book will make you think twice about the next risk you take."
4,Awesome story of one of this decade's biggest tragedies.....,"I first read this book last summer and recently read it again. I was surprised by how many of its subtleties I missed the first time! I have been to the Himalayas, the Annapurnas and Kathmandu. Krakauer's book *Into Thin Air* is an accurate description of what it is really like over there. I did not climb in the Everest region, but I know from stories our Sherpas told who had been there that it is definitely not for people with little mountaineering expertise. Just being rich doesn't increase the rate of survival! Even the experts can fail! Krakauer has been criticized for his work on this book, but I truly enjoyed reading it and it was gut-wrenching at times, to say the least. There are books written by others who were associated with that particular climb and they each lend a slightly different slant. But Krakauer does write this book in a style that even people who aren't expert mountain climbers can understand and appreciate."
5,Took my breath away...,"Seriously, this book gave me a new appreciation for anyone who attempts this feat...climbing Everest. The author does such a great job describing how much is really involved with it that I almost felt like I was there...from the moment he sees Mt. Everest from the window of his plane. Incredible story. After I read the book I rented the IMAX DVD and watched it and I felt like I knew the characters. What really got to me was some of the extras on the IMAX DVD, especially a one-on-one interview with the doctor who had been left for dead (inadvertently) twice by the other climbers, yet survived and the whole story in his own words. Some people are true heroes and I bow down to them..."
5,A great read that will literally take your breath away!,"The mark of a good book is that even though you know whathappened, you enjoy it anyway.For me it was especially gripping as Ihave a fear of heights and cannot imagine how determined, skilled and fearless these climbers must be.How must it feel to be cruising at 29,000 feet in an airplane and look out the window to the summit of Everest and think that you will be on the roof of the world if you can get to the top. I think Mr.Krakauer's story is an honest account and represents his way of coming to terms with what happened on the mountain.The only drawback for me was that not enough of the other climbers characters.were fully drawn. I would have liked to better understand what makes people want to put themselves in this life or death situation.I 'm ready for the IMAX movie."
5,Suspense at its best,"Since we already know the outcome of this disastrous adventure,getting there becomes the absorbing aspect of the book. Reading aboutthe characters play out the inevitable is both wrenching and compelling. He brings the reader along, and I felt exhausted by the end. As a sedentary person, my eyes were opened to the extremes some people are willing to go to for a thrilling adventure. Krakaur seems sincere in his desire to purge himself of survivor's guilt."
4,"As it says in the title, it is a ""personal account"".","Krakauer's book is by all means fascinating. Far from being a literary masterpiece (his writing skills surely do not deserve a Nobel prize), it manages to trigger the fear associated with high-altitude climbing. Rather than comparing the characters' heroics (or lack thereof), the reader should focus on the description of effort and hardship of all of the expeditioneers who were present during those fateful days of May '96. I will read Anatoli Boukreev's book next, in order to gain more insight into the tragedy that captivated so many. In hope of not sounding too redundant, it would be senseless to view this book as a finger-pointing rampage. Krakauer actually praises Boukreev's [valiant] efforts during the crisis. As for us, the readers, please keep in mind that we have no place for judging ANYONE, anyhow."
5,Soul searching and morally complicated,"This book kept me awake for nights even after I finished reading it. Before reading this book I wrote the members of this Everest team off as thrill seeking morons who could buy their way to the top of the world. Now, I admire every person, especially those who survived for dealing with their memories. This book was wonderfully written and at times very upsetting. A must read."
4,Into Thin Air,"I read this book some time ago, but haven't written a review. The book was very interesting. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, the writer, Jon Krakauer, was very critical about the actions of Anatoli Boukreev. Boukreev was actually a hero on the mountain while Krakauer was too out of it to give any help. Krakauer even gave information to Fisher's wife making her believe that he was alive.While Krakauer did a good job at writing the book, he was self-serving in making it look like what he did was Ok and Boukreev should be blamed for some of the deaths. One thing that most people didn't realize is that Krakauer and Boukreev were on different teams and none of the climbers from Boukreev's team, with the exception of their leader, died on that climb."
5,This book was awesome,They must first acclimize themselves then make the ill fated summit push which is not always succesful
5,I'm ready for the summit!,"A GREAT book for anyone, especially armchair adventurers. This book takes the reader to Mt. Everest where the author introduces you to the mountain and those who wish to top it. Written in a style that allows you to be a part of the climbing team, this book is a non-stop page turner. Start reading and head for the top!"
3,"An interesting story, but disjointed.","The story itself of Into Thin Air, is what kept my interest. However, it is told in a very disorganized and disjointed fashion. I wanted more detail about the actual details of this tragedy, and less about previous expeditions and various personalities."
4,about in to thin air,I found the book very interesting and fun I read the whole book without getting bored of it I think it was the best book I have ever read.
4,"A well-written, vivid look at a very serious topic.","Into Thin Air takes an up-front look at the perils one faces by climbing Everest. Author Jon Krakauer, a frequent contributor to renowned magazines such as Outside, Rolling Stone and yes, Playboy, was only taking the journey up the mountain for an article, but it turned out to be one of the saddest, and unforgettable times of his life. Just as he got to know his companions, the storm took nearly all of them.This book is so well written -- I can't believe Krakauer has such vivid memories of it all. You don't need to be a wilderness buff to enjoy this book, I would recommend it to just about anybody who enjoys good literature. Into Thin Air also taught me a very important lesson -- I'm never going to climb Mount Everest."
5,Gripping and Addicting,"Krakauer tells a true to life tale of the 1996 Mt Everest disaster. The story is almost too gripping to be real. Krakauer writes with a scary authenticity that makes you unaware of his presense in the book as writer. The book THE CLIMB is a good read that tells another's side of the Everest accident, but Krakauer's is by far the best."
4,"Surprisingly interesting, moving, engaging","Knowing nothing about Everest or mountain climbing in general, I approached this book with a great deal trepidation, but ended up enjoying the second half. I expected this book to be dry and boring, and the first 150 pages are. However, once Krakauer and his team start their summit run, Into Thin Air becomes an exciting, engaging read.The events related in this book are shocking and horrifying, especially when you consider that they really happened. Krakauer tells with feeling of the deaths of his team members and the haziness of his mind as he approached the 29,028 foot summit of Mt. Everest. The end of this book is excrutiating, and leaves you with a deep understanding of how much the climbers' lives must have changed since the incident. While not one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read, I feel it would be worthwhile reading for anyone, not just mountain climbing experts, as long as you can get through the first 150 pages."
5,My two cents,"With nearly 1600 reviews at an average rating of 4.5 stars, nothing I have to say will really sway you to read this book or not. That said, after reading this book I feel compelled to share my two cents with the world, although I'm not sure why. I think it's because this book was just that good.Having never climbed a mountain, I have developed a strong two part opinion about climbing Mt. Everest...People should not climb Mt. Everest. Plain and simple. There will always be those who feel like they must achieve the un-achievable. To them I say go ahead and climb it, but, climb it alone. No sherpas, no guides, no team, no partner...ALONE. Then you only have yourself to blame when things go terribly wrong.If anyone with a larger understanding of high elevation climbing were to assess this opinion, I'm sure they would point out that it would be impossible to climb this mountain alone. If you can't climb it alone - you shouldn't climb it!Great book!"
5,"A fitting memorial, Linda Barron (wava@iafrica.com)","I climbed the mountain with the author, all in three days, not with oxygen but with copious quanties of coffee to stay awake because I wanted to get to the end. At times, especialy towards the end, it became somewhat self indulgent, but if you are going to say sorry, what a better way than to write a bestseller. The author has still to conquer his personal Everest. He did it once before, I have no doubt he will do it again. For those left behind on the mountain, the book is a fitting and honest memorial - I am sure they approve! For me living on a continent and in a country (South Africa) where we are confronted each day with such harsh realities as death, racism, disease, poverty, fear and corruption, the book gives me encouragement to not lose hold of the dream of a better life for all, albeit that the cost could be personally expensive."
5,A riveting story of human struggle and tragedy on Everest,"A wonderful read. Once you start it's very hard to put down. Jon describes in vivid details the struggle of various different personalitys and egos in their attempt to conquer Mount Everest and achieve there own personal goals. The author attempts to be blatantly honest about his and others behaviour in the tragedy that unfolds in the ""death zone"" at the apex of the world. This reveting account provides insight into man's struggle with the elements, his own ambition and sanity on the frozen oxygen depleted slopes of the Himalayas."
2,Read also Bookreev's account,"Suffice it to say that while the late Bookreev heroically saved others, having summitted himself that day, Krakauer collapsed into his tent. Rest in peace Boukreev, your efforts were not forgotton."
5,MAJESTIC TRAGEDY ON THE ROOF Of THE WORLD,"I don't know if sorrow, exhaustion or agony can be pictured. However, in this book, they are surely worded. Jon Krakauer, one of the survivors of the tragedy, reveals the rise of death above 8000 meters with a most vivid, candid language spoken through his heart. He makes the reader gasp for air, ask for help and pray for a peaceful end. But there's no way, because the reader is trapped in the death zone, wondering why he has come so high and looking for a way out of this total white out.I'd advice anyone interested in Himalayan mountaineering to read this book. It gives a most gruesome yet truthful insight of what goes on above daily ground. It is a majestic tragedy on the roof of the world mistified by the jet winds and sense of death."
5,A haunting story of tragedy that stays in your mind,"This story has everything:heroism,tragedy,edge-of-your-seat suspense,psychological introspection. It is all the more tragic as you read about real people experiencing real horror atop Mt.Everest. The stunning b&w photography, the images of yaks and Sherpas juxtaposed among high-tech gear high in the Himalayas,the ""what if's"" and ""if only's"" that invaribly come to mind.I would often awake from a disturbed sleep with it's images of isolation & desolation atop a blustering peak. Fascinating piece of work!"
3,Exciting and interesting story of very selfish people.,"The book was written with vivid description. The topic was quite interesting. The story flow was ok. The craziness of people to climb this mountain and the selfishness in many people's minds to get to the top at all costs was eye opening. The thrill of ""something"" felt like it was missing. I do feel the account was told to the best of one's recollection, but I just didn't feel the tragedy was represented as horrifically as it probably was experienced."
2,"A well written, slick portrait of some of the facts...","I have read this book, dozens others about Everest and the account by the guide Anatoli entitled The Climb. It seems to me, that the facts that John Krakauer chose to include and the ones that he chose to leave out misinformed the public about the horrible tradgedy on Everest. Anatoli's discription of events, albiet less well written, not slick, picturesque writing, was much more convincing of the facts. I feel heart sorry for any of the survivors of the victims that Everest claimed on that fateful journey. Even more sorry now that John Krackauer has belittled the vicitms themselves in his story version of the event. It is sad when Disney choses to dramatize historic events, it is far sadder when a good writer like John Krackauer does it. If you like this book, and I am sure that you will, please do yourself a favor and read the real story by Anatoli entitled The Climb. It is the real deal"
5,"Riveting, Intense, and Painfully Dramatic","Jon Krakauer is everything I strive to be in a writer. He is not wordy or pretentious. He made me feel as if I were a part of the expedition. A truly heart-felt novel. Thanks, Jon. Hornbein Forever. - C. Milton Davis"
3,Satisfactory,I felt that Jon Krakauer did an adequate job in the book of relating the difficulty and sacrafice that one must undertake in order to climb Mt. Everest. The climbers were all aware of the risks involved and the writer should not be blamed for their tragic deaths.
4,"Moving, personal account that takes you to Everest and back","I actually listened to this on Audiotape, and then went back and bought the book. This book is fascinating. I think for most of us, we think of climbing Everest, if at all, as just a lot of steep climbing. Krakauer does a good job of taking you through each difficulty faced, and what it is like to be there, and how it is difficult to remember things for a book like this even if you HAVE been there. I found myself shivering from the cold, and touched with warmth from the most touching moments in the book. Just like a good writer should."
4,A magnet to your hands,"you will never put this one down. it is a great book although I read it for school and had to study it, it was a really fun book."
3,"I liked the book, but it had weak points.","I liked the book, but I think that the author should have helped the people in his group instead of resting. It appears as if he could have contributed a lot more to save people's lives. I understand that he was under the influence of high altitude, and I know what that does to your brian, but I still believe that he was in a good enough state of mind to rescue his comrades. Besides this, i enjoyed the book, and I thought that it was well written. Definaely worth reading."
5,"The hardcover, illustrated edition is worth the extra bucks","I don't think there's much I can add to the other reviews of Into Thin Air, however I was fortunate to find a copy of the hardcover, illustrated edition. It was well worth the extra money, and the stark pictures in black and white add to the feelings of cold and breathlessness you can't help but feel while reading this book. Additionally, you get more pictures of the key players. Makes a good coffee table book if not your bedtime reading copy."
3,An Exciting Read But Flawed,"I, too, enjoyed the yarn weaved by Jon Krakauer regarding this tragedy but my enthusiam was tempered by his license with factual events and denigration of Anatoly Boukareev. A more accurate depiction of the events that occurred that fateful May can be found in ""Toly's"" book, The Climb.If you have read Krakauer's version of what took place, you will find The Climb a raw, exciting comparison to the events that occurred on the mountain. Don't stop with just a reading of Krakauer's book; your understanding of what really happened will be enhanced by a reading of both accounts."
4,"EVEREST, THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE","ON MAY 10TH, 1996, JON KRAKAUER ASCENDED TO THE SUMMIT OF MT. EVEREST. ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SLEPT FOR FIFTY-SEVEN HOURS AND WAS SUFFERING FROM OXYGEN DEPLETION, HE SAFELY RETURNED TO HIS CAMPSITE THAT NIGHT. AS HE COLLAPSED IN HIS TENT, HE WAS QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT NINETEEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE CAUGHT ON THE SUMMIT AT 29,028 FEET, IN A DESPERATE STRUGGLE FOR THEIR LIVES. TWELVE PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THEIR LIVES THAT NIGHT IN AN INCREDIBLY BRUTAL STORM. IT WOULD BE A NIGHT THAT HE WOULD TRY VERY HARD TO FORGET. I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND DESCRIBED THE STORY OF CLIMBING EVEREST VERY WELL. I MUST SAY THAT IT LEFT A SICKENING FEELING IN MY STOMACH AND GAVE ME A TREMENDOUS FEELING OF LOSS. BUT, DESPITE THE CONTEXT OF THE STORY, I ENJOYED MOST OF THE BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN MOUNTAIN CLIMBING."
3,Article not a book,"The obvious interest in human tragedycompels us to move quickly through this story which races toward a tragic conclusion. While I enjoyed the author's style and commentary on the various climbers and what htey brought to the tragedy, I believe this story was just that--not a full length book. It was better as just a magazine article. A book is a stretch."
1,A Real Snoozer,This book was a waste of several hours of my life. Jon Krakauer rambles on and on about things that don`t make the story progress. Krakauer`s uselss imformation is the bulk of this book. Spare yourself from several nights of misery by not reading this book.
3,"More like ""into boredom""","This wasnt a bad novel but at times it bored me, and i found it difficult to follow with the confusion of the hundreds of different peoples names and the way he jumps around in the story from chapter to chapter. Everytime I read a new chapter it took me half way through the chapter to figure out what was going on. I have to admit though, at times it did put me on the edge of my seat. I think it couldve been better if he only talked about the people essential to the story, and he couldve summed up the story in about 100 pages instead of 330 pages, I cant even remember how many times he got sidetracked from the story. Personally I liked ""Under The Banner Of Heaven"" alot more.Overall I give it a 7 out of 10."
1,"Stick with the facts, Jon","I fully enjoyed reading this book - until I later read other related books, magazine articles, book reviews, articles on the web, etc. How disappointed I was to realize that one of my favorite climbing authors was willing to bend the truth in order to make his story more thrilling to read. It's a pity, but I guess Jon decided it was more important to sell a ton of books than it was to treat others with the respect they deserved or to just stick to the facts."
1,Fiction told to be fact.,"It's not a bad book if you don't mind being lied to. If you wish to read the truth about what happened on May 10, 1996 read ""The Climb""."
1,Read 'The Climb' by Weston DeWalt Instead,"Reading 'The Climb', you will come to understand that Krakauer is another overpaid Westerner, full of hubris. He slept in his tent after his return from the summit of Everest, knowing that others from his team were in peril. Alone, Anatoli Boukreev attempted a rescue."
2,Krakauer Is A Talented Writer,"Unfortunately, he applies that talent to relating lurid tales that appeal to the lowest common denominator. Hence his phoenomonal success. If you enjoy mental images of tourists freezing to death, this is your book. If, on the other hand, you enjoy adventure stories that broaden your horizons, and lift up your spirit, try: Rock Jocks, Wall Rats, And Hang Dogs by John Long; Long On Adventure also by Long; The Way Of The Scout by Tom Brown; My Life In The Verticle World by Lynn Hill; Hollidays In Hell by P.J. O'Rourke; and The Long Walk by Slavomir Rawicz."
2,How a 7th grader sees a vacation,"As you read this book you feel like a kid on vacation in a station wagon. You keep saying are we there yet. This whole book should have been made into a 6 page pamplet. The best parts are in the final 3 chapters. But like the trip in the station wagon, you're so tired of the trip you've forgot why you're there."
1,What a WASTE,Well...beggining started off slowly...the end was ok but it wasn't really my kind of book I don't recomend it unless your an insomniac and need something to bore you to sleep.
5,Gasping for air,"I purchased this audiobook for listening while running. The author, Jon Krakauer, is a natural reader and his voice was very soothing.Into Thin Air is a timeless tale about ego, death, and trauma. From a psychological standpoint, Krakauer truly captures the essence of death and destruction. Likewise, he's quick to point out his own faults and guilt along the way. By the end of it, I had nothing but respect for who he is and the journey he took. It's clear that the tragedy left a permanent mark on his life and climbing career.Thank you for your story, Jon."
4,Exhibition that turns into tragedy,"I bought the e-version after watching the movie. I'm generally fascinated by mount Everest. I wished the book contained more photos. All the photos included in the e-version is gray scale.The book describes the disaster that occurred to mount Everest climbers on May 1996 from Jon Krakauers point of view. There has been other points of views related to the same event which you can read about in Anatoli Boukreev's book; ""The Climb"". It is also worth saying that there is another point of views of one the shepras.It is not known yet which point of view is more accurate since all the climbers were suffering oxygen depletion over the top of the world."
3,too much info!!!,"The modern day adventure is not what it used to be. The life threatening ordeal is much more interesting now in this day and age. Jon Krakauer was in one of the most dangerous of all, trapped in a storm on the highest point of the earth while running out of oxygen, and he found a way to destroy the suspence and fear factor by continously adding more and more facts to the book. By the time you finish it your head almost explodes with information. It was a good book but had too much information about what, at least I, didnt want to know."
3,Pretty good,"Into Thin Air was not the best book I've ever read, but is still a good read. Jon Krakauer uses good tone and imagery, and is very descriptive. A good book to read just to pass the time."
4,Into Thin Air,If you are looking for a book to bring you on an adventure with its ups and downs this is the book. It provides lots of details and makes you feel like you were on the mountain yourself. I read every word and the only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I am going to have to read the rest of the accounts of the people that were on that expedition. I strongly suggest this book to anyone!
2,Characters hard to follow and writing on first grade level,"This book was not bad, but it was not what I would call a classic either. The story was interesting, but everything was glossed over so quickly that by the end of the book where the author is talking about characters doing this and that, I did not know who most of them were or were they came from. The writing level of the book is amateurish at best. For those who like simple reading and a quick story this may be a good book for you. For me it was a bit of a let down and I thought the author of the book was a big part of the problem on Everest and ends up profiting from it."
2,$6.39...Into Thin Air!,"For all the hype, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why this book is so highly rated. This book is a prime example of what happens when you take a magazine ""journalist"" and give him a contract to write a book. This thing has so many footnotes (some of which are half the page!) that the experience becomes incredibly distracting. If he felt compelled to do half-page footnotes, why not just do a #@!& side-bar, like in a MAGAZINE!See the Imax movie called Everest...and save yourself from burning a $6 hole in your pocket."
4,Into Thin Air,"The book Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer is a personal account of the Mt. Everest disaster. An adventurous expedition to the summit of Everest in May of 1996. Krakauer's report of the disaster in this book are recollections of the events that transpired on Mt. Everest. This one expedition took the lives of thirteen climbers due to the radical change in the weather. Mt. Everests summit is at an altitude of 29,028 feet, ruefully the cruising altitude of most jet airliners. Krakauer also goes into great detail about the history of Mt. Everest from the first expedition, to the clean up of the mountain, to some of the present day expeditions. This is overall a good book. It is slow going at times and the vocabulary is very extensive, yet the excitement of the book is worth it. We do recommend reading this book."
5,Great Book,"If you enjoy hiking or mountain climbing you definitely have to get this book. I first saw ""Everest"" at the IMAX theater. From there I was lead to Krakauer's book which I found very difficult to put down. There isn't a dull moment. You will become very intimate with what went on that fateful day when 8 climbers lost their lives on the highest mountain in the world. The events leading up to the disaster almost sounded like it was made for a novel. Plenty of negative foreshadowing occurs before the disaster, including a Puja that normally gets performed before each and every ascent. This Buddhist ceremony is considered very important and some Sherpas will not ascend unless one is performed. It just so happened that the Rinpoche was sick so it couldn't be performed. You will also get a glimpse of the heroics of America's foremost high-altitude climber, Ed Viesturs and the IMAX ""Dream Team"" as they helped to rescue Beck Weathers and Makalu Gau from almost certain death."
5,Fantastic Book!,I recently became obsessed with reading about Everest and this book has been by far the best I have read. Jon Krakauer is a fantastic author and has put together arguably the best account of the tradgedy of 1996.
4,A Curious Observation,"Interesting that, in a book which treats so much with death, there is so little mention of God"
5,One of the best books that I have ever read,"This book tells about the hardships of climbing. If you are a climber, you will love this book. I know that I did."
3,makes you want to know more,i liked this book but i didnt love it. i found it hard to follow at times. the subject matter was very interesting and sparked my interest in climbing (more specifically why people climb) and geography. i'd like to see the imax movie.
3,"Good, illustrative account that maintains sober perspective.","A good book that, while recounting the tragic accounts that unfolded over the course of only a few days, never falls into a burdening and depressing tone. The most memorable ""travelogue"" since the more reflective, lighter ""I Should Have Stayed Home"". Mr. Krakauer was exceedingly wise in holding lyricism at bay, however. The words of Neil Beidleman that conclude the text are very chilling and remain to be the most ambitious conclusion Krakauer could have chosen."
2,This book was an satisfactory read,"I didn't really enjoy INTO THIN AIR. It was very slow-moving and it didn't strike me as being exciting in almost any way. Krakauer dragged out what should have been small supporting details into whole chapters; things like describing EVERYBODY'S life who was on the mountain at that time, and even some who weren't on the mountain. However, there were a few exciting scenes - like when the Chinese lady was freezing to death and when Beck was very close to dying. Only read this book if you a mature adult who has the time and patience to listen to a long exposition."
5,Page-turner,"What an amazing story of an Everest expedition which went way wrong, and that's not to say that there is any easy way to climb Everest. It all depends on the weather and how sick you are from altitude, both mentally and physically. Great read!"
3,Informative and Descriptive; too Descriptive,"The beginning starts out a little slow, and then picks up some speed. Krakauer uses many metaphors which are good to an extent. I almost got lost in the book just trying to keep up with the names, and the things people were doing. I did like the fact that Jon keeps us updated; not missing a second of the action from cover to cover. Unfortunatly, I dont like it in books when a lot of people die. This book kept my attention about as much as when someone gets hit in the face with a snowball, it's great for about 15 seconds then goes away, and is fun to think about nothing much more. I give Krakauer 3 stars on this one"
5,An engrossingly beautiful account of an unpredictab tragedy,"John writes with an elegance born out of experience as a person and climber. John expresses himself honestly, humbly and poetically (in a sense) which engrosses one to keep reading. This book brings the reader into the experience of Everest 1996 as no other fiction book I have read. It is so very well done, I am reading it for a third time!"
4,This was an excellent tale of survival.,I found this book to be very informative and I believe the author has a good knowledge of mountaineering and the history of mountaineering. I would recomend reading this book.
5,One of the best books ever.,Jon Krakauer is an awesome writer. He explains his whole account clearly. I read this book in 3 days and it was hard to put it down. This is probably my favorite Travel book ever.
4,"Great Story, Well Told...*","I couldn't agree more with that masses that have deemed this book a worthwhile read. From start to finish, Krakauer's telling of the Everest tragedy is fascinating and well, tragic. One could compare this book to Sebastian Junger's ""The Perfect Storm"", because like that book, the author does a wonderful job of compiling relevant facts, character background, and storytelling to provide the reader with a well-rounded read. My one complaint with this book would be the almost silly overuse of asterisks to make additional points that more often than not could have been included with the rest of the text. Call me lazy, but why should I have to jump around the page when doing so isn't really necessary? I don't know, it's not too much trouble, and the book is definitely interesting, so don't let my pet peeve dissuade you. Take my advice, and venture ""Into Thin Air"". (Wow, what a finish!)"
5,A breathtaking account of how far people can push themselves,"In his gripping account of an unavoidable disaster on the worlds tallest peak, Krakauer hauntingly goes back to the mountain in words and pictures. Written with such sensitivity and detail, I felt as if I ascended the mountain with the ill fated expedition. Krakauer reflects on why people push themselves so hard in the quest for a summit and how common sense goes out the window at high altitude. A must read for anyone who watches the documentaries and wonders, ""what is Everest really like?"""
4,A Fascinating Look At Extreme Mountain Climbing,"This book was so mesmerizing that I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. Friends who have read this book agreed with me that it was such an attention grabber that they read it in one or two sittings. I have to say that I'm not a mountaineer-type. I love to hike but I have never understood what would push people to climb Everest or any other peaks for that matter. This book did not shed any light on why climbers feel compelled to ""push the envelope"" but enlightened me to the harsh reality of high-altitute climbing. I was completely engrossed by the story and felt as though I was part of the team. Great eye-opening window into the world of high-altitude climbing."
5,Hpes and dreams become a nightmare!,"I found the book very enjoyable and a quick read for anyone that enjoys true life adventure stories. The author made Everest come alive. The actual ordeal was less than 72 hours. The author provides relevant background on the history of Everest. The only thing that bothered me is that this is one person's view of the events. I wonder about the objectivity of the author's position, especially experiencing this disaster first hand."
5,Mesmerizing!,"This book will leave you spellbound as you experience a firsthand account of the fateful Mount Everest expedition in the spring of 1996, which left 8 climbers dead. Krakauer was hired by ""Outside"" magazine to write a feature story on the climb, but found himself fighting for his life as a series of errors and a spring blizzard collided, leading to doom on summit day.More than just an engrossing yarn, Krakauer's story charts the psychology that drives man to test the elements, and powerfully brings home the truth that Mother Nature still rules supreme on the mountain the Nepalese call ""Sagarmatha""."
2,"It was terribly boring, I hardley fascinating.","I thought the book was fair. It gives an inside and personal look at climbing Mount Everest that is somewhat interesting. The mindset of the climbers was the most interesting part of the book. Although, I liked him analyzing the decisions of the guides and trying to figure out what was going through their minds he didn't need to do it twenty-four hours a day. It became boring and I lost interest. Jon may have written the book to free his feelings and give some detailed insight as to what happened up on Everest in 1996, but was unsuccessful due to the discrepencies.It made the book more confusing. I feel this book is not worth taking the time to read."
2,Very disappointed and bored by this story,"I found it VERY difficult to follow at times. I kept waiting for the pages to grab me right through the end. I expected more thrills and heart pounding excitment and instead got extremely in depth details that were totally unnecessary about climbing tools. If you are an avid climber then read away - if not, take a course and then try to relate. Krakauer relates this to a small percentage of people who are climbing enthusiasts rather than to everyone."
5,"balanced account, gripping story-telling","Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of describing the horrors faced by climbers on Mt. Everest in the 1996 season. He is very honest about his own, and others', shortcomings."
3,"Fascinating, but not fulfilling","I wish that I shared the enthusiasm for this book that most of the other reviewers have expressed. Unfortunately, I found the book interesting because it described the tragegy that ensued, but disappointing because I wanted to know more about the skills and techniques that are necessary to attempt something of this endeavor. I wanted to know more about Everest."
5,"This was a powerful, disturbing book","This was one of the most distressing books I have ever read. I read it twice in two days and then bought copies for everyone I know. It was an experience, but I still can't understand why anyone would want to climb that mountain. Buy this book and read it. You will never forget it."
5,INCREDIBLE STORY!,"If this story weren't true, I don't think I'd be able to believe it. What makes this account even more fascinating -- besides the incredible events of the plot -- is his modest, forthright style lacking embellishment or exaggeration. I loved the ending, too, and how it provoked in the author a mixture of both nostalgia and regret... regret, after conquering this king of all mountains.... I'm a total mountain-climbing ignoramus, but I just loved this novel, and I would recommend it for any voracious reader."
3,Excellent Reading,"I would have given this book a much higher rating but I just don't think much of the autor and his actions. The other people in the book seem very brave. Such a tragedy, but then the people must have known what they were getting into by camp 1."
1,Why do so many people like this book?,"We all know this type of book. It looks interesting, people are raving, so you pick it up and begin reading. Starts off slow, you think ""ah, it's just getting started."" 100 pages into it, and it's still getting started. 200 pages in, and you consider dumping it. But you keep reading anyway, people love this book, it'll get better, right? At some point, you notice there's only a few pages left and then you realize with that slightly sinking feeling that you've wasted your time on a book that goes nowhere.What people see in this book, I don't know. A story as good as this deserves a better storyteller."
1,Jon Krakauer dosen't know what he is talking about!,"The author wrote this with an extreme sense of knowledge about everyone who was on Scott Fischer's expedition, which is strange, because he was on ROB HALL'S expedition !!! He makes a lot of the characters seem like complete fools, ex.: Sandy Hill Pittman, which they are not. Also, he barely gives Anatoli Boukreev (d.12/25/97-climbing accident) any credit for saving numerous lives. Krakauer was in a tent for the majority of the rescue, asleep, and he knows everything that happened? Fraid not ! For the TRUE story, read Anatoli Boukreev's book, THE CLIMB."
2,Into whine air,"The book ""into thin air"" is unabashedly depressing, thoughtless, and droll. Though adept at whining, Mr. Krakauer does not focus on the real story, that of himself, rather the book quickly degenerates into a self gratifying attempt to remove blame from himself and place it upon others. Page upon page of statements beginning with ""if only"" does not benefit the survivors or dignify those who lost thier lives. In short, Mr. Krakauer has done little to honor those who died and much to hurt those who survived."
1,Fiction and Libel written by a snake,"The story is entertaining, but sadly lacking in fact. Krakauer spreads gross lies about Anatoli Boukreev in this work of fiction. When Anatoli Boukreev responded to this slander, Krakauer shut up, until Anatoli Boukreev tragically died, then Krakauer opened his lying mouth again. Krakuer is a man without honor and this book should be recognized for the lie that it is. I suggest reading ""The Climb,"" if you want non-fiction."
2,Into Thin Air,"When I chose this book, I chose it because of all of the good things I heard about it. How it was so exciting, wrenching, impossible to put down.Well, I got to reading it, expecting a thriller, only to be absolutely bored. He rambled on about useless information that had no great impact on me besides losing my interest completely. Yet, I had picked this book to do a project on for english, so I had to read all of it. Once I got to page 207 it wasn't that bad. The pages before that however were pure torture.I also questioned how true his account of the event was. He seemed to shine a light on himself throughout the book. He made it seem like he was the only one on the mountain who know what was going on. I found a lot of that hard to believe, which led me to further dislike the book."
2,To sleep or not to sleep,The book Into Thin Air was a very slow book. You really couldn't get into it until after about chapter twelve. The author gave you a lot of facts about the mountain and the expedition but he said so much that sometimes you became confused. After you get through that though the book becomes very exciting and interesting and you start to like it. I liked the facts very much and it taught me a lot but in ways it is somewhat sloppy. The ending has to be one of the most dramatic endings I have ever read though; it's surprising and sad. The ending makes it worth the read so I would recommend the book if you have the patience.
1,"A good story, but not exactly Nonfiction.","At the time that I read Into Thin Air, I really liked it. It was exciting, harrowing & informative. However upon reading ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev I find myself intensely disappointed in Jon Krakauer's ""fact"" reporting. There were several pieces of information that Krakauer had in his possesion regarding Bourkreev & others that he either ignored & didn't cross check his facts or worse, he lied about. Either way, I am disappointed & this will be the last Krakauer book I read."
4,This book was gripping and realistic.,"This story was a five star story. To read of such tradgedy is sad, but we are all curious, and this is why the book has such a grip. This was not a five star book however because Krakaur athough a talented writter lacks some vital component in his prose that usually keeps a reader turning the pages. It was the fabulous story, instead of the author that did all of the work in this book."
4,Riveting!,I never knew I was such a fast reader! I began and finished this book traveling across Washington state one weekend. The only thing missing is about 500 hundred more detailed pages. I kept referring to the maps & pictures included in the book. Such an amazing story...I actually had to read some of the passages aloud to anyone who would listen (or to myself) just to get the full effect. This book is at the same time inspirational and infuriating. It is to Krakauer's credit that he is able to tell such a personal account and still remain somewhat objective in the process.
4,I still don't get it,"I've never understood why a man would climb a mountain like Everest. I could understand climbing a mountain for the view, or to reach some valuable commodity hidden away at the summit, or even to simply impress a woman, but for me, 'because it's there', doesn't quite get it done. It may be an answer, but it's not an explanation.In INTO THIN AIR, John Krakauer does a wonderful job of telling the tale of the horrid events that took place on Everest in the spring of 1996. He makes the struggle, the sorrow, and even his own contrition come alive in a very gripping, yet still comfortable read. But what he doesn't do is make me understand why those people, himself included, were there in the first place.Maybe there is no explanation? Maybe there just isn't a way to put the reasons into words? But when all was said and done, this fine book still left me thinking that even if all had gone well with the climb, none of these people would have enjoyed a single minute of it."
4,Very Interesting Book,"Not being a mountain climber myself, I was worried that I might not understand some of the more technical terms, etc. that might be associated with a book like this. However, I was happy that the author made this an easy read for inexperienced readers like me.The book caught my attention right away and I got to know the characters and felt for them. I did think that the author held back quite a bit when talking about the characters' true personalities though.Overall, I thought it was an easy read, very interesting, and had a very moving storyline to it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the fascination of pushing one's body to the ultimate limits."
4,Read this book.,"This is a really exciting book! It is about a blizzard disaster while climbing Mount Everest. In this book a lot of things go wrong. The author of this book was on the climb, so you get a first hand experience. I am not a big time reader but with this book, I couldn't put it down. It is a book with action, comedy,emotion all in one . If you are a reader who likes a good adventure, this a book for you!"
3,Only one account of the 1996 Everest trip,"To get a different (some times quite different) account of the Everest disaster, read ""The Climb"", by A. Boukareev, the Mountain Madness guide that was at the scene and is mentioned in Krakuer's book."
3,Read /My Vertical World/ by Jerzy Kukuczka instead,"/Into Thin Air/ is worth reading, but I found /My Vertical World/ by Jerzy Kukuczka to be a better tale of mountain climbing and its tragedies. (Kukuczka was the second man, after Reinhold Messner, to climb the world's fourteen 8000m mountains.)"
3,Don't mistake Krakauer's opinions for fact,"This is an enthralling book, I couldn't put it down. I did not have much interest in mountaineering (either doing or reading about) but since reading Into Thin Air I have read every other book I could find about the deaths on Everest in '96. The difference in perspectives from the different authors is amazing. If you are reading Into Thin Air you should remember that Krakauer has not written objectively, he is telling his own story. His opinions reflect badly on Anatoli Boukreev, who was a guide on Scott Fischer's expidition. The impression I was left with after reading books by Boukreev, Michael Groom and Lene Gammelgaard (probably spelt wrong there) was that if there was a hero on Everest in 1996 it was Anatoli Boukreev"
5,A good read-doesn't bash like people say.,"This was an excellent book written about a tragic disaster by a person who was there to witness it. Many people have criticized Krakauer for bashing people in this book-putting blame on certain people for the outcome of this climb. I didn't see that he was being purposely hurtful to people, but just writing down the things that he observed while he was on the mountain. Anatoli Boukreev has written 'The Climb' as a rebuttal to what he perceives as a malicious attack on his character in 'Into Thin Air.' I haven't read it yet, but I intend too. I don't think badly about anyone on that expedition after reading this book. It was horrifying to realize that this was a real event. I'm not blaming anyone, but one has to wonder if Yasuko could have been saved, if Beck Weathers got up and walked himself out of that storm."
4,A gripping read,"The story moves forward relentlessly. Like the author in his efforts to reach the summit, you will keep reading not because you want to, but because you have to"
4,Entertaining but short,"A very entertaining novel but at 250 pages, only takes a weekend to read. Is it just me or is anyone else out there getting tired of spending $20+ for 250 page efforts. It makes you appreciate Clancy, Michener and King who will at least give you a novel that can keep you entertained for weeks at a time"
4,Into Thin Air,"Into Thin Air is a book full of adventure and suspense. Jon Krakauer's personal account of the 1996 tragedy on Mt. Everest hooks the reader and makes them feel like their on the mountain with Krakauer and his teammates on the expedition. My favorite part of the book was when they started climbing the mountain and when they got to the top. My least favorite part of the book was the beggining because it went into too much detail about the history of Mt. Everest and the history of past expeditions. I recommend this book to anyone, even if your not into mountain climbing."

My least favorite part of the book was the beggining because it went into too much detail about the history of Mt. Everest and the history of past expeditions.
3,A fairly well written book on an unnecessary subject,"Why is it of interest to know about people who artificially create a dangerous situation in order to feel important? There would be no need for these ""heroes"" if one didn't feel the need to climb Mt. Everest. There re plenty of worthwhile endeavors to benefit mankind such as policework and firefighting, just to name two. This was a terrible tragedy, but one that could have been avoided. Climbing Mt. Everest is a personal decision fraught with known dangers and an activity that benefits no one except the climber."
4,Into Thin Air takes you along on the climb,"Jon Krakauer, though exhaustive research, takes the reader along with him and his fellow climbers on the ill-fated 1996 expedition. The final conversation between Rob Hall, trapped alone on the South Summit, and his wife in New Zealand is heartbreaking. I cannot imagine being that cold, that alone, that tired. This book is a good read."
5,Can't put the book down once you begin.,One of the best written books I've ever read.I actually thought I was on the Mt. as the story unfolded before me. After you read the book rent the movie of the same title.
5,Fabulous reading-couldn't put it down!,If you like action and adventure this is the book for you. Once you read the first few pages you won't want to put it down. It is hard to believe people atually endure that kind of hardships and actually enjoy it. Get this book!
4,Into Thin Air - WOW!,"This book is an absolute must read! It is a true story of the 1996 trajedy on Everest, however the book reads like a novel. I also reccomend ""The Climb"" which also give another perspective on the same days on the mountain. I didnt however like his personal slander toward Scott Fischer of Mountain Madness. I could have done without that."
5,Non stop thriller,Jon Krakauer brings Mt. Everest right into your lap. I suddenly have the urge to take up climbing.....
3,"Exciting, but at a cost.","I enjoyed Into Thin Air, it was a very thrilling story. But, I worry that it may actually encourage the very situation it warns about: inexperienced climbers paying large sums of money to be guided to the top! How many people reading this are thinking ""It couldn't happen to me...""?"
5,Enthralling,"I do not climb mountains but I couldn't put this book down as I pondered how the human spirit can be so determined, and how human failures can ovecome even the most sensible people.I later read 'The Climb' which a longer more detailed account of the Everest diaster. While I am not the kind of person who watches Rescue-911 for the sheer morbitity of it, I was intreged by what this story has to say about commerical explotation, captialism at all costs, and how, when stripped of everything we are left only with own determination and good judgement."
5,A gripping tale of life at the extreme,"Inspiring. That one word says everything about this book. This is a story about life, friendship, honor, courage, and adventure. I couldn't get enough of this book - I just could not put it down."
4,"Big mountain, Big adventure, Big Disaster and big words","My gripe: too many big words like paucity when scarceness would work. Also, too many terms for mountain-climbers only and not enough definition to tell non-mountain-climbers what the terms mean. Other than those things, an excellent account of an adventure which went awry for some and awry for the survivors. Even I was in shape, I wouldn't try the climb. I hate garbage, and I'd hate finding a body. Climbing Everest would lead me to tons of both. How depressing, as was the book which I couldn't put down."
4,A fantastic read...,"Really enjoyed the book. Although there are some discrepancies regarding the particulars, I found the book to be very insightful as to what it takes to complete such a climb."
5,AWESOME!,"This sounds cheesy, but Into Thin Air was the best non-fiction book I've ever read. It was so incredibly vivid; I was either laughing or crying through the very end. The only downside is that this is a paper-back so it will need to be replaced within five years after I pass it around to everyone I know! I recommend buying it in hard-back!"
4,Into Thin air,Jon Krakauer's description of a complex event that has caused significant controversy in the mountaineering world and obvious torment in his own life was both disturbing and gratifying. I now have a much greater appreciation for the incredible will necessary to climb Mt. Everest as well as an appreciation for the pain that succeeding or failing can and often does cause. I feel like I somehow know the people on Mt. Everest on May 10th 1996.
3,Now i know what not to do with an overabundance of money,"After reading this book, I wrestled with two types of emotions. One was overwhelming sympathy for the friends and family members of the victims. the other was utter confusion as to what prompted these individuals to blow such a large sum of money on a life threatening venture. Overall, the book was interesting and well-written but I can't give it a higher rating than I did simply because of the fact that i see these people as senseless idiots with nothing better to do with their time and money than risk their lives ."
5,You should all be ashamed.,"Everyone who is reviewing this book seems to want to blame Krakauer. It was not his duty to go out and help these people, because he would have DIED if he did. Boukreev, on the other hand, was a GUIDE. He is PAID an extrordinary sum to save these people's lives.Krakauer did what every single person who has bashed him would have done: He went to sleep to avoid death. Of course he didn't want the other climbers to lose their lives. But it wouldn't help them if he had gone out and killed himself as well!I challenge any of you to climb Everest in whiteout conditions, and then try to save someone's life. If you actually do it, call me. 1-800-WHY-BLAME"
4,A great non-fiction tale of death and triumph on Everest.,"The book was in itself not thrilling but, a non-fiction book can't be. I liked the way Krakauer described the events in such detail. It makes you want to never even think of climbing this mountain. I had not heard about this very much so I was still not knowing of what was going to happen. And the death zone above 25,000 feet gave you a sense of excitement when they were up there. All in all the book was extremely satisfying to the very end and if you want to read a book that will take you to the top of Everest read this book. It's a good one."
4,Man is Fallible,"This is a haunting tale that rivets the reader from beginning to end. The breadth of human motivation, action and reaction described is fascinating. This would be a great book to read if you are in the throws of ""cabin fever"" as it will make you appreciate your cozy, climate controlled home like nothing else!"
2,disappointed reader,"this book was very boring. the first few chapters went very slow because of the historical info. when he started writing about the trip it got better because he wondered if the other climbers in the group were better climbers than him. when he wrote about being on the mountain is when i enjoyed the book the most. he wrote about his feelings, what he was thinking during the expedition, and his desire to reach the summit. the end was extremly depressing and it made me not want to climb any mountain let alone everest. i realize that it was based on a true story but it could of had a better ending"
1,Into Thin Air : A Personal Account of Jon Krakauer's Ego,"Jon Krakauer spends a remarkable amount of this book alluding to the fact that he is a much stronger individual than most of the other paying clients. I was impressed by his original story in outside magazine, this book didn't add much (apart from the fact that the second time around he got his facts straight).Near the end of the book he endlessly whines about the fact that nobody tried to wake him to help with the rescue, despite the fact that he already mentioned that someone tried (and failed) to wake him to help with the rescue. In the end I was surprised that I hadn't really learned any more from reading this book than I had in reading the original story in Outside.It's a good story, if you aren't bothered by Jon's ego trip. I was."
1,DON'T CELEBRATE FAILURE !!!!!!,How did this piece of crap become a best seller? Krakauer and his buddies failed on their expedition because they were unprepared. The only thing Krakauer has accomplished with this book is show his complete lack of integrity. John - you helped 6 people die. You have no business profiting from their stupidity.
1,Good reading until you learn the truth from The Climb,"When I first read this I thought this was an excellent 5 star book until I read The Climb and researched online what the heck happened. It is unfortunate that Jon K made wrong remarks about Anatoli. If it werent for Anatoli's heroics in putting the fixed ropes, nobody would have made it to the top that day...even Jon K and he wont have his lying book. Anatoli wasnt a selfish guide. He was with a client on the way up and down. It is plain common sense and good mountaineering practice to have one of the guides lead the trail up and down in case there is an emergency. The bottom line is Jon K's team got obliterated in Everest. Mountain Madness were successful except for Scott Fischer because of Anatoli who unfortunately died a year later. The awards from the mountaineering community says it all about Anatoli. Jon K did not get any awards from the climbing experts except from the money hungry publishers and media."
5,RIVETING - what else can I say?,"I was sitting here by my pool in 90 degrees, shivering, as I read this book. What a story! And it's true! (at least from Krakauer's perspective). I found myself holding my breath in spots. It's not without it's flaws - even though he tells us in the beginning that he is writing this book to exorcize his personal demons, I found the self-flagellation to be a bit much. And there is not much character development about some of his other climbing partners - but I guess Jon is just saying that he never did get to know some of his partners very well. Other than that, this book is a *MUST READ* for any climbers, or wanna-be climbers, or anyone interested in finding out what it's *REALLY* like outside where you are high enough to look in the window of a 747"
5,Backseat drivers take note: this is not the ride for you.,"If you're not prone to sanctimonious second guessing, you'll find Jon Krakauer's account one of the most haunting books you'll read this year. With an effective combination of reportorial objectivity and personal observation, Krakauer recounts his terrifying Everest experience with a soft-spoken equanimity few could muster after surviving such an ordeal.Most refreshing and ultimately heartbreaking, however, is Krakauer's candor as he acknowledges that despite a year's reflection, he doesn't have any answers. Although Into Thin Air could be viewed as just another book about bad things happening to good people, Krakauer has successfully teased the genuine human story from his hellish nightmare: that sometimes good people do bad things."
5,Why They Do It,"There are many chronicles of mountaineering exploits, and, as it should, this book tries to explain why a disaster happened. But the real achievement of the book lies elsewhere.If you ever wondered why men and women continually attempt the highest and most dangerous peaks, you will never receive a better answer than this book contains. From the romantic to the ambitious, the drawn to the driven, the courageous to the merely deluded, they are all here. There are lots of reasons men and women attempt high peaks, and most of them have never been more thoroughly explored or completely revealed than in this riveting account of best-laid plans gone astray. The one minor weakness here is the author's guilt over his inability to save others who were lost. Though refreshingly honest, he confesses rather too often in these pages. Whatever it may do to help purge his guilt, it can only wear on the reader who has no reason to blame Krakauer as he blames himself"
4,You will never look at a mountain the same.,"Although Krakauer is not a very sophistocated writer, his down to earth style captivated me from the start, and I was transposed up the mountain with his team. The plot sometimes lagged, but in the particularily tragic and senseless moments of the individual difficulties, I could not put it down, and found myself wiping tears from my eyes, imagining Robb talking with his wife on the cell phone. A truly moving experience, we should all learn from."
3,Surviving Death On Top Of The World,"Jon Krakauer, the author of Into Thin Air, tells am amazing story of a life threatening experience. This book is hard to put down after the first 200 pages. The beginning is full of information that is important to the novel but it's not the most thrilling. After fighting through the first 200 pages the story was exciting, disgusting, and inspiring. I give this book 3 stars. It is not quite a 4 star book but defiantly a high quality story. If you like true stories, and you are not busy this book is well worth your spare time."
4,Engaging. Mesmerizing. Disastrous.,"Gripping true account of an expedition to Everest gone wrong. We get to know some of the folks on the trip and the egos of those leading the way up the hill. The missing element is the author's inability to define or describe why people are obsessed with climbing in the first place. What motivates climbers to risk their lives. The audience demands more than the Mallory explanation ""because it's there."""
4,A fascinating story of the human spirit,"This book is Jon Krakauer's first hand account of his 1996 climb up Mt. Everest with a climbing group led by the renowned Rob Hall. This season is known as the deadliest season in the history of Everest.I like how this book is written because Krakauer doesn't set out to make anyone, not even himself, look like some sort of hero in this incident. It seems as if he tells the story as it was according to his memory, and the heroes just naturally shine through.As I read this book, I encountered many emotions. There were points where I felt joy for great accomplishments and sadness for losses. There were people who I just looked upon with great disdain. I also feel for Jon Krakauer who seems to spend his life with many regrets over that tremendous night of loss.Overall, I found this book to be a very good read."
3,"To 29,000 feet up and back","My name is Katie and I am a senior in high school. I read the book, Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer, as a lit circle assignment in my senior English class. Though the book was mostly a history lesson, it was also some-what interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read long novels about real life, dramatic occurrences, people's pain and hardships, and the prices one risks to take an adventure to the heights of the world. When you read this book you will get a sense of the events happening on the mountain, and what the people in the book are feeling. It's almost as if you are there yourself. It's a story you will never forget."
5,Captivating,"I agree with most people that have reviewed this book. It is absolutely captivating as well as horrifying. Krakauer helps you to strap on your crampons and take the climb with the expedition. As the horror evolved, I found myself not able to put down the book. Especially once the climbers found themselves struggling for their lives during the decent. Definitely a book for adventure/nature people!"
5,"An Intense, Captivating and Emotional Read","I Can't begin to describe how amazing this book was. At many times you forget that this is a true story, the way it pulls you in, and once you do remember, the shock of that reality is unbelievable. I watched the Imax film at a museum while in the middle of reading the book, and didn't know that they were both from the same 1996 climbing season until about 15 minutes in and i finally clued in. The two together paint such a vivid picture, although i can never truly understand what it was like, of those tragic events, that i was caught completley off guard. All i can say is that, you, the person reading this comment, should most definitely pick this one up. Even if this is not the sort of book you normally read, i know it wasn't the sort of thing that i enjoy reading, trust me when i say that you will most certainly enjoy this one."
3,I gotta be me!,"Into Thin Air is a well-told tale of arrogance, stupidity and self-absorption. It was difficult to work up sympathy for any of the participants who, while spending tens of thousands of dollars risking their lives (and the lives of others) at four plus miles altitude, seemed to care so little for spouses and children left back home. Another interesting subtext to the book is the description of low paid Sherpas doing all the real work while the climbers 'aclimate' themselves and presumably grapple with the weightier issues of the soul. After all climbing Everest is a spiritual journey right? Testing oneself. Stretching limits, etc. Can't find meaning in everyday life? Work at a soup kitchen, coach little league, tutor a child, read to the elderly. Donate blood. Stop thinking about yourself all the time."
5,Courage still exists!,"Courage still exists in this world! I couldn't put 'Into Thin Air' down. The bodies of those left on the roof of the world are a monument to the spirit of these men. What better way to leave this Earth then by doing something you want to do in a noble effort. I pray that I will not die in my bed, but die climbing my own mountains of life in the same way 'Into Thin Air' so dramatically describes. I've given this book to everyone I care about. It's not just about climbing Everest, its about how you live your life!"
4,Once the book got going it kept me interested,"Into Thin Air is a book about an expedition that went into the ever famous Mount Everest. While on his expedition Jon Krakauer tells about the hardships and his near death experiences. He tells, in great depth, about the people he met on the mountain. Jon also goes into great detail telling how cold and miserable the trip was. He really made me think that I was up there experiencing the same thing he was. At first the book started slow, but in the end the breath taking thrill of who was going to live and who was going to freeze to their untimely death told the story. In this book every minute could be the difference between life and death. I'm glad I read this book, and I would surely encourage it to anybody that likes to be on the edge of their seat while they read. This book really did that for me. Thanks Jon, I had fun reading your book."
5,Exciting and touching,"Into Thin Air was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I couldn't put it down. I was enthralled and excited while reading it. The tradgedy that was the everest expedition of the 1996 season does scare me, but it has sparked my interest in climbing. Although Everest is totally out of the question, a nice small mountain somewhere out west truly appeals after reading the book. Applause to Jon Krakauer for a wonderful book, and good luck to him in the future. I can't wait to start reading his ""Into the Wild."
4,Predecessor to the Kevin Spacey series.,"This is the predecessor to the Netflix series with Kevin Spacey, but darker. The British series from the early 90's is almost like a Greek tragedy. Reviews of the Netflix series generally do not credit this earlier series, which pioneered the direct to the audience commentary and has characters and plot line very similar."
4,2nd Series Better Than the first,Tension builds and I began to read this even during the day! It is hard to leave off each night. Odd ending for the king - don't want to give the ending away for anyone. Actor who played the king was so handsome - he needed to be firmer.
1,Eye Glazing,"Much respect to the lovingly-crafted 5-star review (above), but I would not recommend chancing a rental fee on this if you are merely curious about it. I had this (""House of Cards"" is the U.S. name) suggested to me because of my strong interest in politics, Britain, Michael Kitchen, and intrigues. Couldn't get through the first episode I became so impatient with the style, the acting, the script, the tedious faux irony, and I was streaming it for free. I am not just writing this to offer negativity - there are nothing but glowing reviews and 5-stars on the American title side - so I thought I'd offer some balance. (It ain't Downton Abbey!!) I was envisioning a ""sneer factor"" on the order of ""Devil Wears Prada"" kind of funny. This turned me off from the beginning and kept at it... so I did the same in return."
4,Very good soundtrack,"This is a very good soundtrack by a very good composer. It contains 70 minutes of edge-of-your-seat action and after you finish listening to this you will be wide awake. This is action music at its best. If you are a Goldsmith fan, or an action fan, or a fan of the movie, or any other fan, go out and buy this CD."
3,"The master takes a machine-gun, and sprays out a soundtrack.","Although I suppose it's good to have the full soundtrack to the film, I didn't find this entry from Goldsmith to be very entertaining. The thematic material is kept to a minimum; which worked fine in the film, but made for a rather harsh listen in the car stereo.<g> Arguably, the most 'action-intense' score Goldsmith ever wrote; but beware if you prefer strong leitmotif in your action scores."
1,"very low quality item, it broke!","Thats what I get for trusting the Rubbermaid brand name, I guess.Don't buy this product, it's poor quality."
5,Excellent - perfect addition for Cardinals,"This tray is a great addition to a Droll Yankee feeder. It helps catch the seeds so they don't all fall to the ground, which is really helpful when you want to preserve your quality/expensive seed as long as possible. Our Cardinals are much happier now that they can perch on the tray - it's very sturdy. We also have some chubby mourning doves that appreciate the tray too."
3,Selections from Four Albums,"Contains five (5) selections total, drawn from the following albums:1) Comalies: ""Heaven's a Lie"" and ""Swamped""2) Unleashed Memories: ""Senzafine""3) In a Reverie: ""My Wings""4) Lacuna Coil: ""No Need to Explain""The three stars does not mean the music is mediocre. I do not know the music, but thought the list would help people who find the official product description insufficient."
5,Very Pleased,"I chose this model because it was the highest rated of the Consumer Reports models tested that was compatible with my Mac's IMovie software. I have already used it for a family trip and for filming several of my kids basketball tournaments. It has been very easy to use. The features that I really enjoy: Fast transfer of footage from the camera to my computer. With HDD it is impossible to tape over previous recorded footage. Taping at highest quality it can hold up to 7.5 hours of footage. After a day of shooting I transfer everything to IMovie and then delete it from the camera. I edit the stuff I like with music and titles and then burn it to a DVD. Wow,its so nice not to have the mountain of mini-dv cassettes piling up in the hall closet and then trying to remember everything that was on them. Overall I am really happy with the camera, but even more pleased with how well it works with my Mac."
3,just ok...,Best experience was at my son's middle school concert. Was not very pleased with the image stabilizer at only a short zoom. Sound was descent. Mediocre ease of use. Horrible software. Drains the battery fast. I ended up getting the Panasonic SDR-H18 and it seems to have been a better buy.
1,Don't Buy from this Guy,"One star instead of negative star, only because the main product essential works. The main charging unit was not included. Seller said it was. After contact, he said he put it in the box. The box was tattered, no charger. I had to buy one elsewhere.Also, it was advertised as new; it is not. I discovered a micro-sd card in the unit with a recording present. False advertising. Finally, no more responses to my emails. Live and learn."
2,Software is bad news,"I've been working with their software for the last three days with little success. I have 3 hrs of my son's black belt test on the camera but can't get it to DVD. He successfully completed the 29 hour test and I'm spending more time with no success. Others have found the authoring program equally as difficult. Its just plain slow and you need to wait until the end of the process to find out it went wrong. The help at JVC said with a very rehersed tone ""You're the first person I talked to with this problem."" Yea right. The sad part is that he at age ten is the first black belt of his school's program, his instructors are as proud and elated as I, he is held as the example for others to emulate and the only footage is locked in this blasted JVC. VHS is a piece of cake compared to this nonsense."
1,"Bad Tech Support, Error Codes JVC GZ-MG-155","Bad Tech Support,I can't get the Everio software included to capture the video from the camera and record it on a DVD. I keep getting Error codes FF037303 and EOFD003D in PowerCinema NR, with no explaination of what this means. I called JVC, but they don't provide tech support for the software. I've tried installing it on three different Dell computers - Latitude and Dimension, running XP and it won't work on any of them. PowerCinema only has paid support, and won't answer my email support requests"
4,Just for John Q. Public,"Okay, well I don't usually write reviews, but I have to step in and call out John Q. Public. His reviews seem to be everywhere and are perhaps the most zealus, nonsensical ramblings I have ever read. If you cannot find a website with accurate information on comic characters, then you have not looked hard enough. The fact that Mr. Public suggests going to the movie theater to find out information on heroes belies his true ignorance and, quite frankly, stupidity."
3,"Damn, I wish I bought a different CD!","I was drawn to this CD after hearing Sophie perform on the One Hit Wonder Show called ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"". It evoked wonderful memories of the song, Damn I wish I were your Lover. Not being familiar with Sophie's less notable hits, I used Amazon's reviews to determine whether to purchase this CD or the Best of Sophie B. Hawkins CD. With the exception of two more tracks, I am very bored with this CD. I would advise getting the Best Of CD so you can at least enjoy the track, ""Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep""!! Amen!"
1,Sophie's debut wasn't so great,"""Damn I wish I was your lover"" is the best song on this debut album from Sophie. She's got a great voice and she sounds very emotional when she sings these songs, but for some reason I just couldn't get into the rest of the album."
1,Trite and over-produced,"I really tried to give this CD a chance, but the lyrics make me cringe. The over-the-top production on most of the songs sound ridiculous and highlight the weaknesses is Sophie Hawkins' voice. She sings in a whiny drone, as if she's constipated, and when she attempts to sound hip by adopting southern or urban black expressions, she sounds like a total phony. Many of her songs are unintentionally funny because they're so cliched. Sophie might have a few good songs in her, but they're not here. Her next album, ""Tibre"" is dull and irritating too. I wonder if she drives her record company crazy with all her constant bitching and poor sales."
3,Is that a Queen cover rip-off?,"That looks suspiciously like the cover photo from Queen's ""Killer Queen"" double live album. Is there a connection?"
5,Just good rock 'n' roll!,"I can't really give an opinion of how this band measures up against other worship bands since the last ""worship band"" I was into was early Stryper. But I can tell you this CD is the most interesting CD I have heard in a long time. It is unusual for a band to come along with a unique sound these days, but the Worship Circus pulls it off. At times they are very contemporary, but there are flashes here and there of days gone by. ""The Undiscovered"" is amazing and ""Glorify the Son"" is just too incredible for words. A band with a very bright future!"
4,Praise and Worship with the amps turned up to '11',"This record is just that--you won't find any of these songs on the ""Songs 4 Life"" TV special. rock 'n' roll praise and worship! I've seen these guys play live and they are indeed the real deal. This is great worship music minus all the sappy sugary music you'll hear in most churches.About the lack of a bass player - the keyboard girl plays the bass lines on a vintage Moog synth."
4,Great Value. Fast Service. Perfect for leveling floors,Typical adjustable column. Lots of wieght capacity in a small package. Standard tube thickness etc. Fast Service made me a repeat customer!
3,Flimsy but inexpensive,"I purchased 3 of these to aid in a releveling project on an old house. Since they are going to be in place for several months making slow adjustments, I didn't want to use my regular ones. As others have mentioned in their reviews of similar products, these posts come in several pieces and must be placed on very level pads or they will slip off. The threads are not acme type and must be well lubricated with grease before any heavy loading or the threads will spall or freeze up. The turning bar supplied is also very anemic and is likely to bend if trying to make adjustments under heavy loads. Still, for a low cost, light duty adjustable post they aren't bad. Just be aware of their limitations and don't expect them to perform as well as units like the JET models."
2,Good Message. Bad Package.,"This book was given to me by a friend after my father suffered a minor stroke. While it does have some decent information on alternative modes of treatment/therapy, I found it a convoluted read. Having been a writer and editor for more than 15 years, I find it difficult to believe that this book was even edited. I believe that the author, having suffered a stroke herself, made every effort to tell her story but the editing fell short. I would recommend it only to those with patience and only because it does contain interesting tidbits of information."
3,Good For Its Length.,"This book has depth and a few intriguing contradictions. This volume covers the period 400-1100. The Germanic tribes, the Slavs, Vikings, Picts, Britons, and Celts are all covered. Chapters 2-The Germanic Tribes In Europe, 3-The Anglo-Saxon Settlement Of England, and 6-The Viking Adventure were the most significant and well written. Their respective Mythologies, Archaeologies, and Culture are all given attention to varying degrees. Page 70 stands out as the foundation of the Middle Ages."
5,Teen Pop at it's Best,"SOUND MAGAZINE was the third Patridge Family album and it is said it had a more sophisticated sound compared to all the others. The creation of The Partridge Family was brilliant. Only David Cassidy and Shirley Jones really sang but they brought in other backup singers for a unique, easy to define sound. Bubble gum music? Yes, but quality pop also.It gets forgotten that David Cassidy really had a good singing voice. This set has the hits - BROWN EYES, RAINMAKER and I WOKE UP IN LOVE THIS MORNING but it is the other tracks that stand out more. This set isn't dated at all and each song is taken seriously and provides great pleasure. The opening ONE NIGHT STAND is amazing as is the truly soulful YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. SUMMER DAYS and LOVE IS ALL THAT I EVER NEEDED are also standouts.For all of you Partridge Family fans, this cd has wonderful remastering and sounds great. I grew up on this music and if you did too, give yourself a present and purchase this great cd."
5,Sound Magazine,I love music from the 70's and grew up watching the Partridge Family. I just love this kind of music.
4,Pretty Good!,"These aren't my favorite Partridge songs, but I love ""Echo Valley 2-6809""! I reccomend this to any Partridge fan!"
5,One of their best.,This was one of my favorites. Upbeat pop music. Took me back to my youth and many good memories. I recommend it!
3,"Sorry, but this is NOT Abbey Road!!!!!","This album has it's share of pleasant moments, but it's nowhere near the brilliance of Abbey Road or any other Beatles album!Those that grew up with this music may find it nostalgic. I find it astonishing that one reviewer said this was the greatest album of the 20th century! Ever heard of Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Elvis, Beatles, Glenn Miller, or Copland? I guess not."
1,Ick!,"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear here is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off."
1,"Mediocre, boring",These not very interesting arrangements become quite monotonous after a couple of hearings.
1,Caveat Emptor,"These arrangements brutalize the work of J.S. Bach. Unfortunately, in the Indie music category, there is a lot of chaff. In the words of Lloyd Bentson: ""Bach was a friend of mine, and Lars Eridkson, your no Bach."""
3,The Unicorn Treasury,"I purchased this book for my niece, she's 5yo. Loves unicorns, as we read the book we're disappointed that there aren't any pictures to accompany the stories. We do enjoy the stories."
4,Good deal,My son saw this and was so excited about cooking food on it. Was better quality then I expected.
5,Great BBQ,"My son does most of the cooking on the BBQ in his family, and his just 3 year old son loves to cook like Daddy. He even fixes the gas hose.This is well constructed. A good size for a small apartment and a 3 year old height. Great for symbolic play. He also has a table and chairs and a salad bowl, and enjoys ""cooking"" and ""eating"" meals with Grandma"
4,really cute,I was really looking forward to this for my 2yr old son but when it came in I was a little disappointed to find that the lights and sounds had a mind of their own and don't work consistently. Especially since that was the reason I chose this bbq over the others with more storage space for utensils and play food. My son really does love it tho and of course he doesn't care about the lights and sounds. For the price it was a great deal and with the amount of time he plays with it id say it was totally worth it.
5,Dental Hygiene,"Stop! You need to take care of your teeth! If you use this tool, then you will see just how much plaque is on your teeth before you ever brush them. Buy today."
5,Gums clean,These refills are great. They are not sold at the Rite Aide where I bought the whole new thing when the rubber tip was worn. I should have thought about online shopping earlier. A great spare part.
4,Good way to maintain gums,"My dentist recommended using the GUM stimulator to improve my gums. Using the stimulator has improved my gums quite a bit and hopefully help prevent gum problems. Not sure why but local stores like Walgreen, etc. stopped carrying GUM stimulator and refills. Thanks to this Amazon vendor for carrying the refills!"
3,Highly Discriminatory,"This DVD focuses primarily on the American and Russian skaters. Even when the Chinese pairs were ahead of the Americans, they only showed the Americans. The narrator speaks in a way that glorifies the Americans and Russians. The only reason why they showed Michelle Kwan was because she represents the USA. This world event is not exactly ""world"". They should have shown ALL the skaters because a DVD should be able to contain up to 7 hours. Certainly racist against Asians!!!!!"
2,Not good,Spongy stringing makes control over shots difficult. I wouldn't buy this product again. The discontinued FlexPoint 160 is a far better product
1,Worst squash racquet ever,"Don't buy this piece of rubbish. I have played squash for over 20 years and this is the worst racquet by a distance. Balance is awful, it is a dead head racquet. My wrist ended up injured for weeks."
4,Yet another overlooked Louisiana Metal Band,"Louisiana gets very little national resepect in the punk and metal history books, yet we've churned out some legendary stuff. This is an example of yet another band that should have been much bigger. Buy this album, you will be happy!"
4,Suprisingly REAL GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bleek drops a tight album. Better than i thought it would be.Its not a classic but its a Banger.Every track is tight.""Stay Alive in NYC"" is the best track. Album features hot appearences by Ja Rule,Jay-Z,Noreaga,and Beanie Sigel.Up there with Gza for album of the year.Worth the money!!!!!!!!Go buy this along with GZA's BENEATH THE SURFACE !!!!!!!!!Peace NB4Ever!!!!!!!"
5,Don't Hate what you can't see.,Memphis Bleek is the man with the master plan so don't hate what you can't see. This album is another one of the additions to this hip-hollocaust and you have to be on another level to feel it. But if you can't see it then just don't hate what you can't see.
3,Good but than got better,When I first got this album I felt that I had wasted my money. He sounds great with JAy Z on J's cd and on clue's lp but he is only decent on this cd. I must admit it did grow on me and now i listen to it every now and again. Not great but good if you love roc a fella get it otherwise back off.
4,Not for everyone...,"I have to admit that I do like this LP. It kinda grew on me throughout these years. Lyrically he does have his moments. Overall, this is the only record from him I think you should check out."
2,WHAT THE DEAL????,"THIS CD IS TOO WACK.THE REASON I GAVE IT TWO STARS WAS BECAUSE OF THE GUESS RAPPER JA-RULE,WHICH THE SONG IS ON BOTH OF THERE ALBUMS.SO THERES NO POINT OF ME EVEN PUTTING THIS WACK ALBUM IN MY CD DECK....THE BEATS ARE TRASH,YOU WOULD THINK THAT HIS CD WOULD BE OFF THE HOOK CUZ OF JAY Z..WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY RAPPERS COME HARD ON OTHER RAPPERS JOINTS...."
3,Is he the new and improved Jay-Z?,"Memphis Bleek looks at himself as the new and improved Jay-Z. As far as the general fans are concerned, he has the potential to be, but as far as this album goes, it doesn't seem he be will anytime soon. Unfortunetly, this album lacks the same presence that Jay-Z gives us with his records. Memphis Bleek does possess the same swager and infactuation with drugs, money, women and guns, but unfortuntely it lacks substance. No real standouts in this one, but the gems on this LP do keep the record spinning and have you listening to what this young man's all about, with some decent production work. Sorry Bleek, better luck next time!"
2,Memphis Bleek is Learning,"You have heard this guy from the Jay-Z tracks on Hard Knock Life, but those were Jay-Z's songs. Memphis Bleek is a young star. One song I liked was ""What you think of that"". Good beat. But the rest of the CD was not so good. It lacked lyrical and musical qualities. I'm not quite sure why ""Memph Bleek is..."" was his first single. I did not really like the song, but it was Ok. I gave this CD only two stars because one song does not complete an entire CD. He is a young rapper, and he is learning. Hopefully, his next CD will be better."
5,This CD is mad Tight,"Bleek is mad hot.Hottest CD by Rockfella in a while.Best CD I have. Buy this as soon as you can.Favorite cut ""What You Think Of That"""
2,Subpar hip-hop album.,"On paper you would think this album had the potential to be a hot joint. Rap's no. 1 sidekick the past year being guided by Jay-Z had many antcipating a posssible heir to the throne for '99. But after a few listens you realize that this debut from Memphis Bleek is a forgettable collection of uninspired music. Lacking little subject matter, Coming of Age depends on unoriginal lyrics and hooks that barely keep the listener's attention. For what it's worth, the album does not linger in complete mediocrity. Good but not great guest appearences from Jay-Z, Noreaga, Ja-Rule, Bennie Seigal, and Swizz Beats (production) does the album some justice. But overall M.B. appears to be still coming of age. Masir Tucker"
2,Could be worse,"This fails on almost all fronts, acting, setting, dialog, eroticism and plot, cute twist at the end gave it an extra star."
2,Forumla,"There's quite a number of vampire stripper films already out there; Blond Heaven, Vamps, Vamps 2 etc.This one follows the same formula. It's not any worse, but it does have some really stupid moments in it, especially the ending.Take for instance a vampire stripper goes out to a guys van to have sex with him and to feed. They're in the back of the van when she bits him he throws her off, jumps to the front of the van and begins to drive off. Why? She's still in the back of the van. You can't drive away from someone in the same vehicle!Why's an immortal vampire running a very small strip-joint, anyway? He should have heaps of money; having made a killing in long-term investments."
1,Never received the item from the seller (Woody's Books),"Never received the item from the seller (Woody's Books). E-mail correspondence with the seller was extremely aggravating as instead of addressing my concerns I would get ""canned"" responses. Almost as though someone picked a word out of my e-mail, determined it fit a specific response and cut and pasted the response from a FAQ list."
5,A supernatural mystery story combined with some romance.,"Fifteen-year-old Jansie is devastated when her older sister Tavia marries Silvan, the young man that both girls love. Jansie knows she will have to live her life without him, but she can't help being jealous of Tavia and longing for Silvan, even though she knows her feelings are wrong. When Silvan must travel away from home, on a journey that will last the entire winter, he invites Jansie to his remote estate to keep Tavia company while he is away. But an early snowfall delays Silvan's departure, and Tavia is haunted by terrible nightmares. Gilmer, who works for Silvan, tells Jansie about a local legend, the Hounds of Winter. Are the Hounds haunting Tavia? And why is Silvan acting so strange? Jansie must discover the truth, but will she be in time to save Tavia - and herself? I highly recommend this book to teens who enjoy stories with a mix of romance and the supernatural."
2,"Fabulous music, atrocious vocals.","I'd heard fabulous things about Lamb, and was blown away by the magnitude of the music itself. Beautifully layered sounds, with unique timing and styles makes for a really exciting listen. Then Lou, the vocalist, gets jealous and screams--no, wails like a BANSHEE is more like it--for attention like some kind of tortured child. Stick with Portishead, if you want some sincere vocals, or get this if you can mentally ignore the howling of this inhuman wannabe."
1,Stale Roast Lamb,"This clunky follow up to their smooth debut would best be served on a skewer, rather than endured on a stereo. It's obvious that they've run out of creative spark here; Most tracks offer pale echoes of previously charted territory. And ""B-Line"" has to be one of the most annoying songs of the year(Their trendy nod to swing, me thinks). They've sacrificed the jazzy/sultry/after-hours moodiness of their debut for radio friendly blandness. Much of what they're gunning for here is handled better by another act worth checking out--12 Rounds. Interesting sidelight--Their ""new"" label (Seagrams) has been pushing tracks mostly off of their first album on a promo video for this new album--a bad sign for sure."
3,still good,"i was glad to come to listen to their debut""lamb""(4 stars), which is no copycat of Portishead but has their own stlyle. this time ""fear of fours"" doesn't let me down either,."
3,Lamb is slipping up,"This album is great, yes, but it does not nearly compete with Lamb's self titled debut. Lamb was a very dark beautiful album and Lou sounded sexy and smooth. In Fear of Fours Lou sounds like she's holding back, almost like a child, and th music became more choppy less pretty and melodic. I hope they go back to what they did best, making 3am albums."
5,Truly amazing - as good as their debut,"Great music and great vocals. This is not just another 'drum & bass' CD, but an inventive, delicious and strong kind of music ... and they can do the same sound live ... A must have!"
4,A sound for your senses,"This CD makes you feel good. Her vocals hit far out octaves (reminiscant of Bjork) yet remain serene. The bluesy sounds intermixed with drum and bass are very catchy. The first CD was experimental (Gorecki is beyond words) and yes, some songs on this may sound ""mainstream"", but what's bad about that if they truly sound good. Buy it now!"
4,"great beats, great vocals, great album","I had to learn more the people behind such a strange video (b-line). Anyway, this album is different from their first but absoutly not a step down (they did not pull a gus-gus). Who wants a second album to sound just like the 1st anyway? I hope their 3rd is different yet. There are a lot of great and average songs. It's a must buy."
4,This IS a relatively good album.,"Anybody seen the ""B-Line"" video? It kicks my *ss. It's very weird, though. Anyhow, this cd is definitely worth the price. Those who cannot appreciate this cd obviously do not truly appreciate trip-hop. Any fan of Portishead needs to check his out. It does not disappoint."
3,Same name but unfortunately not the same sound,"I don't know what happened here. The first album was excellent with awesome beats beautiful ballards and overwall great song craft. Admittedly, the production quality is higher on this one, however, it sounds like they've run out of ideas. Very pretty, very shallow. And the lyrics? echh! They're better than this. I'm hoping that for the next album we'll see a return to their true sound. But for now, you can call them ""pseudo lamb"""
3,"Excellent Music, disappointing vocals","I was fortunate enough to see Lamb in concert in Seattle a few years ago during one of their tours. I was truely amazed at the quality of the singing and the incredible sound of their music. I immediately purchased their CD and became an instant fan.I purchased fear of fours hoping for the same type of sound. The music is really incredible... it has the same incredible beats, the same modern sound... but something was missing. Some songs sound as through the vocal have been distorted. Rather than the beautiful soft voice that was in the debut album, the lead vocalists voice sounds shrill and harsh. It's too bad, because her voice was so absolutely beautiful and pure in the first album.So... if you want a Lamb album, I recommend their first. This one just doesn't have the same musical quality."
3,NOT FOR SLIM,I was SOOOO sad when I got this and realized it wasnt for the SLIM! :( its a cool looking stand and for the price you cant beat it! but it comes in this horrible plastic packaging (that most toys come in) that you have to cut to get open so I cant even return it! Glad it was so cheap.
1,Not Suitable for 60GB,"This product is very slick looking and does increase the stability of the PS3 when in the vertical position. It is powered by a USB port but has a pass through port on the stand, so you don't lose any ports. I never did see my stand alternate between blue and red. It only illuminated in a blue color.The door to access the media slots on the 60GB system will not open when in the stand. It is really only good for the 20GB system."
5,space saver,"this stand not only creates more space but also helps your ps3 to cool down at a much faster rate than just laying flat and also helps reading game disks better. if u have a disk that ever gets stuck im sure you have grabed your console and moved it,taped it ,put it up on its end then game gets unstuck i never do this any more now that i have the stand its the best accessory i have bought for my ps3.radracer07"
5,PS3 glow station,Awesome for the PS3 and lights up blue; also has a small rack for at least one of the controllers and has other USB slots for plugging controllers in when needing to charge while playing.
4,is worth it....,I just bought this Playstation 3 glow vertical stand and let me tell you that this is one of my best purchases from this site.you really are going to enjoy looking at your Playstation 3 glow blue in the dark. i really recommend this item specially for the price.
5,Perfect!,This is a great product. Its got a sleek design and looks kool. It also have nice bright blue lights. There is a spot to insert the controller cradle so the cradle lights up blue as well! This is a great product and i do recommend!
4,Playstation 3 Stand,"I like the stand and it works well and seems well made. Mine however was a dud and did not light up as advertised but since I didn't buy it for any other reason than as a stand I didn't return it or care. If no one else complains I would think I just got the random bad unit. Has a snug, secure fit (its curved on one side to fit the curve of the playstation 3) and a plastic hook that you can use to hang a controller. As a stand its perfect probably just has a loose connection somewhere but I was not and am not concerned about the lights."
2,Not a great vertical stand.,"This vertical stand for the PS3 is not that great. The lights on either side cannot be seen when looking at the PS3 head on. If you own a 60 or 80 gig model like I do (60) it prevents you from accessing the memory card slots under the front cover, with is horrible. A great idea that that falls short."
1,doesnt work,the stand add stability to it but the LED lights do not work.... Its sad considering they say in the product lifetime warranty U_U
4,Media Door is accessible,The door IS accessible depending on how you place the PS3 in the stand. And the blue light is really cool!
1,dont buy you dont need it,this is just a rip off product got one as a present didn't need dont want it could not retun it to the store becouse a fam member gave it to me.it just uses your ports and dosen't do much for the ps3 just makes it look cheap have a nice day.
5,I highly recommend this!,"This stand works perfect for my ps3 fat 80GB system.Not only dose it display my ps3 wonderfully but it runs cooler.The blue lights all work and give a cool look.If your ps3 is in a horizontal position and seems to get hot,I recommend buying a stand that allows you to display the system vertically.I am very satisfied with this product,the base is wide and adds stability.A small price for a great investment.The stand plugs right into your ps3 usb port but there is one on the stand so that you don't lose any.There is an on/off switch to turn off the lights.I highly recommend this stand if you own the ps3 fat system.This stand is not designed for the ps3 slim system ."
4,Great Display Item,"Just got my glow stand ! Cool blue LED display,extra usb port ,loved the controller holster, really nice display , only drawback is thought it was for the slim ps3 little gap where it stands up but still a great buy"
5,Great price for a usefull product.,"You can ask for much more for $10 these days. The light looks great at night, the stand supports the PS3 well. It really adds so some class to the monolithic PS3. It gives back the USB port is uses and adds a some light to the dark console. If your looking for a cheap sexy PS3 stand you found it."
2,It will do.,only has two small blue lights on the front side. and it has extra power hole. its pretty lame and my on switch was funky. But i already ordered it so i have no choice. it still looks ok though. the only one i could find for the ps3.
1,this seriously is the worst buy,it is bad ok it doesnt fit right its way smaller than the bass of the ps3 and blocks the door from opening...... seriously? who makes something that bad its classafied by me as an epic failllllll
5,Then Along Came an Angle - an Inspirational read,I found this book to be sad and at the same time inspirational. To read the stories of miraculous things happening was a wonderful thing to me. I do believe that there are angels sent from God to help us when we need it. They speak to us for God. We don't always realize it at the time but He is there for us.I was touched and awed by how Julie organized and compiled all of these stories into one book. Some of the writers are easier to read than others but all are equally compelling and uplifting.
3,boring,this book was somewhat boring to me. i love angel stories but this one just didnt do it for me.
5,Clapton meets Coltrane,"Bill Connors is one of the most important, virtuosic and creative guitarists of our day... it's just that no one knows it!! Like Allan Holdsworth, he mixes lightning-fast arpeggios with unusual chordal voicings and off-kilter cadences. That which a mainstream audience might hear as cacophony is really a purposeful mission of spiritual celebration akin to what Coltrane was seeking to do with the sax in the 1960s. Tom Kennedy is one of the few like-minded bassists of the day (as was Jimmy Johnson with Holdsworth) who had the musical intelligence to follow suit with Connors' vision, and helped make this trio format not only viable, but hold-your-breath exciting. Unfortunately, Connors became disillusioned with the music biz scene, and abandoned his public art after his three poorly promoted Pathfinder/Evidence fusion releases, ""Step It"", ""Assembler"" and ""Double Up"". I still hope for the day when he considers coming back."
2,it does not fit the Master Mark IV Valve,I ordered two of this item and received them in a week. They are too big and do not fit my Master mark IV 1B1 Valve. I wasted the money on the two items and the shipping charge. I think the vendor should give the dimension of the item on the description to avoid this misfortune from happening again.
5,Stopped the leaks,"I just got the repair kit today. I had it installed in less than 10 minutes, needing only a pair of pliers. No directions were included, but none were needed."
3,Clarification for Posterity...,"A previous poster noted that the writer, Rupert Holmes, said that Timothy was a mule. This is incorrect - Rupert always claimed the song was hinting at cannibalism since his purpose in writing it was to create a song that would be banned, and therefore it would create its own publicity. The record's original label came up with the mule story - which was quickly quashed by Holmes when he was interviewed since he refused to play along with the label.Regardless, as a pop album from the early 70's, this isn't a bad go..."
3,An interesting sidenote to classic rock music,"While most folks will remember them for their one hit wonder Timothy, the real gem here is the song Tell Me Heaven Is Here. I originally got this on vinyl in the cut out bin for fifty cents many years ago, upon playing the LP I discovered that the real hit on the album was the song Tell Me Heaven Is Here, with it touching lyrics and short but very soulful guitar solo it easily becomes an addicting tune you will play again and again for many years to come."
5,Shades Of Old (High) School,"If you grew up or were in school in the 'Nawlins area in the early 1960's, Arthur Alkexander's music should bring back old memories; memories of sock hops, hangin' at the local Lotta Burger shooting pool, trying to be cool. If you're an early Beatles or Rolling Stones fan, check to see where they got ""Anna"" or ""You Better Move On"". He's one of the roots of Rock & Roll!"
4,Hurt soul,"At his best, there were few more emotionally accessible than Arthur Alexander. His ballads sound like the lyrics were penned on paper literally bubbled with tears. But although he had some fine humorous songs as well, he didn't have the aggressiveness it takes to drive one's art into the mainstream. This is what you listen to if you think that Otis Redding is too slick and crowd-pleasing."
2,"Lean, Mean and Necessary","First of all the Trenchcoatyuppies bring back fond memories oftop to bottom releases, meaning you can listen to the whole CD not just one hit song. Iggy Pop, Paw, Dead Kennedys all come to mind.What is truly impressive is the way they have captured the pointed hatred of terrorism without sounding trite or sensationalist. They have opened the proverbial Pandora Box of your own fears and insecurities, play this loud with the lights on, and believe me as this release continues to play, you will check the closets and keep looking over your shoulder"
3,Good but Flawed,"""This Is Next..."" ss not much more than fast-pased, punkish, angry rock. The songs all sound very similar--a thrashing electric guitar or two, and some fast-tempo drumming in the background; the lyrics are always gravelly and angry, save for a sarcastic Arabic impersonation in the interludes.What sets this album apart is obviously the subject matter. It's the only album I know of entirely dedicated to the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. On the plus side, it isn't tedious sappy ballad, nor is it political commentary. However, despite capturing some of the anger and rage of 9/11 well, it is somewhat one-sided. A little more variety would have made a good debut an excellent one."
4,Disturbing But True,"This Is Next... is fast and heavy. The drummer is wicked, the lyrics are wicked, the guitar is wicked, the vocals are wicked. The Bass isn't that great but all in all Trench Coat Yuppies are worth a listen."
4,You'll Be Impressed!,"I bought this camera to get me started in professional photography. The quality of the photos I can now take has Launched me into a new realm of photography.Things I like: CD Storage, 20x Digital Zoom, Clearity, lots of manual settings, manual focus is great,Things I Don't Like: Slow Shutter Speed, Poor flash (but usually don't need it anyway),Samples of this cameras ability can be seen at:[another website]All the photos there were taken by this camera."
1,Reliability Problems,"WARNING! I purchased a new MVCCD 1000 in February of this year. It recently crashed, with the message ""unable to initialize disk"". I am unhappy with the the reliability of the camera, as the camera was not dropped or abused in anyway.Potential users should be aware that Sony only has a 90 day policy to cover labor costs, but one year on parts. They have also been very slow about repairing the unit. I balk at paying $140 to ""repair"" a unit that is clearly defective.From the large backlog of work at the Sony repair facility, I suspect that many other users may have the same problems.I cannot reccomend this camera given its lack of reliability.CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!"
4,really a 3.5 star not a 4 star,"I agree with the first reviewer the delay is a killer for any action shots, and you can tell that the next model will address that problem. If it is in the cards Sony should include a night vision viewer for an idea of what the photo will look like in a low light setting. steve D, california"
4,Sony MVCCD1000,"This is my first digital camera, and I like the quality and clarity of the pictures that it takes. I also like the storage capacity of the CD media.My biggest concern is the size. It does not weigh more than your average 35 mm (probably less), but is a big device, and I have not been able to take it as many places as I could a smaller camera. The camera also comes very barren...no carrying case, and a minimal B&W phamplet for instructions."
4,Almost is good enough for me!,"I'm digitally challenged yet I opened the box and was shooting within a careful hour's worth of reading. A few more days pratice gave me the nerve to put Sony's Big Mama into the hands of my high school students. It's frustrating to see them learn in minutes what took me an hour to learn...but.. They did! And they started discovering features I hadn't yet mastered. I short, I love this camera! It's pricey, the delay on captured shots drives me up the wall, but it's the best thing I've seen. (I'm the envy of the ballcourt.. twice last week, professional photogs missed their shots while watching me wrangle this honey around.) Frankly, I waited on the technology until someone came up with adequate storage. Now I've got it. Sony-heads... get rid of the delay in capturing the shot and I'll trade this one in. You've got a great camera here!"
4,My Sony Mavica MVCCD1000 Digital Camera...Still is Best...!,"Although I have had my Sony Mav CD1000 for only a few months, I have learned several important things...It is very good for stills, but action shots are left better to chance. The shutter seems to be delayed about one second, therefore, your moving object will not be in the picture as you first saw it (in ""Still"" mode). Email format is good, while maintaining full JPEG file sizes. Still images are wonderful and the digital zoom is incredible. The cost of CD's is worth the trade whever you consider that you can skip the film processing. If you are wanting to ""GO DIGITAL"" and ""PAPERLESS"" the CD1000 is great. Data can be read by CDR-RW drives without ""Finalizing"" the disk...which saves time and space. If you really want to consider buying the CD1000, find someone who owns one, and take it out for a great day of picture taking. Thanks to Sony!"
5,My what a large camera,"Yes it's big. It's got a big 20X zoom lens and image stabilization. It's got big 8cm CDR's that permanently hold 160 or more 1600x1200 pictures. It also has a great battery that is good for hours of shooting. The LCD is a big 2.5 inches and the viewfinder allows framing good shots in bright sunlight. What I think is the most outstanding feature of this camera is the CDR format that allows endless picture taking without have to download to a computer. The blank CDR are cheap, I have found them for as little as $... each in tens. I think this camera will maintain a high resale value for years to come and become a coveted item."
4,A Very interesting story,"Madigan meets a charming stranger and becomes convinced he is her father who walked out on her and her now-dead mother many years ago. Now, living with her grandmother in a sleepy Maryland town, Madigan is determined to solve the mystery. Very exciting and suspenseful, and the issue of trust is explored here, too..."
1,Not a book for childern,"I have seen all the reviews written here. Maybe none of the adults have read this entire book, if they have I don't think they would let there childern age 9-12 read it. In this book the subject matter is not for kids. Unless you want your kids to think that the word TRAMP (which is what the grandmother calls the girl down the street because she ran off with the Mystery Man ""excaped convict"" and got pregnant) is the best way to explain this to a kid.I don't allow my 9 year old to use phrases such as""Tramp"" and ""What the HELL are you doing"" at home, and I don't want her reading anything that she can't repeat, without being punished for it. The choice is yours. This book is in the Library of my daughters Elementary school, and I will do all that I can to have it removed."
5,Perfect brush for tube bird feeders,"The Droll Bird Feeder Brush is long enough to clean tube bird feeders. I also use it to clean tall, slim flower vases. A winner."
4,Droll Yankee Bird Feeder Brush,"I haven't used it yet but I'm sure it will help to clean the new 30"" Droll Yankee bird feeder tube I also bought. I can tell you that I love the bird feeder. It is great to look out and see so many birds feeding at the same time and I don't have to fill it as often as my smaller feeder. I got a pleasant surprise one morning when I looked out the window and saw a whitetail buck having a snack. Can't get any better than this!"
4,Historical Fiction at its best,"""Louise de la Valliere"" - the middle portion of Dumas' epic novel ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" - focuses on the intrigues of the court of Louis XIV, but is not less enthralling than its companions. If you find it difficult to follow more than one major plot, this is not the novel for you. If you want only to follow the tale of D'Artagnan and his companions, this is not your novel either.If, however, you are open to becoming involved with new characters and delve into their plots, you will not be disappointed. I have no great love for the character of de la Valliere and the pawn she allows herself to be, but the players that surround her hold up her personality inaddition to their own and make the plots rich.""Louise de la Valliere"" is not a fast paced action thriller, but does not bore either."
3,The Plot of Jenny Kimura,"Jenny, who is a Japanese girl with an American father and a Japanese mother, is nervous about meeting her American grandmother in America. She is afraid that her grandma won't like her because she is Japanese. I thought the book Jenny Kimura by Betty Cavana was good, but lacked an interesting plot. This book is hard to get into if you just picked this book off the shelf. Betty Cavanas' descriptions and detail on the characters was very good. I rate this book 3 stars because of good detail and description on the country and descriptions of Japanese culture and tradition. Betty Cavanas' other books, like Stamp Twice for Murder, is a good book."
2,Not the original DVD,"I ordered this from Amazon because they often have a product at a little cheaper cost than the original company. The original company sells this item at a special price for 17.99 from Ickes web site. On Icke's site, they report that bonus features include Jim Marrs, Joshua P. Warren, Renegade Agent, and Icke's son. The DVD I received from Amazon has no bonus materials (one of the reasons I wanted the DVD)and states at the end of the DVD that "" this DVD is a work in progress"". I wonder if this is a pirated copy without the Bonus material. Also, the DVD did not play well. I had to watch it on my computer and even then had some trouble with it stalling. Buy from Icke's site if you want this DVD."
1,Your kidding...right?,If anyone thinks this book is the best they are fooling themselves. Obama is a closet Marxist and is NOT GOING to save this nation. This must be a joke.
5,"Droll Yankees Sky Hook - 52""","I had been looking for the longest skyhook I could find since I have to climb up to the moon to hang my birdfeeders in the trees surrounding our property. The Droll 52"" Sky Hook fits the bill nicely. Well made and I like the fact that they are aluminum and will last a little longer than the steel ones will, here, next to the ocean. They apprear to be quite durable. I hooked 2 of them together to get the feeders down to a reasonable height. The birds say Thank You and I say Thank You now that I don't have to drag the ladder out anymore."
5,KICKIN' AWSOME HARD CORE CHRISTIAN MUSIC!,"This album by GRYP is a AWSOME mixture of HARD CORE Variety.... if you LIKE KORN, or LIMP BIZKIT...YOU WILL LOVE THESE GUYS! I have seen them preform in concert and can assure you they are just as good if not better in CONCERT! If you are looking for a CD and are not sure what one you would like BUY THIS ONE AND I GUARNTEE YOU WILL LOVE IT! WHAT EVER TYPE OF MUSIC YOU LISTEN TOO YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GROUP GRYP!"
5,purchase this album,this album is not for fans of rap-core. nor is it for fans of strictly screamy hard rock. this band mixes in all styles into a whirlwind of blazing noise that will make you either want to jump or pump your fist. look for lots of guitar and vocal effects over phat bass lines and trip hop drums. I reccomend this album to any fan of hard music. but be ready for originality. this band is not a limp jr. or anything like that. very original. and on top of all the tight music.... the lyrics are awesome. I am waiting to see them live. let's just say that this cd is one of my top billings inside my cd carrier and also that the volume level on my player is raised when this cd is inserted. check 'em out. you won't be let down
5,A very Awsome CD!,"This cd is sooooooo good! If you like Deaftones, KoRn, or Limp Bizkit you will love these guys! Their lyrics are so down-to-earth. Deffinately a must have."
1,whaaaat!,"I almost couldnt believe what i was seeing when i checked out these reviews. I'm putting this cd on my big list of really bad cds with horrible lyrics, vocals, and music. Dont tell me i dont know my music because it sounds like they threw this cd together in a basement in the dark while they were constipated, but hey, thats my opinion. That squeaky little voice the guy sings in just gets really annoying. Anyway, I hate this cd and i threw it out a week after i bought it, I would give it 0 stars if I could. Theres much better music out there."
5,FINALLY! A hard band with a POSITIVE message!,"Yep, it's true--this band cand rock your butt off and not leave you wanting to hurt someone. These guys have a sound all their own! Imagine if you will the hard rap-core sound mixed with a little funk and some RIPPIN guitar parts (originality at it's best!) This band has created a new style. Check out ""Heal Me Back"" for some hardness, or try to listen to ""Against the Crowd"" without humming it for the rest of the day! Congrats, guys, on beating the others at their own game--hardcore with a positive message!"
4,GRYP-christian band with attatude,"Just a few words: this is a pretty good CD and i like it alot. they sound somewhat like korn. i probably wouldnt like them but they are local so i do. ""Against the Crowd"" is a awsome song so is ""Real"". If your a christian and into metal or just wanna hear some tunes that grow on you, buy this album."
4,There should be no Indecision on buying this album. BUY IT!,"This album is one of the best independently produced, I've heard in a long time. The sonics are excellent. The band is original, with a twist of some ""core"" you've heard before."
5,"Come on MGM, where is the DVD already!!?","This is by far one of the best films ever, perfectly blending and improving upon so many Greek mythological tales. Hamlin is perfect, Mrs. Bowker as Andromeda is hot, and Calibos, even though not a character from actual mythology, is one of the best villains of ALL time! I have no idea what critics are talking about when they say this is a ""kiddie"" movie. There is a tad of nudity, and quite a bit of darker themes woven in. And I cannot stand how people say that this is essentially a special-effects vehicle for Harryhausen's work. Remember, a script comes first without knowledge if it will ever be made, let alone who would be selected to create the special-effects! There are not too many ""monsters"" in the film either. Each one is there in a perfect form to provide very suitable transitions from one part of Perseus' quest to another. And where is the DVD (and it BETTER have some nice extras)!!??!"
4,"Clash of the Titans-""Original""","This is a 'Classic"" movie from the past that has captivated many young hearts. The ancient ""Gods"" of Greek mythologyare portrayed well. The Hero-Perceus, The Villian- Calibos, The Princess- Andromoder, Pegasus & Medusa are all there."
4,Good deal!,"I watched this movie as a kid and wanted to share it with my boys. They are 8 and 10 years old and they love it as much as I did! It is definitely a ""B"" movie but it is a great adventure. Definitely worth what I paid!!"
4,Clash of the Titans,This is a great resource for use in the classroom to demonstrate how the Greek gods interacted. I love it! The students enjoy watching the old animation.
4,clash of the titans.,Clash of the TitansIt is an excellent film and very well done. it brings the myth to life and will give you images that will stay with you the rest of your life. it is dated by the use of special effects but considering the fact that that was then and we are far advanced it is well worth seeing and owning. i highly recogmend it. Please buy and have some fun.
1,In spite of nice packaging...,This cannot possibly be a Blu-Ray disc. The quality is the worst I've ever seen - I had to stop watching after only 10 minutes because it was so grainy you can't even tell what's going on!!!
1,Great movie but the conversion to Blue-Ray is terrible!,"The only ""actor"" ever to steal a movie from the greatest Laurence Olivier is the mechanical golden owl in this movie. Charming and enchanting from beginning to end is this great movie! But the conversion to Blue-Ray is very poor, grainy, blurry, and the background often looks pasted on. A real shame for this movie is timeless and far superior to the 2011 remake."
5,Clash of the Titanks,"The movie arrived promptly, before I even expected it to. It was well packaged and I can't wait for my mom to open it for Christmas!"
4,Good film. Titans?,"Since this film is from the year 1981, naturally, the first thing one would notice would be the special effects. They are humorous at best. But if you can look past the special effects, you would realize this film is actually quite decent. For it's time it's got good acting and writing. I definately recommend this one to anybody interested in Greek mythology. I actually was interested in it because of God of War II, in which there is a battle against the main character of this movie. The only real complaint i have is, i guess with the title. Clash of the Titans. It is referring to Medusa and the Kraken. Both of which are in fact NOT TITANS. So the title makes no sense at all. They refer to the two of them as titans, when they are not. But other than that one relatively minor statement, it's a good film. It's worth a download, a rental, or a purchase. However you want to [legally] obtain it, it's not a bad film at all."
3,Needs to be touched up a bit,"I know some might find it upsetting, but this film would look better if the effects were reshot, this film's effects are dated big time, why it didn't have better effects to begin with is a mystery to me, films like STAR WARS,EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,ALIEN,SUPERMAN,FLASH GORDON,BATTLESTAR GALACTICA,& RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK came before it and had superb special effects, maybe MGM did not want to spend the money, but it would have played out better i think, As a kid i liked it, as an adult it is hard to say, it has a mythical story about ancient Greece & is interesting to watch the story unfold, everyone is cast perfectly, but the effects really should be polished, that is my only problem with this film, if you want good storytelling, its a winner, if you want superb special effects, you will be disappointed big time."
1,DVD-Clash of the Titans,Very disappointed! The DVD skipped continuously throughout the movie. I was trying to show it to my class who is studying mythology. I had to change my lesson halfway through because it was so interruptive. There wasn't any instructions for returning it either.
1,Oh please!,God I hate this movie. The [bad] special effects (if you can call them special) make this film about as entertaining as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. And the acting - B movie caliber. I think I have seen better acting on Jerry Springer. I cannot believe they would waste time and money re-releasing this horrible piece of Hollywood!
1,Nudity definitely NOT for Kids and Families,I was SHOCKED as a teenager when I saw this movie in the theatre by the nudity which was NOT brief or appropriate. Pass on this one.
5,Great classic,If you like the new one give this one a try! I've been a fan from the first time I saw it.
5,Clash Of The Titans,"This is the original revision of the classic Greek mythological drams about Perseus. True it is not the classic tale brought to the big screen, but, it is still well worth the price. For a 1981 film the effects, while cutting edge at the time, may be lacking for some modern film fans. The story and cast still hold up against the test of time. Well worth the watch. Clash Of The Titans is a modern classic. The story is exceptional and the cast excellently chosen."
4,Just as I remembered.,"Saw this movie years back and after seeing the new version, I missed this one. Although corny, it includes a lot more mythology and has a more interesting plot. Had to include this to my blu-ray collection."
2,Crappy transfers SUCK!,This is the same issue I have with one of my favorite guilty pleasures...DEATH BECOMES HER. It's pretty sad when your VHS looks better than the DVD. Hopefully the release of the remake will produce a better transfer of the original!
2,I forgot how poorly this was written,"I bought this but regretted it. Not Amazon's fault. I liked Ray Harryhausens movies from when I was a kid, but this one had a horrid screen writer and crappy director. I gave it away, it's just too stupid to watch again."
3,I'd say 50/50....,"I remember watching this movie as I was growing up. Granted, the special effects are cheezy and the picture quality sucks,but, this IS after all an OLD movie. I do like the overall outcome of the movie though. I think if you are a fantasy lover, you may at least want to give ""Clash of the Titans"" a chance."
5,Love,"Who doesn't like to revert back to childhood when you watch a great movie with friends and each one of you gets to be a character in the movie (I got to be Andromeda). Takes you back to a time when life was more simple, the only thing you worry about is going to school and going to the pool at the middle school in the summer, and the mall and movies on the weekends."
2,Clash of the Titans blue-ray,"The Preview movie had audio, but the movie itself had no audio would be great to repurchace this movie when they have fixed the audio issue."
3,Classic deserves better treatment.,"This is one of those films that just hit me during childhood and stuck with me through the rest of my life. Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion creation is timeless and always a delight. The scenes and stories are moments that will stick with children.This would be a 5-star film, but the dvd is cheap. From the start you know you're in trouble with the cheap cardboard box. As others have noted, the transfer seems...off. It was a delight to hear Ray give a short background, but this is a film that deserves much more.Apparently they are in the process of filming a ""remake"". While i'm disappointed to hear that(I think the original holds up just fine), perhaps with the renewed interest and publicity they'll re-release this one in a better form. Fingers crossed."
4,Clash of the Titans,I needed this movie fast because we were talking about Greek Mythology. I received this movie just in the nick of time! Great job!
4,"A Good Movie, But It Doesn't Have The Story Straight","The movie Clash of the Titans was wonderful but imaginative.I liked the movie very much even though some of the movie wasn't what the Greeks believed.For instance Perseus didn't meet Andromeda until after he cut off Medusa's head, and the whole purpose of cutting off Medusa's head was because the king of Seriphus told him to.The Titans were not even monsters they're gods that were put into Tarturus by Zeus."
3,A classic,We bought this movie after our kids got excited when they saw a preview for the remake. We wanted to show them the original.
2,What do you consider a keepcase?,"I am curious of what is called a keepcase. I received this movie in a regular plastic case, nothing added about the movie or how it was made. Nothing to consider this a keepsake. Please advise what you call a keepcase?I love the movie. I would like to know if this will be rereleased with updates to the color, etc?"
1,"Great Movie, Terrible Blu-Ray","I've owned Clash of the Titans on DVD for years and was excited to see it come out in blu-ray with much promise of a brilliant new transfer. What I got was half the film with such bad snow that I thought I was watching a movie on some old TV with rabbit ears. Terrible transfer. Did anyone who made this blu-ray actually watch it when they were done? And did they think that this was okay given the vast quantities of superb blu-ray movies? While I struggled through the movie and watched the extras, I thought to pop in my old DVD and found it was far superior in quality to the new blu-ray. Warner should be ashamed for attempting to foister this junk on their fans. The only reason I am keeping this is the nifty little book included with it, and the extras with Ray Harryhausen. I'm thinking about putting the DVD into the blu-ray case and being happy with that."
1,Clash of the Titans Blu-Ray (English) DTS-HD Master Audio,"I currently own a DVD copy of, ""Clash of the Titans."" Last week I saw that the original movie was released in Blu-Ray so I purchased a copy.Video Transfer. As others have noted- HORRIBLE! So much grain that it's a distraction.Audio (English): DTS-HD Master Audio is hardly audible. French, Spanish, etc. etc. is just fine- loud and clear.Note: Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (English) DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 PERFECT and 300 [The Complete Experience] (English) Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Audio PERFECT.Gear: (Blu-Ray:) Pioneer BDP-51FD, to (HDMI:) Audioquest HDMI-1, to (Processor:) Pioneer VSX23TXHAll firmware is up to date.Verdict: If you still have the original DVD keep it. This Blu-Ray copy of Clash of the Titans is not worth the step up. In fact, it's a step down. If you've never owned the movie, it's a very good story. Just do not expect much from this Blu-Ray copy."
2,Hi def ?????,I love the old Ray Harryhausen films but that's not what I'm going to talk about. I re-bought Jason and the Argonauts as well as this one on blu-ray and I'm quite dissapointed. Both don't look any better than my standard def. I mean I have older films than this on blu-ray that look so sharp and clear. A waste of money.
5,Harryhausen at his best,"Classic storytelling, handsome heroes (oh, that Harry Hamlin), fabulous special effects, and a whole pantheon of Gods and Goddesses, with their quite human foibles - this is a movie you want to own so that you can watch it over and over again. Ray Harryhausen at his best!"
2,The Worst Blu ray quality I've ever seen !!!,"First of all I know I should do it more but I very, very rarely leave reviews. (I know I should to help others)However when I watched this movie I had to!! I saw this movie at the theater. Had it on VHS. Have it on DVD. I love the movie!Wish I hadn't spent the money to buy it on Blu ray though! The quality is so ""POOR"" I can't believe they would release something like this!I have over 1200 DVD's and almost 700 HD/Blu ray movies. This is by far the ""WORST"" quality of all based on what it's supposed to be!If you own the DVD and are thinking about buying this blu-ray, do yourself a favor and don't! The picture on your DVD is probably better!This is the biggest rip off for the dollar spent (because of the blu-ray quality) of any movie I have ever bought!!!"
4,Why is there no dvd for this classic film?,"This is one of the greatest films of my childhood, but I dont want to buy it on vhs, I want it on dvd, and its not avilable"
4,The Original Clash of the Titans,I not a fan of remakes. I ordered the original Clash of the Titans after seeing the remake and not liking it as much as the first movie. Of court the special effects of the second movie are much better but there is something about the campy low budget first one that I can't resist.
5,Clash of the Titans,This was a movie I watched over and over again. I loved every minute. My favorite part was the owl.
3,80s mythology classic - almost,"I first watched ""Clash of The Titans as a child and recently watched it again on television. It was slightly dated but still a great film. Ray Harryhausen's special effects were as stunning as ever. The Medusa scene still stands out.My one real complaint (and the reason I'm giving it 3 stars) concerns the gratuitous nudity. The version I seen showed Perseus' mother nursing him and a full-frontal shot of her strutting along the beach. There were also completely unnecessary shots of Andromeda in the bath. Both of the above scenes added nothing to the story, the sole purpose was titillation. Unsurprisingly, there was no such male nudity. I had planned to show this to my niece but I just don't think it's appropriate."
1,DVD LEGACY IS HORRIBLE!!! DON'T BUY INTO A SCHEME!,"They shouldnt' get any stars for anything. I am very disappointed in DVD legacy's manner in conducting business with their customers. Not only do they fail in customer service, I also never got my dvd. There was no reimbursement, nor was there any reply in the many emails I served them to fix the problem. My dvd is still not here, it's been over a month, and I have no sympathy towards a company that does not care about customer satisfaction. Please find a worthwhile company that is professional and doesn't steal from their customers."
1,Complete Failure of a Remake,"This was one of my favorite movies growing up. I don't even know how they give it the same name. Artistic license is one thing, but almost all of the original plot was completely changed. Character development was absent - what a disappointment. I have been going on and on to my kids about seeing the movie - they took me for my birthday. Luckily I purchased the download and they can watch the real thing."
1,Rated PG??? I DON'T THINK SO. BEWARE TEACHERS!,This movie is rated PG. I previewed it the day before showing it to my 7th graders and it has female nudity--female without her top on--full view of both boobs. Thanks a lot! I can't show this to my kids in class. What the heck. I purchased it for nothing--unusuable.
2,Mythological,"I am neither a fan of mythology OR claymation. I was curious about this movie, because of Harry Hamlin's role. Even though it was filmed only a year before MAKING LOVE, I found he looked so much younger as Perseus than his Maguire characer in Making Love."
5,Classic Mythologic Saga!,"This movie includes most of the major greek mythological characters and stories, and uses fabulous old-school special effects to bring them all to life. I used to love to watch old movies like the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor, and old Japanese faves like Godzilla, and this flick uses the same somewhat-cheesy but super fun style to bring Pegasus, Medusa, and other beasties of Greek mythology to life.The cast is great, too. My faves are the young, hunky Harry Hamlin, and a much younger Maggie Smith.This movie's been a favorite member of my collection for a long while, and if you like mythology, epic adventure, and/or classic creature movies, you'll enjoy this one for sure!"
4,Clash of the Titans,"I like myth, even if it isn't an accurate retelling. I saw this movie when first released in 1981. The images have stayed with me. So anything the commits itself to long term memory must be worth it. Don't use clash of the titans, to study mythology. See it because you want a good popcorn movie. Pure entertainment for those of you that have little one there is brief nudity. However it's nothing shocking and fits with story."
4,"Great Movie, but Warner Bros..Get Rid of Cheesy Snap Cases!!","Clash of the Titans is a great movie, and I'm so glad that it is coming out FINALLY on DVD. I remember seeing this for the first time when I was a kid and just really enjoying the film. All the monsters look great, and Madusa especially should look like she had a makeover on the DVD. Also, there seems to be some nice extras which I'm looking forward to checking out. However I was disappointed that it was Warner Bros responsible for Clash of the Titans because I knew then that this great movie was coming in a cheesy looking Snap Case. C'mon Warner Bros get with the program. I, along with many people that I know, hate those things, they are akward looking and just look plain cheap. They definitely don't look half as nice as Keep Cases. A petition should be made to make them change this."
4,Great to share with a new generation,"My sons, who are now grown men with sons of their own, always enjoyed Clash of the Titans when it was on television. I was delighted to find it to purchase on DVD recently. Now my grandson likes to watch it with me, the difference being that we can watch it whenever we choose. The story is still compelling to me, my grandson has developed an interest in mythology, and he goes home enthusiastic to talk with his Dad about a movie they both enjoy. I have younger grandsons coming up, so this DVD will get a lot of use."
1,Poor resolution and sound:(,"Great Movie, But surprised at the quality of the Blu-Ray! One star is even too much. Also where is the sound on the movie itself? The special features and new Clash of the Titans 2010 preview has sound, but not the movie. They need to re-release this and take time doing it so we can really see Hi-Def in all it's glory. This is VHS quality, if that."
1,Transfer to Blu-ray is HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this movie but the Blu-ray transfer is HORRIBLE. I'm serious, it's awful as awful can be. Some scenes are OK but others are so grainy it is embarrassing. Straight disrespectful that they let this get to the consumer. Warner Home Video should be completely ashamed of themselves for this abomination. If you can't do a good transfer just leave it alone. Just buy the regular DVD and let your Blu-ray player and HD TV upgrade the DVD. It will be so much better. Not much more to say about this. Buyer BEWARE. You will be disappointed. Not worth it AT ALL. Anyone who says the Blu-ray is good is telling a flat out LIE. Trust me. From a honest movie watcher."
5,Fascinating Special Effects,"I saw this movie when I was 5 years old and as a child was fascinated with the special effects and until today it is my favorite fantasy-adventure movie. The story is romantic and Andromeda(Judi Bowker) and Perseus (Harry Hamlin) are wonderful as lovers. The special effects are unique and it's all tied to the Greek mythology. Medusa's head of snakes, the sea monster, scorpions, vultures, statues that talk, sea monsters,etc. I always wondered how the special effects back in the early 80's were so good and so realistic and today with all the technology I don't see movies that are as well done. The movie is a great romance and the story is well written and I learned alot about Greek mythology from it."
4,"Clash, bad edition.","If you own the previous edition of this on dvd, you wont need this one; its virtually the exact same version. i bought this edition expecting the audio and picture to be at least marginally better. but no, youre not missing anything if you own the previous dvd. i think the special features are even the same. its just a fancy new cover people!"
2,Blu-ray not worth it,"This review is for the Blu-ray edition of this movie and should not be mistaken for the movie itself. I rented the Blu-ray to see if the quality improvement was worth the purchase, it was not. The transfer from film seems to be from a worn copy there are obvious scratches and grainy appearance. The DVD version is cheaper and has the same quality.The movies is still a classic and is one of my favorites."
3,"The movie is OK, but the blu-ray is a studio cash in","This new release is just the same as the old dvd.Same print and transfer upconverted for blu-ray, so it's a rip off by the studios.That being said a few of the bigger scenes look a bit better, and its a pretty interesting but not entirely successful movie. Hamlin, like the little figurines Zeus plays with, is wooden in his role.Harryhausen and his creations are the true stars of his movies, and he does some pretty good work in this one. But I think its variation of different creatures and their locations were a bit out of place and messed with its overall continuity and feel."
4,Good movie,"This is my favorite movie based on mythology. The acting was really good. The Medusa scene was very suspenseful. If you are a fan of mythology or stop-motion animation, then you'll love Clash of the Titans."
3,"Flawed, but a good rainy day flick.","This was my first stop-motion experience, and 'Clash' has its charms. The pacing was a little off, but even this had its lazy-day charm as well. The acting was okay, nothing really noteworthy. But in reality, you don't watch this for for story or acting. You watch this for the fantasy/adventure elements, and on this it delivers.Side note, PQ on blu ray is incositant at best. Very grainy."
3,It really took me back,"I used to watch this movie a lot when I was a child. I thought it was so cool. I guess a lot has changed over the years. The graphics are not very good & overall, it's a little cheesy, but it really took me back. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,"languages, bonus features,","I have not many things to say except the movie is fantastic and made in a pre-computer area. The Stop-Motion effects are incredible - made by the Stop Motion Master Ray Harryhausen.The bluRay Disc is codefree and contains also a german soundtrack + subtitles.Hm, for the bluRay would be better to get more Bonus materials but well... it contains a sneak peak for the new ""Clash of the Titans"" version with a few behind the camera scenes.Co-Stars are Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, Ursula Andress."
4,A Classic,"I remember watching this and loving it as a kid. As cheesy the animation is, it's still a fun watch. A quick note on watching it with kids though; although this is a PG movie, there is some brief nudity."
5,From VHS to DVD,"After watching this movie with my Latin classes on a 26"" TV for years, I loved the DVD projected onto a big screen. It was great for comparing the Perseus myth to this Hollywood version."
3,A Very Good Fantasy Film,"Even though this film got an okay rating by critics, i would say this is one of the best kind of Hercules type of story. The film has good special effects. It is about a Hercules type person having a journy to help a princess. Meduessa is cool. The two headed dog looks fake. The monster at the end of film is the best. I would of given this film 4 stars but, it was not Ray Harryhausen's best."
2,Okay,"I was pleased to get the DVD as I have been trying to get it for teaching Greek Mythology, but I thought the actual packaging of the DVD rather poor especially for transferring to and from my class. The disc is not properly protected in my opinion."
4,Ride a Proud Horse,"I liked this book- Morgenroth writes books that you want to read cover to cover. A girl struggles to make a life for herself and her father, and is really forced to grow up and become an adult because her father refuses to. Lots of horsey details but very good character development too."
5,my SF go to book,"I bought this in SF in 70's and still use it as a reference when some one in my family says ""I took the dog to Fort Funston beach"". I live in Ohio, so I want see where they've been. It is a beautiful paperback, 8"" by 8"", really artistic."
2,"Great band, great technical musical talent and creativity!","Although I rate this first album of theirs low, the second is in my 5 most favorite of the dacade. Its great to hear so much creativity from a band that uses only Drums, piano, and bass; that comment from a guitarist! Electricity is rampant in every song. I couldn't get the second out of my CD player for a month! When can we get the third album???"
5,Medeival meets rock - I want it back,"Gryphon mixes medeival instruments and rock music, and then stirs in a bit of humor. I can't wait for this to be re-released."
4,They sound like Farquhar,Farquhar is a very similar sounding band with XTC like song stylings mixed with math-prog and punk. Its an addictive combo. If you like this definitely get Farquhar's CD too.
4,is this the missing link!!!!!!!!!!!,well to me punk kind of all ways was against progessive rock as far as i can tell .but being a little older and wiser i think the two merge very nicely. some years past i went threw a fugazi phase ans also some years later i went threw a king crimson phase.....this album is like listening to red(king crimson)and in on the kill taker(fugazi)and jaw box and a little minutemen all at the same time.....its great some of my favories are here but i guess me being a musician i should think of another formula for my band now(haha)any ways a great album one of the best for late last year..so get it and youll be happy!!!!
4,totally killer,"i don't really have to much to add to what other people have said. i absolutely had labeling a bands genre so i'll basically just say that these dudes totally love jazz and indie rock. this is intricate and powerful and doesn't bore you at any point. ""cut self not"" is arguablly the best opener on any album i've ever heard.if you like faraquet check out the medications. read the reviews on amazon then get it thru dischord."
4,so so good,"I saw these guys in grand rapids a while ago with burning airlines and I've been hooked ever since. I picked up a four song split they did with a group called akarso there and atempted to get friends into it with little success. The inventive guitar lines and the use of strings and horns along with ever shifting beats make the view from this tower one of my favorite records of the past few years. Every song is pretty much picture perfect (I don't dig a song for friends and me as much though) Kerrang! even gave it a great review despite the fact that they usually promote crap. It's not music for every occasion and not everyone digs it but if you're into stuff like burning airlines, jawbox, fugazi, et al. You should enjoy it immensely."
4,Ex-llent video for portraying a general view of duck hunting,"Grits Gresham is a gentleman hunter. You can expect lots of action but little in the way of indepth ducking tips. You will get a look at different types of duck hunting. Grits hunts in flooded fields, marshes, sloughs and a hunting preserve where ducks are released. There is nothing which may diminish the sport of duck hunting in this video. Everyone is well mannered and knowledgeable duck hunters. This video is well suited for viewing by hunters and non-hunters alike."
4,Wonderful songs by Ty and Doris of Girlyman,"This CD has gorgeous harmonies and great lyrics. ""Sometimes"" and ""Drawn"" are the best tracks. Since this CD, Ty and Doris have joined with Nate Borofsky to form the incredible new group Girlyman. Girlyman is becoming very popular, and this Garden Verge CD is becoming scarce. Get it while you can."
5,Sweet and hard-hitting urban folk,"I listen to SHADOW OF A HABIT walking around New York City, and the opening riffs and lyrics of the songs get stuck in my head all the time when I'm not listening to it -- they're witty and raw without being cynical, and gorgeously lyrical without being sentimental or unsubtle. The Garden Verge might appeal to people who love the Indigo Girls or Ani DiFranco or Jonatha Brooke, but their sound is all their own. The opening track (""Shining Through"") is soaring and charmingly tentative at the same time, and ""Universal Kiss"" is one of my new favorite songs -- it expresses the passionately ambiguous emotions of a new relationship with a sort of gritty eloquence. This track alone is definitely worth the cost of the album. What a great find!"
4,"good, good!","This book is GREAT. The only reason of why i only gave this book four stars is because the content of the book seemed a little far-fetched for weak-minded humans (like myself). The ability not to like anybody, relieve yourself from anger and such, seem a bit too difficult for me to do, although after reading this book i felt compelled to try it (it only lasted about 2 days).I strongly reccomend this book."
4,Freddie Will Live 4Ever,"As long as there are humans and electricity on this over congested earth, Freddy's voice will be heard loud and clear, and that is a plus. The passion and fun of this collection is worth listening when the world seems such a funked place. Lond Live Freddy..."
3,Nice but not the best,"All of this is Mr. Bad Guy and Barcelona and a EP style disc of a few other rare songs. Nice booklet, but I wish I knew Barcelona was part of the package before I purchased because I probably would have just purchased Mr. Bad Guy. If you a looking for an ultimate Freddie Mercury discography of his solo efforts go for Lover of Life, Singer of Songs. Get the DVD also of Lover of Life Singer of Songs, you will be glad you did."
3,Freddie Repackaged,"I was happy to hear the new remastered quality on these songs. I liked the booklet that comes with this too. Barcelona, I was disappointed to see that it is NOT remastered, they used the 1992 remaster, and that was 8 long years ago. It's basically just Freddie's music repackaged, like Queen's has been over the last ten years via Hollywood Records. But we have to buy these CDs because we are trapped. We love Freddie and Queen too much!"
4,What more can you say it's Kiss,"Great Cd, the song just is not Kiss, you can tell right off the bat it was not written by Kiss, because it has no edge, most of the tracks are great, the AC/DC remake just plain out sucks!! Manson needs to learn to sing and AC/DC should file a law suit. But as for the rest it is a great cd, i would highly recomend buying it, just skip track 6. Kiss I hope the Rumors aren't true that this will be a farewell tour, you guy are the greatest!!"
4,Classic Rock like you've only remembered.,"It seems that now a days, Rock and Roll aint' what it used to be. Sure there are those artists who try to keep it alive. (Lenny Kravitz, Marylin Manson, Korn, KISS) But we simply have fallen away from our musical roots. Thank goodness this movie and soundtrack are being released now. To remind us. Detroit Rock City Soundtrack has gathered the best there is in Rock and Roll (Including KISS) and put them all togethor on this hit CD. If the thrill of classic Rock doesn't move you, then the new single by KISS should. Buy this CD now to hear it."
2,Heard em all before,"If your a fan of these songs you already have the originals, which are the best versions on this disc, even though they all are dated. The new versions are all have little or no energy. That's unusual with Marilyn Manson and Pantera on an album. Disappointing at best. The only reason it got 2 stars was because all of these songs were great in their time."
3,Good Effort to Rock,"From the track listing, this looks like a potential killer-rock album. It rocks...but, sadly, not hard enough! A couple of good interpretations here. The opening track from Everclear is a good high-powered starter. Manson's version of AC/DC's 'Highway to Hell' is interesting. Unfortunately, it lacks the rockability of the original. It is the original songs here that still rule the album. Songs like 'Detroit Rock City', 'Iron Man', 'Running with the Devil', 'Shout it Out Loud' are good examples of classic rock for the new generation of rockers. However, the greatest disappointment is Kiss's new 'Nothing Can Keep Me From You'. A very 'un-Kiss' song. And it sounds too much like Aerosmith's 'Don't Wanna Missa Thing' (both written by Warren). I tried to shut my ears off to the lyrics and sing 'Don't Wanna Missa Thing' to the music of 'Nothing Can Keep Me From You'. And guess what? Most of the parts fit in nicely!!!"
4,Who made this list?,"There are multiple errors on this soundtrack, because if you have ever seen the movie you can tell they are all the original songs... in which case i'd like to point out the errors. Thin Lizzy not Everclear sings ""The Boys Are Back In Town"", Ted Nugent not Pantera sings ""Cat Scratch Fever"", AC/DC sings ""Highway to Hell"" not Marilyn Manson, and The Donnas most certainly do not sing ""Strutter"" the band that the movie was made after sings it.... KISS!!! I don't know who listed this soundtrack but they are pretty dumb to screw all those things up."
3,90's artists mixed with the 70's.,"I liked the newer versions of songs on here like the donnas doing stutter and such but I really enjoyed the originals more. But it's great to have the runaways original song on this cd too. The movie was pretty cool in my book even if the lead character tries to steal a ticket from someone. Which put me off but the great music they played in the film soundtrack was better as one reviewer pointed out. Because thin lizzy was thin lizzy and most bands do a better job than cover songs do. But this is still a good cd with some good songs on it. Kiss puts a new ballad on this but should have put a new rocker on it too. Anyways , if you are a kiss fan you need this one in your collection. And if not, it's still a good cd to own because it's got good music on it."
5,Elevator Song,"First, great soundtrack. Love the movie. I was a teenager in 1978, when the movie is set. This was my kind of music (mostly). Thanks to the reviewer who made the complete list. I just watched the movie and tried to make the list myself. There were a few I couldn't make out so I got them from your list. The song in the elevator is Black Superman-'Muhammad Ali' by Johnny Wakelin & The Kinshasa Band. Not to nitpick, but some songs weren't out 'til 1979. Like Highway to Hell by AC/DC and Escape (The Pina Colada Song) by Rupert Holmes. It was the last #1 song of the 70's and the first #1 song of the 80's."
3,same ol' KISS songs with a few other classic tracks.,If you love KISS than you already have like 5 CD's with Detroit Rock City on them. The new ballad from KISS at the end is nothing spectacular.Pantera does a great job with Cat Scratch Fever. Not a horrible CD at all - just average. Probably better for casual fans of KISS or those who thrive on 70's classic rock in general.
5,This CD Rules Baby!!!!,This CD is really great! It has alot of great songs on it. If you buy it you will be amazed on how good it is! I love Detroit Rock City....I watch the movie almost every day...So of coures I love the music they put on the Soundtract! C-Ya-Laterz
3,looking for name of song not on soundtrack,"I like the music of this soundtrack and the movie, but there was one that was not on. Can anybody tell me what the name of the song was and who it was by, it was in the beginning or around the beginning of the movie when the kid is getting off the bus? It's a cool rock song that I've heard on a classic rock station a few times but I never figured out who it was. Please if someone can tell me, e-mail me.Thanks!"
4,"Great soundtrack, buuuuuut....","Lots of great tunes I grew up on, but I am VERY disappointed that UFO didn't make the soundtrack. Two of their songs were featured in the movie, and Lights Out should have definately been on the album. Oh well."
4,"Crappy movie, great soundtrack","So Detroit Rock City was a bomb and deserved to be with its fart jokes, pimply-faced, skinny guy stripping scenes and all. But the soundtrack actually has a few highlights.Everclear's opening track is probably my favorite cover of all time, I can't even listen to Thin Lizzy's ""Boys Are Back In Town"" anymore without being reminded how much better Everclear did it. But Thin Lizzy's classic ""Breakout"" never sounded better.""Cat Scratch Fever"" by Pantera is very faithful to the original, but the growl in Phil Anselmo's voice gives it a great edge.The Donna's version of ""Strutter"" is upbeat and fun, but not great.The other two cover's by Marilyn Manson and Drain STH are slow and dull.I almost wish this album was all covers, because the other tracks you pretty much hear on classic rock radio everyday anyway.But I say pick up a cheap used copy, if for nothing else than Everclear's stellar contribution-think of it as a single, why not pay 5 bucks for a single and rock on!"
4,"Great album soundtrack,but not 5 stars","The reason for my title is that some of the remakes absolutely suck. Marilyn Manson's cover of ""Highway To Hell"" is just noise. Drain sth's cover of ""20th Century Boy"" blows,and The Donnas' remake of KISS' ""Strutter"" is pitiful. The only half-decent covers are Pantera's take on Nugent's ""Cat Scratch Fever"" & Everclear's remake of ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". Some of the highlights on this cd are: ""Runnin' With The Devil"", ""Iron Man"", ""Surrender"", ""School Days"", and of course, KISS' songs. And KISS tries do copy Aerosmith & have Diane Warren write a ballad for them. Warren wrote Aerosmith's HUGE hit ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" for the Armaggdeon soundtrack. Well, ""Nothing Can Keep Me From You"" doesn't stack up. Don't get me wrong,it's a good song,but I've had my fill of Paul Stanley ballads. But then again KISS isn't Aerosmith. (I say this being a die-hard KISS fan for 21 years;so don't think I'm bad-mouthing KISS.They're just different bands)."
4,awesome cd..best songs by far were the orginal artists,I saw the movie heard the sound track...both were great..soundtrack would have been better if all songs were by the orginal artist...KISS FANS SHOULD ON THE WHOLE LIKE THIS SOUNDTRACK
2,Disappointing...,"Not as cute or informative as I had hoped. I was looking for an age appropriate Thanksgiving story for my 3-year old, but this is defintely more for toddlers than preschoolers. Not quite exciting enough to hold his interest."
3,Not easily adaptable to my shower head.,"Item as described but not easily adaptable to my shower head. The opening is not large enough for the showerhead arm, but too large for the hose. The spray will not stay in the direction I want it, or ""jump"" out of the bracket when the pressure is on or."
4,No hole hang up.,"The Waxman wall bracket is great. I was a little apprehensive at first, but after following the directions and attaching it to the tile, it works great. Very stable."
1,MONSTER,"THIS THING IS HUGE!!! I know the dimensions are listed but I must have underestimated it's size, because when I got it I didn't even take it out of the plastic box! You'd really have to rip something for this to work out!"
5,I liked it!,"I'm a long time fan of Lene Lovich, and I found this cd by chance when looking for another copy of 'No Man's Land'. I got this cd back in 2000 I believe. I read somewhere that Lene just hated the way they produced 'No Man's Land', and that that was her least favorite album because of it. If you've heard both versions of ""Special Star"", the original, and the one on 'No Man's Land', you'll see exactly what the fuss is. I must be weird though, because I love both versions!This cd has definitely been produced, similar to (though perhaps not quite so much as), 'No Man's Land'. So if that's an issue for you, you might not like it.The songs run the gamut of Lene's styles, from the silly, to the seriously political, love songs to a club danceable tune. The songs are not really dated, per se...but they do have that trademark LL '80s style. Four years after buying the cd, I still listen to it regularly.As a long time LL fan, I highly recommend it. It is not like 'Stateless', though."
4,"Nice, simple ring","I wanted a simple wedding ring, and this product fits the bill. I would have given it 5 stars, but the actual color is more like stainless steel and not the silver it appears to be in the picture. The ring is very smooth inside and out and is comfortable to wear. The outer surface is gently rounded, so it has more of a profile that a completely flat ring, but it's not obtrusive. Some scratches are already visible after 2 days of wear, but that's to be expected. At least I know it's not going to get bent out of shape!"
5,perfect case for my 10/22 in a archangel stock,this case came in perfect shape and fits my gun like a glove. i have maybe an inch or two to spare on either end so there's no unused or wasted space.
3,Good for what you pay,"This case is super-thin. The interior lining is not soft, but kind of tacky. At this price, it's not bad."
3,Average,I've got Allen bags for my 10/22s I was looking for a soft shell case for my AR... This bag does not seem to be made as well as other bags I own. The straps seem like they could snap fairly easily so only time will tell.
2,Buyer Beware,"Bought this for price and name. Know what you're getting. The two piece fence is difficult to true up. The sharp edges on the table ribs catch any imperfection in the workpiece and make it hard to move smoothly. The mechanism to lock the head in place raises the head 1/16"" and angles it closer to the fence by 1/32"". OK for real low precision work."
3,Delta Shaper,"As with everything, you get what you pay for. I own a Unisaw and Delta's 6"" jointer, both are industrial tools. When this shaper was delivered I noticied quickly that the collet was not in the center of the table openings. I called Delta and their suggestion was ""to file the insert plate to clear any bit that might com in contact with it"". This was not the answer I was looking for. There is obviously a different level of quality control put into their industrial tools that I have grown used to."
2,It's a PIG!,"If you want a router table and simply can't afford better then go for this thing. It has one speed, difficult to adjust fences and stock gets stuck on the ribbed table. Why do you think Norm Abrams replaced his with a home made version. If you do decide to buy, get rid of the two pieces of wood they call fences and replce them with one piece. The maybe, just maybe you'll be able to route something accurate."
