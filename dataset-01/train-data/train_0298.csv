2,Disappointing,"With so many excellent reviews, I thought this book would be a slam-dunk. Unfortunately, the story wasn't even compelling enough to finish.I agree with another Reviewer who was not able to get involved with the characters or care anough to see how the story ended (even trapped on an airplane for 3 hours). I felt no compassion for any character, and kept hoping some event would draw me in. So many deaths should have been interesting enough to keep me reading, but the author was so detached from the characters that I really couldn't find my way to caring.It was just too dull and cold of a book for my taste."
2,I didn't get it,"I did finish this book because someone recommended it. I never did get what was the author's purpose for this story. I found it full of superfluous ramblings that had nothing to do with the story and caused my mind to stray so that when it came back to some relevant point, my mind was no longer engaged. I found it so frustrating to keep having to go back to figure out what mattered and what didn't matter. The author is a good writer but not a great writer. A great writer can do these sidebar ramblings adding richness to the story. This did not happen for me. I finished it and thought ""what a waste of time"". That said, I would give her another try because so many people seem to like her writing."
2,Ho hum,"This book is basically 3 separate short stories, yet there are characters from each story that are related in the previous stories, but yet not always explained how they were related. I kept thinking it would all come together in the end; yet it never did. At times it was entertaining, but in the end, I didn't get the point of the stories. They just seemed to ramble on, with no clear storyline. If I had to summarize the book: it's about a gay man, who moves away from his family in Scotland to live in America. He has poor choices in friends, and many of them die of AIDS. Oh, and his deceased mother was good at breeding Collies."
3,WARNING,audible.com audiobooks may or may not work. may or may not take longer than reading the book. tech dept keeps banking hours and has one phone line.
2,"Well written, but rambling","I read this based on other people's recommendations and glowing reviews.The book is well crafted, and serves as a sort of travelogue. The descriptions of places are excellent. From the expanse of a Greek island to the aisles of a tiny bookstore, you can imagine how every thing looks, feels and smells.Somehow, this does not extend to the author's character development. If you are looking for a book where the characters have a moment of redemption, or epiphany, or even purpose then this is not the book for you.I found that disjointed story lines rambled to unsatisfying conclusions, and that characters who appeared in overlapping story lines were just coincidental.To say that the book reached a conclusion is a stretch. It would be more accurate to say that it rambled to an ending."
2,A Slow Read,"I am normally a fast reader. This book is well written, but the story line is slow and drages. It took me some time to get through this book. The book was a dissapointment, considering it won the National Book Award. Not something I would recommend."
2,Slow and boring,"This book was so slow! Normally I fly through books and this one took me over a month to finish becaust it was so boring! The first part was relatively decent, Paul's life was pretty interesting. After the first section though, it's not worth reading. Way too much on unlikable characters: Fenno, Mal, and Fern. I was hoping that the book would tell one of the other brother's stories after Fenno's, but for some reason it switched over to Fern."
2,Couldn't Finish...,"I would love to see what this author could do with a GOOD storyline. Her wonderful style of writing really caught my attention and I thought I was going to thoroughly enjoy the book; however, I just could not get into the confusing and drawn out plot."
2,over-hyped,"After reading all the glowing reviews on this book, I couldn't believe how bad it was. There are loose strings all over the place. The novel seems to be 3 short stories put together, but with no resolution on any of the significant issues that could tie everything together. The best characters are not well developed, although there are hints that these characters could have made up a compelling story. The main character, who is well drawn, is completely uninteresting with unclear motives.There is no denying that some of the writing is exceptional. But a novel commands that there be a plot and that it has characters that the reader will care about. Neither happened in my case. I only finished the book, because I kept hoping that something would happen and because I am reading the book for a book club. Fluff isn't enough.I would recommend this book to no one."
1,Terrible,"I read this book over vacation, which was a terrible choice I realize now. I should've known when I started it that it was going to be depressing. I have read my share of sad books and often enjoyed them when they offered insight into human nature or offered a message of sorts. This book has literally nothing to offer. It doesn't leave you feeling good or even remotely satisfied. I would summarize the book as others have done but a reader of this would be bored to tears by the summary. I hope that after reading this no one will choose to read or buy this book. The ending was the worst part. I actually threw the book across the room when I finished reading it because I was so absolutely dissatisfied. The most terrible thing was that the author set up a really good outline that could have had the most moving ending with so many twists that do not serve the point they could have. There was a chance for this book to be entertaining but it is not worth the time it takes to drudge through it."
4,takes awhile to warm up to,"this novel took me until about halfway through to decide I liked it. I read bits and pieces of it for over a month and then finished it in a few days. The family of this novel is reserved, and that comes through in the emotional impact of the book, at first. Then the reader comes to understand the characters, to feel what they feel, and in the end to love the family as their own."
4,Three Junes was great on Audio,"I have a long drive to and from work, and I must admit the story never really climaxed, but I was entertained and looked forward to hearing more about these characters and how they perceived the world. It may very well have been the character's insights into why they did and felt what they did, that made it compelling to listen to. I looked forward to getting back in my car and that alone made the 12 disc set worth the investment."
3,"Good Book Club Discussion, A Bit Too Wordy At Times","Ironically, before our book club had our official meeting for this read, everyone complained about it's complexity; however, after the meeting we all agreed that Three Junes provided us a bounty of discussion. Personally, I found it to be wordy at times rendering it difficult to digest. (An English Major in college yet I felt there were times when I had to ""plod"" through it.) The flashback sequences were distracting at times and many of the plot line issues seemed to be unresolved...e.g. Fern's purpose seemed unclear to us; we desired more information regarding Paul and Maureen's marriage or lack thereof, etc.I didn't really embrace any of the characters in this book. I found Fenno especially annoying and for the most part, aloof and too self-directed. However, his actions in Mal's death scene I found particularly poignant. It certainly is worth the read, but won't be for everyone."
2,"...to yawn, or throw the book down?","I do not understand why this book is winning such rave reviews. I struggled frantically against boredom, getting 2/3 of the way through, before I had to ""throw in the towel.""Neither the storyline, nor the characters captured my heart. I did not care about the characters. They felt flat, contrived, one dimensional.BANAL!If you are looking for a book about the relationships within a family try ""THE LOVELY BONES"" by Alice Seabold."
1,National Book Award???,"I thought this book was so thoroughly bad, I could not believe it won any award! It was boring, boring, boring. I did not enjoy the characters, from the mother who drowned puppies to the very unlikable and promiscuous bisexual character, Tony. It's pretentiousness and lack of passion truly made me want to throw it in the trash can. The only reason I finished it was because we had to read it for our reading group."
3,Not An Easy Read!!!,This book was hard to get into not an easy read!!! It was beautifully written though. Very descriptive of the characters and country. I found if I put the book down and wanted to get back into it it would be difficult.
2,not for me,"I love reading.. I love most books I read. Simply stated, this just did not do it for me. I could not get through it."
3,"Well written, but the characters were not fully developed","This book was very well written, but I felt the characters were not fully developed. Paul, Fern, Maureen, Fenno, Lucinda, David, Lil, Dennis, and Veronique were all interesting but were either not fully developed or were left hanging. Maybe the author wanted us to write our own stories about these characters."
2,Turgid and Disappointing,"As others have said, ""Collies"" - the first section - is wonderful. The characters are interesting and make you want to keep reading. ""Upright"" - the second section - dwells on Fenno - the gay character who has no idea how to live, love, or simply exist. He's completely uninteresting and reading the overly long section is painfully slow. ""Boys"" - the third section - concentrates on a completely different character who is only slightly more interesting than Fenno. The writing throughout is overly showy and detracts from the story. Read the first section and move on to your next book. The second and third sections are snooze city."
1,Don't waste your time - ignore this book,"National Book Award, what were you thinking? The writing is extremely tedious. The numerous parentheses and flashbacks in the book stop you from really getting into the story (which is okay, I guess, since the story is not that exciting). It's like if you were jogging (or biking) and someone constantly stopped you and then you were allowed to continue for 1 more block and then stopped again. I could excuse that kind of writing if there was good character development (this happens in some books. I once read a book where the writing was awful but the story was interesting) or a fun story. Save your money and more importantly your time and pick another book. I actually did not buy this book (my wife bought the book 3 years ago).If the choppiness of this review annoyed you, then Three Junes is especially not for you!"
2,Could Not Get Through It,Honestly this book was so slow moving I never ended up fisihing it. I read over half of it and could not bring my self to waste any more time. Just getting through what I did took me for ever because I had to make my self pick up the book and read it. I would not recommend this book. It is just to slow.
3,Could Not Get Into It,I has read the reviews before I bought this book and thought I would enjoy it. I really had a hard time getting through it. It was very slow moving. I wish I could get my money back.
1,Three Junes,"Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words. A discard. Not National Book Award Material."
1,Awful,This is an awful book. I got it as a present and force myself to finish it. Now I don't know what to do with it as I would not inflict it on anybody. Will probably recycle it.
1,who gives these awards???,"Award material? I don't think so. Maybe I should start writing books with controversial subject matter. Who but a gay man wants to read about a gay man's affairs and lusts? I wish the reviews and summary had told me what I was going to read before I -in haste- bought this book. I didn't even bother to finish the book, and I am left with a bad taste in my mouth for having tried. Not only does the book delve controversially, but it also proceeds at an exceedingly dull pace (in Book Two). The characters I like most are a tube of lipstick and a parrot...does that deserve accolades? Where are these book award judges living? Mars?"
1,I tried..........,"I started this book and read the first 50 pages and found it torture! I put it down, waited a week, and started it again. I ended up re-reading the beginning 3 times! I really hate to give up on a book - but this one just didn't grab me. Sorry....."
3,"Impressive, but.......","I had to make myself finish this book. Procrastinated for months. I wanted to fall in love with it, based on a couple of other people's enthusiastic raves, but I just couldn't mesh with the characters. Had a hard time caring about them. The writing is beautiful, true. The book as a whole feels like it's supposed to be an important book. But the motif with the letters frustrated me too much and I started to feel toyed with by the plot. It's impressive, all of it, but maybe wanting too hard to be impressive."
2,Wholly Unsatisfying,"Although beautifully written in certain places, the writing is more often pendantic, plodding, obtuse, and self indulgent. Rather than a novel, this book is more realistically a collection of three loosely related essays that would appeal only to the most patient of readers. Characters are introduced, the reader comes to care about them, only for the author to abandon them altogether. Major issues are introduced (i.e., the mother's possible relationships with another man, Paul's possible relationship with Marjorie in Greece, and the chance encounter between Fenno and Fern -- who had met Fenno's father a decade before), but are never explored, fully developed, discovered by those who should have discovered them, or resolved. There are so many loose ends, the book nearly unravels. The ending is equally dissatisfying, as the ""novel"" merely peters out. Perhaps the author simply ran out of ways to twist a sentence into near oblivion."
2,National Book Award???? Really???,"After starting this book once before and putting it down from boredom, I was determined to finish it the second time around. (Upon finishing the book I realized I should not have been so determined).The novel, broken up into three parts, lacks reader interest, good story flow and connectivity. The author tries to tell the story and history of the McLeod family but I found it way too complicated to comprehend the story the author was trying to convey."
2,Same thing again.,I love westerns and was expecting something special from someone whose name has (for me) always been associated with good writing of the era. Unfortunately it was a re-tread of previous tales.
5,great mystery and western,love Zane Grey. Zane Grey is a most noted American author of the last days of the wild West. He writes to all audiences
4,A true Zane Grey novel,"Was a true depectionof wat a person would have seen, heard, and done at this time of the settling of the western plains! GREAT READ!!!"
3,Sisters,"This is an entertaining 'beach read' about three sisters who are (surprise!) so different. There is the settled homemaker, Nessa, the busy career woman, Cate, and the flighty bohemian, Bree-- and the book follows their (mis)adventures in love and life. It is really similar to another book (Three Wishes by Liane Moriarty) so if you enjoyed this you will enjoy that one as well."
4,What a Crazy Guy,"I was expecting an adolescents type album, but i got a crazy punk fusion record. theres deffinitely some good songs here, as well as a hip hop song and a song that sounds like its in a bar with piano playing and Rikk ranting about something. took a few listens to get into, but its a really good album. worth getting."
4,Her best album,"Released in 1980, this is one of Joan's best. It's more upbeat and less serious (listen to Me Myself I) than her ealier work, yet contains some gorgeous ballads (All the Way from America). If you like Tracy Chapman or the Indigo Girls' early work, you'll love Joan."
4,COMIC TIMING.,"Where to begin! Lily Tomlin and Alan Ada at the top of their game in an all-round stellar comic starcast. Lighthearted but biting dialogue that houses a charming warmth for its dysfunctional characters.And a doozy theme: a new father's search for his birth parents. He can't name his own baby until he knows more about where he came from. The adoption agent who accompanies them is the epitome of the high strung New Yorker, whose goofs and gaffs lead the group into one riotous predicament after another. Particularly funny if you have recently been thinking of names for a baby, or if you can laugh at 60's counterculture.The movie is funniest in the last 15 minutes or so. The closing credits alone are worth the price of admission (or DVD). Recommended rental. Even better the second time round."
3,"Cute, but quite overrated","People kept urging me to see this ""great movie,"" which purports to be a kind of screwball comedy mixed in with a commentary on dysfunctional families and how they hold together despite their flaws. Well, it works on some levels; it is clever and original and often funny, but I wouldn't label it ""great.""Moreover, while I'm accustomed to suspending my disbelief, this movie asked me to suspend it too far. I'm not talking about the scattered plot or the kooky situations. I'm talking about the idea that a man married to the curvy, lovely Patricia Arquette would even look at someone as unattractive and scrawny as Tea Leoni."
2,"Outstanding cast, lousy script","I had never heard of this movie, but greatly admired the line-up.Unfortunately, the script is a series of left turns and sidetracks,and the thin storyline that is marginally focused is ludicrous to thepoint of being annoying. Amazingly, very few funny things happen in this movie, which is a shame. Ends abruptly and cluelessly as well."
4,Best armpit licking scene ever,"Ben Stiller is once again out to ""meet the parents"" - his own parents this time - but doing so proves, well, almost disasterous. The film presents an amusing cross-section of white America. Ben Stiller plays another uptight role (a blend of the Ben Stiller from Reality Bites/Meet the Parents/Royal Tenenbaums). I laughed out loud a few times and grinned quite a bit too. This movie is not for the typical movie watcher who still finds Hollywood formula comedies amusing. If you loved the Royal Tenenbaums you'd probably like or love this film. And any movie with an armpit licking scene is worth watching."
3,Terrible transfer to DVD,"This is a very funny movie and you should see it, but the transfer to DVD was just awful. I think it looked better on VHS tape (I'm not joking). The image is very, very grainy and poorly defined with pixelation becoming an issue especially in anything but bright light. Miramax really blundered with this release. Too bad, I was looking forward to it for a long time. And to top it off, there are absolutely no extras on the disc. Oh well. I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 because it really is a funny movie. Caveat emptor."
3,"Great cast, weak script.","Amazing cast of talented people who put in good performances despite the plodding script. Wow, if these top comic actors had better material this thing would have been dynamite. Instead, the few funny jokes you can all see coming a mile away.As an adoptee myself of the same age as Stiller's character, I can really relate to much of the truth in this movie. So I recommend this to grown adoptees as well as fans of the stars. Be sure to watch through the credits, some amusing scenes in there."
2,See annoying people argue with each other!,Nothing but neurotic people taking offense for no reason and arguing with other neurotic people. It's as though the scriptwriter/s assumed that putting irritating characters into preposterous situations would be enough to get a laugh. Don't believe what others said about it being like a Woody Allen movie - not even close.
2,I'd suggest that you rent the video or DVD,"Some laughs, and is worth seeing once, I'd say. I bought it because it was so highly recommended by a friend. I'm going to erase the tape, and use it to record something else."
2,Not one of Stiller's finest....,"I am a huge Ben Stller fan and was very excited to read the wonderful reviews on Amazon since I have never heard of this movie. I quickly ordered it and awaited the day when it would be delivered.After the first 30 minutes, I was bored. I turned it off and tried again to watch it a few days later. Loving Meet the Parents and Something about Mary, this movie was NOTHING in comparison to either of them. Very dark, dry humor about ben's character going cross country with his wife, child, social worker and two policeman who come along for the ride.I will admit that there were a couple of giggle moments (not laugh, giggle) but over-all, I was dissapointed with Flirting with Disaster."
2,"This just isn't a good movie, and I like movies","I like independant films, I like Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette, and while Tea Leoni isn't all that consistent an actress I've always had the hots for her, so I thought this was a sure bet. It just didn't come through. Stiller's character is actually quite annoying, Arquette's role is a thin caricature, and Tea Leoni's character, even when she's running around in her underwear, is just too strange to bear. I wish I had liked this film, but the whole thing just fell flat. Find a better move to buy."
3,cute,"this is a very cute costume and a good price, but it is very short and flimsy.. i wore it for halloween and i my self am i short person, i got a xsmall or a small and im 4'11 (14 years old) and my bf said when ever the wind blew my butt would show.. and the wind blew ALOT that night (which might not have been a big problem for him)..also the button part keep dropping down (thank god there was a whit shirt attached) but i needed safety pins also. but overall this is a nice outfit ...you just might want to wear a pear of boyshorts underneath"
5,Fabulous book for the more creative quilter,I had seen this book at a friends house and really wanted one of my own. Amazon was the only place I could find it. It is a wonderful book for creative ideas! I recomend it highly for the artist and creative quilter.
3,Buy It For The One Song,Not the best Gun Club album by a long way but one or two tracks stand out. The Idiot Waltz is one of the most beautiful Gun Club songs of all time and made the purchase well worthwhile for me.
4,You feel included,"22 Dec 11I enjoyed Buckley through the years. As a result of his conversations w/Muggeridge, I have read several of Malcolm's books.This DVD's material [[ASIN:JrB001E52UBC Firing Line with William F. Buckley . ""Do We Need Religion or Religious Institutions?""]] is informative and relaxing. Muggeridge is forthcoming--doesn't dodge questions. He had not converted to Catholicism at this juncture; however, he and his wife did convert a few years before he died. I bet he was welcomed to heaven."
5,Muggeridge is brain food.,"IBuckley's discussions with Muggeridge are brain food. Muggeridge knows whereof he speaks. He lived among kings, but for the final 25 years of his life..lived simply in rural England doing simple chores; such as feeding his chickens daily."
5,Love this album,"i love most the songs on thismy favorite is""time will tell'but i also lovefirst loveautomaticb&c;in my roompaint it blackanother chanceyeah pretty much the whole albumthis album is great,i dont know if i would buy the cd anytime soon becuase i already have all the songs on my ipod and computerbut i would eventually buy it for my collection"
1,Do you like this album? I don't think so.,"I'm listening her album,but I regret that I bought her album for almost $ 40 .What's so special about this album? There's nothing special in this album. There are many singers who can sing a song like that way in USA,Japan and even Korea."
3,The Formula to J-Pop?...It's Automatic,"After living in Japan for almost four years, I'd given up entirely on the J-Pop scene. It's basically New Kids on The Block, but much, much worse. Then along comes Utada Hikaru, who went to school in New York City and is the daughter of a famous Japanese ""enka"" singer. Her CD, First Love, clearly has a strong western influence, particularly in the production. I have to give this 16-year-old a lot of credit for writing her own tunes. She also blends Japanese and English lyrics very smoothly in tunes like the title track. (Most Japanese artists fail miserably in this endeavor.) I enjoyed this CD a lot but fear Hikaru is already falling prey to the big money marketing sharks in Japan. I cringe now when I see her doing ads for Sony while lip-syncing to her latest single. Maybe a real artist emerging from the J-Pop scene was too much to be true."
5,first love,i like this songs n' I hope some one can sent me this song to my email address in ari15411@lovemail.com
5,Hikari's the best!!!,"The song ""First Love"" is the best love song I've ever heard!!! I'm looking for the cd and this has got to be worth it! I don't even know Japanese but her voice is so soothing. ""First Love"" made me remember my first crush and it made me so emotional! Although I haven't heard the other songs yet, i'm sure we can trust Hikari's singing. If I don't get this cd, i will drop dead."
5,Incredible Music,"Utada Hikaru, famous in Japan, has definitely brought something that I would say is new to any American listening to the music. Perhaps, yes, it is influenced by some other forms of music and artists in those genres, but there's nothing else like the vibrance, the life, and the simple beauty of Japanese Pop music. In any language, this music is great. This CD is a must buy!"
5,"UTADA HIKARU'S SONG ""FIRST LOVE"" ROCKS!!",UTADA HIKARA IS AN AWESOME SINGER. I LOVE HER SONG FIRST LOVE!! AND I DEFINITLY THINK SHE HAS ENOUGH FANS IN CALAFORNIA THAT SHE SHOULD TOUR OVER HERE!!
2,2 and a Half,I saw this movie a long time ago on HBO and remembered it as being a good movie and very interesting. I took it out the other day and put it in and watched it again. I must say that it seems dated now. I would like to see them remake Barry Seals story now. Hopper is ok but he pretty much is 'Dennis Hopper' with a fake accent. The movie is still good and informative but it just seems like and early 80's movie. The characters are kind of cartoonish and the acting is kind of second rate and that takes away from the realism.
4,"If you like a good real life story, you will enjoy this film","It starred the great actor Dennis Hopper as Berry Seal, a DEA informant. He was hoping to get no time in jail if he helped the government in their pathetic ""war on drugs"" (liberals and conservatives can agree it's been a complete failure). Hopper's portrayal of Seal gives me the impression that the informant was a brash adventurer who smuggled drugs just as much for the thrill as for the money. When caught, he didn't turn on his partners in crime but did help get evidence about the drug smugglers in South America. He did risk his life and he should have got what the government promised. What he got was doubled-crossed.Seal was far from an upstanding citizen but his treatment by our government is reprehensible."
1,"A History Channel ""BUST""","this game is not realistic and not fun to play...usually you can expect high quality and good value for anything with ""The History Channel"" name on it....however....in this case it is a real ""DUD"".don't waste your money!!!"
2,If you like kids shoot'em up games this is for you,This is an arcade type real time first person kind of game. How much real history is there depends on your viewpoint on shoot'em up games. I did not care for it at all and was a waste of my time. If you want real history look for the HPS games.
1,Civil War A Nation Divided,My daughter bought this program for me for Christmas because I am a Civil War enthusiast. What a piece of junk!!! I realized it would not run on Vista so I attempted to run it in XP compatible ... no luck. I tried three different video cards ... still no luck. I then brought out my work laptop with XP and it fits all of the requirements. It will go past the first minute and then the frame rate is so bad it is not worth playing. If I had known that it was a worthless game I would have returned it but since I have used Activision before I felt I would eventually get it to operate correctly ... wrong.Don't waste your money!
3,Winning the Oil Endgame,A rather technical report consisting of suggestions for government agencies to enact to aid in the transistion from oil to alternative energy sources. There's not a lot of practical material in the book for things the average citizen can do to survive the transition.
5,Awesome,"This product is the only reason why my husband is allowed to sleep in my bed:) Without it, his snoring keeps me awake so I had to kick him out. I would recommend to anyone."
1,Too small,I bought this for my 6 year old & it's way too small for her. Probably better for the 2/3 year old set.
2,serious issues with audio track,"The documentary itself is as appealing and entertaining as it was when I first saw it in 1984, but this DVD has a really distractingly awful sound issue. I read somewhere that it was recently remastered, and apparently it was a bad idea, because in many sections, there was a kind of white noise sound that made it incredibly difficult to hear the film. I am not one for writing negative reviews, but when the sound makes a rockumentary almost unwatchable, that's a major problem."
5,AMAZING......,Words can't describe how incredibly happy I am that SING BLUE SILVER is on DVD!! Seeing Simon in his mid 20's is amazing! Perfomers from today should watch and learn from SING BLUE SILVER on how a real documentary should be done. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. WELCOME BACK DURAN DURAN.
4,Not all it could have been!,"I'm a huge Duran Duran fan and feel guilty at not giving the Sing Blue Silver DVD a 5-star rating, but have to say I was dissapointed when I sat down to watch it last night. First off, the Duran Duran video DVD release was so packed with extras and Easter eggs that I couldn't wait to see what SBS had to offer - and found nothing. How can they release this seminal program with no extras?? The most glaring omission is 5.1 surround sound. The program itself is still amazing and made me hugely nostalgic for 1984, but EMI missed a huge opportunity to make this great program an outstanding release. I'd rather have extra footage than see the DVD packaged in a fuzzy box that's going to wind up scratched anyway."
5,Brings back great memories,"This DVD is a great ad to your Duran Duran collection. It's a documentary of their huge 1983-84 Seven And The Ragged Tiger Tour. I can only remember this being shown a couple of times on MTV, and even then, I don't think they showed the entire show that's on this DVD. If you're a fan of DD, don't hesitate to get this DVD now."
3,Duran Duran Sing Blue Silver,"Well, I thought it was going to have extra items, documentaries, etc. NO... it does not. No difference being re-released, although the sound is clearer and picture. Not enough to make me buy it again or recommend it to anyone. Only a collectors item if you want to add to your collection. After what Andy said in his book ""THE WILD BOY"" kind of wish they would of put allot of that footage, then I would really recommend it! :)"
3,Great camera for PC- Firewire not for MAC's!,"I purchased the JVC 31 model and was immediately impressed by the generous lcd screen size. Also, the 400X was helpful on my trip x-country from Tampa to Seattle. Lots of good effects-bells whistles with cd quality sound to boot. I'd give it 5 stars, but had to return it because of lack of compatibility with my new DV-MAC...even with the firewire port. Major :( PC's go for it MAC's beware!"
1,No wonder kids hate math,"When taught from books like these. This type of instruction presumes that kids learn only in the class room. If you are an engaged parent wishing to help coach your child at home, this book is maddeningly frustrating because all the context is with the class room teacher and you are given a book that is lacking context and is full of meaningless tripe. If your child had any interest in math, this book would make sure they'd start hating it. That's the compromise I suppose for sparking a tiny amount of interest in math in kids who hated math to begin with.America should give this type of instruction the boot if we ever hope to get our children interested in math and engineering."
1,Not good,"I have a CA high school math teaching credential. I've been teaching 20 years, and I believe I'd put this book at or near the bottom of all the high school math texts I've ever seen.I've gone through the IMP year 4 book. There are virtually no equations given. No sample problems solved. The series relies totally on the teacher to give this information in the classroom, or for the students to ""discover it"" which makes no sense. A text book is meant to be used as a resource in conjunction with classroom lessons. This book is just a long, ongoing word problem with no practice problems or any other such support for the topic.Yes, this book is way outside the box. If you want to do well on the SATs and/or ACTs, or expect your students to do anything in college that is science or math oriented (Biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry) do not use this book. It could be used as a supplement to a regular math text book, but that's a lot of $$ for some word problems.Not good."
4,Well made warm liners,These are well made and work well as liners for ski or hiking socks. Not as good a silk but less pricey. Fussy on care though
5,WIGWAM THERMAX LINERS,THE WIGWAM LINERS FOR YOUR FEET IN COLD WEATHER ARE PERFECT. JUST A REGULAR PAIR OF SOCKS AND THESE LINERS WILL KEEP FEET WARM AT THOSE COLD TEMPERATURES AND SUB ZERO TEMPS. I WEAR THEM WITH MY GOLF SHOES IN LATE FALL (NOVEMBER) TO PLAY GOLF AT 30 DEGREES. NEVER HAVE COLD FEET. IN THE WINTER I WEAR THEM WITH MY SORRELL BOOTS AT TEMPS IN THE MINUS ZERO ZONE LIKE 25 BELOW AND I CAN WALK OUTDOORS FOR HOURS. THEY FIT GOOD EVEN AFTER SEVERAL WASHINGS. IN FACT I WILL GET 2 TO 3 YEARS WEAR OUT OF A PAIR.
3,Doesn't have OE Connector,"Even though this product is listed to work with specific cars, it's actually a universal sensor. It doesn't have an electrical plug to connect it to my (supposedly compatible) 91 Range Rover. The plug end of the sensor is just 3 wires that you must splice to a connector you already have (like on the oxygen sensor you're removing)."
4,A ROCKING THRILL..,"Lee Aaron `s second album,Metal queen,is an albumfilled with great old rock songs,wich she carries out with an enormous vocal capasity.For those out there who love classic hard rock,this is stronglyrecomended."
3,"Beautiful Voice, Lame Lyrics","I'm giving this CD 3 stars only because of Lee's very awesome voice. It's actually really sad to here a beautiful voice that can rock with such horrid, lame lyrics. There's not one song on this CD that I can relate to . . what a waste of money. If you really want to listen to a woman who rocks and has outstanding lyrics, check out anything by Doro Pesch, esp. the CD ""Doro"" and her most recent ""Fight."""
2,Okay but not great,"The authors seem torn bewtween writing a C++ tutorial and a data structures tutorial. As a result neither topic is presented as well as it could or should be presented. Their approach also seems fragmented sometimes as though they start to explain something, think better of it, and jump to another topic. I am glad I am already experienced in these data structures and C++ since I would dread trying to learn either from this book."
2,"More ""Workbook"" than ""Textbook""","It's a thick book, with lots of figures, and with very readable prose. If you intend to read it cover to cover, working the examples as you go, you'll get a decent introduction to both C++ and to data structures. Unfortuntantly, you won't get a really good introduction to either.As a reference text when working on assignments or projects unconnected to the book it feels especially poor. It's easily readable prose comes at the expense of brevity, and dipping into it to refresh an idea or approach means wading into a peat bog of example code and implementation specific advice.I've read only one other C++ data structures book, but I'd certainly recommend it (""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" by Adam Drozdek) over this one."
4,Good introduction to data structures,"I don't agree with the negative comments made about the book.It is not a text that introduces concepts of programming languages, or how to program in C++.I find the text easy to read, and the introduction to data structures easy to understand.As far as code examples and associated compile errors are concerned, the reader/students should implement their own code and use the text only as a guideline. How else do you learn?An improvement to the text (5 stars instead of 4 stars) would be including a chapter on shared memory. The author discusses dynamic allocated memory, but does not address shared memory. Most text books avoid the topic, but it should be covered for completeness."
3,Not the best.....,"This is a book I purchase for a college class. If you have a very firm grasp on c++ and are looking to learn data structures you may have better luck with this book than I have. The book is very repetitive on parts that most programmers at the level where they should be learning c++ data structures should already be very familiar with, but when it comes to the new material they are a bit vague. I do like that the example programs from the book are all online and can be accessed easily, however I have found that I have better luck learning the data structures by reading my first c++ book which was on learning c++ from ""Hello World"" to Binary Trees. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Readable but horrible,"Our teacher assigned this text because we all had such a good experience with Savitch's ""Problem Solving with C++"". This book is however quite horrible. The text goes on and on and on and on! If you only needed a page or two of concise reading to get an idea, this book will make sure that you read through eight pages of unnecessary garbage to get there. Our teacher would assign the chapters as reading, and I would try staying up to 3AM the night before trying to read the very long chapters, and it is ridiculous!Our teacher even turned on it later. The book breaks rules for good coding in its examples that our teacher had to explicitly point out (and she did take off for those errors in our own programs). I think there is only supposed to be ""one entry, one exit"" and no breaking out of a program, and the book has other errors too."
4,A more accurate review - First Semester Algorithms,Most poor ratings of this product are due to the readers' lack of intelligence. It's a begining book on algorithms. The last chapter on Graphs was weak but all in all its a good start. A definite recomend for self learning.
1,Student,"This is not a good book. If you need to use this book for a class, be sure to supplement it with something else. Its coverage of inheritance and polymorphism is not very good. Refer to Deitel & Deitel C++ How to Program 2nd Ed. chapters 9 and 10. It will save you a headache. Also, look over the data structures chapter in Deitel & Deitel for code snippets for projects. For a few laughs, you might want to try downloading some of the authors source code and watching it throw compile errors with VC++.If you don't need this book for a class, try not to buy it unless you are held at gunpoint and forced to."
3,Historical footnote,"As commented by other reviews this book is rather dated in its wildness athough at the time of its initial release was a a mild shocker. The Boyfriend was in fact Spike Hawkins. ""Who had a wife and three children in Edgware"". His middle son ended up in the Rock Group 'Big Audio Dynamite' with Mick Jones from The Clash."
5,Perfect,"This was exactly what i needed, these are a 1/3 of the price that i could find local plus everyone else had to order as well so didn't lose anytime and saved a bunch of money."
4,Great little indie CD,This is a great little indie rock CD. I especially like the track FIRECRACKER.
2,"Simple, basic, standard health info","If you're well read in the field of health and nutrition, don't expect to learn anything new from this book. It's the most basic type of health guide, like your insurance company hands out."
5,The best knife ever,"The knife handle fits nicely and securely in my hand with the special finish. The seven inch blade is great for cutting fruits, vegies, and meats. The blade remains sharp with daily use.I own six other sizes of Sanelli knives - they are the best I have ever used."
4,Gift's For Music....,"Just like the title of the album my mind was free for the duration of the CD... I got this album thru a friend that did not like this album and gave to me as gift... Mike's an excellent musician and his album is a joy to listen to. Get this one, kick back and enjoy..Sad part is that he only recorded this once off album...Mokgabudi J"
2,"Hi price, other options",Wally world has similar size & weight in the flower arrangement dept. They are clear glass & 3 lbs. bag is $4.00.
2,"This is a good reference book, but not a review book.","I read the whole book. I recently took the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam, and found that the book wasn't crucial in passing the exam. I had already taken pharmacy tech classes at a college, which helped me a lot more. I recomend buying another books that discusses specific pharmacy tech topics, unlike this one which goes through the pharmacy situations very superficially. It also has a lot of pages of practice problems, practice physician orders, and empty charts to fill in which took up a large portion of the book. In fact, out of the 400 pages in the book, about 2/3 were blank tables to fill in, practice physician orders, practice prescriptions, and references of drugs. A better use of money for preparing for this test is another book that doesn't act as a list of drugs and their uses. A book with detailed pharmacy operations, and calculations is essential for doing well on the exam."
4,Funny stuff all the time,Always funny every time you see it. Its nice because it has a lot on it so you can't stop watching it until its over.
4,Good double stroller,"I bought this Baby Planet Unity Sport for my twins that are 5 months old. I have a BOB Duallie Revolution and LOVE it! But, it is too big for malls, etc.. so I needed an umbrella type stroller. We chose this one after much researching due to the small wheel in the middle back to make it easier to walk and the handle, and we liked the way it looked -- it looked a bit more ""sturdy"" than the Maclaren. I am happy with it over all, my babies love to be in it and seem very comfy. It is not as easy to steer as my BOB jogger, but is ok - it is a bit large for going in between racks, the wheels would get caught in small stores --- BUT, when you have twins, you don't have a choice--it is way easier to maneuver than a front/back stroller. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase - love the ease of folding and unfolding."
3,Good Stroller but hard to Turn,"I have had this stroller for about 2 weeks now. My girls love it. (They are 3 and 1). I think it is a good stroller but not great. It is easy to push once going and folds relatively easy. What I don't like is the turning ability of this stroller. It is very difficult to turn especially when going slowly or going in/out doorways. It is OK when you have a bit of momentum. It really isn't a 'one hand push' stroller - if you are going straight on an even surface not too bad, but anything else and I find you have very little control.I would also hate to push the stroller when loaded to full capacity. I am lucky that my girls are small - they total less than 50lbs.I do love that it fits through all standard doors (even in Manhattan) and in my small elevator. I like the storage space even though it has the weird cross bars in the baskets. I like the position of the cupholders on the handle. The height of the handle is great even for my 6ft husband."
4,"Better than our tandem, folds up to fit in a compact car.","As mentioned before, the seat belt cover falls off easily and it's difficult to open up until you use it a while. The fact that it's mostly recyclable is a real plus in our throwaway society. The pros outweigh the cons, the wheels are durable, unlike our old stroller. Don't have enough time to write a full review, let's just say I'd buy it again."
3,It's a great stroller so long as you don't ever need to transport it.,"Once open, it works great. That being said, opening and closing is a joke. I've never encountered a more difficult stroller."
1,Awful! Don't waste your money!,"For the price, this stroller is definitely not worth the money. The sun hoods do not pivot, so when you face the sun, your children are in direct sunlight, and there is nothing to do to fix this. The stroller is also incredibly heavy and is very awkward to pick up. I am not a happy customer and am in the process of returning it."
3,Really hard to open,"I was so excited when we ordered this stroller for our 6 month & 2 1/2 yr old boys) Loved the design and color.. We read the reviews and had decided there was more positive reviews and made our purchase. We had high hopes.. but sadly this stroller is not what we had hoped for.. Out of the box.. after my husband built it, we noticed that the logo on the seat was stiched upside down.. (NOT WORTH RE-PACKAGING AND SHIPPING BACK) It is really hard to open & close (Has not loosened up much with time) It is also heavier then the other double strollers we looked at. I find myself avoiding errands and/or stops, unless my husband is with me to deal with the stroller. Defeats the reason for having a double stroller.. We removed the center strap covers the first day.. The canopies do pop off with almost every use. Once you get it opened and all the peices reattached it moves fine.. But not worth the price paid.."
5,Very Pleased with this stroller,"I just received this stroller in the mail and am very happy with it. I am expecting my second son any day, and have an 18 month old son. I've already taken him for a couple walks in it, so he gets used to it and he really likes it. It's so easy to steer and turn, much easier than any other strollers that I tried out in Babies R Us. It is a little hard to fold up, but I've read other reviews that say after a few times of folding it, it gets ""worn in"" I highly recommend this stroller."
4,A Real Cooker,"This is a great album from Dexter Gordon's Denmark period, swinging and driving as always. ""Antabus"" is a real cooker where everyone really tears it up. I think this time period brought out some of Dexter's best, and not long after this he was ""rediscovered"" upon returning to the U.S. (see his ""Homecoming"" cd, also terrific).If you want to hear Dexter Gordon swinging in his prime, check this out."
1,This IS NOT the one I was looking for,"The Cold Chillin compliation I was looking for was waaay better that this collection. It came as a double CD, it had these hits and many more, some of them were from artists post Juice Crew era. I'm trying to find Duck Alert by Craig G, and it was on the The Best of Cold Chillin Records. It was blue and had a picture of all the Juice Crew on it except for MC Shan, Im so sad that I wont be able to find this gem :("
1,Disappointed,I have been playing this game for years and I seen all kinds and was quite disappointed with the quality of this product. The instructions looks as if it was copied from the internet and I will think twice before purchasing another game like this.
4,Re=read,"I had read the book, as well as almost all the Destroyer series and have almost all the books from the start to the 100's. Remembered how entertaining they were 40-50 years ago so decided to begin anew. Still entertaining and an easier read than Robin Cook."
3,Different than the movie,"I wish that I had read a few before buying so many of them. It's much different than the original movie. Still, it has potential to be good. Friends liked it years ago"
3,Hey? Where's my earlier review?,"What happened to all the earlier reviews of this book? There were a few. I know I wrote one; this is one of the books that had just atrocious scan errors. Whole paragraphs missing. Perhaps it has been rescanned and put back up on the site? If so, how come those of us who bought it earlier are not getting the better, corrected version?"
5,the life of Shakespeare as researched by S.Schoenbaum,This book is the most thorough book on the life of the Bard
2,Not train track!,"I didn't realize there were different kinds of Thomas track. The Thomas track that has been in our train sets so far flips--one side train, the other side road. That is why I didn't read all the details of this ROAD track and ordered 2 sets! The trains don't stay on it since it is too wide and they are curves. The quality of the track is nice, what I expect with Thomas (no rough edges, splinters, irregular edges like with Brio). But I don't want/need road track, I want train track!"
4,birdie,"Great recording, great musicians. Andrea Marcelli is a hidden gem, as good as his 91 release ""Silent Will"". All songs arranged by Marcelli - he has a great talent of writing good compositions for the style of musician. Allan Holdsworth's guitar playing is particularly strong - as always - and its great to hear the fretless bass playing of Gary Willis. Blend of upbeat fusion and moody songs - would recommend!"
5,"""South Side"" brings home the best in Chicago jazz","Without a doubt, Peter Lerner is one of the best guitarists in the world. ""South Side"" clearly displays his great versatility and personal style that has matured over the past twenty years working with jazz greats like Ramsey Lewis.Any audiophile will enjoy and appreciate the upbeat and vivacious sound of this great CD-from Lerner's lively version of Kenny Burrell's ""Chitlin's Con Carne"" to the revelation of his masterful techniques in the intricacies of the beautiful and powerful ""Lotus Flower.""You definitely owe to yourself to treat your ears and soul to the musical gifts of ""South Side""!"
4,Country for those who don't really like country,"For people who are really picky about what country they listen to, I highly recommend this album. It seem to have a lot more soul in it than most of today's mainstream ""country music"". Great Album."
5,You cant have the very best of Yoakam,"This cd was my first introduction to Dwight. It made me buy every one of his studio albums. He is an amazing artist and has one of the greatest voices in the history of country music. I highly recommend his cds Long Way Home, Gone, and his acoustic cd. Excellent album, excellent artist."
5,Always the Best from Dwight !!,I have loved Dwight's Music for years and this is definitely the Very Best. Have shared this CD with friends and even those who are not big fans of Country loved it.
5,Not bad...,"This is full of MOST of his greatest hits and some good ones I have never heard before... I listen to it constantly, and now my kids love it as well. The only criticism is that there are a few songs missing... Pocket of a Clown, Claudette, Always Late with your kisses.... where are these songs???? I thought this was a greatest hits CD?"
2,Not the quality,"Not the quality I expected of Dwight...used to enjoy his songs, some having been favorites of mine. Disappointed, but, oh well."
4,"Missing a few hits, but overall great collection","probably the best collection out for this artist, although the cover art shown is NOT the album i purchased"
5,Some Really Good Music,"I listen to a lot of country music, but I always go back to Dwight's music. There's just something about it that's addictive. This CD has some of his best."
5,if you are old skool it is a must,"let me tell you this is the ultimate compulation you got the god of hip hop rakim allah and the best cut of hip hop history""the symphony""and a host of all types of hip hop classics.it is well worth what ever they are asking for it."
5,"Adorable, warm, amusing look at moms","At last, a book about mothers that sees both the lighter side and the fuzzy warm side. So accessible because it's the observations of children in their own words and in their own handwriting. The charm is increased by the colorful, witty illustrations created by the compiler. This is the perfect package of mother's role seen by their offspring. A marvelous gift to give not only on Mother's Day but any day of the year to a mother or even a dad. This book has all the charm of the author's ""Children's Letters To God"", ""Me and My Dad"" and ""Grandma, Grandpa & Me."" A total delight."
4,Radiohead is Readiohead,"Para quem gosta, é um prato cheio de umas das bandas mais famosas do indie Rock.Melhores sucessos e excelente performance."
1,"Not as ""nature"" intended-","As mentioned previously, Radiohead is not a best-of band. The albums should be heard in their entirety, as even the ones you may not enjoy after the first couple listens will seem to grow on you and maybe even haunt you. This is an unauthorized compilation (well not band approved at least) with $$$ being the only objective by a disgruntled label."
4,"Yes, but","My only hesitation in buying the DVD and ""Hits"" CD is that they were put out by the old label and the band doesn't approve of supporting them.So I feel guilty, but I wanted these items for a shared collection with a Radiohead Superfan. She's happy. I'm happy. At least I made up for it by buying the $80 In Rainbows package AND paying for the downloadable CD."
2,....no Idioteque?,"I didn't even know this release was coming out until a week before the street date. Initially the excitement built up because I figured one of my favorite Radiohead songs, ""Idioteque"" would be on this DVD, for SURE.Imagine my amazement when I checked the track listing and failed to find it on here. As others have mentioned the quality is lacking and nothing has been done to remaster the older material for the digital age. Sloppy work by the label and I guess I'll continue to wait for ""Idioteque""..."
1,Sad but true,"When I saw that radiohead was releasing a ""best of"" album and DVD, I was shocked. Not that they don't have an incredible library of music and video to share because they do. It's just hard to believe because they have always been a band that innovates rather than duplicate. After giving fans a beautiful album, 'In Rainbows', and releasing it in a creative yet lucrative manner, I figured they were above the old money-maker greatest hits nonsense. I haven't looked into it much and maybe this is just something that their old label, Parlaphone, came up with to get back at them for their self-released album but I never expected to see the day."
3,Product Isn't What I really Wanted,I thought I was getting a real Sony battery but it isn't. It's about three tiems the size but works OK.
1,Terrible,Yhis show is terrible. The characters are boring and the story drags. This is just hard to get through.
5,Great service,"Item was as described or better, arrived very quickly, professionally packed. Recommended. Nice BBC suspense, mystery."
2,Predictable plot by acting zombies,"Boy, was this predictable! Edward Woodward, having a minor part, was the only person who was phased at all in the movie about the kidnapping of his great grandchildren and the death of his grandaughter. Boring, monotone British movie."
2,Characters are unsympathetic,"It was difficult to care about these characters -- even in ""life or death"" situations they just didn't elicit my sympathy. I would not recommend this."
2,"Great start, very slow ending","I love BBC shows. I love how the Brits use normal looking actors and actresses not ""hollywood pretties"" and this mini series starts out great. The first 3 episodes move right along and keep you guessing. The last two, however, move through molasses and you can guess the ending. You don't really care at that point either, you just wish you had some of your time back."
3,Great while it worked.,"We had this printer for MAYBE two years when it just ""stopped"" working. It was a great printer while it lived. It did seem to got through a lot of ink, more than any other printer we've had. Anyway, as much as I loved the printer... there is no way I'd pay $325 for it (price when I posted this-4/12/08). I bought it for $209 in 2005. I don't think I'd spend $150 on it today. You could buy better pinters now for less."
1,good printer...but rebate declined?,I bought this with the Powershot A510 to get the $70 rebate for the 2 items together. I never got the rebate and after contacting Canon for a month they tell me they never got the box tabs. Of course I sent them with the rebate form. So now I have no boxes and no rebate. Very aggravating and disappointing!
1,Messermeister Butane Torch,"I have Purchased two of these torches and love the look and feel. The problem I've had with both of them is the safety button at the back of the torch which you have to depress before you can light it is very hard to engage, and has broken on both units. Also when the torch lights, it will not go out until the unit runs out of fuel....VERY Dangerous!!I called the manufacturer and they were very helpful and quick to respond by replacing the units. It has been over a year, and the one has failed again and will not shut off after replacing the button. The other one is still going strong.I love the torch, but would like to see the child safety switch removed.... I am retired and don't have any children. The safety switch is small and hard to engage."
3,Interesting lyrics and solid sound... Holocaust pulls it off,"One thing heavy metal is generally noted for is it's tendency to adhere to some trully fantastic lyrics. Well, Holocaust doesn't try and break the cliche but they certainly do a good job of playing it out. The lyrics are largely inspired by ""The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever"" and have an incredible fantasy sound to them. However, the lyrics are all very well written, as is the music. This alblum is worth buying merely for the incredible metal epic ""The Battle of Soaring Woodhelven"", which peaks at over 16 minutes and tells a trully interesting story. The only real weakness in this alblum is the tendency for long instrumental segments that aren't particularly uplifting or inovative. It tends to drag one down and make one reach for the button to forward to the next track. Don't though... sit through this and you'll learn to love it."
3,spacey metal,"Very spacey metal (high tone keyboards) and very cool, however it's only 40 minutes of music. But really worth listening several times :-))"
2,"This book has good intentions, but...","I have been a Solaris system admin for some time, so I understand a bit about this subject. However, when going through this book word by word, I have found mistakes that make it almost impossible for the average user to learn. Fortunately for me, I can look and say, hey, this isn't right and figure out what figure he should be referencing; figure out that his IP address was added incorrectly, figure out what the heck he is REALLY talking about. Whoever proofread this book should be fired! IE. page 375, Table 13.3 stop (table says this command STARTS a service)! Too many mistakes to mention individually. Some of it is well written, but certainly not much of it for my mind."
5,The Best of Its Class,"Michael Jang's Mastering Red Hat Linux 9 is bar-none, simply the best of the BIG books on RH 9. Beginners through advanced users alike will find it invaluable as a reference.It's obvious this book was written from scratch -- so many books suffer from over revision with errors and sentences stuck in here and there that don't make sense, but not this book.Jang is an excellent author -- thank you, Michael, for putting so much effort into your writing. It's clear you have the reader's needs in mind and that you understand the challenges Linux users face, and the questions we will inevitably come up with. In the perfect world, Red Hat would give authors like Michael some of the profits, since his book will most definitely help their company sell more product."
2,Takes too much for granted...,"I had great expectations when I first opened the book, expecting a tutorial format leading me from novice to accomplished. I'm pretty disappointed... On the surface, the book appears to head in that direction, but I soon found myself being ""exampled"" to death with commands that had not been previously introduced or explained. I got the distinct impression that Mr. Jang was trying to show us readers just how knowledgeable he is on the subject. I'll grant him that, but that's not what I needed.The book has lists of ""things"" in many places, but I'd much rather have an explanation of the relevant items before I'm tossed the entire set of ""things"" with no way to discern what's most important from what's less so. I've learned more from the online RedHat documentation than I've learned from this book; if I had the chance to learn Linux all over again, I'd spend my money elsewhere. Caveat emptor, as always...."
2,disappointing for previous Irene Adler fans,"I was very disappointed with this novel, as I have really enjoyed all the previous Irene Adler books by CND (though I don't read the cat books.) It was much more grisly than the previous books. It took a long time to plow through, and the switches to journals other than Nell's in some chapters were often confusing. I finally finished it last night, only to find that it didn't really end-you have to wait until the next book to find the resolution. I was annoyed. I wish I had read some of the other warnings from reviewers."
2,Huge disappointment,"I loved the previous Irene Adler books and bought them as gifts for people, so I was seriously disappointed when I read this one. I would never buy it for anyone. I am dismayed by an author and a publisher who would sell a book that is incomplete and ends with a cliffhanger. Who needs the aggravation? Furthermore, there is no pleasure in reading the book - it is tough slogging the whole way. If I wanted to put that much effort into my leisure reading, I'd get a physics textbook or something equally interesting. At least I'd be learning something."
2,Tedious and disappointing,"For inveterate readers of Holmesian pastiches, this will rank fairly low on the list, and it's certainly a disappointment after the previous installments in Douglas's otherwise fine Irene Adler series. The main plot element - Holmes meets Jack the Ripper - is a tired and overdone cliche. The book moves along too slowly and is overburdened with endless descriptions of clothing and other distractions. The plot devices seem overly contrived, and settings like the wax museum and the exposition seem gratuitous. And the ""you will buy the sequel"" cliffhanger ending feels like a ripoff."
2,"Oh please, at least make it understandable!!!","Ok, so maybe i haven't read the other novels of the Irene Adler saga, i didn't have to, this was after all, a report. A great topic and era to present this story in, and the cast of characters were unbelievably cool and rich in historical fact, but the ending was a total cliff hanger, which turns away readers like me, who are probably not going to buy the sequel, and the narritive moving from Nell to Pink is alright but the other little tid bits were weird and really confusing, not really necessary in story. I still would recomend the book if you are into these types of stories, although i don't know who would want to read a really outstandlingly wordy story."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I really disliked this one. It rambled and was difficult to read. If you hadn't read the previous books in this series it would be completely baffling. After many hundreds of pages, it ends in the middle of the story. A very cheap trick to get me to buy another book in this series. I'm not falling for it.LOUSY!"
3,"Day Tripper, yeah!","She took me halfway there. I HATE when books continue in another tome, yet the reader is not warned ahead of time. The author thus forces you to buy the second book. Guess what? I am requesting it from the library. Other than that Ms. Nelson Douglas has a masterful command of the language and the epoch and her Irene Adler sereis are most entertaining."
3,Half a book is better than none?,"I just want to warn unsuspecting fans that this book ends in the middle. If you like resolution in your mysteries, prepare yourself for disappointment. Nothing is resolved - all must wait on Ms. Douglas' next book. It seems a shoddy trick to play on loyal fans. My advice - wait til the next book and read the whole story at once."
2,A cheap ploy to sell a sequel !!,"I have never read an Irene Adler novel and so was intriqued by the idea of a Victorian female detective. I bought this to read on a long flight. To make this short - don't waste your money. After slogging through some of the most rambling, cumbersome prose I can imagine, waiting for all the threads to be joined, the book simply ends in mid-story! This was one of the most blatent ploys I have ever seen to get you to buy another book in this series. I found this so insulting that I would not buy another one of this authors books simply as a form of protest."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,What a big mistake. I talked my daughter (6 years) into picking this game thinking it would be fun for us to do together since I like the kid games better. She says it is to hard to get Cinderella to move and gave up after half hour of fumbling. So I sit down to play and beat the game in one hour ten minutes. Cinderella is very hard to move and has bad response time.You have two paths you can travel on and they put things in the way so you have to jump back and forth from one another.Then you are a mouse and you have to travel through tunnels and gears or something to finish ( This was the best part of the game )Then you have to pop bubbles.Anyway this game would probably be fun for a 3 year old IF she moved better but my 6 year old has trouble.Don't waist your money on this one.We bought magic Pegasus at the same time and this is a great game buy that one.
2,Not that easy,The game is fun and the graphics are good but it has a lot to read so my daughter is a 5 year old and she is always asking what it says in the screen so she needs help.
4,Good Quality Downtempo,"This isn't another cheesy, trying to be loungy but not really all that cool after you buy it CD. The first track starts off with a little bit of energy and organic beats and rhythms, it's really catchy. I bought this CD because of the song 'Clean' which I heard on an Internet radio station. A lot of the other songs are more mellow but also catchy in a way. I've found that a lot of other CD's will sound good for a week or two but this one still sounds good to date, not a CD that you can really get sick of."
3,Cute summer read!,"This book was not what I'd call an in-depth novel, but it offered a cute story to read for the summer. It is a tale told by a young man about his summer job and the people who worked alongside him at a Maine resort in the mid-1960's. I learned a little about the Maine coastal area and its summer tourists, and all the characters were memorable. There was not a huge climax in the story, but it was a nice little read. I could have done without the Maine accents - at times that detracted from what I was reading."
2,"OK, but not great","Entertaining story of life at a Maine resort ""back in the day"". Halfway through I found it getting a little tedious as each character was quite a character ! Didn't anybody even halfway normal ever come to that resort ? It was like a parade of kooks after a while.OK, kinda fun read. Nothing I'd ever read again."
3,Not bad,Not a bad read. His depiction of working class folks in Maine seems eerily similar to the people living in Appalachia.
4,Well Written and Amusing,"The writing of this book was good and there is nothing that I can criticize about the book - but this book didn't hold my interest the way I expected it to. The stories are amusing and personal, but I felt like I could have stopped reading at any time and just not cared. A good summer beach read for a lazy day, but not a must read."
2,Not what I expected,"This was one book that I kept reading mainly because I kept waiting for something to happen, which it didn't. A series of vignettes about summer employment in Maine, I was expecting some revelation to tie it all together, but it never came. The characters were well developed and interesting for the most part, but other than revolving around Andy, the main character, the pieces seemed to have little to do with each other. Couldn't wait to be done this one."
3,On and On,"The reviews were good and sounded like a great read. Granted, it did start out good .....but......unfortunately, in my judgement, it became tiresome and repetitive. I must admit after reading about 3/4 of thie book, I gave up and put it down. I may have missed a fascinating final fourth of the story but it turned out to be one of those stories that you eventually put down because there are way too many wonderful reads out there waiting to be read."
1,Caveat emptor!,"The editor, Andrew Ross, describes this book as ""an expanded edition"" of a special issue of the journal ""Social Text"". Potential readers should be warned however that it is also an expurgated edition, from which Alan Sokal's celebrated parody of recent socio-cultural jargon has been suppressed. One understands Professor Ross's chagrin at the cruel and unusual joke that Professor Sokal practised on him. However, the unadvertised deletion of Sokal's contribution is a hoax on the buyers of ""Science Wars"" who naturally expect to find in it the one item of the original publication that has received worldwide attention."
3,love of Sokal,"For those of you so bemused by the exclusion of Sokal's piece, take a look at his website. You can access it easily (ever try google?), and more importantly, you can get the article in which he explains his reasoning for the hoax. After all, the hoax piece is rambling nonsense (like much in Social Text, unfortunately); why would you want to read it anyway? It is his reasoning, which I disagree with, that is most important.As for the rest of the pieces, I think several represent an excellent contribution to the debate, which many may see is trite, but others, I feel, could gain quite a bit. As for ""Marxist biology,"" a phrase displaying wondrous ignorance, Levin's ""Ten Propositions"" are likely followed by most genuine scientists, thus quite important to read in my opinion. Not necessary to buy the whole book though, just read some Stephen Jay Gould, etc. to get a taste of critical scientific praxis in action :)"
4,Pilo Polo set,Product shipped on time and arrived promptly. We purchased THIS pilo polo set before and the cushions on almost all the sticks broke off within six months. This time we're hoping to cover them with duct tape to ensure longer use.
4,Hilarious..,"Horrible acting, terrible plots, but now at least I know porn isn't just an issue these days. It used to be every where. Definitely a funny collectors item in the grind house of cinema days."
3,"Bealls terrible, Tervis excellent","The cups themselves are excellent,I own many many Tervis. However, Bealls is terrible. They put tehse on sale, then take your money, then a few days later so they don't have any and yet, magically the next day they are full price and in stock. Their listings on amazon do not match up with inventory and I have been dissapointed 3 times and not received m6y order. Tervis highly recc. but don't buy from bealls."
3,Not dishwasher safe,"I love Tervis tumblers, as they completely eliminate condensation. I take exception to their claim they are dishwasher safe. Over time they crack and the adhesive eventually fails. This takes approximately two years. This is OK for the price paid, but I feel it is a misleading representation of the product.The lifetime warranty is meaningless, as one must pay for shipping, and it is just as economical to purchase new. I have seen a glass product in Chef's Catalog that has a one-piece double wall construction. This will be my next purchase."
4,Not what's pictured,"The Tervis cups are awesome. However, with this order the product that arrived is not the same as what is shown in the picture. The cups that arrived were pink, blue, green and yellow. Also, the chairs are the same color as the umbrella rather than being white as shown in the picture."
3,Not as pictured,"I love tervis tumblers. The decoration is not the same colors as pictured, which doesn't bother me since I'm not coordinating them with anything. But I do think the picture should be an accurate representation or a visible note should indicate that it not exact."
4,Young Rome DOES feature artists outide of his record label on the cd...,"He features Guerilla Black and YoungblooZ, what more could anyone ask for? The cd is very well-rounded, and i give it an 8/10. Freaky and Afterparty are 2 hit singles, and I Don't Care, Sexapade & Wha Cha Doin Tonight all have the potential to be hits if he can regain his popularity in 2005...."
3,Interesting,"It's hard to figure out what Rome is trying to do. He sounds like a cross between Mase, J'Kwon and Too Short. Some of the track are sexually charged. So if you are buying this for your child, you might want to get the clean version.Some of the songs:Freaky: Rome looking for the girls in the clubAfter Party: Is a little bit like Tipsy, so if you like that song, you'll like this one.Crazy Girl: Rome still looking for girlsIn My Bedroom: It does sound like a song Too Short would do, just a song about Rome and his girl in her bedroom.Sexapade: Rome and Marques talking about girls.Best Days: He talks about the good old days and mentions Half Pint (originally of Immature) and J-Boog, Fizz and Raz B (he claims to miss them-funny nothing is stopping him from talking to any of them). A great song.In My Car: Rome cruising in his car and seeing girls. This song will remind you of LL Cool J's Six minutes.Not a bad CD, but I wouldn't advise playing it in front of your parents."
5,HOTT!! HE'S DEFINATELY ALL GROWN UP!,I love the CD! It's Hott!! The beats are all hott! For his debut album I think he did pretty good. It's everything I expected and more. His rhymes and style is totally different from what he did when he was in Immature/IMx. This album shows another side of him which I think his fans have been waiting for. Make sure yall check it out. You won't be disappointed!
5,Young Rome,"Young Rome shocked me with his skills, the album turned out being different from what I thought it would be. I really liked the song ""In her bedroom"" featuring O'Ryan Omarion from B2K's younger brother. This song is real nice hopefully he makes it his new single. I also liked how on ""Best days"" he states how he misses the members of B2K who left TUG, I found it real sweet."
5,Dang this is a Hott CD,This CD is the Bomb.. i really like it.. he has nice beats and words and everything... he is doing better without the ImX Group.. I love the song after party...i like more song in that cd too.. but thats my fav...This CD is the bestJUne 25
5,Young Rome,I just love Young Rome. His cd Food for Thought is so good I just love it!!!! I suggest everybody buy this cd!!!!!!
5,the cd,= When i heard itReviewer: JsoSic from HoustonI personally bought the cd the first day it dropped and it didn't really surprise me as in being a great cd. The only thing that did surprise me was how personal the cd is to Young Rome he poured his heart out to the fans and supports. I recommend the cd to everyone clean version for the kids though lol...

3,3 STARS!!!!!!!!,I give this 3 stars cause of the lack of featured artists on the album. I'm sure he knows more people besides b2k and marques houston. I love Immature/IMx and I love the fact that he went solo. But he needs more people on his album.
1,Nothing Happens In This Movie.,"I went totally crazy over this movie when I saw the cover and I paid the full retail price. The idea of a young teanage boy having a relationship with a middle age Latina is something that makes me very interested. But, what happens in this movie is this--after wasting time for an hour, they finally get down to business. The couple make out and have sex. But, do we get to see it...? Answer. No! They do it first under a thick dirty plastic cover, which gives you only shadows. Then they do it outside the cover, and we get to see a shot of their faces as they moan. Are you kidding me?...I had exected some bold Mexican movie, like ""Sex and Lucia,"" where you get some real action. This, however, is whimpy, stupid, soap opera stuff. A waste of talent, money, and resources. Need I say more?"
5,Excellent Slicer,"Sturdy, strong, stable, and solid slicer. None of that floppy, bent nonsense. Worth every penny you will spend on it."
2,not for standard blocks of cheese,"I bought this based on previous reviews thinking that I could slice through a standard ""baby loaf"" block of cheese. No such luck. This is designed for those little premium cheeses that you put out at parties. I attempted to use this to slice pepper jack cheese. Not happening. Tore through the cheese instead of slicing. Took off huge chunks at the corners of the block. I figured it was the tiny bits of pepper it was getting hung up on so I tried regular old cheddar. Still took off corners in chunks. Not a good item for everyday cheese slicing for sandwiches. Does a great job on small cheeses that are only a total of about 3 inches wide."
1,disappointed,sturdy but dull blade makes it very difficult to actually slice cheese - it tears chunks of cheese off rather than slicing - thin slices are impossible...we're still using our very old and broken cheese slicer as it works so much better. I cannot recommend this product.
5,awesome,We are thrilled with our cheese slicer. It is definitely sharp and makes very nice slices with no residue crumbling off. It is easy to clean and store. Much better than the wire slivers. Highly recommend
4,Let's talk Menace,"Here is a roundup of songs from one the best bands,to exist in the original punk era. The band released classic songs on Small Wonder records in 77. These songs can be found on this compact disc. The band had a smooth sound mixed with clear precise vocals.The only thing negative about this cd is that it only has eleven songs. Some live tracks added to the cd would have landed this release an instant five stars."
3,wrong call,A twenty eight old New Yorker-an architect is looking for a job endlessly dreaming to move out from a mother's place while his sexual endeavors are more successful and he is hooked by the newly met old class-mate at last.A laughing-better-than-crying comedy belonging to a Jewish-hohma works is of a sweet-side NYC environment.
4,Why you should get this movie.,"The reason I love this movie is pretty simple. The movie overall is a date movie and is good, but most people won't like it if they expect to laugh through the whole thing. Sure there are funny spots, but the movie isn't great for those. It's great for the heartwrenching scenes with David Schwimmer and Gwenyth Paltrow. Including one particular sad one when they play Sheryl Crow's ""I Shall Believe."" David Schwimmer and Gwenyth Paltrow dance to this. When you see the movie you'll see why this scene is more heartwrenching than it is happy. So, if you are looking for a good movie that can pull on your heartstrings as well as make you laugh occasionally with Schwimmers hyjinx, then this is a good one for you."
2,take a nap,"The first 10 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. Endless long face shots of Schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. Occasional humor and the interest generated by Paltrow and Hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable.A 25 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,Paltrow's pathetic outfits and Hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. Michael Rappaport and that Bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive.As I review the film in my mind, Two stars might have been too high! Skip this one and enjoy an extra episode of Friends."
1,Without,"I am a fan of friends the show so when I saw that Shwimmer was in it I bought it. Mistake! I saw it while babysitting and they were like "" Why is he kissing that old lady "". It was bizarre, gross and all in all just wrong! Do not waste your time."
1,Not What I Thought!,"I thought I was buying music for The electric Slide, the dance that's popular at weddings, etc. This is a rap CD!!Doh!!"
3,dance lessons,"I only got this CD for the Electric Slide, but since I got this CD I can not remember how to do the dance that goes with it. Any one know where I can get them?"
3,it's okay........,"if your a dj it want hert to buy it,because you can't buy it on anything like imesh or itune's ."
2,Electric Slide,"The only selection I cared for was the Electric Slide, the rest of it is not up to par."
1,"I ordered this zippo, and they sent me another","Well... I'm very worried, because i ordered this zippo, and you sent me, one of the world poker tour, but not this one, and that's not what i askedPlease, i really want this zippo, and that doesn't deserve a good rate from me, at least answer me to know why did you sent me something that i didn't ordered"
2,"Sylvie Good, Arrangements and Guest Vocalist Bad","I first became aware of Sylvie Lewis from a poster hanging in Fingerprints, a terrific Long Beach, California record store. I went to her show shortly thereafter in November 2005 at the Hollywood Café and enjoyed it. She sang, played the guitar, and was accompanied by a jazz-type drummer and either an electric bass or guitar. Since I enjoyed the show I went out and purchased this album. After a couple of listens I threw it in the discard bin. The main problem is the cheesy arrangements and some horrible guest ""singer"" who appears on the latter half of the album. Who is this guy? No, I don't want to know. Well, maybe I do so that I can avoid him in the future. Anyway, Sylvie's vocals are fine on the album, but I just couldn't get past the arrangements. Some of them sound like a theme from an 80s sitcom."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this watch for my daughter at Christmas. One month later it has had to be reset because of losing time on many occasions, the battery has been changed once and now it's failed again. The Timex warranty page gives no clue as to how to contact them, except for an address to send the watch for repair, and, of course, it is now too late to return the item. For a $30 watch, the cost of sending it for repair is not worth it. The batteries cost $15 so I don't want to get another, and I think this watch is going in the trash.I am disappointed. I bought Timex because of its reputation for reliability, so I feel let down. I also wish that Amazon had a better warranty program for this kind of item, which often doesn't manifest problems until the return period has expired and it's been used for a while. I think that the money they'd lose by refunding the cost of the item would be more than recouped by increased customer trust."
1,DISAPPOINTED,THE WRIST BAND AND THE WATCH FRAME HAVE ALREADY LOST THE COATING ON THE STEEL PARTS. THE WATCH ITSELF IS FINE AND I ONLY WANTED IT FOR WORK...SO I'M NOT FEELING SO FUSSY...BUT I DO NOT RECOMMENED THIS ITEM TO ANYONE AND I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE TO BUY ANOTHER LIKE IT.
4,Nice looking watch!,I gifted this watch to a very close family friend and she loves it. I like the gold chain and the date indicator!
3,Timex Woman's T2H351 Gold-Tone Expansion Band Watch,"I have worn women's Timex watches for many years. This is also an indiglow watch. I really like the indiglos because I can press a button and see the time in darkness. There is one drawback, though. The stem is very difficult to reset the date or time. It can be frustrating. If you have a hard time seeing the tiny date, take a look before you buy."
4,Easy to Read,"I love this watch because it is so easy to read, however this is the 3rd watch identical, because the light always burns out and this is the first one that actually kept the correct date--although I had to get out my magnifying glass to read it.Despite it's flaws I have been unable to find another watch I like as well and will probably deal with not being able to read the date and replacing it every year when the indiglo stops working."
4,watch,I like the basic style and the fact that timex is inexpensive yet I can count on it for years.
4,wish it lasted longer,"My only complaint about this watch is that it doesn't last very long. I'm about to order my third watch of this model. On each watch, the backlighting feature has failed after 1-2 years and the watch completely died after 3-4 years. That said, except for the tiny date it's easy to read and it has the features I want- a second hand and backlighting, and the cost is low enough. However, I would rather pay somewhat more and know the watch would work longer."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I got this watch for my 89 yr. old mother with Alzheimer's who also has eye problems. She is able to see the bigger numbers and is so proud of herself when she can tell me the time. It gave her a mental boost to be able to continue to tell time. I did have to take some of the links out as she has a small wrist but that was no problem.
3,Perfect except for band removal,"I love this watch. It is perfect in almost every way--clear, attractive face, light-up feature for dim places, lovely gold-tone band and back, keeps excellent time. The only difficulty was that it was impossible to remove links that needed removal to make the watch fit properly, so it cost me an extra $10 to brng it to a Timex store to have these links removed. Now, it is completely satisfactory. I think a refund of $10 would be fair. Then I would be rate to give this purchase five stars"
3,Timex Ladies Watch,"Very nice looking watch but wristband is much too small. Needs another inch to be comfortable. Keeps accurate time & date. Indiglo works great, handy in the dark."
3,"Great watch, poor battery","I purchased this watch for my Mom. It was packaged perfectly and arrived in fine condition. Unfortunately, the battery was depleted in less than a week. Although I know there is no way to determine longevity of a watch battery, it was still a disappointment."
1,Comfortable but light quit working in less than two months.,"I love Timex watches. This one is comfortable and easy to read. However, the light quit working in less than two months. Very odd. Maybe I will return it. Very disappointed."
4,watch,"Even with my small wrist, this thing was too tight. I'm hoping it will loosen up over time. I like the watch, though."
3,OK - but . . .,"A very handsome, easily read watch which was exactly what was wanted.However, the instructions were printed in 6 point type which made them extremely difficult to read.And it was impossible to set the date because the stem pulled completely out of the watch."
3,timex women's watch needs longer band.,the band is tight wish I could have found a longer band as it is almost too tight to wear. like the face easy to read and indigo light great.
3,watch works,"watchWatch works as it should. Looks as described. Illuminated dial easy to see, but can be accidentally depressed while wearing the watch, thus causing undetermined amount of unexpected battery usage. Watch band works as it should."
3,band too big,"Unfortunately, the band on this watch was too big for me - I do have small wrists - and we couldn't figure out any way to adjust it. I had ordered it specifically because so many reviewers had said it fit small wrists. So it was disappointing and I had to send it back. The face is a little bigger than I normally prefer, but I was willing to overlook that if it fit. At least it would have been easy to read, and I liked the date feature also. I'm sure for the money it would have been a fine watch."
3,two things wrong with the watch,"i rili shuld give this watch 5stars, judging from the package it came in, quality and condition. got it for my sis and i didnt even av d wrist problem seen in most reviews. but the watch seems to work only wen its being worn(meanin u av to set the watch errfin u take it off) Also, the indiglo light seems to dim after being used a couple of times. Other than this, 9ce watch"
3,A male's view,"I bought this watch, and the pictures on the product page are misleading. The picture of the watch beside the measurements is completely false, and tells you that the watch is bigger than it really is. The measurements listed in the description are correct though.I am a male with small wrists and wanted a stretchy gold watch to wear. I had tried the women's version with the oval face, and the normal men's version at my grandparents house, and the women's version fit me much better. So I went to Amazon and found the original women's version, which in the picture with measurements, seemed bigger. The fact of the matter is that in real life the face and the band are much smaller.When I light the Indiglo on it, it seems like the paper is lifted up down near the 6, which leaves a shadow when you light the Indiglo.Overall this watch is really cool, and I will wear it, but the picture on the product page is literally just wrong."
4,good watch,"This watch is just as it is advertized. I was pleased with it. I had it shortened , put it on and away we went."
4,Timex Women's T2H352 Easy Reader Gold-Tone Expansion Band Watch,"The watch is stylish, easy to read and keeps good time. I'm giving this watch 4 stars because the expansion band is too tight. I wear it every day but have to make sure to adjust the band just right, otherwise it pinches my wrist. One (or two) additional links would make this watch a perfect fit."
2,review of the book elementary quantum chemistry by Pilar,I bought this book after a recommendation by my mentor when I wan doing my master degree in computational chemistry. Overall this book was not useful for me. It does not have the mathematical expansions that are shown in other books such as the book by Ira levine. I do not recommend it for learning quantum chemistry but instead buy the book by ira levine.
2,This movie was not really good,"This movie is very unrealistic, however I like this movie because it reminds me of Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare (not the bats the terrorists). This movie has a terrible story, Russian terrorists are using Bats as a weapon and America is sending in Spec Ops to stop them. This movie isn't completely terrible, the action scenes are moderately entertaining, I mean you won't die if you watch this movie. I've seen this movie twice and don't hate it, but am definitely not a die hard fan. This movie is on the sci-fi channel and if you've seen their movies you know what its like. The effects are just okay but the action scenes are pretty unrealistic.Now the DVDThe DVD does not have too many extras, in fact all it has is a few deleted scenes. I don't recommend you buy the DVD without watching the movie. (It can be seen on the sci-fi channel)."
1,"It's BAD, VERY BAD.",This film is one of the worst of all times. The fighting and shooting scenes look absolutely fake. The acting is so terrible it seemed the actors and actresses were reading the dialogues from a book! The special effects are like ... NO EFFECTS at all. There's no suspenseful or scary moment either.It should be zero star. I regret renting this.
3,"Not bad, but her best tracks aren't here","This is a lost opportunity. Roxanne Shante's best tracks were the three singles she released before her first album. Only the first one, 'Roxanne's Revenge' is here, and it was always the weakest of the three.If you want to hear Shante at her very best, then the two following single releases 'Queen Of Rox: Shante Rox On' and the apocalyptic 'Bite This' are the tracks to find. It's incredible that they're not on here.The tracks that are here are some average tracks from her debut album, (in which she went for the mainstream and lost what made her good), and better ones from the second album, which included her fourth and last classic track, 'Big Mama'. Not bad overall, and better this than nothing, but without those two singles, this is a very flawed compliation."
3,"Good, but could have been better","Roxanne Shante', by no doubt is one of the Queens of hip hop and I have always loved her work. This is a great album and it showcased many of her early hits, but I just wished that this greatest hits collection could have included some of her freestyles that she used to do at her concerts. She used to battle the Cold Crush Brothers, UTFO, Real Roxanne, and others. Other than that, this was a great album for many of her fans to hear."
5,A Joyful Experience,"Some people may think humor and religion do not mix, but Barbara Eubanks, author of ""Humorous Happenings in Holy Places,""is not one of them. She has documented 101 incidents that have been observed or have happened to her, as wife of a minister, to her husband, children and grandchildren which are delightful and uplifting to read. It's those out-of-place happenings in church, such as an intruding horsefly, bird or dog causing havoc among the choir or the congregation that bring on the laughs. Author Eubanks has caught the essence of ""what right at the wrong time or what's wrong at the right time"" which accounts for much of the humor. She seems to be saying that God has given us the ability to laugh at ourselves, for when He created us He created humor as a sunny companion. The book carries one beyond humor, however, to related Scriptures which can be used in daily devotionals. Excellent work.Kenneth HutchesonColorado Authors' League"
4,A nice guide...,A nice guide to aeronautical people from Darrol Stinton... Easy-to-read texts and lots information especially for junior and senior students of the field....
2,boring,this book was rather boring.. the ending was pretty much depicted within the last five pages.. there was no background no reasoning no nothing
5,Lord of the Flies,All in all a great read that leaves you wanting moreIt is slow to start but just keep going it gets a lot better.
4,great movie if you like nsync,This movie is a great movie if you like nsync because it shows that theycan do more than sing. Also there is a big surpise at the but i don't want to spoil it for any nsync fans who havent seen it.
4,I enjoyed it!,"I wouldn't classify this movie as something only teenagers and preteens would enjoy. I am a 32-year-old college graduate who thought the movie was quite good, and I'm not sure what all the bad buzz was about. True, Lance and Joey will probably never win Oscars, but that's true about the majority of actors. They certainly did as well as, if not beter than, most actors out there.Give me ""On the Line"" over ""Vanilla Sky"" (that's two hours or my life I'll never get back!) any day.I look forward to Lance's next movie -- and I'll admit it, I think he's hot!!"
3,Hmmm,"I bought this movie just because it starred the Lance! (I'm sad!) It's never been released in theatres in the UK - that I know of, and when I watched this DVD I was left a little disappointed. It's v.cheesy and could have been so much better.Good story line, just a shame it has such a ""Teen People"" feel to it."
2,"Even though it looks good, it isn't 14th april 2004.","To be honest i never really watched it all, i watched half through it and i didn't find it enjoyable. How it sounds and looks is different than when you see it. I was a little dissapointed because i thought it would have been that bit better. It wastes too much time on where he wants to see her again. It may seem good to some people, but really it isn't that much of a comedy, it seems slow as you watch it. Ok to watch just the once, but i couldn't really get used to it. I have watched films like this before, and have realy enjoyed them and i was abit surprised over this. I SUPPOSE IT IS GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT HOW IT LOOKS ISN'T HOW IT SEES."
2,A real time waster,"My parents met eachother 33 years ago on the ""EL"" which is the only reason I could even stand this movie which is just so syrupy and predictable.(Was there any doubt that Kevin would get the girl?) And where did he get the money for those ads when it seemed like his job involved little else but fixing the copy machine? There were two bright spots: the hilarious Jerry Stiller and the ""behind the scenes"" with a cameo by Justin Timberlake & Chris Kirkpatrick.one more thing: it's the ""EL"", not ""L train."""
2,OK if there's is absolutely nothing else to do,"This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen. However, it's pretty down on my list. The plot is way too predictable. There aren't any surprises. Joey Fatone made an idiot of himself in this movie by acting like a rock n' roll psycho. If you're a fan of Joey, you'll probably puke at seeing him in this. During the movie, my eyes kept wandering off the TV screen and looking around the room. There just isn't any excitement. The plot is corny. Lance meets a girl on the subway and talks to her for ten minutes at the most. Then he spends the rest of the movie looking for her. By the end of the movie they kiss as though they were in love. However, the Justin and Chris from Nsync sneak a hilarious appearance at the very end of the movie. Yeah-that's the one thing that'll make you laugh. As I said, this wasn't the worst movie ever, so that's why it's 2 stars and not 1."
3,Was not the greatest movie on earth but it was really cute,I liked the movie. I thought it was cute and I thought Lance and Joey did a pretty good job. This really is a girl flick and if you liked movies like Simply Irresitable or She's All That then you would like this movie.
3,"Not too dang bad, but.......","I don't see it going for an Oscar or something. Come on, they know that the majority of people going to see this will be teenies so they can't have the long sex scenes and stuff like that. But if you want a movie where you can just watch and actually feel pretty light after, this is one of those. Now, I admit: I've been to two N'Sync concerts and I thought that I'd be classified as a teenie myself since I wanted to see it. But you know, Lance is pretty good, considering I don't think he had a day of acting lessons. Joey is just very close to his own personality, which I thought was great. Chris and Justin at the end was hilarious. I laughed like an idiot. Thank God no one was home. I would have gotten plenty of looks! (""I want them to see this hair in China! CHI-NA!"")But if you want to have a girlie night or want mindless fun, this is a good movie to choose."
1,Very Wack Film,outside of Joey Fatone showing a little Acting Cred there isn't alot going on with this film.Lance Bass is the kind of actor that would be lucky to be a fill in on a Low-Budget Soap Opera let alone star in anything.the best thing for me about this film was Al Green Performing.
2,"Bad plot, so-so acting","""On The Line"" turns out to be another neer-do-well romantic comedy, such as Sarah Michelle Gellar's nauseating performance in ""Simply Irresistable"" and the basic brainless fluff that ""Serendipity"" basically was.I'll give the movie credit for some things. One, Joey Fatone and Lance Bass (from the Grammy-nominted 'N Sync band) can act reasonably well. Second is the fluffernutter happy ending that usualy accompanies such films as these. But the plot suffers from major cliches and is just a basic recycling of the long line of romantic comedies before it.An Chicago ad salesman (Bass) is shy around girls and don't know how to meet them, along with his brainless friend (Fatone). Then, he meets Miss Right, and the usual chaos happens.""On The Line"" isn't that bad because Bass and Fatone can act well, for the major part of the film. But, it's predictable, brainless, and just plain corny. If ""On The Line"" had an original plot, it would have fared better.But it didn't. Too bad."
4,G & S Hits realy are,My favorite songs are included here. The recordings are of good quality. I can imagine easily the scenes during which they take place. This is a very enjoyable collection that even reproduces well while gardening.
3,This book is ok,This book is just average. It is made mostly of mediocre type short stories. Not one of my favorites.
4,text book,"I ordered this book for my daughter's advanced writing class. It arrived very quickly, even though it was a holiday week. There were a couple of papers left in the book from the previous owner, but the book was in excellent condition. Thank you for the expediency of this purchase!"
1,Takes forever to Dry,"THis dryer takes forever to dry. We have to run towels through for 2 hours and they still come out damp and then go sour. We have run the dryer disconnected from the vent to ensure no blockage, had repair people come by look and calleed LG and no help. Sevice guys say it blows hot air so should dry ($180), LG says wipe the inside off (duh), we are geting nowhere and are about at the end of our rope. Don't buy this dryer. Life is not good."
1,A dryer that doesn't dry!,"Ok it never drys my clothes all the way the first time, even on the highest settings... for the $ I expect this dryer to work. It can't save energy if I have to use it 3 times per load. My cheap POS worked better and my clothes were warm and dry when I opened that one. Buyer beware, this dryer SUCKS!"
2,disappointeduh,"I dont want to bash LCD too much because I do like a lot of the beats and music on the record, though unoriginal at times - but why oh why does the singer have to utter the ""duh"" sound after every word he says. It gets to the point that it's all I can hear while listening to it, that annoying ""uh"". I dont see how this cant bother the average listener, almost every word being over-annunciated makes it sound very pretentious or like the singer has the flu or something.I will give the CD a chance to grow on me but didnt think I would have to from the other rave reviews....it doesnt live up to the hype-uh."
2,we already did this in the 80's didn't we?,"Ok, I'll give it 2 stars for being well-produced and catchy, BUT it's a direct ripoff from New Order, Bronski Beat, Pet Shop Boys, Erasure, and later followers Daft Punk, Moby, etc. Even Talvin Singh and Kid Loco had that niche well (re)covered since the late 90's.Liberating swifty licks/beats from other artists is nothing new, I just don't understand the flood of kids that think this groundbreaking."
3,Too late to rock,This is the same formula used by bands like the Rapture and Radio 4 from a couple of years ago.There's nothing new to their sound. They just arrived too late.You can't really rock nor dance...the cd just goes from one song to another without making it easy to follow a pattern. It would be better if you buy 2 good records separetely; one pure electro/dance and one pure rock.
1,Know Your History,"Hello? Contortions anyone??? James Chance did this whole shtick 25 years ago, only with 9 million times more soul, passion and talent. Wake up kiddies."
1,What kind of CRAP is this?,"Ok I too heard all the hype for this album. Ok there are 2 catchy songs ""Too Much Love"" and ""Great Release"", but other than that this album is one of the worst I heard this year, if not ever. this guy has no talent besides putting loops together. His mono-tone voice is like listening to nails on a chalk-board, too nasal to flow with the attempted smoothness of the songs on this album. I have a feeling this guy is succesful simply because people listened to his songs because they were new, and swear up and down this is the new face of music. If this is the new face of music I might as well shoot myself now!"
1,ALL HYPE NO TALENT,"I am suprised to see so many people supporting this crap. Two or Three tracks that are ok. But no way would I spend money on them. I make better beats than this messing around on fruity loops for half an hour. And the lyrics, kind of funny I guess. Oh well just my opinion. Those who gave this five stars are probably on drugs. If you're one of them and are reading this, please put down your crack pipe and give me some other examples of what you listen to so I can look it up and have a laugh."
1,Because I can't give it Zero Stars,"I checked out the samples from napster, amazon, wal-mart.com. (amazon loaded fastest) And I have to say...this is pure unadulterated crap. If I had to choose between listening to this steaming pile of excrement or jabbing a pair of garden shears into my ear hole.....but I digress.I understand that some people like techno/electronica/trance...noise (it can't be called music) I'll even own up to buying a chemical brothers CD. But the main difference between those pieces of trash and this piece of trash is that none of those had a bald white guy with a sinus infection spitting a whining monotone over what sounds like someone beating the crap out of a '72 ford pinto to express his dissatisfaction with modern music."
3,the first disc is incredible....,"Sorry to say the same cannot be said of the second disc of early singles. I am obviously in the minority with that belief, as most reviews I have seen here seem to favour the singles on disc two. They to me are jokey, samey, and thin sounding. Now of course I do realise this is all part of some movement that never really caught on called Electroclash, and is supposed to sound ""dated"" and ""Eighties"". I read enough music magazines to know that much. But I was in high school in the 80's , and this sure doesn't sound like the dance music we listened to. Having said that, I am absolutely crazy about the first disc. While LCD Soundsystem obviously wear their influences on their sleeves ( fans of artists like Wire, Can, Gang of Four and Brian Eno will spot them ) they could have certainly picked worse artists to be influenced by."
3,Over-rated but still nice,This album is kind of over-rated. It was weird to here a guy do that music with the Dance type music. It was still a nice CD and it is one that I like but it is not as good as people say.
4,It grows on you.,"I was irritated with this CD at first and felt it was grossly overhyped. But, it grows on you. LCD/JM knows its history and deftly pays homage to a range of styles from elders and contemporaries. He's flaunting it without taking himself too seriously. Give it a few listens before rushing to judge (as I initially did). It's a good album, it just needs to breath a bit."
4,After an interesting review session,"I just recently read ""Bob""'s comments above (the first available) and found them to be quite interesting if not justified. It seems that he has taken the opportunity to terrorize a songmaker that is gifted with complex style and listenability. Well, all is fair in reviews I guess, however I believe this CD deserves a rebuttal.Mostly, this disk has fantastic tunes, sounds, and interjected words. I don't think its the greatest disk ever made - yet it stands out as an impressive collection of wonderful ideas. If you are into punk rock and electronic music it might make for a good listen (at least for the first 20 or so times).Bob - keep listening to those wonderful other bands you like so much."
1,Delivery of Incomplete Product,"Was very disappointed when this arrived from seller and feel fortunate that I checked the contents instead of just filing away for use later. The CD packet was missing upon delivery which makes the book pretty much useless. Very pleased as usual with Amazon for making this right but the seller/shipper should have much better quality control to ensure that this does not happen!! As a result, would never order from this particular seller again."
2,For Beginners...,"...and not really suitable for experienced Work-Shop leaders. I tried this book to get a sense of the quality of the books in this series. Personally I consider this book as too basic, and I must say that the quality of the provided material, such as for instance the slides, is not the standard I would expect. I would recommend this book for not so experienced trainers or people that would want to run an inhouse workshop for their own team."
5,"Emma, Who Saved My Life","This is one of the most delightful books I have had the pleasure of reading. Mr. Barnhardt's understanding of the fascination that draws thousands of young people to New York to find fame and fortune in the world of arts, letters and the theatre and the tribulations, heartbreaks, joy, success and failure is uncanny. I am 61 and loved it. I gave it to my daughter who is 29 and she loved it. If you are at all interested in the world of arts and entertainment, try it. You'll love it."
2,"Emma, Who Bored Me Silly","I don't understand the enthusiasm for this book. Although we are told ad nauseum how fascinating and edgy Emma is, she -- like the narrator -- is simply a grind, an average girl who works in a pizza parlor, writes bad poetry, and is kitted out with a formulaic mennu of traits that scream Early 70s Youth. The three main characters are shoved from scene to scene like a trio of theater props, which might work if the scenes rose above the level of predictable cliche (Fag Hag Party, Crummy New York Apartment, The Agony and Ecstasy of Off Off Off Broadway, The Drug Scene, etc.) For me, this book held all the sparkle of a rather stale TV sitcom. Whatever impulse I had to laugh (there are two or three genuinely funny observations in the 400 pages)was crushed by the narrator's constant badgering pose -- FIND ME FUNNY! SEE HOW IMPISHILY CLEVER I AM! BET YOU WONDER WHY I'M NOT WRITING FOR LETTERMAN! No, actually, I didn't wonder. Not once."
4,"""You want five hundred dolla?!!!""","This is one of those unusual silly comedies in which you laugh like it's laughing gas. I got a kick out of it straight through. It's politically incorrect, and that's what makes it so good. Alongside films like ""Pineapple Express"" and ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"", this never gives in to sappy Disney-like innocence. The stereotypical Asian-Indian driver and the circus freaks are a couple of prime examples. And hey, it's COMEDY! We're suppose to laugh at this, not philosophize on it! Anyway, this is a good comedy that surprisingly features one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances (but don't expect any ""Donnie Darko"" drama anywhere here)."
4,Bubble Boy had me laughing!,"With all due respect to those who are ill with the Immune Deficiency Disease, I found Bubble Boy to be funny. I don't think the movie pokes fun at the issue at all, but rather sheds light on those who struggle with the disease. By the end of the flick, my heart went out to Jimmy (bubble Boy) and his quest to save his dream girl from a mulletman! I took my little cousin to see it and we were both laughing. Bubble Boy is a silly romantic comedy,and the humor is what our younger generations are used to. Naturally, not everyone is going to find it amusingly appealing, but for those of us who enjoyed flicks like There's Something About Mary, Dumb & Dumber and Road Trip, I definitely recommend seeing Bubble Boy. Jake Gyllenhaal is a talented actor and i'd like to see him take on other roles as well. The rest of the crew was funny too -- Mini Me, Beetlejuice, Fabio. Check it out for yourself."
5,Bubble Boy,"This movie is hilarious! Jake Gyllenhaal plays, Jimmy, a young man who has lived in a bubble all of his life because he has no immunities. When Jimmy's love interest decides to marry someone else, Jimmy must cross the country to get to Niagra Falls to stop the wedding. Of course, he meets many new faces and adventures along the way. This movie makes me laugh no matter how crappy the day is so if you are interested in slap stick comedy, buy it and watch it with your friends. Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as usual. This actor's range is impressive..how'd Donnie Darko go from living in a bubble to being a gay cowboy? It is just neat."
4,Funny movie,"This is just silly movie and it was a good price. It was a hit with the family, so recommended!"
2,Too goofy for me,At first I had hopes of enjoying a good comedy but sticking with it wore me out with the over the top silliness. I would recommend this to viewers that are not offended easily and are entertained with far-fetched comedy.
3,wut,"This is a weird movie about a boy trapped in a bubble due to his lack of immune system. Overall the movie is funny, but the ending was appalling. Spoiler ahead - we find out that Bubble Boy's immune system has been okay since he was four (when he was brought home from the hospital) and Mom didn't tell him because she wanted to keep him at home. What stumped me was Dad's complicity in this plot, so I had to give this movie a 3 for the ending."
5,Great comedy,"I waited years to see ""Bubble boy""and wish I didn't.Gyllenhaal and Kurtz are wonderfull.The movie has a nice ending,and what a fantastic adventure the bubble boy takes us across the country trying to stop the wedding of the love of his life."
3,funny,the funniest part of the movie is in the beggining of the movie when bubble boy hits his crotch with a bat
1,horrible,"Bubble Boy was the most pathetic movie ever. How anyone enjoyed it is beyond me. In the movie, A boy named Jimmy has disease in which he can't touch any germs, so they put him in a bubble. When the girl he loves moves to get married in Ney York, he makes his bubble portable and goes to New York to stop the wedding.As if the plot of the story isn't dumb enough, bad acting and pitiful directing make this movie a total disaster. Never see this movie in your life time, for you will be overcome with boredom."
2,Sorry couldn't laugh,"Usually I try and give movies the benefit of the doubt, I really do try. This one just didn't make me laugh. There are bad movies that you can watch and still like. Then there are movies that are so bad they make you want to cry. I didn't laugh at the movie I laughed at its attempts to be funny.Overall-Think of this movie as a vampire and me as the vampire hunter. If the occasion ever arose for the oppunity for me to hunt this monster there are several things I would do1. Drive a steak through the movie's heart(in this case represented by a vampire)2. Cut off its head3. Dismember the body, burn the pieces and then scatter the ashes at a crossroads so that it would do no harm to the viewing public ever again.Bottom line Save your money"
1,A Lemon!,"Some parents are so protective that they would like to stick theri kids in a giant bubble.Thats exactly what Jake's mum does.Chasing the girl he loves he takes off in a bubblesuit...But I have got to tell you,I loathe this movie.If you want to watch a really funny,good comedy,choose just about anything else!!! This is weird."
1,Ridiculous!,"I rented this movie due to the high ratings it has. I was really looking forward to watching it and was very dissapointed to find it so absolutely awful. I watched about an hour, hating every minute, and finally decided to turn it off. I am not the type of person who abandons books or movies and usually feel that I have to finish them, even if I'm not enjoying them that much. I just couldn't do it with this one! Yuch!"
4,love story,"This movie is about a boy, Jimmy Livingstion (Jake Gyllenhaal from October Sky), who was born with a faulty immune system, so he as to live in a plastic bubble almost his entire life. He falls in love with his childhood sweetheart and next-door neighbor, Chloe (Marley Shelton from Sugar and Spice), who provides a breath of fresh air but is about to get married to another guy. Jake Gyllenhaal says, ""It's a wonderful love story-a freaky, awesome ride with crazy characters."" I give this movie 4 stars because I only know about the main plot and the stars and I haven't seen it yet."
3,Silly movie,"Obviously this is going to be a silly movie, but I bought it for my kindle when I had an electrical outage. It passed the time and was decently amusing."
4,an okay movie - I guess..,I seen this movie on Saturday and at first I was mostly appauld at the way the movie pokes fun at people who are different. But once I relaxed and got into the movie I have to admit it was really funny. I wouldn't go back to see this nor will I rent it on video -but- I have to admit it was funny...
1,"Oh, my.","So incredibly bad it's BAD. This movie has to fall into the catagory of 'A dog with no legs or tail.' My wife has a crush on Jake Gyllenhaal is my only defense for sitting through the whole thing which was hard enough due to the fact that the film acctually produces anti-laughter. The 1 star is for a flick actually having a character named ""Dr. Phreak."""
2,embarassing,"I can't beleive all the good reviews this movie is getting.This is truly medicore.Mabey there are people out there that enjoy this movie, but they are proboly mostly airheads!Please stay away and watch a good comedy such as the Monty Python movies!"
4,a first Harlequin Macomber novel,"The Matchmakers is Debbie Macomber's first book for Harlequin Books. If you have read her other stories, written later in her career you can see the growth, so that alone, especially if you are a fan of her writing makes this interesting. That also is probably why some would judge this not her best. The plot varies in that the lady, a widow, Dori Robertson is in love but the guy, Gavin doesn't want to be and only realizes at the end that he does indeed care for her. I'm really not giving anything away, because this is the basic plotline of these romances; boy meets girl, they fall in love, have a falling out and reunite for a happy ending. There is also the frequently used plotline of matchmakers putting the couple together, the children as the matchmakers. Don't think this is a criticism, the books and stories are addictive and you will develop a fondness for the characters and wish the book went on for more pages, so that's another plus - a likeable Macomber book"
3,keep your money,"I figured it would work better because it was created for guys who, on average, have oilier complexions than women. Nope. Not the case at all. It feels nice, sure, but nowhere near as good as I would expect from this company."
3,Not as good as their previous effort,"When I finally found this book, I was hoping for a resource as wonderful as their ELIZABETHAN COSTUMING book. While it's got good information in it, I found the some of the illustrations and multitudinous typos to be distracting. It's also rather dated -- in their section on corsetry, they advise purchasing a corset or alternative -- such as a longline bra or merry widow. We've come a long way, what with the proliferation of pattern companies specializing in period costume! However, this is a good book for someone who is just starting out in Victorian Costuming. While the illustrations appear to have been done in a hurry, they are quite clear, and they do give a bit of a ""Reader's Digest"" version of what was going on in the time period and how it related to what you'll be making. The instructions are clear. However, it's not as comprehensive as their Elizabethan book."
2,A PRETENTIOUS BORE,"Savage Grace has such an interesting plot, but the characters and script are anything but interesting. The movie even put me to sleep toward the end, it was so boring. I'd say the only good thing about the film are a few explicit sex scenes. Those scenes, however, are not reason enough to see the movie. Avoid."
4,sad saga ok movie,"This film version of the baekeland saga is somewhat of a mishmash for me.I belive julianne moore is great as is the rest of the cast the direction by tom kalin(swoon)is good.If you are interested in this case,perhaps read the book first then see the movie."
2,TEDIOUS IN THE EXTREME!!!,"This was one of the most tedious films I've seen in some time. The characters were so self-indulgent and unsympathetic that it was all I could do to continue watching. And there was something about the way Tom Kalin and his editor chose to structure the story that made it a lot of work to watch. I just couldn't connect with it. It was too incoherent, too taken with itself, too pretentious, too erratic. Kalin's earlier black and white film, SWOON, was a very nice, albeit low budget take on the Leopold and Loeb story (a finely crafted experimental approach at that). This, on the other hand, felt like a shrill bucket of cold water didactically dumped on my head! Rent, don't buy."
1,Glad I only rented it!,"In my opinion, this is a great example of a film which did NOT have to be either conceived, filmed, produced, or released. Although it may be interesting to the curious few, the lack of redeeming features is what is remembered. Like other reviewers, I can't understand why ANY of the actors, both well and little-known, would agree to perform in such a needless and depressing venture. As some reviewers have already said, the characters are underdeveloped (for that we should be glad, incidentally)so that the viewer couldn't care less about what drives them to act the way they do.Oh, for a good psychiatrist...preferably before the fateful Chinese food order!Do not waste your time and possibly your sweet nature with this gloomy glop!"
3,Savage Grace,Interesting film about some interesting people doing interesting things in interesting places. A tough role for Julianne Moore who did more than just carry the story. Nice cinematography.
2,Grace - Give me a Break,"The disk worked fine, but the contents of the film where not at all about what I hoped for. It is primarily for homosexuals. The Mom-Son was just to too dark and ends all wrong. Boys who like boys will just love it."
1,Filth,"This movie is beyond obscene! The plot is measly, but the over-the-top pornographic images and sounds are filmed to make a huge impact. This film is nothing but gratuitous filth."
2,Should have been so much better.,"There's an interesting story to be told about Barbara Baekeland, the socialite from a working class background, but this isn't it. Done in an episodic nature, told from her son's point of view, the choppy narrative and unappealing characters makes for a slow, dull viewing.Points for making one want to know more about this woman, her life, her family. And Julianne Moore gives another brilliant performance, elevating the movie as much as possible."
2,dysfunction,"A selfish man and a selfish woman produce a selfish son with serious issues.Another title for this movie could have been, ""When Desires Go Bad.""This was a bad role for Julianne Moore. Playing a perverted mother shouldn't be good for your career."
5,Not for the Faint of Heart,"This is an excellent book, really illuminating as to what the Civil War soldiers endured. I disagree with the recommendation for 7th grade and up. Boys of that age may like it but it is truly more appropriate for the high school years. We study the Civil War in 11th grade (for the third time, there are so many good books available) and that is definitely when this book will be read.There are grisly photos and the text, which is very well written, covers many of the sickening details of war as well. These things are of value and should not be forgotten. However, I see no need to rub younger children's noses (and minds) in the mire of war. Let the unpleasantries of life unfold at an age where there is more discernment.It is a pity that the words across the top read ""Young Readers' History of the Civil War"". That phrase is misleading and should be struck from the cover. The book Fields of Fury is a far better choice for grades 4-8."
5,Excellent Read,"What an interesting book. We bought it for a book report. I, the mom, could not stop reading it until I finished it."
3,A Young Genius over Easy Mo Bee beats.....Hell yeah!,"While on a quest to collect the entire Cold Chillin' CD catalogue I came across the Words From The Genius. For all you die hard WU heads this album may not be for you. I would consider this LP somewhat of a novelty for all Wu fans. But don't sell the GZA short. On this album he delivers in classic Gza fashion. Rhymes are on point,the beats are a little outdated, but reflect the production style of the early 1990's. There is one guest appearance (The Rza) and only one song produced by the Rza. So don't expect another Liquid Swords album. Over all I'll give this album a 3.5. Vintage Easy Mo Bee production over a young Genius' rhymes. Classic."
3,they call him the genius for a reason,this album is a prime example of how a record company can shaft you. but its gza and yall know he got tight lyrics. -necro
3,Genius the kid,This cd is pretty good. But i dont feel the music in tha background. You know what i dont even know what the f i am talking bout. Never heard dis cd yet. Peace
3,Know Your Enemy,"If you read book you will know why Islam is an enemy of the non-muslim world.This religion has been a terrorist organization from its begining.Islam and muslims will never stop killing people who do not believe as they do, even other muslims."
1,"Outdated, biased and ignorant","This book is biased, unscholarly, and laughably inconsistent. It slams Islam for its violent past while turning a blind eye to Old Testament violence. It condemns Mohammed for not ever performing a miracle (this is for some Muslims one of Islam's selling points), and accepts unquestioningly the miracles of Jesus. If you are looking for an overview of Islam, there are a hundred better books out there, and I am shocked that this outdated book is being reprinted in our times as a scholarly investigation of Mohammed and his religion. I bought it for a quarter at a booksale for a laugh, but if I had known anyone was taking it seriously, I would not have paid so much."
1,Complete Fiction!,"Book is mixed with Fiction.I am a Christian who has read the Korran and think that this auther may have been on drugs while writing his book. We Chriistians need to learn to read on our own and judge for ourselves and stop listening to what 1 person writes down. When Jesus, or any prophet, was around most people did not like him.Think about it. Is a hater of Islam going to write a nice book on Islam than tell people this is a good religion? No! They are going to sound truthful, then mix lies to make the reader hate moslems. He, 1 person, wants us to hate Islam. The real enemy is Satan!! No where in this book does it say anything bad about satan. Hmmm."
3,Gotta love Julia,Alright this isn't an Oscar calibur type movie but it's got some B-movie potential. There is good wit and fun play and although it's a little jagged overall it's not a bad flick. Like it sez gotta love Julia
5,I Love Trouble dvd,"Excellent movie! Good mystery movie. Nick Nolte & Julia Roberts were great together. Has good comedy, deceint action, & good plot."
1,Disappointed,Its been over a month and I still haven't received the item I paid for. This is ridiculous. I'm absolutely not a satisfied costumer.
5,Watching This Flick....No Trouble At All :),"I have been looking for this movie forever as I have all Julia Roberts movies but trying to upgrade to DVD....and once again, Amazon does NOT disappoint...found it, ordered it and had it within a few weeks to watch and enjoy...love it love it love it....a rewarding experience...thanks : Oh and the movie is awesome, one of Julia's best even though not as many remember her in this as Pretty Woman, Erin Brockavich but sure fire winner to me...but I am biased, Julia is the best!"
2,I Love Trouble,"This movie was suppose to be the 'widescreen' version, but it's not. I would not have bought it otherwise. The product description needs to be changed so that you know what you are getting."
2,"This film might be cute, but it is not worth paying $8.99!","""I Love Trouble"" is an o.k. movie, but Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte seem like they are ""overacting."" The movie is likable, but it is too long to enjoy, and the ""cute factors"" are just too unlikely. Maybe I would buy it if it were $5.00, but not $9.00! SKIP IT."
4,well documented,"A relatively thorough going through of words from Greek-English, but would have been good if it also included an English-Greek addition. The definitions are not as complete for the needs of a new beginner but ample for an intermediate."
1,Blurry print,"The print in this book was so blurry that I had to send it back. Greek uses a lotof little accent marks, and you need clear print to be able to see them. It wasa huge mistake to compromise on the print quality."
2,Essential resource marred by sloppy printing/binding,"As others have said here, this edition is an essential resource for anyone studying/reading ancient Greek. Unfortunately, as in the case of so many others, my copy was printed by OUP in Spain and has several pages horribly marred by creases that make some entries illegible. Not really worth commenting on if mine were an isolated case. ""Mistakes are made"", as they say. But such apparently widespread sloppy workmanship by the printer, and obvious misanagement by OUP is really astounding."
3,Bad Printing,This lexicon is super easy to use and very handy however this particular print is bad. I am not quite sure but this may be one of those print on demand type things but the inside margins on many of the pates have been cut off making it very difficult to find certain words because the first two letters or so are cut off. Would not have minded this if it was cheaper and even though this is cheap for a lexicon it is just too bad that it cost this much for such a crappy printing.
3,Excellent translation help but mediocre printing,"The Intermediate Greek Lexicon based on Liddell and Scott (7th ed.) is a wonderful translatioin tool, with many difficult verb forms included and also basic source citations to help choose the correct sense. Additionally, it is of a size and weight that you can carry in your backpack or shoulder bag.However, OUP apparently contracted with a Spanish printing company to print the most recent printing, and both copies I received from Amazon had many pages that were wrinkled. It appeared to have happened after the printing (in the assembling and binding, perhaps), since the words on the pages were clear and complete, but it was disappointing. I expect OUP was trying to keep costs down, but quality suffered.BW."
5,Underrated Talent!,Tina Moore is a very under rated talent. She has a beautiful voice and was a victim of poor promotion.
5,Wonderfully funny movie,"Love this movie! After watching it on TV for the umptenth time, have decided to buy the DVD. It will be great to pull off the shelf for a good time! It's a humorous compilation of several good thriller/suspense movies, with a 1950-60s backdrop. Love the scene where they call recess during the courtroom trial."
4,"Trust your ""Instinct""","I first caught this movie on cable a few years ago and laughed so much my side started hurting! After that, I would watch it whenever I caught it on, sometimes missing half the movie but enjoying it just the same. If you like ""Body Heat"" ""Fatal Attraction"" and other movies of that ilk (which I do) you don't want to miss this spoof. It's all of those movies, rolled into one; the actors play it straight, which is more funny than if they had winked at the camera in each scene. The drama keeps rising with every scene, until it gets so ridiculous TWO people have to die in the end, simultaneously, and by the same hand."
4,A very funny movie.,"At the price I paid for the DVD, shipped, it was well worth it. This movie is hilarious. That's really all that can be said about buying a DVD I guess. heh"
2,A Title For Your Review,"I cant for the life of me work out how this film has gotten such good reviews? I love these slap stick kind of movies. But compared to the rest I've seen this Fatal Instinct holds no torch.I had never heard of this film till I saw it in the cheapie bin of a DVD clearence pile and upon reading it was a slapstick comedy I thought it was going to be a barrel of laughs like simmaler movies. I was wrong. It started off ok, but the more it went along, the less funnier it got. It didnt have anything I would consider to be lasting quality either.I give it 2 stars because it had a couple of bits I did laugh at, but this film could have been so much better.I'd rather recomend instead of this movie...- Kentucky Fried Movie- Airplane 1& 2 / Flying High 1 & 2- Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3- Repossessed- Silence Of The Hams- Spaceballs- HotShots 1 & 2- Scary Movie- Anything by Monty Python"
2,Sean Young is the best thing about this movie,"The film is well-intentioned, but David O'Malley is a lousy parody writer, cranking out jokes that make it seem like he wasn't even trying to make the movie funny and Armand Assante (although he proves he's good at comedy) is miscast. However, Sean Young, spouting a blond wig, is very attractive, sultry and hot in her role as seductive Lola Cain, and her character's beauty alone makes the movie tolerable every time it comes on Comedy Central. Bill Wine summed this movie up when he said,""Fatal Instinct is everything but funny."""
4,Bad Reviews? I Don't Know Why...,"This movie was slammed by critics. The most common review of this said that there was 'just too many jokes' in it. I watched it with a critical eye, and thought it was a really fun movie.I didn't laugh out loud with tears running down my face, but did spend the entire run time giggling at the antics of all the characters. The cast consists of several Serious Actors (Kate Nelligan, Armand Assante) who play their parts as though they were in a drama. To me, those are excellent comedic acting skills. It's when actors play for laughs that they are not funny.You might not be tickled by this one if you aren't familiar with the 'film noir' and detective film genre. If you are a fan of those, you will laugh as you recognize all the devices in those films over-used to good effect in this one.I had a good time watching it...give it a try!"
3,Funny Movie,It is a movie that is a take off from the real McCoy movies. It is goofy but a fun movie...especially if you know the movies they are doing the take off from. It will make you laugh. A good escape!
1,Caveat Emptor,"This warning has nothing to do with Kandinsky's book but with this computer print-out edition. None of the vital information regarding the translator, his introduction, the publisher, copyright date or bibliographical notes on previous English editions, or International Standard Book Number is given. Neither are chapter graphics, illustrations or critical diagrams included. It is an unidentified text without provenance. In other words, it is useless for scholarly reference."
4,"Good,but very deep","I enjoyed reading the book. At times it was over my head,but still it was worth the effort!!!!"
4,Satisfied with this purchase,This came on time and in good condition. It is exactly as described and a good price. Mobile Edge products are well made. The carrying handles are as they look in the picture.
2,Only a wrist strap,"The case is good notebooks sleeve. However the strap is very small and can only be used around your wrist. The strap does not have any support, so when you carry the laptop with the strap, it swings all around. Also the material inside the case, which is there to protect the zipper from scratching the laptop, is very clumsy and is difficult to pull it around the laptop.Overall, if you want this case to use as a regular sleeve with a nice front zippered pocket, then this is for you. However, if you want to use this as a carrying case, it would be better to get something which has a SHOULDER strap."
2,No protection on the inside from the zipper,"This case seems like it would be great EXCEPT there is no protection on the inside from the zipper to prevent your computer from getting scratched. DUH!Also, the pocket on the outside is too small to fit anything other than maybe a couple cds (but no jewel cases).This is an example of a product with good materials and good intentions but seriously BAD design. They dropped the ball."
2,Not the One I expected,"This music video disappointed me. I liked it, but it was not the exact video I was looking for. I was looking for the Muppet version."
2,Inadequate at best,"I bought this dictionary rather rashly as it was the only one left on the shelf at my campus bookstore. Needless to say I will be returning it as soon as I get an opportunity. Smallness being the only meritorious feature, the very first entry I sought a definition for was, to my amazement, not there; and neither were the other two words I looked up after. I borrowed the HarperCollins Latin Concise Dictionary from the library and it too was rather disappointing though it contains 60,000 more entries than the Pocket OLD."
2,Sacrifices usefulness for portability,"This is, perhaps, not the worst pocket Latin dictionary one could buy, and I confess that I've not looked at them all. But I've yet to come across a worse one. The dictionary *is* portable--it does stress, after all, that it is a ""pocket"" dictionary--the layout is nicely done, and the price is low. However, the number of entries is very, very low, and I have found many of the definitions to be questionable. For the same price, my Bantam Latin-English dictionary--and the old one, not even the updated, expanded version--provides more entries and, in my opinion, more accurate definitions."
2,Good but insufficient to help you through the classics,"Its handy and useful for beggining basic latin. As a referrence to read the classics it is indeed, insufficient."
2,English-Latin Section Very Disapointing,"I choose this dictionary after taking a quick look at a copy of it in a bookstore, and having been pleased with its font and overall page layout. The pages weren't too busy, making easy to pick out each entry. That said, I should've taken a better look at the English to Latin section. I was very disappointed to see that for every noun in English there were given a few optional translations, but the dictionary did not break down each Latin example. No way to know what declension it was. It says which gender it each is but the only way to know its declension is to flip back over to the Latin section and look up the word under Latin. Only there will you see the conventional entry used for nouns in a Latin dictionary, i.e. flius, -, m, son.My advice: skip this and find another one, and look more carefully than I did at how the dictionary is organized."
3,Concise and portable...,"This is a fairly useful Latin Dictionary... I got it, because I thought it would be useful as a student of law and the classics. Though, perhaps its overarching merit is simply its portability. Usefulness and comprehensiveness are sacrificed to the utilitarian value of small size. Jurists (e.g. legal scholars) and Medical professionals might find it lacks too many key Latin terms relevant to their discipline."
2,bent HDMI Cable Connector,"I recently purchased the Belkin Silver HDMI cables (2) 4 ft. long ones--- the connector on one end of one of the cables was at an angle rather than straight on----- I used the one that was in good shape and went to Best Buy to replace the other. Bought a Monster cable that costs 3x as much but in this instance, I guess you really do get what you pay for. Sub-standard product. This is the second time this has happened on an amazon.com purchase, and it will most probably be the last. Z.V.J."
3,Customer Service,"I previously wrote a review for this item I received. I contact the seller via email with Amazon.com. They refunded my money without me having to ship the 3"" knife back. I really do not have any use for the mini knife but to open mail or maybe packages. I am only upgrading my rating to a 3 because they responded back to my email quickly. I do not recommend you purchase this knife useless you are looking for a 3"" blade small knife to put on your keychain."
3,ok,they were a little cheaper looking than i thought they would be from the picture. but they are good for the price.
1,Stay away!!!,"Cheap looking, bad quality, legs for 3 out of 4 chairs were broken within a year of use. Chairs are uncomfortable! Save your money for better chairs! BTW, table is the same bad quality."
1,did not work,"bought these to trick my dad with but received them threw mail opened an wouldnt work at all , was disappointed"
5,The highest point,"SOFAD along with Violator represent the peak of Depeche Modes creative output before the band nearly self destructed. While this CD may not have had the sheer number of singles as Violator, do yourself a favor and buy it! Walking in My Shoes and In Your Room are the two greatest songs in their catalog. This album was sadly the last with Alan Wilder as a member and the following CD's suffer for his loss. But while non DM fans might consider this one of the weaker efforts, just ask any true fan and they will assure you that this CD belongs at or near the top of the list."
5,Depeche Mode - Songs of Faith and Devotion,"A Fantastic album that YOU the music fan\lover\hater must have. This album have 10 fantastic and very well composed songs. A very diverse record that touches upon rock,gospel,soul,industrial,electronica,ambient,classical but sounds exactley like DM. There is Not a reason to Not check out this album. In my words this is the most Important Album of all time!!"
4,THIS DESERVES BETTER THAN ZERO PAL!,"Yes this album isn't VIOLATOR but still it manage to be very good. And yes, this is a quite heavy stuff here but still it's good. Here we have pearls like 'I Feel You', 'Walking in My Shoes', 'Condemnation', 'In Your Room' and 'Higher Love'."
4,this is progress,"This album is the cornerstone of an artist pushing themselves in a new direction. One thing you have to do with this album is listen to it loud! There are sounds you can't hear with the volume on low and it demands volume from the opening track. The bass kicks, and the moody vibe hooks you in. One thing you have to remember about DM is that they set moods, especially with this album."
4,GOOD JOB !!!!,"hi, i am a melomaniac from Peru, (yes, machu pichu)and i just wanna say that I love this album , it s not so electronic like the violator but it s beatiful, the best songs: judas,rush though ""I feel u"" is not one of their best songsI bought this album after hearing violator, i just wanted more of DM, and that was a right buy, if u love DM just buy it, u must know that this album has a diferent sound with respect to Violator, but It s a great album, please be opened mind"
5,Only,"This is the only Depeche Mode CD I own. I do like other songs of theirs, especially the new one Precious, but this is the only album that I like every single song."
2,Depeche on the decline,"Ok Ill admit it,for me Depeche Mode are and always will be a synth pop band. For them electric guitar/organic instruments simply don't work. And imo Depeche Mode realise this as they've proven with their latest return to their synth roots with Exciter. Ive given this 2 stars as it's still DM and has some pure electronica but I simply can't & will not tolerate electric guitars on their records..It's like when Neil Young went 'techno!?! Simply put if you want the REAL DM get everything pre & including Violator,ignore this & especially Ultra as they are travesties. Especially what I consider DMs peak,Construction Time Again & Some Great Reward,two unmitigated synth pop masterpieces. Peace!"
1,here is the least...,"...I know the audacity; shallow as it may seem - they lost me on the album cover. Previously the most intriguing thing about a Depech Mode album was it's cover. We began w/ what looked like a real duck in plastic wrap, and then there was the old woman chopping wheat.. the bride and groom underneeth the industrial landscape, and the red megaphone on Music for the Masses, and then the broken rose on Violater - Songs of Faith and Devotion is the only album before or since to have Depheche Mode on the cover lets not do that again..."
1,How to tell if you should buy this album,Buy this ONLY if one or more of the following apply:- You are really depressed- You have never liked (or listened to) any previous DM music- You think Ultra was good too and gave it more than one star- You like wasting money on albums that have only one good song- You like hearing scratchy voice and dull lyrics- You need it to complete your DM collection- You are afraid to admit DM should call it quits
4,A new direction,"Those who liked ""Music for the Masses"" and ""Violator"" might not want to buy this. It took me a month to get used to the new sound of DM. I like ""Walking in my shoes"", ""In your room"" and ""Higherlove"", but there is no comfort and complexity of ""Violator""."
4,GREAT,"this is one awsome cd! i really love dm's music all of it from the early 80's to now! and the more recent stuff like songs of faith.., or ultra have to be their most darkest, and basically the best they've done in their career! even with dave's drug problems in the early 90's they were still capable of making great music which shows you just what an incredable band they really are! long live DM."
2,Uninspired,"Depeche Mode in general and frontman Dave Gahan specifically when through something of an identity crisis with this release. Recorded in a time when 'Grunge Rock' was assualting the music world, 'Songs Of Faith and Devotion' marks Depeche Mode's departure from their romantic synthpop style (Violater, Black Celebration), and with its integration of real drums, heads towards a kind of 'Electro Rock' style. Aside from the beautiful single 'In Your Room', this release fails to capture the 'catchyness' and energy they became famous for. 'Faith And Devotion' is the sound of a band stumbling through a pop culture wasteland in an attempt to stay relevant, which is frustrating because Depeche Mode were big enough, had they stuck to their synthpop guns (their source of strength), to alter the music scene of the 90's."
5,ALL IN ALL NOT BAD-NOT THEIR BEST NOT THEIR WORST,"A REALLY GOOD ALBUM, MOVES IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN THEIR PREVIOUS MATERIAL, BEARING IN MIND THAT THAT WAS IN THE 80S, DEFINATELY LOOKING FOR A 90S SOUND, AND IT WORKS QUITE WELL. THE TOUR WAS ONE OF THE BEST THEY HAVE EVER DONE."
2,"Two awesome songs, lots not so great.","A Depeche Mode fan, I like the production on this disk. Strong vocals, lots of bass, less ""electronic"" feel. ""Walking in My Shoes"" and ""In Your Room"" are excellent songs. Unfortunately, the rest of the disk is completely unremarkable, and no where near the quality of ""Violator"" or ""Music for the Masses""."
5,A Masterpiece,"I am going to start off by saying that I am a supreme metal-head. I listen to TRUE metal. None of that Korn rubbish, but this album opened my eyes to music in general. I got it when i was about 6 years old on one Christmas. I annoyed the hell out of my parents for listening to it over and over. I wouldn't take it out of the cassette player. I know alot of people think that Depeche Mode is a bunch of Church-goers(which i have nothing against. I would never put down anyone just because they aren't the same religion i am), but my opinion of Depeche Mode is that they are THE supreme Goth band. Listen to the forboding, haunting atmosphere and think about it. My favorite songs are In Your Room, I Feel You, Walking In My Shoes, and the classical-tinged One Caress. Buy this album."
3,Partially prayed,"3 1/2Some phenomenal synth-pop in their production stride here, taking liberties with various genres to create hauntingly pretty, lasting impressions that contrast dance and melodic sides nicely, though throughout the album generic dark-wave tendencies creep into too much of the process, making SOFAD simply good with sides of brilliance, rather than reversed."
4,The next chapter of DM...,"This is a highly transitional album for DM. It has a more mainstream feel to it and has some very unique tracks to it such as the almost gospel sounding ""Condemnation"" and my ultimate favorite DM song ""One Caress"", which has Martin Gore singing against the background of an orchestra. Each track is a unique work and though the tone is a bit gloomy and the sound is different, it is still classic DM and a very good album."
3,Pretentious. Moi ?,"This cd has moody songs, fast songs, electronic songs, gospel songs, ambient songs, new philharmonic songs. It is no wonder that Alan Wilder (former DM and now Recoil) likes this album best: production-wise it is quite an achievement. But, as with the later Ultra, I am missing something. Maybe you can call it intimacy, maybe honesty, I don't know. Please note: SOFAD sure has highlights: 'In your room' is among the best songs by DM. 'Walking in my shoes' also is a great song. But on this album DM most of the time have lost their fine balance between naivity, honesty and clearity, and therefore is a disappointment. I feel the words and the music have to tell the story, not the style (Condemnation, ugh!). Not to mention the art work and cover-design, which is bad. Strange, by the way, that 'Ultra' suffered from the same lack of clearity, given the fact that Wilder (the production brain)left the band after this album."
3,Language not People,"This is a book tracing the relationships of Indo-European languages to a common ancestral root.Don't be fooled by a general synopsis or the headlining title into thinking it's about people as I had been. Although it does from time to time trace the history and origins of its speakers, the book most focuses on relationships between Latin, Tocharian, Irish, English and so forth. However, I still found it pretty worthwhile, because I do take an interest in language and culture.The book is a bit outdated by now, but has lots of good graphs and illustrations throughout. I was dissappointed, because I was looking for something more anthropological rather than linguistic or archeological. Therefore, it would be five, even though it's kind of old."
3,Endless Search for the Indo-Europeans,Great info but perhaps too many pages weighing the evidence for the exact geographic location of the original group ofpeople who spoke Proto-Indoeuropean. But an important basic text for understanding the issues of PIE.
4,An interesting attempt,"This is an interesting attempt to figure out exactly where the Indo-Europeans came from. The problemn is that we can't really know for sure. Still, the author's combonation of both linguistics and archaeology makes it a good readf for those interested in either subject."
3,"Not racist, just boring","The book takes a broad approach to an interesting but difficult subject. It started out strong, but became progressively less interesting. The discussion of language was very good, the discussion of homeland was reasonable, and the archeology section at the end was death. It's as if the author just ran out of excitement.To me, the book seems very uneven. As a layperson, I found the linguistic argument compelling, and the discussion of geography reasonably interesting, albeit a bit long. The discussion of archeological evidence is arcane and just not interesting to someone unfamiliar with the terminology and minutae of pre-historic European burial ritual.This book might not be the ideal introduction to this topic."
1,I wasn't convinced,The field of historical linguistics is in a state of crisis. The idea of a proto-Indo-European language is not supported by any of the currently complex systems models. This books speaks of an idea whose time has come and gone.
1,Full of flimsy arguments aimed to confuse the reader,"The author makes a very poor attempt of convincing the reader of his pre-conceived notions on the subject by using copius amounts of data and flimsy arguments and at the end he is himself confused about the whole thing. The author contradicts himeself all over the book and only a reader with a very short term memory might enjoy reading this piece of fiction. At many points his method of reasoning is hillarious. A serious reader should rather read the work of Leon Poliakov (""The Aryan Myth"") to get an insight into the racial politics involved with the issue, which has made an otherwise obvious fact, a topic of furious debates over more than a century. An excellent scientific analysis on the subject is presented in a recent book by Frawley, Kak et al ("" In the Cradle of Civilization"")."
1,Horrible.,"I bought this corkscrew thinking that it would be of good quality, as most of the other reviews said.however at work as i was opening a wine bottle and pulling the cork out the screw broke into two pieces.I had only used it about two times. Now i have to waste my time and return it.I have coworkers that have $5 corkscrews that have lasted longer than this piece of junk.Don't waste your time and almost $40 on this.It's seriously not as great as it looks."
3,nice but made in china,"I've always wanted a Laguiole corkscrew ever since I read about the brand's history. I pick up this corkscrew at extremely good price and was happy about it. Upon inspection of it, I found the made quality to be good and sturdy, but I could not find the ""made in france"" wording anywhere on the product. I then went to the garbage can and picked up the box and found it to be made in china. There is nothing wrong with product made in China but I will never expect a french brand that takes pride in producing in this local village to outsource to china."
3,Licensed product...,"This handles nice enough, though the foil cutter has a large seration to it that tends to mangle the foil. As a sommelier, presentation is hugely important. A little practice with it and I've learned to use it without ripping up the foil too bad. Its also a nice alternative that allows me to leave the more expensive gear at home.Its important to know that this is some sort of licensed product made by Trudeau and not nearly of the caliber of the Chteau Laguiole or Laguiole en Aubrac wares forged in Laguiole."
4,"Oh, the things our body and mind do to us","I found Nadiye to be open, sincere an thorough in her willingness to share her life experience. She presents her path, both trials and victories, to us in a way that we can start to understand what is happening within her. She thoughtfully recounts her experiences and the reactions of those around her. She tells us of the responses of both friends and professionals as she and they try to discover what is happening to her. Her well described experience helps us to understand others who have the same or similar difficulties. I would recommend the book to anyone who knows of someone suffering from psychological problems, no matter the cause"
3,Does NOT Work on OSX or Windows XP,"We have a Mac system that has OSX and a PC with Windows XP. We already owned this software, which we used on a Mac OS9 system (since sold). We bought the new copy, based on the incorrect advertising at the Amazon.com website.We like the software, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS XP OR MAC OSX!!!***** WARNING WILL ROBINSON *****"
5,Perfect,Beck Arnley i said it make the best products for your vehicle Beck and Arnley never fail installed perfectly and there was no leeks compared to Pentius it has nothing on Beck. this fuel filter was top notch works like a charm would recommend to everyone.
2,Great premise & cast but still missed the mark,Its a pity as this could of been a great war film but it just did not have the right stuff. Heston & Niven were good as was Ms. Gardner but the spirit was strong but it could not over come its problems.
2,"Fine Movie, Disappointing DVD","I won't comment on the movie except to say that I do like it and would agree with the other favorable comments here. I've seen it more than a few times and it always is an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the DVD release. The audio is adequate though it is only stereo. I didn't notice any particular problems with it. The video, on the other hand, is decidely inferior. It looks like it was transferred from a medium quality video tape. I have seen better looking presentations on broadcast TV. I had a tape recorded off the air that looked as good as this DVD. But the tape is gone and the DVD will at least last. The best thing that can be said about the DVD's video is that it is widescreen, but it is not anamorphic. Very disappointing. I hope some company will do a decent release of this in the not to distant future."
1,"Scratchy, lifeless knock-off","I don't know what DVD the other reviewers watched, but the one pictured with the banner ""Dolby Digital"" on top is a crime against cinema lovers. The 4.0 audio mix sounds like it is wandering away from the correct frequency transmission much of the time. There's a scratchy presence in much of the audio, and the actors' mouths are just a bit off, as if they are dubbed. The audio does a huge disservice to the Tiomkin score. I could not watch it very long, and I love this movie. In addition, the color looks washed out and the detailing is soft. Perhaps the master was taken from a satellite broadcast.The Korean subtitles are removable but the audio and image are unforgivable. Avoid this release and wait for its official release from a producer with the rights to the original elements."
1,Not Happy,I was not aware that this movie has Korean subtitles which is very annoying. It should have been more clear about this.
3,j b kuhl,"terrific service loved the movie but it came from china, as the original was not in chinnese!!. it also started differnt and the quality wasnt as good as the original"
3,Not Sure if this is What I Ordered,"I went back to check the sellers ad, but it was gone. I thought I was ordering a licensed copy of ""55 Days in Peking."" I was surprised to find Korean words on the box and Korean subtitles."
2,condition of the VHS tape,"I enjoyed the move, 55 Days at Peking, but the condition of the tape was less than ""very good"". There were sections throughout that were rough. I viewed it on two different VCRs and had the same result with both.The vendor did send the tape promptly.Again, I recommend the movie and hope it will someday be available on DVD."
4,Hard to find clasic movie DVDs.,The movie is a copy the disc looks different than a newly purchased one. Theese clasics should come in the A & B selection. Disc should be standard on one side and widescreed on the other. I would like to see moore titles soon. I will be looking for them.
1,Rating for Chinese version,"I am rating the quality of the Chinese version of DVD. The picture was so bad I never watched it. I just purchased the Korean/Japanese version, and would give it around 4 out 5. Picture was good, but the sound was a little tinny in spots.Will still keep an eye out for a North American release of movie. 5 out 5 for the movie itself"
2,Great Movie - Lousy Quality,"This DVD claims to be Dolby Digital. I think that this must be a false claim as the music sounds tinny and the quality of the sound in general is pretty poor. The movie itself is fabulous! However, don't buy this version unless you simply can't do without this tale of the Boxer Rebellion."
2,55 days in peking,WHEW!....What happened to this product? The sound was just TERRIBLE!HIGH & LOW....Recording equipment must be out dated.
2,55 DAYS AT PEKING,DID NOT REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A SUBTITLE ON THE DVD. NEED TO MAKE IT MORE AWARE IN THE AD
4,star-studded epic still as enjoyable as it ever was,"Just watched this movie again last night, and it never fails to grab me. 55 DAYS AT PEKING was arguably the best of the star-studded epics churned out by Bronston Studios in the 1960s. This historical adventure takes it's cue from the 55-day siege of Peking during the bloodthirsty Boxer Rebellion.Charlton Heston and David Niven lead the charge, with Ava Gardner on hand to lend the glamour as a penniless Russian baroness. The movie is also noteworthy for a sweeping Dimitri Tiomkin musical score, and the amazing paintings of Dong Kingman seen in the opening and closing credits. I'll be looking forward to seeing the film in a newly restored widescreen print as part of the Miriam Collection (like ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" and ""El Cid""). It can't come soon enough!"
4,Korean version worth buying,"I just purchased the Korean/Japanese version, and would give it around 4 out 5. Picture was good, but the sound was a little tinny in spots.Stay away from the Chinese version of DVD. The picture was so bad I never watched it.Will still keep an eye out for a North American release of movie. 5 out 5 for the movie itself"
4,"NICHOLAS RAY, OPUS 20","**** 1963. Directed by Nicholas Ray. Two nominations for the Oscars (Dimitri Tiomkin). AfterKing of Kings, this is the second Samuel Bronston production in a row for Nicholas Ray who, at the age of 52, delivers with 55 DAYS AT PEKING his last film. Peking, 1900. The empress's counselor persuades her to help the Boxers attack the 400 international soldiers trapped in a fortified compound in the middle of the city. The film is a great adventure movie but impossible to find here themes one could relate to the filmography of Nicholas Ray. No interesting bonus features but an above average copy here if you own a multi-zone DVD player. Recommended."
2,A waste of Kathleen Wilhoite,"There ARE some real gems to be found in the VHS Tape (i.e., never released on DVD) market, but not this movie. I bought it on the cheap as a used videotape because I like Kathleen Wilhoite. This talented character actress was wasted due to a nonsensical plot. I felt the screenplay must've been written over a weekend by a recent film school grad. Alas, Wilhoite has been relegated to either big roles in in terrible movies (e,g, ""Murphy's Law"") or too small roles in better films (e.g., ""Lorenzo's Oil"" and ""The Edge"").I wish Wilhoite would get a better agent before age diminishes opportunity (she's not yet 50)."
4,Humble beginnings,"This was R. Kelly's first album that came out towards the end of the New Jack Swing era ('88-'92). The first R. Kelly album I bought was his self titled album in '95 when he went solo. So I am sort of going backwards here. The only song I remembered was ""She's got that vibe"" from this album, but the rest of the songs sound very ""Teddy Riley & Guy"" sounding. By no means does this mean a bad thing-I am a huge fan of Guy too. It just means that R. Kelly's true talent & sound had not come into play yet. It's a good start to a performer that would really shine through the '90s and be a trend setter in the world of R&B music."
3,Its was great for what it is,"This is a pretty decent cd.Some people said it sounds old.This cd was good when it came out.You cant compare old to the present. The fast songs have the new jack swing style that teddy riley made famous with guy. He even raps in the break of some of the songs like many other singers used to do in that time. Shes got that vibe is the best fast song. His slow songs are why is like the album.His slow songs dedicated,slow dance,honey love, are still great now which make this still a good album."
4,The first of R. Kelly's works,"I really enjoyed it, songs like Honey Love, and Dedicate will stay with me forever."
3,Pretty Good,"not as tight as His Other Albums on a whole,but still has some moments.Dedicated,She's got that vibe,Slow Dancin,Honey love are the cuts. the rest of the Album was very inspired by Guy&Teddy Riley. very New Jack Swing sounding. this Album didn't forecast the Dominance that R.kelly would have over time."
1,who knew R.Kelly would recover,aside from Honey Love this was 2nd tier Guy Material.and the kind that is left for friends.nothing on this disc indicated the Impact that R.Kelly would have on the music Industry as a Writer&Producer.
4,I'm Loving Him,I forgot about this cd. This was when New Jack Swing was the top form of music and everyone wanted to be Aaron Hall and R.Kelly was no different (which isn't a bad thing). This album is full of beats that make you get on your feet and dance around the room. She's Loving Me is my favorite. This cd is good and if you love New Jack Swing this is for you. Next to forgetting this cd I also forgot how nice looking R.Kelly used to be. Damn I'm old
4,Pretty good product,"I have Crohn's disease and have a built-in sensitivity to dairy I didn't used to have. As long as I'm not eating half a pizza or having something with Alfredo sauce, one or two Say Yes to Dairy pills keeps me normal. This of course is when I am mostly in remission with occasional flare-ups. I don't have the really bad symptoms of Crohn's that some people have. My boyfriend has garden variety lactose intolerance, and they work for him, too, provided the dairy isn't too heavy."
4,better than Lactaid,I like this better than lactaid. I don't need as many pills so I guess its more effective. and they are easy to chew.
5,Great for golf clubs,My husband uses this to keep his clubs in good shape. He requested it for a present! //we gave this to 3 other people as well.
1,TERRIBLE!,This product is awful. It streaked and distorted the color of my stainless. Thankfully another product fixed it back! Worst money I ever spent!
4,A Shakespearean comedy from the mistress of mystery.,"A prince in disguise (or is he only a duke?) chats over the grave of his old joker friend. He receives a meaningful bouquet (there's rue for you). Midsummer Eve. Some clowns put on an entertainment and give away the plot. Young lovers pair off. The disguised duke (or prince) forges a letter concerning a murder. Villains foiled, end of story."
5,A great musical instrumernt,I can't understand a word of it. But; her voice is a musical instrument as wonderful to hear as charlie parkers horn or george shearing's piano. A perfect evening a glass of fine wine and listening to the above.
5,A solid winner! I couldn't put it down.,"This sequel fulfills the promise of the first novel in the series, PALACE, with nail-biting suspense, intrigue, treachery, and plot twists that kept me hooked througout. Mark Kreighbaum and co-creator Katharine Kerr have created some unforgettable characters in a complex and rich world. I hope we will see more of these characters, and more novels set in the isolated region of the galaxy known as The Pinch."
5,The Map moves ... Zhu-i ... and we flow.,"After waiting almost two years Mark Kreighbaum's book was finally available in Australia, much to my delight. What a blast! I finished it in one day, then went over my favourites bits to relish and adore the characters, structure and plot. Frankly, it was well worth the wait. Vida, Rico et al were very real. Mr Kreighbaum is on par with William Gibson. The story was alluring and exciting. His explanations of cyberspace and the Map mysteriously exciting, making me wish I had neural jackins and other glorious things that may free the mind and flow - The Map moves. It left me wanting more. I am, however, grateful that Mr Kreighbaum chose to explain the story in two books instead of a long drawn out saga which normally results in a frustrated reader. The book was spellbinding and enthralling. I cannot wait for his next one. Congratulations Mr Kreighbaum"
5,Intricate page turner with fantastic characters.,"""Eyes of God"" is a tightly woven, electrifying book that goes beyond the usual SciFi offerings. The author creates multi-dimensional characters navigating in intricate & harrowing situations. He has crafted societies with past/present/future dimensions which are not only entertaining forays into meta-thought, but challenging mental puzzles. One must have one's wits about them to absorb all this author has to offer. ""Palace"" was excellent, but this is even better."
3,BEEN THERE DONE THAT,"IT WAS ONE OF THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY IS THE COMMERICIAL ON THE CD LOL.ALL THEY DID IS PUT SOME SONGS TOGETHER FROM OTHER ALBUM.GOT THEM THOUGH BUT ITS STILL THE BEST.ONE OF THE BEST,DIFFERNT CATEGORY FROM VANILLA ICE.PEACE"
1,Giselle Peep Toe Pump,"Unfortunately, my review for these is not good. The shoe sizes are way off. I ordered my size which is 10 and they were more like an 8 when I tried to put them. They are very small shoes and that was extremely disappointing to me."
4,THE textbook for ASE certification!,"If you want to obtain ASE certification, you want this book. If autobody work is your hobby, you want this book. Covers auto-body work, from tools to procedures, as any such book should. But it also covers areas that most others don't. Shop layouts, safety equipment and uses, (What fire extenguisher to use on what type of fire.) hand tools and techniques for use, types of sheet metal, air compressors, how to set-up air supply lines, types of welders, and more. From small repairs to painting, and diagnosing paint problems. Each chapter starts with objectives of what you should learn, and is followed by questions (multi choice, essay, math) to test what you learned. Followed by appendices for shop terms & abbreviations, decimal & metric equivalents, fluid and air nozzle selection charts, viscosity conversion charts. If you want to work on cars, professionally or as a hobby, YOU NEED THIS BOOK!!"
3,not bad,even though its out of date it gives you a good starting point with safety and the tools needed to do the work and but some of the safety stuff its a little out of date
5,Wilder and Sutherland made a great combination,"A very funny poke at the French Revolution. Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland are two sets of twins mismatched at birth and play the dual roles of pampered aristocrats and poor country bumpkins. A little slap-stickish, but very entertaining."
4,Start The Revolution Without Me,"Enjoyable movie from 1969 about a mixup with two sets of twins, one from a nobel family and one from a peasant family. That their paths intermix during the revolution only adds humor to the situation, as one group is mistaken for another. Humor."
5,Excellent!,"I first saw this movie when I was a senior in high school. A friend of mine took me and was repeating all the important lines just in case I didn't catch the puns. Well today I practically have memorised the film after repeated viewings ( how many times?)and now my daughters, one aged 13 the other 7, have picked up on this zany, non-stop spoof on an Engilsh version of French history. Who can forget the Corsican brothers, Mimi Montage or the Count d'Escargot. Let's not forget the compulsively self involved Phillipe deSisi and his pet stuffed eagle, Thor. This film has rightly attained cult status."
2,"Overdone Cliches, Not Truly Funny","This sounded like a great film. I love Gene Wilder and I am all for a film that will give the French Revolution a little levity. Humor can be a very memorable instructor. This film used cliches of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI that were so incredibly overdone that they were silly, corny, and dull. Those were not the only characters to suffer from that treatment. There were also silly sexual innuendos, including some of S&M.;The sad thing is that the plotline was great. It took a poor director, or direction, to pull off the whole thing so badly. It belongs to that class of films that are wannabes. It wannabe funny, entertaining, and clever. Instead it became dull and silly. The ending was supposed to be slapstick and ended up slapstuck instead. A shame really."
1,Bombs away,"This is one for the golden turkey book. It bombed with critics when it first appeared because it is NOT funny. Each scene is simply embarrassing. If college kids treat it reverently these days, my guess is that they're smoking the same stuff as the cast of this film must have been enjoying. And I purchased this because of the viewers' comments! This bears no resemblance to the later films of Gene Wilder (except the dreadful Silver Streak). It's also a waste of Donald Sutherland. And to think that Norman Lear lent his name to something this awful."
3,photo-lite,"I have owned this camera for more than 7 years. After the warranty expired the auto wind went. The cost of repair was more than a new camera, so I have manually rewound the film - with mixed results. I replaced it with a Minolta."
3,"OK, but nothing special","I've had this camera for a couple of years and have used it for family events, etc. When some friends and I went to Yosemite, I noticed that their point-and-click cameras got better results. It's a fine camera, but you can't zoom in or out at all. It only has two settings: either for mountains or for up close. Also, I've accidentally dropped it a couple of times and the batteries, film, everything has shot out of it. It didn't break, but it's not super durable either. Anyway, it's fine, but next time I'm going to spend a little more money for one with more features."
3,Shannon Larkin DVD,"""Behind the Player: Shannon Larkin"" DVD is excellent. Mr Larkin has influenced my drumming for years and this video is awesome. The player in my laptop pc will not play it - the first DVD I've not been able to play here. However, it plays ok in conventional DVD players."
2,"A Mixed, Messy Bag","Started my Big Books love with Urban Legends, which is fantastic both as a record of twice told tales and a great gallery of comic book artists, then bought Unexplained, which I like even more. I bought Conspiracies hoping to hit the trifecta...and was actually really disappointed.I'm not sure exactly what goes so wrong, but for starters, the book fails to cover the basics. It immediately jumps past the obvious stories of, say, the JFK and MLK assassinations to get into the minutiae, whereas a nice primer would help get why the post-death mysterious killings and events are so mysterious. Each chapter, if it can be called that, tends to run on way too long, and rambles a lot. And though it feels like there should be no shortage of material, you almost start >yawn< getting tired of the same conspiracies examined at a different angle."
1,Big Book of GARBAGE.,"Full of Lies, Misstatements and Exagerations, all labeled TRUE.Save your money- if you want this sort of thing just search the web for free. Start with David Ickie, and if he doesn't put you off, you're hooked. God help your soul."
5,About to buy my 3rd copy,"Ten years ago, I used to intern at a PR firm that shared floors with Oliver Stone's production company in Santa Monica. I didn't even need to bring in my Big Book of Conspiracies--I merely mentioned it to the receptionist (who sat at the desk from Wall Street), who told me, ""Yeah, we all know about that book over here.""That copy I lost, and its replacement was loaned and never returned. Hence, copy #3. It's such an entertaining read, and just enough to get you itching to rummage for more conspiracy factoids on your own."
3,"Good, but not great for a Big Book.","I've read all of the Big Book series, but I don't own them all. After getting my own copy of this one, I'm a bit disappointed.My biggest problem is that they treat the material with too much credibility. This was also a problem with the Big Book of the Unexplained, where they treated absurd speculation with such respect that it reduces the respectability of the book."
4,Have you looked over your shoulder lately?,"The latest in ""The Big Book of"" series is a brief but comprehensiveoverview of the big conspiracies - from JFK/MLK/RFK to UFOs toto more the more modern Whitewater and Casolaro cases. Are theyall related? You be the judge. Even as a conspiracy layperson, Icould see the stories stretch the facts a bit to make a point (or isthat what the Illuminati want me to think?) The number of peoplemurdered/suicided in this book is enough to make one think twiceabout nosing around. Makes you think if someone may be monitoringyour trail around the net. The graphics are great, the web tangled,and now I find myself keywording CIA and UFO on Amazon."
3,slightly successful,"It was an interesting idea to remix some of these Blue Note jazz classics, I suppose with the intention of giving them a more modern and ""hip"" vibe for the younger generation. I have nothing against re-makes and re-working older tunes, but in this case I think too many of the experiments either fall flat or just don't come close to the magic of the originals. Some of these remixed versions are pretty cool and others are a bit annoying. Kudos to the producers for at least trying something different, but I don't think most older Blue Note fans will not be too crazy about this compilation."
2,the cd art was pretty to look at...,"...much props to the guys and gals and the photo session!buti was seriously disappointed in this project... maybe my expectations were too high considering the title of 'BLUE NOTE REVISTED!!!!' ... however, i remain optimistic that they'll come thru for me with the next chapter in this series (you just KNOW there's gonbe one!)peace."
4,Ecsape mental patients..what could be better?,"Michael Keaton, Peter Boyle, Christopher Loyd, and Stephen Furst - great cast. My parents always loved this movie so I bought for them to enjoy."
5,The Dream Team,"A funny, sweet, sad and totally entertaining movie for the family. Michael Keaton at his best."
3,Univeral Studios DVD's do not have closed captions,"I was very unhappy to discover that all Universal Studios DVDs do not have real closed captions for the deaf and hard of hearing, even though they say they have it in their product description and on the DVD box. What they really have is english subtitles with a few sounds identified. The subtitles are large, block the screen and jump all over the place. Worst of all, they do not identify who is speaking, making me have to guess who is saying what.I am a big fan of Micheal Keaton, but Universal's deceptive marketing destroyed this film for me."
5,Awesome movie,This is an awesome movie full of great writing and acting. It was truly funny and is a lost gem. Highly recommend it.
5,The Dream Team: A great movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. I laughed so much at the zany guys and their actions. I would love to see more movies like this one.Everyone should watch ""The Dream Team"""
3,The Dreamy Teamy,"Ok, well, at least one of them WAS dreamy. This all-star comedy is such fun but not as much as many others of it's kind. Keaton and company are institutionalized and have been for sometime, in some of their cases for more than ten years. Their doctor believes they are on the speedy road to recovery and need an outing for the first time ever. A Yankees game is just the ticket! RrIiGgHhTt! Ok, approved and all they head to the big event only to be met by more errors than found on a Tandy 86. They end up separated from their doctor, who they learn is in mortal danger, and must pull together against their mental illness, all odds and pull together to save themselves as well as their doctor. It is a cute, sweet and warming film that respectfully meets the topic of mental illness without being excessive in portraying it."
4,"Not Classic Disney, but good fun.","After the success of such Storybook tales like Snow White, Pinocchio, and Bambi, the studio took a different turn and presented about nine films that were more like many Fantasias than epic fairytales. This is one of the best and it truely is a standout among the Disney films. Donald Duck hosts the show, and he meets along the way Hose' and Panchito. The film is musical and colorful. It may not be one of the greats but definately good."
2,Watched Rarely,"We rank this 30 out of 41 Disney animated movies that we own. It is watched rarely. This old disney classic features some of our favorite characters in a fairly entertaining, fun chartoon musical. But time has pushed this movie down the rankings in popularity by the fact that my family likes 29 other Disney cartoon movie better than this one.Still, if you come across it at a thrift shop or garage sale, check it out, becuase it is wholesome G rated family entertainment before hollywood started making PG13 and worse movies calling them family entertainment."
1,Terrible sound and crammed format.,"This is unquestionable my favorite Walt Disney title; colorful, exuberant, and orchestration not captured again until Beauty and the Beast - after having left RKO. The problem: crammed video format and terrible sound quality of Amazon RUINS all this films' qualities. This was my first, and perhaps only, Amazon video purchase - I'm soooo disappointed!"
1,The Three Caballeros,i was dissatisfied with this cartoon when i received it in the mail it said it was a disney cartoon in the package what i received was a copy in black and white not like the real one with all the nice colors
5,Los Tres Caballeros,Loved it. Made a mistake buying it twice thinking they were different because of the cover. Next time I will be more careful
2,It was not as good as I remember it.,"I remember seeing this as a kid and it was a lot better. It starts out okay, but then it just gets weirder and weirder."
2,"Love the movie, hate the DVD!","This was one of my favorites as a kid. I was really disappointed with this DVD. You can see the film grains, especially in the live action/animated scenes. Also, I don't remember the film entirely, but it seems like they left ALOT of stuff out that was in the original movie. Its weird that they would NOT take the time to perform a restoration of some sort when transferring from VHS to DVD."
3,Just very average,disney movie shows a lot of imagination but seems to lack a theme to tie ideas together. It ended so abruptly I thought there should be something more.
2,Maybe I Missed Something,"Ok, maybe I missed something in this movie, but it wasn't that great for me. There were a couple of cute segments and I liked The Three Caballeros song. Otherwise, this was definitely not one of Disney's best. As a whole, the movie was boring and Donald's girl chasing was somewhat irritating. This movie has gotten such great reviews that I'm thinking there was something I missed and I need to watch it again. If you're watching it for the first time, don't expect too much. There wasn't much of a plot line, just badly tied together segments about Latin America. Again, not one of Disney's best."
2,not one of the better Disney animated features,"sexist, stereotypical nonsense involving three cartoon birds has some interesting animation but not much to raise it above the boring levels it maintains for most of the film."
5,"Not Disney's best, but one of my fav's.....","Intro: Okay so I've loved this movie since I was about 6yrs, and when I was 6yrs I didn't know anything about drugs or what-not. Or think much of how much Donald chases girls, not even when I watched it again at 8yrs and then 11yrs. But now that I'm 17yrs I still love this movie I watched it 3x's in two days. Due in part to my nephew who now loves the movie. Anyways it may not be Disney's best, but I think its worth a watch what with its great song and dance scenes or just songs... Its certainly an interesting trip. Part travelogue, part acid trip,and mostly all fun. Kids will love it, I still love it and I'm 17yrs. Certainly not for everyone, but all fun none-the-less. One of my favorite Disney films still of course nothing can beat Cinderella...ahahaha Anyways *enjoy*!!!"
4,A Very Strange Movie,This movie plays out like some sort of acid trip. The animation is not up to par with some of Disney's earlier movies but it is still worth checking out. Lots of beautiful Latin women too.
4,"For animation fans, a classic...","As cohesive films go, this isn't at the top of the list. As the Amazon reviewer commented, Donald doesn't do much more in this movie but run around after Latin beauties. But Disney cut the animators loose otherwise, and the result is eye-poppingly energetic. Mary Blair, Ward Kimball, and the rest created one of the first visually anarchic animated movies, breaking every rule. For animation fans, the title song and ""You Belong To My Heart"" are not to be missed."
4,Latin Music Fun!,"The insight into the two latin cultures of Brazil and Mexico are informative and entertaining. The Brazilian and Mexican style of music and dance is educational and a smart way of introducing children into the history behind these two latin cultures. Although the styles of dress are dated, the songs are fun to sing along to, especailly Panchito with his Mexican spirit, engery, and style. The three caballeros dancing and singing their way through this movie reflect a comradary among the two American continents that exists today. Mr. Disney was truly ahead of his time when he created this cartoon in the forties."
5,Amazing,"Ok i have seen Disney Movies in the 1990's, but when they showed this movie in my spanish class i fell in love with it. I i was so happy too buy the DVD. My family and i laugh. The songs, Music,a nd the acting are awesome. Disney was ahead of his time. The colros really caputre my atteation. My younger cousins who are 3,6, and 10 really loved the movie and i have learn from this movie. If you love old disney movies then i think this the perfect on for your collection."
1,Trying to be what it is not,"I typically like House Beautiful books, but not this time. If you are looking for an instruction manual on paint techniques, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for distinctive photographs showing paint techniques, you will be disappointed. Even if you are looking for a coffee table book of beautiful photos, which is what the editors of House Beautiful are best at publishing, this book disappoints. About all this book is good for is a paper weight, and even then the hefty 1000 Practical Ideas for Home Decorating is a better choice.Recommendation: skip it."
2,not so great,A picture book. Would have been interested to know exact names of paint colors used and more on painting technique for rooms using trompe l'oeil or geometric designs.
1,"poor quality,ran small","from the picture this boot looks wonderful, sturdy, and great looking. in reality, it was poorly made, ran small and was uncomfortable. I returned it same day."
2,looked like plastic,These boots were cute in the photo but when they arrived looked like they were made of plastic-obviously fake leather (which they were!). I ended up returning them and had to pay for shipping them back. They just looked too fake.
4,Great Buy,"Many months ago I bought a pair on sale. They were extremely light and comfy, and matched with just about everything. The only down side to these is the quality of the zipper tends to break easily. Thus what happened to me. :( Though that happened, I'm planning to buy another pair. Totally a great buy and worth every penny."
1,Look great in the pic but...,"I bought these cause they looked so awesome in the picture and they had a great price. The shipping was quick I got them really fast. I was so disappointed when I opened the box, they looked so cheap. I've worn dr martens since I was about 12, I knew these boots weren't going to be the same quality but I just did not like them I sent then back and I'm still waiting on a refund."
4,Awesome boots...,"I give these 4 stars and not 5 because the calf strap needed to have an extra hole punched to fit properly. However, these boots are great otherwise. They fit exceptionally well. I wear a size 6.5 and find these to be incredibly true to size. I also find them to have a very large calf circumference. I wear a designer petite size 4, but have snowboarder's calves. They measure 15"" ! Finding boots that fit well in both the foot & calf are always a challenge because of this. I would highly recommend these to anyone with a similar problem. Take the chance and actually buy them in your size. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. If you have a calf larger than 15"", I would highly recommend the Nana Pole Climber boots. They also fit larger calves and run incredibly true to size. Hope this helps someone out there with muscular legs!"
5,Cool Boots!,"Love these boots. They fit true to size, I am an 8 and that is what I ordered and they fit great; even on my wide flat feet :-). The other cool thing is you can adjust the laces to accomodate calves. My calves are 15 1/2"" and I had no problems. Very fun addition to my winter shoe collection. Worked great over my skinny jeans too!Seller is awesome, great customer service. Very pleased with my purchase."
4,Boots run SMALL,"These are great...not leather but they seem to be very well made. HOWEVER, I ordered a size 10 because that usually gives me lots of extra room for thick socks for the wintertime, but even without socks, my big toe pushes into the end without even standing up. I would say this ""10"" is more like a 9...maybe a small 9-1/2. So order a size too big when you order. Otherwise, they are great."
3,meh,If you don't pay a lot for them they are cool.Like if you get the on sale for $20.They just aren't worth a lot.Low quality.fake leather marks easy.Then cracked.Eyelets pop out.One popped out after 1 wear.Zipper broken after a few months.
4,I love them,"They aren't the BEST quality but I think they are going to hold up just fine.... I bought them for halloween but have worn them several times since...(Have them on right now) I did put a cushion in the bottom (they don't have alot of support in the sole, but thats a cheap and easy fix) They look really cute, I get lots of compliments! I think they will be great this winter when its snowy and wet! And before I bought these I was reading the other reviews... They kept saying that the size was different then what they usually wore.... I wear 7 in most all my shoes and thats what I ordered and they fit perfectly"
4,Decent boots for the money,I purchased these boots for my teenage daughter and she really likes them. We tried similar boots on in a store and the zipper broke while she was walking around in them. She has worn these boots around a month and the only problem is a little scratch in the toe that isn't noticable. All in all a good purchase.
4,Decent for skinny legs!,"I have some of the skinniest ankles and calves so look for lace-up boots that I can tighten. These tighten very nicely in the calf area, but I wish they could be tightened a tad bit more in the ankle area. Still, they look good, I just had to cut the laces as they are extremely long if you tighten them a lot. The boots look similar to leather, the material is pretty thick. I would have ordered a 7 if they were real leather as leather stretches out, but I got a 7.5 instead and they fit well. The toe bed is a bit wider than I like, but not too too wide. The tread on the soles, I expect to be good when it gets icy out. I think these are a great bargain!"
2,Quali-not!,Had these boots for about 11 months. Things started scuffing or falling off with in the first 6 or so. The zipper. OH the woe's of zippers. I can no longer wear them because the zipper is broken already. They are really adorable but far to expensive for something that should have come out of a vending machine.
3,Not what I was hoping for,The boots are not what I expected. The material is a lot thinner than I would have thought. Not happy with the way the boots are put together. I bought these for motorcycle riding and I do not expect them to last very long. However for the price it is not worth the effort to return them and I will get what use I can out of them until I find a better pair of boots.
5,Very nice!,"The boot is exactly how it's displayed. It's comfortable, yet stylish. And the price is fair. I definitely recommend it."
4,Fabulous!,"Super cute and super comfortable right out of the box. I'm amazed with these! Most knee high boots are too big at the top for me but these fit perfectly and are easily adjustable so they conform to your shape. Shipping was prompt, quality is great.The one and only drawback is that I'll probably have to get insoles for them because the padding on the bottom wears out after a few hours. Otherwise, a FAB pair of boots. I may order a few more pairs of these. ;)"
5,A menagerie of fun,"From a cat whose haughty opinion counts to a pig that won't eat, these are some wonderful stories. I laughed out loud at quite a few of them and of course the fact that the characters of Jeeves and Wooster make an appearance is simply an added bonus. It made me want to pick up more of Wodehouse's works!"
5,Good complilation of PGW stories...,"This is book was my first introduction to PGW. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the stories. His writing style is flawless, which makes his stories jump right off of the page. It's a shame more people aren't familiar with his FUNNY and highly enjoyable body of work. A must have for any zoophile and Wodehouse reader."
5,G. Rap in his prime (it's like watching a gangster film),"After dropping two gems on hip hop, Kool G. Rap & D.J. Polo returned in 92 with the AMAZING third album. G. Rap was still in his prime with Live And Let Die, an album SO gangster it's beautiful. Ever wonder why Kool G. Rap was always looked at as one of the greatest MCs of all time, this album shows why. Here's the review:Album Highlights: NO FILLER, this is ONE gangster film, every song from the intro to the final song is worth a listen.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up, if you LOVE storytelling raps, this album is for you.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: While truly better than Road To The Riches, but CHALLENGED by Wanted Dead Or Alive, this may or may be the BEST Kool G. Rap album EVER. He represented here with the gangster storytelling. He might not have made an impact in record sales, but he's still on of the greats, as he proves on this album. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION. Don't sleep on this album."
5,WHAT A FANTASTIC VOICE,"I first heard of John in the 60ies while I was living up in LA. My friends and I were driving around Vegas then, trying to get in to see Elvis, but of course it was sold out. The radio was playing Cheryl Moana Marie and we I thought of getting to see John, but of course it was also sold out. I love his voice and have 3 LP's that friends of mine picked up for me in New Zealand and we just about wore out the vinyl playing him over and over again. This set of CDs is FANTASTIC.... I will enjoy them tremendously..... thank you, Millie"
3,I've down graded my review,"This book does teach you to create reusable components. It misses out on the implementation of Business Logic and searching. The further you get along in the book the more you realize you're not really getting the answer to ""How do I make a real application now?"" It's very frustrating. I am using these principles and objects in a large scale web app and will report back here in a month or two when it's done whether or not I need a new job... :)"
1,Where is an editor when you need one?,"There is so much muck covering the gems that the proposed architecture never becomes clear. Too much, ""Okay, now I'm going to tell you..."" ""Next chapter I'm going to tell you..."" If this book had a good rewritting and an editor, it could have been a worthwhile effort. Also, the focus is split between how to set the physical architecture (how many computers, etc) and how to write general purpose business objects that in theory could be used by many unrelated departments, and split again into how what essentially is making objects suitable for automatic code generation. This book needs to be split into maybe three refocused books, and needs a chainsaw to chop out the wordiness."
3,"Inspired, incomplete, imperfect","Even as a non-VB programmer I got some great ideas from this book, such as the implicit pattern for implementing auditable entities and dynamic property lists in SQL Server. The (perhaps too long) introductory material on ""farms"" (distribution and components) had me yelling ""Yes!"" out loud. But, I found the organization of the book befuddling at times, and thought some of the methods and advice weren't as universal as they sounded. Look at this as one man's well-refined method for delivering a broad, but not universal, class of applications on the VB/MTS/ASP/SQL Server platform. Was worth my time. Thanks Mr. Moniz!"
5,Haunting and Beautiful,"Can a child exist that never really was? After reading this book you'll wonder if it is indeed possible. ""Pearl"" is a baby that was taken from one mother by another and then returned. The journey these three women take is all based on a lie that each must weave into their own lives. Sometimes fate can be cruel and loving at the same time. Take a chance and try to find this gem, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Wow!,"Boyfriend loves this as a gift. It is sure to provide hours/months/years of enjoyment whilst completing it! Great, fun gift."
1,bad customer service,Upon putting the panels together we realized we had been sent a duplicate piece and we were missing one of the panels. I contacted customer service for the company that makes the product and was told I could purchase an entire new set of panels for $10.00 and $4.95 s&h. As the mistake was clearly on the part of the company I was certainly not willing to pay another $15 to get the complete puzzle.
5,Great for crossword puzzle fiends,"You may have to move the entertainment center out of the living room to make room for this on your wall, but it'll be well worth it. This crossword puzzle is a good combination of easy, difficult, and impossible clues, so the whole family (or the whole office) can participate. I'd suggest a crossword dictionary for the harder clues. This is loads of fun! It's the best crossword puzzle I've ever worked on - when does the next one come out?"
2,You'll play it once,"The amazon marketplace tells you all you need to know about the Connie and Carla soundtrack: a recent release, yet the ""58 used and new from $2.46"" notice as of this writing demonstrates a clear lack of value. The entire soundtrack clocks in at a jawdroppingly shallow 27 minutes 52 seconds.I think my experience with resonate with other buyers: I played the soundtrack once, trying to capture a bit of the spark from an enjoyable *little* movie. But what you find is that any verve came from a combination of the songs with the video. Best example: the 'Evita' moment - a spirited rendition of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" - is rendered flat and affectless on CD. Not seeing the audience jump up on cue, Madonna-like, in classic Evita pose succeeds in draining the fun out of the track. What you're left with is dinner show-quality takes of well-worn Broadway tunes...and, not even the whole tunes, just what amounts to a 28 minute medley with some useless interspersed dialogue."
2,See The Movie - Ponder The Soundtrack,"""Connie and Carla"" is one heck of a funny movie and the music skits are hilarious! These two women actually can harmonize and its fun to watch (and hear) them. However, when listening without the film, the songs sound flat. There's energy there, but without the visuals, nothing really happens. This just becomes a novelty album that you can describe to your friends, but they won't get it unless they see the film. So. Go see the film."
3,Fun Soundtrack,"This is an accurate soundtrack from the movie. It even includes Debbie Reynold's second verse of ""There are Worse things"" that was cut from the movie. It would've been nice to hear the cast sing full versions of the songs instead of the 20 second medley pieces, though."
2,this item is NOT A POTHOLDER!!!!,"This is listed as a pot holder and described as a mitt... it is neither. it's a teeny-tiny sleeve that slides over the handle of your saucepan!!!! very deceiving description and not at ALL what i thought i had ordered. but for the price, it's not even worth returning so i kept it and just use it as it's supposed to be used.but if you're looking for a REAL potholder, check out the le creuset MIT!"
5,Mike Taylor is a very good instructor,"This video gives you step by step instructions on the basics of playing bluegrass banjo. Mr. Taylor goes over learning how to reading tablature, shows you several right hand roll patterns, left hand techniques like slides, hammer-ons and pull-offs, etc.There are several popular banjo songs like John Hardy, Cripple Creek, Old Joe Clark, etc that will be learned on from the tape. You will see and hear how each song is played in three steps: Fast, slow and thorough on each measure of the songs, then playing again, but slower.Mr. Taylor seemed like a warm, down home person. He is easy to learn from. He is great in explaining about requirements of time, focus and patience in learning to play banjo. Moreover, he has a great smile."
3,Has it's moments,"If you liked the first Scooby Doo, then most likely you will enjoy the second one. The CGI effects of Scooby Doo are much cleaner this time around. The entire cast is back with the addition of Seth Green and Alicia Silverstone. It's pointless to describe the plot, but it's just as goofy and silly as the first one. It's perfect for kids with just the right amount of adult humor that will go right over the kids head. It's a little too busy and about halfway through the movie, I got a little bored cuz it seems like every 5 minutes Scooby and Shaggy were getting into some type of trouble where they had to run from the Ghosts, but there are 2 very funny scenes where Scooby and Shaggy drink a potion that changes them into different monsters, and a Dance sequence with Scooby in an afro. I wouldn't recomend buying Scooby Doo, but it makes for a good rental."
4,more Scooby Doo!,"I'm happy to see reviewers with more positive opinions on the Scooby Doo sequel. However, I really don't see how this is supposed to be a great big leap in terms of quality over the original. The first one was very good, this one is just an improvement.The entire gang is back for another mysterious adventure! This one has more action over the original, which is certainly a good thing because you can NEVER have too much action. I agree that the story this time around is told better. Simply put, it's more interesting. That doesn't mean the story in the other movie is worthless- please remember that.Fans of Scooby Doo won't be disappointed by this movie. This time, they REALLY take advantage of the special effects that began in the previous movie. The ending has a series of interesting events happen, and there's even a few scenes that were borderline horror flick.Great movie. I still believe these are some of the best family movies available."
2,Dull,"Doo 2 has it's good parts, but it also has a lot of bad parts. The movie is pretty boring without any funny bits. The fun is potty humor, which to adults isnt funny. The special effects are great, but they dont make a good movie, substance does, and this movie doesnt have that. If you have kids,it'll be ok. For fans of the cartoon, stay away."
3,Fun but getting old way too quickly.,"The first Scooby-Doo was a decent live action film that incorporate a slick sense of fun, and manages to keep things in perceptive insight of the fact that it was still based on a classic cartoon. This movie does keep things light on its feet but lacks the POW that made the first film a much better experience. The original Cast is back which includes Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mattew Lillard, and Freddie Prinze Jr, but the chemistry is gone, and the wow factor is gone as well. The movie tries to incorporate a lot of the bad guys from the earlier cartoons but it does not handle it successfully, and becomes sensory overload after the first twenty minutes of the film. I give some respect to those who tries to bring a sense of fun to story but its about time they shook up the formula before it gets tired, and its getting tired rather quickly."
5,Zoinks! this is good,I love this movie as much as the first. Many people didnt like it but many did.this movie seems like the old tv show in some respects and differnt in others.i would really recommend this to any scooby fan. Scooby Dooby Doo!
4,lovin scooby,my 1 year old is totally in love with scooby doo so she loves this movie and the first one.
3,Scooby Doo,Scooby Doo is cool. I like charachters in this movie. FUN MOVIE!!!!! ( VELMA IS OVERWEIGHT!!!!! FRED HAS BIG BUTTT)
1,Total garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is just as bad as the first.. the charachters are very, very, very inapropiate. Not fun to watch."
1,Don't waste your money....,"Ohhh puh-lease.... This movie was not so funny. movie to inapropiate for youngsters around the age of 5-7.. The cover lies. My family didn't like it. Wathch Scooby-Doo on TV but don't waste your money on this annoying, pythetic peice of trash. In staed of tears of laughter, it will leave you and your familiy with tears of miseary...."
4,Pure Fun,"This movie was really cool. It was better than the first one. I think that if you go to see it and you are thinking that this movie is going to be really good then you might not like it that much. If you are going to watch this movie and you think that this movie will be silly, and maybe a little bit stupid fun then you will like this movie better."
5,Grandmother of Ryan (7) & Kevin (5) review,"I'm a grandmother and I watched this film with my grandsons. We all laughed and laughed. This movie is so much better than the previous one, this movie is geared toward kids, where Scooby Doo is the STAR and Shaggy is the 2nd Star. The rest of the cast are more in the background. The monsters were so much better, especially the skeletons; the Scooby tricks were great, and any movie that has ""a farting Scoobie"" is an instant HIT with boys !!!!My 5yr old, Kevin's review ""Mom-Mom, when Scoobie (2) is out of the movies, I'm going to get it (DVD) and bring it over to your house so we can watch it again!"". My 7yr old (Ryan) eyes were glued to the screen and he chuckled and laughed all the way through, and this 59yr old grandmother was laughing right along with everyone else in the theater. Great Kids Movie (and for those of us still kids at heart)."
3,Scooby-Doo 2,"When real monsters start coming to life and terrorizing Coolsville, the Scooby gang must come to the rescue and stop the madman behind the scheme. The mastermind behind this terror is also tarnishing the gang's image as well, making them doubt themselves. All of this in a movie that probably did not need to be made, but was inevitable after the success of the original. The whole cast returns for this sequel, but this series is starting to feel tired already. True, younger audiences will probably enjoy it, but unless adults are big Scooby-Doo fans, there will be some disappointment. If you want to see it, wait for DVD."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST: THE NOVELTY HAS WORN OFF,"In this second installment of a live action SCOOBY DOO, the novelty of bringing the gang to real life has worn off. I was wowwed by the first movie because of the casting. Who knew Velma was hot? How did Matthew Lillard get his voice to sound that way? Scooby was incredible. This outing, they have to get to work, so the producers brought many of the old villians to life here with positive results(...)."
3,Could have been so much better!,"Even though I've been a major Scooby Doo fan for as long as I can remember, I am going to have to say that I am in complete agreement with the previous reviewers in giving this movie 3 stars. The film is about average in relation to the amount of entertainment it provides and most of the jokes fall flat. The plot is not all that bad, but the actors seem forced in portraying their roles/characters. Nevertheless, the special effects are very good.In all honesty, I'll take the cartoons anytime compared to the two movies, though if you're a Scooby fan you might want to give it try, but keep in mind it's no masterpiece."
1,dvd stops 5 minutes in,"This DVD stops 5 minutes in and then starts skipping and jumping, was marked as good or very good condition. I expect good to be able to at least play the movie."
4,From the mouth of a 5 year-old,"My son is obsessed with this movie, as he is with everything Scooby. But he says he give it 4 stars instead of 5 because in this one the gang spends half the movie not being friends (but then they do make up)."
3,Excellent DVD,I Love both scooby dvds theres only one problem theres no trailers every dvd with no trailer gets 2 stars taking off.if im going to pay 20 something dollars it should have a trailer.
4,Very enjoyable,"If you simply remember this is NOT an epic film like Lord of the rings, you will not be disappointed. This is a fun movie. It was better than #1 in my opinion"
3,Not for this 4 year old,Bought this for a 4year old but much of the movie was over his head. He loves Scooby-Doo but I would suggest this i better suited for children a bit older.
4,zoinks!,"funny movie, good quality dvd, tons of fun extras. Fun for kids and adults who loved the cartoon. Ridiculous, but you will be entertained."
4,Pretty good movie,The 2nd scooby doo movie was as good as the first. Velma has a bigger part in the second scooby doo movie. It also has Seth Green and Alicia Silverstone in this one!One of my favorite parts was Velma in the Red leather suit next to Seth Green. Sarah Michelle Gellar is very good in this movie too (like always!)
5,Bittersweet (For Me At Least),Great film. We (me and my friend) saw it after I'd had my poodle of 10 years put to sleep. It definately cheered me up a bit. Very funny movie. Loved it all. I'm gonna buy it as soon as it's out.
5,The Alter Guild Book,bought to replace a much used personal copy~it is the quinticental authoritive text book and is much used to train new members of alter guilds
5,Elizabeth I,I really enjoyed this book.Elizabeth has a really interesting life and the Dead Famous author M
3,The Christology of the New Testament Review,"Although I have just begun reading this for a class to become a permanent deacon in my diocese and parish, I believe it will help me understand better the human side of Jesus Christ that we all seem to take for granted."
1,What the??,"This doll is too skinny. Rosie O'Donnell is much more plump than this doll portrays, and is therefore an unrealistic doll as well as not worth the money. Avoid this doll like the plague; wait 'till Bandai makes a fat Rosie O'Donnell doll. However, the head in proportion to the body is well done on this doll; her head is QUITE large."
4,Simply Delightful Read,"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner is a simply delightful read. You become friends with the characters, almost feeling as though you can reach out and touch them as you journey with them experiencing all of their joys and sorrows, ups and downs, love, betrayal and coming to terms with life's twists and turns. Bonnie, Thora, Ruby-Pearl and even Naz and Tilde have a story to tell. The author skillfully weaves their individual stories into a full bodied, well written and moving book.This is a must read for any serious ........ or not so serious Book Club ... again, simply delightful!"
3,It's okay,This was an okay read. It did start off pretty slow but picked up. The plot of the novel was a good one but I was disappointed at the book's ending. I figured there would be more to the story and the meeting at the end of the book. I don't want to say too much about it because I'd hate to give away the end of the novel.
3,Enjoyable read,The book starts off slow but builds to a climax that will shock those not paying close attention to details. An especially satisfying ending that completed all the storylines (not like some books that leave you wondering and empty).
4,"A Slow Start, But Heart-warming End","This book made me smile. My only qualm, is that it took me a while to get into it, because the beggining dragged for me. I must say though, as the book picked up, I became more in love with the characters. The plot thickened and I found myself completely engrossed. I found myself cheering for Bonnie all the way. By the time I closed the book, I was sad that the story had ended. This is a great piece of work, with some glitches, but I enjoyed the message."
4,Gets Better As It Goes Along,"I listened to this book as an Audible file that I'd bought a year ago and never got around to listening to. After setting out to lose some much UN-needed pounds, I came across this file and began to listen. I have to admit, at first, to listen was a bit of a chore, and my walk seemed to plod along. After a short while, the book got better, and as a result, my walk seemed to fly by. It seemed like as the book went on, it got so much better, and I started checking my ipod and hoping that I had awhile to go in the book because I didn't want it to end. Wonderful read!"
4,Not your typical fiction,"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner starts off extremely slow. So slow, in fact, that I started to put it down. However, I endured. And boy am I glad I did. About half way thru the story does pick up and I found myself not wanting to put it down!It is a refreshing change from Eric Jerome Dickey, E. Lynn Harris and the like.I recommend it!"
5,Great Read!!!,"As others have stated, the first 2 chapters or so are slow. From that point on, the book is captivating. A Must Read!!!!"
3,Cute Little Book,"This is an endearing read about a group of women in ""the old South"" that set out to save babies in their community. The book starts really slow but is worth it if you can endure until midway through."
5,Keep Reading Its not what you think,"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner is a truly entertaining, delightful read. It allows your mind to explore the possibilities of what a mission and a little spirit will allow a group of determined women to do. It maximizes the idea of what friendship and loyalty can do to inspire others to better days. The Sisterhood examines the idea that we are often torn between what we want to have. and what we have to have. The book shows how trying to have it all has serious consequences. This book is a favorite of mine. I can't wait to read another book by Andrea Smith."
5,True Women,"The characters in this book are phenomenal, everyone can relate to them. This book will make you laugh, cry, and at times frustrated, but the story will have you captivated. I couldn't put it down. It's a story of true women and true frienship."
2,Tom Clancy's Op-Center Mission of Honor: Without Honors,"I've been a fan of Tom clancy ever since the release of 'The Hunt for Red October'. Its a shame to say that the works of his successor to the Op-Center series, Jeff Rovin, does not possess the magic of a true Clancy novel.The first two novels of Rovin already disappointed me because it became more political and less thrilling. No strikes were made, all talk. His third book really let me down because through this book, Op-Centers Strike Team has been permanently dissolved. Yes, a covert non-military team was made to replace it but the Paladin could never measure up to the standards of the elite Striker.Another thing that disappointed me was the fact that Rovin deviated from one of the most popular trademark of a Clancy novel, REALISM. All this about Vodun and its leader doing magic and prophesies just don't cut it.If Clancy wants his and Mr. Pieczenic's creation to retain its good reputation, I suggest they either replace or train Rovin."
3,If you want Clancy - read Clancy.,"I picked up this book for two reasons: Tom Clancy's name was writ large across the cover and the topic dealt with the Vatican in a covert ""black ops"" sort of way. On closer inspection this book was written by one Jeff Rovin. I was also intrigued with the setting in Botswana (if you want more on Botswana, read Alexander McCall Smith - different, but enjoyable).The story plodded along and not a whole lot happened. The religious characters were believable - however the voodoo / vodun leader had some really supernatural passages. This is the first (and most likely last) Op-Center book I have read and the American operatives seemed there to have everybody make nice and shake hands. Once the action got started, the next chapter had you back in Washington DC and someone was sorting out their family life and/or troubles with the wife. No thank you.If you want a good political thriller, stick to Tom Clancy proper - not the publisher making money off of Tom Clancy's name."
1,This book is dragging on longer than the OJ trial,"I typically love Tom Clancy books.. but this one has been a sleeper since I started it. I don't think I've ever taken this long to read any book, especially not one of his. I've been reading this book for about 9 months now, and my wife keeps asking me why I'm still reading it if it's so boring - my response is that I'm ""hoping"" it will redeem itself.. not to mention that I'm committed to finishing it. I am about 80% done with it, and still waiting for it to grab my attention."
1,clancy should be ashamed to be associated with such drivel,I'm a Clancy addict. I decided to try one of the op-center series. This was it. Don't waste your time. run and find another author in the genre. This aint clancy not even close.
1,"Terrible, boring, long.","This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. It was a struggle to get though it.Too many characters to keep track of. None of them all that interesting. The chapters in DC were tedious, the chapters in Botswanna were enough to keep me trudging along.It was too long at 418 pages and had lousy ending.Very disappointing with Tom Clancy's name on it. Jeff Rovin authored it and barely held my interest.I would've stopped reading this book but once I start reading a book I finish it come hell or high water."
2,slow story telling and poor ending,I was quite disappointed on how it ended. I thought it was very slow progression of story up until the 2/3 of the book. Then it was quite capturing for a while. But it ended so quickly without any good explination or story line. I read other Tom Clancy books and I was very let down on lack of details and sofistication at the end.
1,MISSION OF HONOR - NOT,"THIS IS AWFUL. THIS IS NO TOM CLANCY BOOK. EVER READ A WHOLE BOOK AND AT THE END THOUGHT WHAT WAS THIS ???WHAT WAS THIS ABOUT? WHAT WAS THIS AS A STORY? WHO CARES? THIS IS AWFUL, MORE THAN AWFUL. IF THERE WAS A MINUS MINUS MINUS I'D PUT IT ON THIS MISERABLE BOOK. I LOVE CLANCEY AND I THINK THIS ""FRANCHISE IDEA"" THAT HE HAS ONLY WORKS IF THE AUTHOR KNOWS HOW TO WRITE, HOW TO TELL A STORY...THIS IS STUPID. I'M GOING TO TOSS IT IN THE TRASH SO NO ONE ELSE IN MY FAMILY OR GROUP OF FRIENDS GETS CAUGHT READING IT, HOPING FOR SOME PAYOFF AND GETTING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING...THIS REMINDS ME OF A BOOK WRITTEN BY A COMMITTEE...OF IDIOTS."
1,not here yet,i ordered this movie exactly 1 month ago and still have not recieved it. i'm very displeased at the moment and hope eventually it will arrive.
5,Dream a little dream,One of the best love stories written for it's time. Proof again that love endures all. Even my kids love to watch this movie over and over. Thanks for having it.
3,back in time to the 80's.,"same plot as lot's of movies,before,and after this one.the 80's movies are my favorite,so i'll watch anything.not a bad movie,you know boy loves girl,girl loves someone else,boy finally gets girl.everyone dreams of that,but it never works out like in the movies.rent it,and if you like buy it."
4,One of my favorites,"Well, my opinion of this film is skewed. I really loved this film when it came out. The concept was neat and the acting, IMO, was really good. Corey was wrapped up in drug controversy at this time, but still did a pretty good job.The film is basically about an older man (probably in his 70s) who is experimenting with the idea of existing in a dream, and a high school kid that is having all of the normal teenage issues of the 80s. The two end up switching bodies when the man's experiment goes wrong, and the rest of the film is about how a teenager could succeed if they only had the experience of a 70 year old man. Lots of humor. This film was aimed at a teenage audience of the 80s. Take a chance and enjoy this film!"
4,Very Fun!,"Dreams...what are they? In this very fun offering, we are taken into the drama of teen life and the lack of understanding from the adults that are around. Or, maybe the lack of teens to see a bigger picture? No matter how you see this quiet little gem there is something for young and old alike. How anyone cannot watch and be facinated and thrilled with seeing it from both sides in such an original way is beyond me! Way good fun so just watch and I'm sure you will agree."
2,"Too old to appreciate, I guess","I SAW THIS MOVIE MANY YEARS AGO. MY DAUGHTER WANTED IT FORHER BIRTHDAY. SHE LOVES IT, and all the old movies from the 80'swhich I usually love, but this wasn't one of them."
1,notkewl,I love this old movie but it was obviously not an original copy. It was dubbed and was bad quality.
5,The 80's at it's finest! Not to be missed!,"I saw this movie when it first came out... I""ve owned the soundtrack on tape and now on CD... I've bought the movie used from a video store when I couldn't find it new - and I hope that it will somehow get onto DVD... The movie is a must see if not a must own.. the Soundtrack is a MUST OWN for sure... one of my fave's of all time with it's ONLY problem being that it doesn't have the song ""Where Is She"" by Blue Future on it - if you've seen the movie, you know the song... other than that it's near perfection... another great soundtrack ""The Lost Boys"" ironically another Corey/Corey tagteam hit..."
5,I can't get enough,"Why is this movie not available anymore? Where else can you see Corey Feldman dance like Michael Jackson and watch Corey Haim play the sarcastic sidekick with a name like Dinger? I don't have one childhood memory in from of the TV that doesn't include this movie, and now that I'm in my 20s, it's starting all over again. I watch this movie a couple times a week and never get sick of it. I would love to see it on DVD soon! I can promise to buy at least 10 copies on my own, and i suggest you all do the same! The 80s just wouldn't be the 80s without these two guys and this wonderful movie!!!"
5,80's movie,"this a good corey haim, corey feldman movie. feldman is in love with his best friend's girl and somehow he and her become the old couple who live not far from their school and he they have to figure out how to get back to themselves again."
4,Dream a little dream,This product was good. I like Corey Feldman and Corey Haim. It was good seeing them in there time of glory.
4,"An oldie, but a goody!!!!",I have seen this movie on tv and I said yo myself this is not a bad movie. What I like most about the movie is Meredith Dawn Salenger. This girl is as cute as can be and that body is to die for. Anyway the movie and the soundtrack compliment each oth. What I did not care for was Corey Feldman's Micxhael Jackson phase he webt through it was chesses at its best. Go out and buy this movie if you like 80's movie this one is a classics in its own way.
5,20 years later or more,"I first read this book when it came out in the 80's, this book introduced me to the careers of William Desmond Taylor and MMM, I already knew a little about Mabel. I loved the mystery surrounding the case and how it has never been solved. I bought the new book mainly because my original was pretty beat up and it's one of those books I like to bring out now and then and re read. There is a new intro from the author and the bio's at the back have been updated slightly, no new pics which would have been nice but all in all I love revisiting this story. Does it solve the mystery??? Depends on your views, everyone who knows of the case has their own opinion but I enjoyed the book and am glad to have it in my collection."
4,I love a good mystery,I read this book when it was first published. Loved it then and still do. The Taylor mystery will never be really solved so the theories will go on forever. Thanks to Amazon for making these books available to people like me who live abroad and can't visit a bookstore regularly.
4,Very good read,"I found the book compelling. I had heard some about the story before (even Wiki has an entry), but this book actually spells it out rather well, and does leave you with a conclusion as to ""who done it"". As the subject says, a very good read."
2,Greatly improved over the original edition.,"Edited Review: By correcting or qualifying most of the historical errors found in the 1986 edition, this twentieth anniversary edition has greater historical value, while losing none of the entertainment value of the original edition. I would now improve its rating if I could."
3,Solved the mystery but barely kept us awake,"This is a fine book on a fascinating story. I thought he research was exceptional and while I like how he overlayed it on his personal life, the conclusions drawn in his relationships were not developed and therefore intrusive.If you like a mystery read, this is a good book but didn't bring me to the edge of my seat."
5,Awesome movie,It was entertaining and funny would I buy the next season part 2 .Yes I would my niece could not stop laughing so yes this movie was totally awesome looking forward to getting the next one. Thank you
5,WOW,Wow this is one the funniest Anime i have ever seen and i fell in love with all the charicters i have seen the whole searise many times and love it im looking forward to adding it to my collection!!
5,i love these boys,I love Host club. I was worried about what the english version would do to it. I wasn't disappointed.
5,I LOVE OURAN HIGH SCHOOL HOST CLUB!,"I love this anime so, so, so much! Ouran High School Host Club is such a great anime! It has comedy and romance. Everything I pretty much look for in an anime! The romance in it makes me want more and more of Ouran. It's like a love triangle between Tamaki, Hiakru, and Haruhi! So cute.Ouran has some famous voice too, like: Vic Mignogna (Edward Elric, Dark Mousy, Zero Kiryu), Todd Haberkorn (Allen Walker, Ling Yao, Deatht the Kid), Caitlyn Glass (Winry), J. Michael Tatum (Scar in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood), Greg Ayres (Satoshi) Travis Willingham (Roy Mustang), Luci Christian (Risa Harada), Mike McFarland (Jean Havoc). Now that's what I call a great group of voice actors! Even in one episode Aaron Dismuke (Alphonse Elric, Ion Fortuna) shows up!Ouran has everything a girl wants! Even some guys! Please, I recommend anyone to give Ouran a try ^^"
4,A Fun Comedy,"This series is similair to Fruits Basket and has plenty of moments that should keep you laughing. This is the second half of the series continueing the mishapped adventures of a girl that ends up becoming part of a club of guys whose job it is to make every girl that goes to there school happy. Do to an accident she ends up having to pretend to be one of the boys and works to pay off her debt, but all the while the boys of the group fight and flirt for attention while trying to keep the rest of the school out of the loop. Through her interactions with the club she helps each member in a different way. Hate to be vague, but the fancy tuna won't stay around long."
4,"Good, But Could Be Foxier","I am a huge Sam Fox fan and when I saw this album, I was overjoyed! There are some of her less-than-stellar tracks (Just One Night, which *is* funny at the end, Hold On Tight, and in my opinion, her worst song - Spirit of America), but there are also some great Sam tunes. You get the rare radio edits of ""Naughty Girls,"" ""I Wanna Have Some Fun,"" and ""Love House."" You also get the brilliant video version of ""Another Woman (Too Many People)."" Along with those gems comes three rare b-sides ""Hot Lovin'"" (from the ""Hurt Me"" single), ""Giving Me A Hard Time,"" & ""Even In The Darkest Hours"" (from a rare Japanese remix CD). And even more fun - there's a hidden 18th track - the Sam Fox UK Megamix. Although it's only four and a half minutes, it's very cool to have and a true rarity. Don't miss this CD if you're a Foxy fan!"
2,Touch Sam Fox? If you insist!,"When Samantha Fox went from Page 3 nude modelling to singing on pop records produced by Stock Aitken and Waterman, I think it would be fair to say that she had BIG THINGS in FRONT of her.""Touch Me"" is classic 80's pop - synthesized, overtly sexual and cheesier than a ball of Edam. Download it and store it in your ""Classic 80s females"" folder alongside Bananarama, Debbie Gibson, Martika, Sabrina, Sinita, Madonna and Belinda Carlisle."
2,Naughty Girls Need Love Too,This CD was great in my younger years. But when you have the advances that we do today the sound of the cd is seriously old school. Great trip down memory lane.
5,I Miss Aaliyah!,"I love this song. Aaliyah will be truely missed. The items that overloaded the plane and caused it to crash should have been sent home through the mail (FedEx, UPS, etc.) She is a celeberity. She and the pople working with her have the money to do that. Her death could have been avoid if she did that. RIP AALIYAH!!!!!!!!"
4,WE MISS YOU BABYGURL,"This song is sooo great! The remix is OKAY but I like it. Even though this cd on has 2 songs,it is worth your $... Aaliyah really deserves it,and she is a great artist that is truely missed. R.I.P. Babygurl"
3,the other reviewer is WAY off...,"on his facts.connelly has NOTHING to do with this cd, other than he WROTE ""ignition x4"" (see phenobarb bambalam). this project is actually the vehicle of atkins and mary byker (pigface, gaye bykers on acid). you'll prolly recognise mary's voice from such pigface classics (classics???) like ""auto hag"", ""seven words"" and ""satellite"". instead of grabbing this cd though, why dontchs get either ""fook"" by pigface (if you dont already own it) or grab ""gboa"" by gaye bykers on acid (i mean, with song titles like ""killer teens in new orleans"" and ""john wayne was a fag"", do i REALLY need to explain???)."
3,Good lineup at least,"Connely and Atkins are the most famous people that hide behind this record. It's pretty much like Connely's solo project, but a bit worse. It's okay. You have to own one copy of this record if you love everything Connely has made."
4,Nice looking and great workmanship,"Being tired of cutting cheese with regular knives, or the wire cutting devices, I decided to finally purchase some actual 'cheese knives'. These work well, and look lovely. They wouldn't be suitable for large cheese rounds however. A bigger knife would be needed. But I'm finally happy and proud when I serve cheese to my guests, and proud of the look and quality of these knives."
3,stainless steel cheese knives work a treat,I finally received my knives and must say that they look very stylish and having used them - I can only say what a good buy this was -
1,it leaked water at 20m and they wont stand behind it!,"i bought this watch from justcalculators. it worked fine in the pool, shower. but when i took it diving to 20m, it leaked. and now i can't get casio to stand behind it, and fix it for me. although i had it for only 4 months. it sucks. i am upset. wont ever buy one of these again, although this was my third. i am disgusted!!"
1,Never received my order!,"Never received my order! It's been more than 30 days. I contacted the seller. I have not received any response, either."
4,"Yes, it's greasy but at least it's not lotion.","Smells good. Doesn't leave you feeling clammy like lotion does. It's a good moisturizer, but beware the grease! Oh, and don't leave it in the car - it melts all over. Save it for nighttime."
1,Very expensive -- Don't buy,"This is so bad! VERY GREASY. It was a tiny amount in a small tin -- yes, it says .3 oz but I was desparate for a good product. Don't buy it -- it's EXPENSIVE AND DOES NOT WORK!"
2,Wasn't Impressed,"I bought this to help with dry patches on my palms and knuckles due to frequent washings and hand sanitizer use during cold & flu season. As soon as I opened it and smoothed a little on the back of my hand, I realized this would be for overnight only use as it is quite greasy and takes time to be absorbed. I've used it nightly for 2 weeks now and it hasn't helped; I still have dry patches on my palms even though I've also switched handsoap. I like the thick foot cream and liquid handsoap made by this company, but I just don't like this product. I wish I'd spent the money on a hand lotion with shea butter instead."
4,"Great, if it was not so expensive!","This salve, when I started purchasing it, started out at 4.99, now it is about $8. It does work well, but I find the price now to be a bit high per ounce. For that reason, I had to find an alternative. Bag Balm works just as well, at you get 3 times a much for about the same price! As much as I love Burt's Bees items, they are now to expensive for my taste. So if you have the money to blow, go for Burt's Salve, but if you want the same results but for way cheaper, go with Bag Balm. I am now a Bag Balm girl!"
3,Greasy,"This product may be effective, but I find it unnecessarily greasy. It's messy to the point of causing fingerprints to be left on things that you handle after use. Also smells odd, more chemical/waxy than floral or herbal."
3,"""Lost"" is the keeper here","""Roy's Keen"" is a weak weak song from the Maladjusted album, whose mild hook is marred by frustratingly weak lyrics. ""The Edges Are No Longer Parallel"" is nice enough, but loses steam throughout it's running time...not a bad b-side though. the saving grace of this single is ""Lost"" with it's magnificent flow and an almost dreamy, airy sense of timing. it's really a great song that should have been included on the full-length album."
4,Good,"This is a good mechanical watch, for the price. the wristband is a little sketchy...but ok. according to the instructions, this watch is also slightly automatic...though i haven't had a chance to test that out. All in all, good watch"
3,Rat-People!,I have to say for a after Dark film it was not to bad. Its better than the first batch they threw out at us. The script follows of group of people living in a run down apartment building. The plague is spread through rats and once bitten you transform into rat. Thats right you transform into a rat. Not completely but just some of the features. This makes for a intresting take on the whole eating people thing. Instead of zombies you are rat-people. The movie starts out kind of slow and then finally picks up then they unleash the carnage. It kind of ends there but for the most part it is entertaining. Just dont aspect to much. The acting is average the gore pretty good. I say its at least a rent but maybe you would want to watch this one before buying.
4,Surprisingly good!!!,"I didn't think that I would like this movie,I thought that it would be just a dumb B movie! But I was pleasently surprised by this movie! This movie really made me care about the characters and made me wonder who would still be alive at the end. It was also nice to see some Latino characters in a good movie, since Hollywood seems to have forgotten about us. But I digress, Mulberry Street is worth watching even though the premise of people turning into Rat/Human hybrids seems silly at first but then again people accept Werewolves and Vampires and other assorted creatures just fine. This movie is worth a watch, I don't think that you'll regret it!"
4,Rat salad anyone?,"Holy cow! I'm not one to get all excited by an indie horror movie but this movie would have to be the exception.The people of NYC are under attack by rats. The government has quarantined Manhattan and all hell's broken loose! Those who've been bitten have mutated into ""rat people.""This movie makes you care about the characters which makes it that much harder to see them die. I really liked this flick and highly recommend it."
3,Rat-a-tat Fantastic,"While I love horror movies, one about rodents usually aren't my thing. However, I enjoyed almost all of the 2006 Horrorfest films, so I was excited to find out there were more the next year! Mulberry Street is the first of the 2007 Horrorfest films that I watched.I happened to watch it the same week I saw ""I Am Legend"" and while they are certainly similar in subject matter, they're both very different films.Mulberry Street is pretty good. The film is choppy and extremely dark, which frequently makes it hard to tell what is going on. But, that kind of adds to the suspense. The actors are all superb, especially the performances by Kim Blair and Nick Damici. The movie spends a lot developing the characters. All of them are interesting human beings with a story and not the usual ""hot"" bunch of teenagers.The ending was a little bit of a shock, but I don't need neat, tidy endings all the time anyway, because let's face it life isn't always neat and tidy.Good film."
2,blah,this movie is the worst movie in the 07 set and i would not buy this movie maybe rent it if you just have to see it
1,Rent it on NetFlix someday.,"This was another waste of $14+. The acting was fair, but the story was weak and disjointed. This is yet another in a long line of failures in the ""AfterDark Horrorfest."" If you absolutely MUST watch this DVD, rent it. Don't buy it. Really. It's not worth keeping."
3,The Zombie Movie of Rats,"They could have used any infection and gotten the same result, rats seemed like a cop-out for me. The story seemed to be like Dawn of the Dead if it had been crammed into a single night. Also, are we to believe that in the entire city, only 2-3 people owned a gun? The characters that were enjoyable were killed off or never got enough screen time, and the ending left off in an allusion like we were supposed to feel something, but there was nothing to feel.While entertaining for the first watch, theres no urge to watch it again, except in the background during a party on Halloween night."
4,"loved the cast, cinematography","The story here is a little flimsy, and at times the ""rat/people/zombies"" looked kinda silly, but overall I very much enjoyed this one. The cast was very ""average joe"", like you could run into any of these people on the street. This lent a realism to the film that so many other movies lack. I also enjoyed the cinematography quite a bit. Instead of making everything too dark as so many horror films do, instead we get our heroes fleeing to a rooftop in a washed out shade of blue, while the government haz mat team is filmed in bright yellow and orange ascending the stairs. Doesn't sound like much but little touches like that made the film visually interesting to watch. Another example is a very brief shot of what looks like two yellow lights on the street, then one turns to red and the viewer realizes the second yellow light is actually the moon. Nice touch."
5,YOU WANT THIS ALBUM,"This album is fantastic! It is such a relief to find a fresh, new sound with all the canned, drum machine, mixed stuff out right now. I met her in TN (she's really sweet) and purchased the album from her and lost it. Quickly, I found I missed it in my collection so bought another. Amy has recorded a great album that nicely blends the blues, country and jazz. What an amazing sound that is perfect for any setting. Her voice transfers the depth of the lyrics and the songs are relatable. The song choices range from the deep (This World is Not My Own) to the whimsy (Sailing??)and it is a purchase I encourage any music fan to make. Best album I've purchased in years."
2,"""Do What You Do"" is great; the others are not so great ..........","She has a pleasant voice but her song writing leaves a lot to be desired. On this cd she has written only one good song out of ten, and even that is co-written. What has turned it into a great song is outstanding production by Brown Bannister.This song was the beginning and end of my interest in Carolyn. One out of ten is a strike rate that would give you a shelf full of cds you never listen to. But in saying that, if you don't have a copy of ""Do What You Do"", I unreservedly recommend you buy the mp3, and if you like the song as much as I do, you'll then want the better sound quality found on the cd.Then again, with 18 copies of the cd here for a cent at present, maybe that is the way to go first up."
5,getting better,"Didnt know what to expect when I first picked up this econd release by Carolyn. Thought it would be lesser in sound and song strength. WRONG!! This Cd is even better and is so different from her debut! I love people and artists who change and dont stay the same. The blend oof rock and light jazz and even still just a hint of country on ""Do We Dare"" is brill! This album has some of the best songs ever on it. Listen away to ""Big Deal"" and ""This I know"", they will blow you away. Lovely song about Mark, her hubbie on this Cd although i think ""The day will never come"" on her next one is better but still this song is not flawed! AWESOME KEEP IT UP CAZ!"
5,A BOOK THAT WILL BRING YOU BACK IN TOUCH WITH REALITY,"A BOOK THAT MADE ME CRY FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I MET GABE!! THIS IS A BOOK THAT WILL MAKE YOU FORGET THAT IT'S ONLY FICTION. GABE IS A MAN WITH A BAD HEART. HE IS ARTISTIC,SMART,AND HAS A WONDERFUL PASSION FOR LIFE!!!! THIS BOOK WILL HAVE YOU CRYING AND FALLING IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!"
5,I loved it!! It's excellent and very emotional!!,Everyone should read this book!! I haven't read any other books in the Dear Diary collection but their probably just as great!!
1,Not worth it,"I ordered the book based on the positive reviews. I'm thankful I read it before I read it to my grandchildren. I'm returning it immediately. I thought the illustrations and the story would be scary for my kids. I certainly didnt like them but then, I don't like Where The Wild Things Are."
3,The Danridge File!,"I think that Berry does a good job of Mrs Danridge. This is a very thought out movie bassed on her life. Do your self a favor, and pick this one up to night."
4,Dandridge,"This movie was spectacular from a ""made for t.v."" movie stand point. Halle Berry was an exceptional choice to play the role of Ms. Dandridge. All my life, I have been a fan of Dorothy dandridge and I was happy to see a film depicting her life. It was very well put together but focused little on what Dorothy was known for, her movie career. Dorothy Dandridge was the first black woman to be nominated for an Acamedy Award. She had many stellar and standout performances including ""Porgy and Bess"", ""Island in the Sun"", and ""Carman Jones"". I would have liked to see more of the film cover her outstanding film career. The film did however show her fight against racism in the music as well as film inmdustry. She was a one of kind woman and this film is definitely worth watching if not owning."
3,Good but not great,"Halle Berry casted as the late great Dorothy D. was brilliant! Imagine the nerve of that laughably bad acting Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson wanting to play D.D! Oh Pleeezzee! Back to my point, some of the parts in this movie was very ""ho-hum"" like the previous reviewer had stated and I felt that this movie had left off a couple of moments in Dorothy D.'s life that should have been included. Introducing Dorothy Dandridge was a bit flawed and VERY rushed, but nonetheless, it was entertaining. I recommend David Bogel's book "" Dorothy Dandrige the autobiography"" to get a well done and detailed story about this facinating woman."
3,Dorothy Dandridge,At the beginning I thought... hey this might just be good... oh Halle Berry... though she bears a remarkable resembelence to the real actress(RIP)... By the end of the movie... I had no love left for Halle or her performance... I say pass on this one...
4,Halle Berry is great,"but thsi film suffers from too much gloss over the real fact why She didn't blow up properly Race.Dorothy Dandridge had everything that Monroe,Welch,&other Beautys had&more but Her Shade was Her Sin.Halle Berry is dealing with issues in Hollywood as well always getting typedcast even though She does a wide range of films SHe still has to battle.that's why She seems at ease doing Dorothy Dandridge.She feels the same vibe even today.i agree with the other Reviewers here Whitney&Janet no thank you.they still haven't proving that they can act in music videos let alone doing a Film on Something this special&ground-breaking."
4,Berry does a bang-up job!,"This docu-drama is one of the best of its genres. Halle Berry does justice to the great Dorothy Dandridge, and the tale of her life (both before, during and after Hollywood) is heartbreaking. The only problem I have with this DVD is a technical one - the sound seems to be out-of-balance, with background noise often overpowering the dialogue."
4,Great role for Halle,"This was a very good biopic profiling the life of a African-American legend, based on the Dandridge bio written by her former manager, Earl Mills. Okay, there may have been some parts that were glossed over and weren't totally accurate, but it is still an enjoyable film. I was impressed with Halle Berry's performance, because in other movies she's been in prior to this, she usually didn't show much range (exception: ""Jungle Fever""). But in ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"", she proved herself to be a credible actress. She did a great job of bringing Ms. Dandridge's story to life. Worth checking out."
4,Berry & Spiner shine,"Words are not enough to describe Halle Berry's performance, she pulls off a host of emotions with flawless grace. Brent Spiner amazingly matches her pace as the pitiful manager with effortless ease. Any holes in the script are masked by the two magnetic leads with a great example of how acting should be."
3,"RENT ""CARMEN JONES"" FOR THE REAL THING!","She was the true black superstar --- gorgeous, talented, sexy, vulnerable, a woman who became the first black to ever be nominated fore a Best Actress Oscar. Dorothy Dandridge also had a life of pain and suffering --- marriages and love affairs that would break her heart, abuse, addictions . . . death at too far an early age, with barely a penny in the bank. Halle Berry does an acceptable job filling Dorothy's shoes, but to truly understand what the fuss was all about, rent ""Carmen Jones"" or ""Porgy and Bess."""
2,not so good.....,"The ring fell off within days, so I had to carry it in my hand or in a pocket. The cap kept falling off as well. There are other flash drives out there that do a better job of staying intact, so I'm buying a different one."
4,Good memory,"The 2GB flash is good, very quick. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the metal ring that connects to the lanyard is extremely weak. I wouldn't trust it to hold the flash drive. If you stick the memory in your pocket instead of using a lanyard, this is a great buy!"
3,Z-Mate USB 2.0 Flash Memory Pen Drive Works but...,I ordered the Z-Mate Flash memory drive because I wanted portable storage which I could put on my keyring (so I wouldn't lose it).The pen drive functions fine but the weak little keyring attachment broke off within about 30 minutes of me attaching it to my keyring :(. So much for that idea....
5,Never Had a Problem,At this point I usually only buy the Dane-Elec jump drives. I experimented for awhile with different brands but find that the Dane is the easiest to use and the sturdiest. I won't mention the other brands by name but am very familiar with two. One of them proved too fragile and the other made me jump through a bunch of hoops before I began using it. I do wish that the price of these would come down though as I usually pay about 10 to 11 for one or 20 for two at a local big box stores. The reason I go through so many is that I make videos and save them on the drives. Then I retire them once the flash drives fill up. I've never had a problem with the Danes and am working on my second drive for the year.
1,Ouch - my aching knees!,"I have attempted to use this machine several different times and each time my knees really ache after 2-3 days of use. I thought it was just me until I read the reviews. I would not recommend this product if you have any problems with your knees, which I do not and I intend to keep it that way!"
5,Lateral Thigh Trainer,"I give it 5 stars for right now. I bought it on www.qvc.com and received it within 4 days and have always had good service from them. It was also on www.asseenontv.com. Unfortunately, I have not cared for their slow service in the past and they were higher priced. This machine is quiet and fun to use. If you want to get in a higher heart rate target zone it helps to turn the machine over and turn the turnbuckle at the bottom clockwise that increased the pedal height. The power cords helped to increase the heart rate too. I will put up an update in the next 90 days."
2,Mine Lasted Six Months,"I absolutely loved the machine, it was easy to use and really provided a great workout. But the right step broke after six months. How much does a gym membership cost?"
2,"Great idea, poor design?","Just wanted to echo what I have read here and experienced myself: I'm a trucker and had this piece of equipment for a couple years before I started using it and it was great! Except after only a couple of months now, indeed it has broken down, the squeaking was bothersome but I lived with it, and the tension bar did fail. But I still had a great workout until yesterday when the actual metal bar beneath the pedal literally began splitting in two and it's now a piece of junk. I'm not abnormally overweight, just 145lbs or so when I started using the LTT. I loved what it did for me all the way until the thing completely broke down, and the workouts were only 35 minutes a day. So I have to echo the other remarks of poor quality for a product with a great initial idea behind it. I won't be buying another one."
1,Piece of junk!,"If you have read the majority of the reviews for this product you quickly get the idea. Mine worked for about 15 minutes before the bearing started to sieze. When I received a replacement, it worked for about 30 minutes before the same thing happened.I am surprised that Amazon still offers such a clearly defective product. It certainly does their image no good."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"I bought the extended warranty- thank goodness!!! because I went through one trainer every 30 days. These machines are garbage, the people who made these machines rely on people who purchase the machine and then don't use it. I used it every day for 30 minutes and returned 3 machines. The first problem: The chain broke. Second problem: The tension adjuster snapped. Third problem: the frame cracked. I am not a heavy person either, the unit is just not made to be actually used."
2,Very Disappointed...,"I bought my LTT about a year ago to help get rid of the baby fat I had gained from my pregnancy. I used it 6 days a week for 30 min. and also used 5 lb. free weights while using the machine. It started squeking about three months after I bought it but it wasn't too much of an annoyance with the TV on however, the chain has broken four times already and the hook that connects the chain has now broken. I only weigh 156 pounds, so I can't be the problem. My husband has fixed it everytime that it has broke but when the hook that connects the chain broke last night, my husband suggested buying something else because it is becoming time consuming and costly to fix this machine every other day (literally).<br />I would say spend your money on something else, although heavy, the gears and chain construction is not good."
2,Not well built or worth the price,"This is not as easy as it looks on tv. Thats fine and I dont mind the challenge. However, the motion is not as smooth as they make it seem on tv. Im pretty coordinated and dont have difficulty find a rhythm but the motion seems jerky and like it sticks. I oiled the places it suggestied in the guidbook but I dont think it helped at all. It definitely doesnt look or feel like it would hold up to daily use for even a few months. SAVE YOUR MONEY! I saw a lot of negative reviews about customer service however I havent dealt with them so my review is soley based on the product."
1,Horrible,"I only used it twice, I couldn't stand the noise it made. Poorly designed. I would NOT get this product!!"
2,Bad Knees - Bad Workout,"The commercial makes this look so easy but if you have bad knees, forget it. I'm 54, arthritic and out of shape. I could not use this machine for longer than 3 minutes at a time. It was a waste of my money and I gave it to my daughter who is using it. The bottom line is, you have to be in decent shape to use this or else it just sits on the floor gathering dust."
4,I love it!!!,I love this! I have had it for 3 weeks and so far it is perfect! No squeaks at all. I have been wanting something that I could keep in my living room and exercise while my family and I are just sitting around watching tv. I do it at least 2 times a day for 15 min each. If you are not used to using a stair stepper this might not be the one for you because you do not have support. My mom has some neck problems and she tried it and complained that it hurt her back because of having no support such as handles to hang on to. A great workout!
3,a prisoner of war movie,"In World war one prisoners were treated relatively well,but it was still their duty to tryto escape. This movie is about three French officerswho are together in a number of Germany camps.Finally they are held in an old castle by someone they think of as a friend.One of the fellows sacrifices himself so that two others can escape.There is an element of the world changing and a previewof the German and French hatred for Jews here.For the time the movie is very well done."
5,Grand Illusion,"One of the great achievements in world cinema, Renoir's ""The Grand Illusion"" explores the seemingly arbitrary borders of class, language, and citizenship that divide us. Banned by the Nazis on the eve of WWII, ""Illusion"" remains a compelling hybrid of the prison-escape genre and Renoir's own brand of warm, humanistic drama, characterized by the easygoing interactions between soldiers and prisoners. Expertly directed and wonderfully acted by Gabin, Fresnay, Von Stroheim, and Marcel Dalio as French-Jewish compatriot Rosenthal, ""Illusion"" is ultimately a brilliant critique of war itself. It was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in 1938."
2,Unrealistic garbage,"Amazing restoration, unfortunately, the film does not hold up well over time. The comments from the director about how WW1 was a ""gentleman's War"" only corroborate his lack of vision as to what war really means. WW1 was far from a gentleman's war ( can any war be truly that?) and the movie's very basis falls apart as we see the prisoners trying to escape from what appears to be very relaxed, humane prison camps. I cannot say if such nice prison camps existed in WW1, but I am sure that few prisoners would have tried to escape from them if they had, in order that they might fight again. WW1 was a nasty, ugly war, with human wave attacks from trenches, filled with mustard gas. The idea that prisoners wanted to escape as these did is preposterous.Over rated and poorly scripted---truly a disappointing fantasy. For a true masterpiece of WW1 cinema, see ""All Quiet on the Western front"" written by the French/German Erich Maria Remarque."
5,The Restoration is Incredible!,"I watched La Grande Illusion several times, mostly on video. When I got the DVD I was amazed at how good the images were! Watch the restoration clips just to see how all the scratches that we have become accustomed to have been removed!As to the movie I think this is one of the greatest ever made. Watch how the subjects of honor, camaraderie, and humanity are treated. Watch how they all get together around meals. Nobody likes the war, and enemies understand each other: they all want it to come to an end. After that, go read the poetry of Wilfred Owen. Judging from the wars we let happen, we have certainly not learned."
4,An essential Skynyrd CD,"As we know,this was released soon after the fatal plane crash. Skynyrd fans were still smarting from the loss and this helped ease the pain.The songs are some of Ronnie's most personal,although less commercial,and the inclusion of the Rickey Medlocke tunes is such a sweet bonus. This is a must have for Skynyrd fan's looking to get into Ronnie, and Medlocke's,artistic honesty.This is a very personal album, and I love it."
5,Underrated,"This is probably my favorite BDP album. It has great lyrics, great beats, and is really a personal album. KRS-One talks about issues dealing with sex, drugs, and violence. I can't believe that this got bad reviews when it first came out. Favorites include Duck Down, Like a Throttle, Build and Destroy, Poisonous Products, Questions and Answers, and Sex and Violence. Get this and all of BDP's albums to support the real hip hop."
4,yo. nuf respect,this album has been dissed plenty and neva gets the props it deserves bpd rule forever seeen?
2,BDP's worst album,"BDP were inarguably one of the most important pioneers of the hip hop scene. Born into Bronx NY, hip hop's birthplace, BDP has released many classic albums: ""Criminal Minded"", ""By All Means Necessary"", ""Ghetto Music..."", etc. However ""Sex and Violence"" is a complete mess. One can only imagine that KRS-One was fed up with the hip hop scene of 1992/1993, with gangster rappers like Dre and Snoop in the spotlight. The result: irresponsible junk like ""13 and good."" For a more representative sample of BDP/KRS-One, I'd recommend ""Live-Hardcore-Worldwide"" or the phenomenal Return of the Boom-Bap, with DJ Premier on the beats.-Matt McGrath"
3,Waterproof MP3 Player 1GB,"I purchased this product because I cycle and kayak and wanted a mp3 player that would hold up under adverse conditions, which this product seems to do. However, it has several major disadvantages.1. Can only charge the battery with a USB cable and computer, thus making it difficult to carry on weekend camping trips and recharging.2. I have used 3 different laptops all fairly new with windows 2000 or XPpro, and all computers have problems recognizing the player when you plug in the USB cable.3. There is no play list manager, so you have to scroll through all songs to find the ones you wnat, with a 1 gig memory that is a lot of looking for a song, on a screen you can barely see."
2,Update vrsion (MP121) is vastly superior,"Oregon Scientific's newer version (MP121)is light years ahead of the original(MP120). Here are the improvements over this model: I swim a 1/2 mile several times/week and found this to be flawless: great sound, new, improved earbuds with ear loops really stay in place (during active crawl stroke)... no water in ear (added benefit for people like me who are prone to swimmer's ear). Bigger, easy to read screen with a much more user friendly menu interface (don't have to scroll thru all your songs...you can search by artist). I would strongly advise going for the MP 121 (also on Amazon) and give up the extra 1/2 gig of storage on this model in exchange for a much superior product. The only reason I give the MP 120 2 stars is that it has worked trouble free for over a year(I had a problem when I first got it, Oregon Scientific replaced it promptly)"
1,Oregon Scientific MP3 needs help,"I have a Oregon Scientific 120 and a 121 model, both are lacking in headphone department. They won't stay in while swimming. I tried the Freestyle audio and their head phones get wet and stop working. The only MP3 player that works like it's suppose to is the product by ""Swimman"" where they waterproof a Ipod shuffle from the inside, pared with their waterproof headphones that are like using bose ear buds under water this unit is a dream and highly recommended!!!!"
4,Trotsky For Begginers,"An excellent introduction to some very complex and confusing history. This biography of Leon Trotsky, also explores some very complex marxist theory. Historically, it covers not only Trotsky's life and idea's, but the Russian Revolution, the Russian civil war, and the usurpation of power of the fledgling workers democracy by Joseph Stalin and his co-conspiritors from the democratically elected politburo. This book is much more entertaining then the new ""For Begginers"" series, as it has much more artistic diversity, then the mostly cartoon, drawing style of the new books. It contains colages, and many photos of historical figures and events. Overall a great introduction to history, that is not taught in school."
1,Can't rate it cause it's not a Kindle Book!,"Will you ever make this book Kindel friendly??? I have been waiting for this book to go Kindel for at least a year. I would love to read it as I enjoyed all the others, but don't understand why you put all the others on Kindle, but miss the one the continues the store line??"
2,Small is the size of a Large,"Ordered slicker brush in a size small, thinking it would be smaller than the brush my husband had purchased in a size large at the local farm store. When I received the brush it was the same size as the large. Will not return due to the shipping charge. Still too large to use on a teacup yorkie. Still looking for small slicker brush. Disappointed in size. Also it claimed to be a soft slicker brush, but the only thing soft was the handle, and it was rubber coated."
4,A lovely story for children,"On a fashionable street lined with brownstones, one home is empty, too run-down for the ""fashionable"" people to move in. One day, Mr. Crockett moves in and, to the neighbors' astonishment, begins to clean the building himself. In front of each of the more fashionable buildings, there is a lovely tree. Mr. Crockett has none until he goes to a shop to buy a sad little tree (reminiscent ofA Charlie BrownChristmas). For a year, he tends the tree carefully and pours out crumbs for the birds while neighbors look upon him with scorn and Christmas carolers pass by his house. However, as Mr. Crockett knows, ""beauty is as beauty does."" Adults will know the ending without my giving it away here. Children, I imagine, will enjoy the ending without seeing it coming."
1,Golf in England.,I presumed the book covered golf around the world. It doesn't. It wasso boring that I could not finish it.
5,Blessed,hey cristina....I find it really good that youve written this book its just so interested its the type of book that i canr eally say has impacted my life and touched my heart.....just like it will to tons of other young ladies....this is worth buying all the way..Its great to see how many lives you can impact with just writing one great amazing book....for the glory of God...
5,Definately a must have!,"This is an incredible song that enbodies the spirit and stamina of the World Cup! Every time I hear it it takes me back to my time spent in Germany while the World Cup was going on. The music video enhances the song, and it is too bad that in my part of the world they can't show it!"
5,Better than la copa de la vida..,"Maybe eclipsed by the so-called good song,The cup of the life ( la copa de la vida) by Ricky Martin, this songs proves to be the real theme of the World Cup, with exquisite arragments and overall..the quality; once again Dario G show us his talent, a MUST-TO- HAVE CD!!!!"
4,great product,"this product is extremely durable. with 3 little boys 5, 3, and 1 who are always climbing on top of it, it has yet to break. A little pricey but worth it if you have little ones that love thomas or any train!"
5,Thomas Train Table the best!!,My 2 year old grandson plays all day at his train. This was the best investment his grandfather and I could have made. A big plus are the drawers which even he can pull out over the rugs.
4,Really good CD,"If you are a fan of Only Theatre of Pain you should own this CD. The sound quality isn't perfect, but thats not the point. You can feel the energy in the music, and thats what counts."
1,These books...,"were written in a two week period of time, and boy does it show. There is little plot and absolutly no research was done on the subjects covered. They are obvious Harry Potter rip off and the author apparently hopes to use them to furthur her pro-christain stance. Pure drivel."
4,The author knows his stuff.,I had the unique pleasure of meeting the author at a seminar on this topic. His skill and perceptions are second to none. A great look into the mind of these individuals.
2,A dissenting review.,"After seeing all five star reviews of this book, I anticipated the work would be exceptional. I was sorely disappointed. While the author relates interesting tales of his encounters with homicidal individuals, his writing is on par with that of a college freshman. Don't expect well written sentences or precise use of psychiatric terminology. The book is in desperate need of professional editing. I suggest you shop around before spending your money on this one."
3,It was ok,I still can not get the bear to come out ok I always have to improvise to fix it when useing fo a customet but it is ok
5,Bear Cake Pan,I made this cake for my son's first birthday and let him have it all to himself. It was so cute to watch him decide what to do with it.
4,Very Impressed,"This set is huge. Looks great and works great, but the tongs are so large they darn near require 2 hands to operate and they are hard to grab onto some things with (hot dogs, potatoes, vegetables). Overall though this set is excellent."
5,Great product,"This is a great product, with an original shiny look, has lasted well so far (6 months on the floor of my garage). I also tested the remainder of the product in a few spots on the wood of my deck, to see how it would survive on outdoor applications. It also seems ok there, so I will probably try it again on the whole deck next spring.Now just a warning. Beware, the picture may be misleading. My original purchase was for 3 1-Qt cans, and I thought I was purchasing 3 1-gal bottles, based on the picture. Once I realized my mistake, I went back to the page I bought it from, and the title did mention it was for 1-Qt cans, and the seller had no control of the picture used in his ad. They did accept my return, however I lost the 2 shipping costs (purchase + return)."
5,Andrew Gatchell,"I bought this book after reading his book on the First Year. Organized in the same manner as the first, except divided into three month periods instead of one month, I found it again informative and funny. The information about temperaments was especially useful. We found books that became some of my daughter's favorites in the lists that he provides. Also, we are following Mr. Brott's advice about allowances and find that we are all learning. Now that my wife is pregnant again, I'm reading the Expectant Father and I expect I'll be re-reading the First Year and the Toddler Years books."
5,Easy read,I love this series of books because they read fast and are humorous. My husband enjoyed the first book so much I got him this second one and many times there were things that my parenting books did not have. He enjoyed the humor and the fact that you can pick up and put these books down any time.
4,A good read,I started reading the book after my child was well in his second year and it hit the nail on the head. The author has some good advice for caring for your child and planning for the future.
2,DADs NO HELP HERE,"To be honest, I didn't read the entire book since it was so general. I was hoping for a more personal view of the author's experiences but there weren't many. This book was a total compilation of other's views. I am tired of reading books on children. I don't want multiple references for multiple issues. I was hoping this was a dad who had real experiences to share with other dads. Unfortunately, this is another author trying to sell books. Do yourself a favor and buy 'What to Expect, The Toddler's Years' by Arlene Eisenburg. This is a reference we trust."
1,Avoid this book like the plague - it makes a TERRIBLE gift!!!!,"This is the second book I have received as a gift by this same author. Same cute cover (that I am sure led to the gift purchase), same insanely horrible content. Who on earth wants to be given a book about raising your toddler to flip through and find a chapter on the best strategies to get through a divorce (if the author actually took his own advice in the prior book, I have to assume the divorce information is from experience).Once again, the author wrote a book focused on his own self doubts and fears, and couched it as a healthy way to raise children.This is the second book I have ever stuck in the recycling bin instead of contributing to charity after reading it. No one on earth should be punished with this book."
2,"Nice design, poor running quality","Looks great on counter, but makes a lousy cup of coffee- carafe does not stay hot, steam builds up inside and it is prone to get moldy, and is awkward to pour......."
1,Beautiful but poorly built.,Do not buy this coffee maker. It is beautiful to look at but it does not function properly. The coffee pools up on the lid and spills out.
2,Dissapointing... Even when the performers are great singers/musicians!,"This CD is only for serious British Pop/Rock/Funk collectors... You know, the Brits always add their own 'spice' to this kind of music.The only superhit included here 'I've Been Thinkin' About You', is the easiest to recognize (and listen) 'Hit' in this album... The rest of songs fall from C- to E... or so. However the sound quality is very good..."
3,Flybar 800 review,"Great idea, but the Flybar is a bit slow on the recoil both for my son as well as for me. Springs have a faster recoil. But once you get used to it, it's not so bad. But it does appear to ""lumber"" around. Feels rather bulky. Next time I might try the Vertigo."
2,"Good stick, but parts wear out very quickly","Written as William's Son:Performance wise, this pogo stick works quite well, jumping to heights of about 3 - 4 feet. However, the pogo stick has some major problems:1. It makes much more noise than most people admit. It's loud.2.This is the major one. The thrusters on mine began to wear out in LESS THAN A MONTH. That's a month of 2 weeks frequent jumping and 2 weeks of unuse. THat's a problem. Another is the shock absorbers. They came out following the 2 weeks of unuse.The pogo stick worked well... until the parts started flying. Two point five stars."
1,Don't buy,"Purchased pogo stick as a Christmas gift. Received package CLEARLY showing what item was in box. You would think company would have some Discrition in packaging around holidays. But, that is not the worst of it. The pogo stick broke within 15 days of using. What a waste of money. I write company about my unhappiness not one person replied . Talk about terrible customer service and not even caring to make it right. Again, big waste don't spend your money. You don't get what you pay for."
2,Doesn't Jump That High,"I bought this thing so I could jump really high. I am about 165 lbs and I have it set to jump as high as it can go and it will only jump about 1 foot. There is no way you can get this thing to jump 4 foot in the air, it is not worth the money the the bar in the middle is really wide, it feels very funny riding on it."
3,Performance like promised but care for spares,The Flybar is a nice product and my son loves it.However after a few days of use the a shock pad fell of in piecesMy claim was received/confirmed and solved IMMEDIATELY;Two weeks later one out of eight thrusters gave upand I need to contact service again.Living in Germany makes things not easy when calling for help.juergen
5,coolest toy ever,"this pogo is bad to the bone,it is fully adjustable so if you do not want your kid to jump 4 feet high,you can set it where it doesnt.kids love it,even people driving down the street stop and give the thumbs up.its crazy!buy a helment!"
2,Broken in 2 weeks,"This is the 2nd Flybar product I have purchased for my son. The first one was the Super Pogo II, which has a poor design, the cotter pin kept breaking, the Flybar company were very helpful,they mailed us out replacement parts very quickly and without question. But it broke again and again, so we finally threw it out. Then we purchased this one, the 800! With the thick rubber bands, surely this design would be stronger, better? No. Out of the 8 rubber bands inside, 5 broke within days of each other. My son is well within the weight limit and I just don't have confidence in the Flybar Brand anymore. Won't buy another one!"
2,Fun but thrusters break easily,"My son saved his allowance and did extra work so that he could purchase this. When finally he saved enough, we ordered and he loved it immediately. It does bounce very high (but not scary high)and the ride seems smooth. He wanted me to write a very positive review the very next day so that everyone would know what a great product it was.However, within two days a thruster broke. We contacted the manufacturer who gladly replaced it with not only one thruster but TWELVE. Wow, I thought, how generous. It quickly became apparent why they sent so many out--they break very, VERY easily. At least six of ours have broken in less than a month. At this rate the life expectancy of this pogo stick is extremely limited, and we are very disappointed.This product is fun for a day, and then it starts to break. Not worth the $200."
4,Return of King Sun,King Sun returns with Strickly Ghetto and shows that he has still got his dope vocal skillz as well as his intelligent rhymes. King Sun's presence in the underground rap game today isn't exactly what it used to be in the late '80s/early '90s as skilled MC's get pushed aside these days to make way for little punks who can only rhyme about their b*tch *ss chains and the trife life they never lived. The EP still has bangin funky beats but also hardcore production now that gives this album an extra asset.
5,King Sun,"This is an excellent album. Love the old skool hip hop. I listen to at work and home, King Sun underrated artist."
3,"Music perfection, but beginners confusion","I purchased this book when I first began learning Bass. However I was to discover that it is not a book for beginners. It is very comprehensive, almost to fault. So much so that I would highly recommend it to a music student for deep study. However I still hardly use it and much prefer to refer to other, less confusing/comprehensive books."
3,lovelizziemcguire,i like this game its ok but the thing i do not like about it is that its a little stuped becase on one of thes things you have to do is brush her hair and the brush gos by to fast but the rest i like if you want more games go to gamestok thank you biy***@!!!
4,Life as a Tomato,"Rips paints a town of amazing, eccentric characters you long to get to know yourself. I found the words of the Philosopher of special interest. This Sutrian old-timer defines the tomato [and its concentrate] as being ""the perfect food for the traveler, who is, himself, in an indefinite or ambiguous state--separated from the place of departure but not yet attached to the place of arrival."" When I read the above passage, I did a double-take. I was on a plane drinking tomato juice, which I never order at a restaurant nor drink at home! Rips' are the kinds of stories you only gather by 'going native,' living in a foreign place long enough to really know it. By sharing his stories, Rips takes us with him."
2,I Can't Believe It's Not Fiction,"Rips is an entertaining writer but few words in this book ring true. A town of 5,000 people in Italy where all the old folks (and others) speak English and a foreigner who speaks no Italian gets the whole scoop and makes great friends in a few months?Truly unbelievable. The book started sounding made up with one of the first stories, about the beans--beans noted throughout Italy, by the way, as the only ones never to cause indigestion. By the end, it was total super realism. That said, Rips is an entertaining writer who should stick to fiction that's billed as such."
2,"Nice Stories: Disjointed, Sometimes Funny, Meandering","Read the rave reviews and then read the book yourself. Pasquale's Nose is a big disappointment and not tied together well, chapter to chapter. Michael Rips flits from subject to subject, character to character without developing anything enough to make you care and there is a rich seam of stories about the residents and history of Sutri to be told here. The book is unsatisfying and unfinished and attempts to be philisophical at the end with a discussion of Adam and Eve and the question ""Where Are You?"". Even so, I am glad I read the book because it opened up the village of Sutri, Italy -- and surrounding area -- for my further investigation. It whetted my appetite. I'll give Paquale's Nose that."
3,Good but not her best,"Vanessa Bell Armstrong is a talented Gospel singer with a beautiful voice. I purchased this CD as a used CD. This is the only one I didnt have. The story of Calvary and Father I stretch are by far the 2 best on this CD. I found Desire of my heart to be her best CD yet and I give that one 5 stars. This one is just ok, it didnt leave me uplifed like her other CD's do."
1,Misleading,"What I thought I was buying was a pen desk set, not just a replacement pen. The item was incredibly over-priced for a pen! This is third negative experience on recent Ebay purchases."
1,NO SCENT,NO SENT WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN THE PRICE IS HIGH FOR A BAR OF SOAP BUT THEY SHIPPED FINETHE PRODUCT IS NOT GOOD NOT THE SHIPPER
2,"Wonderful, simply but no HiFi !","Unbalanced frequency curve ending about 12-15kHz, insufficient output power of amplifiers, very often failure of relay and main cable."
5,From the intro,"From the publisher,""In Judge Dee's day, the literary world of Ancient China was one where intense study and almost ritualized scholarship were the rule, with academics and students alike dedicated to the highest concepts of beauty and art. But inwardly less exalted passions could erupt --to the point of murder. During a Mid-autumn Festival in Chin-hwa, Judge Dee is the fellow-guest of a small group of distinguished literati. Alas, he has little time for the criticism of couplets or calligraphy. A student has been murdered; a beautiful poetess is accused of whipping her maidservant to death; and further mysteries seem to lie in the eerie shadows of the Shrine of the Black Fox.""Another highly enjoyable Judge Dee mystery."
1,Not Compatible with Sony DCR - TRV480,"I ordered two of these batteries and paid for overnight shipping in that I needed them for a rapidly approaching event. When I put them in my Sony DCR-TRV480 camera and tried to charge them, the charge light started blinking after about 30 seconds. The manual stated this indicated the batteries are not compatible with the camera. I tried charging the battery overnight anyways, and the light never stopped blinking. When I tried to power up the camera, I had a message on the LCD saying Sony Info Li Ion Batteries, followed by the camera powering down. When I tried to determine the charge status of the battery, the camera would not provide the requested info. I believe the camera has some intelligence that looks for a chip on the battery to tell it it is a SONY battery. If not, it shuts the camera off. Hence, this battery is not compatible with the Sony DCR-TRV480 camera."
3,Not quite the real thing...,"This is an OEM version of the Matrox G450 AGP card, and is actually manufactured by Compaq, under agreement with Matrox.It's primary use is as a good, fast, 2D display card for people who need business graphics. It cannot compare to _any_ of thefast 3D cards available today, so gamers should rule this card out.Further, for home use, the OEM version of the card does not support TV-output, nor does it include the required cable thatwould allow the user to send DVD output to a television.The only standout features of this card are it's ability to display razor-sharp 2D graphics. Matrox is known for their highquality video output, and this card is one of their best in that regard. The card would shine when used with a video projectionunit, for displaying the screen output for training sessions, or sales presentations. Most Matrox cards are also very reliable,and should stay working for many years."
2,Gone in 60 seconds.,My Dachshund started to tear off the tennis ball type material within 60 seconds and within 10 minutes had to whole toy scalped.
4,A Must Have for Every Queen,"Amazingly, from a mediocre movie comes the soundtrack of the century. Well, at least the decade. ""Woop Woop"" offers the best in Gay sensibility--Classic Broadway Showtunes set to a dance beat. Without the Boy George track, it would be close to perfect. But ""I Can't Say NO"" is irresitable and the extended remix of ""Climb Every Mountain"" alone, makes it worth the price of admission. If you have even a mild appreciation for Camp, be you gay or straight, this is a must have. Throw it in the CD changer with some other party discs, set on shuffle and enjoy! And if you appreciate the campier approaches to Broadway, I also suggest ""Latin a la Lee,"" Broadway tunes to a africano-latino beat, sung by the fabulous Miss Peggy Lee."
4,You'll be AMAZED!,"Good LORD, a disco version of ""I Cain't Say No""! And I like it. Go figure.If you can handle a real mix of styles, you're gonna like this CD a lot. The AMG review is totally wrong. This disc is major F-U-N.Had me bouncing up and down in my chair at work.What led me to Woop Wop was searching for more stuff by Merrill Bainbridge, who appears here doing ""I Got You Babe"" in conjunction with Shaggy. Nice!The closing version of ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" is SO over the top. Outrageous. Love it.I may be just bit high here with 4 stars; after all, I just finished listening to this for the first time, but I'll tell ya - that was one helluva good first impression!"
2,Woop Woop CD was disappointing,"We really loved the movie and hoped the CD would be as good. It wasn't. There are about 3 good songs from the movie, but the rest is ordinary. Some of the actual show tunes used in the movie would have helped a great deal."
4,Awesome.,The only place in existance that has the Robin S Version of You'll never walk alone.The best drag number of all time.
3,Buy it buy it buy buy buy buy!,"I bought it for REEL BIG FISH's cover of ""There is nothing like a dame"". and for the Cake song (now you can have your cake and listen to it too). Buy it, you'll be impressed, as was I. PLus Reel Big FIsh really captured the energy of THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A DAME"
2,the first two tracks: A+,you hear the first two tracks and you think you have a real winner and then you hit Chumbawumba and then Boy George. Its ok if you skip chumba and Boy George
3,used for assignments,It did provide a summary of chapters and some focus questions.It helped to read it along with the story - NOT as a replacement.The original is more emotional and detailed.
2,What am I missing?,"Everyone else gave this 5 stars, I feel like I must be missing something, but this is the first Kindle book I gave up on. Yeah, 25% of the way in, I just couldn't take any more.It hit me that this is a soap opera script. Way too many characters. Everyone's life is in turmoil, and they will be brought together to re-live that tragic night when the beauty queen winner was disfigured.Somehow, I didn't care any more.Maybe, someday, I'll go back and finish it, just so I can tell you how it ends.But not now.My standards for a $.99 book aren't that high.This one wasn't for me. It's okay."
4,Enjoyable,"I read all sorts of books..this author writes good books with good story lines. If you are looking for a good read and something that holds your attention, I recommend this purchase...price was got my attention. The stories keep me coming back."
4,Night Hunter,"Another great book by Carol Davis Luce. Keeps you guessing,and I was way off base on this one. I didn't figure it out until the end."
3,"aaahhhh, a little toasty in here!","I liked it, since it has a bit of everything in it. I like a little sensuality in my novels along with a decent plot, and this one has both, so I liked it. Let's face it, it's not Shakespeare, but then again I didn't like reading him anyway."
5,"Strong worldbuilding, good writing","G'Feller's first book, ""No Sister of Mine"", shines as a well-constructed SF book with a lesbian protagonist. The author does not let the romance aspect overshadow the thrill and adventure of an SF story, yet the romance is integral to the story. G'Fellers manages to create an intense love story beneath a thrilling tale of culture clash, terror, and revenge. Even the villian is fascinating and terrifying.This is not a tale for the squeemish. Bad things happen in this tale, but it is by far one of the best in its genre and well-deserving of the 2006 Goldie award (SF category), finalist status for the Lambda Literary Foundation SF award, and nominated for a Gaylactic Spectrum Award."
5,In Light of Martinism-Best you can find,The book is an awesome biography of the Mystical life of Louise Claude de St. Martin. The author fully described the sequence of events of the life of this Unknown Philosopher. Excellent reference for the students in Martinism or traditional Martinist Order as well as a path in the search of Truth by modeling from the examples of the book.
4,Shadow Project InTuned Out live album,"An excellent live album, with cover's of Alice Cooper's ""Dead Babies"" and Bowie's ""Panic in Detroit"" as bonus tracks. This is the last live performance of the band, and highly recommeded."
4,Rozz At His Best,"There are so many live albums featuring Rozz Williams, but this is one of the best. It has great sound quality and it sounds raw at the same time. I never really liked their self titled debut, but the songs sound a lot better here. The album also contains two cool covers: Panic In Detroit by David Bowie and Dead Babies by Alice Cooper. I would have given this album a 5 if it contained Working On Beyond, Zaned People, Lord Of The Flies, and Red Handed. If you like this album you should also check out Iconologia by Christian Death."
2,I should have read the Amazon reviews first !,"You DON'T want to read this book if: you are sensitive, you avoid horror movies, you don't like to get depressed, you find the idea of a couple breeding babies to be freaks for their carnival by loading the mom up with drugs to be the least bit repulsive. Since I am in that list myself, I wish someone had warned me and advised me not to read this book. Better yet, I should have gone online to Amazon and read the reviews, and I would have known !I do agree with some of the reviewers' comments about the brilliance and creativity of the author, and I appreciated the subtle working of the theme of our culture's emphasis on physical appearance. However, I wish I hadn't read it."
4,I really like this book!,"This is one of my all time favorite books.I fell in love with Arturo, the freak. It was just very well-written. It draws you in and you fall in love and truly believe all of these over-the top, sideshow characters are real!"
4,Bizarre and Refreshing,"I don't know why, but it seems like every girl I meet has read and loves this book, yet most guys haven't even heard of it. I even had it recommended to me by a girlfriend. A crazy one. Like bi-polar, put my dog to sleep crazy. She was a sad mistake, but this book was not. I'm a big David Lynch fan, and this book is kind of the novelization form of a movie I could see him putting out. Strange characters, some malevolent, some vacuous, all marching to the beat of their own eccentric drum. Things go from strange, to even stranger, with mixes of everything from mutations to lobotomies thrown in, yet it all makes sense, in a sort of bizarre and twisted fashion. It eventually concludes as a weird, off the beaten path, but completely original tale. In my book, those are the best ones."
2,Disturbing,"Although I made a point of reading the reviews prior to purchasing this book, apparently I didn't clearly understand the content (subject matter). I was expecting humor, and received pathos. I anticipated an entertaining plot, and got a chaotic subculture that strained any logic or believability. I wanted to like the characters, or at least emphathize with them, and found only twisted and demented beings. I do give the author 5 stars on imagination and description. But would I recommend it? No."
2,For stronger stomachs than mine,"Other reviews use words like ""disturbing"" and ""grotesque"" to describe this novel. I read it during lunch and became physically ill (and it takes a lot to bother me). Imagine a cast of characters from a John Irving novel, and then ratchet up the deformities and depravities by ten, and you have ""Geek Love."""
4,abnormalcy made normal,"At first, the reader is disgusted with the experimentation of the Binewski family. Reading further, however, we begin to see the bigger picture. What could be better than subverting our own ideologies... taking our disgust with abnormalcy and gradually turning it into normalcy? Arturo snears at ""the ... norms."" That's great! For Arturo and Miss Lick both desire an inner concentration."
2,Very... different...,"I'll admit, I had to read this for school. Now, just so you know, this book is NOT about a nerdy kid in love with a preppy cheerleader or highschool athlete as the name implies. It is about Circus freaks. Before you say that isn't nice to say, they are proud. In this story, a Geek is someone who kills animals and drinks the blood in front of a crowd. I know, creepy. The plot is fairly hard to follow, but several twists abound. Knowing what it is about, I wouldn't pick it up again, but you can decide for yourself. It is a different twist on the American family/dream, but only you can decide if it is a good or bad different"
5,.,"What's with everyone hating the editing? I thought the book had great editing.I didn't find the characters too absurd or abstract to be unrealistic, but too absurd and abstract to be fictional. The transgressive themes of this book are all well and great and are attended to in other people's reviews, so I wont bother with one more attempt to praise it, but what I found most entertaining and refreshing are the characters in and of themselves. If you find them off-putting it's because you're one of them.This is emotional porn; exploitative to the point where the federal government would need to regulate it if it were imitated."
4,Geek Love,My daughter needed this book for her college English course and the bookstore there wanted almost double what I paid for it here! The book came in a timely manner and was exactly as described. Will definitely check here for her books first in the future.
1,Exploitive and manuipulative,I find it more disturbing that readers would find this enjoyable than that it was actually written. Experimentation of this type on people has been condemned by most thoughtful societies. To try to imply that parental affection has any role in the abusive treatment of the children is a travesty.
5,My #1 Recommended Book,"I recommend this book to all of my cool friends. And the ones who have had the guts to read it recommend it to their friends. Geek Love is a very unique story, and I saw it as one about what ""wierd"" really is. The story's narrator worries that she is ONLY an albino dwarf with a hump, and thus feels useless among her more ""freakish"" siblings. Sure, it's graphic, but not gratuitously gross. I was also impressed by the way Dunn showed how disconnected the family was from the ""real world"" by purposely not identifying the time period in which the novel is set."
4,Weird and freaky -- yet strangely compelling...,"Yuck. This book gave me the creeps, but it was so cool. A completely gross story, but, hey, it was original. The book is well-written and the story is well-told. Read it so that you can explain it to people at parties."
5,Addictive. Highly Recomended,"I was told to READ THIS BOOK by a very intelligent and very cool friend of mine. Okay sure, I thought. But she was right. K. Dunn weaves a story that is more than it seems. Each character is more than a unique indivual. Going beyond simple personality quirks and physical apperance this novel makes us see how we are all not norms, how we relate to our family, or freinds and the world we are thrown into. this book rawks."
4,"A strange tale, but then I like them like that.","What I foud most interesting about this book was not the story, but rather the writing style and the unusual vocabulary. From the first paragraph I found myself rereading certain phrases wondering what on earth they might mean. If you enjoy bizarre stories written about weird people in a strange language (as I do), then you're in for a great read!"
5,One of the finest pieces of originality ever written!,"I bought ""Geek Love"" kind of on a whim, and it turned out to be one of the 3 best novels I have ever read. Dunne's storytelling and plot are unlike any other ever written...graphic, disturbing, and truly amazing, but not for the close-minded or ignorant."
2,Dull,"Dunn has a fascinating premise here, but she drops the ball. Don't bother with this. The idea of challenging the conventional idea of normal is a good one, but Dunn fails to develop any of the characters here and so in the end, you really don't care."
3,Hooked but not happy,"It didn't take me long to get hooked into this book, but the entire time I was reading it I felt more like I was staring at a ghastly accident on the side of the road. There were a lot of characters that I loved to hate. I had a hard time liking anybody in this story. It was very sad and disturbing. I didn't get any insight from it and apperently I was suppose to. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone. I will say one good thing about it aside from not liking the story very much or the characters it was written very well and had a lot of imagination."
5,Extraordinary Beings Experiencing Ordinary Feelings,"This is the story of a carnival family who, in order to save the carnival, give birth to manufacured ""freaks"" by ingesting drugs and arsenic. It is the story of these ""freaks"" that is amazing, sad, horrifying and funny. I was repulsed when I first began reading this book, but became mesmerized with the turning of each page. I couldn't put this book down and I kept wondering how it would end. It takes a great imagination to write such a vivid book. Katherine Dunn has written a wonderful, horrific book that will disgust and horrify you as well as make you laugh out loud. The ""freaks"" in the story are wonderfully crafted and you feel for each of them. They are just extraordinary beings experiencing ordinary feelings of love, hate, anger and jealousy in an unusual setting. I would highly recommend this book for someone who is looking for something unusual to read and is willing to embrace the unexpected."
1,What is wrong with me?,"Everyone here and at rec.arts.books seems to love this book. I feel it had no redeeming value at all. It is without doubt the most worthless piece of crap that I have read in years. And you people who liked it worry me a little! 8) I know this is not the type of review wanted here, but it is more than this book merits."
1,Geek hate,This is the worst book I have ever read. I didn't even want it my house after reading it; a friend and I actually had a burning party to celebrate it's demise. I see no reason for the content. Ugly and horrifying.
2,Oh well.,"I am a college student who had to read this book for an contemporary American literature class. Geek Love is a very likeable book; Dunn features fascinating characters, intriguing dialogue, and events that will make you stop and think. The problem is this: the book is just not fun to read. This book is written for psuedo-intellectuals who have lots of time on their hands. Since I don't belong to this group, I found the book as exhiliarating as throwing myself at a wall of concrete. No, I never finished the book (I think I was at page 150 when the quiz hit), but it wasn't a disappointment to hear all the characters die at the end. Oh well. Bring on the next book."
2,I thought I was going to love this book ...,"but I didn't. I got the point, and I think the premise was ingenious, but it was such a wierd and twisted story about dull, self-indulgent, and mean-spirited characters (Oly excepted, mostly) that I just couldn't make myself care about it. I'm no stranger to either the wierd or twisted, but there just wasn't much to like in ""Geek Love"".Unlike my book group, which hated this book so much that not only didn't read it, they didn't even show up to complain about it (most unlike them), I found it compelling enough to finish. I kept hoping for a flash of wisdom or true beauty, but Dunn didn't deliver.Maybe my expectations were too high. I was sort of hoping that this would be another ""Ballad of the Sad Cafe"" and it so wasn't."
3,Big let down....,"This book was right up my alley.... freaks, geeks, carnies, and twisted people. I was enthralled with it from the beginning, shocked at the audacity of the writer to play the story out like she had, then somewhere about 2/3 into the book it seemed like she grew bored and just tied up the loose ends. I love the characters and will cherish the first half but it seems like Katherine did like Arturo's followers and just ""cut off"" too much."
3,That's it?,"I somehow managed to finish this book after about 2 months of making myself pick it up. It wasn't very interesting, it moved very slow, I could see the ""twists and turns"" coming from a mile away, and I almost threw the book across the room at the end. Stupid ending. I'm not a professional book reviewer so I don't have fancy words to describe it...so my average reader comments are ""bla, boring, would not suggest""."
2,"Interesting concept, poor execution","I have been recommended this book for the past several years and finally got around to reading it. Like others have stated, I did not really feel connected to the characters either because they were truly evil or because they had no spines, both had no real redeeming qualities. It was a very interesting concept but I thought the execution was flawed. I think this is a love it or hate book, plain and simple."
2,So Disturbing!,"This book was so disturbing! When I initially heard about this book, I was intrigued. A woman who takes drugs during her pregnancies in order to have ""freak"" children for their traveling carnival act. I did not know to what degree the author would go to show how twisted their family was. I wish that I could undo the reading of this book so that I didn't have the memories in my head!"
5,excellent,"Geek Love is a once in a lifetime book for sure. It is the story of the Binewskis, a carnival family who started from modest means and grew to a dangerous, cult like status. The characters are well developed and give good insight to an ""us against them"" mentality, only from the ""them"" point of view.This book is not necessarily for the faint of heart, but, if you enjoy an incredibly interesting and unique story you should get this book."
3,"Good read, if you can take it!","This one is very disturbing! Very well written, I can understand the award nominations, but hard to take if things like child abuse and incest gross you out. You definitely have to be prepared for the atrocities you read in this book."
3,Unreadably Grotesque,"Geek Love is a broken travesty of the very idea of the carnivalesque, a dark spot in the colorful tapestry of carnivalesque thought. Where there aught to be a myriad range of joy and color and chaotic freedom, there is the fantastic depravity of the Binewski carnival family. It is not for the feint of heart."
2,An oppressive reading experience,"I found this book oppressive -- there were times when I couldn't bring myself to pick it up, yet I couldn't abandon it. I have had this book for over 10 years and am not sure why I decided to read it now. I am so disappointed. It is not well-organized, the narrative bounces around too much, ALL of the characters are horrible and completely unlikeable. I have a feeling that it will be one of the books I always remember, so I cannot completely deny its power, but I do not think it deserves the praise it has gotten. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,This is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.,"I found this book to be the strangest, richest, most intriguing books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The characters jump off the page and as weird as they all are, they are somehow not only believable, but you feel bonded with them somehow at the end."
4,Great Premise,"Narrated by an albino humpbacked dwarf, Olympia Binewski, this novel is her reflection on the unusual life she led, raised by her eccentric circus owner parents who deliberately created deformed offspring. Oly recalls life with her flipper-finned brother Arturo, her Siamese twin sisters, her telekinetic brother Chick, and a revolving cast of bizarre characters who travel along with the circus. It was a great premise, I adored Chick, I felt sympathy for Oly and her motives, and I felt egomaniacal Arty made a great villain. The one thing that didn't work for me was Oly's present-day side plot. I didn't feel the writing was as engaging during the few chapters that were interspersed with the Binewski family narrative and the ending didn't deliver any satisfaction. Overall, though, the book contained great language and imagery and it provided an interesting commentary on what it is to be normal."
5,Geek Love,"This is definitely one of my all-time favorite books. Completely and wonderfully wacky, though and not for everyone. Think: ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues - on crack""."
5,Manipulative and magical,"I picked up this book not knowing anything about it, and I feel that's the best way to go about reading it. Dunn puts her craft to good use and seductively pulls her reader into the lives of a carnival freakshow family. Once your reality is suspended, Dunn presents you with unbelievable circumstances and disturbing images that hardly phase because you have become so wrapped up in her story-- it's too unreal not to be real. However, the book is not merely a trick of fancy-- her tale is compelling and speaks of the abnormalities of the world beyond the circus tent."
3,"Entertaining, but missing something...","I was very engrossed in this novel, was fascinated by the characters, was simultaneously appalled and intrigued by the excesses of Dunne's style, but when i reached the end, i was left wondering what it had all been building to. There was no satisfactory climax and the way the characters are dealt with at the end is very insufficient. A good climax or ending should build logically from the rest of the narrative, and the wrapping up of either half of the plot (either the flashback or the ""now"" sections) felt tacked on. Especially what ultimately becomes of Oly at the end seemed to me a cop-out. This is definitly not a book for everyone, but if you are merely looking for a fast paced read with no real depth (though Dunne and many of these reviewers seem to think it makes a profound statement on the human condition-- gag gag) i could reccomend this one."
2,Transgressiveness without any depth.,"I read somewhere that critics called this ""a collaboration between John Irving and David Lynch,"" but frankly, it doesn't have the depth of neither one of them. Transgressiveness is not bad if it provides some insight in to human nature but I had difficulty seeing what that was in this book."
2,I wanted to love it but just couldn't get into it,"So many told me to keep reading, that I would end up LOVING Geek Love. But I didn't. After a month of literally trudging through this book, I had to toss it aside. And I HATE not finishing a book."
2,"So close, and yet . . .","This is a very overwrought book, full of danger, deformity, deep secrets, and outright sibling war. Something strange, frightening, or disgusting happens to someone in every chapter - almost on every page - but the effect is unexpectedly flat. I was left with the feeling this book hadn't earned the emotional reaction it was trying for.I woul suggest _The Wasp Factory_ by Iain M. Banks instead. Using a smaller canvas, he paints a sharper picture."
5,One of my most referred books,I genuinely loved this book. It's frankness about a specific lifestyle is fascinating. I do not recommend reading it while you eat though.I've read it three times and find new interesting things to enjoy about it each time. It is the only book by Katherine Dunn that I would recommend though. I've tried some of her other books and can't get past the first few pages.
5,Read it!!!,This is the best book I ever read. Genius. Pure genius. Don't let the horror aspect throw you off; there are layers of meaning found in the horror. After all: who says it's horror? Norms.
5,Better than Anna Karenina!,"Tolstoy's classic is famous for its opening sentence about all unhappy families being different, and all happy ones being alike. Had Tolstoy still been around to read Geek Love, I'm not sure he would have felt that way. At its heart this is a simple story of a totally dysfunctional family -- our narrator, Olympia (a hunchbacked albino dwarf) spends much of the book musing on how relatively uninteresting she is, compared with her much more impressively carnivalistic family. Along the way Dunn deals with sibling rivalry, sexual violence, animal rights (including about the creepiest nurse/doctor character in all of literature), and -- best of all -- religious cultism. It's not a book for everyone; there are a handful of terribly ghastly moments in it. But overall, it's strongly written, incredibly poignant, and often hilarious. If I could take ten books onto a desert island, this would be one of them."
3,Very long book,This book was good but very very long. I became bored with it. Story could have been told in half the time. I skimmed thru most ofThe book.
4,Talk about freaky-deaky!,"A couple who work in the carnival deliberately has a clutch of children, all deformed circus freaks. Geek Love is populated by a dark and wild bunch of characters, written with a wry style that explores our culture's standard of beauty and what's okay."
4,Interseting Yet Very Twisted,"This book was really interesting. Although it was twisted and at times almost disgustingly horrifiying, I really enjoyed the book. It had a good view point on how people judge and percieve others. I thought it was fasinatingly gross. Check out this book. It was very neat."
2,"Dunn before, Dunn better","It's pretty easy to see what Katherine Dunn is trying to do here, but unfortunately she doesn't make it. Any one of the themes ""explored"" in this wannabe shocker can be better appreciated in other sources -- for example, John Irving's _The World According to Garp_ , or any of the early John Waters films. Both Irving and Waters treat their subject matter with a sensitivity and compassion than seems greatly lacking in _Geek Love_, with the result that this novel ends up affecting your stomach more than your heart. The only thing that kept me from giving it just one star is the occasional witticism from Arturo, who uses scatalogical and anatomical epithets in a clever way. Otherwise, it's just pornography, which I guess is okay if that's what you're looking for -- though I prefer my porn straight, without the pseudo-philosophical trappings."
4,THIS STORY IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED!!!!!!!,"Al and Lily decide to breed their own freak show. Lily intentionally uses illegal drugs, insecticides during her pregnancies, and after several failed attempts (which are on display in the carnival's museum, floating in formaldehyde, their deformities revealed in all their grotesque glory), she has four successes:Arturo (""The Aqua Boy""), a head and torso with flippers instead of arms and legs;Iphigenia and Electra, beautiful twins who share a common set of legs;Olympia, a bald, hunch-backed albino dwarf;Chick, who looks like a ""norm"" on the outside but has psychic powers that are both handy and disasterous for the Binewski family.The Author has concocted a startling stew of twisted values, sexual urgency, horror, wonderment, shock, awe and destruction. This book isn't for the faint hearted.There's beauty in the ugliness of it, and ugliness in the beauty of it."
1,In Bad Taste,"I had to read this book for an English Lit course and I really had a very hard time finishing it. I must be pretty abnormal since most reviews were good. I found the content very disturbing. For someone's mind to come up with such horrific actions which I feel are immoral as well as sick must have a twisted outlook on life. I really couldn't see the author's point. The ending was a pretty common ending to murder, incest and drug taking. There are so many wonderful literary books out there, I can't understand why a Professor would recommend this book."
1,Sick and Twisted,I should have read why some of the reviewers rated this book a one before I read it. This book just did not do it for me. I could not get past the sick mind of Arturo and cult-like following of his family and other characters in the book. A Great Disappointment!!!
2,Circus Life And Make Believe,The book is a slow read only because it is full of so much detail mainly about the characters. I am about half way through and it is reminiscent of Water for Elephants so far. Well I have now finished and let me just say this is the weirdest book I have ever read. It is so unbelievable in parts it makes the story difficult to read. Its saving grace is that it is totally unlike anything else out there. It took some type of imagination to conjure this up. I would not read it again and cannot see how it was a National Book Award finalist.
1,Wish I could give it fewer than one star.,"After reading all of the rave reviews of this book, I was excited to finally get my hands on it. What little of it I was able to read was boring. The writing was disjointed, the story confusing, and the characters thoroughly unlikeable."
2,You either love it or hate it. I HATED this book,"I couldn't figure out the point. It grossed me out. It's morbid. I slogged through it because it came highly recommended. I had to force myself to finish this book. If you are interested in freaks, read Angela Carter. I could at least see the point in her books. I hated Geek Love. I kept asking myself Why?"
5,Disturbing but riveting,"Al and Lil Binewski own a failing carnival, which they revive by creating a family of freaks though chemical abuse during pregnancy. Not just standard drugs, but pesticides, radioisotopes, and more. The story is narrated by their daughter Olympia, a bald albino hunchback dwarf, who often bemoans her relative normalcy (you should see her siblings). It's a fascinating look at not only carnival life, but how we view physical beauty in general. Do we really envy those who are completely normal, or those who proudly display their differences? The description is raw, shocking, and painfully vivid, but like a carnival freak show, you just can't look away. You have to keep reading, to get a better look, to see what they'll do next. This is not the sort of book that will appeal to everyone, or even most people, but I really enjoyed it. If nothing else, it was very different from most other things I've read."
3,A Study for the Bold,"I haven't actually finished this book, but this is my second attempt. My first, when I was 16, was shadowed by a sense of wrongness, as I'm sure many people have experienced. I still pale at some of the things that happen. But my cringe is the result, now, of the feelings of disgust that swim around this novel, not for the characters or what happens. To explain why, I took a class last semester about the history of carnival and sideshow and more importantly the people considered freakish enough to be a part of them. Instead of being turned off by the characters, bizarre as they may be, it is the reaction of the ""norms"" that make me want to cry. Hate is obvious in this book, and it is the hate which we should see in the words and learn from Dunn's writing that we do not want to be the ones to hate ""others"". Its a difficult book with a bold lesson for those ready to face it."
4,Underrated Hidden Genius!,"In the highly saturated realm of fiction, this book is a refreshing and welcome change from cliche storylines. With her satirically presented view of ""family values"" and the deeper resentments of sibling and parent/child relations, Ms. Dunn has singlehandedly addressed the taboo of dysfunction from the perspective of those already looked upon as freaks. Even in the occasional slower parts of the book, the anticipation of ""what could possibly happen next?"" holds you to turning the pages. Try it!"
4,Wacka-doo cool!,"I saw this book in a store, thought the title looked funny and flipped it over to see what it was about. I had never heard of the author. Well, I thought it sounded like a fascinating story, so I bought it. The beginning is a little slow and confusing, but I will say this: persevere and you will be rewarded! The middle section of this book is the best! Reading about all these ""freaks"", who still have human thoughts and feelings, it is both unsettling and nice at the same time. The ending was too abrupt, but all in all, a very different, interesting read. I dare somebody to make it into a movie!"
5,a joy,This book is perfect if you are looking for a purely theoretical treatment of the subject. Its a great reference and I admire the author for taking his time to write such a wonderful book.
4,My review,"Dong-Mei also known as Grace Parker, was left on the steps of an orphanage in China. Luckily, a kind family in Canada was looking for another child to add in their family and decided to look for one but it wasn't easy. Lots of orphanages didn't accept the Parkers offer as supposedly, a family couldn't adopt a child if they already have one. When the Parkers finally located the orphanage in China, after lots of paperwork and tons of time, a picture of the baby girl they were adopting was sent to Canada. As Grace adapted to her family in Canada, she always hated the thought of her birth mother. How she had abandoned her, but as she thought of it more and more, she wanted to meet her mother to figure out why.Thus Grace begins her long journey in her teen years across the world to locate her mother. A quest that takes her to China but what she discovers will change her life forever."
2,Poorly written for the layperson and the enthusiast alike.,"The author jumps around and changes subjects too much. He starts an explanation, then stops halfway through and says he's saving it for the next chapter. His analogies are absolutely terrible. He is pushing a theoretical agenda, so don't read this book if you're looking for just a simple, straightforward explanation of string theory. I understood most of what he had to say only because I had previous knowledge of string theory."
4,The Cosmic Landscape,"Great book! Susskind describes ultimate reality as ""a landscape of possibilities populated by a megaverse of actualities."" (p. 347) John Haught on the other hand, professor of theology at Georgetown Universtiy, describes deity as ""the repository of all possibilities.""Susskind rightly I think dismisses the redundancy of an external architect or designer in a universe already replete with intelligence. My only quibble with the book, if it can be called that, is my impression that deity by any other name is still deity."
2,Overly speculative,"As far as we know, there is still only one universe that we can observe by our instruments. What is the evidence for the supposedly 10^500 other universes that we cannot observe? Hint: they are unobservable.The landscape problem was a by-product of the Super String Theory that was unable to make consistent predictions about our universe. Perhaps it is not so super after all. Susskind should delay publications claiming unobservable worlds until there are evidence of just observing one other universe that is not of our own. If there are indeed 10^500 worlds around, that should not be so difficult."
4,Good read.,Better than some of the others covering the same subject. String theory was by far the best part. Recommend for those interested in physics.
3,Too speculative albeit beautiful,"Indulges too much in conjectures which by their nature cannot be proved either true or false. Said that, the ideas are beautiful and the book reads as a novel"
4,Don Winston's Review,"An excellent discussion of the current state of ""theoretical"" physics and cosmology. He comes darn close to asserting the mathematical models inspired by string theory are evidence all by themselves that they are true. This gives me the creeps. The concepts he discusses are accessible to most educated intelligent people and are not dumbed down too much."
1,Not worth your time,This book is so poorly written and illustrated that I had difficulty not just giving up. Apparently it was never seen by an editor. The text is rambling and not clear. The illustrations are mostly so simple as to not convey any information. As far as I can tell his premise supporting the anthropic principle is just silly. While he is a well known physicist he engages in a lot of name dropping in an apparent attempt to enhance his importance.
4,Good reading but not for anybody,"An interesting book. One of the very creators of String Theory trying to explain it for the educated general reader. Not an easy reading, you should have had a fairly good hard science education to successfully wade through its almost 400 pages. Still, considering the alternative... (that is, actually learning the math involved). :)"
3,Susskind on Intelligent Cosmological Design,"Let me make one thing clear, Susskind is an accomplished founder of String Theory and a clear thinker. What he is not is a gifted writer. This book is dry and more of an introduction to String Theory and related concepts rather than a defense on why he believes Intelligent Design via the Anthropic Principle fails (which gets minimum air time). Susskind is those type of thinkers who come off much better orally than written. Even more strangely there is no select bibliography for better research into these questions. For an intro into String Theory this is a good start, for an intro into the debates over the Anthropic Principle and an intelligent designer you would do much better looking elsewhere."
2,Looks better than it works,"If you need a paper weight that looks like a cork screw, this is for you. Otherwise, it didn't work too well [for me] as a wine opener and I had to use force to get the cork out. My OXO opener, at half the price, does a better job and is much easier on the hands. The Anolon Corkscrew looks nice, however!"
3,Unremarkable,"I just finished running this campaign, and my group did have some fun with it. However, some of the negatives are fairly noticable. My largest complaint was the railroading nature of the plot, with the campaign heavy-handedly forcing the PCs along a set path. Secondly, the artwork is terrible. Not so much in its quality, as in its inaccuracy. It was rare when the pictures of NPCs matched up to thier written descriptions. Several of the seneraios are unimaginative and bland (This is partcularly true towards the end of the campaign.)Some of the positive aspect of the campaign consist of its action elements. Fitting perfectly with the feel of d20 CoC, the PCs will be doing more than thier fair share of fighting. So if your looking for a high-action CoC game, this is the campiagn to get. Also, some of the early senarios are rather interesting and fun (The 3rd chapter is my favorite)."
1,DREADFUL,"IF Spears spent as much time working on her voice as she did working her tart image, she could be an average singer. As it is she does remakes of great songs. Lucky for her she has terrific bands to back her up and drown out her voice."
1,Is Britney dressed to meet Rock Space Aliens?,The cover says it all. She'd better retire now that she has only her laurels (and a G-string) to sit on.
1,Play it in IRAQ!!,"The war would be over in minutes. But then the international community would accuse all Americans of cruel and unusual torture. Spears obviously thinks we're all deaf and her image is all she needs to sell her junk. Speaking of her image, she should just put a jailhouse number across her chest and she'll look like any other nightwalker in central lockup."
1,Time to RETIREEEEEEE BRITNEY,And it can't happen any too soon.The losers on this site actually have time to write so many words about Britney Spears?????She ain't worth the print
2,I prefer singers with talent-by Joel,"Sometimes I'm wondering why she is(was)sucsesful,when the talent,and the property are missing.The only thing she knows to do is to pose around for the cameras(and she's ugly,too)and enervate us(this one is the thing she does better of all!!!)These are good pop singers:Kylie MinogueKelly OsbourneChristina AguileraMadonna etc..."
1,All about the press!,"britney spears is all about one thing: media hype! The reason she is still around is because of her stupid marriage & now that she's pregnant that'll give her another excuse to be on more magazine covers & get more attention. She's all about her personal life & the foolish things she does in it. She's not about music, she's not an artist. Everything she did, Janet & Madonna had already done a decade ago. She just rips them off! britney will never be the popular pop mega star she used to be. She's too much of a media joke, that's why her GH did so poorly. It barely sold a million copies here in the states. Maybe she's better off just being a wife & mother & leaving music to people who can actually sing."
2,"Sad Re-Make of ""My Prerogative""","Britney should have left it at re-releasing her former ""Hits."" But to touch Bobby Brown's ""My Prerogative,"" and to do it with Britney's voice, it just doesn't come close to good. The ""hits"" are few and far between with some from her teenie days when she actually had a career. If Britney wants to get back in the lights she better find lesser songs so she doesnt' get compared with REAL singers."
4,Videos,"If you are a big britney fan. You can take two routes. You be responsible and buy this so the artist can make money or you can go on youtube and watch the videos on their. I say this because on this dvd it has all of her singles on here starting from ""hit me baby one more time"" to My Prerogative' but it does not have Do Something or her current singles on Blackout"
4,Satisfied,"I honestly bought this spontantously, because it was for someones gift. They loved it because it has every single music video Britney Spears has every made, and they now don't have to go youtube for all the songs anymore."
5,Say What You Want About Britney....,"but the girl has definitely made an impact on pop culture. Is she a talented singer? No. Is she a talented performer? Maybe. Has she made some good music videos? Heck yeah. The songs are catchy to the ears *if you like pop music* and the videos are catchy to the eye whether we're talking about the clever Catholic school girl concept of ""Baby One More Time"", the sexy dance romp of ""Crazy"" or the sexy flight attendant of ""Toxic."" These videos are fun to watch and its nice to see all of them avaliable on DVD. It's nice to see ""Born To Make You Happy"" on the list since the USA didn't get that one. We got the equally pleasant ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" *which had a really sweet video to it....back when Brit was America's innocent lil teenage girl....oh how times have changed.*Essential to Britney fans....although I cringe to think how many gross old men are going to buy this for their own reasons....LOL!"
5,The Best Britney DVD ever,"I think this is the best dvd she put out, I used my multi angle feature for the first time, it's great to see different sides of Britney."
1,Cut the MUSIC and what do you have,"An Ashlee Simpson before she existed. Britney Spears is incapable of singing a lick. That's why you get the attitude, personna, or whatever the heck you call the Madonna styled 'tude. Although Madonna can't sing either, she had the ability to hold a crowd because she at least made an effort. This one isn't even trying!"
1,Voted one of 5 WORSE songs in 2005 on VH1,"Probably since she only whines through the whole thing in baby-talk and does it to a car and in bed. True Britney Spears. To write anymore about her ""talent"" is giving her too much credit"
1,Sad decline of American Music,"Yeah, you listen to her music and her voice while watching her Video. It doesn't surprise me that most reviewers talk about everything else but her voice. It's the only thing that can't be re-done with silicone."
1,BRITNEY HITS THE SKIDS,"Like, she's been on a downward slide ever since she opened her mouth to sing. Mind you she can DANCE. But SING?????? Like Madonna she has the best promo team in the world but Britney is at least pretty. Problem is, Britney is not an original (neither is her bod). From the looks of the cover she's pretty darned mad she was turned down for Victoria's Secret."
1,"Now a Woman, Never a Singer","Britney isn't even trying.....""Greatest Hits???"" Mostly from her Mickey Mouse years when she was still cute. Now that she's a woman and competitive with the other women who can actually Sing she should know her limitations."
3,WHAT?,You get all her videos and THEY ARE NOT IN 5.1 SURROUND SOUND?Did they modify the videos to be fullscreen and not in the original way the director wanted it to be? This is a huge disappointment. I have waited so long for all of Britney's videos (in their original format) to be on DVD with 5.1 Surround Sound and Digital Enhancement. I guess that dream will never come true...:( BMG is gonna hear about this...
2,"Old hits okay, Can't stand My Perogative","Nice compilation of older stuff, when Britney was still a kid and the music was good. Then she started taking herself seriously and thought she could write!!!! Yeah, like she can act. Spears star is fading as fast as her clothes."
1,Unfit for children of any age,"Please don't buy this CD for your kids. I am a proud, active mother of twin daughters (11 y/o). Today I spent a few hours explaining why they shouldn't dance or dress like Britney. This was precipitated by my watching my daughters plan to make ""britney"" costumes and dance like ""Toxic"" for the neighborhood kids. From now on, I'll be sure to avoid talentless, media-contrived, divas that stay in the headlines for wearings nearly nothing and contributing less."
1,Britney Spears and RAP,"The two areas of music that single-handedly are taking the music industry down. Yes, Spears has her own category. She started the sleaze craze and of course he had to...because she never had a voice. Madonna and Spears....what a team!! Of course Madonna was the best suited person to be on a CD with Spears since neither can sing a lick. I notice that most reviews here get very sexual in their writings. It's simply that Spears made that cleap slut category all her own. It's time to retire her G-string and take it where it belongs. To her hometown in New Orleans (I hear they don't want her either.....she cheapens up the place). Oh well, I couldn't write about her singing because she can't sing."
1,Just a Pop Tart,"That's all Britney ever was and where her talent always laid. She really knows how to tart up a stage. As for the salivating sad juveniles here (or is it her family that's posting all the rave reviews?), her lagging album sales tell the truth. Just like her Idol, Madonna, this woman can't sing a Lick! Just a cheesy T&A routine that's getting as old as her waistline. I saw her in New Orleans and she's getting pretty flabby. Too much partying in Las Vegas!"
1,Greatest Hits? Hardly. Over? Completely!,Thank god Britney is over. This was the last piece of garbage she released. She's old and fat now. Goodbye Debbie Gibson without the talent!
1,"Can't Touch ""My Prerogative""","Too bad Britney Spears is actually touching songs made by her betters. Her version of ""My Prerogative"" is so badly done I just turn down the volume when it's played which thankfully isn't very often. Now we get ""Greatest Hits,"" lots of her earlier stuff and very few hits. (See, I can cut and paste too).

1,The Backup Bands should be paid more!,They have all the talent especially when they do such a great job of drowning Britney Spears voice out while giving us such great dance music. Spears should be paying US to listen to this garbage.
1,Just like Madonna,"Yeah, Britney Spears is ""talented."" Just like her idol, Madonna, the patron saint of mediocrities, Spears can't sing a lick. If she kept her clothes on, didn't dance with snakes, and didn't have tremendous bands to drown her out, she'd be the Tiny Tim of the 2000's. Never heard of Tiny Tim?? Checkmate."
1,Move your old body out of the way Britney,"She's old and dried out at the ripe old age of 24. Other better and prettier female singers are out now and they can SING. Just what is that outfit she's not wearing on the cover??? omg, she looks as stupid as she is."
1,Down for the Count,"Looks like Britney isn't even trying anymore. Too bad. Her music is tanking and her version of My Prerogative is being panned on everything from ""E!"" to VH1. Does she really have fans left??????"
1,BRITNEY'S A LOSER,"Too bad she never could sing. She KNOWS she's only got a couple more years before her best assets (and what excites the people here) go south to stay. Yes, it's a fact of nature boys. Oh yeah, it would be great if you were old enough to learn how to spell. It's ""goddess"" and ""when"". If you're serious about the words, learn how to spell them."
1,Can I give it a MINUS Ten???,My boyfriend and I were Brit fans when we were kids. Then we got old enough to get drivers licenses and developed music taste. Britney is fading fast and remaking a terrific song shows desperation. Bobby Brown's song has got the great beats and it's wonderful dance music. Too bad Brit is getting so bad that the only headlines she can get is by marrying again and again. Too bad for Brit that there's so many younger singers coming up and THEY can sing!
1,MY Prerogative,"Is to leave Britney's junk on the shelves. I'm from Kentwood LA too, haven't we suffered enough?!? I used to like Britney Spears, then the pimples disappeared and I started to hear better. EEEch, this is one untalented woman."
1,THE WORST DVD EVER IN A HUNDRED YEARS,"IT'S BRITNEY SO IT IS AWFUL,VAPID,PUNGENT,REVOLTING,TERRIBLE AND YUCKY.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY HAVE THIS DISGRACEFUL BRITNEY DVD YOU SHOULD BE SLAPPED.A TRUE MUSIC FAN WOULD AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.GET ANY DVD FROM QUEEN INSTEAD.ZERO STARS."
4,Good!,Large staff. Easy to read and encouraging to play. Great tool for beginner. Looking forward to the upcoming CD. Would be perfect with it!
2,Bass instead of bass guitar,"My mistake in purchasing this one, sorry :( but it was put to good use :). It was given to a teacher for her students to use for their lessons. thanks"
3,Review of Three Little Kittens,"The book was more worn than I expected. However, I realize that it has been around for quite a while."
3,Not The One To Buy,"Ignore the 5 star reviews that everyone is giving this CD. Yes, the songs are great, in true Stone Roses fashion. But all these songs are now available on the 1995 Silvertone release The Complete Stone Roses, which also contains all 7 singles from their debut album plus a few other tracks that are not on Turns Into Stone. ""Complete"" has 21 tracks in all, versus only 11 here and the price is the same. Need I say more? Silvertone should have retired this one a long time ago."
5,Magnificence,"As far as I'm concerned, Turns Into Stone ranks up there with The Stone Roses. With such beautiful gems as ""Going Down"", ""Mersey Paradise"", ""Where Angels Play"", and ""What the World is Waiting For"", the dream state this album transports you to is beyond words..."
2,"Boring, zzzzzzzz","The first time I played this game, it seemed pretty cool, but the longer I played the more I realized that the interface was no good, there is no way to control all of your guys at once, you have to go to their positions to give orders, basically if they are under attack, they're dead by the time you get there.Another thing is that the skirmish mode stinks, there are only 5 maps and you can't choose what race you want to be for each map. Plus, on some maps, the AI is completely stupid, and on some it is just the opposite. This game is just plain boring, it gets on your nerves a lot. If you like strategy, stay away from this game, get Red Alert 2 instead."
2,How do you play it?,"Ok, by reading the reviews of the people here, I can see someone has figured this game out. I bought it not realizing it had missions where you had to do certian thing at certain times. I thought this was going to more of a graphics rich version of Dune 2000 or Tiberian Sun...was I dissapointed.It takes forever just to get to play a mission. The mission starts loading up and someone starts talking, I guess giving a little story to the mission you are about to play. But, I can see that it's all loaded up within a few seconds, but the person just keeps talking. I can't get it to skip past that so I can go ahead a play. This is very frustrating. In a nutshell, I stopped trying to figure it out and went on to buy another game to play. Get something else, this sucks."
4,Fun and fast paced,"I noticed a previous reviewer said you really need a fast system to play BZ2. Well I am playing on a 300mhz pent2, 160 megs ram, Voodoo3 3000, and with a 40kbs internet connection speed and it is smooth as silk with every feature turned up and using 800X600 res. He must have alot of stuff running in the background. Well enough of that. The single player game has great graphics and good strategy gameplay. I find the storyline a bit weak though. The multiplayer portion needs some work. Ping times are extremely high and it is hard to get into a low(sub 400) ping room. They really need to fix that portion. While I am not quite as impressed as with the first, BZ2 is still a good game to keep you glued to your monitor for hours."
5,recomend to everyone!,everyone should read this book! simply one of the best books ever. this is one of the only books i actually read in school. i even read ahead!
3,Your average Christie novel,"I recently played a computer game based on this book. I was quite surprised by the ending, however, as it was different from the computer game and much more inventive."
3,Decent mystery book,"Decent mystery book. Didn't have a chance to get into it fully as quickly as I would have liked, and it seemed to match something that I would find on any run of the mill television series which might have been my problem. Regardless, it conveyed a well written personal touch of each of the characters, and drew me into the story enough to lament their respective deaths, which is really the goal of the book anyway"
5,Agatha Christie's,"Ten people are invited for a weekend getaway on an island, unknowingly that their lifes would end in just a few days. One by one, each person is killed in a way that relates to a poem that is hanging in the hotel entitled ""Ten Little Indians"" (which used to be the former title of this book), that hangs next to ten porcelain indians. As each person dies, one indian breaks. This story will keep you guessing who the murderer is until you finish the book. Beware it may not be who you think! I hope this review helps you pick out a great book to read as the seasons change, and more people stay inside around the fireplace, and cuddle with a good book. This is that one book that needs to sit by the fireplace with you!"
5,A Great Read,"When someone suggested this book to me as Ten Little Indians, I couldn't find it. I'm glad one of my friend did find it because its a great book to read. It is suspenseful and I like the way everything came together in the end. I really enjoyed this book."
2,didn't capture my interest,"i chose this as my first time to try reading a mystery book. the plot seemed cool to me. but reading it, i didn't find the reading pleasurable. the story is rather simple, and its setting is in england so the writing is all ""british."" as we all know, americans and the british talk very differently. in addition, it's set in an earlier time, where they talked in a fancy, rather annoying way. perhaps this is a good book, but i lost my interest after a short number of pages. i'd rather read a newer american mystery novel. just a warning that while even if this book is great, it isn't for everyone."
2,Knibb High Football Rules!,I thought this book was really boring. It kept saying the same things over and over. The same situations were played over and over. I didnt like it very much and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone.
2,An OK book,This book was good once you got to the end but it dragged on way too much. It is very confusing and hard to get into because no action happens well in to the book. I would most likely not recomend this book to any one unless you have alot of patience.
2,Okay until the end!,"i read this book because my aunt and cousin both liked Agatha Christie mysteries. i ordered this book without telling either of them. when i got the book, i told them both that i had gotten it. they both said that it was good until the ending. well i read the book anyway, just to see what i thought of it. i was enjoying it very much and if i never had finished it, i would have given it a five star review. unfortunately, i did finish it. i, like my aunt and cousin, HATED the end of the book. i would have liked it if the story hadn't had a bad ending. while i recomend this book to someone who likes bad endings, if you like a nice, happy ending STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I HATE BAD ENDINGS."
1,Not All of That,I'm not sure why this book is so highly rated but I'm mad I wasted my time reading it. It was written well. It was a page turner but it was drawn out and had a very anticlimactic ending. So not worth my time or money.
3,It is a thriller,The killer is Lawrence Wargrave ok so if you have to read this in school and you have a question like who do you predict it is Lawrence Wargrave.
4,And Then There Were None,Fantastic story. This is the one that started it all for me -- my love of Agatha Christie. Since then I've read nearly all her books. The complaints about Christie's characters being two dimensional and surprise evidence near the end of the story don't seem that obvious here.10 Little Indians
5,A MASTERPIECE OF MYSTERY STORYTELLING,"Agatha Christie is the master of the mystery novel. Period. There is no question in my mind that she is the epitome of what mystery storytelling is about.'And Then There Were None' is, I believe, her all time greatest novel. Though with well over 70 novels in print, it is hard to read them all. I love the way her charectors develope in this novel, in the short time they inhabit Indian Island.The premis is simple. Ten strangers sent to an island for a luxorious get away. Mysteriously, however, one by one, they all begin to disapear...who did it? You'll have to read this wonderful novel to find out!Five out of Five"
5,One of the greatest mysteries of all time!,"All I can say is wow. This is such a great book. Ten people who are all complete strangers are invited out to an isolated island for a vacation. When the host doesn't show up and people start dropping like flies, you start to really get into the book. This is one that you won't want to put down. It involves several mysteries, including who is the murderer, who will die next and the mysterious past of the characters. This is definately one of the best Agatha Christie books. Also, (take it from me because I'm a kid) it's great for kids and adults. You gotta read this one!"
4,"This edition tries (and fails) to be ""PC""","I have long loved Agatha Christie's work and I've read ""And Then There Were None"" several times (I teach the novel in a high school). My only issue with this particular edition is that, in an attempt to be politically correct, the publishers chose to change the name of the island from Indian Island to Soldier Island. This would be alright except that they left in all of the anti-semitic rhetoric (with regards to Isaac Morris) and racist comments about African natives. If you're going to go PC, then do it completely or not at all. Or better yet, educate people about the changes in attitudes from one time period to another and read it in that context."
5,"If you want to be scared, read this deadly mystery.","Agatha Christie does a great job (of course!) on writing a scary mystery story. Most of her other books do not keep you on the edge of your seat as this book did. ""And Then There Were None"" is about ten people who have all committed murders. They are invited to Indian Island by an unkown person. They are trapped on the island and they start dying one by one. The murders follow the nursery rhyme ""Ten Little Indians."" I waited in suspense to find out who was the killer, and I was surprised at who it was and why the person did it. I think everyone should read this book, even school children. It uses so many different literary techniques, such as foreshadowing. This is one of the best books I have read this year."
5,The book that made me fall in love with Agatha Christie.,"What can I say? The first Agatha Christie I ever read, and I've read over forty of her books since. None of them, however (nor any other book), has ever replaced it as my unquestioned favorite. Great characters (the dense Mr. Blore was my favorite), a brilliant plot (every character is a suspect, murderer, AND a victim!), and a chilling, suspenseful atmosphere. If you HAVE to see one of the movie versions, see the 1945 film starring Walter Huston, Roland Young, and Richard Haydn.Although it (and all other film versions) stupidly alters the original novel ending (yes, I know Agatha herself changed it for the stage), it still contains plenty of atmosphere and hilarious dark humor."
5,The Greatest Book!,"The book really captured my interest! The suspense of Agatha Christie's work was really intriguing. As a story of 10 people who come to a deserted island to meet their fate, they really do fall."
5,Intense and Suspenseful,"""And Then There Were None"" is an amazing story. I was glued to the book once I got into the full swing of it. The flow of the book keeps you riveted to the very last page. Agatha Christie wrote it in a manner that gets you to try to figure it out along with the people left. As the amount of survivors dwindles, the suspicion arises and overcomes rational thought. Panic takes over and everyone is watching out for themselves no matter the cost to anyone else. This shows the break down of a rational, sane individual into a crazed murderer bent on attaining his own level of justice. It also portrays the actions and thoughts that remain once panic and fear become the forefront of your mind. All in all, its an amazing book that will keep you on the edge of your seat til the very end."
5,AMAZING!,This is by far the best mystery ive ever read. I couldnt put it down and finished it in 2 days!
3,and then,"quite a story-10 people brought together to receive the ""wages of sin"" Agatha keeps the reader guessing.The folks are lured with a promise of aweekend of luxurious weekend. Then they begin to dieTraps, twists and turns make this a good read"
5,Definitly the best murder mystery every written.,"What can I say? There is no other book that I've read (and let me tell you, I've read quite a few) that completely baffled me the way this one did. Not only is the real culprit a mastermind, but Christie is as well."
5,ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL THRILLERS WRITTEN EVER!,"The best you can expect from a thriller novel. A TIMEBOMB! A MUST READ NOVEL FOR ALL THRILLER-LOVERS!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! GRAB THE NOVEL NOW, START IT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP AND FINISH IT, AS DAWN SETS IN, THE NEXT DAY."
3,Alright,"I thought that and then there were none was an overall good book. There were some ideas that were a little far-fetched, such as the identity of the killer and the entire ending of the book. However, i thought that the 10 Little Indians poem added a very mysterious twist to the book; along with the 10 Indian figurines that one by one mysteriously dissapeared as each person was killed off. Even though i was forced to read this book for summer reading, and it wasnt strictly for my enjoyment, i would recommend it to someone who is interested on reading a good mystery book."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,Ten strangers are gathered on an island by a mysterious host. Together they share their deepest secrets about their dark past and one by one they begin to die.
3,good but could be better,"I really enjoy the tension and suspense the book creates especially in the last few chapters (from Ch 13 onward when the few people left were so frightened and alert). That I think is the strongest point of the book.The confession of the murderer(s) in the epilogue is ok, though I did expect something more surprising and ... convincing. There are a few points in the murderer(s)'s plan and in the story development itself that are not very believable. [The butler still prepared breakfast after the second murder, as if there's nothing particularly unusual happen???] That is, the book is a bit too contrived.But over all, if you have 5, 6 hours to spare and like detective stories, why not?"
3,Meh.,"This was my first Agatha Christie, and it's an ok mystery novel. I never felt completely drawn into it, and I found Christie's use of dramatic ellipses especially over-the-top annoying. Lack of a complete resolution was also irritating. I'm frankly surprised that it's been so highly reviewed by everyone else here."
4,And Then There Were None,"This book was spellbinding; a good Agatha Christie for those familiar with her writing and a wonderful addition to the newly christened Agatha Christie fan. There was no way of knowing who dun it; The details were carefully written, and the clues carefully laid out. Since it was first published in 1939, and then 1940, under the name Ten Little Indians, I'm not sure how many readers this book has seen. It is the old title that the new title will remember. Agatha Christie is also easy to read, with one chapter flowing easily into the next, making it just as hard to put down because of the plot as with the written story. The ending is surprising, but rereading could identify the suspects better, maybe. There are some grousome details, but Agatha Christie writes neatly and to the point; no scary, put on the night light, look under the bed stuff - unless, ofcourse, you don't like a murder tale."
4,Great Book,The book was very gripping with opinions and points of view from all 10 of the main characters. I had not been an Agatha reader before but I intend to read more of her novels. I also liked the small size of the book and the glossy cover. It made for a neat package that was easy to carry. I received the item promptly and in very good condition.
3,Hold your breath; this book is cunning and dark...,"This book will have a grasp on you as soon as you open it. Ten strangers, a curious assortment of men and women from different walk of life, are summoned as weekend guests to a private island off the coast of Devon by a mysterious man U. N. Owen. Each guest identifies common relations with Owen and yet Owen is unknown to them. It is a pre-announced murder spree. One by one, the house guests fall prey to an unknown, myseterious killer in the house, according to the scheme walled up in individual guest room-the rhyme of ten Indian boys. This is a book that fills up with suspense, panic, and thrill. As more house guests fall prey, the remnants escalate vigilance but also distrust. Speculation and doubts roam in of their mind. And only the dead are above suspicion. This is definitely a page turner. I finish the book in a day, with perspiring hands, accelerating pulse and a cloud of speculation in my mind. Good read. 3.3 stars."
3,"Good premise, but could have been executed better","I did not really like this book. It was too wordy and wasn't suspenseful at all with all of the accusations thrown around by those still among the living. It was further ruined by who I actually figured out was the murderer. There was no climax, no fear, nothing. The poem sounded so suspenseful, but didn't deliver.Everyone is so flat. And it's hard to remember who is who, and I felt like I spent half of the book trying to remember who each one was. Sometimes Christie reminds you, but most times she doesn't. I found myself hopelessly flipping through pages of repetitive dialogue to get to the next murder, only to be disappointed it was no big spectacle. I understand that things were more ""conservative"" when she wrote it, but I've read more suspenseful things during that time period than this.Needless to say, I will not be picking up another of her novels."
4,And Then There Were None & Ten Little Indians,AND THEN THERE WERE NONE was also was published under TEN LITTLE INDIANS. This book was excellent. I thought it was much better than THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD. AND THEN THERE WERE NONE was suspenseful and kept you guessing until the end.
5,Keeps you on the edge,"I love this book. The first time reading it I was truly perplexed. It is an amazing mystery that will have you guessing up until the shocking end. It's a classic in the mystery genre and everyone should read it, you won't want to put it down!"
5,And Then There Were None-by Agatha Christie,"And Then There Were None was one of my all-time favorite mysteries. Agatha Christie keeps you hooked!! It starts of a little slow in the beginning but as soon as they all arrive on the island and the mysterious record is played with every persons deepest-darkest secrets and the mystery starts to unfold. As soon as people started explaining the secrets that were told about them, they begin to mysteriously die. It all relates to a cruel rhyme about the 10 little indians. it catches your attention until the very last page. It also has a twist at the end. It is just an awesome book! If you like mysteries and twists you will love this book. i couldn't put it down! way to go agatha christie!"
4,and then there were none,"and then there were none was a novel anbout a group of 10 people who are all invited to a mysterious house on Indian Island. All these people have one thing in common, and that is that they have all committed a crime. Some of the crimes were accidental but some of them were unintentional. Mysteriously the people staying in the house start dying one by one. The deaths appear to be accidenta but are they? This mystery is well written and keeps you curious the whole book. THe speech of the charaters may be a little difficult to understand for some people, but otherwise and then there were none was a suspenseful and exciting novel."
5,Ten Little Indian Boys...,"This was a good book I read the whole thing in about two days! It was really interesting. And every page requires u to think. But the ending of it was not really what i expected. And the person who did the murders just ruined everything. It would have been better if it was all supernatural. Not just a parson of a block. His proffession and all didn't really go to the thigs he did. But aside from the ending which surprised me a lot, it was a good book and I would reccomend any1 that would enjoy a good game of Clue."
3,And Then There Were None,"The book And Then there Were None was very interesting. This book was about ten people that were invited to go to a mansion on Indian Island. Through the book they all end up dieing one by one in the same way as the indians in the childrens poem Ten Little Indians. The mystery is to find out who is the person that is killing them off. The book gives you hints to who the the killer my be, and just when you think you know who the killer is that person may get killed. To find out who the killer is you have to read it for yourself.I thought that this wood was very interesting and a great mystery. To many people this may be the kind of book that you can't put down,but to me it was the kind of book that i liked to put down. Then when i finished it I thought over all it was a good book. I donbt think i would read it again. I think many people may think different because i am not the kind of person that reads a lot of books, and it talks a lot for me to really to into the book."
5,The best mystery novel!,This book is the best mystery novel ever written as well as the best mystery play. The suspense as we watch the Indian figures destoryed is nerve wracking. The characters are great and the final chapter is breathtaking. An excellent fastepaced read.
5,Best Book I Have Ever Read,"I picked this book from a list of Books for a 9th grade english assignment. Iam now in the 10th grade and I loved the book. It leaves you guessing and wondering who the killer was! I absolutey HATE to read, and I sat and read this whole book in one day. If this book shows up on a list to rea..it is a must pick. it is even good enough just go out and buy!"
5,Read this book!! :o),"I consider the book, And Then There Were None, one of the best mystery novels that I have ever read. It is the story of 10 complete strangers lured to Indian Island by an annonymous host. Unable to leave the island, the guests begin to share many of their deepest and darkest secrets. When strange occurences start to happen, one by one, they die. I find Agatha Cristie one of the best suspense authors of our time. She is a very descriptive writer that can leave you hanging after every chapter. Personally, I couldn't put the book down. This book would be good for mature readers. I think that the more ""mature audiences"" would have an overall understanding of what is happening and could follow the story line better. I think that this is a great book and you should definitely read it!"
4,"A Fun, Twisted Bid for Justice!","I'd read virtually zilch mystery novels prior to this one, but found it most enjoyable. It contains a twisted nod to justice, lots of interesting dialogue, and an ending that could easily leave you hanging, but does not. There are several plausible scenarios as to ""who-done-it"" that will flicker through your mind while reading, but in the end you may find you were more astutely aware of the most plausible than you thought. So definitely give figuring out the mystery a try; and oh yeah, I've given just an itty, bitty hint in this review ;)"
5,The Best of the Best,"Arguably Christie's masterpiece, and certainly her darkest tale, And Then There Were None takes you to Indian Island where 10 strangers have been lured to face the unspeakable crime each has committed and gotten away with....until now. As each of the 10 die one by one, the other realize the net is closing in and there's no way to discover their unknown avenger or escape his or her unerring execution of justice. Brilliantly written, you can feel the atmosphere of suspicion and dread growing with each death and a twist ending that only the most astute will see coming."
5,Great mystery. I did not guess the ending,"I became interested after watching Family Guy's ""And Then There were Fewer"". This book was very entertaining and I read it fast. I could not put it down. And the ending was a shock."
1,Poor Kindle transcription,"The publisher did a terrible job transferring this book to Kindle. Pages appear out of order. Page numbers and headers show up mid text. And odd code-like characters everywhere. Have you ever tried to copy and paste a whole page from PDF? It's that jumbled. I gave up reading this book a few pages in.Update 24 July 2012: to their credit, Amazon issued a refund quickly."
3,"A bit dated, but still decent","This book came free with the PC game of the same name (it was originally titled Ten Little Indians) and even though playing the game (specifically, playing the end trailer) does give away the mystery, it was still a good solid read. Though you don't see as much into each of the characters as you might expect, I don't think story is hurt by it. I hesitate to say that it's not a character driven story, because in a way it really is, but the main focus is how the characters interact with one another - not... who they are on the inside, if that makes sense. And though I disagree with a lot of the utterly sexist clap-trap spouted in the book by the male characters, well, you have to remember that it's a much older book! Times have indeed changed. I wouldn't say this tops my list of Agatha Christie books, but it's not bad."
5,I read this book in less than eight hours. It's that good.,"This is flat out Agatha's best book ever. Despite the fact someone already spoiled who-dun-it for me, I was still stunned by the outcome. Tightly plotted, masterfully written, this novel has no peer.The premise is simple: ten strangers invited to an island with a newly built mansion for a free weekend. When they arrive, they discover the host is no where to be found, and a recorded message accuses each of them for murder in their shadowy past. And one by one they are picked off, just like the old nursery rhyme. ""Ten little Indians went out to dine. One choked his little self and then there were nine."" As each murder is carried it, everyone slowly suspects each other. And one by one, ten little china Indian dolls dissapear from the dining room... Wonderful, with a gracefull, stunning plot."
3,"very........weird, odd, scary","i read this book and did a book report on it ... it was very spooky. it was intriguing too. the first few pages are boring, but as you keep reading you won't want to put the book down. every time i hear that poem, the ten little indians, i think of this book. the poem is the basis of the book. and you don't really know who killed who until the end and it's not who you expect it to be. i liked it and in a way i didn't cause like, one person thinking of how to kill everyone is just kinda pyschotic. and i thought it was weird. but it was coo i guess. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone that's not in highschool. it's too crazy. actually no one should read it cause some ppl might get ideas like that. i plan on renting the movie this week to see it. i'm going to be even more spooked."
5,One word to describe this book- Wow!,"The book seems to capture one's mind; the suspence grips one to never let go of it. The human behavior of the people on the island is perfectly described, creating a clear image in ones mind. Though there are points of dullness in the story, the suspence of the mystery covers it up. This book is one of the best of Agatha Cristie."
4,Book Review,"The book And Then There Were None, was a terrific book. It was probably the best mystery novel that i have ever read. The suspense she created was masterful. She made me sit on the top of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. She kept you guessing after every chapter. The way she finished the book was outstanding as well. Ten people that have only one thing in common are invited to the island for what they thnk is a vacation. The one thing they have in common is that they are all going to die on the island by a mystery killer. The way the killer carries out the killings and who the killer is are facts that you will have to find out when you read the book. I recommend this book to people of all ages that range from high school and up."
5,This book is tensely mind boggling suspensive story!!! :o),"The first time I read this book was in my eighth grade language arts class.(right now I'm a ninth grader) I was assigned to read this agatha Christie book which I thought would never interest me, but when I started reading it I couldn't put it down!I finished the whole thing in one afternoon! It was so thrilling and suspenseful!after every chapter I told myself i would read the rest tommorrow but when the chapter ended I couldn't hold myself back.This book is a thrilling carnival ride in which the suspense never ended. It was a true mystery.This book was a tensely mind boggling story! Agatha Christie must have a real intellectual; imagination for writing books"
5,Certainly Enlightining,"My class was assigned this book after finishing up ""The Hobbit"" and have been doing a variaty of activities concering it. Roleplays, placing oursleves inside the minds of the characters and how we feel they would react to the situations given to them helps you to understand the book more. I found myself captured by this book and its unexpected plot twists and the delightfully refreashing discord the characters had been placed in, as well as the colorful backrounds and the constant air of suspence and suspicion on each page. To put it in a simple phrase, this book is just astounding."
1,"Boring, Bizarre, & Bologne",I think that this book is very stupid. It has no story to it and I think it is boring. Bizarre things happen in the little bit of plot that there is. Take my advice on this one...DONT READ IT! Only read it if you have too much time on your hands and want to be bored.
3,And Then There Were None,And Then There Were None is an exciting mystery that keeps you on you toes. This novel leaves you guessing after every chapter. Ten strangers bond together by an accidental killing are drawn to an island by a mysterious U.N. Owen to face their death. All of the deaths are following a nusery rhyme about 10 little indians. While the group of strangers are trying to decide who the mysterious U.N. Owen is and the killer they are killed one by one. If you like mysteries be sure to pick this one up. You won't be able to put it down.
3,A Classic and A Must Read For All Mystery Lovers,"Mystery is not my favorite genre by far but I just had to read at least one Agatha Christie novel. And Then There Were None is one of her best, if not most famous book. It centers around the arrival of ten strangers to a secluded island where one by one they're picked off. The killer remains anonymous to the end and as a reader you're going to try to guess who's it is and just when you think you have it solved, surprise-you're wrong! This book is the basis for the 80's cult classic Clue. One of my favorite movies, so if you've seen that you basically know the entire book but why not read the original. Just when you think you know what's going on A.C. has some nice surprises in store for you!"
4,And then there were none,"There were ten people gathered on a mysterious island. The night they get there a recording comes on convicting every person of a murder. From then on the people die one by one according to a rhyme. In the end everyone was dead and nobody could figure out how they died. If you want to find out who the host was,who the murderer was,and how all the people on the island were killed, you will have to read the book. This book was an excellent book if you are the kind of person that likes being in suspense thoughout the book."
5,Very good book I LOVED it!!!,I just loved this book I don`t really like books that talk about death but this one I liked.
4,Vintage Agatha Christie,"A cracking good Agatha Christie murder mystery with no detective (until the very end). Written in 1939 and set in that time, it omits the modern crime-solving techniques and even things like cell phones. It doesn't take long for the reader to be swept up in the situation at hand, however, and to try to guess the identity of the murderer, until he or she is murdered. The end seems a bit contrived, but plausible. A good book for a discussion group."
5,Better Than the Movie,"I remember watching the movie ""Ten Little Indians"" as a young adult and thoroughly enjoying it. As an adult I realized I'd never read any of Agatha Chistie's novels and settled on this one. It was so enjoyable reading the novel and realizing thedifferences from the movie. If you enjoyed the movie you should read the book!"
4,My first Agatha...not as impressed as I thought I'd be,"This was my first Agatha Christie book. I knew she was the famed ""best selling mystery writer"" and I guess when you hear all the hype your expectations soar. While the book wasn't bad, I found some of it perplexing and somewhat difficult to swallow. While the motive was sneaky, I didn't feel that Christie persuaded me enought to make it believable. None the less, I tried another book...""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"". Please look up that book to see my review on it."
2,Thought it was cheesy,"This book was probably a big hit in its day but it seems pretty cheesy. My son needed to read it for his 8th grade English class. There are much better books out there. I am not quite sure why they picked this book. The word ""queer"" is used quite often which would give these students a very low grade (if they were writing a paper) for repeating the same word not to mention it made them laugh every time they read the word. At first, it is hard to keep track of who each character is. It didn't hold my interest. Many people enjoy this type of writing, but based on this book, I would not read another one of her books. I understand it had a original title different from this. I didn't appreciate that and maybe it was acceptable during its time but it doesn't sit well with me. Google it if you want to learn more. Instead of ten little soldiers it was ten little Indians which was changed from ten little (not a word I would repeat)."
3,the case of the missing character page,"This is a fabulous mystery novel, a classic. I would recommend it to one and all. HOWEVER, this particular edition is missing a vital component, namely the list and description of the major characters which has been included at the beginnning of every Agatha Christy novel that I have read, including other editions of this one. The ommission of this list makes it extremely difficult for anyone not familiar with the book to follow the plot. The reasoning behind St. Martin's Press's decision to ommitt this list of characters is indeed a mystery worth solving. My advice is to find another edition of the book elsewhere. Amazon needs to sell an editon which includes this important element."
5,Great Service,"It was easy to deal with the shipper, and the product arrived quickly. Great service, and I would gladly recommend this company to anyone."
5,mysterious and suspenceful murder story,"And Then There Were None is a great book. This is because it is fun to read, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are many twists in the book concerning who the murderer really is. Each murder is filled with suspense and mystery that keeps you wondering about who killed the victim. When you think that you know who the murderer is, this book will prove you wrong. When you start to read this book, you will want to keep reading until the book is over. Agatha Christie writes this book with great suspense, twists, and mysterious occurrences."
5,Great Thrilling Books,"If you like thrilling books, you will like And Then There Were None. These ten random people get invited to a island. But there is a trick. They all are getting killed one by one. They can't find the killer and don't know it is one of them. They are all so confused which causes them to not be alert and be killed. This is a great read because you never know who is going to get killed next and don't know the killer while you are reading. Agatha Christi is a great mystery writer, and I recommend any of her books to mystery readers. I read this book with my class and they all loved it."
4,Good Mystery Story,"This was a decent book. It was very slow getting started, almost hard to understand for younger readers. This book was about 10 different people who did'nt know each other who were intited to this island called ""Indian Island."" Through out there stay at this island, one bye one, they started to get killed off.No one could figure out who was doing the killing. Everyone had there own ideas on what was going on. Everyone was blaming each other and everyone was really scared. Basically it was every man for themselves.The reason I did like this book though was because it made you want to keep reading. You thought you knew just who was doing the killing, then bam, there dead too. The end was pretty weak. Other then that this was a decent book and a pretty good read."
4,Suspense,"And Then There Were None provides a riveting story of secrets, blackmail, and murder. However, the beginning pace is slow adding to the attention one must pay if they are to understand what is going on. Once the murders start suspision grows and each must claim their innocence before they are the next to be killed. A couple steps up from Nancy Drew this book is best suited for ages fourteen and up."
5,The Best Book Ever Written,"This is truly the best book ever written!! It's no wonder Christie is called ""The Queen of Crime!"" It keeps you guessing right until the end! You'd never guess the killer. It's the first Christie book I've read, and I think it's going to be better than any of her other books."
5,One of the all-time greats,"While I loved the movie, I was not prepared for the difference in the endings between the book and the movie. Reminds me of the two movie versions of The Vanishing, American and German.This is a must-read for mystery writers. A true old-fashioned thriller and if you love Christie, this is her best."
5,Two Thumbs up for Agatha Christie,"This is the first Agatha Christie book I have ever read, and after the thrilling experience it gave me, it surely won't be the last. It is about ten strangers each lured to an island where they are all accused of murder. All though it is rattling, none of the people take it seriously; until one person drops dead. Suspicions are raised as each person accuses one another as the murderer.As the days progress, more of the ten original guests are murdered in gruesome, sick ways, all according to the children's rhyme of what someone would never suspect.This book is thrilling and mysterious. Agatha's unique style of writing is captivating so that you can't put the book down. You won't be able to figure out `who done it', when only the dead are above suspicion."
3,Has It's Charm,"I enjoyed this ""period piece"" for what it was, an old fashioned, English, whodunit. This was very early work for Agatha Christie and she was very good at keeping clear the ongoing multiple characters, making it a very easy read."
4,Required School Reading,This was a required reading for my son. He enjoyed it and said it was the best book they ever required them to read. He said it was a good murder mystery.
5,Fun Read,"Christie's clues are subtle, but it all come together nicely in the end. I was not really surprised by ""who - dunnit"" - just surprised that the villian knew these ""strangers"" so well."
5,Twist of an ending,Hmmm Maybe it was just the way she kicked the chair so that it landed like that against the wall
5,One of the BEST mysteries of all time!!!,"""And Then There Were None"" has got to be one of the best books of all time. It puts the ""thrill"" in ""thriller"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was so engaged in reading it that my fingers felt stuck to the book by the time I had to place it down. Agatha Christie had a great story put into this mystery, and I know that this is a mystery that lives up to its genre. For those of you out there who love mysteries, this should be one of the books that is a must-read."
5,And then there were none.,It took a while to get into this book but once engrossed I still did not anticipate the ending. Enjoyed very much.
5,There can only be ONE !!!,"Barring the many controversies that this book generated over the several decades since its first publication, ""And Then There Were None"" probably ranks among the BEST works of crime fiction ever written.From the haunting title to the seemingly harmless yet eerie nursery rhyme,the story deals with the accidental(?) meeting of ten unrelated individuals, each with a shady past and all of whom are now stranded on a desolate island off the south-western English coast. There is a problem though....at large on the island is a maniacal murderer who knows everyone's troubled past! This person now calculatingly begins to eliminate the visitors one by one. But where is this person, what's the motive and how far would this person go? I wouldn't want to be the one to spoil this by revealing any further, but if you are a mystery buff, go no further. An absolute page turner and a classic for many generations to come.Kashyap MothaliVirginia, USA"
3,And Then There Were None.,"Ten people are brought to an island by a mysterious host. While on they are on the island they are all confronted with a murder that they all commited. But the law can't prove that they did what they did. So they get away free. But then one by one they are all killed of for the severity of their murders. This book is a real page turner. i personally didn't like the book, but if you like murder mysteries then you will love this book, baby."
1,Great Book Bad Recording,"I love Agatha Christie's book and Hugh Fraser is a great narrator, but the poor reproduction on the cd is disappointing. I sent my first copy back thinking I just got a bad couple of disks. The new disks had the same skips and pops in the same places. Selling something as new in this condition is at best an unfortunate oversight and at worse deceptive."
5,great!!!!,"I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK MORE THAN JUST A 10, MORE LIKE A 100!!!THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I'VE EVER READ BY AGATHA CHRISTIE!!AND NOW I'M ALL READY HOOKED AND WANT TO GET MORE OF HER WRITEING!!!!!I WOULD RECOMMED THIS BOOK TO.... JUST ABOUT ANYONE!!!I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!"
5,The best mystery I've ever read!,This was the first book I read by Agatha Christie; I read it in school. The ending is so unpredictable yet so simple. Read this book if you have not already
5,A spectacular mystery,"Ten people are invited to a mysterious island by old friends they know. All the guests become trapped on the island by a vicious storm.It is only after a short while that everyone of them is accused of murder. One by one the guest begin to die deaths relating to an old nursery rhyme entitled ""Ten Little Indian Boys"". Also, every time a guest dies, one of the china indian figures seated on the table in the dining room dissappear. Eventually the guests realize that the murderer must be one of them since there is no one else on the island. The murderer was a complete shock to me and the story is ingeniously plotted. I recommend this book to any die-hard mystery/crime fans. You will love absolutely love it."
5,Keeps you guessing!,"As a seasoned mystery fan, I'm fussy about the quality of the mysteries that I read. This classic by Christie will NOT disappoint. She weaves her tale so cleverly, creates characters with such detail, and skillfully sets the scene. If you're like me, this one will drag you in and keep you reading all night long. Pick it up on a Friday night, and you'll be finished sometime on Saturday ... it's that compelling once you get into the plot. And when you think you know who it is, guess again, she'll surprise you. Enough of a spooky-factor to make you nervous as you read. The characters are very believable. Very human and real people she's created for this one. Enjoy!"
5,Thoughtful lyrics and slammin' beats.,"Man, this album is everything you'd expect it to be. Master Ace spits every lyric like it's his last, each line full of thoughtfullness and cleverness. And the tandem of Marley Marl and Mr. Cee dug up some FONKY basslines to compliment Ace's flow. A must-have album, for beatheads and thinkers alike."
3,Dora lover enjoyed hopscotch with Dora and friends,"This product allowed by four year old daughter to play hopscotch inside. She enjoyed it, but doesn't play on it very often. The pictures are bright and colorful and mats are made of foam so very safe."
5,a cute comedy,"i thought it was a cute comedy about witches, spells, and relationships. Jimmy Stewart put on a fine performance in this film. I think everyone should watch it at least once."
5,Wonderful Witchcraft!,"This film is a wonderful classic love story with a twist. Anyone who remembers the early episodes of Bewitched is bound to see the similarities. It has become one of my ""comfort"" movies."
5,Classic Jimmy Stewart,"What can I say? It's a classic, with an outstanding supporting cast. Jimmy's co-star Kim Novak will leave you drooling into your lap, and Jack Lemmon with Ernie Kovacks and Hermione Gingold will give you more than it's right to expect. Funny, thoughtful and somewhat wistful in the fact that there aren't any witches like these in the real world. If you've never seen it (much less owned it as I do) then you've only shorted yourself out of a genuinely fine movie experience. A keeper."
4,"Charming, and charmingly dated","How can a movie about the Dark Arts be so adorable? The thought of Jimmy Stewart in such a wacky film -- covens of witches and warlocks hanging out at hidden clubs (shades of Harry Potter) was too good to pass up. He did not disappoint, stammering and hamming his way through the twists and turns of his unusual romance with a witch in classic fashion. Kim Novak was excellent as well -- strong, confident, beautiful and tortured, with a cold edge perfect for a powerful witch. Ernie Kovacs turned in a great performance as well as an unbalanced writer constantly on the prowl for witches and a good barbershop. Jack Lemmon as a bongo playing, beatster warlock was something to behold (seriously, hipsters, he had the routine down a long time ago). Although, the cat -- Pyewacket -- stole the show. A love story that's perfect to watch on a lazy Sunday morning with some killer lines: Queenie: She's in love. Nicky: Wouldn't she rather be dead?"
3,"Bell, Book andCandle","Move was ok, cute. It was a used DVD and the sound was terrible! Maybe I would have liked the movie better if I could have heard it."
5,Old but Good,This purchase was for someone that likes old films. It arrived timely and the quality was very good. It was certainly a good choice.
4,The Special Star is Ernie Kovacks,"While this is a very fine and funny film, what makes it special is Ernie Kovacks, an early TV great who died before America had the chance to make him great..."
2,To bad,"To bad the movie was to bad . The sound faided and the video was in a word not sharp, the colors just bled together. Will Time take away the thing we treasure. ART"
4,Post-war nuclear yum yum,"I think this movie is best described as cute, campy, and sexy. Taken in the context of the times, this film just oozes sensuality, and does it with style and class. It's all over this film, and it's verrrry,.......... affective. The filming is gorgeous, top notch for this type of film. The chemistry between Novak and Stewart is more than believable, it's borderline scandalous. What a great date movie,...wow.! There is nothing about this film that isn't cute, sentimental, and yummy. If you're not feeling that, you're watching the wrong movie."
3,An Entertainment,"James Stewart and Kim Novak star in this movie about a publisher (Stewart) who crosses paths with a witch (Novak) who is looking for some excitement. There's nothing serious about this film but it is great fun to watch two good actors with chemistry at work. Though the film was release in the late 1950's, the set and some of the language definitely lets you know that the 1960's aren't far away. If you're looking for some lite entertainment and something different, give Bell, Book and Candle a try."
2,Do not apprreciate witchcraft,This movie was recommended to me and I do not watch or read anything with switches good or bad. I am a born again believer & this is not my preference. I never finished watching the video
2,spoiler alert!,"This ridiculous premise seems much more suited for a modern B-movie than a classic. I cant believe Stewart accepted such a silly script. Lemmon is as good as can be expected and the only redeeming part is when Kim becomes human. woops! did i just give it away?! no matter, there are far better love stories to see. Lastly something must be said about her brows! I understand shes a witch but theyre so huge and distracting throughout, her beauty is completely overshadowed."
4,Lots of laughs,"Bell, Book and Candle should be interesting to a new audience today because of the recent interest in magic and the occult. Since it did not take these matters too seriously, it was an enjoyable romantic romp."
4,"Not as good as Vertigo, but very pleasing...","I bought the DVD. I saw the film when it was released many years ago. It's a fun film with a great cast. Jimmy Stewart is a charming in this as he was in Harvey, and Kim Novak is great. The best performance is given by Jack Lemmon -- brother warlock (seeing the fiendish look on his face as he plays the drums is worth the price of the DVD). Ernie Kovaks is his usual self--mildly funny. Several British actresss play witches (Hermione Gingold, Elsa Lancaster) and they are as droll as their modern counterparts Maggie Smith and Judy Dench."
3,NOVAK'S CAT AND KIM'S FEET,"I cannot be objective with a movie starring James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon and Elsa Lanchester. Even if director Richard Quine's BELL, BOOK AND CANDLE is not a masterpiece, the movie is still a lot better than the 90 % of the actual production of Hollywood.Kim Novak is perfect in the role of a sentimental witch longing for something different. The seduction's scene of James Stewart is already part of Movie History. Remember her eyes ?The scene in the Zodiac night-club with an incredible performance of Jack Lemmon and the Ernie Kovacs show are also worth multiple viewings.Too bad that the DVD is not at the level of the film. Images are grainy and colours mix dangerously. Columbia/Tristar can do a lot better.A DVD for the nostalgic ones."
5,A quirky gem!!!...,"If you viewed the Hitchcock Masterpiece Vertigo, then you should wish to see the teaming again of the stunningly beautiful Novak and Stewart in this tale of witches in Manhattan. Stewart is the henpecked fiance of the socialite that used to be a college roomate of Novak. Now Stewart is Novak's tenant, who does not suspect he is surrounded by witches. The whole cast is perfection with a very young Jack Lemmon playing her younger witch brother.Great fun!! A nice contrast to the heavy melodrama of Vertigo."
5,"Bell, Book and Candle","This one of the classic old movies. I saw it long ago and wanted to buy it but it is such a classic that it was too expensive up until now. Kim Novak, a great and beautiful actress is a witch with a mind reading cat. Witches cannot fall in love but James Stewart is boyfriend to an old nemesis of hers so she casts a spell on him so that he will like her instead. You can guess the outcome. It is a truly great movie."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"This product doen't even deserve 1 star, but thats the only option I've got. Save your money! I bought this so that I could have a radio option for my iPod. It is useless. The reception is poor, the design is lousy and the volume control is subpar. The radio does not have a preset option and doesn't show what radio station is selected. The volume control only has two settings - low and high. Even more frustrating is that the volume level will drop as soon as it is plugged into a device (such as an iPod). If you're thinking of purchasing this for your iPod, or for any other reasons, save your money."
1,cheezy,"I bought this expecting another ""Novus Magnificat"" or ""Sacred Space Music"", both of which I highly recommend. This I found really dated and boring - not stimulating at all. If ""Novus Magnificat"" is Miles Davis' ""Kinda Blue"", then ""Set Free"" is Kenny G. If you dig John Tesh or Yanni, you'll like this."
3,One hit wonder,"After listening to Walz of Joy, I bought this album hoping to find more good music.I only found 2 or 3 ok tracks but very far from the quality of the first track."
3,Great Series But Faulty Discs,"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I needed to on this. First off this is one of my favorite anime series and the box-sets are worth the investment, but the reason why I gave this box-set 3 stars is the fact that the third and fourth disc don't work on an Xbox 360. It's not just the one I have, because I've ordered this before more than once and it just wouldn't play right. The episodes would repeat or skip no matter what I did."
5,YU YU HAKUSHO,I got the item on time and in good condition. It was all that I asked for so all I can say is that I am very grateful.I recommend this series to any anime fan out there!
3,A Little Disappointment,"I love this series, and was bummed like any other fan to see it canceled. So I bought the box sets to enjoy. I got to this particular one and found out that the third disc was completely defective.Video files were missing altogether.I went through the process of returning and exchanging this item four times before I gave up.Hopefully this issue has been resolved, but it definitely still exists as a problem a buyer could encounter."
1,Great Show.. faulty disc :(,My boyfriend and i were getting back into watching yu yu hakusho and so i bought all the seasons for him and we were on the fourth season and when we got to disc 3 it started to repeat episodes in place of the episodes that should have been there same with disc four. GREAT SHOW but i wish i could get a refund or a replacement. :(-not so satisfied customer
2,disappointed!!!,I have been buying on here for a long time and have been very sastified with everything i have gotten. I will admit that I have never left a review but that's because I stay real busy and I'm sorry that my first review is a bad one. This item and the one that came with it arrived two days late and on top of that this item in particular Yu Yu Hakusho: Season 4's case has two broken pieces inside and one of those pieces held the extra disc tray in place so when i opened it two of the discs were just sliding around inside and that upset me because I collect blu rays and take very good care of my movies and do not like for my cases or movies to be damaged in anyway.
3,Incredibles toy is incredible,"The toy is a quality toy. Posable arms and legs. Nothing fancy by any means, but still a nice collectable."
5,Beyond Victimhood,"A ""victimhood"" epidemic rages for many people who are survivors. These survivors may have been physically or emotionally abused. They have survived extreme cases of conditional ""love"" which require them to ""earn"" dignity and love by meeting abusive or unrealistic expectations.The problem occurs when survivors label themselves ""victims"" long after a healing process has begun. This victim mentality can prevent people from attaining complete wholeness and true peace of mind.In Beyond Victimhood, Tom Fitzgerald recognizes that surface or behavioral changes are not enough - that ""we make a real difference in our own lives when we strive to make a real difference in the lives of others."" Not just a ""feel good"" book, Beyond Victimhood is a practical resource, containing a hands-on process to embrace the future, an annotated reading list to enrich self-understanding, and a litany of daily reminders to help maintain focus.--- from book's back cover."
5,Australias most beloved band!!,"I won't go on and on about the quality of the sound or picture on this DVD. This show is so full of emotion, from both the band and the audience. Witness the last two tracks. The looks on the faces of the audience; but especially the band members themselves. Paul Hester, who joked it up throughout the show, is nearly in tears towards the end of ""Don't Say It's Over"". How sad it is that he's not here now to be reunited with the rest of the group, as rumored. This is one fine show. But it still brings a tear to your eye at the end."
5,SENSATIONAL,"A perfect band,a perfect night,a perfect city. This is a visual and audio delight. The quality is top notch. Being the bands last show adds tremendous emotion to the event. These are absolutely fantastic songs played on the forecourt of the beautiful Sydney Opera House. It is just amazing to witness how good this band actually was. I had no idea until I saw this show.Reflecting back on this show does evoke a sadness that the drummer Paul Hester is no longer with us. He was a true character and it comes through completely on this DVD. Its strange how we often dont realise/appreciate how special someone is until they are gone.This show is a must for anyone who wants to hear brilliantly crafted songs. The spectacle of the Sydney Opera House and surrounds also makes this a show all Australians and KIWIs alike should be proud of.I cannot imagine anyone being dissapointed in owning this DVD set."
3,Good for the price,"The first screen had either manufacturing defects or shipping damage to the screen. The seller is very responsive and replaced it quickly. The second one also had a similar issue, but not nearly as apparent. I ended up keeping it based on the likelihood of the third still having issues and because the issue was not terribly apparent when installed. For the price, this is a good solution and it does look much more expensive when in place. It is fairly well built and functions as intended."
3,please but unsatisfied,"the customer service was awesome,I received the item very fast.it look good for my fireplace.but the only pblm is the screen doesn't stay flush against the fireplace wall."
5,Soft lust,"This is the kind of CD you can put on when the two of you are sharing a quiet evening reading at opposite ends of the couch... and you'd rather you weren't reading, or at opposite ends! Potent."
5,Still loving this album,I got this album in early 90s. It is still fresh and good to listen again and again. I don't know what happen to them. I wish they have more music like this. I am desperate to get their lyrics.
3,Doesn't hold a lot of pee,I have a 3 month puggle and this particular size doesn't seem to be enough for a day. I end up using 2/day even after taking him to pee outside in between. It also leaks and doesn't absorb as much as some others that I have tried before.
2,Sheets are small,"Puppies need larger sheets, and these are too small. Otherwise, just buy the generic ones."
2,Not for us!,This male puppy (Pom/ Yorkie) peed every where; but on the pad. So didn't work out for our needs! Purchased for our sons new pup
5,Superior absorption!,"We inherited a small, elderly chihuahua who was paper trained from day one. We have tried many different types of pads, and these definitely are the best we have used so far. They are a nice size, and we have not had any leakage. They are thicker than most and hold the liquids well. We are very satisfied!"
4,Very good,Very good product! Specially love the quantity for the price! Not the best of all but it is the best for the price/quantity.Would recommend 100%And also would buy over and over again
5,Great for cats too,Son recently moved back home with his two cats. One with anxiety problems. She has been urinating on these pads ever since he put them down instead of my carpets. They are worth every penny :-)
4,dog pad holder,product held pee pee bad in place and dog didin[t tear it or rip it. Neat looking and invites dog to stay on pad while performing his business
2,"As others have mentikoned, very poor quality with little cotton filling.","I mistakenly ordered this brand of pads, when I meant to REORDER another brand I've used. But since I'd run out, I just accepted this order and began using it. It took me a while ....I thought I waa imaginging things but....the cotton inside these pads is not uniform at all. There are entire sections of the pad where I can see clear through the other side of the blue plastic, because there is no cotton in between.My other pads I'd bought...they were VERY white all the way through the entire pad. These pads are white in part, and blue in others (cuz there's no cotton). Someone else in a review said that there were better quality pads out there, made in the U.S. I didn't notice but let me guess....these ones come from (ugh) China?? I can't think of anything of good quality that ever comes out of China....."
3,Great for the price,"While these aren't my favorite puppy pads, you can't beat the price so they are good value. My puppy tends to pee and poo on the side of the pad so I'm always having issues with puddling around/under the pad. There are other brands that are more absorbent (less messy), but we usually end up buying these due to the price."
4,Great pads!,"Great!takes care of the problem, just wish it was a bit larger. I looked for larger pads but price wise this was the beat option. We like it well enough to order it again."
3,They leak!,So I've been looking for a wee wee pad for my Yorker that will not leak through. These are not it! Every time my Yorker pees on the wee wee pad I'm left having to mop te floor. Not what I expected.
5,Awesome quality!,"I was previously buying my potty pads from the dollar store. I was disappointed with the absorbency of those as I would pick them up and the pee would just run off. So I needed to find a better brand. I came across these and the price is right even cheaper than the dollar store! I am so impressed by the level of absorbency, no messes even if she pees really close to the edge of the pad! I love them and I will definitely be repurchasing!"
4,Meets the Need,"I have a cat who doesn't always make it to her box and these work good for those times. They are absorbent, but not as much as I'd like them to be. I don't use them in a holder so I can't say how they fare in one of those. My cat prefers them over other brands so I'll keep buying them for her."
5,"great product, great price.","These are standard, high-quality puppy pads. They do their job well, and this may be the best deal on the internet. I search long, and I ended up with these as they are not noted for being cheaply made or ineffective. I'm satisfied, and I'll purchase these again at this price."
5,Solved my ferret bathroom problem!,"In my case, these pads were a GODSEND! I have two ferrets I got as adults that are not housebroken and refuse to be trained. I was sooo tired of pulling my hair out over the hassle of keeping my carpet clean (which was a lost battle) when I stumbled on these pads. They worked PERFECTLY for my situation (and I'm certain would work just as well for any training puppies). The pads are very absorbent (I'm actually able to leave my ferrets out for a couple of DAYS now thanks to these pads!), made of quality material and nicely sized. I'd definitely recommend these!!"
5,GREAT PRICE FOR GREAT WEE PADS,"These pads are awesome. I go through so many wee pads which gets very expensive. These pads seem to be able to hold a lot of liquid, dry up quick and don't soak through to the floor. Plus, the price cannot be beat. I am so glad I found them on Amazon.com.!!"
2,Lowered Quality for Four Paws Wee-Wee Housebreaking Pads,"I just received from Amazon a box of 150 Four Paws Wee-Wee pads (march 22nd delivery).They are decidedly thinner that any I've purchased before and, therefore, are more susceptible to leakage.I don't know why the company made them thinner but it was a poor idea. Was it to make more of the almighty dollar by providing less? PerhapsWee-Wee Housebreaking Pads for Dogs, 150-PackWEE WEE PADS PUPPIES, Size: 100 COUNT (Catalog Category: Dog:HOUSEBREAKING)Four Paws Wee-Wee Adult Dog Pads, 75 Count....."
2,Quality slipping,I have bought this product 3 times and by each time the pads are getting thinner and thinner. I have rescued a very fearful dog and she is afraid to go potty outside of the home. I have to keep looking for a better quality pad. Sad that I have to change.
3,"Durable, wish they had stickie pads","I have two dogs that share pads. These pads are durable, but I wish they had sticky pads because they move easily. Also, at this point I much prefer the rascal litter box because there are no side accidents."
3,Convienient,"Usefull and very convienient. Wish each pad was bit smaller.Company really needs to work on order absorbsion.Overall it""s cost effective and saves us lot of time."
4,"One of the better ones out there, but not 100%","The pads look and feel better than other pads out there. However, they do leak occasionally. The dog has to pee int he center of it for there not to be any leaks. If it off center, then they leak. Otherwise, they are better than the petco made ones."
3,Wee Pads,"These pads are just OK. I don't find the absorbency very well at all.If my pups potty on the corner (of the white pad part).. it runs outand on the floor... I'm forever washing the floor. And as a comparison,I've used other products without this problem. I bought them becauseof the price... Sometimes these wee pads are just outrageous in price..so I thought I would try these. But when you have to use 2 together,I'm not saving. The larger size pads might be better, but they arepretty pricey. I have 2 Min Pins."
5,SE,We have been using this product for our small dog for over ten plus years with no complaints. It's great
2,Urine leaks through,"I used this pee pad for my dogs to pee on when they couldn't go out and wondered for months why I still smelled their urine after replacing the pads. After checking every crevice of my house for pee spots, I finally got around to checking the pads themselves. As it turns out, they are NOT completely waterproof. Apparently the plastic lining is not really plastic, because after checking the pad directly after a spill, I felt (and smelled!) urine seeping directly through the pad.I resorted to double padding, and sure enough, every urine mark leaves a shadow of urine on the pad underneath it. I suppose it's still a decent price for the number as long as there's a double layer, but these pads are still pretty unreliable."
4,good value,I like this item because its as good as any puppy training pad on the market but the value is great and I love that i don't have to order them as often.
1,Definately not the quicker-picker-upper!,"These pee pads are so flimsy and thin, they won't even absorb the pee from a miniature dauchshund! She weighs less than a house plant, and every OTHER pee pad product we've used, we've at least had SOME degree of success! If the animal doesn't hit the exact center, like a bulls-eye, it's poring out the side of the pad, and down my ""old house, sloping"" floor! I will never be buying this mistake again!"
4,Doesn't leak,My Golden Retriever goes to the bathroom on this pad and it doesn't leak through. He currently weighs 60 lbs.
5,good pads,"I have used other pad in the past and they would leak through or the dogs would go to the bathroom on the side of it. I ordered these pads because I saw a good deal on the 150 count. They are the same size as others and appear to be thin, but so far after clean up I have not seen anything leak through onto the floor. May be a coincidence but the dogs have not gone to the bathroom off the side and onto the blue strips around the side they actually go on the pad.I would definitely get these again hopefully by the time 150 are gone they will be on sale again."
4,Sometimes pee wets floor under pad,"Most of the time they're absorbent, but sometimes the pee ends up wetting the floor under the pad. I don't quite understand how that happens since the pad isn't soaked. Will continue to use until I find something better."
1,Poor wee wee,These are inferior pads all around. They do not hold the urine well. If not disposed of quickly te urine seeps through. Ihave to double them up. Sorry I purchased two cases and not a smaller amount.
2,Disappointing,"Until this order, we have found wee-wee pads to be the best choice on the market -- saving us lots of roll off cleanups. For some reason this batch is not doing the job. Make me wonder if the good price is because these are a knock off."
3,"Adequate, economical potty pads for a small dog","I use these for my paper-trained puppy who knows how to go inside the house when she's by herself and who also knows how to go outside when I take her for a walk. She ""goes"" about 2-3 times/day on these pads, so I change them once a day or so. These pads are noticeably thinner than the Petco pads that I get but they do the job. Although other reviewers have reported that the lining leaks, I haven't experienced this; however, I'm just dealing with a 6-pound puppy and I can see how a larger puppy/dog could easily flood one of these. I'd estimate that these pads could hold 1/4-1/2 cup of fluid, MAX."
4,30 Pack,"At first I was skeptical about these, but my lab puppy went on them most of the time. After he grew a little older, he started chewing on them instead of relieving himself on them :-) They were indeed useful in house training our dog. I highly recommend them to anyone with young dogs."
5,Best Quality & Value Out There,"We have been using various brands of training pads for 10 years. Nowhere have I found a more durable, absorbent and affordable brand of pads than these. We have four small dogs who don't always get to get outside during the day. These pads handle their needs wonderfully, with no leaking through and plenty of thickness to absorb a day's worth of pee stops.Look at the other reviews -- these are definitely the BEST!Wee-Wee Housebreaking Pads for Dogs, 150-Pack"
5,Carpet savers!!,These wee wee pads are the best I have ever purchased - I take in abused dogs who have not yet been housebroken and these pads are fantastic. I highly recommend them!!
4,Does the Job,"Not as absorbant or thick as some of the other brands, but it does the job it is supposed to."
5,(4.5 Stars) - Almost the best I've found...,"I live in New York City, and decided to pad train my Yorkie mix. I've tried several brands and these are among the best. They are absorbent, don't leak, and lay flat. Petco brand is actually my favorite because they are a bit more substantial, but the price and convenience of getting these on Amazon makes up for any difference."
5,Just the best,My puppy loves these pads. These are great. I love the fact that absorb quickly and it helps in the winter when it is too cold to take her out
1,Leak ! ! !,My first order of 150 of these pads was fine and didn't leak so I ordered 2 boxes of 150 pads and they leak BAD !I have used approx 15 of them so far for a 4 1/2 lb Maltese and the floor was all wet underneath so these pads are definately not worth buying again !!!Seems they have made the blue liner thinner and cheaper so what you will get is a product that will ruin your floors. DO NOT BUY until they change back to the ones that DO work and we get what we are paying for.
5,puppy pads,These are the best puppy pads you can buy. I have tried them all it seems. This can hold alot of fluid and you don't have to change them as much. Have a great day.
3,Leaks through very easily,"I bought the 150 box count because you can't beat the price. Not only are the pads a bit small, but they don't absorb much. My dog (a small pekingese) urinated close to the edge of the pad and next thing I know, it's seeping onto the floor and under the mat. The blue outline doesn't keep in the moisture but rather guides it off of the pad. Also, with the other brands I've used, the urine would not spread throughout the entire pad. With these, my dog pees in the center, and it spreads around the pad instead of being trapped directly in the center.Are they horrible? No - I'd take these over a newspaper any day. But I'd much prefer if they absorbed as much as labeled on the box."
2,Thin as paper!,These particular pads were thin as paper! The pee was NOT soaked up at all. I had to use two or three at a time. Very disappointed.
4,Do the job,These pads do as well as any we have used at a much lower cost per pad. We have a small dog that is trained to use the pads exclusively. I would buy them again.
5,OH MY GOD!,"1993 was the year for classic hiphop albums. Think about it, you had Onyx drop BACDAFUCUP, then Black Moon: Enta Da Stage, and just when headz thought it couldn't get any better here comes......MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS!!! Considered to be the best ATCQ album ever made by true hiphop headz. This album packed hit after hit with the illest hiphop-jazz ever for 93. ""Electrical Relaxation"" was the anthem for 93, Q-Tip and Phife were truly on top of their game with this album. Any true hiphop head shouldn't be without this timeless classic, but if you are....COP IT!!!!"
5,One of the best rap albums out there!,"I have always enjoyed ""Quest"" from there first album to this one.""Midnight Marauders"" is tight. I whish more of the new rappers would take there example and get off the stupid gangsta, bling bling crap wagon!."
5,Best hip hop album ever?,"It could be because ""Midnight Marauders"" contains everything needed for a great hip hop album original beats, innovative lyrics courtesy of Phife Dawg and Q-Tip and 5 star tracks. Highlight tracks include ""Stee Biko (stir it up), ""Award Tour"", ""We Can Get Down"", ""Electric Relaxation"", ""Oh My God"", ""The Chase, Part II""."
5,The Greatest Ever,"This album is what every other hip-hop album I own is judged against. It is quite simply the best hip-hop album ever. It includes my favorite song of all-tume, Electric Relaxation. I think that it is impossible for there to be a greater album ever produced than Midnight Marauders. From lyrics to production, everything is perfect. There are no flaws on this album. I have listened to it 13,736 times and counting."
5,CLASSIC!,"Yeah, no doubt about it. I consider myself a vet when it comes to hip-hop, coming up with spoonie-G,The fearless 4 etc... So,when the new schoolers did there thing, this oldschooler had heard some of the best out there. I truly feel this was one of hip-hop's top 5 group's and I feel at lost since losing Biggie and this dynamic three. I'm a collector and have had this albulm copped from me at least 4 time's from friend's. I've since replace it and it's now vaulted. You better get this one before it's out of print. Peace"
5,The end of the hip hop's greatest trilogy,"No other hip hop artist or group have dropped 3 consecutive classic albums in a row. Classic means that every song on each album is a banger or above average with no filler tracks.The brilliance of People's Instictive Travels, Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders displayed youthful innocence, artistry, insight and down right originality.The reason Tribe is so revered today is they stayed true to themselves and allowed the people to crown them instead of begging for the title like LL and JayZ."
5,Relaxe ya self',"Smooth, funky, & dope.A Record that was way ahead of its time. I have owned this for 6+ years and it has never left my CD player. Phife & Tip drop- non stop- with that real hip hop!"
5,Single best hip hop album ever released,"I would just like to thank A Tribe Called Quest for creating this album, and all their other albums at that. Midnight Marauders has made my life good."
4,ill lyricists,"It's a dope CD. Phat intro, I love the way they have their genuine switches that no other hip hoppers can match. A rhyming duo with Ali in the back producing them ill beats, just off the hook. Phife's tight with his rhythm just catchy as all hell, and Q-Tip with his ill lyrics. XxoNexX"
5,Best Hip Hop Ever,Quite simply the best hip hop alblum I have ever heard. This is what made me start listening to hip hop and rap.
5,Hip Hop Perfection,"Hip hop does not get more soulful and pure than this. The Tribe's best work, and truly one of the greatest albums in hip hop history. Don't sleep on this one!"
3,"Not Tribes best, but a good CD anyway.","When this CD first dropped, I hated it. Believe it or not, I was very dissapointed. I liked one cut, Electric Relaxation. Now, 6 years later, I have changed my thinking- slightly. Tracks 2 and 12 have recently grown on me. Award Tour still gets occasional play in my jeep. I really don't care for the rest of the CD though, I have to admit, but I certainly don't hate it anymore. For a CD to be considered dope, I have to like at least 3 tracks, and I do. Still, as a Tribe fan, you have to have this CD in your collection. Like I said in my other review, it never got better than Low End Theory."
5,This is the best album ever made,There's no question. I don't have anything that comes close this. It's perfect for getting lifted and just letting your mind vibe on the beats and lyrics. I've been listening to it for years and can't get tired of it. Midnight is my favorite track but Electric Relaxation and Lyrics To Go are phat too. Man the whole CD just flows. I love it. This is one of those rare albums that's good from start to finish. Do yourself a favor and get it. True hip hop doesn't get any better than this.
5,Amazing,"Possibly my favorite Tribe record. The whole thing just plays amazingly from start to finish. I just bought the vinyl the other day, just so I can have the vinyl and the cd. If you don't have this in your hip hop collection, then you need to add it asap."
5,one of the 90's best,"Back in the early 90's, I was all about the hard core hip-hop. If it wasn't Ice Cube, Getto Boys, N.W.A., or Paris, I wasn't into it. After awhile, it dawned on me that if all these thug things we're actually happening, somebody would be in jail by now. Then I see the Award Tour video. No sex, no violence, no bling-bling. Just a good song, in a good video. So I go out and buy Midnight Marauders. The tracks are smooth, funky, jazzy and smart. Not a Getto Boys hard core, and not a Will Smith softness. A nice medium area that they pull off withour really trying.When it became 2000, there were a lot of surveys - best artist of the millinium, best haircut of the 70's - you know, all that important stuff. In best album of the 90's, I'd always see Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Garth Brooks, or 2Pac. To overlook Midnight Mauarders by A Tribe Called Quest is a damn shame."
4,Inspirational... brings peace,"I am a singer who lives in California. I moved here 15 years ago. Three years ago, one of my good friends lost her 10-day-old daughter, Jane, to SIDS. I could not fly home because it was just too expensive. This past Thanksgiving, I was at my mother's and I found this CD. The medley of ""On Eagle's Wings/Wind Beneath My Wings"" brought tears to my eyes. As soon as I heard ""Amazing Grace"" with it's bagpipes and Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""Pie Jesu"", I knew I had found the perfect gift for my friend. I brought her over, game her a box of tissues and said, ""I couldn't be there for you when Jane died. Now, I want to give you this gift from my heart"" and I sang all three songs with this beautiful and inspirational CD. She said she felt great peace and comfort."
3,A bit disappointed,"My introduction to Steve Hall was ""The Gift Of Love"" which I have thoroughly enjoyed and shared. This has some nice selections but doesn't measure up. Agreed, much of my problem with it is my aversion to bagpipes which he inexplicably uses. His Amazing Grace arrangement (with bagpipes) is tired. Overall I found the CD pleasant but dull. I won't listen to it again."
5,Amazing!,"I LOVE this cd. It is not only relaxing, but it makes one's spirit soar! The traks flow from one to another so beautifully, and I especially like the bagpipes."
4,Deceptiive Picture,There isn't a Spider logo on the blade as shown in the description. It is a H1 logo instead. Solid knife.
3,its a knife,I thought it would be better for the price at the same time it is still a decent blade that pretty sturdy.
4,Great video,"Is a great video. My daughter loves it. Is hard to find videos of this kid's band at other stores. Let me tell you, is a very entertain and educative band for little kids and will keep your little ones jumping around, dancing, learning an having fun."
2,Dissapoitment,"My expectations were much higher for this album as well as ""Suit"".I was expecting a more 'dope' album like his previous ones: ""Nellyville"" and even ""Country Grammar"".The songs aren't very 'catchy' for lack of a better word, they just are."
3,Nelly????,"What happened to Nelly? I LOVED Country Grammer, and Nellyville. He is hot, but just not on Sweat, or Suit. Listen to these albums first before purchase."
3,"Well,it's better than that ""other"" one","Suit is undoubtably the worst album I have heard in age's.When my freind put that album on at a party the other night,NO ONE was into it,not even the little 13 year old hoodrats who normally are just nuts about nelly!A little later on he thew on this one (after I begged him not to)and it atleast had some DECENT beats and got things going a little more.As far as party rap (aka mtv rap)goes,this is about as good as it get's.I give this one 2.5 stars.If you MUST buy one of the two,go for this one."
4,.........................,"Why do people keep writing hate reviews? I mean no one gives (...) about what you have to say obviously because nellys albums were #1 and #2 on the billboard charts. Wow you may hate it, but who gives (...) about what you think about it. It aint gonna change peoples minds about whether to buy it or not. Dont you people have better things to do? Seriously?.... i sometimes think no. Well anyways get a life and stop voicing your opinion because no one cares..... well at least I dont."
4,extremely good for a hip-hop album,"The greatest hip-hop i've ever heard, i'm truthfully amazed. This is an extraordinary effort by the realest hip-hop artist yet. He has got the sweetest voice i've ever heard, snoopy dogg and the genius is nothing in comparision to this guy, this album shows what real hip-hop is all about, i guess. The essence of this album is singing not talking, it's lyrical content may seem a little lame, but nellys sweet singing voice makes up for that also.3,5/5 of all the hip-hop albums i've heard yet, this is the best."
1,Nelly wish he could rap as good tupac.,Nelly wish he could rap as good tupac. but he not tupac. its not even in the same leagure as tupac.it gets 1 out of 5
5,the album of the year,sweat was by far nellys best album of the year. that has well done production. and if you like nelly and his music go cop this cd.
3,afroman disk nov 2nd,why cant nellye combine all these into 1 disk.. just a question. save some money for the customer..peep the new afroman disk. its worth the time. join the streetteam on his website. we need your help.
1,MID-WEST SELLOUT,"Ok I loved Country Grammar. I was feelin' Nellyville. But Sweat is one of the suckest cd i have ever heard. He needs to go back to STL and get back to his roots. It sounds like he's not even trying on this cd. He figures that because he's Nelly we're all going to go out and buy his cd cuz of who he is. Which is why i bought it. The duo with JT was pushing it a little but now with Christina Aguilera? Your killing me Cornell. Anyway, this will be the last Nelly CD i will ever purchase."
4,Can think of a name fo this,"Yo, first thing I got real mad at is the tupac review, whats the big deal? Tupac was great but Nelly is just trying to do is own style, he don't have to make goddamn music fo some goddamn tupac freak who thinks everything should be like tupac. If you want to see the best of hip-hop artists check out 50 cent or Twista. If your gonna be enough of a loser to come on here an bash an artist that rose from the ghetto of St. Louis and continues to support his home city you prolly get yo ass beat around the place.Peace outLeon"
4,Cornell Haynes,"He had two albums at the same time here are the top songs off this CD.""Na Nanna Na"" has a nice party song it is cool.""Flap your wings"" I thought was a nice first single off the album.""American Dreams"" has a nice beat for MCs.""Tilt ya head back"" another good party dance track is ""Grand hang out""-""Another One"" for the dance floors.""Spida man"" has a nice dark beat on it.""Playa"" features Havoc from Mobb Deep. This had a number of smmoth nice dance music.I was just in U-City Library as an election judge.I liked the beats on here.Lyrics 8 Production 9 X Factor 9 Classic 8 Replay 7Total=8 out of 10 FingersHere are the top 5 off this album1.Flap ya Wings2.American Dreams3.Spida Man4.Playa5.Na Nanna NaThis is good because I only heard 2 songs that could be singles"
1,Waste of time!!!,"What is the return policy? This CD SUCKS. I painfully sat thru the entirity of this cd, Nelly Big dissapointment. I liked Nelly's first two releases, but this is no where near the quality. If you have thought about purchasing this cd, I advise otherwise. Check Guerrilla Black out instead. ~~~peace~~~"
1,terrible.def not worth ur $$,"i never was a fan of nelly.but i have always cut him some slack on his songs cuz they r not bad party songs and not intended for ppl that r into hardcore rap.so i decided to download some of the songs on the sweat cd.i was shocked that the songs were that bad w/the exception of heart of a champion,spida man.all the other songs lack flow,his lyrics r terrible,the background beat is all messy.and he has those stupid guests appearing in his songs.i guess if ur some white surban kid who dunno much bout rap then ull probably like this.but otherwise STAY AWAY!!"
1,A Peice of Trash,"I have never really been a big fan of Nelly but today I decided I wanted to buy Some New Music and Best Buy wheeled me in with the deal Sweat and Suit for 18 dollars. Let me be the first to say that I should have left Sweat right on the shelf. If it wasn't for ""Grand Hang Out"" with Fat Joe and Remy The CD ratings would be in the negative. This CD lacks originality n beats are corny Now Suit on the other hand is the better CD and only the tracks with featured artist are good but overall it's beats are better."
3,same as suit,"This cd isnt bad, but its not good. I thought that since suit was so singy, that this cd would be a little more hardcore. Well, I mean with a little more good rap. But its not. I still like Country Grammar best. Playa is a good song with Missy Elliot. Down in Da Water sounds like a song that should have been on country grammar, but didn't make the cut because it wasnt up to par. This cd isnt bad, but if you dont have the money to blow, don't buy it."
2,I regret buying this!,"I'm glad I didn't buy Suit too. Nelly has stooped to an embarrising low level.This is so over-commercialised that it's painful to listen too.I will sell my Sweat CD, and I will never buy a Nelly CD again."
2,"""realhiphopfan""","OK, first off i'd like to say i would never buy a nelly album I actually clicked on it to see all the funny reviews people write. but the reason i'm writing this is because, to REALHIPHOPFAN you say to stop dissing Nelly, and stop writing bad reviews for stuff you hate, or whatever you said. i looked in your ""all reviews"" section, and what do you know -- two of your few reviews were one star. well its easy to see that you're a hypocrite."
2,hey Nick watty 420,if you don't like hip hop and have such a negative response why do you listen to it why do you care. these artist make more money than your ma and pa will ever make and you too. go listen to the soundtrack to brokeback mountain i'm sure there is a lot you'd like there. numnuts
2,Simply Hype: Enough Said,"To begin, this CD is not terrible, but it isn't worth mine or your $10 or more. As I always say when I don't like a CD, I bought this is in high hopes, and I turned out to be disappointed. Though I should of known because I never really have liked any of Nelly's albums and I still tend to buy all of them, the only one that is good is ""Suit"". To me, the stand outs on this disc are ""Heart Of A Champion,"" ""Na-NaNa-Na"" and the lead single for ""Sweat,"" ""Flap Your Wings."" Songs such as ""Another One"" and ""Spida Man"" are terrible, and none of the other tracks are noteoworthy either. Next time, I will listen to Nelly's album on the internet before I buy it."
4,Nelly Holdin' It Down,"Nelly is, in my opinion, a music artist who knows how to give the people what they want. Oh, you can bounce to dis. My favorite tracks are (in order): Another One (oh yes!), Na-Nana-Na, River Don't Runnn, Getcha Getcha and Down in Da Water (isn't that almost the whole album). Least favorite track: Flap Your Wings (I just ain't feelin' this one; but one dislike out of a whole album is not bad). Overall, I'm real satisfied with Nelly and recommend his latest offering wholeheartedly. See my review of Suit, too, if you're curious."
1,nelly,"nelly sucks now, he used to be good. but now he's a stupid pop rapper and he's singing like a faggot. don't buy this album."
3,Reply to Jake Adler,The school system not doind it's job in kids not writing sentences. it's mean IT IS....u meant to write its. sorry the school system this days. i'm 19 and i know how to spell!!i haven't got this CD yet but am just about to order it. i'm sure it's pretty good though if it is anything like his last efforts
1,"amazon, please give us a 0 option!!!!","mainstream hero nelly is at it again with releasing 2 horrible albums on the same day, make it stop! again, i will say that i'd rather play Shaq Fu on sega before listening to this cd, i'd probably choose chinese water torture over this album, anyone with sensibility, save your money"
1,weak,while I respect his Hustle&the Cat has a Strong commerical following this Album is weak&so Predictable. you can fill in the lines without trying. the Neptunes sound tired.the Problem here is that there is no Video of Girls running around when you listen to Him.without the Dime Pieces His Game of Disc gets old very fast.to His credit though he has a good understanding of selling His stuff.
1,One of the reasons I hate radio...,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music."
1,a cancer to hip hop,he is destroying the hip hop culture and is a cancer to hip hop. will someone show him what real hip hop is?
3,Sweat Disappoints but its alright....,"Sweat is the hip hop album with all the guest rappers flooding on almost all the songs. When I listened to it for the first time, I thought this was pure junk but after several spins, it gets into ya. However, no matter how many times I listen to 'Flap Your Wings', it still sucks.My favorites are Heart of A Champion, the 2nd single (from this album) Tilt Ya Head Back, Grand Hangout & Spida Man. The rest of them are just your average hip hop numbers. The Neptunes production on Suit's Play It Off is much better than this one's Flap Your Wings. Just doesn't grow on you. But overall the beats are awesome.I guess this 2 album simultaneous release would be the last time he's doing this as its very dumb and unwise I must say. Put out an album with a mix of both worlds (R&B;, hiphop). If you like Nelly's hip hop side than go grab this."
3,Its alright...but certainly not a classic,"Surprisingly, this CD is better than I expected. From my previous experience with Nelly, most of his songs sounds the same. However, in this CD all of the songs has great beats but as far as the rapping skills of Nelly...it's need word. He needs to work on his voice too. I can hardly understand half the word he's trying to say. By featuring the many other stars on this album saved it from landing straight into the dumpster. But almost all the other rapper, Lil Flip, Mobb Deep, Fat Joe, even Murphy Lee out raps him.Above all, this is a good party CD that can be blast up in your car stereo for a few months before everyone gets tire of Nelly saying Derrty."
3,Average,here are the listenable tracks- heart of a champion- flap your wings- tilt your head back- over and overnelly is hip-pop and we all know it. I gave you the list of the good songs so you dont have to buy it and not waste yo money. You know what to do next.
2,Not as good as his previous effort...,"This one is more like Nelly's style, 'Suit' is a completely different one. But 'Sweat' is definitely not as good as 'Country Grammar' and 'Nellyville'. This is for Nelly fans only.The only good songs on this album are the first 5 songs..."
1,not very good,This video is not very informative. It in no way shows you how to fish out west. I live in Washington and it taught me nothing.
3,"Nice writing, weak story","""The Following Story"" is full of lovely, epigramatical observations about life, language, love, and learning. I particularly liked the narrator's musings on his beloved Latin language, especially when he considers the names of the constellations and notes that ""the blackboard of the sky was inscribed in Latin..."" But the framing story that provides the pretext for these epigrams is much less impressive. The subject matter -- the adulterous affairs of academics -- is such a cliche of contemporary literature that it would need a treatment much more original than Nooteboom's to make it fresh again. Read this book for its language and its philosophical musings, but don't expect it to keep you up past bedtime."
5,What a Story!,"A friend told me, because I love Jim Harrison, Milorad Pavic', and Walker Percy, that I must read Cees Nooteboom. I bought ""The Following Story"". I can't explain this book. Van Morrison meets Rilke. Tom Waits meets Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Bruce Cockburn meets Larry Brown. This mysterious and deeply touching tale reaches heights most only dream of. It is a story of love, questions, regret, hope, death, and desire.Vivillo"
5,Paradise Lost,A novel which brings to mind Cristina Peri Rossi's dazzling The Ship of Fools cannot be too far from brilliant.A wonderful read with depth which will inspire many a return.For readers of Nooteboom (and Peri Rossi for that matter) it appears more than one lost paradise is to be found within.
5,pocket fulla stones,"yall better know that the track ""pocket full of stones"" and ""short texas"" was produced by DJ Paul from 3-6 mafia, if you dont know, peep the underground mixtape DJ Paul volume 12 part 2."
5,never enough UGK,ugk ....what can i say? i bought as many of their cd's as i could afford! i can't take 'em outta the player!
5,Loss of Words,"These 2 are just 2 Trill, what more can I say. Don't buy it. If you do, you won't be able to put it down. The virus is catchy."
3,cat food,This cat food ingredient list had high quality products. The only problem I have with it is that kibbles fall apart very easy. Just pouring it into their bowls made it disintegrate into dust. I kid you not. I'm thinking of moving over to Blue Buffalo.
1,Diamond Pet Foods has recalled this product,"When I receive a new bag of pet food, I immediately place the food in an airtight container and discard the original package. Diamond Pet Foods has recently issued a large recall due to Salmonella contamination, with this item as one of the affected. I do not have the original bag so cannot tell for sure if my item was recalled but the date it was purchased coincides with the manufacturing dates of the recalled product. I am throwing this food away as I do not know if it is safe, it would have been nice of Amazon to notify us about this recall.For more info on the recall,[...]I had just tried switching to this food due to the lower price point. My cat did not like the food so luckily she didn't really touch it. After I discard the remaining 27 lbs in the nearest dumpster, I will be switching back to blue buffalo."
3,Cats kinda ignored it.,"My cats (Male 2 yrs,Male 2yrs, Male 1 yr and a Female 1 yr) weren't very happy when I started to feed them this food. They ignored it at first. They did eat it,but not at the rate they normally eat something they love. No strong smell at all when I opened the bag,unlike other food. So I wonder what it really was made out of?"
1,Where's the rest of it?,"I bought this because it is a classic, however the latest edition has about 20+ pages missing throughout the book. Now I'll never find out what happened to our solar system...."
1,"Content might be great, but I simply couldn't read it on my Fire.","I was looking forward to the book. Downloaded the Kindle Version for my Kindle Fire. As I started to read I noticed that often when I turned pages it was like I was missing some of the words from the end of the prior sentence. I started changing the kindle orientation from portrait to landscape (which changed where pagination occurred) and sure enough, it was dropping out words. It was sporadic and after a few pages of constantly fiddling trying to find out what words it was somehow dropping on page turns, I returned the book. I have no idea if the book content is any good. I have read probably 50 books on the kindle thus far and never had this problem. This book, for whatever reason, is simply ""glitchy"" on the Kindle Fire. Very disappointed."
5,tesla is the man,"this is a very informative book, it is great for anyone interested in this incredible man's life and the legacy he left behind."
2,Confusing and a little opinionated,"Having not known much about Tesla I thought I would read up on the man. I choose this book completely at random. Unfortunately I can not rate this book. I found it tedious to read after a while. This was because the book didn't seem to brighten the man and his works. I also found that the author has a much unbiased opinion of Tesla. I am not sure what the truth is about his life and inventions, but I did feel that though the middle of the book that the author was rooting for him all the way and so I felt I was reading opinion more than fact."
2,"Fascinating Subject, Questionable Treatment","Tesla was such a fascinating scientist -- trailblazing, mysterious and quirky -- that it would be hard to write a boring book about him. Cheney's bio, however, makes a valiant attempt.Her material is poorly organized. She jumps back and forth in time, from the young Tesla to the old Tesla, with no warning or pattern. She jumps around in subjects almost as willfully. Her treatment of Tesla is reverent and laudatory one minute, dismissive and belittling the next.She gives almost no firm dates, so I found myself often bewildered about exactly which Tesla was being discussed. Her description of Tesla's science makes it clear that she was no scientist herself, and in fact makes Tesla's accomplishments all the harder to decipher. And most damning of all, she alludes to Tesla's odd habits and personal quirks, but never once comes right out and describes them.Tesla's story makes for a fascinating biography, but Cheney's may not be it."
5,A Superb introduction to Tesla and his work.,"Ms. Cheney introduces the legendary inventor through stories from his life. Later on, the book focuses more on the technical aspects of his life (e.g. patents).The book is complete with several photographs of the inventor and related material, and it lends itself wonderfully to any reader's understanding and awe.I believe it is imperative for anyone who wishes to know the real stories of radio, alternating current, and the induction motor to read about how these marvellous developments sprung out of Nikola Tesla's creative mind.""TESLA: Man Out of Time"" is quite current, and the fascinating information therein is objective, allowing the reader to form his own opinions.Indeed, everyone I know who was read this book wants to hear more of the man who invented the 20th century!"
1,Could not finish reading it,"I stopped reading the book in chapter 9 but should have stopped earlier. There is no indication that the author can offer novel insights into Tesla, his inventions and contributions to the science and industry of his time. The writing is dry and unimaginative. It is also pretty clear that the author has no deep understanding of electric forces and the devices that harness them. I would love to find a good scholarly biography of Tesla. This book is far from that."
3,"Good, not great","Tesla: Man Out of Time is obviously very well-researched and the author does her best to bring a bit of literary flair into the book, but it still falls just a bit short of 4 stars. While I agree with a great deal of the propositions made about Tesla in the book, and COMPLETELY agree about the radio patent debacle, Ms. Cheney spends a bit too much time overstating the scope of Tesla's work and overemphasizing its significance. A test in which Tesla noted something that might be called plasma != creating plasma physics, for example.Anyway, it was still definitely worth reading, so I'd recommend it."
2,I agree with Carlberg,My title says it all. I just wanted to make sure that there was more balance to this book review.
5,Highly recommended,I was told by a friend that this book is well written and a very insightful read. Looking forward to it and will update after I have finished it.
4,"If you are interested in science, engineering, or learning about an awesome man this book is for you!","Fabulously written biography of a man who deserves more credit than is given to him, very informative and an easy ready to get absorbed into and loose the afternoon to."
4,Tesla Skimmed,"This book did educate me about some of Tesla's life and work. Whether because Tesla was impenetrable or because the author chose not to delve more into Tesla's idiosyncrasies, I was left with a feeling that I did not get the full picture of the man. Obviously, way ahead of the science of his time, why was he so stubborn in his mundane dealings? Why not hire a business manager and concentrate on the big picture instead of getting lost in trying to scratch out the dollars necessary to survive? Why get hung up with Morgan?For a nonscientist, like me, many of the inventions and gadgets and discoveries seemed vague and hard to decipher. Given the importance of Tesla in advancing the field of electricity, the book does serve as an introduction to a much under reported and under publicized aspect of scientific history. I feel that this book is a start to explore Tesla and his inventions and his insights. I would like to see a coil in action."
4,"Dreamer and visionary, Tesla was a unique personality...","A touching and compelling portrait of an under-appreciated, eccentric inventive genius; Tesla was truly born a century too soon. Who knows how far he could have reached with today's technology and proper corporate financial support?"
4,Exaciting at first,"It began really interesting. I was pleased to be reading a well written, (holds my interest), story about Tesla's life. After a few chapters the book went into long descriptions of lectures made. At first these were also interesting as I am Tesla fan. But it goes on and on. Real plowing material. I gave up and went to a different book. Although I do intend to return to see if the story eventually continues."
3,A good introduction,"I liked the book, but found myself constantly wanting to see a more modern take on Tesla. With all the advances we have made in science since 1981 (when this book was written), I wonder what someone who knows more about science than I do would make of the inventions and ideas of Nikola Tesla.Otherwise it's a good, neutral overview of the life of a man who contributed to our society in big ways, and was very eccentric as well."
2,Red dial not white,The thermometers I received had a half red and half white dial. I ordered this one because of the white dial in the picture. The red segment is almost unreadable.Not happy.
3,"Strong Performances, Weak Script","I must first way that I did enjoy this movie overall. The highlight would have to be the performances in this movie, especially that of Brittany Murphy. However, I found the script to be a bit predictable or far-fetched at times. Overall, I would recommend this film, especially if you like thrillers, which I generally do not. There are also plenty of extras on the DVD."
2,Don't Say You're Buying This...,"This film starts out promising: The daughter of a wealthy child psychiatrist (Michael Douglas) has been kidnapped. To save her, he must win the trust of a psychotic teenager in order to get her to reveal a code.I was expecting some suspense and tense moments. I was expecting Michael Douglas--who is a decent actor--to struggle between wanting to help the girl and save his daughter. What I got was very little character development (you never really feel compelled to root for Douglas), and some extraordinary suspension of disbelief:The hard-boiled, psychotic girl opens up to Michael Douglas faster than a guest on Jerry Springer.It's also worth noting that this is the same director that ruined ""Kiss The Girls""--the James Patterson book is phenomenal.But, if you really want to see it, just rent it. There's not much replay value with the film, so save yourself the [money]."
2,Where do they find these criminals?,"This was a pretty typical thriller in that it didn't really thrill. The bad guys were cookie cutter crooks. I think it was the same group of incompetents that Harrison Ford had to deal with in Firewall. There were a few twists here, but they were all forced and predictable. This film kept a pretty good pace and was somewhat entertaining, but it has all been done before, over and over again in these formula thrillers that studios churn out like TV episodes. I guess if you like Michael Douglas you would like this movie, but I've seen too many films with pretty much the same plot and the same bad guys that self-implode to really enjoy this one. Worth a rental."
3,Sean Bean is the saving grace,"I watched this movie only because it features Sean Bean, one of the most talented and most underrated actors around today. As usual, his performance was flawless, even if he was dealing with a less than perfect script. I really wish the man would be cast in a role that would break him through to the star status he deserves.The story itself was predictable, if a bit silly, but it was entertaining enough for two hours with nothing else to do. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it."
3,"Rate the suspense a 5, but give the plot a 1","So, I drew down the middle and gave the film a rating of 3 stars. Unfortunately, the ending was already determined as soon as you sat down to watch this movie. The holes in this movie were so large, I'm surprised the plot held out for as long as it did. Oliver Platt's character shuffled through the first few scenes as if he had no point in the movie and then covering up later to make up for the missing information never provided by the director. One key component was left out completely. You have to watch the ""deleted scenes"" on the DVD to understand.You don't need to think to watch this movie. Just sit back, relax, and let your mind wander. Nice break from a rough day."
