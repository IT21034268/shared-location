2,Does not fit all vehicles,Dimensions would have been helpful. Given as gift for the owner of a 2009 Mercury Marquis. Does not fit the car. Loved the color and the quality but very disappointed the description read it fit all vehicles. I will keep for myself and start looking for another that will fit the Grand Marquis. Dimension are not even on the packaging.
2,Good seat coverage however....,"The blanket covers the entire backseat (I have a small hatchback car), but the suede material attracts hair. By using the blanket I had more hair in my car than if I didn't use it. Also, the nylon material on the underside is very slippery. My dogs were sliding off the leather seat."
3,Does the job,"Works well but I had to buy a second one because it did not wear well. Belts, straps tore off"
4,bench seat cover for pet,"The concept of this bench seat protector is great. It is well made and fits the back seat of my car (nissan)perfectly. The problem is, is that the headrests in the backseat are not high enough to hold the cover in place with the elastic bands. This is a problem because the dog keeps pulling it down. He is a 90lbs. In my other car (suv) it works fine."
4,great item for the price,"We bought this for a cross country trip with our dog (in our little Kia Spectra) and this is great! Shipping was fast and it was easy to set up. Great quality for the price. My only complaint (why I only gave it 4 stars) are the big seat belt slots, there isn't any velcro or anything to close them so there are 2 open gaps for dirt and pet hair to get in there. Overall very satisfied, would definitely recommend!"
2,Bench seat cover,This product is only made for seats that are open at seat bend. Dose not work for my Subaru Forestor! Slides off when getting in. I didn't realize that the roll features would make that much difference .
3,Pet car cover,"The cover has helped to keep some of the pet hair off the cloth seats. However, the pad does not stay in place and if you have a truck seat the cover is very difficult to maintain. If you have a small vehicle, I imagin it would be very workable. For truck owner I do not recommend this product."
3,"Good quality, but didn't fit","I drive a grand prix and the backseat headrests don't stick up far out of the seat. They're wide and are attached to the top of the seat, so the leather straps aren't long enough to loop over the headrests. I ended up just attaching the strap in one hole and shutting the other end behind the seat (it folds down). This works, but the cover sags in the middle so it's not 100% effective.I really think this product is designed well. It seems very sturdy and I have no problems with it sliding on the bottom part of the seat.Just make sure your rear headrests are separate, or are small enough for the straps to loop around."
3,Not as good this time,This is the second Solvit I have owned. The first I had for three years with my old car. It was worn both on the seat and especially the stretched headrest straps. I would rate it approx 4.5.Not this time. New car -- new Solvit. The headrest straps are not as good. Cannot be moved as it is now sewed into the fabric. The seat crack anchors do not work. The dog's movement constantly requires me to fix the seat and lower straps.Definitely disappointed.
4,"Nice, but really requires a back seat with real headrests","This is a nice cover, though I kind of wish it didn't have holes in it for seatbelts. The only real problem I have with it is that the attachment system expects your car to have standard headrests on the back seat (the kind that are supported on sliding metal posts) so the strap to hold the cover up can go around the posts. Unfortunately, my Nissan Altima has short faux headrests that are part of the seat, so that doesn't work on my car. :( I was able to rig it up by running the strap through the plastic shoulder seatbelt guides--it's not perfect, and it sags in the middle, but it works."
5,seat saver,"I've received many items thru Amazon and this is the first product that I felt compelled to review. We (me and my golden retriever) just got back from from our daily walk in the park. It's raining today and I would rather have stayed home, but he insists, so off we go. We drive to the park and walk around the lake and he inevitably finds some goose droppings that he just has to roll around in( Why can't those honkers stay in Canada anyway, I think we're patrolling the wrong border). So many times he ends up wet, dirty and smells a bit. We own a '06 chevy crew cab p.u. w/leather and into the back seat he goes. This seat cover works great. I've had it about 6 months and washed it 3 times and it's held up. I noticed that a previous reviewer mentioned that it slid or wouldn't stay in place over leather. We have not had that problem. Our 1st seat cover was a flimsy nylon-type material which did not last long. This product easily gets 5 stars from us.Michael T. and Sangio"
3,not gray as stated,Deluxe Bench Seat CoverI specifically ordered this product because it said it was gray and when it arrived earlier today was disappointed to find it not gray. It is more of a khaki/tan.
2,No es para todos los carros o camionetas,"LOs agujeros de donde se sostiene el forro protector no aplican para todos las camionetas, no tiene buen acabado, se notan las costuras"
2,Not For All Cars,This slides all over the place if your car does not have the exact items for attaching as shown in the instructions. Mine car doesn't.
1,Two large openings defeat the purpose of product.,This product has two large openings for seatbelt latches which defeat the entire purpose of having a one piece seat protector. A very obvious design flaw.
2,One Size Don't Fit Most After All,Although the product description sait it will fit various cars and SUVs it doesn't stay in place well at all. We have a Ford Fusion which is fairly average in size for a sedan and we tried different ways to keep it in place but it just doesn't stay.
2,Slides on leather,"Quilted fabric isn't bad but this will not stay on my leather seats. Every time my dog gets in the car the bottom slides at least 1- 2 feet. It needs a rubber backing and better clips for the front part of the seat. If you're covering leather, look elsewhere."
4,Works well & great customer service from Solvit,We ordered this for my Corolla. It was easy to install but I was surprised that after my dog was in it a couple of times the hole for the seat belts started to rip. I contacted the manufacturer and they said they just need a copy of the invoice/order and they will send me out a new one b/c they said it should not have ripped. I received the new cover within the week! The cover is soft and keeps the backseat clean so finger's crossed this one will last longer. I must give Solvit credit for their amazing customer service!
2,Back Seat Pet Cover,"This product is made from high quality materials, but falls short (Pun intended) where the bottom part of the cover goes over the lower front part of the seat. There just isn't enough material to cover the front part of the seat bottom, and it also needs some sort of attachment strap at the center of that section. Every time my dog moves around in the back seat, that front lower portion pulls back, exposing the seat to his nails. Needs some further refinement."
2,Do not buy if you have an HHR,"I love that this cover is thick, it is a good quality material and holds up in the wash. I don't like the seat belt holes - dog hair gets right through them & all over my seats, defeating the purpose of this cover. Also, the only thing that keeps it in place in my car are the straps that go around the headrests. The plastic bars that supposedly hold it in place between the seat and seat back do not fit into the little crevice in my car. Maybe it was designed for those cars where the seat actually lifts when the seat back is folded down but in my car the seat back just folds right over the seat itself so there is not the same space in between to secure these bars. Also the elastic does not fit securely around the bottoms of the seats in my car. Possibly another flaw for using this seat cover for certain cars."
4,Windsor likes it,Velcro for one of the seatbelt openings is not there. Otherwise a fine step above shower curtains and towels. Thanks.
5,"Nice Quality, Very Adjustable","This isn't the miracle product to keep dog hair off your seats, but it helps. And I can already tell that it's going to keep my upholstery from getting torn up as well as keeping my dog comfy and buckled into his harness for long trips. We have an Easy Rider car harness that you feed the car seat belt through so that if we get into an accident, the seat belt will hold on to him and the harness will distribute the force safely across his chest.The seat cover has slits in the right places for the seat belt to come through, and it fits really nicely over the seat backs. The best feature is the seat anchors that you tuck into the crease between the seat and the back, which keeps everything from floating around back there."
5,Great Car Seat Cover if you have Dogs,"This is heavy duty enough my two Jack Russells with all their squirming won't tear through it. It also covers the whole back seat of my Ford Escape well with a little extra for bigger seats that doesn't get in the way in this vehicle. It stays put. Oh, and it had to be washable for me to buy it. I always used towels or blankets to cover the seat; this is so much better and at a reasonable price."
5,Quilted Seat Cover for Pet,"My husband has purchased one for each of our vehicles (I have a new Ford Explorer with light beige leather) and the quilted seat cover is on the middle seat. It is wonderful for our little 4 legged girl as she can't make holes in the leather with her toenails and the hair vacuums right off. We purchased another one of these covers in September when my husband purchased a new F-150 extended cab. The cover fits perfectly and easily on the back seat and is a a life saver with the nylon seats. Highly recommended for anyone who has a pet that sheds or in fact, just for the the comfort of the pet.Solvit Deluxe Bench Seat Cover"
4,Quality Product,"This seat cover is nicely made, and has many adjustments to assure proper fit. The best feature is that it has waterproof backing, but the top of it isn't made of a slick material, so my dog doesn't slide around in the back seat with every turn I make. Also, it stays put. I have not had any problems with it shifting around. Nice price, too."
4,Works Well,"The only reason this item didn't get five stars is because it was used. When we took it out of the box, it was obviously a return as there was mud on it. A good wash and now it's fine and serves its purpose well. The extra straps to anchor to the seat are nice, much better than the comforter I was using!"
5,Seat cover for pets,"I love the seat cover. While I enjoy babysitting the grand-dog, her fur would be left in the car. This car seat cover is easily removed and installed. I take it out and put it back in the car whenever Bella visits!"
2,disappointed,Very disappointed...i had it all set up in the car and when they jumped in it ripped up top and now it is nothing but an expensive blanket. i should not have to have to sew and repair. very disappointed
4,Works fine on my leather seats!,"I have a Honda Odyssey with leather seats and a husky mix and a German shepherd mix. I used this in the third row. It was a little longer than the seats and the belts didn't quite fit the pre-cut holes. The belts that went around the headrests didn't have a lot of slack-I had to let them out almost all the way, but it truly took less than 5 minutes to put in, and my dog seemed to like laying on it. My other dog paced a lot and cried and the cover stayed secure. The cover seems sturdy and well-made. I'm glad I got it. I have been pleased so far with the Solvit product line-they are affordable and sturdy. I also have 2 of their harnesses."
5,Works well on leather seats.,"At the time I purchased this, I was skeptical about how it would lay on leather. After strapping it in at 6 different points, I was pleased to see it didn't move when the dog jumped up on it. It is very easy to unhook the top so it can be folded in half and protects anyone sitting in the back from hair."
3,Fair but could provide more coverage,"It has a nice thickness and provides traction for my dog. It would be improved by actually covering the top (including headrests)and sides of the seat. Of course I knew it didn't when I bought it, it was a compromise as others that did provide more coverage didn't seem to be as thick. It could also be improved by eliminating the seat belt openings. They are very large and in exactly the location where dirt and hair collect and then passes through to the seat below."
4,bench seat cover,I am pleased with the seat covers. The material vacuums well as some material really holds the dog hair. I wish there were more straps or fasteners to hold it more snug to the bottom.
5,Exactly what it says,"Excellent product that installs in less than a minute and stays in place for the long haul. I love to take my dogs to the lake and this product ensures that when my dogs are wet my seats are dry.The seat anchors keep the cover in place and the padding is more comfortable for the pups than my VW-tex. Great buy for anyone with dogs, an active lifestyle, and a car that they want to keep from smelling like wet dog."
1,Left Stain,"After carefully washing cover as directed, I left it on top of the dryer for about an hour, waiting for the dryer to finish drying an item in it. When I went to put the cover in the dryer, it had left a stain on the dryer. I couldn't get it out, until I used a brillo pad. I am now concerned that the cover might stain my leather seats in my car if it were to get wet. Considering how difficult it was to get out of the porcelain, I think it would be impossible to get out of leather."
1,Not That GOOD,I bought this for my German Shepard and installed it in my 2008 Mariner with leather seats. The metal gromets tore out in 2 places and the cover ripped. I had to install new gromets but they tore out too. The idea is good but seems to be made poorly.
1,3 parts broke in 1st month (even with 30lb dog),"This product worked great at first, and was perfectly sized for my Audi A4 back seat. I didn't experience the smell issues discussed by other customers. The problem was that at least 3 hooks, and plastic clips broke within the first 30 days, even though my dog doesn't move around much, and is very small. Now this thing is basically just a blanket... which I could have purchased for a lot less money.Pros: Material is thick enough that your dog's paws wont damage your leather seats.Cons: All the material that holds the product up on your headrests is very weak. Even a slight pull will ruin this product."
1,Not very well thought out!!!!,"I purchased this seat cover for my Audi a4. I figured this is a lot easier than taking a blanket in and out every time I want to bring my dog somewhere. Boy, was I wrong. This cover is extremely slippery on the underside, my dog slides all over the place and struggles to stay sitting up. Luckily my grandmother is a seamstress, So I've modified the cover so that it actually locks into my seat belt buckles. Now all I have to do is find a way to keep the bottom half secured. Overall the product gets a 3. I couldve designed a better cover in my sleep. Obviously the person who designed this cover did not have pets."
4,check your backseat first,I bought this without checking my backseat first to be sure it would fit. It has hooks and elastics to fit any car but my Hyundai Elantra GT has seats that sit flush on the floor. There is no place to put a hook or tuck an elastic under. I cannot hook the thing down at all. The dogs jump on it and move around and within seconds the thing is bunched all up and the dogs are on the leather seats. I don't blame the product and give it four stars for my opinion of its durability. I should have purchased a hammock style backseat cover. Don't assume like I did; examine your backseat first.
2,Solvit not up to par,"We had the seat cover from Solvit for 3 years and it finally gave out after our two dogs really used it. They are 88 lbs and 117 lbs. The new replacement Solvit has plastic adjustment pieces instead of metal as previously. So , they broke after 1 1/2 months of usage. They are sewn in so there is no way to replace them.Thank you SolvitKen Bennett, Mak and KoKo"
3,Great Quality but....,"I bought this product online. After seeing the picture of the large dog and the cover extending over the sides of the seat, this is exactly what I wanted. Got it the next day! The cover is too short by a couple of inches to cover the rear bench seat in my F350 SuperCab. My dog doesn't lay in the middle. She sticks her head next to the door on either side so now I have slobber on the leather. Now I'm concerned about shrinkage when I wash it. This would be great in a small pickup or car. In my view the picture is misleading."
3,Works as advertized,Product meets the description and works as advertized; the only reason it has three stars is because the stiching is single threaded - but for the price it works and does the job. I will recommend it because you can get is double-stiched at local shop.
5,Right Pick,"Before ordering I did read quite a few reviews on many different types of covers. I decided on this one and I have been very pleased. It is exactly what I needed. Between the dog and the kids it has been great! It installed easily and has a nice secure fit. I do not find that it moves alot, but I have a Jeep with fabric seats. The size is good and covers the seat entirely. Great Buy in my book."
3,Decent product. Not for all types of seats!,"I have to agree with the other reviews that say the product will not stay in place on leather seats. It only moves so far with the anchor system, but still gives my dog unsure footing and seating. The fit is not perfect on the back of an '08 Accord sedan seat as it has a little drooping and bunching, but it isn't bad and doesn't cause much grief. Other than that, it is a good product so far."
4,"Great fit, good protection for your backseat","This is a great seat protector for your backseat and fits very well. I have a hammock style waterproof cover, but it slides around and the leather in my backseat still gets dirty. This fits much better and has elastic that fits under the bench seat on the sides so that it covers the whole seat (my other would always get pushed in from the sides). However, this is not a hammock style, and thus the front can slide up and therefore the seat can still get dirty. The only thing that would make this perfect is if it were a hammock style. I use both in combination and finally have my seat ""covered""."
3,Its okay I guess,"The material of the product is nice, however, it does not stay on the seat. Everytime our dog moves, so does the cover - at the end it is crumpled up under him."
5,Perfect to save your car seats,"I tried other seat covers, but they did not last. This one is the best, especially for the price. It also looks (to us) much more pleasant than the others. Very durable and easy to install/remove to clean. We have a white Golden retriever ""Jack"" and he loves it. The padded quilting also adds comfort for the dog."
1,dissapointing....,"Bought this as a birthday present for my 10 year old son. This was the only item he asked for. That was June! Still no activity. This is a waste of money! I am so dissapointed in this product. I can't believe nothing happened. On top of that, this was his birthday present!"
3,Carnivorous Creations,"I don't yet know exactly how I would rate this product... the box doesn't tell the whole truth.. it takes 8 weeks for the seeds to sprout, and they must be kept in the fridge. I now have to arrange my fridge contents around a dirt-filled terrarium for 6 more weeks, and still no noticeable sprouts."
3,Seems to have worked for me,"This item seemed to work just fine for me... as long as I have patience. I am NOT naturally very good with living things, but have had some success with these carnivorous critters (so far).got this item as Xmas gift 25th December 2007.8th February 2008, finally got around to ""stratification""- put in fridge.11th April 2008, removed from fridge and covered 2-of-3 holes on dome lid with tape to trap more condensation. -- placed on Western exposure.13th May 2008, first 2 sprouts visible. distinct species... 1 tall skinny, 1 short fatty. --- here I noticed only a bit of white mold, so i did the hydrogen-peroxide bit and the white mold was gone the next morning.20th June 2008, I now have 8 sprout-ettes. 3 of the tallboys, 3 of the fatties and 2 spikey looking little guys.so far so good... but it takes patience.g'luck"
3,"Great Product, but 90% of the Srat. seeds died","This is a good product, but after 2 months, the strat. seeds died. But my Venus Flytraps are still growing which I'm really happy about. I would recommend this to a friend"
1,Nothing,All I have to show after 3 months of following the directions to the T is a pot of dirt with a little pile of rocks...cool
1,"Not a thing grew, not even mold...!","This was a big disappointment. Nothing grew in this terrarium, not even a patch of mold or mildew."
1,Don't bother,"Don't believe the pictures. I just threw ours out after 1 year. Yes it grew - two tiny thin plants about 2 inches high, and the thickness of a piece of thread. At this rate I would estimate it would take at least 10 -20 years for it to be able to eat a fly. Don't waste your money or your kids hope. Next year I'm going to get my son a real plant from a nursery."
3,Takes longer to grow that stated,"We planted this after my son got it for his birthday. I followed the directions, but it took a few months for there to be signs of growth. I forgot about it and randomly checked it it had stated to grow. I think it took 2 or 3 months for the plants to start. It's nice now, very pretty."
4,"Takes a while, patience a must. Will grow.","I received one of these kits two years ago and followed the instructions.It took 3 months for the pitcher plants to sprout, and unfortunately my stratified seeds (the one packet you put in the fridge for 3 months) got destroyed when the container was knocked off the table.Some of them had sprouted, I was able to eventually save two of the pitcher plants.it has been two years and my pitcher plants are just now getting to be 3 inches tall. They have also started to take on an incredible color since putting them under a new T5 high output fluorescent light.I want to stress that this is NOT an instant gratification thing. It took almost a year from the day I planted the seeds before there were any plants large enough to eat a gnat.if you want instant gratification, buy live plants, not this kit."
1,beware,"well after reading all these reviews i now realize i was one click away to wasting 20$.Thank goodness i read these reviews because if i hadnt had my 6 year old daughter would have been crying her eyes out because her ""carnivorous plant kit"" never sprouted a single seed thank you all for the honest reviews i guess ill have to get my daughter another gift."
1,does not work,"We were really excited about this item, but have been very disappointed. We followed the directions EXACTLY, even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks (which was frustrating AND a pain in the neck) -- and still we have nothing growing -- after weeks and weeks of waiting! Rotten thing to do to a kid!The plastic dome is of decent quality, and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller -- worked out much better. This is a TOTAL waste of time and money, unfortunately."
1,Three attempts and still nothing,"I bought one for myself in NY and one for my grandson in CA. Directions were followed exactly and NOTHING grew in either. After numerous emails, new packages of seeds were sent. And we both started over AGAIN.This meant another 2 months in the frig. And what happens? Nothing grew again. Being slow to learn, I decided to get more seeds and try it yet again. Guess what.....nothing grew this time either.So after 5 attempts with new seeds by two different people on opposite sides of the US, still nothing. A complete waste of money!"
1,Does Not Work,"My daughter eyed this in the store for weeks and I surprised her with it for her birthday. We followed all of the instructions and, like the other reviewers, nothing happened. The seeds do no germinate. Even one star is far too generous for this product."
1,Dont buy.. waste of time and money please read..,"I bought 2 of these for my God Daughter and a friends daughter.. They both did the directions as said ( which where stupid, due to having to place some of the seeds in the refigerator for 6 weeks to root.. A JOKE as well) Anyway.. nothing rooted, nothing grew in the dom or the zip lock bag provided in the kit to root while in the refigerator.. WASTED MONEY AND A BIG DISPOINTMENT FOR THE GIRLS... Because of the time to wait for the growth of the product..way too late to ask for a refund.. !!! My loss but it is your gain if you read this and take my advise.. DONT BUY.."
2,A Very Challenging Endeavor - stickers look nice though.,"My little 10yr old biologist basically lived ate and slept with the cool instructions. He read them over and over and over. The thought of growing his very own predatory plants was awesome. However, months later we have grown basically nothing.Even IF it works you are looking at up to 5 YEARS to grow these things. My kid will be in college by the time they are mature.Looked like a nice concept out of the box however, too many variables. Don't waste your money."
1,"If you have years to put into this, go for it","The instructions are horribly written and the picture on the cover? You need to work at this for up to three years to get a terrarium of that magnitude.If you decide to give it a shot, clear out a space in your fridge for it and be prepared to devote a good amount of time to it. Our friends actually do have things growing in theirs, so I believe it is possible. But you have to be very diligent with it."
1,complete waste of 10 months,"My daughter got this for her birthday. We followed the directions down to the letter - leaving it in the fridge for weeks, using only rainwater, etc. After several months ONE plant began to grow - 6 months later and after lots of research - I've determined that we've spent 10 meticulous months growing some plain clover. I'm disgusted."
1,It doesn't even grow,I bought this and did exactly what the instructions said 3 1/2 months later (after it was supposed to be a seedling) and not one seed has even sprouted. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Just a waste of money.
1,Buyer Beware!!,"We put the seeds in to grow in early January 2012, set it up as instructed, even provided it a warm room with its own lighting and it was a NO GO! NO seedlings, NO, Nothing! We went to the company website to order some more seeds, in case it was something we did wrong, and they wanted to charge $7.99 for the packets and $8.99 for the shipping. So, the seeds would cost almost as much as buying a whole new set. Needless to say, a big disappointment. Save your money and go to your local hardware store and get yourself a pre-grown Venus fly trap. At least, you'll have something to look at."
3,Ok - but not what I was expecting,Well - I bought this as Christmas gift for my resident big brained child. He was so excited when he unwrapped it on Christmas and I was too. A few days later we setup time to sit down and get it going - WOW what a shocker - the plants in the picture must be close to 2 - 3 years old - because only after 8 months can you expect to see really mini-sprout like plants nothing like the terrarium pictured on the box. You also are required to sprout some seeds by placing them in a cold environment for a period of time. Its an investment of time and energy - so if you are looking for a quick low energy investment this is not the terrarium for you. If you are willing to follow the instructions and measure progress over the span of say a year or two you are in good shape. For us we are on day 15 - we have a long way to go. In the meantime I am looking for some venus fly traps at our local stores - so we can see some grown ups in action.
1,Don't Waste your Money!,"This was a complete waste of money and a total disappointment. It takes years to get the plants to look like they do in the picture. Directions say that the venus flytraps will be ready in FIVE years! Well, great! That means my son will be 10 by the time it is interesting. Very misleading! Should say all of that on the box before you buy!"
1,DO NOT BUY - Terrible,Put simply this doesn't work. If you are looking for disappointment you've come to the right place! A waste of time and money.
5,Stunning!,"Not sure what you want to buy for that special lady in yourlife? Perhaps your daughter just made the honor role, ... . Whatever the reason, congratulations! Here it is, the gift that is perfect for every occaision, Barbie 2001. Draped in elegant blue tulle and shimmery satin, the doll makes a stunning entrance. Cascading glitter falls from a delicate bow and falls at her feet. Her sheer stole of finest gauze trails behind her and her ""diamond"" stud earrings sprakle brilliantly as all the handsome Kens plead for a dance. But that's just the outfit! Her face, with light makeup and the close-mouth smile truly makes the doll beautiful. Her updo, with its two wispy strands curling down to her shoulders, is set of with a sparking tiara, but take a second look at that chic accessory. What at first appears to be delicate filagree work actually says 2001! What a doll, what a year, what a work of art!"
3,"good book, could be better with a little help","This is a great book. A compilation of memoirs and first hand accounts from German Soldiers who were there. It doesn't get any better than that. In the second half of the book maps are widely used and incredibly helpful. However in the beginning of the book there are no maps. This portion of the book was dealing with where the German commanders believed the invasion would come. It would have been very helpful to have a map showing where each officer believed the invasion would come and where it actually did. I am interested to know how close their estimates were.Not to mention that some of these little French villages are a bit obscure, and a map would be helpful. Don't get me wrong the second half of the book has a lot of maps and is a pleasure to read. A very good addition to any library concerning tactical defense of the Normandy Coast in WW II."
3,A collection of official German documents that present the other side at D-Day,"This book provides a collection of translated German documents that provide very interesting perspective from the German side on a wide variety of important topics (i.e., German disposition of troops, condition of troops, anti-landing strategies, etc.). The problem is that the author really does not provide much, if any, commentary regarding these documents. He presents them in a ""raw"" format. This is good for historical buffs and experts but not very useful for those without such backgrounds. Author's Comments on weaknesses and strengths of anti-landing strategies or troop disposition would have provided very useful perspective to those who are not historical experts on the field.Hence, in short, this book is excellent (4 or 5 star) for those who are experts on the topic but of only limited value (3 star) for those who are not."
2,Missing Merchandise,"When I received the DVD, it was missing the first disc. I contacted both Amazon and the DVD company but I only heard back from Amazon. I decided to keep the DVDs and not order from that company again. Very disappointed."
4,All in the Family DVD Second Season,This DVD is a good product and has all the second season's episodes. No pixelation at all in the DVD and that is definitely a plus since I have purchased some DVDs that are extremely pilelated and had to get duplicates. I have the second and third seasons of All in the Family and am pleased thus far.
2,UGH,"I HATE that you have to select an episode each and every time one is over... I thought it would run continueously, back to back. BUT, nope... Other than that, It is enjoyable. :)"
3,Great Collection- Crappy Quality,"It's not the show itself...I LOVE the show.All In The Family is a classic!But the quality, it's not so good.For a DVD release- this looks like garbage.If I taped an episode of All In The Family off of television it would look just the same as what's on these DVDs.Not happy."
5,One of the best shows ever! Keep releasing it on DVD!,"Yes, this is one of the funniest and most well-written shows ever to come along in TV history. Thank goodness Columbia had the good taste to release seasons 1 & 2 on DVD. Now if they will only keep up the good work. According to tvshowsondvd.com, season 3 IS being released in July. So us fans can look forward to that. Everyone snap it up when it comes out! I feel confident that Columbia will continue with the rest of the seasons, along maybe not very timely. If they don't, we must launch a major letter writing campaign to them and demand otherwise. Let your voices be heard.Long live the Bunkers and the Stivics!"
4,Well-written and brave - classic TV.,"Classic TV. This show may be nearly 40 years old, but, for the most part, it still stands up well today.A combination of good writing, excellent acting, believable characters, absorbing stories, and genuine laughs. Also, storylines that are brave and make you think.It's so refreshing to see a show that's honest, not politically correct, and has a go at everyone, including minority groups. It's also refreshing to see a show with real, average looking people in an average looking house discussing real life issues.Highly recommended."
5,Great Television Program,I now own the first and second season of All in the Family and I must say this is an excellent addition to my library of tv shows on DVD. Who can not laugh at this dumb bigot who defies logic with his silly sayings and dumb outlook on life? Everyone has met someone like this in their life and why not let humor take over this situation.HIGHLY RECOMEND!
4,Brings back such great memories!,This CD brings back such vivid memories of one of my all-timefavorite films and the soundtrack is excellent. There is alittle static at the end of the CD but it doesn't take awaythe enjoyment of listening to it.
5,CHARACTER BUILDING ACTIVITIES FOR KIDS,EXCELLENT GUIDE TO CHARACTER BUILDING. RECOMMENDED FOR PARENTS. TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL TRAIL. IT GIVES A LOT OF EXAMPLES.
1,Sneak Preview,This is just a very short clip. If you are already familiar with Family Guy then it's not worth the time downloading.
2,Seth McFarlane Mailed This Season In,"The Qaulity of the ShowFamily Guy is one of my favorite shows. For me, the first 8 seasons were fantastic, almost non-stop laughs. However, the past two seasons have been a bit less funny to me. In my opinion, season 9 was ok, but nowhere as good as previous seasons. Season 10 was terrible in my opinion. There are very few laughs, and they are usually far apart, which is uncharacteristic for Family Guy. The only conclusion I can come to is McFarlane mailed season 10 in."
1,terrible,"F this entire season. Terrible and pretentious. Oh, and not funny at all. The season started OK but went downhill FAST. Every episode I watch - afterwards I need to rinse my brain out with ..... something else."
2,Did not care for this particular episode,"The animation was well done in this episode but Stewie's trip on mushrooms didnt come off funny at all, it comes off ominous and scary"
2,Lame episode,"This episode was really awful. It was very political, and there were barely any jokes. Seth Macfarlane definitely mailed this one in."
1,How stupid are people for paying $2 for a 22 min cartoon?,THink about it.We pay $1.99 for an 1 hour episode of our favorite network shows.Why would any thinking adult pay the same price for half the time and for a mostly lame cartoon?
5,required viewing,"Excellent! Should be required viewing for all families. People need to lighten up, great stress reliever. If you don't laugh while watching any of these episodes,I suggest you should seek professional help."
4,too short!,"i wish it was a longer preview! they show longer previews on the commercials. other than that, Family Guy rules!"
4,Crunchy snack!,"Like the other reviewer, I took a chance and purchased a pack of 6 of these ""Product of Peru"" roasted corn snack packs. I was pleasantly surprised and did not find my batch to be too salty at all. In fact I found them to be less salty than the original Corn Nuts that I remember from the past. However, don't let the ""Chile Picante"" name (with flames) fool you into thinking that these are hot or too spicy. They have a nice flavor that is more of a ""zing"" on a toasted/roasted corn nut. I shared them with co-workers in several offices and they received rave reviews. I just ordered more!"
3,Way too salty!,"Sizewise they're bigger than Corn Nuts, but waaaaay saltier. I tried them because they're free of chemical names I couldn't pronounce. I would have tried one bag if I could have found them anywhere, but I couldn't and gambled on a box of 6 packages. I lost. These are good in theory, but they're so salty I can't even taste the corn!"
5,The truth about Saint-Ex's disappearance,"This book was published in 2000 by the Editions du Vermillon in Ottawa. It is a remarkable narrative about German pilot Wilhelm von Stadde and what he did or did not do on July 31, 1944. It is the real story about an unusual friendship across enemy lines. The story, at first surprising, becomes quite convincing as we understand that, in the summer of 1944, a lot of German pilots could feel the end of WWII. The story narrated by von Stadde to Jean-Pierre de Villers 1n 1993 at the Saint-Ex exhibition in New York was corroborated and confirmed by Mr. Rudolf Gander, radar operator in Agay on the day Saint-Ex disappeared. This book should be read by all. Ian Cameron III, Ann Arbor, Michigan."
1,Hard to manage,"This switch works unmanaged, but if you wanted an unmanaged switch you could pay less. The web interface only works with IE and not with other browsers. Even in IE it is buggy and either doesn't work or sometimes doesn't even load properly. The only saving grace is the lcli interface. You can telnet to the switch and breakout of the console into the lcli. Which will give you an IOS-like Cisco command interface, but it is very limited and some features are not implemented.Hard to believe this product made it through testing and to market. And definitely expected more from Cisco/Linksys."
4,seiko SG 784,"Everything exactly as stated. A nice watch, a little larger than I care for, but I guess that's the style. I couldn't be happier with the seiko performance & price..."
5,My new staple for baking GF,"My having to give up gluten has been a challenge, especially finding GF replacements for baked goods at a reasonable price. I can now make my own using a combination of Bob's white rice flour along with other GF ingredients. I've made cookies, bread, and muffins and they turn out great. I don't feel so deprived now that I've discovered Bob's products at a great price."
4,"Pere Ubu is more than a band, it's an affair from the start","I would have given this album 5 stars and in fact if you're a Pere Ubu freak like I am then it warrants it in every respect however I don't think that this collection is as 'on' as the ""Monster""collection (also 5 discs). I don't see ""Monster"" up here at Amazon though it's available from Tim Kerr records.Newcomers to the Pere Ubu thing may not find this collection as accessible as some of the band's later albums but either way, Pere Ubu is an education as much as it is a musical experience and I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend that you give this band at least a few chances to catch you."
5,The Best Comedy in Years,Sanford & Son is the funniest thing that i have ever seen. It was so halarious. I really enjoyed Fred and Lamont and all of there silly jokes and what not.
5,I cant stand to laugh anymore.........,"This DVD collectio keeps getting funnier, and better with each new season. I'm glad that this show is being re-introduced to a younger audience as well. This gives everyone a chance to se what ""Real comedy"" is. This one slaps us with 24 hilarious episodes. You know it had to be funny when it came out because there are more episodes on this one than on the first. That should tell you something. This collection introduces us to Aunt Esther, Rollo, Julio, and some other characters that brin nothin but laughs. It's great!!! This will hold me until Season #3 drops. PS.....what about ""Whats Happenin'!"""
2,poor,"Five stars for the show...but one star DVD release, February 20, 2009Like I said this is a five star show. The DVD package is poor and the show IS NOT IN BROADCAST ORDER. I am only on the third season and so far every episode is there, but like I said it is NOT in broadcast order. If you love Sanford and Son like I do you have no choice but to buy this, but be educated about your purchase. DVD's were bought new and skip and FREEZE up due to duel layering. This is our only choice to own...so I bought it."
4,Fun read,"This is a fun stroll through Nascar history with interesting, profane references to all concerned. If you love Nascar you will love this...if you aren't familiar with Nascar lore, its an easy way to learn....."
4,Very surprised that I really liked it,There's no rhyme or reason why this book is so appealing because there's no way to give a description that sounds interesting. A disparate group of travelers sets out to tour racetracks in the south and end up bonding during this journey. No one becomes the dominant character; each becomes likable in a unique way. I finished this yesterday and honestly don't know why it was so captivating...perhaps this is book that will take a while to sort out. Read it...it's like no other.
2,some good parts - many bad,"This book has been out awhile but in July 2010 it was briefly offered for free for the Kindle and that's when I got it. A NASCAR fan for most of my life, I thought it would be a good read. To me, this book appears to be a collection of short stories tied together with chapters surrounding a Dale Earnhart memorial tour theme. That's not so bad except the connecting chapters are, for the most part, poorly written trivia conversations. It's as if the author was forced to do this against her will because it's obvious not much effort went into them. parts of the book, however, are good. If you are a critical reader (I'm not) you might give this a one star rating - if you finished it. Those connecting chapters I mentioned will make you grit your teeth. If you are one of those readers that love to read and can read anything, it's maybe a three or four. No way this is a five star book. That said, the author is a talented writer and I would read other books she's writtened."
4,THE BIG STAR SHINING,"here again, a great driver who worked hard to overcome any obstacles in his way. could have been more careful with the gift GOD gave him,,,his life. but, i like this writer and it was worth reading. dh"
3,Ran out of gas,"I didn't expect much from this book, because I'm not a NASCAR fan. But it was very compelling in the beginning, I was gripped and thrilled by the prospect of an interesting group of individuals on a journey to discovery, and self-discovery. But the story became increasingly contrived and shallow. One particularly annoying development was that the narrator would try to educate the ""tourists"" with NASCAR trivia, but, since they all (but one) knew it already, they would say ""we know this already!"" and then take turns saying what they knew in an obvious ploy to tell me, the reader, what I should know. Maybe if the narrator, Harley, just continued with the narration I wouldn't have felt like the author was determined to lecture to me. In the end, the ""problems"" were quickly solved in a fashion more consistant with a short story than a novel.On the positive, despite the style, I did learn much about NASCAR."
4,Enjoyable,"I don't care anything about racing and had not read this author's work before. But the book was free, so I decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well written and I cared about the characters even though I don't care for racing. I will probably be reading more books by Sharyn McCrumb in the future."
2,obsolete when it came out,This product worked for me as long as I owned a Moto Cell. It doesnt work well with other devices and I always had connection issues...Now it rests in the closet with the other Moto phones...
1,Try some other books to see the COLOUR prints,There are pretty much no COLOUR prints in this book.Try some other books and save a lots of money
4,Ver good cover,"You have to like Floyd and Chillout-type music to enjoy this album. That said, these guys do a fantastic job in bringing the songs into their music style while being respectful of their original spirit.At first I was a bit thrown off bit a few changes in the pronounciation from Roger W and David G's performances but you get over that quickly"
3,Great but too pricey.,Nice quality but I was expecting more for the price. is being used but probably will not reorder.
2,unsatisfy customer,I am not satisfy with this product at all. It looks good but it does not get the job done. I had to go and buy another one. I bought it to press my hair not for its look.
3,Average,Comb only gets hot intermittently. It's not good for straightening natural hair. If you only need a warm comb this would work for you.
3,Hot tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb,"I have only used it twice, so I am not able to give this product a fair rating. It is just okay."
5,Truthful,"My favorite poem in this incredible book is called ""Written Through My Tears."" I relate to this one the most, and I feel many people do. It's a poem that speaks about our feelings through her words, her experiences. I found comfort in this poem. So many of her pieces speak out to me. I think so many people can relate to Hopeless,Trapped, and Highly Overrated. Even more, the poem Home-Less is one that someone living in fear within their home may find comfort in. With her other pieces of real issues in the world, I found myself completely comforted, consoled and content. This book will be sure to hit home."
5,Deeply touching,"The Evolution Beyond Words & Poetry is written by a gorgeous lady who speaks her thoughts through poetry so vivaciously. Her words are more than words, they are everybody's thoughts. While reading the book you'll feel a deep connection to the writer and share her emotions. Her ability to express her thoughts & feelings through poetry is very intellectual and provoking. This book has poems for every occasion, reading a poem or two in the morning is the perfect way to star your day and a great way to end it as well.My favorite poems are Wake Up, Cover 2 Cover & Troubled.I give this book 5 stars because it provokes people think, you feel a real connection to the writer BUT it's not too heavy to read.. the book contains a lot of poems which are funny and not so serious. I would recommend this book for everybody, not only people who like poems because this book actually welcomed me (along with some others) to the beautiful world of poetry. A spectacular piece of art in my opinion."
1,"Vol 1 Ok, but then it goes downhill fast.","I picked up vol 1 out of curiosity, since I had seen all the anime (1st, 2nd, movie, sidestory) and wanted to see how the story was different. Vol 1 is great, and I would recommend that.However, after vol 2. they americanized the names, which I think was stupid. Also, some of their technical terms for driving (understeer, oversteer, etc) in their glossary are lame. Maybe they need to find somebody who actual understands road racing to help explain some of it.Last of all, the scale for the map of Gunma prefecture is off by a large margin. It looks like they gave it a 200km (124miles) scale. This is absurd, since it makes Gunma approx maybe 1000+ km (600+ miles) tall and wide. Impossible since Japan isn't even that wide/tall there. I know.. I lived near that area. Guess it was supposed to be 20km.. that would make more sense."
4,A Great Introduction to Branding,"Duane Knapp provides an excellent discussion of the ""mindset"" and emotion behind building a brand that fulfills its promise to the customer. I have successfully used The Brand Mindset along with Aaker's Brand Leadership in my MBA course in High Technology Marketing and Brand Management. It is full of great concepts and examples and definitely worth reading."
2,Nothing new.,"The book has nothing that branding professionals have not heard 1000 times before. The online ""chapter"" lists to-dos with bullet points. From an average online marketer this task would take appr. 5 minutes. Though, the book has some good branding examples."
3,"A pretty good back for a 15"" laptop","I've had this for about a year and it has been a good bag. I got it because it holds a 15"" laptop well and it has many other storage areas. The biggest storage area has velcro dividers that would make it good for things like camera equipment that you want to keep from banging against each other (although in practice the things I put in the velco defined pockets slipped out into the main compartment easily when the back was open.I'm not a fan of the hard case. It might protect the bag, but you seem to loose a lot of storage space. The bag is not very comfortable to wear long distances, but it was fine for short trips (blocks not miles)."
3,Not in good shape,"Book was not in as good a shape as advertised, corners bent and scuffed. Cover was faded due to sunlight or strong indoor lighting."
5,pure Jack,"I don't have any mixed feelings about this DVD...it is pure Jack Sheldon at his crazy and wonderful best. Jack is one of those rare musicians that can be called a ""musicians musician"". I am always amazed how easily the notes flow naturally from his horn...much like his contempoary, Chet Baker. Backed by a swingin' quartet anchored by drummer Frank Capp, Jack is at his best with his music and a little of his offbeat humor in the intimate setting of a New Orleans Night Club. With this DVD we have a chance to see and hear one of the best jazz trumpet players on the planet."
5,Shocked,It was shocking to read some of the things this man went through. He lived his life with many ups and downs. From start to finish I was hooked! It's a must have!
2,Sad tale of Deception,"Mr. Simmons's story is a cautionary tale of lies and deception. He is delusional about the lack of recovery and involves those who love him in his ""quicksand of lies and cruelty."" He claims to have loved those who care for him and yet he hurts them and worst, expose them to the risk HIV/AIDS with his reckless behavior.I had hoped to read further his story redemption and atonement for those he had hurt that he claimed to love. There is no such ending."
5,great,this book is a great help. it's a must buy if your feet hurt. with some TLC my feet are more happy day by day
5,awesome,this package not only gives you two amazing bollywood horror films it also provides an awesome documentary. now i know to be on the lookout for pakistani action films and south indian religious epics. THANKS!A note to indian film makers - hollywood films are not ENGLISH. theyre AMERICAN.
3,Absurdly expensive,Both these films are available as video cd's on the internet. 21$ for 2 dvd's is a bit exorbitant for a recompressed dvd that will give you vcd/vhs quality. None of these movies were ever released in dvd quality and have always been available on VHS and vcd only. These films are more or less like the cult B grade kung fu movies that go for 25$ for 50 of them!
3,Want to get away from it all?,Ever dream of a more simple life? Do you enjoy movies like Last Man on Earth? Well Doug McClure from the TV series The Virginan made a movie career that started with The Land that Time Forgot. For you submarine fans it's a german U-Boat meets dinosaurs and cavepeople movie. Old story line but well done. It's become a cult classic as has it's inevitable sequel The People that Time Forgot. Another couple of movies the whole family can watch together.
4,Just plain FUN...,"THOROUGHLY enjoyed this old style sci-fi ""semi-thriller"" . In general the whole family can watch and enjoy . Man meets or ""meats"" old dinosauer world in present . VERY GOOD effects for the day . Patrick Wayne does his father proud . Usual ""lost people"" and undeveloped world hidden in the 'developed' world .Dinos , cavemen/women , society as we think it ""may have been"" in early years . TRULY good and classic sci-fi without ""space warp"".Good old fashioned fight scenes , captures , escape , rescue .....Its all there . GRAB the Orville Reddenbacher's , fill the bowl , gather the family and enjoy ."
4,Remembering my youth.,"When i saw this was on DVD i just had to have it for my collection.I have very fond memories from when i was a kid.This was probably my first dinosaur film. I loved every minute of it.Ok, the film is pretty old and dated but it still makes me smile. Some of the acting compared to today's actors is laughable at best.My 8 year old son watched it with me the other day. He laughed but very much enjoyed both films.I hope you enjoy the fun and laughter from these late 70's films."
4,Good oldies,"Both of these films are good quality films that were done right. I appreciate movies for what they are, and these are good films. The special effects were good for their day, so don't expect Jurassic Park stuff here. Overall a really good buy."
4,Scifi Cult Classic!,"This two videos are excellent!. Is a must to any collector of SciFi Movies.The Land of the Time Forgot is a classic of my childhood, primitive fx but if you like ancient classics this movie is for you.People that Time Forgot is a sequel of before movie. I recommended!"
3,Lost Point,"Moorcock said they took the writing assignment because they thought ERB's idea was good -- about an island where evolution goes through all the stages from reptilian to advanced human in a single lifetime. They wrote it to reflect this idea, but it is obvious from the reviews that the director buried the idea in favour of a volcanic eruption and other cliches. Moorcock refused to work on the second movie after he saw what they had done to the first. He understood that they would stick to a script he had done with the approval of the Burroughs estate. However the producer, John Dark, reneged on the agreement and the result is what we now have, still with a shadow of the original there if you look for it. Evidently, from the reviews, few noticed that there was a fairly funky plot buried in the finished first movie! The second movie is typically dumb, written by Amicus staffers."
4,themeatnpotatoesofitall,"I love these films, went to one of them with me pops as a kid, Enjoyed it..Dad loved it because of the WW2 spin to it, and of course I loved it because it had dinosaurs attacking and eating people, doesn't get a 5 star because effects could have been better but are acceptable for B+ Genre..cool Doug MCclure flic he is always ready for a fight (check him out in ""Humaniods from the Deep"" and ""At the Earth's Core"")definetly in me collection sits betweenmy dvd double features War Gods of the Deep/At the Earth's Core and Die Monster Die/Dunwich Horror.."
3,2 1/2 stars for the set up LTTF alone...,"The first act of The Land That Time Forgot is tremendous. Everything about it right up until we get to the island. more specifically as soon as they get off of (or out of?) the submarine it goes down-hill and fast. The naval battles, the cat and mouse between the american and german crews, the navigation through the underground river,...all of it terrific BUT once they get to the island and encounter the first of the dino-puppets it's all downhill. Even if you can get past the dinosaurs, and I probably could have, because I can suspend disbelief to a certain extent for these older B movies, the cave-men.... just not good. In short you are better off with The Lost World even though the set up leading to dinosaur land in this film is superior. Since the cavemen killed the first film I can't bring myself to watch the second...someday...maybe...then again, maybe not..."
3,A great dual film set.,"These two titles, The land that time forgot and the people that time forgot, is great saturday afternoon matinee fare. This film set has an excellent film to DVD transfer and the sound is great too. The only thing missing is a nice little featurette oh the story and script and of course, the actors. What a hand picked cast in both of these flicks.This is a great way to spend watching a dvd on a rainny afternoon."
3,Movie Review,"The cavegal in the movie has makeup on and has the smallest costume on. She is a real movie star cave girl.Decent special effects. A pretty good set of ""B"" monster movies. Just don't spend too much money on this video."
3,Not so hot,A wizard in mind is a good book but not quite up to Christopher Stasheff's standard. If you don't have a lot to do you might as well read it but i'd reccommend some of his other books first.
1,Causes PSP to crash after almost every game,"There's only one way a glitch as bad as shutting down the PSP could get through testing: EA didn't do any testing. That's right, in its haste to get the game out as quickly as possible, there's no way that EA could have tested this game. If they had, they would have experienced the shut down that everyone else has. It is incredibly frustrating when you finish a great game only to have the PSP shut down before you can get it saved. The first time this happened to me I had to start from the beginning and redo training camp. Totally unacceptable. If EA had competition, they would be crushed. But they don't and they know it. They know that they can put any junk out on the market and people will buy it because they have no other alternative if they want to play football. The sad thing is that if it weren't for this major and a few other minor glitches, this could have been a great game."
2,Could have been a great game,"I agree with what the others have said about this game. Very buggy. The worst of it is that the game freezes up and shuts down by itself, so if you don't save periodically in the middle of a game you can lose an entire game you've played. Also, online play is almost impossible. I have yet to connect to someone and get through even an entire quarter. And it shows i have a strong signal."
1,"EA wanted to meet a time to market date, not quality","This game contains MANY bugs. The game will crash while you are saving it, causing you to have to start over from the begining. The game will crash if you get a high score. The game will crash just about any time it feels like it. I have played this game for about 10 hours and have had 4 catastrophic failures.EA clearly wanted to get this game out before the NFL season was over, but unfortunately, that means that they skipped QA.I was planning on purchasing their NBA game, but now I definately will not."
1,SERIOUS BUGS AND DEFECTS!,"To give EA Sports credit, the graphics are awesome, even on such a small screen as the PSP. For the first hour or so, I really enjoyed it despite the constant lag-time between plays and such--then I decided to start a season with my favorite team. That is when everyone seems to suffer from sudden crashes. A bug in the program causes your PSP to shut off. You lose any unsaved info and must completely restart. EA Sports/Tiburon has issued a ""work around"" that unfortunately DOES NOT WORK.I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!! ...at least until they come out with an actual patch or replacement. If you doubt what countless others are reporting, rent the game at Blockbuster. I guarantee you, you'll be glad you saved your $50."
1,Worse Game Ever,"Lag Lag Lag and Loading Loading LoadingThe game suffers from Loading problems as well as lagging problems.Everytime you score a touchdown... the game pauses for 2 seconds and then resumes(did I score that touchdown or not!). Not to mention the time between plays is awful, play control is one of the weakest attempts to date in a Madden game and it is downright bad.The game has tons of bugs as well... the most recent was during draft mode... you can't even read the school names(it is black on black).Did EA test this... How do I get my 50 dollars back?!?"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - Wait and/or Pray for A Bug-Free Re-Release -,"Look, despite the title of my review WHEN this game works - its fantastic. Granted the menu load times and frame rate absolutely exceed the basic hardware capabilities of the PSP - but WHEN it works it is classic EA quality of gameplay and realism.The problem is that it doesn't really work. If you choose to play in ""Franchise"" mode (the only way to simulate a season of play) this game will repetitively crash at the completion of each game forcing you to play and re-play the same game several times ( I played the Chiefs 5x this week) before you get lucky, the game works, and you can move on. Its horrible that EA released this game and I'm very sorry I rushed to buy the first version released.EA's Web site notes that the problem is not widespread, but the existence of a pre-fab response to this bug, and numerous complaints on user forums suggest otherwise."
1,More bugs in a day than in all other games for a year,"Essentially, that's the review. I have eight other games and only one of them has ever crashed the system on me. Madden does it regularly. Now I can cope with the annoying bugs mentioned all over the place, and the slow load times, and frequent pauses, becasue when it works, it's great.But when OUT-OF-THE-BOX, it comes up with a ""load failure"" message and then proceeds to crash on the second franchise game of the season every time, killing the system, this game becomes my first ever 1-star rating.Well done, EA. This sets a new low for production quality."
2,"Fun game, but you never know when it's going to crash.","I enjoy playing this game and will continue to play it. As others have pointed out, it crashes in Franchise mode, and there is also a problem with ""stuttering."" When it pauses in between interceptions, kickoffs, 4th downs and such, it makes you hold your breath for a second wondering if it's going to crash again.I save almost after every score I make so I don't have to play the whole game over again. This definitely gets annoying because the franchise file size is huge (it takes about 50 seconds to save to your memory card!). EA really messed up on this one. Is there anything we, as customers, can do about this?"
1,If you love untested software this is a great game for you!,"With EA's exclusive hold no the NFL license it was a shock that they released a Madden game on the PSP that underwent absolutely no QA testing. A shock in bizarro world anyway. EA did not let laggy play, long load times, sporadic crashing, flickering screens and non-existant online play stop them from releasing this craptacular excuse for a football game. If this game was a football team, then it would be a football team made up of 3rd grade girls.Franchise mode crashes sporadically after the game is over (no save for you!). According to EA support the online mode is really not ready yet, it's still in testing!And still they suxored me for $50US.I understand a patch will be out in September of 2006, but it will cost $50. </sarcasm>"
2,"THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!! Worth 50cents, not 50 dollars!","(Same complaint as everybody else on lag, shutoffs, etc). One thing no one has mentioned before: in franchise mode, when you train the players in the minigames, after you complete a minigame, there is a small clip of the player walking off the field, you'll notice that the legs of the player looks very gross and disgusting (like the flesh had been dipped in acid!). Apparently, the pixels for the legs were NOT completed yet by EA (gamemaker). Very disgusting to see (almost like each player had a million sores on their legs)!!!"
3,"""A New Preview""","This game is the best the PSP has to offer as of now. It's amazing that everyone is already talking about Madden 2007. Just to give you a spoiler, Shaun Alexander is on the cover of Madden 2007."
2,Slow Slow Slow...and Missing Features,It takes an eternity to run this game and you will spend mucho time looking at the PSP's nice screen because nothing else is happening. Also no replay features???? What's up with that!
3,I Have Played Madden NFL For Years,"I Have Played Madden NFL For Years and know that they lack quality control of their NFL products. I could list the bugs I have found in former NFL programs so all these complaints about crashing does not suprise me. It explains why there are so many used NFL 2006 games out there only a few months after the original release. I will not be buying this product because of the reputation for poor QA that EA Sports has reguarding this game.In summary: EAS try putting some time into Q&A; instead of fancy features then you might make something that is worth buying.As a computer programmer I know that many, many computer programming 'geeks' get a thrill out of doing new stuff but could care less if the overall product works. I have seen it all to often in my line of work as I get paid to QnA software.EA better see it and get a clue.Hopefully Madden NFL 2007 will only be a fixed version of Madden NFL 2006"
4,"Good game, not great!","Madden Football 2006, well, you might want to get it on PS2. Sure, this is a good football game for a handheld but it is much better on a TV. For one thing, you cannot challenge plays, I hate that. The graphics are pretty good and it will entertain you when your not near a TV. Pretty good buy."
4,A Living Testimony To The Death Of Melody,"From Summer of '82 until their demise at decade's end, I was able to experience the Dream Syndicate every time they played San Francisco and Berkeley. Apart from being one of the greatest frontmen of the eighties, and a sorely underrated guitarist as well, Steve Wynn was also one of the most articulate spokesmen for the Southern Californian neo-psychedelic Paisley Underground. In Weathered and Torn we are allowed a glimpse back upon a band at the end of its run, due more to the hip-hop invasion that has religated melody to the margins of music than to any energy depletion within the band. Wynn speaks with conviction in defense of his music, yet is philosophical about what is about to come to an end. The 80s were the great period in rock 'n' roll, and this film is living proof of what a band can do when the beats are placed in the back of the mix where they belong."
1,This costs way too much.,"This cd is so expensive compared to the others, there is no point in buying this one. No I haven't heard this one yet but their other cd's are much cheaper and have to be at least as good as this one if not better."
3,Good alternative to tuna,"These salmon packets are convenient. I travel to remote areas frequently and need to have shelf-stable food. I appreciate having single-serve salmon packets because I don't want to eat tuna every day. This provides some variety. I have eaten several of these packets and don't recall a specific flavor from the seasoning. I typically mix this salmon in with other foods, such as macaroni and cheese, or mix in crushed kale chips. Packets are lighter than cans and fit in my limited luggage space better."
2,Careless exposition,"This book initially presented itself as providing a thorough technical background on issues pertaining to the analysis and design of xDSL related technologies. I am afraid to say that it has not lived up to my expectations. This text, for a technical exposition, is very poorly written, incorrect derivations and equations abound, incomplete or absent explanations for derivations seem to be the norm. The authour makes conclusions without justification and leaves it up to the reader to 'guess' for him or herself. Typographical errors are the bane of any technical book and make reading it difficult and frustrating at the best of times. This book has much potential and I sincerely hope that any subsequent editions will overcome its current shortcomings."
3,Very poor content.,"It did not live up to my expectations The first half of the book covers basic communication theory information such as channel equalization, coding, error corection and etc. These topics are also covered so basically that it does not add anything to the reader's knowledge. The second section of the book, DSL section, does not contain any network level DSL access systems architecture design and system management techniques. Therefore, I could not find valuable, practical information for the traffic engineers and network designers in this book."
2,A frustrating technical book.,"I visited this book with certain technical questions in mind. I was offered great hope by its Table of Contents: it certainly looked like a thorough coverage of the DSL technology. Maybe it really is. But the way the materials are written renders the book almost useless. There exist numerous erroneous equations as if the book was not proof-read at all. I was also disturbed by the fact that very few (almost no) explanations are offered after equations, tables and figures are presented or derived. Instead of being told, readers are expected to guess what the writer's intentions are."
1,"Good topic, very badly written","I bought this book with great expectations. It covered all relevant subjects related to DSL. Even the first chapter summarizing POTs cable plant was encouraging. But, the book is horrible. Things are just thrown together without explaining clearly any of the subjects. Despite all the bad reviews you might be tempted to buy this book because there is not another book that covers all the DSL related material included in this book. Don't!There are many good books on communication theory that cover equalization, echo cancellation, adaptive filtering, error correcting codes, noise, etc. It might be necessary to read some of these general books + a simple book on DSL to cover the same material as this book does."
2,"probably good, but putrid writing style","There seems to be a lot of useful information in this text, but to get to it you must wade through a small mountain of transposed dependent clauses, misuse of plural case, typographical error, and generally putrid writing style. It seems the author learned english as a second language, and no one did a careful review prior to publication."
5,Mancala,"Mancala is a game of Marbles,take marbles out and try to be the one with the mast marbles on your side and you will win.Mancala is a game for children,teenagers,and adults,spend hours playing it with family and friends."
4,A great game overall,"I bought this for a 10 year old, who was very hesitant at first to play something so ""basic"" looking. Now though, she asks to play this game over many others. It involves looking and thinking ahead, very much like chess, but is easier to learn because there is only one direction for movement. This particular version was well made too, with large enough ""stones"" so that they do not get lost easily."
3,Fun,"A great and interesting and fun game. It is really fun to play. At first it may take a while to get used to playing the game, but after a while you will get used to it and you will be a pro. I have to admit that after playing it for a long time it gets borring. Although its fun to play when you are bored. Be careful because its easy loosing the peices."
5,Excellent!!!,"It's always been a good show, with somethings some can relate too. I watched it as a child and still watch it at 40. I bought my husband Season 1-4 for his birthday today, and he loves it. This is one of many shows that will never get old."
5,Sexy and Intelligent,"Sexy and insightful. Whether it's a story to make you think, like Wanda Coleman's Harold and Popcorn or a story to turn you on like Shariff Simmons' Love and the Game, Brown Sugar 3 has something for everyone. Keep up the good work.I'm ready for Brown Sugar 4!"
1,A Little Boring!,"I am disappointed that I bought this book, I wish that I could have borrowed it because it was a waste of money. It really dragged on & on and it was not erotic enough for me. I started to read a few of the stories but I couldn't continue because they were so boring. TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING!"
3,You Can Be Emotionally Free,"This book had a lot of insight concerning getting to the roots of problems by probing into a person's childhood. Basically, the book has to do with going back in time in your imagination and letting Jesus heal you at the point of hurt. (i.e. healing of memories) It is full of interesting case histories.I have a serious problem with this book, however. The author describes a case history. She describes how she counseled the person and how they prayed about it. Bingo! The person was totally healed and starting laughing. It seemed too ""magical"" to me. Realistically, there is usually a struggle involved in acquiring wholeness, and to give the impression that everyone can find healing in one counseling/prayer session is unrealistic."
3,"Great, but unfinished","Word to those who have not yet started this book - it simply stops. No closure, no finish. It's like reading a book which has the last few pages torn out.That said, the book really is wonderful.....it's a rare book which keeps me up till midnight on a work night. Colorful characters, riveting storyline, heart-wrenching drama.If you can handle having the book stop just when the main characters are about to ............ then give it a read.Note to Author: WARN us when it's a cliffhanger and the sequel isn't available!"
4,sequel,"I tracked down the website and ..... the sequel to this book, ""Unholy trinty"" is still in ""outlining stages"" as of november."
2,Far Edge of Darkness,"Great book but no ending.The other reviewers have it right! Don't waste your time on this one, you'll be disappointed. This is the second time I've fallen for this authors test marketing ploy. Her book ""Sleipnir"" is just as entertaining but also just as unfinished. You won't catch me investing any more time or cash in Linda Evans."
3,Compelling but Unfinished,"The book was utterly fascinating, with two MAJOR exceptions: 1) Characters/Places changed right in the middle of chapters (VERY jarring to say the least) and 2) THE BOOK IS UNFINISHED! I can forgive the first item, because the characters and situations are so compelling, but I cannot forgive the 2nd item in any way. At least if the book is an unfinished multi-part series, WARN US UP FRONT! I read the entire book (very long too) and felt utterly cheated at the abrupt end which came out of nowhere. I will never read anything from this author again, that is for certain. An I would recommend that others beware!"
3,Best Half Book on Time Travel I Have Read!,"Far Edge of Darkness is the best half book of science fiction I've ever read! The premise is absorbing, the characters have depth and emotion, and the story-telling and dialog are excellent. Unfortunately, the book ends before the story is finished! Other reviewers note a sequel is coming, but I think it fair for the publisher to note ""Part One"" when only publishing half a story.Hence three stars out of five, for half an excellent book!"
4,Interesting.,"I recommend this book to read during a triip, sick day or when it's raining outside. It was well written and while it was correct in historic content, it did not take wild guesses about the time, nor did it use ignorent misconceptions."
5,One of the best time travel novels I have ever read,"This novel is even better than the time travel novels she wrote with Robert Asprin. You taste and smell the past. The characters are well developed. The story is a great adventure. When the second half of this book comes out, I'll reread this one just so I don't miss anything."
3,Wait till the second book is out before buying.,"Good book. However, wait till the second book is out before buying this one. I recomend that you should get both at the same time."
5,A great meditation,I really enjoy this cd. I have just started to learn about Chakra's and the colors associated with them. I enjoy listening to this meditation because it helps me to focus on healing each chakra. I find that I feel very refreshed after using the morning meditation and the evening meditation has helped me to sleep much better.
5,A must own!,"Another must own of the leap pad series of books. This book encourages colors, shap recognition and counting while teaching kids about their seasons, musical instruments and more. On the seasons pages, they learn extra tunes including a little bit of ""The Entertainer"". They also learn their opposites and the importance of being polite. The best bonus is that your child's vocabulary and self-esteem get a boost."
5,Excellent foreign film,"I was very pleased when I happened upon this film while surfing cable channels. I love the grim portrayal of this young man's life and the tense and climactic relationship he has with his father. The harshness of his environment is superbly displayed and creates the needed elements in such cold, dark times. I highly recommend this film. After all, ones character is his most valued posession. How we became the objects of our own character are all stories in themselves."
4,"excellent, IF one can relish in parallels of strange father","An interesting amplification of many (not typical) strong/stern fathers to diligent sons. I am doubtful it will be enjoyed by the masses. I would rate it a very well done, very offbeat, study of (a-typical) Fathers and Sons."
3,"""Slow to Unfold""","A beautifully photographed and detailed period film that is, unfortunately, very slow moving. It really isn't until the final moments that things begin to pick up and the ""mystery is finally solved"". One of the main problems is that the motivations of the ""Bad Guy"" aren't really clear, and this kind of jumbles things up. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and are a very patient viewer, this subtitled film will not satisfy."
2,Dissapointing,"This is a very dissapointing recording. Voices don't match; tempos lag despite being apparently ""live"" and ""fast"". Most of all, the Combattimento lacks any real emosion. Choose rather Alessandrini, Harnoncourt, Christie or Ham."
5,Great for cubes!,I use these around my cube to hold pictures and messages. I love how easy it is to swap out photos and how secure items are once put in place.
2,Another disapointing book.,"This book should be titled ""Video Astronomy in the Suburbs"" because the author mostly promotes the use of low-light cameras similar to the see-in -the -dark military sniper or hunting scopes. If you want to look at the green screen of a light amplifier instead of putting your eye to the scope,then this is for you.I am finding the Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy books to be practically useless,sad to say.Save your money ."
3,Good Product & Return Policy,The product was not the type my father could use but Roho was good in exchanging it for another one of theirs.
4,Scooby doo-missing donuts,"I read the other reviews before buying this book and was actually a little disappointed. It was the first Leap pad book we bought and was expecting more activities. I found the book short, it is just the story. My Daughter does enjoy the story and finding the missing paw prints."
5,A must have,"O.K so the story isn't great but it is well geared to it's target audience. The book is fun, and the games are great. The games seem to concentrate on developing good listening skills which as any parent knows this is a great skill to develop! This book also has a memory section and quite a complicated game where the kids have to answer questions by pressing A,B,or C. For this game they have to focus hard on remembering the question and which answer applies. Although it is well hidden from the kids the book is very educational and a whole heap of fun."
5,love that leap pad,Alex got this for his birthday and it was the ONLY thing he wanted to pay with for the rest of the day!
5,Great start for learning to read,"My daughter, now seven, is in an advanced reading class. I thnk part of that reason is we encourage her to read and a big part of that was her using the leappad. This was one of many ""books"" that has helped to fuel her joy of reading. Plus, I get a kick out of the fact that I grew up enjoying Scooby Doo cartoons and now my daughter likes Scooby too."
2,Not very durable,"A very basic TV/VCR, which is fine for use in the car. I've enjoyed the TV when it actually worked, but the DC converter and the VHS player have quit on me on separate occasions. I would recommend another (hopefully more reliable) model."
4,Funny but huh?,"Gerard Depardieu is married to an unresponsive woman; thinking a lover might help cheer her up, he gets her one. When this doesn't work both men come to the conclusion that having a baby would do the trick. But this too fails. At end only a 14-year-old boy brings her out of the doldrums--and gets her pregnant. Highly improbable, but very funny. Won an Academy Award."
4,I am very confussed,Try as I might I will never understand french humor. Yes this movie was funny and yes the acting is excellent don't get me wrong but come on the whole 12 year old kid suducing a grown women thing??? I don't understand maybe I just don't think very deeply.
5,Singin' in the Rain...in A Flat...,This is one of the best soundtracks ever! It takes a classic movie and puts all of it's best music on one disc!
1,Big disappointment,audio -horror music--horror in garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!$30.00 wasted! we love music have the original on the above on cassette plus the show on vcr just wanted to update on cd
1,Ridiculous.,"What good is a soundtrack of Singin' in the Rain without taps? For goodness' sake, that's what the whole movie was about. Lost is a beautiful artistry of Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly, in favor of bland music that was meant to serve only as a background for their talents. Their rhythms were what brought out the best in the dance numbers, not the dumb orchestra! Boooo."
5,Gotta love Singing in the Rain,I had this album in my cart at iTunes waiting to buy and before I decided to buy (a few weeks later) you could no longer get the album you had buy songs only and some of the songs came up missing. I checked with Amazon and I could get the whole album cheaper than they had it listed at iTunes if I bought all the songs and Amazon had all the songs included in the album price. So... there you go.
3,Interesting and easy to listen to,"You will like this if you're a fan, but the sound quality is not that good - after all it was not a planned recording, it just happened.Interesting selection of songs, and Happy really is an amazing performer."
3,Can pass on this unless your child is a winnie the pooh fan,"This one has a rather sad story where tigger gets into trouble with bouncing, ending up stuck in a tree with baby roo. The story ends with rabbit gloating over him and wanting him to stop bouncing for ever after tigger is rescued. So, my 2 year old never wants to finish reading this story, its just too too sad! He likes the pooh bear story much better! Not too mqny activities and games either on each page"
1,Not What You Think It Is,"This album [stinks]! It is not the original recordings, hard to tell if it's even the original artists. Sounds like bad live performances done decades after the original songs were recorded. Not at all what I expected."
5,This TV Rocks,"There are many small details that make this versatile TV a joy to own. It has a handle on top so is easy to carry from room to room. Tons of inputs, (3 standard inputs + 2 HDMI inputs + a VGA input) and one of the HDMI inputs has an optional audio in which means it plays nice with my DVI Mac Mini. The Sharp remembers the volume level for each input, and an optional audio out can be controlled with the TV volume as well, so it is easy to connect either external speakers or headphones to this TV. It is the perfect size for a bedroom TV or an external monitor for a laptop. The power button, input selection button, and channel up/down buttons are conveniently located on the top of the unit, putting them out of the reach of my toddlers and making it easy to do most things without the remote control."
5,Sharp LC20D42U,"Very clear picture. Neat in appearance. Mounted on wall bracket. Very satisfied with price, quality and speed of delivery."
4,One of Hawaii's best loved comedians....,"Rap Replinger along with many comedians like Andy Bumatai and Frank Delima...Rap's comedy humor will always live on and on...To really understand Rap's humor you would have to be from Hawaii or lived there a couple of years. My favorite tracks on the album is the unforgettable track ""The Hypnotist"" and ""Aunty Marialani Cooking Show""....not toooo sweet...not tooooo rancid......but juuuusst right......okey dokey.... And Ahem!!! ..."
5,Value education. A book on Education's restoration of Value.,"Soka means Value. This book teaches the great importance of human interaction and relationship between the mentors and mentees of today's academic institution. Soka Gakkai President Ikeda strongly encourages the reader to understand that the value of Education as for others to learn and benefit from that which they learn. He expounds the one truth of Students to respect their teachers for their inputs just as teachers respect their students for their efforts. Mr. Ikeda distinctly explains the necessary steps and practice to keeping Value in education, as he is inspired by his mentor Josei Today, and the first president of Soka Kyoiku Gakkai, Mr. Makiguchi who was a humanistic educator and a strong advocate for peace. Purchase this book today and find great value in teaching others in all aspects of life, not just in schools but in all institutions of society. Go Soka!"
4,MUTANTS VS. ALIENS,"This could be the most bizarre pairing in the history of the MIDNITE MOVIES double feature series. INVASION OF THE STAR CREATURES is basically a goofy kid movie, full of silly gags and slapstick. G-rated fare. INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS is an early 70s cult / soft core movie about mutant bee-babes that kill men through lethal shagging. Loaded w/ nudity and marshmallow creme, the bee gals are certainly adult friendly, but you might want to send the kids to bed! Interesting match-up..."
3,"STAR CREATURES ... ""CUT"" VERSION!!!!!!!","The ""....Bee Girls"" was one of those ""C"" drive-in movies that we went to see as teenagers just because it was R-rated and there were nude women in it. The story is terrible (obviously) and the only reason you would probably want to see this movie again was because it brought back memories of going to the drive-in with your friends. The movie I wanted was STAR CREATURES and was dissapointed that some of the scenes were cut. I'm not sure why they cut them out, but, oh well! The only thing that salvages this DVD release is that STAR CREATURES is in it's original wide screen version. Made from a good quality print, too!!"
2,Puzzling choice for double-feature...,"I don't know why these 2 films were put together on a disc. ""Star Creatures"" is totally silly, suitable for young kids because of the idiot behavior of its loveable, albeit hammy, pair of goofballs. ""Bee Girls"", on the other hand, has equally low production values, more of an exploitation film, so prevalent in the early 70's. It doesn't stink, but doesn't provoke any intelligent thoughts, either. The pre-occupation with sex would definitely not be suitable for kids (though little kids know everything, anyway...) If kids need to see a pre-occupation with sex, let them see ""Tom Jones"". At least it's an excellent adaptation of a classic, and has no crude nudity. These 2 films, on one DVD, lack any discernable comparison...except that both are below avarage."
5,Deeply personal and moving,"Gary Comstock was the first openly gay man to be appointed as a chaplain at a major US university (Wesleyan Univ., in Connecticut). Although Comstock's background is in academia rather than churchwork, this book is hardly ""academic"" in the derogative sense. It is deeply personal and moving, yet managaing to be relevant to the average reader. For anyone who has questioned their faith because of the prejudice and intolerance in Christianity, I would recommend this book. It makes no apology for the intolerance of the Bible, but somehow managed to be all the more spiritually comforting. Anyone, queer or straight, will find guidance here."
2,Good Premise but just not enough,"I wanted to like this book and the main character. The plot-Ginger takes her mom, her mom's friend Iffy, and Iffy's niece to the Philadelphia Flower Show where Iffy is one of the top competitors. Iffy turns up dead and it becomes a whodunit.Everything was okay. I never felt as though we got to know the main character Ginger. In addition, the author introduced several characters which were never developed like Iffy's niece. Overall, the book was slow."
5,An Original Vampire Tale,"Jack Pantaleo has crafted an original horror story, that of a Christian vampire, Lesbiana, who tries, throughout Mother Julian and The Gentle Vampire, to find some way of redeeming herself. Pantaleo illustrates in an easy-to-read and entertaining fashion how good and evil are closely related. After reading the book, I was struck with his exploration of how good and evil exist on the same continuum, so that at some point the two forces intersect, and the way in which Pantaleo arranges for them to meet is intriguing. He has given us the gift of an ethical vampire, Lesbiana, we can sympathize with. The story is replete with spiritual themes, rarely covered so creatively in a typical vampire tale. Don't miss reading Mother Julian. I truly enjoyed it!"
2,Not very impressive,"This game is a pain. If you are a collector it would be worth it, but otherwise - don't bother. It is designed as a multiple player game, but the area is too small for people to ""buzz in"" to answer the questions as you are supposed to. You have to type in question codes and it times out after a few seconds. It is annoyingly complicated. The area behind Homer is cardboard and can easily bend or rip off. If the game were simpler to use and the console a little bigger, it would be alot more fun to play. Basically, it isn't designed well. The sayings are fun, but if you want a trivia game just get the trivia tin."
2,"We said meh, M-E-H.","This game is good for collectors but not for Simpsons fans looking to show off their knowledge. There are too many buttons and it's just not that fun. I wasn't impressed with the cardboard behind Homer, either."
2,It is interesting when you get it.,"If you collect, then you will have this. If you are looking for a trivia game, this is not fun. All the button pushing makes it boring really fast. The questions are ok and I had to think on some of them. But the button pushing!My 2 year old likes the sounds it makes."
3,It's good for collector.,"Obviously, stuffs in this series are not much educational. However, this item looks good on your shelf. Also, its good tricks are not bad at all....I personally think it's worth it."
5,Reverend A.A.M. Review,Lord have mercy it took me forever to find which Native Spirit this is.Thank You Thank You!!!This CD! has change! my LIFE!!!!!!!! Thank you!! for the Music!!!!God Bless you all! Thank you for Everything !!!!Buying this CD ASAP!!!!!!!!!A MUST!
4,Seems to work well,"I tried this product to whiten my teeth before the wedding. It seems to be better than most products that I've used in the past. Quite a few people, including my fiance, have noticed a difference. However, I'd recommend getting the 20 ampule solution. There's no need to pay the extra to get the toothpaste. Also, this version only has 27 ampules, not 30 as advertised."
4,not highly technical but highly encouraging.,"a volume that preaches to the choir of masters (and would be) swimmers. discussions of benefits of swimming, weight loss, strokes, masters swimming & more. maybe the best starter book available for someone interested in getting started in swimming. not bed for those of us in it, but not as informative for stroke technique as other volumes. loses ponts on the one to ten scale due to lack of technical improvement information"
2,"Little about swimming, a lot about everything else","Why are swim book authors so lousy? This one is worse than the Total Immersion book. More pages are devoted to topics around swimming than swimming itself. There are chapters on health, diet, etc. etc. That's not necessarily bad, but I'd rather have a smaller, more focused book just about swim technique. In addition, the author gets carried away with love of his sport, asserting that swimming will lead to a better sex life, longevity, wealth, world peace. Well, many fitness regimes will improve your health. Buy it used and keep your expectations low."
1,this book is worthless,"The first 86 pages do nothing but tell you why you should swim. If you didn't want to swim why would you have the book to begin with? I am starting triathlons and the only reason I want to swim is to get to T1. After a few moderately useful pages explaining the basic strokes (which you can find better descriptions and pictures on the web) the rest is MORE WORTHLESS FILLER. ""How swimming improves your sex life""? Common, WORTHLESS, WORTHLESS, WORTHLESS."
3,Very thorough resource...,"This book is just what it is called: an atlas. It does not give advice or information about irish history, genealogy, or anything of the sort (which is what I had mistakenly hoped for). It is a very, very detailed atlas of the counties, parishes, and every other conceivable subdivision of the land of Ireland over the last 200 years. It could be a valuable resource for anyone who has their genealogical research within Ireland already. If you are like me, and have traced the family to the boat ride but no further, this will not help you quite yet.Thank you still to the author for the extensive research that must have gone into this!"
4,Fantastic Irish Genealogy Tool,"Very easy to read maps, great helper when your trying to figure out Baronies, Poor Unions and Parishes for anyone whether starting or revisiting their Irish genealogy projects."
4,Great Research tool for those looking for their ancestors in Ireland,I've been researching for many years and have checked a lot of the records in Ireland online. This book is comprehensive and a good reference for all the parishes and divisions of this wonderful Country.
5,review order,Ordered and received book in excellent condition. This is great for anyone working on their genealogy in Ifreland. Was very helpful before my trip to Ireland.
2,24 Short Concert Pieces for Flute and Piano,"The book received was in very nice condition as was stated by the seller and was mailed quickly. Unfortunately, the second book to the set was not included. The seller states in the title that the book sent is the flute score which was incorrect as it is the piano score, the second book in the set is the flute score book. I should have asked the seller if both books were included instead of assuming that they were."
5,Book itself is excellent,"This book is a FANTASTIC collection of classic intermediate flute repertoire. It's my favorite book in my library, and I highly recommend it.But 90 dollars? Come on, people. Sheet Music Plus is selling it for 21."
4,A story that stays with you,"I read this very, very good book a year ago and came back to Amazon to get the next one from this author. Thought I'd write a review here because I still think about this book and the previous one in this series. I find myself wondering how these characters are doing now, that's how real they became to me. The themes of justice and injustice are handled in a way that's relevant to what's going on in the world right now."
1,"This movie is cheap boring,childish and tragic dont buy it !","I am sorry I bought this movie! The acting is very bad,the quality of the filming is very poor. The story line is totally crap. This is obviously a trip into Alexis Arquette's narcistic childish fantasy.... like grow up!. The title of the movie is great, thats what sucked me in.The film quality is ""home movie"" quality, the DVD and jacket look like it was ""knocked up"" on someones home computor. The dialogue is so imature and very unfunny,a couple of two year olds dressed in mommy's clothes could have done better. Destined for the trash can Im afraid! Dont buy it and waste your money. Dont say I didnt warn you.The money spent making this movie is a complete waste, Id rather give the money spent making and producing this movie to homeless bums.C.Redding Australia"
4,Something new and something old!,"Well l'd love to say that this one is up there with the best of em', but at the end of the day l guess l have to sit here with my subjective head on and say that the album was full of very very good tracks, but no great one's in that nothing sonically new is offered to the listener. Every track is made up from tried and tested musical methods both in terms of the writing and the sound pallet used. However it is that same said familiarity which l'm sure will endear this recording to fans of Schmoelling and T.D. alike. Johannes has not redefined his sound, but compounded it to great effect and l myself would not be without this album for one second as repeated listens prove that the 74min playing time just sails by time and again!!! This is an album that delivers where others have failed. Am l disappointed by this latest release? Not one jot!! The big question now has to be when and will we ever get another solo effort from this musical enigma???"
2,weak,"Not a true example of the Columbus hip-hop scene or Ohio's. Played out themes taken from west-coast funk with no reigonal influence or style.The ""O"" has a large music influence nation wide,and CO's ""finest"" just didn't bring it."
5,WOW,This punch is the cats meow. It is the Cadillac of hole punches. clean straight effortless holes in 25 plus sheets at a time. Great Investment for me over the one I was using that the handle is the same size as the base (no leverage). This punch can be used with one hand. Love it.
4,Great sheet capacity and lever arm,"The long lever arm on this hole punch makes punching large amounts of paper very easy. Also, there are fewer moving parts on this design than on others I have seen. Fewer parts generally means less to break. The paper size is not adjustable, which is fine for me since I only ever punch 8.5 x 11 sheets. If you need to punch a variety of sizes this is probably not the one for you."
4,Works fine,So far this seems of good quality. My wife the school teacher likes it and hasn't had any problems. So far she generally does punch more than 22 pages at a time.
5,Love it!,Wonderful hole punch. Extremely heavy duty and worth every penny! Would definitely recommend for purchase.
5,Works great,We purchased this 3 hole punch for our office. It is very heavy duty and works great. The last hole punch we had fell apart The capacity on this punch is at least 40 sheets and works great!!
2,scientific data on polonium,I have not purchased this yet but I felt it was important to inform Encarta that their data on polonium on the Encarta web-site is incorrect and could prove very misleading to young scientists looking for information.There are so many errors that I do not wish to list them - suffice to say that they should urgently get a nuclear scientist to review this data and make the necessary corrections. Perhaps they have already done so in this premium version but if they have they should also correct it on the Encarta web-site.Best wishes.Savio Sequeira PhD Radiological Protection Institute of IrelandScientific Officer 3 Clonskeagh SquareClonskeagh RoadPhone: (personal) -353-1-206-6914 Dublin 14(switchboard) -353-1-269-7766Fax: -353-1-269-7437 Irelande-mail: ssequeira@rpii.ie
2,Not so Good,"The production on this was pretty bad. The angle shots of where she is placing her fingers was horrible. You could barely see where she was placing her left hand. The shots were from the side instead over on top where most instructional DVD's show the hands. She would give you little song examples but there was no notation of any kind of what she was playing. It was pretty bland in my opinion. Concept of what she is trying to teach is solid but yet not that instructional. I understand what she is saying, it just needed a more modern approach and additional material. After listening to her talk for about 10 minutes, I was ready to fall face forward into a deep sleep."
2,Hum Drum,"While I consider myself a spiritual person, I felt this dragged on and on. Yes, thought provoking, but maybe my mind just needs more background stimulation as well. On screen is nothing but the 2 men for the most part. While the camera is on one, you can see the other in a tv screen, behind or alongside of the one speaking. Once in awhile, other pictures will be shown, but nothing to really 'interest' the eye/mind while they go back and forth with their discussion. I realize the 'meat' of the dvds IS the two men and their discussion, but at times it was boring for me, like sitting in a classroom with no 'outside' stimulation for hours and hours."
2,Technically very poor quality recording,"It's a pity the record label didn't take any more pride in their work than they did. I recommend the DECCA recording of Burl Ives Greatest Hits as a worthy susbsitute. I've yet to locate a CD with the one song of Burl Ives for which I am searching... Buckwheat Cakes (Buckwheat Cakes, along with crispy bacon. Yes it is your buckwheat cakes that sets my heart to achin')"
2,Poor quality detracts from Ives performance.,"This CD is subtitled ""The Concert Collection"" and is mostly live recordings. Unfortunately the quality of many of the tracks is very poor, especially ""Funny Way of Laughing"" which is my favorite Burl Ives Song. I do not recommend this CD"
4,My Opinion Of Burl Ives,"I became familiar with a BurlIves song back in the '70's and although I am not a perticular fan of the man as a singer I am still rather partial to the song ""A Little Bitty Tear Let Me Down"". When I first heard it, I had just gone through a rocky ending of a bad relatinship, and the words just seemed to say a lot of the things I was too inarticulate to put into words. Maybe, if I could have said what he said in that in that song, I could have salvaged a relationship that still haunts me as a dismal failure. Burls' songs are obviously mant to appeal to a wide audience and I am sure that if you give all of them a fair chance you will be somewhat surprised (and maybe even delighted) aat the things you hear. Above all, please try to remember that Burl Ives was an actor, not a singer. But he was still able to put forth a lot of entertainment as a singer also. (AT LEAST TO SOME OF US)"
5,Scraight Crunk!!!,No doubt...this man has the beat...and the sound we all look for when we wanna groove. He does it in his own style too which is hard to find in the rap industry anymore!...Props to him and all his efforts...Hope to see alot more of him real soon.
2,eminem wannabe,aja west is trying to copy eminem and isn't doing too good of a job. his songs are ok. this cd is good if you like the underdogs.
5,Funny Money....a book about finances that won't put you to sleep,"I am a 19 year old high school graduate. I was given a copy from my boss, a commercial realtor. I have to admit that when I read the cover, I laughed inside. I'm 19 like I care about money markets, stocks, bonds, IRA's, and 401k's. All this is like a foreign language to someone my age...and it is a language few can help us decipher. Peter Bielagus is one of those few translators. He does it in a poignant and humorous manner that made it hard for me to put down. I intend to make sure that everyone I know has a copy of this hilariously and helpful guide to finances. Peter finally proves that money can be fun. Go out and get yourself a copy today it's a must have for young adults and a should have for every other age group"
4,Worth reading,I like the breezy quick style of this book. It is actually sort of fun. There are a lot of good practical ideas in the book. I think it is a worthwhile read for a young person wanting to get his or her financial house in order.
4,Solid Financial Advice for Any Beginner,"Getting Loaded is packed with practical advice that everyone with an interest in financial stability and independence should be accustomed to. The information is not complicated and represents only a beginner's guide to the financial world, but lack of the the knowledge in this book would leave one with a rather shaky financial foundation.The chapters include the fundaments of money management, credit, insurance, investing, and the essentials of personal money matters. The content is geared towards a beginner, thus those with general knowledge in these areas will find little new on these topics; however, as an introductory book on personal finance, I would happily recommend this book to anyone including my own child."
5,Excellent Book - Great Gift for a Recent Grad,"This is an excellent book. This book is a perfect gift for a recent college graduate. The author explains the basics of personal finance and provides solid advice to someone just starting out. The material is presented in a way that makes it engaging for someone who is not all that interested in finance, saving money, etc."
1,Stay far far away...,"It's terrible... I have to read this book for a sociology examn and it's a disaster. Often one sentence goes over more than ten lines and a paragraph over a page :( by the time you get to the end of a sentence, you've forgotten what the beginning was about. And there are so many complicated words. If you have a choise, don't choose this one."
3,Cool....if you know nothing about hiphop,"OK, here's the problem in a nutshell.If you know nothing about hiphop, this book is a winner because it gives good historical overviews on many issues. If you are an aficianado, then you will be looking for some in-depth analysis. In this book, there is none of that. It seems like George is making an attempt to keep the book short and does not making any hard-hitting or unique analyses. Extend this, and then he'll possibly make an impact."
4,STILL USEFUL,"I read this book when it first came out, and from the onset I realized the book was flawed by Mr. George's ego. Mr. George has great thoughts and opinions, but unfortunately, he allows personal biases to mar how presents them to his readers. Like one of the other reviewers, I didn't agree with a lot of what he wrote, but it is still useful for information about the early days of hip hop."
1,superficial cut and paste job,"If you are looking for a well researched historical or musical analysis of rap/hip-hop, this is not the book. The book is filled with glaring spelling, factual, and dating errors, is repetitious, and contains little research. It is really a set of personal reflections and reminiscences filled with namedropping and predictable political views. Even the casual follower of the music and culture of the last 20 years will learn little. A satisfactory oral history of the music and industry along the lines of a Please Kill Me or Easy Riders, Raging Bulls has yet to be written."
3,pretty good,Can't remember anything earth shattering that I learned from this book but it was worth the money and time and written by the most respected hip hop journalist ever
4,A lot of memories and some intersting views,"Wow! reading this book and reflecting back on much of the culture brought up from back in the days really had me feelin' this book. Although I didn't agree with all of the authors views in this book, he did bring some insight and depth to some things I really never thought of. As a whole this book was great...everything from graffiti to music buisness to hip hop moguls to politics...for real...read this book."
5,Go Nelson!,"Nelson George, possibly the most underrated music writer of our time, has done it again. ""Hip Hop America"" is a worthy successor to his classic ""Death of Rhythm & Blues"". If you're some [like me] who has never taken rap music seriously before, Nelson will make you sit up and take notice. Like Bill Rhoden in the NY Times, Nelson George may not be someone you always agree with, but he is a writer who commands respect and attention. His recent nomination for the National Book Critics Circle Award for ""Hip Hop"" is all the evidence you need."
1,This is not hip-hop,"In this case, you can judge the book by its cover art: Nelson George's version of hip-hop's elements now includes the mighty dollar. Anyone looking for a deeper understanding of hip-hop (as a progressive artisan culture born from the capitalist wasteland) will be greatly disappointed. George tells of a bizarro world at the intersection of Wall Street and Madison Avenue. It is a pitiful tale of the appropriation of rap music (not to be confused with hip-hop culture) and George's own journalistic misfocus in a consumer society. You will find a similar account of this so-called hip-hop America by watching MTV for an hour or two."
2,Sweet 75 - self-titled (Geffen),"Sweet 75 is the project of former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, which here he plays a twelve-string guitar and has fashion plate freak Yva Las Vegas providing the vocals. Okay, at best. Some fans may actually dig this 14 track CD. It's quite different from the Foo Fighters. Which, I wanted to mention, ONLY get this disc IF you're truly interested in exploring some little known alternative pop. Avoid altogether if you're one of those countless fans that are desperately trying to rekindle that Nirvana nostalgia. Gosh! I used to get SO tired of so many others saying, how much you GOTTA support the Foo Fighters because Dave Grohl 'used' to be in Nirvana. Guess what, boys and girls. I actually got to see Nirvana like six months before Kurt Cobain's death. I mean Foo Fighter is a decent band, but, GEEZ!"
3,good album,"Good album, but the editorial review said something about the best compliment would be to say its not a foo fighters album... of course its not a foo fighters album, this isn't the foo fighters, and they're not as musically talented as the foo fighters either. Its a softer cd than I expected, and I recommend foo fighters much more highly..."
3,Good Vocals...,"This album is pretty easy on the ears. It's got great vocals by Yva Las Vegas, whose vocal stylings are reminiscent of Linda Perry. The catchy rock fueling Yvas vocals is not as crunchy as the Foos, but it is a refreshing change when a former band member has more talent and a different sound than the band that spawned him. Not my favorite album, but definitely one to throw in once in a while for some decent, flavorful rock."
4,A Sandra Brown Fan,"A nice, light read to curl with in the evening. Has a great love story.I especially like the intrigue created by Rana's secret hanging over her.Another book to check out, 'Shadows of the past' by Hilda St James."
3,Fast and simple,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for depth, sometimes, not. This was one of those books that didn't involve much thought. Just a quick and light hearted read that made you feel good. However, I did think that it could have been much better and have read much better (Hello, Darkness and The Crush). But it's not really fair to catagorize this book with her more intense novels. This was a short book about two people falling for each other while staying in the same house.I gave it only 3 stars because I tend to go for the books that have more substance. But this is a great read if you want to read something while you wait for the next S. Brown book."
2,Not necessarily worth it,"Definately not Ms. Brown's best. The book reads like a diluted version of her best work. The characters, Rana and Trent, lack depth, and the ending is very stereotypical and predictive."
2,Yikes! What a lame duck!,"I thought this would be a really cool story! I was excited to read about the super model who made herself plain in order to live normally. But, what a snooze fest! I almost didn't make it through the story. Rana was boring, the male lead was boring. The only character who had any interesting qualities was the old lady who ran the boarding house!"
2,I gave it 2 starts because I was able to finishe it! Ugh!!,"Our heroine (I forgot her name) is running away from her fame and from her over barring mother who made her a famous model. She wants to live a quite life so she disappears and becomes a ""spinster."" Of course, she is beyond BEAUTIFUL (which you read about 20 times). In the hopes of hiding she puts on blue glasses and becomes ""ugly."" Anyway!Our hero (forgot his name also) is a famous football star who has an injured shoulder. He moves in with his aunt (where our heroine rents a room) so that he can stay away from partying and heal his shoulder. Of course, he is instantly attracted to our heroine. To sum up the rest of the book: Day 1, they meet; day 2, they mentally drool over each other; day 3, more mental drooling; day 4, they fall in love!! That's it folks.P.S. This review (other than the names and professions) is the same as Demon Rumm. Ridiculous!"
4,Enjoyable read...,"This book was a bit of a stretch to believe, but I did enjoy reading The Rana Look. It doesn't seem likely that well-known model Rana/Ana R. could become totally unrecognizable by simply avoiding make-up and wearing old clothes if she really was as famous as Brown made her out to be. That aside, this book was an easy read about the studly NFL quarterback who falls in love with the ""hidden"" model. How many of us spent time in high school gazing at the dreamy quarterback across the room while wishing that he would start looking for more in a girl than just the hot looks? Sadly, I know I did. What happens when this quarterback finally finds out the truth about what is on the other side of the frumpy clothes will have to be discovered by reading the book. It's a fast read and one of Brown's books that I will probably visit again in the future. I do recommend that you read this book!"
2,Read Aloud for a Good Laugh,"My mom has been a fan of the romance genre for many years (Delinsky, Michaels, Adler, et al). Her eyesight failing, I went to the library to pick up some large print books for her, and this happened to be one I chose. She was still unable to read, so I offered to read to her. This stuff just can NOT be read aloud, and certainly not by a middle-aged man to his elderly mother. Whenever we got to one of the ""steamy"" parts, I'd get the giggles and be unable to continue. Mom had a pretty good chuckle herself. If this story (and its ilk) defines the sort of ""romance"" that women are looking for in their lives, well...I'm not sure what to say. I have to believe, though, that there must be better stuff available than this."
5,Waterwise filters,The filters came in record time. They are perfect and just what I need for my distiller.
5,Waterwise Post Filter Replacement Bags,The distiller these filters are used with was well worth the purchase. We distill water almost daily for drinking and cooking. We have owned the distiller for over a year and have only replaced the filter one time. It seems this package of filters will be around for a long time. Good purchase.
4,good service,"I got my Order on-time.words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words,I don't like this survey!"
3,one of the less offensive videos,"My daughter now 2 1/2 liked watching these videos from 1-2. I liked them so that she would get the hebrew. The little actress in this one makes some scary looking faces. Now that my daughter is older, she seems to get disturbed by them! Not as bad as the aleph bet one though."
3,Book in poor condition,"The content is fine. I use the book to show patients photos of their condition with new diagnoses. However, the publishing company apparently left some pages out when printing. So, the book came with several inserts. That is annoying! I like Massachusetts Eye and Ear better but wanted to buy something different for various offices and/or home."
3,Repackaging,This is the same as the original Romophone Complete Recordings Vol I. There appears never to have been a Vol. II.
3,Great game but could have used work,"I picked up a psp a month ago and I have cnc for playstation2 and LOVED it but this game let me down. :( I have to say the gameplay is very fun and the 8-player ad-hoc mode is great but I must say they had a little to much fun with videos and didn't put enough work into the: Ai strength and the story mode length. NOW I have play video games for a decent amount of time and am pretty good but I am not a person who beats a video game in a week,,, BUT with this game I did. And I noticed that it was well,,, just too easy and too short. I don't know it might just be me but it was quite short for the price.This game is great all around but if you want to kill alot of time with it you should probaly discard buying it. I loved this game and will continue to play the crash bandicoot games, but I don't know I guess i'm better than I think at video games."
4,Is it just me?,"I totally love racing games and Crash is one of my favs. It started with PS1 with some crash game and I fell in love with it. When I saw it for PSP, I knew I had to have it. I think it was around 20ish/30ish when I got it. I love it, but I guess I'm not too smart in video games since the first time I beat it, I didn't really get all of the stuff...lol. So I went back to collect them to unlock the last few places which annoyed the heck of out me. I know others will have less trouble, but I just enjoy scrapping in the cash from racing too many times =)All this cash and nothing to do with it and it's still going up. A game I'll pick up again and again to have a few quick races, but not much of a fan of the walking around and collecting stuff thing. The races, time laps, and shooting the cars is basically the games I click every time. Anything else is just a bonus or annoyance to me, lol."
1,Classic styling ain't everything,"Classic styling is fine, but if the radio doesn't get acceptable reception, it means squat! AM or FM reception on this was mediocre at best, & forget any shortwave programming. I added a Terk powered antenna, which didn't help. I bought this radio used on Ebay for my Mom, and I just sold it back on Ebay for a $20.00 loss, but at least it won't be wasting space anymore! By the way, $180.00 list price for this POS?? That is a total joke. You can get 10X the radio brand new for 2/3 the price by buying a Sangean or Roberts Radio unit."
1,Very Poor Quility...Did not work :(,Very un happy..sent it back and did not get all of my refund back!
1,An expensive disaster,"Anybody who buys this utter piece of junk either has too much money or should have his head examined. Basically, you'll be acquiring some fake looking cabinet, a cheesy cloth grill, and a tuner whose quality is distinctly less than a $5.00 cheap-o from Dollar General. If you think you're going to enjoy shortwave broadcasts, think again. Both bands come up with barely audible static. Even the FM reception is tinny and static-ky, and drifts off station like the FM radios back in the 1960's.Apparently a lot of people are VERY UNHAPPY with this engineering mess because the company will come up with any excuse to keep from honoring their warranty. Believe me, I can't think of one positive thing to say about this piece of crap"
3,Grudig 940...great for XM,"I bought this radio(the first edition) about 6 years ago, for the looks and as a conversation piece with my Cigar Humidor and 1900s work desk. The tuning was iffy, the lighted dial poor, shortwave? Who Cares? Really didn't get it for that...the piece acted as a great conversatiion piece for several years, until my wife purchased a XM radio set-up for my birthday last year.....the AUX function was perfect, the dim lighting didn't matter(because of the XM)...and the sound is much better than some of the nimrods on this site claim.....all-in-all it's still a great conversation piece, and now thanks to XM, a nice useful radio...especially when playing the Old Time Channel on XM.....perfect!Rate it a 2 for the first five years of ownership, rate it a 4+ now."
2,Worth the 7 dollars I paid at Goodwill,"But, not worth not much more than 7 dollars. Hard to believe Grundig would put their name on something with a tuner that is this AWFUL. They make a solid case, put 3 speakers in it...and the tuner is worse than my clock radio-local radio stations are even fuzzy, non-existent at night. You can bet I will never buy Grundig ANYTHING ever again. People actually pay 150-200 dollars for this radio. Unreal.Lare"
4,A great homage to a classic radio of the fifties,"If you're looking for an exact replica of a fifty-year-old radio, or if you want the latest in shortwave technology, this is not the radio for you. However, if you want to add a cool retro touch to your home or office, and you also want a radio with modern electronics and decent sound, this could fill the bill. Although it is constructed from modern materials, it is well-made and doesn't look cheap, at least to me. I don't use it for shortwave, but it does a great job of pulling in AM and FM stations in my steel-frame office building. It's a great conversation piece that everyone notices. It met my expecations and I'm glad I bought it."
4,"Looks great, sounds great.","I'm pleased with the Grundig 960 my wife and son gave me for Christmas. No, it doesn't have quite the reception ability that my Grundig ""Yachtboy"" does, but it does pull in a good number of shortwave stations, both foreign and domestic. And it really dresses up the room. It also makes a portable CD player sound good when plugged in. My only complaint is that the tuning knob is a bit stiff. Otherwise, this is a ""keeper."""
1,Beware,"This radio is not a replica of the 960. In fact nearly every claim made for it is false. Reception is marginal on local stations, sound is so-so, shortwave tuning is hit-and-miss. The cabinet material does have some wood origin, but one has just to compare this radio with the real 960 pictured on the carton to see how pitiful this one is. I can't believe I fell for it. A great shame on the Grundig name..."
2,Expensive toy,"If you expect to get a German quality of craftsmanship when you buy this radio, don't. This is a Chinese made(is anything in this world still made somewhere else?) bad imitation of the famous radio set. The manual claims that even knob rims are made form the solid brass. Unless they found the way to make brass look as a metallized plastic, I dont believe it. Also, two small intermal lights for the scale illumination are so weak that you can not use this radio even in a complete darkness. My conclusion is - still a conversation piece and nice room decoration if you don't take it too seriously."
1,Please learn from my mistake !,This radio is not only cheap looking but the sound has a tin quality to it.Forget the short wave as I can barely pull in any stations.I need a flash light to see the lighted dial at night.What a fool I was to buy this radio.Please learn from my mistake!
1,Wrong CD!!!,"I ordered this CD and expected ""Robert Kekaula's"" Kanak Attack only to find that it was nothing to do with Robert Kekaula. I emailed them about the mistake and have not heard from them since to make arrangements for an exchange or refund. I've ordered from them before and never had a problem. Hopefully they'll read this and contact me to fix the problem."
3,Not bad. Same as title published 6 years earlier,"Not bad. It's the exact same title as one published 6 years earlier with the same content, only different cover.Funny Comebacks to Rude RemarksInsults aren't bad"
4,"Little campy, little long, but charming","I live a mile or two from Hollywood Forever and enjoy biking or roller blading through every month or so. (Our toddlers loved climbing around the De Mille mausoleum, seen in the film). This film really captures the feeling of being there, how it varies with time of day or special events. The filmmakers have some of the fond bemusement and objectivity of Erroll Morris films like ""Gates of Heaven."" Sometimes it seems a little too long, but many scenes and juxtapositions are really a pleasure to watch."
1,Not compatible with several Cuisinart models!!,"The product description should note that this **DOES NOT FIT blades for DLC-XP, DLC-X, DLC-5 and LPP models**. I would have appreciated this being listed in the product description as I now have to return this item."
1,Too fragile...,"This item reflects badly on Cuisinart. It is very fragile, and the blade do not fit snuggly. The food processor is a great buy...this is not."
3,"Good enough, just give it a tweak","The design is great for safety and orderliness, but I found I had to remove the lock. The lock was difficult to open when my fingers were slightly wet and then the whole unit would slide around (while holding the blade in the other hand). So I just removed the small part at the bottom!"
2,My Review,"When I purchased the Cuisinart DLC-5 7 cup Capacity Food Processor from Amazon they also recommended this Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder, so I got it. I purchased them for a Xmas gift. Unfortunately when my mom and dad opened them Christmas morning all excited about the disc holder. They do not go together. This food processor had the discs attached to a plastic tube that hooks into the bottom of the processor, the disc holder has space for the discs that don't already come attached, that they would come apart and go into the disc holder box. I know this is hard to understand, but all I can say is make sure that if you purchase this disc holder that you get a Cuisinart food processor that has one tube and several discs and not several discs that each have there own tubes riveted and attached together."
1,Locked Itself- Permanently!,"A blade holder is a great idea. I like the idea that it keeps the blades safe. Unfortunately, my disc holder locked itself permanently and I had to take the unit apart to get to my blades and discs. Cuisinart needs to upgrade the quality of the locking mechanism."
4,Disk Holder,"This device does exactly what I hoped for, provides a safe organized place for the disks and blades on my Chisinart. My only complaint is that it's too safe! It doesn't open by simply lifting the lid, there is a slight complication of a lock so that the lid can't be lifted by curious fingers, but in our (older) household it provides the same kind of safety that childproof caps provide: unneeded! Other than that, it's a great item."
2,Doesn't Hold S blades well and opening mechanism problematic,"I was so excited to get this holder because it held the S-blades. Sadly, they don't stay in place, falling out when one tries to open it. The opening mechanism is also problematic because half the time, it doesn't work. I've actually had to take it apart from the bottom to get to my blades."
3,Okay but...,"I like how the different blades all fit in so nicely. The clear cover so you can see what all is in the holder is great. However, the lock broke the first time I used it. Not a huge deal but did find that rather cheap."
4,Basicallly a must!,"With so many warnings about the sharpness of the discs and the chopping blade, the storing of these items loose in a drawer is unwise. The blade-and-disc holder is well designed. I feel it so much of a NEEDED accessory that it should be included in the basic pachage, with a commensurate increase in price."
2,doesn't match up w/general cuisinart quality,"if you need a place to store discs etc, this will do it. however as noted by others the latch is useless and breaks easily. it works only because it has a place for everything and is better than putting sharp and loose items in a box or a drawer. definitely NOT good with children around."
5,Keep those sharpies in a safe place!,"My husband and I were given a Cuisinart Food Processor as a wedding gift and we love it. The only problem was where to safely store the blades and discs since there isn't sufficient room within the body of the processor to do so. This attractive, compact holder solves the problem. The blades and discs fit neatly into their specified compartments and the lid locks into place preventing any accidental contact with the sharp instruments. We were so pleased to find such an item and especially at Amazon, where shipping is free if purchase is over 25 bucks. Thanks Cuisinart, Thanks Amazon!"
2,Lock Broke Quickly,"Better than nothing, but not by a lot.Dough blade does not stay in place.And the lock broke within a week, trapping the blades inside. I had to unscrew the lock assembly on the bottom to free the blades.The mechanism is made from cheap plastic.I did find a warning in the owner's manual not to turn the switch back to lock when the door is open....talk about extremely poor design!Given the inside of the lock mechanism, it will break eventually even if no one accidentally moves the switch.No point in returning it, as the next one will surely break, too. I've left the lock mechanism disconnected and have placed it in as safe a spot as I can."
3,Good product but needs some re-engineering,"The product is good for storing the blades for the Cuisinart but they need to consider what others have noted too. It has an open bottom so if you plan on grabbing it from the bottom (I do - stored on top of the fridge), you can cut your fingers. I used the box top and taped it to the bottom to avoid the problem. If they fixed that and made room for the spatula that comes with the Cusinart, it would have gotten 5 stars."
3,Lock?,"I saw no real reason for the lock to begin with as I doubt children would have access to the disc holder; however, I dropped the lid shut on mine and it securely locked and would not unlock. Eventually, trying to unlock it (following directions) I broke off the tab that turns to engage or (supposedly) to disengage the lock. With a thin bladed knife, I was able to open it. I have no problem now, except that the hole where the tab was is unattractive, and this was a rather expensive accessory."
1,Not Compatible with Cuisinart Food Processor DLC-KBK,This product is not compatible with the Cuisinart Food Processor DLC-5BK blades.Nowhere in the description of the Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder does it state that fact. How very frustrating!I was very excited to get this product because I needed a placeto store my Cuisinart DLC-5BK blades that came with my newly purchased DLC-5BK food processor(...) so this seemed the perfect solution. The slicing and grating blades do not fit into the compartments provided in the holder as they both have long stems that are not removable. Again how very frustrating!
1,Worthless to the Nth!,"Any serious Cuisinart owner/dailer user with their fine array of multiple blades needs a serious storage/accessible medium for those blades. NOT a counter-top ""display"" item! Cuisinart offered and I have two, pricey stands/racks, with no lids or protection yet they calculated the number of discs per rack wrong. Cuisinart should come up with a secure disc-holder to smartly accomodate ALL discs/blades for a given model and which - if it becomes dirty, wouldn't mind a trip through the dishwasher!"
3,Nice Case -- Bad Latch Design,"I got this case to store the new regular metal, dough blade, slicing and grating blades that came with my Cuisinart food processor. It offers a nice, if a bit flimsy, place to store them.Now for the real problem, the latch. Whatever you do don't turn it all the way to the open mark -- if you hear a click once you do it is too late. Not really, you can disassemble the latch by removing the two phillips screws from the bottom. Then, remove the latch assembly and reinstall it carefully to make sure it latches again. Otherwise, you will have a permanently opened blade and disc holder. It is a very temperamental design. One which I dought will hold up over the long haul. I intend to treat it very gingerly and hope it lasts.Meanwhile, at least I have a place to keep my blades and discs. If kept in the drawer I am afraid they would get damaged."
5,Shoulda Bought it a long time ago,This is a super convenient item. I don't lock it so messing with the lock is not an issue. The lock could probably be a little more user friendly. It stores everything just great. It keeps the dust off of my Cuisinart goodies. I have another three-blade disc holder too. That one came with my Cuisinart. This one is a must-have.
2,Child proof lock,"This is a great way to store the cuisinart blades. However, the child proof mechanism is cheap and broke immediately. Now it sits high on a counter."
5,Very good storage unit,"Stores all blades in a very tidy, compact unit. Unit is slightly wider than the food processor is deep, but tucks away nicely in our corner cabinet. Automatically locks when the lid closes, which prevents stuff from spilling out should you accidentally tip the unit over during transit. Logical design, easily used. Well worth the money to keep yourself safe and your expensive blades from being banged around."
4,safety first,I received a food processor for Christmas and was concerned for the safe storage of the sharp discs and blades. This works fine but is a bit challenging to open and close.
3,Hard plastic with bad/lock option,"It does NOT hold enough of the blades and cutters. The lock needs two hands, one to hold the box and one to twist open the hard lock. It could have been made differently to hold all of items sold with your Food Processor. Took too long to arrive was aggravating to say the least."
4,useful for the food processor,"It makes using the processor much more convenient. However, I was a bit surprised by the quality of construction in terms of the hinge that opens the holder. Nonetheless I would recommend it."
4,cuisinart blade holder,"I just bought the DLC2009 9 cup cuisinart and purchased this to hold the blades. It securely contains the attachments. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the ""locking"" mechanism is unnecessarily cumbersome (pull out knob while turning). This cannot seriously be considered child proofing since the bottom is open. All in all it is a big improvement over the open acrylic rack style that I had been using for my old cuisinart's attachments. For purchase price less than $20 it is nifty."
3,Be sure to buy the right holder for your blades,The blades and discs for the 12-cup Elite series processor do not fit in this holder. I am returning it.
3,Superfluous Item,"I received this blade and disc holder as a gift with my new Cuisinart FP-14DC Food Processor. While it seems to be well made, I prefer the one that came with the food processor. Both my husband and I agree that had we known a blade and disc holder came with the food processor, he would not have purchased the stand-alone unit. I believe this will be a garage sale item come spring."
2,The IDEA of a holder for all these accessories and parts is great but the end result needs help.,The open and close broke our first try at opening it per instructions. We simply used a screw driver and removed the entire apparatus. I wish someone would invent a holder that would also hold the different type lids and that was easy to open and close.
3,dumb latch but holds items well,at first I wasn't so disappointed by the latch (I was suspect after reading the reviews). Then after only 3 uses it broke all together. I am still going to use the container - it stores the blades perfectly and it will just stay in the cupboard so not a huge deal to me but still the latch seems cheaply made.
4,Not for Cuisinart Elite blades and discs!,"Most notably, this case will not fit accessories for the Cuisinart Elite 12- or 14-cup food processor. The diameter of the disc blades is too large, and there is not enough room to fit the second chopping blade (for the 4-cup bowl) or the dough blade. Disappointing, as my model's number (FP-12DC) was not among those listed as not working with this case. The ""lock"" on this case did seem hard to pull out and twist, making me wonder if mine was defective, but then I got it to open again with a bit of wrangling. I would keep this if it fit my processor's blades. As it is, I will upgrade to the larger case for Elite 14-cup."
5,True - MUST HAVE!,This item is a must have for anyone who owns several blades for their food processor. Every piece is organized and stores safely for users. I'm very pleased with this item! Every peice has it's own place and clearly marked for easy placement. I love it.Sue
4,"Handy, clean storage","This item is just as expected, a good place to store my food processor accessories. Only wish there was space for more blades without having to purchase seperate blade holder, but this does the job for the standard set when you purchase the processor..... I don't use the little 'locking' mechanism as it seems really chinzy and I'm afraid regular usage would break it before too long, and it's awkward to manuever right... but top sits down just fine without locking as this sits on the counter..... you may want to use lock for safety if you're moving it in and out of cupboard, though."
5,Great product,"As a somewhat OCD organizer, I am really glad I bought this with my food processor. The blades are super sharp and this holder keeps everything safe AND organized. I would give it 5 stars, but the knob is a little annoying (not enough to keep me from recommending it though)."
1,Incomplete product info,This item only fits certain models of cusinart food processors. it should be specific as to which models!!!!!!!
4,good product,I like this product it keeps my blades organized while using a small amountof space. The lock is hard to open. I keep mine in the cabinet so I just don't lock it.
4,BLADE AND DISC HOLDER,"This disc holder is very attractive and sturdy. I have no trouble with the lock. The only problem, which totally amazed me, is that the bottom is completely open. If a child should turn it over, they could reach inside and get badly hurt.I have no kids around so it is fine for me and i love it."
4,Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder,I am excited to have a holder that protects the integrity of my food processer blades and discs. They fit nicely in their individual slots....they have diagrams to show what piece goes where. Button can be tricky to open the case...there is directions to help you remember what to do. Holder fits on cupboard and is attractive. The shapeof theholder is not compact or space saving. It does not let you stack other items on top of it if it was put in a cupboard. Shipping of product was prompt.
3,Big but Small,"I needed someplace to store my extra blades and this was it. Unfortunately, it really doesn't store many of them. So, in that respect it is small. On the otherhand, it has a nice design that enables picking out the right blade easy. But that is where the big comes in. It is a bit bulky and another thing to take up my limited counter space."
5,Great storage for your Blades!,"This is a Valentine's gift for my husband who is a great cook. He got a new Cuisinart for Christmas with extra blades, so this will be perfect to store those blades in and keep them and us safe."
3,Useful but flawed,"I like the idea of this holder and it does an adequate job but it has a few flaws that should be corrected in future models of this unit.The 1st issue is that this should hold ALL your blades and disks in 1 holder which this is incapable of doing due to severely limited disk slots, only 1 additional disk slot over what shipped with my processor and I already have 3 more disks than this unit can accommodate.The 2nd issue is the dough blade falls out almost every time I open the unit, because of issue 3.Issue 3 it takes 2 hands to open the lock unit, locking unit should be redesigned to allow for single hand opening without picking the entire storage unit up. Granted my unit is new and the lock may wear in to allow this over time, tho I doubt it."
4,Sharp blade disc storage,I am glad that I finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp Cuisinart Blades. I have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried. The only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place. I knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children.Hopefully Cuisinart is aware of the design flaw and working to fix it.
2,No Bottom?,"Was surprised to find that this holder is totally open at the bottom. Do not have much space on countertops and wanted to store in the cupboard but when picking it up it's hard not to touch the slicing part of the blades that hang down, and won't keep the dust out. Very disappointed."
3,Nice storage box,"This storage box is nice to have to keep everything together. The bottom is open, so if you grab it from the bottom you could touch the blades that stick out the slots - it should be solid on the bottom.Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder"
3,Disappointed,"The basic style is pretty good, except I have more then three discs. My real disappointment comes with the issue of no rubber or non slip feet. When trying to open the lid, the holder slides all over the place. This is a serious flaw as you are handling very sharp blades and stability is crucial. I would have expected much higher quality from Cuisinart."
5,Handy and utilitarian,A good way to store the attachment discs and blades for my Cuisinart food processor. Easy to move from place to place without fear of cuts or dropping.
4,Cuisinart BDH-2 Blade and Disc Holder,It's nice for a storage box of my 9 cup Cuisinart blades. It is quite awkward to take out of the cupboard as there is no bottom and no place to really grab hold of it. If it is left on the counter it would be okay. I don't use the lock function as I just leave it unlocked.
4,Great place to store sharp blades,"I would have given this disc holder a 5-star rating except that the child-resistant safety button/knob is difficult for arthritic hands to lift and twist at the same time. If I am very careful when closing it, I can avoid having the safety latch catch, but that does not always work. I wish they had an option to purchase it without the child-resistant device, for non-child older households.Other than that, it is a great way to keep sharp blades and discs organized and safe! It is well-made and stores 3 discs, a dough blade, and the chopping blade. Although it is fairly large, it is easy to keep on top of my fridge, as it is very lightweight but sturdy.This would be a great item for a household with children, with its safety device."
4,Good as a organizer on the kitchen counter,I bought this to store the cuisinart 9 cup blades and disc on the counter. It looks good on the counter and everything is tidy and organized. The lock thing is far from ideal. You have to pull and twist the little knob to open the box and having wet hands while cooking doesn't help! I try to leave the lid just sitting on by bringing it down slowly to prevent it from closing automatically. Be careful that the box doesn't have a bottom so maybe this holder is not as good is you need to store it somewhere else and move it around the kitchen. Overall I would recommend it.
3,FOR ADULTS ONLY!,"I like this disc and blade holder - it looks good on the counter top and holds the discs and blades so I don't lose any fingertips rummaging around for them in a kitchen drawer. However, if you have toddlers in your household, it may not be good for you! First, the half-wit locking mechanism is a fragile piece of junk and broke the first time I used it so it's permanently unlocked. Second, the bottom is partially open and portions of the discs are exposed and this is not a good thing for tiny fingers. Other than that it's fine for household with grownups only."
2,Safe and Convenient storage for Cuisinart cutting edges,"The advertising is great. The specifications read that it should hold everything from our new Cuisinart Elite 12 cup machine. It takes up a lot of space to hold some of the blades and discs with difficulty.We did not throw it away, but will if we ever see one that really does deal with the storage problems well."
4,Satisfied with my purchase!,"The Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder is the ideal place to store blades and discs so that they wont get damaged by banging around in a drawer. I was not very happy with the locking mechanism as it could have been designed to be much easier to use, but overall, I am happy with my purchase.Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder"
4,Handy holder!,"I like this holder. I used to keep my processor parts in a smallrectangular, shallow basket. That made for interesting results whengrabbing for attachments. It is no longer a problem to pull out theneeded part. The only drawback is where to put this, which is moreof a personal problem. I just need to make a spot for it in my overcrowded cabinets. Some have expressed a concern about the latch.It takes a little bit of figuring out, which is a good thing, if you havesmall children. If you don't need to worry about that, there is not a need to keep the latch in the locked position. I am so happy to have at least one appliance for which I can easily find the attachments."
1,disc,It does not hold discs that have the stems on them which my discs do. I returned it. It may work just fine for someone who has the discs with no stems.
1,It doesn't fit!,"This is listed as an accessory for the DLC-5 7-cup food processor on special. However, it works with all Cuisinarts *except* the DLC-XP, DLC-X, DLC-5 and LPP. This would have been nice to know in advance!"
1,You Could do Better,"So, now that we have established, in a different review, that this item will not hold the fixed-stem blades that come with the DLC-5, I have a question.WHY DO YOU STILL LIST IT AS AN ACCESSORY FOR THE DLC-5?????Can't you at least note that it doesn't accept the standard discs instead of expecting everyone to ferret out the information from the reviews?"
1,Not a safety device for homes with children,"I am disappointed in several aspects of this item. The first is that the cutting accessories for the DLC-5 Cuisinart do not fit in the box, despite being shown as an accessory for this processor on Amazon. Additionally, it is quite large and bulky, requiring more space than the food processor itself!Most importantly, I specifically purchased this item after reading reviews about how sharp the Cuisinart cutting blades are and how great the Blade and Disc Holder is for keeping the blades away from children. This is *not* a child-proofing device. The entire bottom of the ""box"" is open. While the cutting edges are protected when the holder is locked and sitting on a counter or table top, you can easily cut your fingers by picking up the holder and sticking your hand inside through free access on the bottom side."
2,"Personally, I don't need this...","I like being organized as well as the next person, but based on the other reviews warning that this holder does not fit the blades for all Cuisinart models, you might consider doing what I have done for the last 20 years. I bought a small, rectangular plastic basket for about a dollar, and simply store my discs and blades in that. The discs sit vertically in the basket, and it's easy to pluck out the one I need. Simple and inexpensive solution!"
1,It's a pain!,I found out the hard way that the Cuisinart DLC 5 is NOT compatible with the Blade and Disc Holder - BDH-2! I suppose part of it is because I had no idea that there were ratings for this item ( way way way down the page!). I now see that others have had the same experience from many months ago and it is STILL being listed as an accessory. When I bought my Cuisinart - which I love- it was the only one shown and the Blade holder comes up with that specific style of Cuisinart. Hopefully others ordering will scroll WAY down and see my input!
1,Poor Lock Construction,"The locking mechanism is VERY fragile and appears to be poorly designed. It requires a pull and twist of a very small dial to move the spring-loaded gears (yes, gears) to disengage the lock. It doesn't take long for the gears to slip and the locking mechanism to get stuck in a locked position. Once this happens, you need to disassemble the lock (two phillips screws) and re-engage the gears.If this happens to you, be careful not to grind the gears as you'll render the locking mechanism inoperable.I'd give this 0 stars if I could."
4,Great!,"This is great storage for the blade and accessories. Keeps them clean and right where you need them. The only drawback is the knob that opens it, sort of hard to pull it to get it to turn. A longer knob might be easier."
4,need another disc slot,"It is a great storage unit but seems as though there a 5 discs available for the Cuisinart, there should be additional slots."
5,Wife Likes it so What Else Matters,Great addition for the food processor. There a too many sharp items not to be able so store them safely. And I hop that by storing them properly they will stay sharp longer. Good price too for a item that looks of pretty high quality.
3,Bulky but it gets the job done,"This product will keep your Cuisinart attachments organized, but it's also fairly bulky. It's the only product available that I found, so I was stuck with this, or with the blades free-floating in a drawer. My mom has a great blade organizer that's much more compact, but it seems Cuisinart doesn't make it anymore."
2,Lock Broken,"When I received it the lock was broken. Instead of going through the hassle of returning it, I removed two screws, dis-assembled the lock mechanism and now keep the holder on the top shelf in my cupboard."
3,Should be included with purchase of a Cuisinart,"Throwing your blades and discs in a drawer in a box is a non-starter. Unfortunately, there aren't too many viable options to this device so you need it.This thing is designed to display your discs and blades on your counter top. Just what I need, another gadget to eat up my precious kitchen counter space! Okay, so I stick it in a cabinet, but that is really not optimal either, since the bottom is open requiring two hands to lift in and out. Why can't Cuisinart (or someone else) sell a closed blade box with a handle on top? I don't need a clear display top, just a functional box to keep my blades safely in order. Oh, and this box only holds three discs, so you need yet more holders for those discs.On a positive note, this does what it is supposed to do. The lock might help keep very young children (and very old seniors) out of harm's way."
4,among top coffees worlwi9de,i have no time for reviews. you are in no position to require anything pls do not bother me again
1,NOPE,"I don't like Illy. It is under roasted. If you like Starbucks, Peets your not going to like this. But then if you hate Starbucks you just may like it. I like my beans almost burnt."
1,Will someone please kill this band?,"Every band has a schtick but please, these guys aren't even funny. And they play their instruments too well. This is the type of humor found hilarious by frat boys, employees of record store chains and people who sport ponytails (sometimes all three). You can't accuse them of classism because they'd say they're ""celebrating"" the culture they mock. Yeah, right. Perhaps if we just ignore this band, they'll go away for good."
3,"Great information, but difficult to read","I appreciate the author's efforts to collect these first-hand accounts of Texas History, but found most of them were difficult to read. This book is not for the casual history reader."
4,Great book,This a wonderful book to help expand the vocabulary of young children. The pages are not cluttered with unnecessary background images. The sounds a funny noises are cute too. I recommend this for any child.
1,doesn't work with leappad 2,"as one cannot tell from the description, know that this cartridge WILL NOT work with the leappad 2. this is an older system cartridge."
5,Leapfrog - Vocabulary,I am so pleased with my purchase. It arrived right on time and in perfect condition. I will be able to wrap it for Christmas morning. This booklet covers the vocabulary I want to introduce in a fun and engaging manner. I know my son will love it for Christmas.
5,CP,"I love this cd, there is one song that so great on this one. If your heart is open to God, you will love it also. (I give you my heart)."
4,I'm not a local,"When I put down this book and looked up, I was surprised to see I was not in the Pacific Grove/Monterey area. This book takes you, almost physically, to the Monterey penninsula. The descriptions just make you want to pack a bag and go visit (well, except for murders, attacks, suicide and witchcraft). I particularly enjoyed ""Reunion"" and ""Borscht in the Bay"". In fact, I look forward to finding out what kind of trouble ""Woody"" gets involved in next...and I would sure like one of those burgers from The Grill."
5,The French Farmhouse,I met this book in a collection in a rented house near Cour Cheverny. I have a French Farmhouse about five kilometers from there and am going to do some restoration when I live there. This book is very helpful in showing details of construction in both French and english terms. I also enjoyed identifing the style details in the buildings around the Touraine. The book is very well organized and represents a great amount of work and research. Amazon found me a like new copy at less that new price. A great service.
3,"Static, Silence and Shimmer","With only three albums to their name, The Sundays concentrate on making each of their albums shimmering perfect pop. ""Static and Silence"" was no exception, with vocalist Harriet Wheeler's cheery voice floating above all the charming guitars. That also have decided to allow a few changes in the formula, with more electric guitars (""Another Flavor""), heavier orchestration (""She""), jazzier textures (""Your Eyes"") all while maintaining the sound that characterized their first two albums.What ""Static and Silence"" misses is anything as unforgettable as their initial single ""Here's Where The Story Ends"" from their debut and the gorgeous cover of ""Wild Horses"" from ""Blind."" (So perfect that Susan Boyle did it note for note on her debut almost 20 years later.) ""Summertime"" here comes closest, and ""Folk Song"" also sounds great. For the most part, though, The Sundays make ""Static and Silence"" a dreamily pleasant, if average album."
5,The Sundays are the best!,The lastest album of the Sundays. The music have a different feel from the previous two albums but they are still awesome. I listen to this CD all the time and Harriet Wheeler's voice is the prettiest.
3,"beautiful at times, same-y at others","I very much enjoy listening to Harriet Wheeler, and at times the rest of the band carries the day on this one. It sounds like Gavurin has learned to play slow which is a hugely difficult thing to do.It's good, and very pleasant on the ears. I just hear moments of greatness (""Another Flavour"") that makes me long for what this band could do."
3,Not that stunning at all.,"Well, if you are a great fan of Innocence Mission, if you've ever listened to their ""Glow"", and expect something similar to that, like I did, you'll be a bit disappointed with ""Static and Silence"". I bought it because so many have praised it and compared the band to Innocence Mission, my favourite band. Well, there are some great tracks on this album, but some of them sound very simple and maybe a bit boring, too."
3,You can't judge this book by it's cover or title,"I thought I was gooing to be reading a book about the assassination of JFK. This book is a work of fiction that deals with the attempted assassination of Castro and murder of Marilyn Monroe. Read the book description before you buy, because this is what you will be getting."
2,not great,This was smaller than I had realized. The fabric is an odd fuzzy blue material rather than a soft flannel or cotton. The smell is nice though.
4,Best wrap ever until it caught on fire,"This neck wrap has saved me from suffering through the pain of headaches and cramps for about a year now. However i am giving it 4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 stars because I just put it in the microwave, and it promptly caught on fire even though it was only in for a minute. It was great for the time I had it. Will probably be looking into other brands for my next one though, don't want to burn my house down!"
1,Dumbest,"I'm glad I didn't pay for it, but just borrowed it.The cops are portrayed as more unintelligent than is credible by any wild stretch, even though it is set in New Jersey. It falls well below humor into something unsettling, and seems to be a black author having his revenge on white cops. I could enjoy that if it were funny, but it is just dismal."
1,Talk about paranoia.,"I am very interested in events concerning Area 51 and felt that this would enlighten my curiosity. Instead, the author is a perfect example of an individual that gives UFOlogists a bad name. Despite the extremely poor presentation (home video cam showing a screen with still slides), the extent of the paranoia he represents as 'facts' ( eg. cellular phones are a Government ploy to cause mass histeria) are simply amazing, and the viewer, in the end, is left with absolutely no satisfaction or new information than they probably already suspect. Instead of focusing on 'Area 51' information, you will be guided through the mind of an extremely disturbed, paranoid, uninformed, speculator, who see's every action of the Government as a subversive plot against the gullible American public. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! END"
5,The biggest band of Shasta County,"I grew up in Redding, so I feel a connection to Harvester. Though this is the only album I've heard by them, I conclude that they are masters. My brother bought it from Bog Bean Books and Music (the local used music store) and I loved it from the moment I heard it. ""It's Been a Long Day"" gets stuck in my head a lot. Not that it is a bad thing, considering the song is great. ""Shasta County"" is a nice homage to my home county and does quite well, though it is only an instrumental. Other tracks are great as well from one of the few alterna-country bands I've heard."
1,Information is too old to be useful,"This book was published in 1991. Unfortunately in November 1999, Hurricane Lenny inflicted a massive underwater storm surge on Bonaire that destroyed many of the dive & snorkel sites referenced in this book. Many sites have nothing to look at until 30' depth. I also found this book to be lacking in local color.The best book on Bonaire diving & snorkeling is ""Shore Diving Made Easy"" that you can buy for US$10 at the island dive shops. It is up to date with recommended entry/exit points and suggested landmarks while diving."
2,"Not bad, but there are better guides available","I bought both this book and the Schnabel ""Diving and Snorkeling Guide to Bonaire."" This book was by far the better of the two, with more information (both diving and non-diving), excellent pictures, and just overall a better guide to diving on Bonaire. If you only take one guide, this should be it."
4,Good review of dive sites,"I bought this book before going to Bonaire in the summer of 2002. Our group of 4 used it extensively during our stay there and found it very useful in describing the different dive sites. The book does a very good job of describing how to find the shore diving sites, where to park, how to enter the water and what to expect in the water. There is a good map and good broad overviews of the island, the culture, marine life, hotels and resturants. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone planning to go to Bonaire."
2,Just plain dull,"Academic jargon and boring prose doom this short book from the beginning. The authoir has forgotten she needs to tell a story. Details of land transactions, of which she goes on far too long, read about like a phone book."
5,Amazing historical record,"I have dozens of ballet DVDs, and this one stands out as unique. Sure, the video isn't the best since it's from the early 60s, and I don't think that preservation was important then. It's black and white and looks like it's 50 years old, which it is. Unlike the other reviewer, though, I thought the dancing was amazing. There are dances choreographed just for Firestone that have never been seen anywhere else. The Danish Ballet dancers were simply fearless, and Nureyev looks like a panther. Maria Tallchief is at her finest in a Degas ballet produced just for Firestone. This DVD is a keeper for me and an invaluable part of my collection."
1,Save your money!,"This DVD is of exceedingly poor quality, both visual and sound. The selections, while of note and fame, are unevenly danced and poorly photographed. It is hard to imagine a Nureyev performance being less than wonderful......but.....these are. All in all, i'd have been happier buying a latte and re-watching another DVD."
5,Black Lab's album is a stunning musical achievement.,"This album is by far the best I have ever heard. While some say that only the first five songs rock, I disagree. The whole CD is simply gripping and emotionally heartwrenching, especially track #12, ""Gates of the Country."" Black Lab is the most promising band around, and I look forward to their next album. Their dark, introspective lyrics and music make them unique. If you are a fan of U2 or Live, buy this CD."
4,Rock on!,"A lyrical album that was made famous by the song ""Wash it Away"". This isn't even the best song on the album! Far better tracks include ""Cant keep the Rain"" and the haunting ""Ten Million Years"". Listen to the words to these and you will spend hours playing them over and over. It sounded like a soundtrack to my entire life!"
4,this was such a cool cd,i saw them when they played at shoreline spring last year. i fell in love with the song time ago. it's so incredibly beautiful. the entire cd is great. it's something you could listen to with out changing around.
4,"Unique, fascinating compositions","I was happy to find this CD on amazon.com, after losing my original copy to irreparable scratches. It's definitely a unique collection of songs - I think it's brilliant but it's something I have to be in the mood to hear, and I understand that some people don't have any particular fondness for this CD. ""Ten Million Years"" is an amazing piece."
4,So many people are missing out...,"I first heard 'Keep Myself Awake' by Black Lab on the Buffy album. A song which, alone, makes it worth buying. I immediately started looking for them, and managed to have the album imported, though it doesn't include 'Keep Myself Awake'. I would have given the album 5 stars, had they stuck to the songs they're good at all the way through, such as 'Time Ago' and 'Gates of the Country'. Unfortunately, songs like 'X-Ray' seem a little too metal for them and can spoil the taste of the others. All in all though 'Your Body Above Me' is a fine example of rock music which is being sorely missed by many. Hopefully they wont go so unnoticed for long. I sincerely hope they grace us with a second album soon."
3,an average cd from an average band,"There are some great songs on this album, but unfortunatly they are held down by some of the gloomy not-so-great songs. ""Time Ago"" is an upbeat, awesome song, but I was wrong to think that the rest of the album would be just like that song. In fact the rest of the album is dreary and down, and don't buy it unless you've listened to it, and you're ready to buy the whole album."
3,A couple of great songs,"I saw Black Lab perform as the warm-up act for Our Lady Peace a few years back. They only played a few songs, but I was impressed and decided to buy their CD. I absolutely love two songs on this CD (which is NOT a live CD as the banner here claims). ""Wash It Away"" is an uptempo rocker that epitomizes the late 90's modern rock sound. ""Time Ago,"" on the other hand, is a rather beautiful rock ballad. The rest of the CD is ok, but I really haven't ever been able to really get into it. After awhile it starts to sound repetitive and drones on a bit. Overall, it's worthwhile for the couple of great songs, but may not be the kind of CD you listen to repeatedly."
2,uninspired,Just another forgettable band. The cd is not awful but there is nothing here that will be remembered a couple of years from now. Save your money.
4,Buus Fury Is Alsome,I think the game will be really fun to to play.If you own the last two games you can pretty much guess what this one is like.It should be a good game full of action and adventure.I'm looking fored to its release.
5,VERY COOL GAME!!!!!,"I love this game!! It is so cool!! I love being able to play as Super Saiyan 3!! Also, making Buu's death a minigame is cool! I love how you can get armor and stuff! THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!"
3,"really true to the anime, you wont be dissapointed :)","this game stays true to the anime and really gets into the story and stays very fun overall, its a real good gift for any DB fan."
2,Boring,"This is a boring and ridiculous cube. For a 2x2, it only has 2 colors! There is a green side, and then all the others are pink. One side of the pink has a monkey face, and you're supposed to either solve for green, or solve for green and pink (no regard for the face), or solve for everything. But the idea just doesn't work. If you want to get a 2x2, definitely go for the rubik's ice cube. It's just like a regular rubik's cube, although the colors set-up is a little off (blue is beneath white, etc), but the ice cube is still way better than this. I just got this in the mail today, and I already sent it back for a refund. Don't get this."
3,"Yes, for Little Ones","My daughter loves this cube (2x2x2) when she want to show how smart she was (mess it up and return by reversing it).When she is a year or two older, I will show her how to solve it."
1,What is the point?,"Purchased this for my 6 year old, only to discover that half of the sides are identically marked. This makes actually soving the cube akin to doing it in the dark. It does not make it easier, it makes it significantly harder. Eventually we added stickers to each side to distinguish them. Once done, my son needed less than an hour to figure it out on his own. Now the baby chews on it without protest.It is very durable I can say."
4,A Review by Little Foot,"This book is about a lamb and a lion. There are three chapters and each chapter is a different story. The first story is about when Lamb starts her own club. The second story is about when Lion, Lamb and Lamb's baby sister go on a picnic. The third story is about when Lion is moving away. I liked this book a lot because I wasn't expecting what happens at the end of each chapter. I am in second grade and for me it was fun to read."
4,more please,"This video is based on the books by Richard P. Hobson, and is a nostalgic trip back to real frontiers and cowboys. The story is pre World War II in British Columbia, with two cowboys from the States with a dream of their own cattle ranch. Yep, there are cows and cowboys in British Columbia, with the expected moose, bear, beaver and wolves already occupying the ranch in the sky. Of course, Rich is not the usual cowboy but a socialite drop-out and maverick from the East coast, so when he manages to elope with a socialite in Vancouver, it isn't too far fetched. The story is just beginning with ranch hands enlisting in the Canadian army, forcing Rich to recruit underage boys, with one surprise, to work his infant dream. Good fun, but where's the rest of the stories? The Canadians had produced at least two seasons of Hobson's stories, so this is a revamp introduction of a very successful series. I'd like Amazon to make those Canadian seasons available, since Amazon purchased them."
2,Strength,Not a movie that just keeps your attention but a nice movie to show what can be done if you put all you have into surviving trials
4,Nothing Too Good For A Cowboy DVD,This was a great romance and comedy movie worth watching. I enjoy these older days movies and this one was a good one which I will watch again and again thanks! I also received this movie in a timely manner too!
3,Ok for beginners...it's the Hyundai of digital cameras.,"This was my first ever digital camera and once I had it out a couple of hours and found myself looking for more batteries! Operation is very simple and easy to use. However, it comes with the smallest available memory card and I suggest buying a 128mb card...Well worth the money for extended (more than 12) hi-res pictures. At this point, my LED stopped working. The cost is almost as much as the camera, so, I'm buying a new Fugi 5.0 mega pixel. The image quality difference is mind-blowing. Spend the extra money and buy at least a 2.0 mega pixel camera with the extra toys that don't come with the cheaper cameras. If the camera doesn't come with the AC-adapter for home or the additional battery pack keep looking for one that does. The alternative is pulling a wagon behind you full of batteries."
1,This could be a good book,"This could be a good book, but it isn't. This book is awful and smacks of a childish preteen preoccupation with pictures of naked females. The 'pictures' are very crude and poorly done drawings of mostly naked women that have little or nothing to do with the small amount of text included. This book actually does a disservice to learning or understanding Chinese characters and so is a waste of time and money.Hopefully someday someone will actually do a book that uses historical information to explain the source of the Chinese characters and how they developed. It would be an excellent source for learning and understanding the Chinese language. This book, however is NOT it. Save your money for something worthwhile."
3,"A nobel attempt, the author meant well.",I bought the book because I was fascinated with possibly learning chinese writing. As I got through the book I realized the simplicity of the writing is from ancient styles. The writing today is much different and one no longer can see the picture within the picture. It might be a great way to introduce chinese writing to children.
1,"I would rate this lower, I was given a choice between 1-5","The radio is okay for AM & FM Reception. It has good FM Stereo Sound. However, The main reason why I bought the Grundig Yacht Boy 300 PE Was for the Short Wave Band. The reception is terrible and often non existing. If you want this radio for travel, be sure to bring an external antenna with you. Otherwise look for a better quality short wave."
1,"Good FM clock radio, very bad SW receiver","DO NOT BUY. My father bought a new YB400 for me for a graduation present in 1995. I have never been able to pick up any SW station. I am in Colorado now, 100km away from the high power time stations, and I can't pick them up. Just hear buzzing noises. Nothing on LW either. AM (MW) reception is poor but it does get some stations. This was really expensive to turn out to be an FM clock radio. The FM reception is good, the clock works fine, the light is nice. Equivelent to a nice $20 radio for 8 times the price."
2,Grundig 400 PE Receiver,This would be an ok item to take along on a trip but not something one would care to use on a regular basis. Tonal quality is less than I had expected.
1,Beware,"It's nice looking, end of story. I do not usually respond to reviews, but I felt compelled to do so. If you are looking for SW to the UK this totaly sucks. A total waste of money. I bought this direct from Amazon and will never trust them again in any form of electronics. They are good in books and the like, but not sw radios"
5,Fantastic quality and reception for a portable!,"This was my first shortwave radio and it continues to perform wonderfully. Easy to connect an external antenna for even greater reception. You'll love all the little extras such as numeric keypad, SSB, 40 channel memory, and that convenient little light for bedside listening. I've taken this radio all over the place and it never lets me down. Highly recommended!"
4,Excellent beginner's SW,"I've had a Grundig YB400PE radio for several years, and it has become my bedside alarm/radio. The SW performance is pretty good out of the box, and the unit ships with a retractable longwire that can help improve reception. It does receive SSB transmissions, but does not have a selector to specify LSB vs. USB...you have to compensate with the fine-tune knob. This is probably the greatest weakness of the radio, along with the almost useless (in SW) scan function. An adjustable squelch or carrier detect would be nice......I have successfully received RTTY and WEFAX transmissions using this radio and my Mac, so if you are interested in utility monitoring this is a cheap way to get started. You'll need a computer and software, of course......."
5,Awesome radio,I've had my radio for about six months now and I could not be happier. It pulls in stations from all over the globe 24 hours a day. It is easy to use and extremely reliable. I recently took it to Mexico with me so I could keep up on U.S. news and it provided me with several U.S. broadcasts. I love this radio.
1,CRUEL,"IF YOU BUY THIS THEN YOU NEED 2 DIE!THIS PIECE OF CRAP IS CRUEL TO ANIMALSFISH DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO SWIM AROUND IN A FLIPPIN PICTURE FRAMEITS NOT HUMANEIF YOU ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO HAVING FISH THAN BUY A ""REAL"" FISH TANK NOT A PICTURE FRAMEFISH SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR THE ENJOYMENT AND ENTERTAINMENT OF PEOPLEFISH NEED A NICE DECENT LARGE LIVING SPACENOT A PICTURE FRAME"
1,stupid stupid stupid,"ok this is the stupidest thing i read all the reviews and all the nagitvive ones i agree with i wouldnt put a guggy just one guppy in the i have african cichlids mbunas to be exact and i have a 29gallon i over stocked mine but i dont carei have 15 if you count the two plecos ok i have a 60 gallon filter .does this thing have a filter???and if its only 6.34 gallons or 2.16 gallons idk its not worght it.if you want a small fish tank get a desktop or if you want a wall fish tank GET A CUSTOM THEY ONLY COST 1,000 DOLLARS spend it its worth it byebye and thanks"
4,Question for other customers?,"I m writing from Portugal. I'm sorry my english. I just want to ask 2 things:""Frame a Fish Aquarium - Fish Tank"" brings filters and ilumination?Is it possible to have 1 male beta and 3 female betas and maybe 1 or 2 kuhlis is this type of Tank?ThanksMario"
2,Kinda Ugly,The product could be designed a little better in looks. Ugly. As far as fish go. Who cares about the fish! They have no feelings. Love them if you will. Fish are suppose to be in the ocean or lake. Who cares! Most aquarium fish we not removed from their natural habitat... so what if the feel narrowed. Dumb fish dont know the difference. They live and die the same.
1,Advice from a hobbyist and tank/pond serviceman...,"I've kept fish most of my life and spent a goodly portion researching fish as a pastime (primarily working with salt water aquaria). I've worked with seahorses, sharks, rays, octopods, tropical fish, corals, and ponds. I cannot, for any reason, see why this would be a good idea for a fish tank. By a rough estimate, this tank holds approximately 2.19 gallons of water. That's enough to put TWO one inch fish per tank. I am NOT a PETA supporter, but this system is an equivalent to having someone live in small hallway all their lives. This is not a sufficient tank for any kind of **active aquatic life** that would require a heater. This MIGHT be a nice alternative for betas, african frogs. If you want fish as a conversation piece, I suggest getting an actual tank. Your fish will thank you for not having to look at your mother in law or child's photo all day long."
1,rb,Just plain wrong--OK maybe-just maybe for a Betta - Thats it..Otherwise-just cruel. 3 inches deep?? Looks great for about a week---then--will be nothing but problems and death...Get a real tank. You will be able to express your creativity much better as well as extend the life of the livestock.
3,Experienced aquarist's opinion,"Interesting looking product, but I would only put one betta in here and perhaps one or two dwarf Otocinclus to clean up any algae that may develop. Some tall genuine or artifical plants should complete the package."
1,Shrimp Tank,"Im gonna be frank and honest, this tank is way too small for an average fish. The only thing I see it being good for is if you want to keep a bunch of ghost shrimp in it or maybe a betta fish. Otherwise this tank is complete junk."
1,Cruel,"I don't own this personally, but my hair salon has a very large frame tank on the wall that is teeming with fish. At first I loved it because I thought that it was ""fake."" I thought that it was a tv or some sort of digital picture frame. Then I was shocked when I realized the fish were real. I agree with the previous reviewers....a fish tank is a habitat and should be treated as such, with routine maintainance being a priority to maintain a healthy fish population. This is thinner than my plasma tv. How anyone could think that even one fish would be happy in such an enviroment, never mind several, is beyond me. Although I liked the look of it, in the end this is a horrible product."
1,fish are living creatures,"I am not from PETA, I dont even like PETA but this is wrong. Goldfish get big enought that they could actually get stuck in this tank. Stuck as in unable to move at all. The only fish that could theoretically be kept humanely in this tank are the tiniest tetras. I haven't done the math as far as how much water this tank holds, but six schooling fish that stay smaller than .5"" could possibly be happy here. Keeping bettas in this tank is cruel. An actual fish tank is the cheaper, more humane, more human choice."
1,Ripped Off,"As of March 2008, the phones to the ACI Corp. are no longer in service. I placed my order in Feb., they took my money and now there is no way to contact them for a refund.DO NOT ORDER FROM ACI CORP. - THIS COMPANY IS A RIP-OFF."
2,Strange Sizzla habit of putting the same exact track on more than one CD under different song titles.,"Sizzla has this strange habit of putting the same song on multiple CDs under different song titles. I know because I own his complete discography. For example, on ""Jah Knows Best"" the song ""I Myself Know"" also appears on the CD ""Burning Fire"" under the title ""No Man Stand Alone"". Do you know any other artist who engages in this practice? I don't."
3,Not the best intro to sizzla.Still...,"Not the best introduction to the man,but a fair to middle album by the ever prolific Sizzla.Seriously he churns out around 3 albums a year (on various labels) and ever since 'Words of Tryth' he's trod a rougher lyrical line and delivery.There are some quality roots rhythms present throughout and the version of 'Subterranean' is a highlight,however the more experimental musical aspects of the album (whilst interesting) don't do it for me and Sizzlas' gruff vocal can get a bit much after a while.One for collectors.If you're really keen to hear something fresh from Sizzla, full of inspired Roots,Reggae,Rightiousness and creative use of his vocal range... I'd recommend 'Speak of Jah'"
2,"A decent game, although limiting.","I have always been a fan of monster based card-games, but Dual Masters 2 Kaijudo Showdown is a, ... well, a mediocre game.One feature that I like, is that you can customize your player-avatar. (To some extent) However, the game is quite limiting, with only three-hundred cards to be collected, and very limiting re-play value.The one thing that would make this a great game, is if you have someone to play it with. but, single-player story mode is just mediocre.If you are a Dual Masters fan, then you might want to pick this one up, otherwise, unless you are like me, and love card games, you may want to avoid this game."
4,Excellent Stuff!,"Clif Shots really do work. It gives you a boost in energy, staves off the lethargy of the 3rd lap, and restores the bodies' balance of sodium, preventing cramps. And all this while being organic to boot! I think I really like that part best. Too much synthetic gels and food makes it difficult for the body to handle. Sure synthetic gels may work a little better, but it doesn't seem to make sense when you're trying to enjoy nature and get fit and healthy. I think the conscious effort to protect nature with the litter leash is very commendable. It's not too difficult to punch a little hole to prevent fully tearing across and letting loose upon the world a non-biodegradable bit of aluminum plastic tab, so i don't see why other companies can't do that too. Do your bit... go organic, and protect nature too... :)"
4,Great price,"My husband loves these things on his long bike rides. Amazon's price was significantly lower than any local stores , plus the stores were always out of stock."
2,price is right...taste is not,"You couldn't beat the price for these gels, but the taste is just awful. I've been running for years, so I'm used to taking gels on the run without water - can't do it with these."
2,Terrible taste,"Hammer gel is a ton better. I love Clif Bars and thought this would be good but it tastes like you are eating molasses and that is what it tastes like. Might be good on a bisquit but when you are sucking them down mountain biking not a good combo. They were super cheap and now I know why. Maybe a different flavor would be better than the Mango. Go with Hammer gel, I really get an extra energy kick with them and the flavors are good."
5,Fast energy...,"This is a great product. For endurance sports, this shocks my energy levels and prevents cramping.The taste is tangy and kind of extreme, just what I need in times of pain."
4,"Tastes okay, gets the job done","I have used the Mocha (caffeinated) and Vanilla (non-caffeinated) flavors.They taste...acceptable. The mocha has the expected bitter note of caffeine. Both flavors have a distinct ""rice syrup"" taste - if you've ever eaten puffed rice cereal, you will recognize it here. In the case of the vanilla gel, it is quite pronounced and borders on unpleasant. There are definitely better-tasting gels than this. Sorry Clif.Packaging is thoughtful. The ""litter leash"" works as intended about 90% of the time. I've never accidentally sprayed gel everywhere trying to open one of these, which is not true of other brands. (Perhaps I'm unusually ham-fisted?) Even the box that the 24-pack comes in is convenient - my shelf of cycling food is organized using Clif gel boxes.Excellence in packaging balances the underwhelming taste."
5,Tastes like cookie dough,"This stuff tastes like chocolaty cookie dough. I really like it. 24 of these is a lot of little packets, so they're good value. And, they're little. I'd never get even close to full on one of these, but they're a great snack when I just want something small. Probably the equivalent of a spoonful of cookie dough.Most chocolate flavored nutritional stuff doesn't even taste like chocolate, so I was surprised this actually tastes like chocolate.The ""Litter Leash"" feature is really cool, because this prevents you from getting rid of the top. It keeps the tiny part you usually discard, attached to the rest of it. I didn't realize that's what the ""Litter Leash"" did until I looked carefully at the packet, so the first one of these I ate, I practically destroyed the whole thing. I thought it was super cool after, though."
4,Good Product,"I have been using the Mango flavor Clif Shot Gel on my long runs. I think it works great and tastes pretty good. However, I also like to try out other brands from time to time. What I have found is that the Clif Bar Gels are thicker than other brands (specifically Powerbar Gel and GU Gel). Also, the package was harder to open than the Powerbar Gel. While I didn't find these two factors to be huge disadvantages for the Clif Bar Gels, I think they are something to consider. If you are unfamiliar with the carbohydrate gel market I would advise trying a few brands first before committing to buying a 24-pack of any one brand. You can find individual gels in places like Sports Authority or specialty running or endurance sports stores. Pick up one of each brand the store carries and then you'll be able to judge which brand you like best.In short, I give the Clif Bar Gel 4 out of 5 stars because of the extra thickness of the gel and difficult-to-open package."
3,Easy on the stomach but sticky,"I use the RAzz a lot. I like the flavor and it seems easier on the stomach than other gels and I've used them all. Especially Hammer.It's really sticky though and when on the bike, the packing is hard to tear open with your teeth. It's difficult to get all of the product out of the package. So on the basis of packaging and the fact that I am primarily a cyclist, I give it a 3."
4,"Mango Tastes OK, but it has no caffeine","The Mango flavor tastes OK. I prefer the vanilla, but these really aren't for taste (it's for nutrition) so it's fine. The ad is misleading because it says ""with caffeine"" but this flavor does not have any. Only the mocha, double expresso, and strawberry have caffeine. I prefer just a littel bit of caffeine like the strawberry, but it does not taste as good as the mango. Buying the subscription is a good deal, but I am not sure I will be able to finish it in 6 months. It would be nice if there was a variety pack so you don't get tired of the same flavor. I ordered it April 21, and the expiration date says Sept on the packets, so that really only gives me 5 months. If you use these more often than me, than I think you will be happy with the product."
2,literally made me sick......,I've only tried the Strawberry flavor and it literally made me sick. It tastes SO awful to me - very salty. I immediately felt nauseous after consuming this - was too busy feeling sick to tell if it gave me energy. I understand it works great for some people though. Definitely try it out before a big race or training session to see how it works for you.
1,It was a good product... not now!,This product (Clif Shot Gel Double Espresso) was made with rice syrup. Now it contains Maltodextrin. The taste and texture are different and IMHO not good.I will not be buying this product in the future.
1,cliff is disgusting,I was given one of these during a half-marathon race. I took a bite and spit it out because it was so disgusting. I was tempted to run back and throw it at the person handing them out.
4,energy gels,Great tasting energy gels. Really like the flavor and the burst of energy that you get after eating the gel. Recommend it and will try other flavors.
4,Works fine at an excellent price,"For what it is and how much it costs, these gel packs works fine. It's a little more viscous compared to other brands (e.g. PowerGel or Gu), so be sure to definitely drink water with them."
3,"They work, they're yummy, but....","I really want to make these my racing gel of choice, but they are the WORST when it comes to their ""litter leash"" and getting the damn thing open during your event! All to often I've pulled the tab and it comes off without tearing off enough to release the gel. Imagine trying to tear through the package while racing with your teeth. That's usually what it comes down to.If they fix that issue, I'm sold on the product itself. Great energy, tasty, etc."
1,Chewing Tobacco,"The taste of the Clif Shot Energy Gel Mocha is that of chewing tobacco. The first thing I thought when I squeezed this into my mouth was ""Levi Garrett"" or ""Redman Golden Blend."" It was all I could do to keep from vomiting because it tasted like I was swallowing a mouthful of chew spit."
3,Taste takes some getting used to,"I haven't tried very many flavors of the cliff shot energy gel yet, but the razz certainly takes some getting used to. It is quite tart and (of course) sweet. Personally, I'd much rather eat a piece of fruit, but nothing beats a gel in terms of ease of use and portability."
4,"Goes down easily, but I still wonder about how to determine effectiveness of any gel...","This Clif Bar gel (I've tried both the Razz and the Chocolate flavors) are, like most gels, easy to carry, open, and eat. The product info states that Clif Bar gels are ""fast-acting and easy-to-digest, semi-liquid sources of carbohydrates (70% complex/30% simple) and electrolytes.""Okay, what I am looking for is a mix of sugars to fuel my muscles during a race (I'm using one every 6 miles), and the right combination of electrolytes for mid and long-distance running. Is this it? Well, I haven't passed out yet.I do appreciate the use of organic ingredients, and, as I remember, it does not contain HFCS."
5,Great taste and gives me energy burst,"Now that I am fitter, I am going on longer bike rides, 2-3 hours of riding (40+ miles). My coworkers who do a lot of cycling convinced me that I should put some electrolytes in my water and have some energy gel about once an hour. I picked up some samples at the local store. The Hammer gel was awful; it left a horrible after taste and my fingers were pretty sticky. The Clif gel, though, was really tasty (I have tried the citrus and mocha so far and like them both). The gel was pretty tasty, not too sugary sweet. I was able to easily open and eat the gel without making a mess. I was experiencing some cramps in my calves early in the ride, but they felt better after having gel. I think the Clif energy gel really gives me a quick picker upper. I definitely feel better later in the day if I have food and electrolytes during my bike rides; no twitching of the legs. The Clif gel is a winner!"
5,Quick burst of energy and tastes great,I was eating Clif Bars for a while when I started long distance biking. I needed a quick and easy boost in liquid form so I could continue biking while increasing my calorie intake. These are perfect and taste great. It is a little weird getting used to the consistency but overall I highly recommend.
5,Loved 'em,I personally think they're great. I don't think the taste is artificial or nasty. It's a nice switch from the mocha gels I've been running on for years.
3,Beyond Roissy,"Beyond the house at Roissy, what happened to O?Here she's portrayed as an impossibly rich and influential woman. A woman of revenge? Punishment?Descriptive writing, but a bit of a letdown in the story department."
5,its getting better all the time!,This book transformed my sewing. I learned to sew as a child and steered away from clothes with too many details for fear of ruining the garment with bad technique. After reading this book my sewing was dramatically improved.
4,Great overview of recent Czech pop music,"Ahoj! Jak se mate! Definitely a broad range of recent Czech pop music groups and styles. There is everything from energetic party tunes to moody pieces of ethereal beauty. Understanding Czech is not necessary to enjoy this compilation, as the music is entertaining in an obvious and clear way. If you are looking for something a little off the mainstream, then this just could be for you! Enjoy!"
4,Ken's legs broke!,"My 6 year old daughter was delighted with the Nutcracker Barbie and Ken combo. Unfortunately, one week after Christmas, she was trying to get Ken to sit down by bending his legs straight out at the hip, and his legs both broke in the joint. She was not using undue force. They are not fixable (Barbie dolls never are.) She was in tears. So we have the costume and the stuff, but no Ken. Looks like I'll be out to buy another one.....Of course the regular Kens aren't jointed like this one, and don't look as good........"
2,works,"mounted, plugged in, it worked the first moment the motor turned.not dissapointed in this product so far..seems to be ok"
4,The Last Sorcerer,"The Last Sorcerer begins with the theories of past philosophers and thinkers like Aristotle and Galileo. It also gives experts about Newton's life through out the entire novel. I found the book a little hard to follow and understand as it jumped from one chapter to the next without much connections between each. However, it is a good source of information on Newton's family, life, and how he grew up to be the great physist he became. Although hard to understand, it is easy reading because the novel is written in a story-book format. It is more engaging and interesting, while still presenting factual information than most biographies."
3,A Good Start,"If previously you have not read a biography of Isaac Newton or lack rigorous training in Physics, then this is a good place to start. The book covers his life, his passions & sufferings, his triumphs and failures, his foibles and his idiosyncrasies. This is not a hagiographic book.One strength of the book is that it discusses Newton's other interests such as Alchemy and Biblical Prophecy. The book is written for a popular audience and thus does not cover Newton's intellectual endevours and interests in depth. Those interested in Alchemy and Mechanics will not find a deep & learned discussion of either Alchemy or the development of science of Mechanics here."
3,The best biography of Newton I've read to date,"I've read other biographies of Sir Isaac Newton, and this is the best. As the title suggests, there is an emphasis on his interest in Alchemy.I worried (unnecessarily as it turned out) that other aspects of his life would be neglected. But his time at the Royal Mint, and his clashes with Huygens, Hooke, Leibniz etc are well covered.The only disappointment for some readers might be that this is not an overtly scientific/mathematical biography - there are no formulae : so if you want to know that little more detail about Newton's discoveries, such as the Laws of Motion, Laws of Gravity, and Differential Calculus, you won't see any of that in here. In fact the word 'Gravity' (perhaps his most famous discovery) doesn't even appear in the Index (although the 'Apple' does)."
4,"Bold, But it Pay's Off","Most biographies of Newton will have you hating his rivals. This one will place them in their proper perspective. They were intelligent rivals whose antagonism spurred Newton to PROVE his greatness as much as drive him into being a recluse. The phrase ""an enemy is an extension of your own shadow"" was never more true of Isaac Newton. Although, he is so forgivable considering his charity of gifts.The bit about the homosexual relation is small, considered a hypothesis, and backed up with facts, even if they are not solid.But it's a solid read, with good perspective.I'd prefer Gleick's book, which does the same (no homosexuality though) with style AND some insight into the thoughts leading up to The Calculus and Principia and Optics. Because this books lacks that, I dropped a star.Worth reading anyhow for the perspective."
5,Love it!,I ordered this for my baby girl. She is 1 1/2 and LOVES Veggie Tales!! The singing ones that is! The CD came quickly and was in good condition. I would buy from this seller again!!Thank you!Tena
2,no internal metal sleeve,I didn't' use these parts because there is no internal metal sleeve and I only like to use aire nuts that have that sleeve to ensure a great electrical connection between the multiple wires.
3,All porcelain,"Like Keith Kirkwood said, these wire nuts have no internal metal sleeve. Which means there is nothing to help connectivity and also (especially for 18 AWG wire) there is nothing to help keep the wires in the wire nut. I ordered these little babies to make the connection for my ignitior in my pellet stove (high temp conditions). Product says it's good for 18-14 wire, but in my opinion... without a metal sleeve these things are not suited for 18 AWG wire. I had to double and triple bend the wire to get it to be thick so that the wire would stay in the wire nut while I pushed it back in place. I still feel a little uneasy about the connection and will always treat it gingerly so the wires don't slip out of the nut. Not the kind of feeling I like to have when I call an electrical project complete.Anyhow, with that said, they do accomplish the task, so I rate them as just OK. I suspect they are all porcelain without a wired sleeve by design so that the nuts can withstand 1800 degrees F!"
4,I like it,great watch just like the one my eldery father had so it was easy for him to use. he likes it alot.
1,I am really disappointed with the software,"I have purchased this software based on the Review ""Home Design Software Reviews 2007"" and this software is rated as second. I have been using ""3D Home Architect Home Design 6"" before which I find it by far much better then this. For me buying this software was really a waste of time and money:- 3D rendering takes a lot of my machine resource and time; untill you get fustrated;- 2 door styles only are provided;- 2 types of 3D rendering only are provided. No option to add additional camera;- you cannot edit any object in 3D view.- objects have no or limited properties to play with...After wasting this money I am now only looking to upgrade my old software with landscaping which I have been unable to get any upgrate..."
1,HORRIBLE!,This program is horrible! Don't waste your money ... it would take to long to detail all the problems with it. This is one software that I wish was returnable ... The box and description are worth much more than the contents.
1,"Agree with the rest, product stinks",I have to agree with the other reviewers. I almost feel like my $40 was stolen from me. After really liking using previous versions this felt like some kind of trick. I expect version 10 to be an empty box.
1,A Major Let-Down,"I bought this because of its compatibility with Mac OS - but I might as well have stuck with pen and paper. The software is poorly designed, not intuitive, has the worst selection of stock objects I've ever seen, and manages to take the fun out of home exterior/interior design! I wish I could get my money back."
2,Previous version files cannot be opened,"If you have created files with previous versions of 3D Home Architect, you might be interested in knowing what I finally located on a support forum (http://forums.encoreusa.com/tm.asp?m=29701):What type of files does this product open? - 1/26/2008 11:09:07 PMThere have been several different 3DHA developers. And, unfortunately, each developer created file formats that were not compatible with the products created by the other developers.So, this is pretty much how the file format for 3DHA breaks down:3DHA versions 5-8 cannot open any 3DHA file created with version 4 or earlier.3DHA version 9 cannot open any 3DHA file created with any previous version of 3DHA."
1,3D Home Architect Home & Landscape Deluxe Suite Version 9,Where's the manual???? A manual is not included with this software. The help files are not helpful either. I don't even know where to begin. I'm very disappointed.
1,Wish I hadn't....,"purchased this. Wish I had read these reviews before purchasing it (I got it at a local office supply store). I have a really old (approx 1998) version of 3D Home Architect - it lacks a lot, but is easy to use. I was hoping for some improvements on this one. I've tried many others, including Punch! and haven't liked any of them. That should've been my first clue - it's now Punch! I purchased several programs on that trip and installed them & I can't even get this thing to install! I hope I can get a refund for defective materials, but I'm not holding my breath. Hope there's something better out there - any recommendations? Waste of $40.00......ugh!"
3,Tough book for the first read on Saratoga.,"Overall I like this series of books.Im new to reading on the American revolution, and for me it was more of an overview and I was looking for details.I like the look of the maps, but unfortunately many of the maps are hard to read (black lines pointing to dark green and black spots on a map) and the maps cover both pages so the part in the crease is impossible to see, so that was disappointing.Had a few nice full color pictures (again the crease ruins a number of them) and many of the soldiers in uniform are black and white.I guess I was looking for something different."
4,Saratoga 1777- very good overview,"As a collector of toy soldiers I found Morrissey's book well written and very well illustrated. It is a very good overview of the Saratoga campaign which leaves the reader wanting more. In the back of the book there is a section entitled ""Wargaming the Saratoga Campaign."" I think that it would be helpful for military modellers and war gamers if in the future there would be more detailed information on the manner in which field fortifications were constructed."
2,A Twisted View of Reality,"There is no myth in Cooperative Mondragon if you have lived in Mondragon in 1960's, if you grow thru an artificially induced process of 40% unemployement, and sharing day to strugle of been lucky to get minimum wage and abuses of dictatorship under industrialism of General Franco.The priests who funded the Cooperative (today with 60,000 employee owners) althought no perfect found a better solution.Mondragon is perfect in front of the Enrons, MCIs, not a single person in the cooperative is yet to lose a pension or health coverage, or security of live, that beats 99% what Kasmir tries to compare Mondragon against other forms of ownership."
4,Thought provoking and interesting,"I bought this book having only recently become more interested in worker co-ops as one route to advancing towards socialism - without any illusion that it was possible to get there by this route alone or create little 'islands' of socialism. What I found in this book was a quite subtle and nuanced look at the most famous workers cooperative, which perhaps erred on the critical side but never failed to educate. It raised lots of issues I hadn't considered and didn't come out with any trite answers. For anyone interested in co-ops, workers control or left wing politics this is definitely an interesting read and provides ample food for thought and further debate."
1,Where the heck is a boxed set of season 1?,"This is a disgrace to a great show. There are so many ""bad"" shows out there that have boxed set. This show, it's actors and it's fans, deserves much better treatment than this. Please do not support this stupid decision by Fox, by buying these ""outrageous episodes"". It's a darn fine show, arguably one of the best ever, but a ""bad"" DVD set."
2,"Funny show, bad DVD","Who doesn't know the Bundy family? Al, Peg, Bud and Kelly, and their faithful dog Buck, often accompanied by their neighbours Marcy and Steve (who later is followed up by Jefferson) have been around for ages, and stole the hearts of countless people, including me.However, DVD's like these are hardly worth the effort of releasing in my opinion. While they picked 5 funny episodes, they hardly are the funniest episodes ever.I cannot help but feel as if this collection was meant as a pilot project; just to see whether people would actually buy Married with Children on DVD, rather than releasing the one of the seasons, and then finding out there would be no public interest.Luckily, they realised their error by now, and released Season 1 and 2. I'd definitely recommend those over these 5 episodes."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,"If they were going to release a 'best of' DVD collection of Married With Children, they could have selected some better episodes. I can't believe they settled on these 5 mediocre episodes when I can think of much better classics that could have been included. I'm waiting till they release the full season box sets..."
3,Season 1 Coming soon?,"Well, what I think they are trying to do is copy the way South Park came out with there Volumes. Then later came out with the Season one DVD. But I think its gonna be a waste if they keep selling these volumes, then later come out with the Season one. So I recommend you wait till they come out with the Season one DVD. But if you got some extra cash, this dvd is worth the price."
1,Sorry......,"In My Opinion, Married With Children was the greatest tv show ever, I loved it... Nothin can replace that show for me....I was thrilled about hearing of a dvd release, but what good is it? It should have been a Season set... Notice on the booklet of this dvd set that everyone of the shows they advertise has been given it's First Season Set, however Married With Children was the only one they gave the best of sets to...I don't give about the other collections, I just wanted this one... and this was just a huge slap in the face to the fans.yes it's nice that we finally get the banned episode.... but big deal, this should have been a seasonal set."
1,Hello?,"Helloooooooo? Is there anybody out there at Fox? Does fox NOT enjoy making money? Do Fox's shareholders invest for fun? PLEASE PEOPLE, RELEASE SEASON SETS FOR MARRIED WITH CHILDREN!!!! We WANT to BUY them!!!Somebody at Fox needs to be smacked."
1,This is an injustice to all MWC fans,"I am puzzled why anyone bothers selling TV series episodes on DVD any more without releasing the entire season at once. It may be just as well, though, since at the glacial pace Fox is releasing MASH and the Simpsons (two seasons per year), it will be about 2008 before MASH is finished and at least 2011 for the Simpsons. Even if they start full-season releases of MWC now, at that rate it would be at least 2009 to get all of them! They should take a clue from Paramount, which is releasing seven seasons of Star Trek: TNG and Deep Space Nine in their entirety in a single year. There's no excuse for Fox to be so stingy with its series other than greed or stupidity."
1,im only giving it one star because you have to...,"ok..to the ""brilliant"" people who made this...just like most of the MWC fans on here ive been waiting for a season set of MWC...i hear about this piece ...and i thought ""hey! they finaly released MWC on DVD woooooo!!!!!""and come to find out..ITS ONLY 5 EPISODES!!! ON ONE DVD TO TOP IT!!!!!i have to agree..why is it that they can release shows like ""buffy"" and ""freinds"" but they cant release MWC!!it just proves that alot of these companys dont want to spend time on real classic tv shows..i mean sure theres seasons of the simpsons,M*A*S*H,hogans heros,etc..but theres more ""modern"" seasons then there are clasics..they wont even spend time on a wonder years dvd collection!but they will for ""freinds""!so people...please save your money! hope that we will see a season of MWC on dvd..NOT 5 MEEZLY EPISODES!this is a piece of garbage..you (the fans) want a season...not this 5 episode piece of jargon!""lets rock!"" al bundy"
2,Big Letdown,"I was so excited to hear that Married with Children had come out with a DVD. I thought that this would include lots of episodes, but unfortunately it only had 5. I thought that this DVD was overpriced for a mere 5 half-hour episodes of Married with Children. However on the other hand, I wouldn't mind paying more for perhaps the entire season.Overall, I thought this DVD was okay for those who want to see a glimpse of the Bundys, but for those that were wanting to see a whole season of the Bundys, this DVD was a large letdown."
5,Pillow,"This pillow is really nice! It matches the comforter and it looks great on the bed...I bought the neck roll also, which looks great too! Enjoy!"
5,I really love this book!,"Since my child has learning disabilities, I was hooked from the very first chapter where a father tells how he wrote to his learning disabled son in such a loving, simple way that it blew my mind! What an uplifting read. I liked the simple steps in this book and I loved all the stories about real life love and anger and the big disappointments that happen to everybody. This book shows how to work through the tough times all of us face and to do that in as few as five sentences. This book is a Godsend for me. I used to be afraid to write about my feelings because I was worried that my words would come out wrong.Not any more though. From Me to You should be a big hit with everyone who has loving thoughts like I did but feels uneasy about the right way to put them in letters for other people."
5,This Little Book is A Huge Life Changing Read,"I've been wanting to talk my aging parents about the fact that they needed to get more help but I kept putting it off. I was afraid of hurting their feelings. Then I read FROM ME TO YOU and breathed easier. This book showed me how to write a letter to my parents that explained how I felt about them and described the changes I hoped they would make. They did! Of course after the fact, this whole thing seems like a no-brainer but without this book, I don't believe that I could have communicated with my parents nearly as well as I did. If you want to know how to talk about uncomfortable life events with other people in a way that doesn't make them angry or hurt their feelings - then FROM ME TO YOU can really help."
3,An expensive design catalog,"What a deception.. Mathew Barney is very talented, he's graphically great.. but he misses one point: no contact is beeing established between the character and the viewer or just between the characters, making it a very cold piece of work.. his characters look build out of plastic or simply modals saying: Okay is the photo shoot over now? So to me thats just design pictures..its as interesting as looking at a publicity book.."
2,Huh?,"As visually beautiful as the movie was it was boring, lack luster and so filled with boring symbolism that it isn't possible to follow without a companion guide. This book isn't that guide. It's a more expensive version than the movie was to see in the theatre but a lot less painful."
1,Yawn,"This has as much insight and intelligence as a 10 year old's notebook doodles. The symbols were basic and direct and the artist expects you to see insight in nothing. The actual exhibit at the Guggenheim is worse, proving there really is no central depth of understanding, just another baby boomer mentality running amuck. Maybe if the Guggenheim stopped trying to build fancy buildings and centered on ground breaking art, we wouldn't have to accept such meaningless work as meaningful. Then again, work like this just proves the Guggenheim is a sad institution worth dying. We should congratulate Mr Barney for helping them along."
1,Bigoted view of Wagner's music,"Wagner's art is too profound and rich to be viewed as Marc Weiner desperately tries to convince us it should, ie, a tool of hate propaganda. Taking Weiner too serioulsly would only impoverish our experience of Wagner's operas. Weiner is so bigoted that he can only see hate in every note of Wagner's operas. Do not let it diminish the rich experience there is in Wagner's works awating for those who want to really explore them."
1,A dishonest analysis!,"Wagner may have acquired anti-semetic feelings but this ""analysis"" is ridiculous and contrived. It is hardly an unbiased scholarly work.This is the kind of stuff that keeps racism boiling!"
5,Always a unique experience,"These were different times, they will never return exactly as they were, see the most spectacular mixed performances for slavic folk song and dance which ever were. The Red Army may return to its former glory, but we will have to wait and see if the budget can be found for the Ministry of Culture. Beginning from the Revolution as a handful of men and women who went East to inspire, instruct and entertain the Red Army (still under Leon Trotsky) this was the group who braved more than 17 nations who would attack the Soviet Union during the years it existed, always keeping the faith and always maintaining the highest order of quality of performance and art. Get this while you still can!! Someday they may be, again, what they were.. Their performances during the last few years were still spectacular, but their number has shrunk. Lets hope that Vlad and Dimitri can find the money ... somewhere ... to ensure their return to their former, unique, greatness."
3,No little gold statue for this mob,"Ever see a movie with a great story but the casting was so so or the cinematography left something to be desired? That applies to this video. If you wish to educate yourself, you could well find value in it.This is what you would expect from The Soviet Union. Big scary guys in uniform. My guess is, this was from the 1950's or 60's. Propaganda for civilian consumption. Their uniforms were an update of the ""Great Patriotic War"" (WWII) uniform typical of Stalin. They looked like the stereotypical Russian communist. A far cry from the loveable mob you might have seen in ""Red Star""To their credit, they perform well. Acrobatics abundent. I can't praise their singing since Anatoly's troupe has spoiled me. I only watched this once, not multiple times as with Red Star or Alexandrov's performance in Paris in '05. I found it to be more educational than entertaining. You might feel differently. It's not bad, it's just not my ""Brand of Vodka""."
4,"Very good analysis of the ""First Freedom Struggle""","Mr. Hibbert has rendered an excellent analysis of the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. Of course from the perspective of the natives this was a Freedom Struggle NOT a mutiny.The work is littered with good references albeit from only the British side. Why so? Simple. The corpus related to this event from the Indian side is extremely scant and also very unreliable. I recall back in 1959 my High School teacher, Mr. Luke DeSouza, advised us to take the account of the Mutiny with a fist full of salt. He noted that history written by occupiers was terribly slanted but deserved a thorough analysis.Yes, the British were racists and looked upon Indians as little more than chattel. But I dare say so were many Indians towards one another. The culture of the times was far too complex for us today to render bumper-sticker labels to either side.This book uses mostly British sources of events. Bearing that caveat in mind jump in. All in all a good read."
3,Not as Good as expected,"Since I have enjoyed other Hibbert books (e.g., his two volumes on George IV)I thought this would be the book to read on the Sepoy Mutiny. I was disappointed. It dwells at great length on the events in India as recorded by the participants. But it is very short on recording the whys and wherefore of events, and told nothing about the reaction in England. It concentrates on the trees and ignores the forest."
3,I don't know...........,"I don't know if it's Prima or what but this book is good to a certain extent. I say that because it has your basic stragties and tips but for some of the more valuable areas or secerts you'll get frustrated. Like the tomb before you fight Baraka, you do everything the book says then something is suppose to happen in order for you to continue to that area but nothing happens. Whats that all about!?!?! Anyway you could go all the way back you came, but that gets annoying because you have to find you way back. I think Prima needs to be more in-depth with their material."
1,Do they know what it means to proof-read?,"The idea of this book is fantastic, but there are so many typographical errors in the answers, examples and references. Completely frustrating. The way the math is presented (when accurate) is extremely eloquent, thought the explanations are not, and the reader must determine when the book is accurate."
1,Go elsewhere for Econ theory,"This book is outstanding at taking a difficult subject and making it even more inaccessible. Textbooks like this are why kids don't want to study Econ today. Dry writing, poor examples, and errors make this book a chore to learn from. If it were possible to give it zero stars, I would.A better resource for your rusty Calc will be Haeussler, Paul, and Wood's Introductory Mathematical Analysis - which includes a section on the Lagrangian method. This is a really great (and fun, yes, fun) calc book.A better microeconomic theory book is the Wetzstein Microeconomic Theory text.Finally, for lighter introduction check out any of the recent econ books such as ""The Undercover Economist"", ""Undressing the naked science"", etc.There are much better ways to make micro interesting to learn than from this book..."
5,Great Music!,"I really enjoyed this cd! Refreshing is a word that comes to mind, it is truly unique but I mean that in a purely good sense of the word. I would recommend this cd to anyone!"
5,The best in Tex-Mex and old fashioned country recipes,"""Mimi's Damma Hot Texas"" is a unique Texas cook book featuring 247 prize-winning, sizzlin' Tex-Mex and old-fashioned country recipes, as well as a chapter on Arts & Crafts ideas and a mini-autobiographical sketch of happy memories of life in the grand old Lone Star State of yesteryear. Recipes include favorites submitted by former Governors, Senators and other officials from Texas, and personalities including Lady Bird Johnson and Liz Carpenter. First published in 1982, ""Mimi's Damma Hot Texas"" has been republished, corrected, updated and revisited for clarity."
4,ASUN,"Love the look & feel of the comforter. Very classy. Sheets that came with it were not very nice - they were real crispy even after washing. Would rather have even paid a little bit more to get better matching sheets. Still, overall, we're very happy with the set."
4,Visual Sampler of Historic Signage,"Perfect for set designers and graphic designers who want to evoke a particular historic age from 1800 to 1940. Hundreds of colour photographs that capture not only the details of the letterforms but the texture of the material used to make the signs. With the painted signs, the flaking, fading, peeling and brushstrokes can bee seen. The book has been a source of ideas for redrawing letters to give that logotype just the right feeling and I have been encouraged to photograph any historic signs that I come across."
1,"maybe good, but...","This book's title should really read ""the 100 best (mostly loaded) mutual funds to own in america"". I would not recommend it if you are building your portfolio with no-load mutual funds. Kirk Kazanjian's book would be a good alternative."
5,Peaceful is an understatement,"Love this cd, it is background music to calm a hectic work day. Great instrumentals, great songs, a few pleasant surprises. Sorry to say I broke the cd... Happy to know I will be replacing it! Highly recommended!!!"
5,A GREAT BUY!!,"For what I paid for this poster, If I had been disappointed in the purchase I should not complain; but I love it. The picture is so glossy and it looks like a million $$$$$. I bought very expensive frames for it and put the picture on the wall at the cathedral entrance. It looks amazing. We have gotten many compliments."
2,Very Blurred,Very Blurred picture ! Wouldnt have bought if i got to see it in person ..Pros - Prompt delivery and packaging was very good ..
3,pretty decent,"first of all, the movie was just plain lame. if you thought ""kids"" was genious you'll love it, but if you've got commen sense don't waste your time.that said, don't let the bad movie fool you. the soundtrack is pretty good. it starts off with a cover of X's ""the unheard music"" that unlike most covers, actually does it justice.track two (bee bee's girl, sonic youth) is by far my favorite and the reason i wanted to hunt down this album. it's a mellow, simple song that despite not seeming to be very catchy will get stuck in your head for days.the rest of it is decent as well, but some of the songs i could do without. i get bored with bands that scream through thier songs.all in all, it's decent. even though the album cover makes me cringe it's worth a listen. it's one of those albums you won't listen to often; you'll save it for those days when you're feeling completely bored and cynical."
5,Also fits Porter Cable FR350A,Good nails for Porter Cable Model FR350A.I have had no problems with these strip nails in my nailer over the last 8 years.
2,This book is not for beginners.,"I am a Microsoft SQL Server expert and purchased this book to learn about Oracle. I purchased it because the advertising for the book said that it was for beginners. Even though I am very knowledgable about SQL databases, I found this book very hard to follow. It leaves out many important areas, and it assumes the reader knows a lot, especially about the SQL language. I would not recommend it to people who are learning Oracle for the first time."
2,"Content good, but no CD-ROM included","The content of this book is fairly good, however there is no CD-ROM included. I had not realized there was supposed to be one until the book referenced a spreadsheet. I called the publisher at that point and the person I talked to said they might have planned to have a CD, but there was not one. So, I would not spend your money on this book when there are others that actually include the information they promise."
2,"Lightweight, cursory, glosses over most topics",The book does not have the in-depth coverage that expert SQL users would expect. If you are a beginner then it may suit you just fine. There are not enough nuts and bolts for people like me who really need the complete reference book.
2,Stopped Working,"The self lock feature stopped working correctly. Sometimes it locks, usually it doesn't. And I can't lock the tape manually. The button is not meant to lock the tape, only to unlock it. So the tape measure is estentially worthless now. I've used it maybe 10-15 times."
4,QUITE FUNNY,"No one really knows how much of this ""reality"" TV is real. I am of the opinion it is more a product of crafty editing than anything else. I also happen to think the guys at American Choppers crank out some of the funniest TV today. Speaking as someone who grew up in an environment of a family owned business, and who still works in a family owned business, I can certainly understand why they act the way they do. And a side note to Grizzly, the one star review guy. Dude, you're BITTER. Your precious biker lifestyle is being exploited by some folks who want to make a little money. It's the American Way. Get over it."
3,Hailmary Wonderland...Yikes!,"Last years version of the game was okay at best. One could bomb the ball up and have your reciever snag it about 3/4 of the time. This year, this is not the case....its worse. The playaction deep bomb is over done. I have played six games on Hiesman and have broken every school & game record by nearly double. The great part is the recievers will catch the ball in stride, but the DBs fight over the ball and knock eachother out of the play! If you are okay w/ this flaw, the game is great. But when there is a money play this easy to execute, it puts the game down quite a bit. Rent before you buy, in my opinion, this flaw ruins the game."
3,Dont Buy If You Like A Passing Style of Play,"The graphics are good, so is the dynasty mode, the Heisman mode is boring but the gameplay is absolutly frustrating, espicially if you like pass plays. Your Qb will never have a high pass completion percentage, ever. If you like the option or running plays, this is your game, but the passing is horrendous. And on defense, you will never stop the long bomb or a team that runs the option everytime. I have loved the past 3 NCAA, but this one sucks."
3,Please bring back SEGA & ESPN for 2K6 and NCAA,"Can someone please have EA Sports make a realistic football game? I love college football, but this needs some work, but that goes for EA football games in general. One word, realism. Make a game that is LIKE football really is. ESPN 2K5 was the best ever. I hated to admit it, being a Madden fan from way back in the day. Example. Spin moves. If anyone in real life actually did a spin move like the ones in NCAA 06, can you say torn ACL? Don't get me wrong, I had my beefs with 2K5 (injured players, impossible passing) but the gameplay felt real. The NCAA 06 is good but needs an overhaul, improved graphics, and please fix the gameplay. I like the new features. EA 's like, if you can't beat em' buy em out. If you are gonna do that at least steal some damn features. And can I get a halftime show with real alumni like when you first turn on the game? Oh, and custom soundtracks."
2,WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MAKING THIS GAME BETTER?,"I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS GAME. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IT THOUGH WHEN I PLAYED. I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL. I DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD MAKE IT FROM GOOD(2004) TO BETTER(2005) AND THEN STINKS(2006), BUT THEY MANAGED IT SOMEHOW. THE GRAPHICS AREN'T AS GOOD, THE MUSIC STINKS, AND THE FEEL FOR REAL FOOTBALL IS GONE. IT IS LIKE AN ARCADE GAME. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I WANT MY FOOTBALL GAME TO BE AS REAL AS POSSIBLE. THIS JUST GOT MORE FAKE. RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT TO SEE WHAT I MEAN. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,Fantastic quirkiness,"I am a big XTC fan, and almost everyone mentions similarities, but I find this band different enough and worthy in the originality department. If one HAD to think this were XTC, it would be Drums and Wires (except ""Polly Brown"" sounds Dukes of Stratosphearical). This, I feel, is their best record.As someone else pointed out, ""Soft Jingo"" is haunting when it bottoms out after an assault of noise at 1:20 and briefly becomes an environmental piece of great merit. But it is just that, a moment!If someone listens to and doesn't like ""Polly Brown"", I would like to see this person quarantined from reviewing music online. ""Montebello"" and ""Another Me"" likewise shine."
4,Good book!,Elizabeth help Eva for Lila's birthday present. I think Elizabeth is very gentle's girl. They are bood friend. I think Lila's birthday party enjoy for everyone.
2,No as shown,"This product was not as shown, once I received the product i was not able to use it as intended very miss leading. Kinda pointless actually, poles did not bend at all"
3,Not what I had hoped for,"I suppose the previous reviewers are correct re: what they have said about this book. It does seem to be a great book for anyone interested in playing the Sicilian Dragon, but only as the white opponent. I find this difficult to understand because it is completely at the black opponent's discretion just which variation of the Sicilian he will choose to play once white plays 2.Nf3. If black does not move 2...d3, then having a book teaching white how to play the Sicilian Dragon seems moot, at best. As white, I maybe had 3 opponents respond 1...c5 to my 1.e4 in my lifetime. However, as black, that is the only response I give to 1.e4 and I always play the dragon variation. I had really hoped this book was going to be a book that assisted the black opponent in this game, but alas, it is not so. If that is what you are looking for in this book, do not get it. If you need help as the white opponent, then this is a very good book for you."
4,"So Many Songs, So Little Time","Man there are a ton of songs on this 3 CD set. If you want to see what's going on in an alternative pop-rock universe, this is a good place to start. While many of the songs are frankly ameteurish, this is also proof that a great many very very good songwriters/bands will probably never be heard. It's too bad. I found this CD by accident. A lot of these bands are better than what's being played on the radio, which is unfortunate for lovers of good rock (with a pop twist). Oh, well, I dig it and so do my freinds when I play (bits of) it for them. I agree with the above reviewer, The Shamus Twin's song is a knockout, but there are plenty more on here that blow away major label offerings. I'm tempted to buy more of these IPO compilations from the different years."
4,"Cool Music, great value","I bought this disc after attending many of the International pop Overthrow shows in L.A., 2004. A lot of good bands and a lot of crappy ones. But 75% of what made it onto this compilation is good stuff.Nearly all of this music is in the classic guitar driven, vocal harmony, hook laden Beatles-Cheap Trick school of rock and that ain't bad. No, that's quite good, as a matter of fact.For me the standout track is by the Shamus Twins. There's three of them, so how can they calll themselves the Shamus Twins? Anyway, their track is called ""I Hide"", and it has a very modern rock feel to it, though still Beatle-esque.I highly recommend this CD to any rock or pop lover who appreciates song craftsmanship and hooks hooks hooks!"
5,Cool to be different,"It'll take a long time to listen to this whole 3 CD set, but when you do you'll have a renewed faith that all is not lost for rock and roll/pop music. Some schlock, some predictable, some oustanding songs amongst the 63 or so tunes. Not surprisingly, I'd have to go with the other two reviewers' opinion of the standout track (I Hide, Shamus Twins), but I am a California boy, accustomed to great local bands (Byrds, Doors, Buffalo Springfield, etc.), and have some other prejudices as well!"
3,Sun Glasses,"One of the three glasses indicates a very poor quality of its workmanship.The left glass is only partially seated in its slot of the frame. I guess the glass there in is likey to drop off any moment..Since the cost of reshipping itself would be high enough, I did not deem it fit either to report this or to send it to you.I do however, appreciate the very fact of you seeking this review.Over all, the purchase is a good value for money!"
2,Eh,"Sunglasses are okay. The gold and black ones are clearly different/of better quality than the silver one. They're not even part of the same set, which is clear. Overall, not bad for the price, but disappointed on the silver pair being so shoddy."
2,Upset,"When I received these, my husband was upset because 2 of them was a little bit damage (there was a crack on the lens and the other one has a scratch). I think, before they pack or send it, they should have check the products so that the customer won't get disappointed. I know its cheap, but at least, the customer can use it first than not use it at all."
3,Rating,"Not bad, didn't know it was that small; however, it was a present for my friend, so as long as he liked it. I am good."
3,You get what you pay for,"I ordered these for my husband to wear while we were in Hawaii, that way, if he lost or broke them, we wouldn't be too sad. They looked nice, but sat a little crooked on the face. As expected, they were lightweight, and not of great quality. However, they did the job. Good size for a man's face."
1,NOT WHAT SHOWN IN PICTURE,"I bought these expecting 3 pairs of aviator sunglasses as shown in the picture, and received 3 pairs of ""john lennon style"" sunglasses. very disappointed and waste of money. they are also bent so much that if i did want to wear them, which i will never, i would not be able to. would give zero stars if possible, deceptive advertising and poor quality"
4,For the price.....,"...a very good deal. These are cheap sunglasses, price wise and construction wise. They look fine enough to wear most anywhere but i would recommend handling them gingerly if you want them to last a while. For the price, however, you cant really beat them, especially if you are prone to losing your glasses."

5,Fat Loss/Lean Wonder!,Great product for body fat % loss and leaning down! Started and within 4 weeks could see major results. Recommended for anyone but specifically those looking to lose some body fat and get in lean muscle shape!
2,ineffective,"Took this with Raspberry ketones and they had no effect. After a couple of weeks, I went back to the Super Hoodia 2000 (by Life Smart Labs, Inc.)and Reveratrol Diet (by natrol) pills I had been taking. These 2 have helped to dull my cravings and curb my appetite. These pills have made it easier to change over to the strict whole food, vegan diet that I plan to keep for the rest of my life! I've dropped 20lbs and almost cured my chonic fatigue that the drs haven't been able to help with at all! But - both of those results are from the change in diet, not the pills. The pills just make it a little easier to stick to the diet!"
2,Stick with regular CLA,I'm on a huge CLA kick since I lost 15 pounds using supplements recommended by the Dr. Oz show. I bought CLA extreme because it contains L-Carnitine which is a pricey supplement to buy on it's own. My issue with CLA Extreme is that I didn't see any results. I was afraid to up the dosage because this contains other stimulants and I didn't want to be jittery. I'm going back to regular CLA + taking a super b complex vitamin for weight loss.
1,These blades do NOT fit ALL 14-cup processors,These blades will NOT fit the Cuisinart Elite 14-cup processor. VERY frustrating as I purchased the Elite and the blades as a gift.
2,do not fit the food processor,"i'm sure i would have liked these blades better if there was a way to attach them to the food processor. they came with no instructions on how to attach them to the food processor i purchased - i only purchased them because they were suggested by the site for the cuisinart i was buying. if i had known at the time there wasn't going to be a ""how to"" guide i would never have bought them."
2,Too much effort!,"True, I am not a gourmet cook; however, I doubt that many buyers really are. These disks fall in the category of too much work for the outcome. Although I LOVE my Cuisinart and use it for nearly everything, these ""gadgets"" as I call them are simply too much hassle--installing, using, cleaning!--for everyday use. For garnishes, you can probably find smaller, cheaper tools to use and store. For cooking, my attitude is ""who cares"" what size and shape your food is? In summary, you really must have a need to spend money to put these on your kitchen ""wish list""."
1,"Cuisinart 3-Piece Specialty Disc Set, fits 14-Cup Processor","I had it returned to Amazon, as these discs do not fit the Cuisinart Elite 14-cup Food Processor (this, is the model I have). I had to visit the Cuisinart Web Site to order the proper ones (and, as the Elite 14-cup Food Processor is so new, they had all but the ""Grater"" disc currently available; therefore I ordered the two ""Specialty"" discs they have, and will order the Grater disc when it becomes available."
5,Hard Sci Fi that you can't put down,"I'm always on the lookout for good ""hard"" science fiction, so it was with great pleasure that I read this book. Nylund's confident grasp of a wide range of advanced theoretical physics is mixed with a humorous writing style and meticulous attention to story line and character. The ""T""s are crossed and the ""I""s dotted (no loose ends or deux ex machina solutions) -- and the story goes at such a clip you'll have a hard time putting it down. I'm looking forward to more from this author!"
4,Excellent book: a page turner and thought provoker.,"This book is somewhere beyond cyberpunk...if ""hyperpunk"" (mentioned in one of the above reviews) is a genre, show me where I can find more! In terms of enjoyability and mental stimulation I put Nylund almost on the level of Stephenson and Gibson. Signal to Noise was good enough that I express ordered the sequel before I finished the first book. Excellent book"
5,This book kicks butt.,This book is an sf roller coaster with each drop more dizzying than the last. The pages practically turn themselves. Can't wait to read the sequel.
2,more noise than signal,"Interesting plot premise, but I couldn't get into the style. It's not really accurate to use the phrase ""hard science"" anywhere in connection with this book. The prose took so much effort to establish imagery that it interfered with the narrative flow. I actually wound up skimming parts of the book in a semi-desperate attempt to see if it got any better. It didn't.Not my thing, although folks who enjoy Bill Burroughs might give it a whirl. For what it's worth, the next book in the series, ""A Signal Shattered"", is even more disjointed.If you are expecting hard science fiction in the sense of Niven or Clarke, stay away. I don't buy the PKD comparison, either. I've been devouring every Phil Dick book I could find since 1969. Dick wrote some muddled-reality sequences to cover when his characters were going through a crisis period, but in this case the whole book is written in that style."
4,"Looking Through Bubbles, Darkly","This is really the type of book that I shouldn't read. With enough fear of the corporate agenda being forced down our throats right now, this book presents a dark future. The fact that most of this story takes place in VR seems to confuse at first but begins to add to the drama and intrigue of the story. My favourite part of this book is when Jack makes contact with an alien species - only to find out that the corporate hostilities on earth are going on out there in the Universe, as well. Very encouraging. A dark glimpse at a possible future. I'm glad I got the sequel, ""A Signal Shattered""!"
4,Is a Super Signal of a Book!,"I bought the sequel (A Signal Shattered) first and read the first page. Then decided, I HAD TO READ THE FIRST BOOK! Mr. Nylund's vision of the future is a fantastic ""roller coaster ride"" in cyberspace that will leave you breathless. Some of the imagery was hard to conceptualize. But after dusting the cobwebs off of my imaginative processes, I found the book to be a very powerful look into the future. The multi layered plot was tight and captivating. The math was on the money too. Where's my neural implant???"
2,Endless trudging.,I stopped reading 0.75 of the way through the book.It had periods of being really good where I'd just keep reading and reading but then there'd be these long periods about the main character's virtual reality computer hacking and blah blah blah blah blah blah.Life's too short mediocre books. Skip this and read something else.
2,overrated,"Amazon relentlessly recommeded this book through its A.I. Shaky recommendation. Characters- couldn't care less. Terrible character development. Plot was ALL over the place, and not in a good way. Some interesting ideas, never fully developed."
2,Don't do it,"A lot money was thrown away on a cheap, designer-label radio of transister-radio quality. I was looking for a nice, compact, quality radio which could also receive news from the various hotspots of the world. I researched numerous travel radios in all price ranges and various web sites: Grundig's G2000A was the winner. Not.First, reception on any short-wave band is non-existent and the lo-fi FM sound was an even greater disappointment. To date, hubby, master of all bathroom radios, uses only one FM station and occasionally one AM station. Worse yet, he still travels with his Sharper Image radio, which cost half as much and has many more useful features as a radio and, of course, its quality sound and reception leave the G2000A biting the dust.Finally, the G2000A's fine leather cover with its fancy logo interferes with operation of the radio, so it rests peacefully in a closet. Which Grundig design engineer fell asleep at the wheel of this feature?"
3,A good little radio ... within it's limitations,"I bought the Grundig G2000A radio to be a light weight travel companion radio that doubles as an alarm clock. Within those boundaries it's been great. The radio also has sporty looks with the Porsche design and nifty leather cover. It picks AM and FM fine and has adequate sensitivity. As a short wave radio, it only serves to pick up STRONG short wave offerings. If you want to do some serious short wave listening, this is not the radio for you. It has old style spectrum seperations of SW1 and SW2 that do not cover the entire short wave spectrum. Most annoying was needing to make short wave entries in wavelengths vice frequencies. Most annoying indeed!I use it as a travel alarm clock/radio. It's looks are snazzy enough to make a fashion statement. It picks up any local station that I want. When I want serious short wave radio on the road, I bring my Yacht Boy 400. Shopping around can net you this radio at much less than the suggested prices."
1,"No Stars, But Not A Category","I now have my third G2000A, the first two having been returned under warranty. All three have (had)horrible AM sections which display considerable static on all but local a 50,000 watt station. Extremely disappointing and not worth purchasing."
2,It really has poor reception,"Well, I confirm with the other reviewers, that the reception quality of this radio is very poor! It looks great! I loke the design of it a lot! But sometimes the reception is useless. Plus, I do not understand why it only has 5 memory presets per band!!"
2,Grrr... all the hype...,"Well, after spending a fair amount of time looking for a small, good quality radio I chose this.I found it to be merely average: sound is mediocre - no depth; build quality is in my opinion, poor - the two halves don't join well and make it look cheap and plasticy.Only five presets per band, which one can only access by switching to that band - id est, you couldn't have 198 LW on 1 and 91.3 FM on 2, etc.The case is indeed an idea, but I found myself taking it off most of the time because it gets in the way - I prefer to stand a radio up and not lay it on its side.The design is good - in a little picture on the net; it still looks and feels cheap in the hand.For the price I feel mugged and will go for a Sony or Grundig soon and be done with it."
2,Not the best from Grundig,"I have been a shortwave buff and radio collector for many years . I have a large collection of radios . Grundig over the years has made many good products ,however , the G2000a is certainly not one of them . I will concur that it is beautifully designed ,has nice leather case and the FM section sounds decent . The AM and SW sections are practically useless . Lots of interference and noise . Only can pick up strong signals and I have experienced fading on those stations . DXers should pass it by!"
2,an ok radio,"i've had this radio for at least a dozen years. honestly, i've never been able to receive a shortwave signal on it. the speaker is small and tinny sounding. the reception on it is ok, not great. however, it looks WONDERFUL. it's really a great travel radio and looks good by the pool next to a mai tai. but at home in the kitchen, it's not so great company to me as i cook dinner. i'm looking for a newer better sounding radio."
1,Save your money!,"Beauty is deceiving. The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best, and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers, silenced by the elements! Junk...that's why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers."
2,Grundig G2000A AM/FM Shortwave Radio,"Handsome unit and convenient size but FM reception is very poor, at leastin urban areas. Too many features; not enough performance."
2,Flash But No Substance,"The Grundig G2000A is like the pre-TV series Anna Nicole Smith: hot looks, feels great, but not something you want to have around day in and day out.To be sure, it's one of the nicest-looking radios you'll find, but as a shortwave receiver, it lacks a lot: doesn't tune the whole SW spectrum (why these radios just don't cover the full 1.7- 30 MHz range is beyond me) sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired, and selectivity (ability to separate closely-spaced stations) is in adequate. Plus, the audio is on the tinny side. For the $80 or so bucks you will normally pay for this, you can do much better. Probably Grundig's worst model."
3,Surprised to find this on Amazon,"Queue up is a dark mixture of rock music and electronic effects. The whole thing is kind of quirky and strange. The lyrics are either weird introspective numbers or social commentary. 'I hate you Mr. Einstein' is quite amusing. The vocals are definitely quirky. The whole thing is very dark. Some of the choruses are very catchy, like the catchy rocker 'On the edge'. That particular song has some realyl cool effect. There is some good energy in some of the songs. If you want a bitter, dancable rock album then this might be what you're looking for. The closest comparison I could make from more well known bands are some James Young songs for Styx, 'what have they done to you' and 'heavy metal poisoning'."
1,THIS GAME DESERVES ZERO STARS!!!!,"Without a doubt, this has to be the worst skateboarding game ever. I'm ashamed to admit that I own the thing. The graphics, physics, controls, and overall gameplay are HORRIBLE.Andy McDonald should have stuck with his skating partner and appeared in Tony Hawk instead. How embarrassing!Run from it! Run!"
2,Lameboarding,"this game [stinks]. I love skateboarding games too, but this one [stinks]. Configuration of the controls is almost impossible. The graphics aren't that good either. If you want a good skateboarding game, go with Tony Hawk 1, 2, 2x, or 3. Those are much better and more challenging. .... the 2 stars i gave it are for the soundtrack only."
5,Delightful Harvest of Memories,"This book truly is a harvest of memories. It shows what a wonderful human being Mr. Kelley was. After reading the book, you will get to know his most beautiful and genuine feelings and how much he enjoyed his life, his career and his friends. This book is a real treasure for all of Mr. Kelley's fans.Kris Smith is a remarkable, courageous person. No doubt she was a blessing for the Kelleys, and a role model for all of the people who get to read this book. The admiration I feel for her now is limitless.This book will make you laugh, and it will certainly make you cry. It shows how life should be lived, how friends should be loved, treasured and taken care of, and how important family is.You will not be disappointed. It will change your perspective of life in a positive way."
5,Friendship,"A wonderful chronical of the developement of a friendship. This book tells how actors are very different from the persona projected on screen. Deforest Kelley was an actor but also a very kind down to earth person. He experienced all the things in life we all do. In his final days all the kindness he had shown in life was returned to him. A very heart warming book. On another level, the book will be very helpful to those faced with having to care for a dear loved one slowly slipping away. DeForest & Carolyn Kelley were loved by all whose lives they tuched but they loved each other even more."
2,Not as Advertised,The product was fine but the retailer falsely advertises. Their price is 30% less than you can find anywhere ($14) but it all makes sense when you receive the product; half size. I will no longer patronize a company that will not advertise with transparency.
5,This one of the most sincere and beautiful recordings ever.,This thought provoking and musically talented band provided us with a real gem.. We as a people should thank them! Do yourself and your friends a favor and buy mommyheads!!!!
4,"Simple lyrics, complex harmonies, not just fluff, though","Great light background music AND great for serious listening, too!"
2,Meh.,I don't know what I was thinking before. This album champions mediocrity. Three *good* songs harldy make an album worth while.
3,It's good but...,"The detailed maps are great but guys...no use looking for a road map of Maine, I mean the whole state as it doesn't exist: incredible! so do order a map in addition!!"
5,best map book around,Delorme makes just the best atlas around. We have them for about half the United States. Every single road and navigable path are on these maps and you just cannot get lost!
2,Delorme Maine Gazetteer from Amazon.com,"One of the Gazatteers arrived with pages out of order. No big deal for me, I live about 15 miles from the Headquarters of Delorme. They gave me a new one and the Gazatteers are great with pages in order. Others would have to pay shipping to and from Delorme.Mine were the 2011 version. Delorme Headquarters didn't seem surprised at the page order problem and said there will NOT be a 2012, but will be a 2013, SO THEY APPEAR NOT TO BE UPDATED YEARLY. I have used them for over 22 years and love them with pages in order.Go to a book store, pay the 19.99 and check the freakin' pages.Hareem, not of arabia."
5,Gazetteer is always great,"Many years ago I developed the habit of purchasing and studying the state's Gazetteer when ever I went hunting or fishing out of state. I purchased this one for a trip to Maine I'm planning. As always, the Gazetteer provides an abundance of helpful information and a better understanding of the distance relations from point A to point B. I use all the other modern navigation gadgets too but I would be lost without my Gazetteer."
2,Blah w/ a couple laughs,"I read the Girl's Guide and loved it. I expected something good from Bank. I read it in a couple of days. I was disappointed, esp the ending. She has a few good insights and that's about it."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed this book!,"I recently picked up The Wonder Spot from a bargain table at a local bookstore - having never heard of the author Melissa Bank, plus the fact that the book had been relegated to the bargain table, I didn't expect it to be anything more than a bit of fluff - perfect to read whilst on the beach. I loved this book - the further I got into it the more I adored the main character, Sophie Applebaum, and felt like she was somebody I knew. When I got half way through I was starting to dread coming to the end of this book. The other characters in the book were all wonderful and I enjoyed the relationship she had with her brothers, in particular Jack, their witty repartee and Jack's witty one liners had me laughing out loud (Sophie: ""You never ask me any questions"". Jack: ""Sorry. Do you have the time?"") and the visit that Sophie, her mother and brother make to their Grandmother was priceless. Thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
4,Wonder why it didn't do better,"I really liked The Wonder Spot. I found it engaging, fun, easy to relate to, and thoroughly readable. I was hooked from the word go, and found Sophie totally likable and human. Being roughly the same age as Sophie, I recalled fashions, circumstances and decades she lived through, sometimes laughing, sometimes cringing in recognition. I'm curious as to why this book didn't do better. I enjoyed it and couldn't put it down."
1,i don't get it,"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with all the comments about how this book is "" deep and meaningful."" I found it to be extremely boring and anti-climactic. Like I was reading a journal of a person with a very non-interesting life. I hated how the book shifted in all different directions with each chapter. This book could have been written in 2 paragraphs, honestly. I guess I only appreciate books that actually keep me awake."
1,What happened,"After I read her first novel, I couldn't honestly see all the hype behind it. The prose was rather pedestrian and the characters seemed rather flat. I was given Wonder Spot as a gift and so I thought I would give Banks another shot. To be honest, I read half of the book and felt as if I were reading about the same characters as in her first novel but merely the names had been changed. Banks does not write with verve or insight but rather with caution-as if she is afraid to take chances and write from the heart. She relies upon a formula that in my view barely worked the first time. This book is a beach book at best; ie; let this one float away. A real disappointment"
2,Where's the book?,"'Read it, didn't really like it. 'Left me wondering why the author wrote this as it was not as good as her first effort. The writing jumped around a lot and made me wonder if all the reader is supposed to ""wonder"" is when the main character would find a man. Yes, that was what the author conveyed to me as the ""wonder spot"" and resultingly - ""yuck!"""
1,Not a very good read.....,Women vaguely dissatisfied with everything proceeds to plod through her life for over two hundred pages.It really isn't worth reading. Banks first book was a much better attempt. This is a poor second novel.
1,What a waste of paper!!,This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read! The charachters are terribly under developed.It goes absolutely nowhere. How it got the positive reviews I will never know. I can't believe a publisher would have even printed this one. Take my advice don't bother .
1,Wonder Spot? More like: Wonder (Why It Was Published) Spot!,"I am perplexed that in this modern day of printing, errors such as this can still occur, but I'm missing several pages of The Wonder Spot starting after page 134 (jumps to 199). It then repeats 60 some-odd pages (263-324) in the back.I was looking for a quick, brainless read, and this was it, but the missing pages reminds me of receiving a book on CD with a major scratch in it, thus preventing me from moving forward... I think this is fate's way of telling me to not waste my time with this shallow drivel.I'm not above occassionally picking up a book of chic lit ilk, but was not impressed with The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, and am equally unimpressed with Melissa Banks' sophomore effort. It's too bad, because the editor who wrote the back jacket sell copy reeled me in with the description. Unfortunately it must apply to another book on their list."
2,Didn't like it...,"This book left me cold. I was really looking forward to reading it because I love the Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing and count it as one of my favorite books, but it just did not have the magic that Girls Guide did. I got so annoyed with the main character and could not relate to her or find something that I found charming or neat about her. It just seemed like with this book Melissa Banks wrote whatever came off of the top of her head with no rhyme or reason to it."
4,Two complaints,"1. To me Banks made the patents shallow & see through in the beginning, and then tried to pump them up closer to the end. Maybe in an effort to get us to like them more.2. I also felt that she set Robert & Jack both up to be great characters then let them fall flat later on in the book. Sophie kept in constant contact with both brothers, but nothing more is known about them as ""people"" only the events that take place in their life.Other then these two complaints I really enjoyed the story and felt that Sophie was finally on the right path @ the end."
3,More of the same but less satisfying.,"Throughout the novel I kept waiting for ""Sophie"" to marry Max, like the Sophie of the previous Bank novel. I was confused. Was this the same Sophie or was it just a weird conwinkie or did Bank just not know that many names? She repeated names and situations and family dynamics, right down to the beginning taking place at a beach. The character seems exactly like Jane except her name is Sophie. Sophie/Jane both work in publishing and both don't seem to know how to do anything or be of any use to anyone. In the previous novel it worked because I hadn't seen it before, but it's old and tired now and Sophie was so irritating. She reacted and never acted which I suppose is at the core of Bank's style.It's a real disappointment.I gave it three stars because her prose is excellent and it's clear she is a brilliant writer. She is funny and funny is DIFFICULT and for that alone it is worth three stars."
3,Not much of a second novel,"Not good, not bad. Sort of a blurry shadow of Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, with less engaging stories. Sophie's character is hopeless, she doesn't know what she wants, so it is hard to root for her. I like the short story format, but the individual stories lack a consistent structure and overall don't have much of a climax or a conclusion. Some good one liners though, not a bad way to spend a day when you have nothing else to do."
1,UGH,"I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below. I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible. This book is just so boring, no spunk or humor; it just fell flat. I am also finding the Jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days...aren't there any other ethnic groups to be written about?"
3,Not really a novel,"Be careful what you wish for...I'm not usually a big fan of short stories (which often seem to end just as they're getting really interesting, like movie fade-outs), but I thought THE GIRLS' GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING had so much style and insight that I hoped Melissa Bank would go on to write a novel that fully developed the life of a central character. While THE WONDER SPOT, which focues on young, single Sophie Applebaum, seems to promise that, what it actually delivers is another series of vignettes. Sure, the vignettes connect to each other, but they leave gaps and never really go anywhere, which I actually found more frustrating because I expected more plotting and character development this time.Melissa Bank continues to have style, but I'm afraid her storytelling still seems limited to short takes, rather than the satisfying novel that I was hoping for."
5,snap shot,"I'm one of those shallow people who pick books by whether the author looks interesting...so, I'm 1/2 way through ,thinking its a boring book about boring people when suddenly I thought;is she being funny?She IS funny! A good read!"
2,Boring. I LOVED her first book; was totally disappointed by this one.,"It's too bad. I've tried reading different parts of this book at different points throughout the past 2 weeks and I can't be compelled at all.Not interesting, not funny.After her first book, ""The Girls' Guide To Hunting and Fishing"", Melissa Bank became well-known as a very funny, witty, interesting writer. That's one of my favourite books of all time.But nothing in this book interested me, and nothing made me laugh. It's sort of a different style, and at some points (the first chapter) I felt like she was trying too hard. At other points, I felt like she wasn't trying at all.Maybe when it comes out on paperback I will give it another try. Perhaps I personally didn't like it because the style is so different from the first.I'm not sure why so many critics like this one. She's a critical darling now I guess."
2,I feel old,"""Girls' Guide"" was the first chick lit book I ever read, and I remember thinking at the time how unrealistic these books are...that these women can ""summer"" in their families' homes in Martha's Vineyard, and they end up getting jobs in NYC with no real problem. That's just not something I could relate to. And as a writer myself, I thought it must be really easy to get published, since all these chick lit books are the same.""The Wonder Spot"" was an interesting idea, but I felt like she was lapsing into the same-old, same-old. The characters weren't realistic and didn't hold down realistic jobs or have realistic money situations or realistic vacations. More than anything, as I read and watched Sophie's life drift by, I myself became more aware of how life can just pass you by without your doing anything worth much. I'm 28, and after reading this book, I feel like Ive aged 15 years and like the best part of my life is already behind me."
3,The Mother of Chic Lit's Ugly Step Daughter,"I had high hopes for this novel after The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing. Melissa Banks if the Mother of Chic Lit and I respect her pivotal role in the genre (that has completely gone down hill, might I add). There were definitely parts about this I liked, but it unfortunately fell short.Respectable- I liked Sophie, the main character; her wit and humor were right up my alley.- I loved the close-knit aspect that the main character shared with her brothers; it was wholesome, but not saccharine.- The writing itself is good- this is one of the main things that sets her apart from the rest of the chic lit authors.Except- This is obviously a coming of age novel, which is fine, but I just felt like it was a little lost (like the main character). It seemed as if Bank just wasn't sure when to end it and kept going... and going..It's not, by any means, but probably more average than good. A quick read... good for the airplane or poolside."
3,I'm a bit confused with this one,"It has all the makings of a great chick lit novel, like Melissa Bank's first. But something is missing in The Wonder Spot. Maybe I just didn't connect with the main character. Maybe it's because she reminded me too much of Jane, the beloved heroine of ""The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" (Bank's wonderfully written debut novel). I would highly recommend reading that one first. This one was a nice read, but didn't leave me filled with any wonderment."
5,I loved this book-just as good as the first one!,"This book is in a lot of ways similiar to the 'Girls Guide..' but I assume that if you liked the first one and want to read the second, you are looking for something that is going to be similiar. The writing is clever and the characters relatable. I laughed out loud throughout the book and was sad when I reached the end because I could have kept on reading. I dont know why there are people that gave such low scores for this book because I truly enjoyed reading it as much as Bank's first and I think this will be one that I read again. I suggest reading it for sure instead of letting bad reviews sway you, thats what I decided to do and I am glad that I did!!"
4,It Made Me Smile,"Just this moment finished The Wonder Spot. Oddly enough, it left me feeling somewhat melancholy--which is a surprise because it made me smile most of the time I was reading it and laugh out loud many times.I won't recap the story--I hate it when people ruin the plot...Suffice it to say that Melissa Bank's character Sophie, is so likeable, so human, so wry and loveable, that you want only what's best for her. What left me feeling melancholy was the ending--I wanted something different for her--but actually, the ending was quite realistic given the way she had played out the hand that life dealt her.I particularly enjoyed the ""banter"" she had with her brothers. I found myself wishing I had brothers like hers, albeit they were both flawed.In summary, this is ""literary"" chick-lit with many keen observations about human nature. I was very entertained by it."
3,80 pages too long,"I think Melissa Bank is a fine writer, and enjoyed the writing and style. Shame she didn't really come up with a good story. The whole thing just got to be kind of boring. It just kept going on and on and on and on-- without the character really growing up or looking up or changing or evolving. I don't know if it was supposed to cover the 10 years from age 20-30, but you'd think she'd get a clue or somehow mature.I didn't hate the book, but I didn't love it. I'll look for other books by Melissa Bank because I like her style-- and hope for a much better storyline. Or plot. Or some character development. Or something. There's a writer, then there's a storyteller. Maybe Melissa Bank will evolve to become both."
3,Drifting and floating,"Sophie Applebaum is a river, a small one, nothing too ambitious, nothing too rapid. She slides past friends and family, watching as they remain on the muddy banks while she moves on, never stopping for long with any one of them. She eddies into pools on occasion, swirling around a lover or a childhood acquaintance, but always flowing on. There is Eric and Ian and Seth, Bobby Guest (""He's a bad one. Everybody has a Bobby Guest story."" and Neil. Sophie can be quietly witty, but can't get up to get to work on time, can't settle on a career, can't seem to keep any constants in her life other than her brothers. While it was pleasant enough drifting along with her for a while, I will not be able to remember any more of this than I do of the author's previous book ""A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing""."
4,Algebraic Statistics for Computational Biology,"This text has provided technical examples and learning material for a complicated mathematical/biological/computer science topic. The text is not for introductory purposes, but when used for graduate level course of algebraic statistics, it has proven useful in a variety of manners. The text offers a great overview of the field of algebraic statistics, along with several chapters showing applied examples of the field. This text is recommended for graduate to post graduate level students interested in the field of algebraic statistics."
3,i agree with p.a. clark,"the story was lacking. its ok to be imaginative and show what its like to be a kid, but if that exceeds, then it gets vague. and thats what i felt. also, it didnt seem like there was any difference from the main characters younger age and his older self, it left me viewing him as a mental patient. the graphics are pretty, the music was beautiful, and that last song reminded me of ""neverending story""."
3,Children of the Northlights: more for adults intersted in Lapp culture,"I bought this for my 5 year old grand daughter. She liked the pictures but found a lot of it a little baffling - like taking a sauna, for example. (We live in Phoenix: we live in a sauna, so why seek one out.). Nice art work, but more for older children interested in this specific topic."
3,A Bit Dated,"Didn't think I would enjoy this info. video when it started. The guide's hair and clothing are dated for sure but he does know his history of Charleston, SC. He has details and facts not usually published in tour books. It's not a video that tells you what tours to take in Charleston but the actual history of Charleston which is very interesting. The Visitor's Welcome Center is a must for your visit and tours."
2,Could be a lot better,"First of all, this only covered part of LA. I guess this is the part most people want to see but I have no idea since they don't even talk about half the city. The maps are very anoying. Rather than giving one big map they break it all up into a bunch of little ones that don't even connect together. You will need a better map than the ones in this book. Too many boring stories and useless anecdotes. I don't want a history lesson. I don't want story time. I want a guidebook. I want to get a summary about what each place is like. There have to be better guide books than this."
5,public idea,i seen this book atlast and i know that is about ultrasonic testing and it is a compelet refrence in ut matter.
2,very bland,"a un-interesting mixed up tale of a baseball team who is ineffective at first but, like all predictable stories from a childrens author, finishes first. the ingredient of a wierd talking girl from upper new york barely adds to the comedy, and korman, as they say in baseball, definently strikes out in this book."
3,Hourglass,"The hourglass looks good and is accurate when working properly. On occassion (about 5% of the time), the sand gets jammed in the neck of the hourglass and the timepiece ceases to function. This is annoying. I have to guess, however, that this is a sample defect rather than a problem across the board with the product. If my hourglass did not have this defect, I would have given it 5 stars."
1,Hourglass review,"This hourglass is poorly made - the blown glass is loose from it's holder, and leaks sand."
5,a hit with my wife and the kids,"We keep the hourglass by the piano. It's decorative, and helps the younger kids conceptualize how long an hour is and keeps them focused on whatever you want them to do for an hour."
1,False Advertising.,"Not only did it take them 4 months to ship out the hourglass, it looks nothing like the picture. I ordered it specifically in mind of the photograph and not of the product description. The photo shows an oak wood finished hourglass with natural tan sand. What I recieved was a cherry finished wood with white sand. i know that the description says cherry which makes perfect sense and my fault on that part but shouldn't the photograph portray the actual hourglass and not what's on the box. I had bought it as a birthday present for my mother and not only was in 4 months late but it wasn't anywhere near the colour I wanted it to be. I don't think I'll be using Amazon for awhile. False Advertising at it's finest."
4,Good product,Beautiful and mine takes a consistent 58 minutes and 40 seconds to run. The only is that the spindles that hold the top and bottom together are a little loose.
3,It's okay,My husband really wanted an hour glass and this was the only one I could find in a wood finish. Pros: the entire glass and sand section is great- well made and I think the sand prety much lasts an hour. Cons- the spindles were loose so my husband had to take the whole thing apart and glue the spindles back in. So now its pretty perfect except for a small crack in the base that was there when it came. Overall I'm satisfied with it now... A little pricey though.
3,"good, but not great",I like this album. A few songs are great. Many songs move in and out of hot grooves. Good for sampling but entire album may not hold up after a few listenings.
2,110v Only,"If purchasing outside of the USA, be warned. This unit only runs on 110v.Nowhere in the description does it mention the voltage requirements."
4,get the 'other' one....,"this is a public service. You are wondering if you should get the Cusinart or the Braun coffee bean grinder? Trust me, I bought both and the 'other' one is the correct choice. This one has a short cord and a cap that is smaller than the bean reservoir. The 'other' one doesn't have these problems.You are probably thinking what happened to the 'other' grinder. Well, I decided, after 2 years, to grind a blend of spices for the BBQ. I did this about 3 or 4 times, and the grinder stopped grinding. I wonder why they called it a 'coffee bean grinder'? DuhhhSincerely, JCG, tampa"
1,FAILED IN TWO MONTHS,"After two months of use, about twice a week, it stopped working. The warrantee is useless. It would cost about as much to ship it there and back as to replace it. Also, Cuisinart customer service is about as useful as the cable company's customer service."
1,Disappointed!,"This grinder has a small capacity [not as advertised]. If you follow directions, it will only grind enough for 4 cups at a time. Also, for some reason it generates a static charge and there is coffee dust all over the counter after emptying it. The cord is stiff and the cord storage is inconvienient. Finally, it is much more noisy than my old one."
5,works well for herbs and spices,"I've never used it for coffee (I don't drink the stuff), but this little gem does a super job grinding spices and dried herbs. I use it even for grinding chunk cinnamon."
5,Love it,I thought I had ordered a used product but it turned out to be brand new and bang on time. Great stuff!
1,"Weak Motor, Weak Design, Weak Coffee","I have been pretty happy with Cuisinart products. Their waffle iron is the best, and the food processor is 20 years old, and works great. Is this another brand that got bought, and gets slapped on cheap Chinese products? Seems like at has happened a lot. This coffee grinder is toast after two grinds today. And of course, like an idiot, I tossed the ""instructions"" and ""warranty papers"". C'mon you really need instructions to use this? The claim of 12 cup capacity is bogus. The Keurig people ""could"" say it has a 1/2 gallon capacity and that is true..but one cup at a time. This thing makes an inconsistent grind, and produces weak coffee. It should be an embarrassment to the company..and our country for not being able to manufacture a stupidly simple product as this. Buh bye Cuisinart!"
1,Cooked Goose,"I received this product through Cuisinart's rebate after purchasing their coffeemaker DCC 2650 at Bloomingdale's. The coffeemaker was mediocre and I actually purchased an Aerobie aeropress in the end. But going back to the grinder, I'm glad that I spent zero dollars on the product and it worked okay during the first 10 grinds. The cup is very small and I had a large can of beans to grind.Afterwards, it was dead. Didn't even sputter and die, just went dead after using the grinder as directed. I suggest you spend the money on something else rather than this product. I've never had any bad experiences with Cuisinart before and is disappointed that this grinder would go so quickly. I'll just stick to grinding my beans at the local supermarket before bringing it home."
1,Brand killer,"Failed after one use. Put me right off the Cuisinart brand - if they make junk, they make junk. In my experience, Krups is a reliable product."
3,Could be a bit larger,Product works as expected but if you like to make 10 or more cups of coffee at once you will find the grinding chamber too small on this unit. I also don't like the lid which has a plastic inner ring that the coffee beans like to get stuck in. These beans make it tough to close the top so you can engage the start switch and won't get ground up if you do manage to start it. It is also difficult to dump the ground product into the coffee maker as the lid won't hold all the coffee so you have to unplug the unit and tip the whole machine over to empty it. On the plus side unit has plenty of power and has a reasonable quality feel to it.
2,Don't Overfill,"I thought it would go well with my new Cuisinart Coffee Maker. It seems to take longer than my old Krups unit. If you overfill it simply won't grind the beans. Once you get the hang of the amount of beans to place in, it works OK but still seems to take longer than other grinders."
3,Coffee grinder,"Grinder works well, but does too little at a time. Appears to be difficult to keep clean."
1,Defective,"I bought this coffee grinder from another store. Before I even used it, (but already bought it), I had reservations about this product because of all the bad reviews. 12 1star rating out of 25 4 star ratings is not a huge difference. I honestly thought that mine would come out fine because what are the chances of me getting something defective right and I also trusted the Cuisinart brand because most of my appliances are from Cuisinart and I love them. However, during the first use, it tripped off the electrical outlet!!! I tried it over and over again, and it really does do it most of the time. I think Cuisinart outsourced this product to a manufacturer in China with no quality control and the whole batch probably was defective or something, coz I saw a bunch of them at a discounted price. I'm returning this and looking for another brand this time."
1,Expected more,I expected more from this brand. There is no way to detatch the ground coffee and pour into a filter. You have to turn the entire appliance over. Not a hassle I can handle as I stumble to get my am java.
1,MESSY POOR DESIGN,This product is poorly designed and makes a huge mess every time you use it. It makes having your coffee a chore instead of a pleasure.
2,Bad Lid Design,"The lid for this grinder has a weird double wall, and coffee gets between the walls. It is very hard to clean. The only work-around we have found is to load and assemble it upside-down. Then, you can turn it over and grind without too much problem with the seal. Our old Krups never had any such problem. I also bought a Cusinart hand mixer recently, because it used to be a good brand. Both were fair to poor. Be warned."
2,Nice grind- No capacity,"The positive: This grinder produces a uniform grind.The negatives: I could only add half the capacity of beans.The first time I filled the grinder and was grinding for the 30 seconds the manual instructs you to, something plastic inside got very hot and started smoking. So, I started doing two grinds to get the amount of coffee I like.A week ago,a friend of mine was making coffee, and not knowing the grinder's capacity limitation, filled it full with beans and burned out the motor.Anyways, if you like strong coffee don't buy this grinder. If you like lighter strength coffee this is a good grinder because of its consistent grinding of the beans.We bought this to replace it!Breville BCG450XL Ikon Conical Burr Grinder"
3,The basin for the beans needs to be bigger...,"This product is just OK - it works, but you can barely get the top back in when you put the beans in...."
5,it grinds!,"super affordable and grinds the beans in seconds. haven't had any problems yet. super easy to use. even if it breaks, i'd probably buy another one to replace it. quick and easy."
2,Too small for coffee - Works OK for spices,"This grinder does not really handle 12 cups worth of beans - not even 12 6oz cups. I would put the limit at 8 cups. Additionally, there is no removable cup. While that it is not a big deal, it does make it harder to pour and clean. Since this grinder wouldn't work for our coffee needs, we started using it as a spice grinder. It works just fine for that purpose."
5,A Gem of a Little Grinder!,"Very happy with this little grinder! Performs just as good as I expected it to do and the price is super! This grinder does way better than a Krups and another brand I bought and returned! Not noisy, easy to operate and wipe clean! Thanks Cuisinart!"
4,Inexpensive way to grind your own beans,"Nice little inexpensive coffee mill. It allows you to grind coffee all the way down to a powder if you want to. It grinds fairly evenly, but not as well as a good burr mill. It cleans out easily and also works great for grinding other herbs and spices, and making for making meat rubs. It's fairly loud, so use it after everybody is awake (or as a morning wake up call). It is probably the best buy for under $20. If you have never ground your own coffee, this is a great way to get a good cup of coffee for little cost. It also takes up very little counter space and it's available in colors to match just about any kitchen."
1,Bad design/good looks,"great look but very bad design....just the tiniest ""thing"" that engages the motor when you push the button down.....worked 3 times then failed to connect. I have a 10 year old ""Mr. Coffee"" that does extremely well, although it has high EMF's and to keep my hand away from the strong EMF's I use the butt end of a wooden spoon to push down the button while grinding coffee....."
2,limited capacity,"It has very limited capacity, only one and a quarter ounces. You can grind only enough beans for a half pot at a time."
1,Wasted Time,"Having read the preview of ""The Autobiography of God"" I can unequivocally say, ""Don't waste your time."" Dr. Harwood has already wasted too much of his own time writing this useless tome. If you want to question the value or bias of this review, I would simply ask you to compare my review of Dr. Harwood's book with his review of the book ""Gunning for God"" by John Lennox, which is a much more worthwhile read than this waste of time. My review here has at least as much value as his does."
5,Amazing Voice,Wonderful voice. We need to see more English songs from this artist in the US. Her newest video is amazing.....Sertab Erener is amazing.
1,Worst granola ever had,"I bought 4 18oz packs of this granola and was extremely disappointed. I had used Red Mill stuff before and liked it so tried this. It is under-toasted so it tastes like paste... like raw oatmeal. It says it is Almond... but try to find almonds in the mix... if you look extremely close, you will find a couple tiny white flakes that are apparently almonds.Avoid this stuff!"
5,Another great recipe,"It's hard to find a BRM that I don't like (yes, there are a few) but this is a great, simple granola."
2,Not too crunchy,"This granola was not crunchy or clumpy enough to use as my family's go to granola, but I can use it as an ingredient for other baked goods. Plus I didn't like that it wasn't organic."
3,Not as good as other flavors,"I would like to return this, but Amazon does not allow it.This flavor is muddy and jut plain unpleasant. My wife thinks so too.Sorry, other flavors like apple strawberry are fine."
2,Not yummy,"The oats don't taste like they are cooked enough, even with milk (or heating with berries.... & then adding milk) this is a tough cereal to choke down. There are slivers of almond in here, but not a lot."
1,Honey Almond Granola,I will start off saying that my wife loves this stuff but I hate it! It is nothing more than dry oats and almond slivers in a bag. I am a huge fan of granola but not this stuff. The Bob's Red Mill Apple Blueberry is where its at. That is the best stuff I have every had. Granola wise that is.
3,Diehard Aretha Franklin fans may consider this dvd,"Average on video quality, however, that's understandable considering the age of the concert and technology at that time. The sound quality is above average and muscial charge performance by the queen of soul. ""Live at the Philmore West"" remains my favorite live Aretha Franklin concert."
4,Any of the Queen of Soul's Concert videos are jewels,"Aretha Franklin - Live at Park WestI bought the DVD referenced and wish I could just swoop in and buy this one: Live In Chicago. Never disappointed with anything Ms Franklin has done. There's so few live concert videos to enjoy and Aretha doesn't travel. Perhaps we might be treated to a few songs for the Inauguration in January, I hope so. Watching Aretha on stage: ""the Queen of Soul"" is all one can think."
5,A Perfect Evening with an American Troubador,"This DVD captures Jerry Jeff at his best. Beatiful ballads,some rockers like Red Neck Mother and Trashy Women and just enough stories and B.S. to keep it from being boring. He's in great voice and it's just him and his guitar. Settle in with your favorite beverage, a good companion and enjoy this intimate concert."
3,What happened to the plot????,"It seemed like the end of this book was written by a different person who wanted to finish it off in a hurry. It made no sense (to me) for the book to be titled based on Ben Martin, and then his plot line was abruptly cut off. The book had all the makings for a surprise finish, but doesn't follow through. Too many of the characters are left with weird loose-ends. I'm sure this is because there is a sequel (I'm very new to her books), but I'm not sure I want to keep buying them if they all end like this."
5,The Englisher (Annies People),A good read. Shows that differences can be overcome with compatibility.
2,Like a soap opera you can skip this one...,"I love Bev. Lewis' books. This one was a let down for sure. I don't know if it is a new style of writing or just a turn of bad taste for the publisher pushing for a book. Every book you read has a beginning building on a plot, which was the first book. It is wholly exceptable to have the first book in a series not come to some conclusion. But to have an entire second book, over 300 pages, drone on and on, add new conflicts but bring no end to even one single plot, twist, conflict, snippit of information, is not in good writing taste. This book reads like a soap, ever thinkening, but never ending. It was seriously a waste of 4 hours to read. Just buy the brethern, to find out the end."
5,The Englisher (Annie's People),This was a great book as all of Bevery Lewis's books are. I can hardly wait till the next book comes available.
3,Ugh,"Not as good as the first. A couple of things irked me about this book.1) WHY did Louisa leave Paradise and go back to Colarado??? She seems to be fairly content, maybe becoming less so, but still getting a job nearby and then she leaves. And what part exactly did Sam play in this? Since he had expressed no desire to join the church, why couldn't they have gotten a place in town and pursued a relationship? And what exactly changed in Louisa to make her want to go back to Colorado? I never could figure that out.2) Why did Ben go back to Kentucky? (Other than Annie breaking his heart?) If he felt such a strong connection to the area, why not stay? And why didn't Annie contact him when she moved out of her parents' house? She had to have known that might have changed his mind. Weird.The more I read this book, the less I like it."
2,Original male control freaks!,"This was a very upsetting story to me. How could intelligent women possibly live like this, even ifthey were raised in this sort of environment? I would wonder if they are even aware that they live in the America--""the land of the free""!Hopefully the next one which is the last of this series will leave me with a different attitude."
3,The Englisher,Sow hard reading and not a story I would recommend to anyone.My sister read it and she seemed to think it was okay but not great.
4,Amish Life,Good book. Simple to read and interesting insight to the Amish lifestyle. I have read the whole series of Annie's People.
3,ok followup,I am ok with this followup. The characters are still good. The plot does have a twist. The fact of a left-for-dead character makes Lewis seem a little like she's running out of ideas.
5,Can't go wrong,Can't go wrong with Beverly Louis. Gripping from beginning to end! I have enjoyed every book of hers I have read.
3,Sort of Interesting,"My first time to see either of these. I love the 50s classics, but I really wouldn't put these in the same class. Invaders From Mars I would describe as ""Disney goes B movie."" Its strictly for non adults. Boring for the most part. Strange Invaders is a little more serious, but for the first half it drags. The audio seems a bit over compressed at times and can be difficult to follow. It is at best ""sort of interesting."" I can't really recommend either film for serious sci-fi fans, and if you miss these, you won't be missing much."
2,Dont try to remake a classic,Paid way to much money for this. If had to do it again I would not. Dont waste your money as I did.
3,Good Sci Fi Movie don't see often on TV,"I am a Sci-fi Buff since I saw my first ones at the saturday movies in the mid 50's! Although I never saw this one(Strange Invaders) at the movies, I did see it on television along time ago. So I was happy to find it after all these years. Great to see it again! It takes a while to build up the suspense, but once it gets going you get envolved and are willing to wait to see what happens. Special Effects are on a average classic Sci Fi level; but still liked it. I have always liked Paul Le Mat and thought him a very under rated actor. So I especially enjoyed seeing him again. A milder, enjoyable Sci Fi movie that most people will like."
4,strange invaders,"i remember seeing this movie on tv when i was a little girl. it was scary. but, now it's just a movie i collected for sentimental reasons. the second movie invaders from mars i never saw before. it was ok. movie was in great condition. thanks amazon.com."
5,Oklahoma Atlas & Gazetteer,"This map of Oklahoma is invaluable for uses such as finding camping spots, or finding land to buy. The map will tell you whether a particular area is forested, or pasture land, or desert. And it has all the small county roads and lakes. We have used similar maps of Texas and Arkansas so many times, we are happy to now have a good map of Oklahoma.Online maps are great, but this is an excellent, detailed map available while traveling. We often like to take the road less traveled by. :)"
5,The best I've found so far.,These Delorme state atlases are the best paper maps of a state. I have about 15 states so far. Much more detailed than a fold up map. I'd rather have these than a GPS. The only negative is they are a little too big to be carrying on a motorcycle trip.
3,"Functional, but no better than other maps on the market","We used this map for the first time last weekend. It was mostly clear and we managed to locate our position in the center of a large town without too much trouble. Overall we were satisfied, but only give 3 stars due to the following problems:We found the symbols for road numbers confusing - they don't use the standard symbol for interstate - so sometimes we had a list of possible road numbers without knowing which would be used on signposts. Another irritating feature is that the overlap between pages is very small, so that you find yourself flicking back between pages when you are on the edge. Finally, there are no large scale maps of any big cities. As a result we are going to have to buy a separate map of Oklahoma City, which is an additional expense we didn't expect."
2,good while it lasted,"I liked the product because of the wide mouth and would have given it 4 stars until today when it stopped working--about 18 months after purchase. However, I didn't save the warranty, so into the junk box it goes. I will give the cpt 35 a try and hope the company has fixed the problem. I really like the versatility of the long, extra wide slot."
2,Great Looking Piece Of Junk!,"This toaster looked great & worked fairly well when I bought it from Amazon. At least for the ""4 months"" it lasted, before it quit working entirely. I only used it about once every couple of weeks, so it was used about 15 times, before it quit. You take your chances with this toaster, as the price is good, but it will not last. Of the Quisinart line, this one was the LEMON of the crop. I'm an avionics tech, so I took it apart & I'm surprised that they would make this junk. I have a Quisinart Blender, cookware & utensils & they're great. They GOOFED on this one. Enough said!"
1,Very Disappointed,"With a name like Cuisinart it would seem to be of quality. It looked good, but upon using it we thought the time to toasting was overly extensive. It made breakfast impossible to serve all at one time. Also it didn't brown the bottom quarter of the toast. In spite of the cost we have replaced it."
1,JUNK--don't let the good name fool you!,"This toaster has been a total disappointment---it is very slow and it toasts lightly even on the highest setting. I typically have to have items go through two cycles of toasting to get the browning that I desire. Plus, only six months after buying it, the heating element broke on one side. I called Cuisinart and they were great about rushing me a new one--but I am in the market and researching for a new (and MUCH better) toaster!"
2,ok for bagels - lousy otherwise,"We've had ours for 3 years or so (gluttons for punishment). It does an ok job on bagels and other really thick things - but it's just plain lousy for normal toast. The heating elements tend to be very hot at the ends but cooler in the middle. This means that one end of the bread gets burned while the other is barely browned. The elements are also too far away from the center and don't move, so it takes at least two cycles to get toast for normal bread. Doesn't even color the bread on the first cycle. So - if you want a toaster dedicated to bagels, this one isn't bad - just don't expect to use it for anything else."
1,"It looks nice, but it's (no good)!","My husband and I brought one and the heating element broke on one side. We only had it for three months! I think Cuisinart needs to do more testing on this toaster. I know one thing, we won't buy another one."
2,"Great toaster, died too soon","As others have said, this one is not long-lived enough. It made good toast reliably and did bagels well, but a toaster should last more than two years."
1,Bad Luck or a Bad Toaster,"We bought a CPT-30 about 18 months ago. About one year ago, the handle (to push the toast down) broke off. Cuisinart was very good about sending us a brand new toaster under its three year warranty, but now, a year later one of the heating elements quit working. In fact, I was going through the Amazon.com site to find out what another new toaster might cost since I'm tired of dealing with this one. Besides being fragile, this toaster seemed fairly slow.UPDATE...Cuisinart was good enough to replace our toaster again after I wrote the above comments. Unfortunately, one of the heating elements broke last week, 14 months after the replacement."
5,Perfect on goat fence,"We bought this charger for our 18 acre goat ranch. We secured the perimeter with goat wire, then ran an electric wire need the bottom. All of the cross fencing is done with electric wire. Wow. No problems and we put it in three months ago. Putting up an electric fence is way easier and cheaper than a traditional goat wire fence.I would definitely purchase another one of these chargers for my newest land. We took it out of the box and let it charge a week in the sun. attached the wires, and, voila!, instant fence. The charge is really strong (as I know from personal experience-- ouch!) and our goat kids learned very quickly to avoid the fence."
5,parmak magnum 12 solar pak low imp. batt. op. 30mile electric fence charger,"So far we love this charger. We fence in hay fields for pasture in the Fall. The animals are always testing the electric fence. They tested it once and learned their lesson... It seems to hold a charge for a long time. We let it charge for a week in the sun then set it up. We had clouds and rain for a week straight after that,but the fencer still held a good charge."
2,parmak 12volt solar fence charger,"installed this on my farm to replace my old fence charger.it was not as advertised.when it was fully charged, as soon as one piece of grass or weed touched the fence, the power instantly dropped to nothing.parmak claims it can handle medium weeds or grass but this thing cant handle the job.i tried to use solar as an alternative to running up electric bill.to me its just worth paying a little more each month on my electric bill than dealing with this weak product."
5,Wonderful Music,The whole family is enjoying these CDs and keep telling me how glad they are I purchased them.
1,strauss flubs,This was my fault for expecting something great for this price--songs are abbreviated and not worth wasting time listening to.Only good thing is the price was not much-should have known
5,Tradition and Innovation Gets Five Star,"Alizadeh is Iran's finest living instrumentalist. But in this work you find out what a great composer he is as well. The work is based heavily on the dastgah system of Persian classical music, but the innovations are stunning."
5,Mules Across the Great Wide Open - Reviewed by Shea,I thought it was an outstanding book. I could not put it down till I was finished. Makes me want to pack with mules in the outback. What a Gal and her Sister too. Way-to-go Jody. Just wonderful. Thanks
2,Overrated,"This book makes the fourth one in the series that I have read. And the series continues to decline. I was hoping that the Brown Sugar books would get better along the way, but this is not the case.Although, Secret Desires is well written, I didn't find enough of the stories to be highly erotic and entertaining. If more stories that hold the readers attention would become a part of the Brown Sugar series, then it would make for a more pleasurable reading."
3,Could Be Better,"The album would have been better if they did it like Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert. They should have gotten artists like Joan Baez, Carlos Santana, Tracy Chapman, and others. It should have been half new artists and half old artists. That would have been a better tribute album, showing how the Beatles influenced old and new artists alike.However, there are worthy tracks on the album, like Ben Lee's version of In My Life is better than the original. Dar Williams does a great version of You Won't See Me. Ben Kweller, Nellie Kay and Rhett Miller also do good covers. The rest are just okay."
2,"A few cool tracks (Furnaces, McKay, Sufjan and others reviewers have cited) but mostly this record just proves the old adage...","... if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And ""Rubber Soul"" sure as hell ain't broke."
5,Fine Shredding Disk Excellent for Latkes,This is the second time we have ordered this disk. We use ours all the time for making latkes. This disk was ordered for my mother-in-law.
4,Good stuff,Great option between corse shredding disc and fine grating disc. Typical high Cuisinart quality.
5,Great fine shredder,"It actually is too fine for a lot of applications. It is a high quality blade. If you want very finely shredded veggies, this is the blade for you. It is actuaslly too fine for normal ""salad"" applications, but good at what it does."
1,Terrible book for any program except RHIA,"I chose this book because I thought the AHIMA would endorse a good book for a Health Information Foundations class. I was wrong. This book is written so far above and beyond any beginning class, I am amazed it is actually endorsed for anything but a BA degree. The concepts in this book are so advanced that my students are just dying out. Plus, there is barely any supporting information related to the concepts, principles and regulations that they introduce. I would not recommend this book for anything less than an RHIA program. I am deeply disappointed by this book."
1,"Unreliable, Poorly Designed Product","QuikLok BX718 Deluxe Padded Keyboard Bench - LargeI brought the BX-18 model, which is supposed to hold up to 300lbs. I don't weigh nearly that amount. I weigh under the max. weight appropriate for the BX-14 as well. Anyway, I used the BX-18 for 4hrs and found myself crashing to the floor. It broke that easily. The retailer (which was not Amazon) said they have not had many problems with this bench, but I am skeptical although they are shipping me a new one. Problem is the study medal pins that mainstain the selected height sit in a plastic cylinder. The plastic cylinder gave way and the pin is now embedded in a slanted position in the defective plastic piece. They advertise about the heavy duty metal but your weight is supported by heavy duty plastic. Why isn't the pin sitting in a metal piece instead of plastic?"
5,Excellent reading for those who're interested in Tibetan,"I have learnt Tibetan for about two months in India, I found this book extremely helpful for Tibetan students too. The text, though simple, are written with Tibetan script, transiliteration and English translation, the story is good too. I found it quite touching that finally His Holiness (in the comics) said, ""Tibet is in your heart"".Yes, Tibet is in my heart, I'm going back there one day."
1,Save yourself the hassle,"Very disappointing. We were convinced by the positive reviews from others so we went ahead after much research and ordered this espresso machine. it arrived, didn't work (electronics problem) and the friendly Saeco customer service person told us to simply return it. This is our second attempt with a Saeco product and we have now given up on this brand. The first try was with a factory refurbished machine which never worked despite the fact that we went the extra mile and sent it back to the Saeco factory only to have it returned in the same inoperable condition. The Saeco 21103 Royal Professional was our second attempt, this time we got a totally new machine. The result was the same: a machine that didn't even begin to work.Thank heaven for Amazon and its splendid return policy. Save yourself the hassle and pass on this one."
2,Lots of Trouble,"Returned first machine; wouldn't work. Received replacement from Amazon. Same problem. Was instructed by SAECO to return machine to them for replacement. Received 3rd machine on Oct 13. On Oct 24 machine stopped working. Apparently the heating element went out. Machine has been returned to SAECO for repair or replacement. If problem occurs again, will retun the machine to Amazon for refund.In all fairness, this machine is a good product and makes great coffee when it is working properly. We had an earlier edition which we gave to our daughter when we decided to purchase the new one. Our other daughter also has a SAECO and it works well. So perhaps we have just had bad luck. But right now we wish we would have just hung on to the old one and saved $1500."
5,Saeco Royal Professional,"I've had one of these for a couple of years and use it 4 or 5 times a day. Generally it's excellent, though I have a few little complaints. Mine doesn't seem to handle pre-ground coffee too well, though I have to confess I've only tried that a couple of times. And it requires a fair amount of attention: adding water, emptying grounds, adding beans, occasionally cleaning the brew unit. And it's complicated--I have to get out the manual every time I want to descale it. But apart from those minor irritations, which may be more problems with the consumer than with the unit, we have been very happy with it, and feel lucky to have it. Makes great coffee."
2,Gray paper provides poor contrast,"I like 5 per inch grid paper over 4 per inch because it fits my writing and sketching style better, but they're expensive and harder to find in bulk. I thought this would be a great deal to get 12 pads at once. Unfortunately the light gray color of the paper and darker gray lines make for an awful contrast, and it's difficult to easily read my own notes and diagrams in the fluorescent glare of the office lights."
5,Usual suspects and more add up to a great line up,"Poor Agatha Raisin. She is not nice in the conventional sense and she has none of the homemaking qualities one associates with good village women. And yet there is something about her insecurities, her imperfect pitch in the hum of relationships, and her dazzling self-involvement (coupled with almost no self-awareness) that makes her a wonderful protagonist in the perfect-picture setting of these novels.M.C. Beaton again develops a believable and funny cast of characters, some of whom are quite disposable, and sets in motion a plot with more twists than your average village ramble. It may be the best book yet in this enjoyable series, with the finger of accusation pointing at... well, it would not do to tell. My only complaint is that Agatha Raisin is always ""high carb"" reading; the book ends while I am still craving more, more..."
4,Agatha Raisin is back on form,"This outing finds Agatha once again battling depression. She doesn't like getting old. She sometimes finds her retirement boring. And, she just never seems to find the right man to spend her time with.The pretty boy new curate is murdered very early in the book, and Agatha spends the remaining chapters trying to clear the name of her good friend Mrs. Bloxby's husband. Everyone in Carsely thinks the Vicar done it, because the curate was more popular.Once again, Agatha is sleuthing with her neighbor, the mystery writer, and once again the two of them are constantly sending each other missed signals.Agatha may never find romantic happiness, but she's a good friend, and a terrific fundraiser. If she ever learns to recognize contentedness, it may be the end of her detecting. Lucky for us, she remains obtuse."
4,Agatha Raisin...the game is a foot!,"Agatha is in the middle of the mysteries and trying to solve them as a professional while trying to figure out her love life and her relationship to other people She is getting older and their are some concerns she will be alone for ever, but she doesn't give up even through she is on a bumpy road. I like this mystery and think it is better than some of the earlier ones. More depth and characters to grow the plot with....fund to read and especially with my Kindle."
2,I see no change,My dermatologist sold this to me. I have a brown spot just behind my left eye. I have tried everything to get it removed. My dermatologist even spayed it with cryofreeze. It pealed in the middle but left an outline on the outside and it looks like it is coming back. I wish this would work -but so far Not !
2,Perhaps I should be more patient???,This stuff didn't do any changes for me and I used it for 3-4 weeks. I have discovered using hydroquinone and kojic acid products in jars is ineffective because of the air contamination. Others say it works though? If you got some freckles you want to lose..it didn't for me. Atleast not fast enough .
3,expensive,Product is too expensive for what it can do. i am not impressed. did not see any results and it is very small.
2,too pricy,I can't really tell whether this product works or not because I only used it for a week and my breakout got worse but one thing I do know is it's way too freaking expensive.
2,Clinicians Complex 6,"Well I was hoping this would work on a scar I have. But sadly it didn't lighten it at all. After about 3 weeks of using it, it just irritated my skin by making it red and itchy."
3,Label is deceiving but the product still works,"The label falsely suggest 6% hydroquinone. When the product actually contains 2% hydroquinone, 2% kojic acid, and 2% bearberry extract. I felt like I was tricked into buying the product (this is why I took off two stars). I was going to return it once I received it, but i decided to give it a little try.The product works. I've been prescribed 4% hydroquinone before and this product actually works a bit faster and is gentler on my skin. In combination with tretinoin (a retinoic acid for acne treatment) I've seen major improvement within 3 days and I only used the product at night.Also, I'm a dark skinned african american with eczema. I only say this because I read reviews and I wish people would put their skin type and color. Lots of things just don't work for darker skin tones or eczema and acne prone skin."
5,"Great Product, but....","This product works very well. I am using it on the top of my hands, and it is fading my dark spots. I have a few on my face, becareful, dab this product on the spots only. I was spreading it all over my face and got blisters, so beware. Nice to have a product do, what it says it will do. A little pricey but I need the 6 percent."
2,Works but if you stop spots will get darker,"So I have black spots between my thighs and in my belly button line, I have always suffered from this. Before I tried using this cream vitamin e was helping diminish the spots but I then decided to use this bleaching cream. Although after the first time trying it, the cream did clear up the spots significantly, I kept trying it for two weeks and the darkness stayed the same. I decided to stop to see what would happen and my dark spots got darker then before!!! Please be aware before using this, I do have very sensitive skin but I am not sure why it got darker then before I started using the crean. Also now I have tried putting vitamin e and now that doesn't work either!! again yeah it might clear the spots out but if you stop be aware your dark spots will be more evident then ever before!! at least in my case!"
1,waste of time & money,"(Purchased 2 bottles, one for my sister & one for myself) I Used this product on a blemish i have on my shoulder & on my right temple. Used it for two weeks, twice a day. Then i used it once a day for the following weeks, it did not notice a change on my blemish. Very disappointed. My sister has brown markings around her armpits. She also used this product twice a day for weeks, there was no change on her brown marks. .......again, very disappointing. I will not use or recommend this product, waste of time & money."
3,Didn't have the energy of some of the other Cd's,I really enjoyed The E Ala E and The Man and his music CD's. This one just didn't have the same spark I guess.
4,Sweet Sounds From a Gentle Giant,Izzy has a voice like no other. Kind of makes you wonder what songs he would be singing if he was still alive today.
3,Not as funny as all my other Ken Davis videos & DVD's,"I've seen Ken live and loved it, but this was just not his best work. It really suprised me, it seem slow moving. Ken did look great since he has lost some weight and we did laugh some, just not as great as all the others."
3,Mediocre Jazzy X-mas,"This is one of those bargain bin jazz cds that I have aquired over the years, mostly as gifts from people. This album is relatively short, clocking in at 32 minutes, and most of the songs (if not all) fade out at the end, which is one of the downfalls of this album. The instrumentation consists of a small combo group of trumpet, sax, drums, bass, and keyboards. The musicians (which are not listed anywhere!) sound like amateurs, and there are some missed notes and flubbed entrances here and there. I would have given the cd 2.5 stars, but you can't do that on this site. It is an ok CD, and if you get it as a gift, this is a CD I wouldn't feel too bad about trading in or selling after a few years. At least it's almost worth the one or two dollars they probably charged for it."
2,On the Disappointing Side,"As a Numero Uno Jerry Goldsmith fanatic, I was substantially disappointed with this versatile composer's effort for the film CRIMINAL LAW. While he went on to enjoy greater successes with similarly-themed films, such as BASIC INSTINCT, this is one score that sounds like Goldsmith wrote it in his sleep--while in the clutches of a deep fever. Entirely synthesized, the score has no underpinning humanity, save for a few fleeting piano motifs which are far between. Goldsmith also borrows from himself here--there are motifs straight out of LEVIATHAN, a film released in the same year as CRIMINAL LAW, which the composer doesn't even try to cover up. The bottom line: this is a poorly integrated score which doesn't stand by itself at all. Given the capabilities of the artist, it's a disappointment."
5,ONE HOT READ!,I must say this book was great. A very good mix of romance and suspense. I would recommend this book to anybody!
4,Good Book,I liked this book. The suspense was very good. The BDSM elements were light and the sex scenes were hot. This Book actually had a plot and I hope to see more of this type of book from Jaid Black.
4,Admittingly this is no Empress...BUT,"I admit this book isn't as sizzling and alpha satisfying as her previous books. BUT...it's good. The suspense is pretty good. She tosses in some twists that I didn't see coming at times.Although, the heroine was disappointing at times. When a woman is almost killed by an attacker, one would think she would carry some sort of weapon/spray after such an event. Heck, install an alarm system in your apartment, anything!Besides, that, it was decent. If you enjoy sizzling scenes, hot enough to roast a rooster than this isn't for you. But if your the type, who isn't ready to fully dive into this time of genre. Then this book will warm you up to it.So I give it a 4. Partly because of the twists and the other half is that I think it's a nice introduction for readers who are new to the genre. Like I said, the book is no Empress..."
2,i wasn't offended but ....,"The sex didn't offend me but the writing did. To be fair I didn't finish the book. I put it down and just couldn't pick it up again. My score was plot sex 5 of 5, plot 2 of 5, style 1 of 5. If you want steam go for it. If you want story and style forget it."
5,99 steps of Suspense,This book was amazing.I was going to read this book but my friend told me it was boring. NOT. I like this book takes you all over Paris. And makes you jump in your seat. I :-) this book. I have another favorite Nancy Drew book so I rated this 4 stars. Be awaiting for Suspense!
3,Geography and Mystery combined.,"A great but complicated yarn. Details of Paris and surrounding area seem to be drawn from a map rather than an actual visit. Also, they are over-emphasised which detracts from the story-line. As always the ending comes too fast."
2,Did not work for me,I tried this based on what I read on the internet. For me it was a waste of time and money. Did not give me energy and I saw no change.
1,Cuisinart Lemon!,"This is a poor excuse for a toaster! Toasts bread unevenly due to poor workmanship. Burns white bread if set higher than 2. The touted ""electronic"" control has no way to sense the actual amount of doneness as older toasters do. Must have two slices at a time to prevent burning. Looks very nice but does not live up to the high price and Cuisinart name. I will go back to my [inexpensive] toaster that failed after four years of good service. The last time I will buy on the basis of the Cuisinart name!"
1,The worst toaster ever,"Terrible product. On the exact same setting, and exact same bread, one will be burnt and the next will be under done. Then if you want to toast it more it won't stay down. Nothing on this toaster works correctly. Plain and simple...a piece of junk. You're better off buying a 15 dollar K-mart special."
3,Ouch,I bought this toaster for my mother and it looks great and works great but the cord for the plug comes out of the front of the toaster and hangs over it when plugged it. Burnt my fingers on it twice.
2,Looks nice... uneven toaster,"This is a stylish toaster. Have you tried finding a decent toaster lately? I've been through many. If you like crispy dark toast, this is it - but if you like browned toast, this is uneven and burns one end, and light on the other. This is the second one of these I had. The first was bad and so the customer service (which is very good) sent me a replacement. It's just as bad. Used to be any cheapo toaster would do a great job. It's much harder to find one now. If you look inside when the elements are going, many of the windings of the heating elements are too tight and so don't heat up since they are flush against the insulation so only around 1/2 of the inner elements even glow red, but the outer ones are better, so it's very uneven. Good luck!"
1,Flimsy crap not worthy of Cuisinart brand,"Mine died after 6 months - half the heating elements stopped working, toasting only one side of the bread. Took it apart - no loose or broken wires, so must have been the circuitry. Chucked it in the garbage.While it was working, it would jam easily. The push-down handle has a flimsy metal tang that twists easily (when kids or oafish adults use it). The tang then rubs against the slot, incinerating the toast."
1,At least it only burned half of my toast,"I hate it when I spend more to get more, only to be disappointed. This toaster looks great, but the timer is totally off. Sometimes a setting of 3 will take 15 seconds, sometimes 22. The browning is uneven. It looks nice next to my other chrome Cuisinart products, but I can't say anything nice about its performance."
1,Not durable and toasts unevenly. Don't be fooled.,Waste of your money. The classic style is a cheap imitation of better quality toasters made 50 years ago. Failed after 1 year. Can't be repaired.
2,Can't toast WonderBread!,"I bought this toaster based on the rave reviews it seems to receive but what a disappointment. The control on this machine does not have enough range to be able to toast a slice of white bread properly, it burns it everytime. Giving it the benefit of a second chance, I exchanged it for another unit. The second unit behaved exactly as the first. The instruction manual says that the control should be set to 3 as an initial setting, the range is 1 - 6. It consistantly burns white bread toast on 1. I didn't try it on 3, it would probably light the bread on fire. I'm returning this thing and getting a different brand. The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is for it's great classic looks."
1,Don't buy this one,Got this for Christmas. It lasted 3 months. Now it does exactly nothing. I dug out the old one (a GE that I got as a wedding present in 1964) and am now using it.
2,Came highly recommended but a huge let down,"As most everybody else has stated you can not get an evenly toasted piece of bread out of this toaster. One side dark, the other side barely warm. This toaster is very inconsistent in the way it toasts. It's almost like the roll of the dice as to what your toast will turn out like next. I would return this toaster but it was a gift and I don't want to hurt any feelings."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE TOASTER,This Cuisinart toaster worked fairly well -- for about 3 months. Then the handle that holds the toast down no longer engages and it's trash! Total waste of $50. Will never buy another Cuisinart product. Don't waste your money on this one!
5,Love It!,"After having gone through toaster after toaster, I finally found one that that not only looks like a real toaster, but actually works. Every slice of bread comes out perfectly browned. I highly recommend it."
1,Disappointed,"Bought this to replace worn out identical toaster. Only toast on one side of each slice of bread. Seller, ezra504, refuses to respond to my queries to return the toaster. I am very disapponted"
1,"Junk, pure and simple","It's guaranteed for 3 years whichis great. But mine broke after one year. I used it about once a week for bagels. The popper no longer pops up the toast. You have to pay for shipping and handling to get it fixed. No way! Either buy a really good one from Waring or Williams Sonoma or like the earlier post, buy a K-mart special. More wast for our landfills, tsk tsk."
2,Not a very good idea,"If toasting more than Wonder bread is your hope, don't buy this thing. As a matter of fact stay away from Cuisinart altogether. My wife replaced our old Cuisinart, if two-years is old, with a new Cuisinart. We threw the last one out when it started making toxic odors akin to melting plastic, and it became difficult toasting bread when the lever lowering the toast wouldn't stay down. The latest one will be returned shortly, unused, because we do not know of bread made so small that may fit in this toaster. The mouth may be wide, but it is terribly short. You can basically toast only one piece at a time because you would have to cut your bread in half to get it in the toaster."
1,Died young,"Don't buy this toaster for its looks. Mine died young, approx. 1 year old it wouldn't work anymore. Worked ok for a while, but now, I have to buy a different one. I will not buy Cuisinart brand."
1,Very disappointed,"The browning dial has 6 settings on it. I can't imagine why, since my toast is almost burnt when it's set to 2. Perhaps it's not calibrated correctly. This toaster couldn't handle frozen waffles set at 1 and the defrost button on; it toasted them way too dark for my daughter's liking."
1,Toasts likes it looks - cool,"We replaced a 700 yr-old toaster finally and chose Cuisinart for the name and looks. Such superficiality has its inevitable rewards. This machine cannot accomplish the basic function of turing bread brown with any consistency. The first slice is too dark, the second too light. The hilarious rocket launch pop-up feature gets old after three times or so. Start your English muffin before you get the eggs out of the frig in order to eat them together. We are now debating how much longer we have to use this alleged toaster until we can justify a new (different) one."
3,"Looks- ten, toast-five","I love the look of this toaster, but I find the toasting ability to be uneven, albeit fast. It browns a lot in one area, and white in the rest. I have it set at ""1"" out of ""6"" on the toast setting dial, any higher is way too browned, or burnt. Perhaps it will lose some of it's vigilance with age? I don't hate the toaster, but I don't love it as much as I thought I would. I Recommend it, with reservations."
1,not RCA universal,Does not do what I bought it for on an RCA tv. Doesn't even dowhat a radio shack universal remote does. Cost would exceed returning it.
3,Divers Vs Marine Biologists,Not good for diver identification!Poor pictures too much information and not enough pictures.Good book for a Marine Biologist loads of information.
4,A window into today's faithful?,"Written with a 'hands on' approach, Spiritual Marketplace takes the reader on a exploration of what drives America's faith. The classic Catholic & Protestant models no longer seem to be working the way the used to. And yet Americans continue to identify with some sort of faith. The latest trend of describing oneself as 'spiritual not religious' is reflected in a market which prusues and explores alternatives to traditions that no longer seem to fit today's lifestyle. Roof offers great insights. The book keeps the reader engrossed and curious. Definitely worth the investment."
4,Helping Close the Gap in Research,"Roof's book is a welcomed insight into the nature and character of the up-and-coming generation. It solidly answers the question, ""What motivates, and what are the thoughts of this next generation"". Roof makes a solid claim (well supported) that this next generation is moving away from religion and embracing spirituality. While I personally think they are moving away from DOGMA, the point may in the end be the same. Religion is too slow to adjust to the relevant and contextual problems faced by this modern generation. Roof, provides some insights into where this generation is headed.Ewest, TimVisiting Research Collaborator,Princeton University Faith and Work"
2,Interesting idea - poor execution,"Romero's dead films are my favorite horror. With that inoond I was open to seeing something new and thought that animating one of the greatest horror films of all time might be an interesting adventure. Unfortunately the treatment did not love up to the expectations of this reviewer. The reason - too many art styles. If they had stuck to one or two art styles this might have been pulled off. However, they decided to go with way to many and the whole thing just became muddied.Even some of the art styles were dull and uninspired.This might be a good rent, but I would not recommend a purchase on this one."
1,Awful,"Had they stuck to one or two, or even five or six animation styles this could have been great. Or even broken the styles down by chapter like Animatrix did. Instead this is an epileptic mess of poor animation, bottom barrel talent most of the time with only a few entertaining exceptions. Considering that the movie itself is public domain, I feel ripped off for what I paid for this jumbled mess. Sometimes indie does not mean good."
2,Bridget's Review,My dad and I are huge fans of the Night of the Living Dead movies. I got this because I thought it would be a great flick for one of our father/daughter movie nights. I wouldn't say that this version is one of my favorites. It's definitely new and different but I couldn't really get into it.
1,badly done storyboard,I rented the video thinking it'd be different and good. Wheat I got was a crappy STORYBOARD with crap for 'animation'.
1,Not worth it.,The animation is horrid looks like they got a buch of 3rd graders to draw and animate it. Best watch the original and shoot this one in the head it's complete crap.
1,What a disappointment!,"I would give this zero stars if I could, this project is awful.The concept is exciting and I was expecting something more along the lines of ""Waking Life,"" but the execution is just awful. The level of so-called ""animation"" is atrocious; This looks like a classroom of junior high students had one day to animate the entire movie, and half of them quit. Based on the concept and the reviews, I gave it a shot and boy do I regret it.My friends and I watched this as part of a horror movie marathon and it was the only movie we could not finish because it was totally unwatchable. We put in the Savini remake instead.It's also super low resolution, so unless you're watching on a phone it looks like crap."
1,Part of the Bargain,"This story was a GREAT disappointment. The story line was weak and the SEX was gratuitous! If Libby's nipples ""perked up"" one more time, I was going to throw up! A thread of the story would be lost and then the author would [almost]write ""opps"" and tie up the thread; example: Aaron shows up all of a sudden and leaves, just as suddenly! I had to check the copyright date on this book to see what happened to Ms. Miller, who is usually a favorite of mine. Copyright was 1985 so I am happy to report that she has definitely improved from 15 years ago. But, the experience taught me not to buy ""everything"" by an author...... The bad news is the book is just plain awful.......the good news is Ms. Miller writes very well these days.......love scenes are tasteful and balanced with the story and her stories are strong. Whew! I feel better getting this off my chest........ AVOID BUYING THIS PARTICULAR BOOK; WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!"
2,Old fashion Harlequin Romance,`Part of Bargain' is Harlequin Romance with a cute story and lots of love scenes. It was a quick read but I not sure I would buy this book - not worth your hard earned money. If you are looking for fun romance with a story I would suggest Kate Angell ` Crazy for you' - instead.
1,disappointed,"i am a huge Linda Lael Miller fan. Her stories are involve well developed characters, and scenes. I was disappointed. If the two characters were not fighting they were having thinking about each other naked. The story was weak and the characters even weaker. I did buy the chemistry or the love hate relationship. Teh only positive was I got teh book from teh library and I di not have t pay for it, unfortunately someone else did.since the release of this bok her stories have dramatically improved. I have enjoyed both McKettricks and Creeds."
2,OK saw,"I'd purchased this one a few years ago at Home Depot. I'd noticed it had only a 30 day warranty so was too late when I got around using it.First, the grease seal broke for the sliding table even before I had used it. I keep lubing the thing but the grease keep oozing out such that it required more force to push the sliding table.Second, diamond blade wasn't very good and had to replace with a better one.Third, water pump wasn't good either. Replace that with a stronger pump as well.Fourth, keeping it in storage for a few months between uses, the belt had developed a memory and kept rubbing/pounding into the plastic cover guard with every rotation. Loud and annoying, will replace it with a V-belt later.Fifth, motor seems to have enough power for the 10"" blade but binds when cutting tile due to belt slippage. Will replace with V-belt as stated above.Had done a lot of projects with this, nice to have a 10"" wet saw but will go with better quality next time around."
4,Great performance; weak recording production,"The concert performance is great, and the music is great as well. I'd recommend the album to anyone. I should warn that there is a very unnatural sounding echo across the entire recording, which at loud volumes is very noticable and can get pretty annoying. Maybe some people don't notice it, but I sure do--Every note happens twice. Moreover, it seems like a studio-added, digital echo; making me think that the remastering may have been done in bad taste. If anyone has any ideas of how to get a copy of a clean recording of this concert, please post them here!! Technical gripes aside, Shajarian totally rocks, and this concert is amazing.--------(I later found out from the producer of this CD that the echo is a tape delay effect turned on on the 2 track tape recorder used to record this concert. Apparently such effects were in vogue at the time. There's no existing recording of this concert without the echo.)"
4,Worth the money,"This is a very good book with details to help you actually build a guitar. Outside of the cover, the book is void of colored pictures which would really add to the experience. Most of us never get the chance to see these instruments. Nevertheless, I do recommend this book."
5,Making Master Guitars,"Really nice, I found a soft copy of this and liked it so much I just had to acquire the book which I thoroughly enjoy!"
5,WOW. Excellent book in a new trilogy,"I just finished reading Time of the Twins for the first time, and I am honestly impressed by the story. It is very dark, but there is plenty of plot twists, character development and complex situations to satisfy any true fantasy lover. Raistlin is truly an amazing character, he shines in every page. I highly reccommend this book, and I'm looking forward to reading the next!"
4,Time of the Twins and a twist in the future,"Well this was a very interestig read. Having finished the Chronicles Trilogy this book Time of the Twins drops you into some back history of two or even three of your favorite characters: Cameron, Raistland, and that stealing future changing kender, Tas!Very interesting and worth the time and money...well though out."
5,A Great Book!,This book was great! It is a great look into Raistlin. If you were a fan of him in the Chronicles series then you must read this series. It was very well written. Anyone that likes dragonlance needs to read this book!
4,Time of the Twins,Time of the Twins is an ok book. It seemed to me like it could have ended a little better. Time of the Twins is a very hard book to read without reading the Chronicles trilogy first. I also read The Soulforge and the background from that book made this book that much better. I feel the conflict was introduced a little too bluntly but the development was writen well. All in all i enjoyed reading Time of the Twins. The next bookes in the set are GREAT. Therefor I recomend reading this book.
4,the first DragonLance book I ever read,"I originally read this book 5 years ago to impress some dumb guy who was way too into Dragonlance. I actually, as opposed to the many others who reviewed it, like it better than Chronicles. But for some reason it, and the other two in the Legends series depress the hell out of me. And no one can ever get enough of Raistlin, or Tasslehoff."
3,"In comparison to the origianal DragonLance, it isn't much.","I found this book, at best, mediocre! I think Weis and Hickman could definately have done better. The beginnin was the better part, since it included most of the Heroes but afterwards, it breaks to the Twins and Tasslehof (Who was the only reason I continued to read). The book shows a great transformation in both the twins and Crysiania as they go back through time right before the Cataclysm. Unlike the DragonLance first books, these were nothing spectacular"
5,Just Finished,Loved it. I can't wait to read the next one. Test of Twins and War of Twins thank you for the book.
4,This novel is a must read!,"Raistlin ""destroys"" Caramon through his mind so that he may be free of him and then turns his attention towards an impossible goal- to take Takhisis's place as the supreme evil. Crysania, a cleric, believes that Paladine has called her to stop Raistlin and his insane quest. Raistlin kills her but the mages send her back in time to an age where clerics and/or magees were powerful enough to bring her back to life- pre catyclysm. there, Caramon, Tasselhof Burfoot, and Crysania do all that they can to stop Raistlin in his crazy quest."
3,"Good book, keeps you interested, ending is very suspensful!","In this book, you find Crysania, a cleric of Paladine, who seeks to turn the archmage Raistlin from his evil ways. Raistlin has a plan to travel back in time to the time before the Cataclysm, and learn there from Fistandantilus, and finally make his studies of magic complete. Tas, Caramon, and Crysania must go back in tijme and try to stop his evil plans. Please e-mail me with questions!"
2,"An imaginative world, but not a very good book","I have read my way through the legends triology, mostly because I sometimes play an internet roleplaying game which is partly staged in the world of Krynn, and I wanted to know more about the background of this fantasy world. I found it very hard to tolerate the poor language and grammar of the authors, the stereotypic, sentimental and one dimensional characters, and the authors' poor grasp of detail. To offer an example, Tanis Half-Elven (A very annoying character) is described as having a beard which bears testimony to his human blood, since no elf on Krynn can grow a beard. None the less, when the also very annoying character Chrysania is visited by an elven cleric, this elf is sporting a very long beard, which I then assume must have been false.When I still decided to give this book two stars, it is because I find the world of Krynn innovative, and I can't help liking kenders. To bad that the prose isn't good enough to bring this new world to life."
5,Rastlin is the ultimate mage.!!!!,"Once I picked this book up I could not set it down. The Chronicles Trilogy left me screaming to see Rastilin obtain the power he was looking for. Test of the twins gave me more insight on the twins past in the wizards tower and left me hanging with Rastilin, Caraman, and Crysainia disapearing in the end. Guess I gotta read War of the twins next. I love it."
5,"Once you start reading it, you can't stop","This is from someone who attacks fantasy books like they're chocolate. Due to my library's somewhat gaps in the Dragonlance series, I'm working my way through it in somewhat of a twisted manner. Spring Dawning was the first I read, and then Autumn Twilight. However, Time of the Twins was my favorite. From where Caramon faints dead away as a drunk who his friends don't recognize at Tanis' feet, to where Tas transfroms himself as a mouse in the Tower of Sorcery in order to follow Caramon back in time (something, in no circumstances are kender supposed to do) to the time Caramon is sold as a gladiator in Istar and Tas triumphantly tells Raistlin he's going to stop the Cataclysm, to the growing affection between Raistlin and a beautiful cleric of Paladine, I could not put it down. It may not have the battles of the Chronicles, but the many quirky turns and creative twists are for anyone who likes the kender, the twins, a splash of insight, and a fantastic read."
5,More than just boox..,When I first read these novels I was about 16 years old and some sort of spell came over me. If you are an AD&D player or DM this is really a must. Since '92 I have read these books more than 15 times and I will read them again as soon as I have time this summer. They're magic.
4,quite the awsome book!,Second best dragoon lance book i have ever read. (dragons of winter night being the best) raistlin is by far the coolest character ever. what is the next book in chronilodgical order after test of the twins?arturo
5,Learn and learn and learn,"I have read Asterix since i was 5 and now at 28 years old, i still read it and never cease to discover new things in it.For kids, asterix represents a very human heroe, with his limitations, idiosyncrasies and great deeds. But as one grows up and learns about history and modern culture, one begins to understand the subtle the historical references. A lot of Asterix is based on true history and gave me the impetus to want to learn more about the Roman world.In a nutshell, great for kids, great for adults."
4,So far so good,The best feature is the ability of the answering machine to call another number(such as your cell) when a message is left. Also the display is nice and bright. So far I am happy with the purchase althuogh I've only had the product for about 3 weeks.
2,a sort of good effort,"This is a great story for all of the people out there who like bad books. It is about Jack. Jack is a 16 year old with the typical family issues. His parents are dvorced, his mom is dating a constructin worker who does yoga, he is shy around girls and his dad is gay. You know, typical teenage stuff.He has to cope with his father being a homosexual, and with the constant teasing at school. He thinks that his best friend's family is normal, but it is not because the father beats the mother. This book just doesnt come together at the end. It just drops everything like there was a set number of words and a hurried due date. i dont recommend it really."
3,Jack,"A.M. Homes' short story collection 'The Safety of Objects' made me a huge fan of her work. 'Jack' is a decent book, but could do with a bit of the brutal whimsy I've come to expect fom her work. While the plot might seem too pat to adults and the characters too noble, 'Jack' would be an excellent book for a young, straight teen to read when he is grappling with having a gay parent- Jack is a superb role model."
3,Early Days - At least a three but much learning to be completed,"This software arrived promptly, it is definitely an improvement on the previous PUNCH software. It is easier to square rooms and make walls etc exact distances. It does take patience and determination to fully learn how to use it, I am about 50% of the way there after a month. The video demonstrations are very good I would ask for the number of these to be increased to cover all the common tricky tasks. One or two 3D errors that I am working out how to correct and may be my lack of knowledge rather then the package. Will report back in a number of months."
3,They still have work to do,"I found this product did not meet my expectations. Most of the problem was in defining slab flooring and short cement foundation walls . I submitted many problems via email to the tech group however they were sluggish most of the time with a reply back. On the more difficult questions they just did not reply at all. Maybe there strength was in landscaping, but that was not why I bought the software. Having said that, it was fairly easy to learn and did about 90% of what I wanted it to do with a little work on my part. However, there is not much out there for the low cost of this software. Guess it's better than nothing. I also had troubles getting a printer like Staples or Kinko to handle the output print files so I could print to 1/4"" scale to obtain a building permit. There were no allowances for trusses instead of stick building roof support in the materials list. Also several other little problems that they have work arounds for but added to the difficulty."
2,Home design software,"This product is great if you are only interested in 3-D modeling. It is NOT recommended by me for serious home design. There is no provision for setting exact dimensions in the planning mode and they resist being set with a mouse. Without a provision for entering precise measurments even the length of a wall cannot be set with any degree of accuracy. Without accuracy the software is just a large, memory grabbing, disk hogging, toy. All the fancy product and finish tie-ins in the world cannot overcome this deficiency. I am profifient with a CAD program and this software can't touch it for producing buildable plans."
2,"Parts are too complex, others are too limited","After using this product for basic stuff [floor plans], I found that the 3D functionality to be far too complex and not really accurate. To create roof, ceiling and floors to create a realistic version of your floor plan, the process seemed too cumbersome and the elevations never quite seemed to be right. The pictures they show you are obviously done by the ""professionals"" on this software and mine never turn out quite realistic.I also have found that the gallery of objext to be very limited and a little confusing. Why there are twenty different towel bars and candles I do not know. Plus, there aren't many 2D images to place in floor plans.If you are a hobbyist, this program might suit your needs, but if you are using this for a function, don't bother."
2,Vista = Punch Software.. Stay Away,I have experienced Non Compatiblity w/Vista & Poor Support from Punch with respect to email response and problem solving for their product.
3,Good for Fun,"This is a fun program to play around with, and can be used for getting ideas for smaller projects. I wouldn't recommend using this program if you are trying to get real architectural detail however- it is really hard to learn all the functions in the program, especially the topography mapping. The instruction book is really simplified, and there are no other resources that I've found to help with my more technical questions.Bottom line: entertaining, but if you plan on doing fully detailed work, look elsewhere."
1,Not Windows Vista Compatible,"I love this product. I am living in a house I designed with it. I also use it to plot survey coordinates at work. So why one star? My XP computer died and the program will not load on Vista. I think it is because of the program load being based on Adobe Acrobat 5, which Vista cannot recognize. I would need a patch to install before I load it. Punch site says it's Vista compatible. Not."
5,Amazing and easy to use,"I bought this product because I had tried with great success another Punch product. It was so easy to use and load onto my computer. It was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls, to my deck and plants outside."
1,Horrible Smell - Ruins Milk,"Beware of this product! These bags will ruin your precious milk. These bags have a TERRIBLE smell (smell a new one if you don't believe me), which makes your milk smell HORRIBLE when defrosted. I discovered this only after storing 100+ bags. Other bags on the market do not have this terrible smell. In my opinion these bags should not be sold."
2,Not a big fan!!,I bought these to go with my Medela pump. I have only had 1 leak in the freezer. I didn't know it was a problem until today. I take my kid to the babysitter and she calls and said the amount written on them is not at all even close to what's in the bag. When it says 5 oz there is more like 1.5 oz in the bag. Very frustrating!! Have never tried another bag but will now.
1,These bags are terrible.,"I only bought these because I couldn't find the Lansinoh ones (should have just gone online).1. no double zipper.2. the zipper is really hard to zip3. they don't hold enough milk- the Lansinoh ones hold much more. My DD's bottles are 7 oz so with these I have to use two bags (along with the extra effort).I have not found any bags that reflect accurate measuring. I don't bother pumping into them as I'll never know how much milk is in there. No matter the brand, I always pump into a hard bottle then pour into the bag.Get the Lansinoh ones!"
1,Horrible horrible. Stay Away,"Very expensive, hard to pour into, and they do not stand up very well. The lansinoh bags are so much better and easier to use. Plus they are cheaper. Medela makes a great breastpump but do not be fooled into buying their bags!"
5,Elegant fragrance,"I think Antica Farmacista has the finest home fragrances available. Yes they are more expensive than most brands but their scents are sophisticated, pure and long lasting without being overwhelming. There isn't a scent in the product line that isn't wonderful but my personal favorite is Santorini. It's warm and fresh with floral notes, very complex and lovely, not too feminine and not too masculine. It smells like an ocean breeze blowing over bouquets of verbena, bergamot,vetyver and sandalwood in the early spring mornings on the island of Santorini. Ahhhhhh!"
4,Heaven in a bottle,"I bought this item when it was on sale at nordstroms and sadly, I only purchased one diffuser. So far, amazon has the least expensive price but THIS is heavenly!! It doesn't freshen large rooms, you would have to buy several for that. But I put it in my bathroom and it's as though I'm walking in to romantic oasis! Who knew that 3 little ingredients could smell so good!"
3,Scent is very nice/product does not last long,"The scent of this product is fresh and appealing. However, the liquid fragrance evaporates at a rapid rate. For the money, a better choice for a similar product is Alora reed infusers. They last for over a year. I don't think this one will make it five months."
5,one of the best,"Being fairly new to punk, I kept an open mind while I was listening to it. After only a song or two, I knew that this group and album were an instant hit. Although I only have this one real hard punk album this album made me want to run out and buy numerous more. THis is now one of my favorite albums, and I haven't stopped listening to is since I got it."
2,poor customer service,The DVD is fine. The customer service was not. WIll never use this seller again.Within 10 minutes I contacted the seller to say my church has also just bought all of the Nooma Series. The seller would not allow me to cancel. All others did.
2,Ok...but $11.99 for a 10 minute DVD?????,"Come on, people....why????? These used to be $9.99, not almost $12??? Is this greed? Or am I not getting it?"
4,good product,"the plantar fascitis boot, was an excellent buy for apporx $30 consideringthe same boot at the medical supply store with my Rx was going to cost$150. as far as how well it worked...well, i dont think it did that muchfor my plantar fascitis, but fortunately i dont have that much pain as alot of people do. Mine is just annoying and i keep aggravating it so it doesnt go away. the boot isn't the most comfortable, but sleeping with a boot wouldn't be anyway would it?? but all in all i think its a good buy and well worth it for someone that has a moderate to extreme amt of foot pain."
3,Very good Night splint... But,"I am using this night splint because I have Achilles tendinosis. I can recommend it 100%. My pain has decreased a lot. It is comfortable BUT probably not for a long night because it sometimes makes soar my leg. Medium is oK for my 9,5 size feet.Good material. Good velcros. It is not easy to walk with it, difficult to go to the bathroom during night.ADVICE: checkActive Ankle Dns Dorsal Night Splint Small (men 5-10 Women 5-9 1/2)that I am also using and is more comfortable and easier to walk around. Ahh, and if this review has been helpful please ..... thank you!"
4,pro-tec works well,"Unfortunately, my plantar problem rose its ugly head after 15 yrears. My old splint was worn out and this one took its place. I like the padding,which my old one did not have."
2,too uncomfortable-toes go to sleep,"I have plantar fasciitis. Wearing a night splint is supposed to help with the healing. This is a well-made night splint. The materials are very nice. However, the design of the angle, which dorsiflexes your foot past 90 degrees is too uncomfortable. As you roll around in bed trying to get comfortable with this thing, your foot begins to slide upwards ever so slightly to the more natural 90 degree flexion, which then compresses your toes against the bottom plate. Then your toes go to sleep. After about two hours, you can't stand the pain in your toes and take the boot off and throw it out of bed. I do not recommend this item. I went back to just wrapping my foot/ankle with an Ace wrap to try and hold it as close to a 90 degree position as possible. Even this can get uncomfortable, but its better than the rigid night splint."

1,KLO-Idaho,The most annoying thing about this CD player is that it only has one battery which means it doesn't last long.
2,Does not work for every car,I purchased this produce to use in my car and my tape kept ejecting the cassette which connects the player to the car's sound system. I'm not sure if it is defective (sellers return policy was a nightmare so I gave up) or just won't work in my car (the manual said it may not work in every car).
3,"Not what Expected, sound is not great (with car kit)","The sound in the Cd player is OK, But I bought it for my Camry 94 when i Use the car kit the sound is not what I expected.. the volume is low and quality too, the sound of a cassette is better. Dissapointed.The goods easy to use, good sound with out the kit."
4,beautiful BW photographs,I just got this book from the library. It many well printed BW photographs. There is some math discussion on fractals but there is no discussion of computer software for generating fractals pictures. Still a great book.
4,A good primer on fractals and an excellent introduction to their appearance in nature,"Looking around in nature, it is easy to find examples of fractals. Individual plants, forests, volcanic activity, wind and water erosion, the flow of water and the movement of plants with the wind can all be described by an appropriate fractal function. Most of the pages of this book are taken up with spectacular images of such natural fractals. A few of the pages are devoted to the mathematical background used to generate the images. It is not rigorous; it was the author's intention to only give some of the general ideas rather than a complete description. They are understandable, even if your math background stops at algebra. Although it was written in 1991, this book is still an excellent primer on what fractals are as well as the large number of ways that they appear in nature."
1,Not what I hav ordered,"The part that I have received is not the part I have ordered, the one I ordered was for 2004 GTO and the one I received was for 2005, had to give it to a friend."
1,America's Greatest Band,"I must say after listening to this cd I was flabbergasted. The singer is incredible and definately unique.She sounds nothing like Debbie Harry as others have suggested.My favorite song is ""Back to Ohio"". Nothing trite about that one.I can't beleive I found this for a quarter. Does any one know if they have any other material released?This cd restores my faith in new American music.No more boring British prog rock for me."
3,"An interesting idea, but not necessarily for a book","Luc Delahaye is a Magnum photojournalist who has made some amazing reportages from the world's war zones over the last decade. L'Autre however, is not a book of these photographs. Between 1995 and 1997 Delahaye took photographs of passengers on the Paris Metro with a hidden camera. The close-up vertical portraits show people of all different ages and races staring off into space in typical subway fashion. The book closely resembles fellow Magnum photographer Gilles Peress' 1995 book The Silence in design, and besides this interesting design I do not think the book is too incredible. The photographs did not need to be put in a book."
3,A Great T.V. Show,I am so glad that they are making a Highway To Heaven on dvd. I gave this dvd 3 stars because some of the guest stars were not very good but Michael Landon and Victor French were good.I can not wait for this to come out.Highway To Heaven is one of my favorite T.V. shows
3,Where is the closed caption?,"My problem was that this series did not come with closed caption. I ordered it for my deaf mom who uses closed caption on her TV. She had watched the Little House on the Prairie series until the DVD's were worn out and I thought this would be a nice change for her. We were really disappointed, especially when Highway to Heaven came out after the Little House series."
5,"Feel good show, with fairytale endings.","If you are into happy endings, and a general feel good vibe for a show then this is the show for you. If that sort of thing doesn't float your boat, then steer clear.Sometimes Jonathan (the angel) has angelic strength against thugs/bullies and alike; but more often than that it's his compassionate heart, kind words and the value he brings to an individual that give this show it's ""feel"". Mark, his non-angel helper who joined him after Jonathan's first mission, are on an assignment from God to right the wrongs, encourage the broken hearted and restore broken relationships as they encounter people along the way. My wife and I enjoy this series, although there are some tear-jerker episodes (touch the moon) that catch you unaware. 10/10 for the show!"
1,Edited episodes suck!,"Grew up watching this show with my family and love it! (Same with Little House)It is a great shame that A&E; (and Genesis Entertainment) released the edited versions which are chopped up and have anywhere from 30 sec to as much as 3 min of scenes missing per episode! And they inserted commercial breaks where they were not intended. To make matters worse A&E; has only released the first 3 seasons and there are, from what I can find, no plans to release seasons 4 and 5. This is terrible. What will it take to release all the original episodes unedited and all seasons on DVD?! I know fans will pay for it if they'd just give us a chance! Fans DO NOT BUY THESE DVDS - if they see people aren't buying this bastardized version they may finally release the full unaltered episodes and all 5 seasons. Please correct this travesty :("
5,pleased again,This was purchased as a gift and the person was thrilled with it and I was thrilled with how quickly it came. thank you
5,I got this for my mom for xmas,"and basically, its a good collection. nice dvds. good packaging. if you like this show then this is a must have."
2,Dulcimer Book by Jean Richie,"The contents of the book may be great, but the pages have started falling out of the center of the book & I was just fanning through the pages after it arrived. Not impressed with the quality considering what I paid for it."
3,Ouch,"I normally use the curcumin product sold by Nature's Way (""Tumeric""), but was hoping to get a better price and purer form of the herb. The price was better, but but the unbuffered form caused a meltdown in my stomach, so I've gone back to Nature's Way."
4,Great for joint arthritis,"Have been using product (curcumin) for 2months and am experiencing less arthritis pain in all joints, my wife has now started taking it."
5,Must Have,My doctor recommended that this be a mandatory supplement to take daily. Love this brand and love to receive this on auto shipment. Great product.
4,Great source of tumeric,I have purchased NOW vitamins for many years and always find the quality to be excellent.
2,95% curcumin and 5%?,Once I received the product I learned that Magnesium stearate and Stearic Acid isn't good for you. I'll stick to USDA organic or 100 organic products. I never used the product.
3,"Comfortable, but not worth it.","This does add some padding, but does take up space and is awkward. I didn't even use this on the flight home. Not really worth the money, more of a novelty really."
5,AWSOME!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"It is the greatest!i play with it all the time I just love it!i got this along with jango kamino escape (which you HAVE to have),obi wan corucsant chase,and 2 geonosian warriors and i am crazy about star wars now!you have to get this its the most fun toy i have ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good music, bad typos","I grew up on Guy Mitchell, and have had a hard time getting a CD of his music. Even my beloved Amazon.com had to cancel a previous order for non-availability. I finally got my hands on two copies of 20 Greatest Hits, one for me and one for my dad. This collection had the three main songs I wanted: My Truly, Truly Fair; Chicka Boom; and Cloud Lucky Seven. The music is fine, just as I remember. Guy Mitchell's voice reminds me of Dean Martin a little. However, the packaging has more typos than I can count, leading me to believe that Prestige/Elite Productions is based in a non-English-speaking country. Either that, or it was written in a terrible hurry by someone who does not write much. That may not bother most people, but it does bother me. That said, the music quality is quite good, and I am happy with the sound."
1,Great- For a little while!,"I purchased this coffeemaker 2 months ago after reading its great reviews at several different websites. It was great for about a month and half. Now the coffeemaker somehow leaks water every time it's used. I'm talking about a puddle of water underneath the machine! Since it's past the 30 day mark since purchasing this item, I'm unable to exchange it. Cuisinart charges you $10 for shipping and handling to receive a new item under the warranty, plus you have to pay for shipping to send the machine to them. So, by the time you get the new coffeemaker, you payed the price for two!"
5,Excellent Value,"There are several points of praise for this coffee maker. The no-drip spout on the pot itself is a most welcome feature. It is a simple design with no bells and whistles. The water level readout is clear and easy to see and the two temperature setting for the base heating element ensures a half pot or less doesn't get a burned taste. We've had this coffee maker for almost two months now and make on average two to three pots of coffee a day. Time will tell whether durability is yet another positive feature of this coffeemaker. If I had to name a negative, the only point I could identify is the country of manufacture--China. I think the balance of trade is way out of whack, so I purposely look for non-China made products. But alas, my options currently are very limited. Are you listening manufacturers?"
2,DISAPPOINTING CUISINART,"I'm sorry I went for a cheap Cuisinart. I should have known I would not be happy with this for long. It has a glass pot which means eventually it will have a very unhappy ending for me. It doesn't automatically shut off. Half of the time I use it, I forget until I smell burning coffee. It has one of those tricky catches so you can take off the pot while it's brewing but again, if the pot isn't inserted just right, you'll have a mess all over the counter. You have adjustments for the number of cups you are making so if you forget to adjust that the coffee can be horrid. I think I'll just put it away for the days I have to make a full pot for company."
2,one dumb feature too many,"I bought this because--of the options available at the time--it most closely resembled, in shape and simplicity, the Black & Decker EuroBrew we'd been using (whose element went bad.) Except for one thing: There's a little dial gizmo at the top, the stated purpose of which is to prevent your ground coffee from being over-extracted (thus becoming bitter.) According to the directions, brewing this perfect, non-bitter, coffee involves using twice as much coffee as you would on an ordinary machine. (12 scoops for a 6 cup pot, for example.) I already buy excellent organic, free-range (I mean, um, shade grown,) coffee which, brewed normally, tastes way better than anything from coffee shops which shall remain nameless. That's not cheap coffee to buy, and I'm not keen to use twice as much unnecessarily. Plus, even following the rules, I keep ending up with watery, insipid coffee, and that makes me cranky. I just ordered a replacement Black & Decker."
1,Not a good choice !!!,"Bsides thr fact it ""died"" after only 3 months of use, it was a poorly designed appliance.The basket was difficult to put into closed position and made for a couple of BIG messes !!!The pot would not easily leave the heating surface on a few occasions for reasons I have yet to determine.Thought that the name Cuisinart guaranteed a good appliance --- well, that was a big mistake on my part."
2,Could someone please enlighten me?,"For some reason I'm having trouble making a decent pot of coffee with the DCC-100. Every pot I've made has turned out to be a disaster. I'm using bottled water and I've tried two different coffees (Folgers Classic Roast and maxwell house) that I normally like and they've turned out terrible. It's the same coffee I use in my little 4 cup kitchen-aid coffee maker that makes great coffee.How much coffee are you guys using, and what settings do you use? If I can't make a good pot within the next week or so this thing goes back. Please help."
1,Dangerous Coffeemaker,"I got this coffeemaker as a gift, and now am the proud owner of a 2nd degree burn on my arm. The swing out filter basket did not filter the hot water through and created a big mess and water was stopped up in the filter area. I unplugged the coffeemaker and shut the filter basket and carefully carried the coffeemaker to the sink to pour out. The swing out filter opened and poured scolding hot water all over my arm, sending me to the emergency room for 3 shots of morphine for the pain.This was the second time I used the coffee maker.I would suggest a different coffee maker."
2,Great coffee pot,"I really like this Cuisinart coffee maker. I had received one as a gift for use at our lake cabin, and I ordered another identical for use at home."
4,Cuisinart DCC-100 Coffee Bar Classic 10 cup Coffeemaker,"This is the second time I have purchased this model coffeemaker. Over the years I've owned Bunn, Krups and Cuisinart. By far, the most consistantly good coffee comes from this little Cuisinart. I agree that you have to get the knack for pouring, or the coffee drips & if you do not carefully line up the swing out fliter you will get spillover. However, after the first few tries I did not have any problems at all. I was so happy with the years of service with my first one I went right out and bought it again."
1,Good Coffee - Bad Design,"This pot make great coffee, but it is a disaster waiting to happen. The swing-out filter holder can appear to be closed (in the brewing position) but it is really not. As a result, all of the coffee runs out on the floor. Same thing happens if don't have the filter in exactly the right position. Coffee all over the place. This pot proves the old adage...you get what you pay for....and it was very cheap."
2,Just OK,"After cracking the carafe again on my 12 year old Braun Idecided to replace the machine. I ran across this one at Wards [and] it had the 1-4 and 4-10 cup brew cycle I was looking for. It makes good coffee but the shape of the carafe makes pouring the last 2 to 3 cups difficult. The shape also makes it hard to reach inside and clean (fortunately I have lovely, petite hands). The swing out filter is much harder to open and close than my Braun was. I will replace this new coffeemaker with a Braun or Krups today."
1,Cuisinart DCC-100 Coffee Bar Classic,"This coffeemaker is definitely a low-end product. The swing-outfilter basket retainer binds when swinging in and is difficult tounlatch to swing out. The much touted ""coffee bar"" flavor leavesmuch to be desired for anyone who loves good coffee."
3,Just right for me,"Although just right for me, here are the caveats: the hot plate is a little too hot, so if you make only two cups the second one tastes burnt after about 15 minutes and if you're not very careful the hinge of the lid and the thingy on the bottom of the filter holder that allows you to pour while the machine is still dripping break easily. Yes, this is the second one I bought and now I know to be careful with those parts. I bought the same one again because the price is right, there are no silly and useless electronics like timers, uses No. 4 cone filters, and ultimately makes very good coffee."
3,"When it works, it works well","I have had two of these - they make wonderful coffee, especially when you use a brown paper filter (white filters leave a metallic aftertaste). The problems: the pause-and-serve broke almost immediately on both brewers; the filter-basket enclosure stopped sealing securely after a few months on both brewers, causing hot water to spray out; the carafes are expensive and hard to find."
1,Broke within 2 months!,"We bought this coffee maker because we like Cuisinart products and wanted something new... and we were intrigued by the ""coffee bar taste"" description. When we got the machine, we loved it. We brew 1 pot per day and occasionally brew some for after dinner. We have owned the pot for less than two months and yesterday the water would no longer run through the machine! We checked the drip-pause feature and that isn't the problem. The water just sits in the reservoir and never reaches the coffee grounds. NO MORE COFFEE! We are very disappointed."
4,I got a bargain,"when I bought this coffeemaker from Amazon. It makes great tasting, and hot, coffee. I gave this to my mother and she loves it. Seeing some of the reviews below, I was concerned about durability. But my parents have been using it daily for the last few months, with no problems. At this price, you can get a run of the mill disposable coffeemaker, or get the Cuisinart, and get better tasting coffee."
2,Great coffee...but not for long!,"This machine made great coffee..for about 6 months. The adjustable strength valve-system that allows for ""all of the strength, but none of the bitterness"" just stopped working (plugged valve created leaks). A real shame! It's the best coffee maker out there, but as other reviews here confirm, it just won't last."
2,"Great Coffee, Dicey Machine","I purchased this coffee maker two weeks ago. It hit all the must-haves on my list: swing-out paper filter holder, external water gauge, easy to handle/clean carafe, not too big, simple on/off switch. It worked like a dream and the coffee was great...for about two weeks. That bad sound of water dripping all over the counter and floor this morning alerted me to a big problem: my breakfast was leaking out of the back of the coffee maker. I'll try another one (defective machines happen), but advise future purchasers to heed the warning and keep all the packing material to hand for a while."
4,Good Chill Out The Police Compilation,"This a very good Album if you are into Chill Out music. Good for a night out, even good for the office. Buy it !!"
2,The julienne disc has limited value,"I bought this hoping to use it to prepare Matchstick-size vegetables. The julienne disc included in this set does nothing different than the shredding disc which comes standard with the machine.It works fine on harder foods like potatoes and carrots(rendering a ""julienne"" very similar to a shred.) It absolutely pulverizes any water-based vegetables like peppers & squash. I experimented extensively with different foods and I only got the perfect julienne on very hard foods.The blades are also difficult to clean.For my money, I prefer the ""french fry disc"". But, if you like shoestring fries, this is the disc for you."
5,Great addition to food processor,The specialty disks allow you to grate and slice different sizes just by switching the blade. The cutting edges are sharp and effective.
2,ok,The blade on this product was stiff and I refrain from using it. I do not want to chance scratching my black truck
2,Not for me,"Didn't like this item at all. When I used it to clean my shower doors, it made so much noise, the sound traveled thru the entire house. Besides being heavy and awkward, it didn't clean the water off very well. So, I thought I'd use it on my windows. Well, that didn't work either...........so I ultimately returned it for a refund, but had to pay the shipping."
2,not impressed,"Well I got to say Amazon performed flawlessly, but the product itself sux I find that you really have to bare down way to hard to get it to squeegee water I'll never use it."
3,Great CD - but DRM eliminates MP3 player option!,"As with the other reviewers of this entertaining CD, I am struck by the quality of Rachel's music. Unfortunately, I am EXTREMELY disappointed that she chose to make it impossible for people who have bought the CD to either load it onto their computer (I have a Wi-Fi network at home and stream my digital music collection to my home stereo) or download to their MP3 player (I use one on walks and at at the gym all the time). Place this CD in your computer, and an ""FBI warning"" screen pops up and then - NOTHING! Amazon's listing of this CD has no mention of the copy protection included on the CD.If I had known that before I bought the CD, I would not have bought it! I have no time to deal with digital rights management nonsense that interferes with my legitimate rights to enjoy my music in alternate formats ...Don't support this nonsense.Too bad, its really a good CD ..."
3,"Somehow, left me feeling bleak....","This version of Rebecca's life left me feeling that some would certainly have a misconstrued picture of who Rebecca was if they were to make the mistake of not actually reading the biblical text. While the story was readable, the writer certainly used creative license in the re-telling of the story. Enjoy this with that knowledge."
1,R.A. Zilber,"The writing is flat and lacks insight.Not only are the Women of Genesis series written in a mechanical wooden style, the facts are twisted,and the stories are vulgarized."
3,"Card Filler, yackaty yack yack","This book has too much of Card's chatty filler. Yackaty yack yack. What happened? Did he hurry to the editor's a little prematurely? The beginning of the book was great until the mother was revealed and then yackaty yack yack. I never thought the bible intended Isaac to sound like a vulnerable wimp lacking so much self esteem he prefered his elder son's physical prowess to his younger son's cerebral sensitivity.Other than the loquacious dialogue, this bible rendition was rather cool."
2,not worth the effort to grate hard cheeses,I use a lot of parmiagiano cheese and thought it would be easier to grate with this disc. The cheese gets stuck at the top of the grater disc and you have to constantly take the top off the processor and free up the cheese to continue. I think my OXO hand grater does a better job with less effort.
5,Wonderful for Parmesan and Chocolate,"Using this disk and my Cuisinart is so much easier than grating hard Parmesan on a Microplane grater. I use this whenever I need more than a couple of tablespoons of hard cheese. Since I usually make Italian food this disc has been a great help in my kitchen.If you hate grating your own Parmesan on a microplane give this a try, I think you will love it.It is also nice for grating dark chocolate so that it melts more quickly in a double boiler.I highly recommend this product."
2,Fine Grater Disc not foo fine!,"The bad thing I found out about this grater was the fact is does not have holes which go through to the other side as do other discs. Therefore, what happens is that anything passed through the shoot comes out mushy. The ideal grater disc would be to have the same design as other discs to release the product through the bottom. Take heed Cuisinart."
2,Does not fit Elite Collection models,I have no idea whether this works well or not but was advertised for 14c Cuisinart models. It does not fit in the Elite Collection version - Beware!
2,Unnecessary,"Unless you want very fine grated cheese, the standard grater works fine to provide a coarser result, which I prefer."
2,Too too fine,"Live and learn. This fine disc is really fine, far too fine for any kitchen task I could think of to use it for. The next next finest grater is also very fine and adequate for any use I can imagine."
5,I wish I knew Susan Branch . . .,"Reading her book just makes you love her!Everything I've made we at the very least liked, most of the time loved. My husband said that her cheesecake recipe makes the best plain cheesecake he has ever tasted."
3,"Beautiful to look at, but not to use","I purchased this intending to give it as a gift as I love home style cookbooks with cute artwork. After purchasing it I decided not to give it as a gift as many of the recipes are rather exotic. If you are looking for an adorable cookbook with down to earth recipes, I'd recommend Gooseberry Patch instead."
3,Heart of the Home,The book arrived a bit yellowed and looked aged. Not really what I expected from a rating that it was new and excellent condition.
4,No Mercy?/Pity,"Sure I liked ""Theatre of Blood"".What got me was the lack of remorse from Diana Rigg.She watches poor George Maxwell get butchered by a drunken mob with no feelings.Think about the murder settings.Do not you think the policemen could of heard Chloe Moon scream(Even a gagged scream)?Would not there have been police around the hair salon?Do not you think the police have lab work to investigate murders?By the way which one of ""The Meth Drinkers""was Tutte Lemkow?Jeffrey Lynn Haag is my name."
5,Theatre of (Real) Blood,"The ""Theatre of Blood ""in this DVD is a much better copy than the usual esp. British version. This copy is the proper cinema widescreen size and seems to be a better print. If you wish to see a superior British tongue in cheek horror-comedy with the redoubtable Vincent surrounded by his excellent thesbian contemporaries this is the one. I saw it in 1973 when the world was pretty ratty and everyone sane needed a long cynical laugh. This is the movie that gives it.Well done Vincent and friends.Long may you all be remembered!"
1,Flimsy,Grates fall out of place easily. They are held up by 3 small tabs that stick out inch. The ash catcher has a wooden handle that cracked on me after 1 use. I have had it for 3 weeks and used it 1 time and it is already starting to rust. I can't imagine this thin making it thru the summer. It was a total waist of 20 dollars.
3,Slow going,"This book reads like it was written in Russian, then translated (awkwardly). Frequently, the run-on sentences made little sense, until read two or three times, then the point reluctantly emerges. Not exactly a page-turner."
1,Magnificent in its Uselessness,"Wilson succeeds in writing some of the worst ""history"" ever. Tearfully boring (as is usually the case with literature experts who write history), Wilson's obviously enamored with Communism and Lenin, and so neglects to consult available historical references that would have given a better-rounded and accurate picture of the events of the time. This book is an incredible example of how not to write history. In over thirty years of avid reading, I have never been lulled to sleep so many times by a single book as this one."
3,CD not attached,"The book itself and student companion web site is great! However, students who will be needing SPSS 17 with the text should be careful when purchasing CD. Only purchase from Pearson and seek advice from web site should there be any problem with installation of SPSS software."
1,Minces than julienne,I was very disappointed with this blade. I expected to get julienned carrots & zuchini and ended up with minced pieces. I have a 7 cup processor and tried different veggies but all with the same result. Its not worth owning. I've been using the slicer and shredder blades from cuisinart for 4 years (4 times a week) and they do a wonderful job. Wish there were better julienne blades than this one :(
3,Not quite strong enough for carrots,"This works fine for zucchini and SOFT potatoes and carrots, but it kind of jams the machine if you put hard carrots or potatoes in it with this disc. Maybe if you nuke (microwave) them a little beforehand, it might work great. I haven't tried that yet, though.Also, since it's a disc, everything comes out curved. So if you want traditional straight julienned veggies, you'll have to cut them by hand or find a different machine.But if you don't mind curved veggies, then no problem. It does a great job on zucchini, and I would guess, on eggplant, too."
2,Cuisinart DLC-833TXAMZ 3-by-3mm Medium Square Julienne Disc,"I thought this disc would cut down on my manual time of cutting up veggies, but it shreds more than juliennes. I was disappointed."
3,Hit or miss,this cutter does work but does not really work well. Carrots for instance are nearly impossible to keep in the input flat for match stchstick cuts. Some will be good many wil be Ok but there is no consistency
2,Not Happy,"I wanted this blade so that I could duplicate the julienned carrots I buy at Trader Joe's. Received as a gift, the blade was quite dusappointing. The result is very similar to the shredder blade that came with my 7-Cup cuisinart; definitely not worth buying. Cuisinart would be wise to redesign this blade, since everyone likes julienned veggies! They could take a lesson from Trader Joe's."
2,Get the Scotch Tape,"It is a nice looking book. I like that the P's and D's are together- However, the coins fall out; I only want to put them in once. Also, the coins can only be viewed on one side."
1,Disappointing,This folder looks great. Too bad it does not hold the quarters. One would buy a folder like this to help save the commemorative coins. Just don't ever open it. The quarters simply fall out.
4,Collector's favour,This product is well designed and full of educational information. The quality of the folder is very good. We love it.50 State Quarters Collector's Folder: 1999-2008 Denver & Philadelphia Mints
1,Not happy with purchase,I was disappointed and had to send it back as it wasn't what I wanted. I didn't realize that it was for quarters from both places they mint the state quarters and I just wanted a folder for one quarter for each state and I wasn't concerned that I had one from each place. I didn't realize they printed them in two places anyway. Richard Risener
2,Looks great. Works well... for a while.,The first KUA-17 we bought was replaced under warranty after 15 months. Not good for an expensive kettle. Now the identical replacement has gone on the blink after 12 months. We are quite heavy users... boil water maybe four times a day for drinks... but that shouldn't be a problem... It's the same electrical connection problem between the base and the kettle as extensively described on other negative reviews. Obvioulsy a bad design. Can't be bothered to go through with another warranty claim. This time it's going in the trash can - where it belongs. Bottom line? Not a good buy. We had problems with an unreliable (and expensive) Cuisinart toaster earlier this year so this brand is now on our 'AVOID' list. Cuisinart used to be very good. What happened?
2,expect two year life at most,"When I saw an electric water kettle in Europe, I thought I had to have one. I found this Cuisinart model here and for about 9 months it worked well on a 2-3 use/day basis. Then the internal switch contacts failed due to a combination of metal failure from overheating and plastic damage also from overheating. Both of these were near the internal switch contacts.I will give Cuisinart credit that they replaced that unit under the 1 year warranty.The replacement has now failed after about another year. This time the failure is in the base and it was caused by the failure of the push on clips on the wire ends. One failed from overheating and destroyed the spring contact it was connected to.In addition the ""stainless"" steel pot is showing some rust on the inside.I expected more from Cuisinart."
1,Avoid this kettle!,"I bought this kettle refurbished from Cuisinart. We use it regularly--probably everyday. About 1 week after the 90 day warranty expired it stopped working. I had read about others that have had the same problem, but knowing Cuisinart, figured it was just bad luck, since they make such great products. When I contacted customer service, they would do nothing for me. AVOID this kettle. Buy one from some one else, or a non refurb. I've never been so disappointed with a Cuisinart product."
1,Terrible Design -- DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL,"We got this kettle, and it worked well for just under a year. Then it died. The problem had something to do with a faulty connection between the base and kettle, which made it impossible to boil water. I called a Cuisinart office in New Jersey (it was still under warranty), and they offered to replace it for ""free,"" but they charged us shipping both ways. So we got a replacement kettle, which worked for about nine months, and once again the exact same thing happened. It wouldn't boil water anymore. Well, once again, I called them back again, and they sent us another replacement, but charged us shipping again. Clearly, it is most likely only a matter of time before it dies again."
5,This is a great appliance,This is a great appliance. I don't have to worry about boiling the kettle dry and melting it on the stove anymore.
3,an okay teapot,"received this pot for father's day exactly 1 year ago today. This morning, on it's 1 year anniversary, it no longer works. Will I replace it with the same modeL? No... It's very slow at heating water and, as some others have noted, it's a little awkward to poor. But, it wasn't a horrible teapot either."
2,Great - while it lasts,"Looks good. Easy to use. BUT... I've bought 3 of these: one died after 15 months, one after 12 months, the last my son toasted by putting it on a hot stove top ring (he has a design flaw too)."
1,Everything tastes like Plastic,"After 2 months, all water that comes out of this teapot tastes like rubber.Cusinart Customer Service is the worst. They don't answer or acknowledge email at all.When you get them on the phone, they want you to pay shipping both ways to exchange a defective product.If you live in California, this is against the law -- then they want you to go through an arduous process of waiting for a UPS call tag.All told, it will take at least 30 days to get my teapot repaired. And if the problem happens again, then what?Avoid at all costs."
1,A big disappointment,"Although this is advertised as a stainless steel kettle there is a plastic element inside. As a result the water tastes and smells like steamed plastic. It is vile, and probably a health hazard."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS KETTLE!!!!!,I have bought this kettle brand new from amazon and after 3 months it stopped working. It was supposed to have a warranty but trying to contact a representative from cuisinart is impossible so I sent them an email. They responded by saying that their is no warranty for my model. It's been about two weeks since sending amazon a note about this problem and no one has gotten back to me.
1,Great while it lasted,"Really loved this kettle and used it everyday, but it gave out on us after 6 months. The previous model made by Cuisinart was better, although it was not cordless, it lasted many years (actually the older model still works, it's just a little corroded inside). So I figured this newer model would be even better. Considering how expensive it was, it should have lasted longer. I'm very disappointed as I thought Cuisinart usually made solid products."
1,Fire hazard ?,After my first one failed I contacted the manufacturer who sent me another. This one is going in the trash as well and I will not be getting anymore of their products. The wiring on the heating base has overheated and melted the plastic base and I'm sure that if I wasn't home my mother in law would have burnt the house down. Sure it shuts off when the water comes to a boil but the internal wiring gets hot enough to melt the unit.......that doesn't sit well with me. Especially for $65. Another wonderful china made product !!!
3,Died after 2.5 years,"Even though this kettle died way before I feel it should have, I am giving it three stars because of how little plastic is used on the inside. I don't want boiling water to help leech BPA from the kettle's innards into my tea. Also, while it worked, it did work great. Still, after reading some of the stories on this site about people's experience with Cuisinart's customer service, I think they are a pretty awful company.I am now trying to find a similar kettle that is more reliable."
2,Good while it lasts (which isn't long),"I really liked this product while it lasted, but it should have lasted far longer! I had it for about two years before it just died. My mum has been using the same electric kettle for over a decade, and I thought that by paying for the cuisinart name I'd be getting at least as good a product as hers, if not better. It was disappointing that it didn't last."
5,Had for 5 years and it's wonderful,I have had this kettle for about 5 years and just love it. I use it probably 5-8 times a day. I use it for water for tea and even when I need to boil something else because it is faster to boil water in this kettle and then pour it into the pot than it is to wait for the pot of water to start boiling. I ordered a new one today for my son-in-law for Christmas. It's a great asset to any kitchen.
2,It stopped stopping!,"After 1.5 years, this automatic tea kettle, which I use every day, stopped automatically turning off at a rolling boil. Indeed, I came into the kitchen and saw a shorted cabinet light because of the moisture from the steam. My fear is, if I completely forgot about it (which happens when I'm focused on my work) it my melt, destroy itself or worse!"
4,"Finally, tea in a flash!","This kettle works well and fast. Its compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens and it looks good enough to come to the table too!I could not give it five starts because of the handle which makes it a bit akward to handle and fill. The plastic part inside as others mentioned and I am not quite sure yet whether it affects the water or not. At first try the taste is not altered at all but I will keep an eye on it.I bought it because it was the most readily available, not my first choice but so far so good."
1,poorly designed electrical contacts,"I used to love this kettle. I've had this kettle for over four years now and it has developed the same problem as some of the people who gave it one-star reviews. The electrical contacts have degraded over the past few months and today I couldn't get it to turn on at all no matter how many times I twisted it around on its base.I've cleaned the contacts twice in the past few months to no avail. Maybe an improvement for all of a day each time.Looking inside the base, I can see why the contacts die -- they don't grip the metal ring & spike at all, but rather the ring and spike just rest on loosely sprung metal. Wish I'd thought to inspect that before buying it.There's no excuse for such a bad design. Were they hoping for a repeat buy? Not going to happen!"
2,Great while it works,"The Cuisinart is a great kettle while it works. We have two homes and this kettle at each home. The first gave out after about a year and the second in about two years. We bought this banking on the Cuisinart brand, but we won't buy another Cuisinart product after our experience with this one (or two)."
1,Good for 2-3 years.,"The base of this unit wore out just after the warranty ran out. We called Cuisinart to buy a replacement and were informed that they don't sell the base by itself and thus we needed to replace the entire unit. This is a colossal waste of money and resources. We will be looking elsewhere for our next kettle and other appliances, as well."
1,Problems with leaving water in kettle,"I purchased this kettle in 2005 and loved it. It was easy to use, boiled water quickly and looked good. After just less than a year it started to make a lot of noise when boiling water and eventually stopped working. I returned it and received a replacement kettle. Apparently you MUST empty the water out of it once you have used the kettle. Letting water sit in the kettle causes corrosion and damages the heating component. My second kettle is on its last legs because I use it all the time to make hot tea and I am too lazy to empty it after every use. I wont be buying the same kettle again. I find it odd that a kettle can corrode??????"
1,Unreliable,"STAY AWAY!! This kettle designed with a plastic contact mechanism (It is not visible, covered by the black bottom) which cannot stand the temperature of boiling water. It gradually melts, contacts getting loose, starts sparkling and eventually melts more plastic to make a SHORT CIRCUIT!!! Contacts are funny thin for it's power. I think it is made deliberately for shortening it life to force you to buy next one.After disassembling this mechanism, trying to figure out the way to repair this kettle I put it to garbage incinerator. No more Cuisinart!!"
3,"Really liked it - worked well. Just difficult to keep the exterior looking ""mirror""-like.","This electric tea kettle worked perfectly. It heats the water quickly and is easy to use. We used it successfully for about 2-3 years. My issues with the product are all aesthetics. For one thing, as the exterior accumulates water spots (which happens with a tea kettle where dripping and steam get on the surface) they don't wipe off very easily. Mine now looks really ugly and has smudgy spots instead of the ""mirror"" like look it has when it is new. Have tried cleaning many times but really difficult.The second thing is and if you have lazy family members like me then be careful to always empty it out after each use and take the top off so the interior can air dry. If not then eventually it will rust inside and is unsafe to use. That is what happened to us - but I can't blame the manufacturer for this b/c it's the nature of stainless steel. Just warn your lazy family members."
3,Limited Life,"I've had this electric tea kettle for about 3 years and its been great - heats very quickly and it doesn't whistle. My only complaint is that it seems to have a very limited life span. I've loved this kettle, but I'm not sure if I would purchase another because of the limited use period."
1,Disappointing and dangerous,"We bought this kettle just under a year ago and were happy with it up until last week. Somehow, the mechanism that should shut off the kettle when the water boils failed. This caused the kettle to boil dry AND melt the plastic bottom of the kettle rendering the unit unusable. This is also extremely dangerous and could have caused a fire and endangered everyone in the house. Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another one of these kettles, especially since it is expensive compared to other brands, it does not seem to have a boil dry safety mechanism, and it does not last very long. I will try to contact the company for a replacement since we have not even had it for 1 year yet, but I am not willing to spend too much time arguing with the company. There is no way I can recommend this product."
1,Doesn't reliably turn off,My kettle is about 2 years old and I have been very happy with it until recently. Now perhaps one time in 20 the kettle fails to shut off once the water has started to boil. I haven't waited long enough to see what happens when the kettle runs dry but this is a dangerous condition and could cause a fire - So be warned. (note: I'm not sure whether I bought this kettle from Amazon or not)
4,My favorite tea kettle,The kettle works well for my puropose---to make green tea each morning. It looks attractive on the counter.
2,great but will break,"I loved this teapot while it worked. Very pretty and boiled quickly. Then about 1 1/2 yrs down the road, it stopped turning off automatically and the cord got very hot and it started to smell. I was afraid it would catch on fire. I guess the auto off stopped working. I threw the base out. Too bad!"
2,disappointing life time,"This is a gorgeous kettle. Shiny, stainless steel, pleasing shape, really beautiful.For the first year, I had the occasional issue that it didn't stop heating after the water boiled (a bit dangerous). And now, 53 weeks into its use, it quit working. Very disappointing. At this pricepoint, the product should last for at least 5 years."
1,Others were right- AVOID this item,"I bought this after reading a review that said it just quit working after a few months. Mine did , too. I had a cheap one that lasted 7 years - this didn't even last 7 months."
5,Outstanding,"This tea kettle is simply devine to use - no cords in the way - no waiting for water to boil - just let it sit on your kitchen counter and it's all automatic. Looks beautiful, as well. I've purchased many as gifts and have one at home and one on the boat. Thanks Cuisinart for this product."
4,"Works good, just small","I really like this kettle. I've had it a month and it boils water fast. I like that the kettle is self contained with nothing to contaminate the water and that I can take the kettle off the base without a cord following me around. My only complaint is that I wish it was bigger. With my big mugs for coffee or tea, it only fills a couple at a time."
1,Died after one year,"It was a fine kettle, but after a year suddenly stopped working. Considering the price, one would expect more."
4,I have used it for over 5 years,"This is a great kettle. I have used it for over 5 years. There are 3 problems with the kettle which has led me to another to try. First, the handle is over the top of the refill lid. I use a french press coffee pot and often have to make fresh pots one right after another. When you remove the lid, the steam burns your fingers. Next, The shut off switch turns off way too early. I find myself turning it on a second or third time and as the pot has aged, it often doesnt shut off at all, it keeps reheating until you pick it up off the heat plate. Last, when you do finally get the kettle hot, the pouring spout spews water and you spill small amounts of it all over the counter. I give it 4 stars because the kettle is very well made. It has lasted for years and none of the plastic pieces have degraded. The kettle I am replacing it with is a chefs choice...stay tuned..It has a tough act to follow."
4,Stylish & Relatively Reliable,"This is one of the sharper-looking electric kettles around. We're on our third. The first one died about a month before the 3-year warranty expired and, to Cuisinart's credit, they replaced the whole thing without an argument. The replacement died about 2 years later, but the warranty doesn't start anew with the replacement model, so we were out of luck. They basically told us to buy a new one. That annoyed us, but after a lot of online research, it was clear that nearly all other models offer only a 1-year warranty, so we plopped down another $70 or so and have a shiny new kettle again. I may be old school, but I still think electrical appliances should last more than 3 years, but that's rarely the case anymore. So we went with the best available coverage, for a unit that's sleek and otherwise works well."
1,Dangerous,I loved this kettle. Everything worked great. Then I got up at5 a.m. and put the water on. When it was done I picked it up and the handle fell off! I was lucky I had a heavy robe on.Be careful. It looks like they used super glue to attach the handle and it failed. I'm sorry to write this but it's dangerous.
1,Dangerous Handle,"We used this kettle everyday for about 2 years and were very happy with it, until this week, when my husband was pouring boiling water from it, and the handle fell off. There's no sign of rivets or screws being used to secure the handle to the kettle. It looks like they just superglued it on, which can be very dangerous. Like I said, we've had this particular model for about 2 years, so maybe the manufacturer has redesigned the handle on its more recent products. If not, for safety reasons, I would not recommend this product."
4,Cuisinart's 3-year warranty makes this a good buy,"Love the kettle - stainless inside, quick boiling, solid feel. The outside does get hot - not great if your kids use it for their ramen noodles.Our kettle, like many others', failed after just under a year of daily use. I was reluctant to order another Cuisinart but my husband really liked this one and I insist on an all-stainless interior. Before I spent another $70+ I called Cuisinart to complain about the unit. With the serial number (no receipt), they determined that our unit was still within the 3-year warranty period and are sending a replacement free (I pay $7 shipping and send the old one back.)If the new unit last 11 months, like the first, I will still be under warranty and they'll send yet another replacement.If yours fails, call Cuisinart. It's so frustrating that the base-kettle connection fails over time but at least they replace them no questions asked.Cuisinart's Warranty Information:1-800-726-0190"
1,Stopped turning off after a year,"I bought this because of the recommendations and the reputation of Cuisinart products. We used the kettle daily, and after 13 months, it stopped turning off automatically. Then, you had to jiggle it into place to get it to turn on. Now it's in the trash. Planned obsolescence. Trying to save energy--ended up throwing it in the landfill."
1,"Bad electric, great kettle!","After 2 years, I loved and relied on this teapot..then it quit. But it has a 3 year warrantee! Called and was told that by the serial # it is out of warrantee! But I always write the date on my booklet that comes w/small appliances, and it still had 5 months! They wanted me to mail it to Ariz. $10 and they'd send me a new one. Annoying! It was a Mother's Day gift, purchased @ Bed & Bath, and if you take it there they will just give you a new one! YAY! We'll see how long it lasts! My daughter has one that is 7 yrs old. Must have had better electrics!"
1,Very disappointing performance - lasted 3 months!,"I buy American appliances which I import to the UK for use in American RVs over here (English voltage is 240v and will not work).I have bought a great many inexpensive electric kettles and never had a problem. This kettle was expensive and not worth the cost.The Cuisinart KUA-17 in my view is dangerous. In a little over 3 months since it was purchased it has developed a serious fault in that the electric cable gets very hot and the kettle will not function correctly unless the wire is physically pushed back into the base by hand. This is the kind of problem that could lead to a fire....a fire in a home is bad enough but just imagine being stuck in a burning RV!! I cannot send it back as the postage would be more than the kettle cost so it is going in the trash....would I buy another?? No, definitely not."
2,Warning: guests WILL destroy your kettle,"Two different visitors to my house mistook this kettle for a regular kettle and put in on the stove, melting the plastic bottom and filling the house with a lingering toxic smell. I replaced it the first time, but couldn't (and wouldn't) buy a THIRD $75 tea kettle. (My mother has also had a visitor melt this kettle.)Next time, I'm going to buy an electric kettle that will not get mistaken for a stove top. Probably the ""Chef's Choice 678 Cordless Electric Kettle""--my friend has one and the shape is different enough that no one has melted it."
1,More Chinese garbage for the landfill,"Very Disappointed. Like most water boilers these days the hot water touches plastic, absorbs plastic molecules (cancer here we come...) smells like plastic and tastes like plastic. I bought another brand many years ago with no plastic parts and was VERY PLEASED. It still works perfectly (at another house on another island...) But now everything's made in China and cheap and unsafe and plastic. The temptation of The Graduate and we're too far down that steep garden path to claw our way back. Not all of us. I tossed mine in the trash so it could find it's final resting place in the landfill as all Chinese product so quickly do; and now I'm back to boiling my water in a big old stainless steel pot Made in Japan. I think I'm over buying new stuff. Got enough stuff to last this incarnation. Except for books. Buy my book on Amazon."
4,BEWARE!,"I expected to be writing a review after a break-in period of a couple of months. As it is, I write but three days after purchase with the smell of burnt plastic permeating the house. I'd sure like to blame Amazon or Cuisinart and get a refund, but I'm afraid that would be stretching it. You see, my wife came downstairs early this morning to read the newspaper, reflexively lifted the kettle from its stand, placed it on the stove, turned on the gas, and forgot about it! So if you've been used to a traditional kettle for many years, BEWARE!P.S. The kettle was much as I expected from the reviews--a good value overall with a few relatively minor drawbacks: water shutting off somewhat short of boiling and therefore less than optimally hot, steam burning you if you tried to refill from the top, and not much quicker to heat than the aforementioned gas stove."
4,Ours lasted just under 6 years,We were given this kettle as an engagement present in 2003. We have used it daily for 6 years and now the electrical connection has become spasmodic. We were disappointed and suprised that it only lasted 6 years but on reading another review where the person said theirs only lasted 1.5 years we did get a good run out of it after all.
2,Great while it lasted,Pretty pricey considering it really does only last about a year and a half. Unfortunately they don't sell just the kettle. I'll be getting a different brand.
4,3 years as promised,"It lasted it's 3 year warranty as pomised by Cuisinart. Died one month one day after. I just ordered another one. Perfect kettle, But, 3 years!!!???"
3,good kettle overpriced,this is essentially the same as the hamilton beach kettle I previously had until my nephew put it on the stovetop. It has the same plastic bottom and heating componets. A good kettle just a little pricey.
4,Cuisinart electric tea kettle,"We have used electric tea pots for over 15 years, we were first introduced to them in the UK. This is our third Cuisinart and they all have been very good kettles. The simple design fits and kitchen decor, but best of all they do what they are supposed to without problem.Amazon's delivery of the product was wonderful and very quick."
5,So Far So Good,"Purchased for my husband who is notorious for leaving kettles to melt on the stove -- this product is very attractive, takes up minimal space on the counter, retractable cord design is super, and so far it works very well -- only time will tell, but it seems sturdy and well made --"
4,Electric Tea Kettle,Great product! I purchased it to replace a competitor's product that broke down less than 6 months after purchase. Very satisfied with Cuisenart kettle.
1,Bad Design,"I bought two of these, neither of them lasted very long. On one, the copper pin bent; on the second, the copper circle around the pin bent and broke. Don't waste your money."
2,Great while it lasts,"I've had two of these already. This kettle looks very nice and works very well, until it breaks. Both of them just stopped working after 2-3 years. I think the cause is the worn electrical connection in the base. Given the price and the brand name I expected this kettle to last longer."
3,One Year Wonder,"I am on my second Kettle. The first one lasted just over a year. I used it every day then it started to leak.I am hoping this one, now almost a year old, will last longer than its predecessor.A nice looking product and heats in a hurry. I just hope they have corrected the problem I had with the first."
3,O.K.,"Well the ink lasts long in the cartridge but at the botom of it is the problem. Once the the cartridge prints on a hard surface instead of the paper for example when there is a printer jam or no more paper, that is the end of the cartridge. It is no good anymore. It would not print good."
3,"Got Wrong Item, Good Customer Service","I received a product that was NOT what was advertised, and looked like it had been returned previously. I contacted the Seller who immediately refunded my money no questions asked. 3 stars for redeeming customer service."
1,Unhappy with my purchase.,"This item was unsatistfactory, doesn't work, I am not sure why it dont work. Now what do I do with it."
5,more for your money,"This printer works best with the 12A1980 color cartrige.I'venever had clearer pictures and documents,even at work... I highlyrecomend this cartrige to anyone that wants high quality imagesand documents at an affordable price."
3,Nice color cartridge,"This is a nice color ink jet cartridge (it's the only one I can use for my Lexmark Z11). It has nice color and performs well for the average home / light business user.However, it doesn't last very long and sometimes it doesn't even use all of the ink before the printer begins sending out error messages about the ink being low. That's why I gave it 3 stars, otherwise I would have been satisfied with it enough to rate it 4 stars.There is a higher yield cartridge (12A1985 for color, 12A1975 for black) that Lexmark has available for the Z11s and others. But these cartridges are also more expensive.It also tends to get a bit crumbly with time. But then again, so does some laser inks."
3,"COLOR IN, COLOR OUT","The Lexmark color cartridge is a good product. It serves the purpose, does the job and provides good color quality. I have been very pleased with the work I have put out when using this cartridge.First on my wish list, however, would be a longer lasting cartridge. I print for pleasure, not business and the amount of printing I do is minimal. The cartridge, however, seems to run low every other month. This is much faster than other printers and cartridges I have had in the past. I would like to see a cartridge that lasts longer so that I can change the title of my review from ""Color in, Color out"" to ""Color in and stays in""!"
2,Unpredictable quality,"I went through alot of these cartridges! It seems they use ink excessively (even when we were conscious of trying to print in ""draft"" mode,) and more often than I'd like to count, a new cartridge, just installed, would produce sub-quality prints ... leaving lines through the print, etc. Not happy."
4,A pretty good ink,The ink cartridge is good and can be used with Z11 (the printer I have) . The ink is waterfproof and hasnt given me any problems except that if you are printing transperencies you got to let it dry...otherwise it smears(atleast it did for me).The colors are crisp and overall I would recomend this( I guess with lexmark you can use only this ink).Overall a good product..not that we could buy something else for the printer ;)
1,PATHETIC piece of equipment!!!!,"Bought this and 3 Motorola SD4501 Digital Expansion Handset for SD4500 System Phones. I was banking on the MOTOROLA name. The batteries have an extremely short life, the voice hoarse and the product ABSOLUTELY Sucks. the most irritating feature is the Sync operation that kicks in halfway thru a conversation. This is probably the worst piece of equipment I have bought in my whole life. DO NOT BUY !!!! I wish Amazon had -ve ratings..... like a -5 STARS ."
2,"Disappointed, But a Workable Phone","We bought this phone at Costco with the 3 additional handsets. Overall the phone works as advertised.The good:- Color screens- Good sound quality- Speaker phone works great- Buttons are big and the phone works intuitively, once set upThe cons:- My major disappointment is the range. From garage is 40 feet from the house. Yet the expandable unit does not get the signal. Thus unable to use the intercom feature (one of the reasons for selecting this phone). My husband is back to using a standard wired phone in the garage.- The second, more minor, disappointment is the phone battery life. Previously we set our old model phones in the base occaisionally. These phones need to be in their base at least every other day."
3,Great Idea and Works but...,"I'm more likely to carry my cellphone and just use it rather than plug it into the dock. Audio quality very good. Only problem is that the phone simply rings for no reason every half hour or so. Even with no computer network or cell phone ""docked"", it just rings for no reason. I'm debating whether to retun it or determine if my DSL line is sending some signal that makes this phone (but not my other phones) ring, and yes of course I have my filter connected. Has anyone else had this trouble?"
5,Chaffeys and New Brunswick Canada- early history,"The Chaffey Dynasty of Indian Island, New Brunswick Canada, takes a fascinating glimpse into the history of one of the earliest families in this area. With pains-taking effort the author has collected historical documentation, photos and amusing anecdotes about the Chaffey family and the other families who were the first settlers of this beautiful coastal Canadian area. The book does not read like a dry reference source. The author has done a service to a small island that made a historical contribution to this region. How fortunate she must feel to be a summer resident of this island that was at one time so vibrant. The bustling of a shipping/ trading era has gone but the beauty apparently remains."
2,Black and White Photos!,"Wonderful book, except after the initial 24 pages of landscape pictures, half the photographs were in black and white. The ones in color were beautiful. My opinion, if you're going to do a decorating book, do it in color photography, or just make the book smaller. It was such a disappointment to turn the page and see a B&W interior photo of a lovely home, but have no idea of the color of the fabrics, carpet, walls, decoration. You just felt, well, deprived, and there were so many of these B&W pages. A decorating books should make you feel full of possibilities of what you can create and design. Save black and white photos for Time & Life pictures or Ansel Adams where they are terrific, not in a decorating book."
5,Nantucket Style,This is one of the best of many books I have on Nantucket. Great ideas and lovely photos of the houses and their interiors.
3,Glossary Included,"Perhaps this was a poor introduction to the writing of C.J. Cherryh. The best thing about the book was that it includes a glossary of sorts so you know how to pronounce all the names since they are all Celtic, Welsh, or Old English. Most of the first half of the book is spent introducing the characters and establishing their relationships, but very little is done until nearly midway through in establishing the plot or building to the climax. There is very little, if any foreshadowing, so there's nothing the reader can use to guess how things might turn out. I'm guessing ""Down Below Station"" would have been a better introduction to the writer."
2,Saddened,"My friend had this statue and I just couldn't wait to get it. I was saddened when it came with the ball not attached. I attached it myself rather thant send it back. However, I have only had it about a year and already the paint is peeling and the solar light has stopped working. I tried changing the battery but no luck. Can't say I would recommend it though she is lovely. Would love to know how to fix it if anyone knows. Too late to send back, I think."
2,Not worth the hefty price tag,Just not worth the $400 price tag due to the loud fan that is constantly on and the inability to record audio.
2,Wacky '80s DC randomness!!,"Wow! I thought this was kind of a reintroduction of Superman into the DC universe. At times, it seemed like it was. At others Superman would have some random adventure that comes out of nowhere. The stories here are all over the place. The art by John Byrne is, to me, the classic Superman. That's how I picture Supes in my head. This book might be good for nostalgia's sake but its not much of a read."
4,"A North-African ""Western""","Everything that you would expect in a western--the bragging, the shootouts, the fistfights, the outstanding horsemanship, etc., can be seen here. However, the setting is not the American West, but Algeria. Originally filmed in the 1930's, it features a young John Wayne. He is caught up within an Arab plot, the French Foreign Legion, and El Shaitan--a mysterious figure. Wayne is falsely accused of murder and gun-running, and is placed before the firing squad. The guns go off before the reprieve can be delivered. Is Wayne dead? See it and find out."
2,Poor functionality,"I needed an update for Calendar Creator 4 and bought version 10. Mistake! I've since bought version 5 to try getting back some of the lost functionality that version 4 had, but no luck. I had to jump through some hoops, including keeping a computer with Windows 98, to continue using version 4. Specifically, versions 5 and up have no provision to make event graphics small so multiple events on a given day will both print. Why Broderbund did this, I don't understand, but for my purposes, they ruined the product. I've had a number of Broderbund products and it's readily apparent they don't care if the product serves its purpose or not. I won't buy their stuff again."
3,OK calendar program,"I suppose this software tries to be all things for all people. My tastes are simple: no fancy backgrounds, no reoccuring dates, just something I can type into and post on my fridge. If MS Word had a template document then I'd be set. In which case I had to learn how to turn all the fancy stuff off which took a bit of time to figure out."
1,PLEASE NOTE - THIS DOES NOT RUN ON VISTA!,"You cannot run this application with Vista and because I spent too long with support (over 30 days) and waiting for them to ship - or so I thought, they would not refund my money."
4,Robert Merrill/Voice of Firestone,"Very enjoyable. ""Voice of Firestone"" was a favorite of mine on the radio and, of course, when it ultimately appeared on TV. Merrill is an all-time great and, as a geezer, the 'old' black-and-white didn't bother me in the very least. Now, transfer that VHS of Jerome Hines to DVD!!!"
1,Youth,"The cover is the best picture this book has to offer. Most of the pictures date back many years. There is not one picture that I would consider interesting or pretty. Coming of Age is a wonderful and complex time of a young man's life.This book deals with nothing of that sort. There are other books out there that truly show the joys of youth.It's your choice, but I wish I had not bought it."
3,Nice book,This book was ok. It was not what I expected it to be and hoped for more pictures and more in depth study of the subjects. It was a wide generalized pictoral/essay. I dont think I would buy the book again. The front cover was very nice but not much else in it.
3,Not what I expected...,"I ordered this thinking that the book would contain more photographs like the one on the cover, strong, sensual images of young men/boys making the transition from childhood to adulthood, and all that that entails. There were some great images in the book, the 15 yo matador and his family, the boy standing naked beside his fully clothed brother.... but there was a lot of wasted potential as well. As mentioned in other reviews, the photos of Indian boys towards the latter third of the book are somewhat out of place, but so is the final set of pictures (even though there are of a German teenager) that come from another of McBride's books.All in all, this book was something of a disappointment..."
4,"Awesome likeness, but man is it delicate.","The likeness to Temuera is incredible. The face is just awesome. The body armour and outfit look great once assembled, but there are some problems.1.) the body armour is cheap plastic and is difficult to secure2.) the jump suit is too baggy3.) he can't stand; the legs just can't support the figure at all"
4,Just Get It,"This toy looks sooooo cool.It comes with removable armour and clothes,two jetpacks(one with missile launcher),a missile,two blasters,a wihpcord,two darts,two flamethrower gauntlets,two wihpcord gauntlets,and a belt.JUST GET IT.(it's cool)"
3,Flimsy,"It's a good looking leash, but not as tough as you would hope. Doesn't seem like it's going to last for more than a year. We'll see, I guess. If you have a dog under 60lbs or so it's probably a non issue.Being a Yankees leash, it's probably not going to choke. Careful of those Red Sox leashes. Very hazardous."
2,Wowza,"This game has some of the worst AI I've seen yet. One drive you can throw for 100 yards, the next drive, every pass you throw is almost picked off. The way the AI works is so predictable and frustrating, that it makes this game worth nothing. This isn't anything new either. However, instead of cleaning up the AI or starting over to improve the game, they go ahead and buy out the NFL to make a monopoly. I've had my fair share of EA sports games, and I think it's about time to give up on them."
2,Same Old Same Old,"Do you have Madden 2005? If yes then do not buy this game. Own Madden 2004? Yes? Do not buy this game. EA actually takes a step backward with this addition of Madden as far as authenticity goes. QB vision and superstar mode, the 2 big additions to this year's version are not significant enough to warrant another $50. They will just bog down your system & make loading times, always a weak point in EA's titles, even longer. Stick with Madden 2005 or 2004 if you have them. Nothing has changed since then & they play every bit as good as Madden 2006."
3,Madden NFL 2006,This game is not what I expected from madden. It has new things that you can do...I just hope that next years is better
1,Madden blows my horn.,Well while i was a kid my favorita game was nintendogs meets mario but madden isnt very fun. my favorita team is the green bay packas and in dis game dey totally suck so i woulndt recomend this to any of u tru green bay packa fans. i would giv dis game a 23d5ff out of fetre. Nintendogs and dis game is compatible on ds sp color snes nes. they aint many caractars in dis game dats y i i dint lick it. i like donovan mcnabb but he asked me out and i said whose your owl udae sandhu is dumb what wiat a second jacky
1,I want a game that works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have purchased and returned THREE of these games and they all do the same thing!!!!!!! After my son picks his teams, it says that its loading and then it says that the disk is dirty or damaged. I am disgusted and would love a game that works."
1,Nix the Cuisinart DGB-300,"The machine produced fairly good coffee, but like others, I found the water tank almost impossible to clean. The machine died after a year, but was replaced under warranty. The second machine gave up the ghost about a year into it's life span. Part of the problem I believe is that the electronics reside underneath the coffee pot burner/heater. Spills tend to wash over the supposedly water proof buttons. All in all, a poor design and it was twice it's current price when it came out. I suppose Cuisinart would replace this machine also... but it's not worth the bother."
4,Cuisinart 10-cup Automatic Grind & Brew,"Love the quality and taste of the fresh brewed coffee; the auto-timer (waking to the fresh aroma of coffee) and the automatic shut-off (time determined by owner). Not so crazy about clean-up after every use. Because of the fresh ground beans; clean-up tends to be a bit of a mess, but in the overall picture, would probably still buy it."
1,Sounds like a helicopter!,"I returned this machine after using it twice. It is a horror to clean, and so noisy that it woke my daughter (who sleeps on the second floor) both times I used it."
1,DGB-300 Makes burnt tasting coffee,"I received the DGB-300 as a Christmas present. It is a nice lookig product, but makes burnt tasting and smelling coffee. I have tried beans and pre-ground coffees but get the same results. The coffee smells like burnt resistors or burnt plastic. I have cleaned it thoroughly with vinegar and water and washed the removble parts in the dishwasher. After 8 days of trials, I am giving up and returning it."
4,Not bad for a coffee pot,"The biggest problem was the instruction manual which would be better if it emphasized how to use rather than the warnings and multiple languages. It did take my wife three days to finally master it but it has quickly become a part of our ""start of day."" One apparently good feature I didn't see mentioned is the fact that the unit lets water by-pass the coffee to avoid the ""bitter ends."" I wondered how efficient the machine would be from the standpoint of transferring the coffee from the grinder to the filter area (you don't have to use the metal filter--paper works just fine--actually, most of the grounds do make it to the basket area. You do have to accept the fact that the parts have to be rinsed before the sink or dishwasher--it is a little messy but the coffee tastes better than that from our older non-grind models."
2,Owned it now for 2 years and it died...,"Up until now it's been a good coffee maker. Some gripes:1) It needs some type of ""reset"" button when you close it up w/out all the parts, hit a button by mistake, and it starts beeping at you. If you're not ready to make coffee at that time, you literally have to unplug it, which resets the clock, and timers, etc.2) The lettering on the controls has come off, and we haven't done excessive wiping on it, so that seems a bit cheap.3) I'm on my 3rd carafe - they break very easily and are sensitive to temperature, more that other coffee makers that I have had4) Yes, the grinding is loud, but who cares - it's the price you pay for good tasting coffee5) And finally - After two years IT DIED YESTERDAY. The display went blank. I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and the clock on the display blinked for about 5 seconds and then off again. Hopefully Cuisinart will honor the warranty"
4,Coffee - strong and not too acidic = GREAT COFFEE,"I got this coffee maker at a great price from Amazon so I wasn't too optimistic that it would live up to its billing. However I have been surprised that it is even better than it was advertised. As one reviewer also noted, my gold filter was missing as well. I contacted Amazon and they said I should contact Cuisinart first to see if they would send me one. One email sent to Cuisinart at their website produced a gold filter (gratis) at my front door in 10 days. All in all, a great buying experience. I may buy a spare to keep on hand for when this one gets old and ornery."
1,What a waste!,"We purchased the Cuisinart about 3 years ago and it has been nothing but trouble. The coffee pot always leaks when you try to pour the coffee into a cup, the clear plastic in the lid has splintered and the grid off button does not work anymore. The grinder runs whether you want it to or not. How annoying at 5:00 a.m. We are now searching for another grind and brew coffeemaker and I guarantee that it will not be of the Cuisinart brand. Hopefully these reviews will make people realize not to waste their money on this piece of machine!"
3,Great coffee maker....for about one year!,"When I initially received my Cuisinart DGB-300, I was impressed with the machine, so much so, that I brewed twice a day! The temperature control was fabulous, the coffee tasted great! It also brewed an entire carafe in half the time of conventional coffemakers. However, after 13 months, the machine went KAPOOT! I was very upset, especially when it stopped working AFTER the warranty ran out. I don't want to take any more chances with Cuisinart, so I will switch to Melitta."
1,"Egads, man, what were they thinking?","This isn't a coffee maker. It's a heinous, ungainly beast of an appliance that rewards an unprecedented amount of effort with weak and inconsistent coffee. Apparently no one who made this thing has ever made coffee before. The steam from the coffee gets into the grinder, making a muddy mess that makes each subsequent pot ranker. The many pieces, all of which you have to remove to make a simple batch, go back together like an IQ test. At 8 a.m., I DO NOT NEED AN IQ TEST. I NEED COFFEE.If you really want a grinder-brew pot, spend the extra for the nicely designed (but still complex) Capresso model. But until this technology advances a few more generations, I'm sticking with two seperate and blissfully simple units.Happy brewing."
2,I am not satified with it,"In general its a good coffee pot but mine has had a problem with the grinder and I am unhappy that I couldn't get a new one. they wanted me to ship this thing back then I wouldn't have no pot at all this one does give me some ground coffee. I paid 179.00 for this pot new, I would never do it again I had to buy a new pot and I don't like the features near as well."
3,"Some problems, some tricks to help","Yes, it makes weak coffee, but it possible make is better, Just make a full pot but set the knob under the lid to ""off"", which prevents water from bypassing the grounds.We've had two coffee pot lids fail after only days or weeks of use. There's something wrong with the plastic there. Not critical, but annoying.On the subject of noise, Not too bad, just don't have a cat on your lap when it starts.Would I buy another? I like the features but probably not."
3,Coffee maker for the coffee purist,"A rather complex kitchen gadget. I recommend it only for the purist who wants very good coffee. The machine creates quite a mess inside its case between the dust of the ground coffee and the steam from brewing. It takes patience to clean it thoroughly, but that patience is rewarded with excellent coffee.Our first machine failed after a few months. A fire started in the base. Thank goodness it was sitting on a tile counter top. Cuisinart replaced it with little fuss, though we had to negotiate shipping charges."
4,Happy brewing,"Although this machine is a pain to clean, and must be cleaned between each usage, it still is one of my favorite appliances. I've had this coffeemaker for about 2 years with no problems under daily usage. I recommend it to anyone with one caveat, and therefore only 4 stars--you have to hose the thing out every day. Oh--and get paper filters-one less thing to clean, and no grounds in your teeth."
4,Living with the DGB-300,"We have had a DGC-300 for over eight months and it is used daily. We have encountered no problems with the machine, with the exception of coffee stains on the carafe lid. We wash the innards each morning before leaving for work so that it will be dry when we load it that evening. While loud, the grinder is not as loud as handheld grinders and other pots. The coffee it make is good and is bean-dependent for quality. If we were to break the carafe, we would replace it with one with a black top."
2,Space eater then died,"I fit into the group of people who think that this thing is a major pain to clean. Actually cleaning all of the removable pieces isn't that bad, but the grounds get all over the inside of the machine along with brown coffee goo, so you have to wipe everything down inside, turn the machine over, and shake out the grounds. Plus, the machine is gigantic. Look at the picture and the ratio of machine to pot. That's a lot of counter space for a pot of coffee. Finally, it died after only a couple of years of use. You plug it in but nothing happens - the clock doesn't flash, none of the buttons work, nothing. It's a goner. Now I just have to find a place that will accept it for its parts because I feel so bad throwing such a huge appliance into the landfill. I have to admit, though, the coffee was pretty darn good while it lasted."
4,Luxury!!!,"I finally sucumbed and bought this new coffee maker. My idea of great coffee is hitting the gas station in the morning. I just did not want to be bothered with all of the hassle.I am very happy though that I did make this purchase! Every morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of freshly ground coffee. Tasty and piping hot to boot.With this Cuisinart, you can set the timer to make coffee, grind (or not), adjust the strength and not worry if you forgot to turn it off (it worries for you). A little red ball even indicates water loss due to steam. Oh and you can even set the temperature.Apparently there is even a self clean function but you still have to wash the parts out. This was my only complaint since there are more than a few pieces. Despite that small part of housekeeping, I am quite pleased."
2,Cuisinart Grind and Brew: Shop around,"I have had my coffee maker about a year. The Cuisinart folks have been helpful in replacing a part that I broke. The machine initally made coffee that had a very plastic like taste to it. The taste started to disappear after about a month and running vinegar and water through it. (The Cuisinart people are aware of this problem and asked me how I got the taste out.) Then the heater plate died, and then the right side of the control panel. It will brew and grind right now and that is about it. I am using it for the next few days until my new one from another manufacturer arrives. The coffee is not very good either! I don't mind the clean up. LM"
3,"good coffee, bad cleaning/design","The coffee is great! Cleaning is a pain!Biggest weakness is design...top lid of coffemaker needed replacement.Carafe design leaves a lot to be desired. See reviews for carafe itself. Lids ""nibs"" break off and handles break"
1,"Messy, messy, messy!","Coffee quality and flavor is fine, but the coffee grinds get all over the machine. I have a friend who has one, also...and has the same complaint. I have only had mine a few months and I'm buying a replacement from a different manufacturer. I generally hold Cuisinart in high regard, so this was a disappointment."
2,didn't make life easier,"I thought it would be great to have the grinder/coffee maker in one. It was a pain to clean, couln't make more then 1 pot with out going through a process. Coffee grounds everywhere, and one by one something went. the clock, timer then it wouldn't turn off.(I only had it 8 months) it finally died, won't brew anything(I'm thrilled to get rid of it). Looks nice though. Do yourself a favor, buy the grinder/coffee maker seperate."
4,Cuisinart auto grind review.,The coffee tastes wonderful. Less messy than grinding and transferring to a separate coffee maker. Requires cleaning after each use but that's easily done in a minute.
2,High Maintenance,"This machine makes great tasting coffee, but has many parts that have to be removed and at least rinsed after each use. I don't think integrating the grinder within the machine is such a good idea, since steam from the brewing process gets into the grinder, turning any leftover grounds in there into a thick paste that clings to the inside of the grinder. Also, the thin, plastic clip that holds the cover down broke on mine, forcing me to put something on top of the machine to keep it closed when I want to use it, since it will not work unless the cover is closed securely."
3,Decent,"I picked the coffee maker up at a steal at an electronics whole seller. It worked just as I wanted it to for some time. After about a year and a half of irregular grind use, I was forced to move to all pre-ground coffee for financial reasons. When I returned to the grinder again, it had stopped working. No warning, just will not work. The motor inside seems to sound like it is turned on, but the blades will not work.This, mixed with the fact that the thing is hard to clean (many spots inside the machine are impossible to touch) has left me with a bad taste in my mouth for the grind and brews."
4,combination coffee grinder/maker,Love this product! It makes a terrific cup of freshly ground and brewed coffee. It did take a little time to figure out how to use and how to clean - it has 3 parts which have to be removed and cleaned after each use - but now that I know how I love it. I would buy it again.
2,For the complusive cleaner,"I purchased this coffee maker thinking how convenient it would be to have my beans ground and coffee made with one touch of a button.While this appliance does deliver this convenience, it also demands meticulous clening with every pot brewed. The coffee grounds seem to get everywhere inside. Furthermore, there are just too many pieces to be cleraned.I would definitely not buy this coffee maker knowing what I know now."
2,Poor design!,Automatic Grind and Brew should be efficient and easy to clean - this is NOT! Wastes enough coffee for about 2/3 cup with each grind and creates a real mess if you stop it between grind and brew to clean. Special features just water down brewed coffee.
3,"OK, but quality problems","Bought one three years ago, the coffee tastes great but the grinder failed after 18 months. The company swapped it for a new one under the guarantee (although we were without for 3 weeks!). Now, again after 18 months use, the hotplate system has failed and no longer keeps the coffee warm. We'll probably buy another brand this time.It is necessary to wash various parts every day, which is a pain."
1,This Grind and Brew will Screw You,"This is an engineering monstrosity. You must spend 5-10 minutes cleaning it after every use. Otherwise, moisure inside the unit causes the grounds to start sticking everywhere, clogging the unit and making it inoperable. In cleaning, you may throw away 25% of the coffee you put in. When yo do clean it, grounds stick and smear on everything you touch, including wash cloths. If you forget to clean it (because you have to go to work) cleaning it the next morning is hopeless, since it goes back together damp, unless you thoroughly dry each component. Way more time, way more money and average coffee. Get a grinder and a press."
1,Reads like a first drafts from a mediocre mind,"It could have been a good book. At first sight names of the authors contributed to this festschrift were very attractive, but this was another book, which affirmed the reader that editing matters. This editor Aaron Son simply kills Earle Ellis twice with his incompetent work. From this book you may learn few things about history and exegesis of biblical studies, but for the price of the book you are better off with other preliminary essays- you just waste your money and time with Aaron's. I got this book for $10+ shipping on used; the copy I received was the one author himself gave to his colleague (friend), who reflected quite negatively on Aaron's dedication note and decided to sell it for $10. However, after all I do not even think it is worth $10. If you must check out the contents from the other review and read it off internet for free.T.K."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I purchased this hoping to make homemade french fries and sweet potato fries. I used it immediately but was slightly disappointed in how thin the potatoes came out. I was expecting the fries to be more like a crinkle cut thickness and this was more of a shoestring size. I personally feel the discs should be cheaper or more of them included in the original purchase of your Cuisinart as they are pricey. I have the 14 cup model and the discs are all very expensive, especially when you realize that they don't quite meet up to what you expected, therefore, you are less apt to use it. I would consider this more of a julienne cut rather than a french fry cut."
4,Good for skinny fries,This disc quickly whipped out shoestring fries. Works great. I'd also like to have a disc that made slightly larger fries too though.
5,14-Cup Cuisinart julienne disc,"Very useful add-on disc. Indispensable for zucchini, squash, carrots, and potatoes (hash browns). Works best if veggies cubed beforehand. Slices too small to make traditional french-fries, so ""French Fry Disc"" is a bit of a misnomer."
4,french fry lover,"I was very impressed by this product, FrenchFry Disc.My family and I love french fries and have them quite often, at least 3-4 times a week. I have artritis in my right thumb so slicing is sometimes painful. With this disc they are done in seconds. In fact my Grandson say to wait until he is here to cut them, He is amazed at the speed. The only drawback I see is I would like to see a bigger cut than 6mm.Also the time between ordering and recieving was fast and surprising."
1,Not for me,"I agree with other 1 and 2 Star ratings now ... I read all of the reviews first,but still had to find out for myself... Tried it on potatoes and other veggies (carrots and zucchini) for julienne cut, it just doesn't do a good job (too thin for french fries, and sort of rips other veggies, not smooth or straight cut. I wish someone would come up already with a good thin and medium julienne disk, at a reasonable price! I am still hopeful one day they will :-)"
1,Doesnt stay on the spindle,I had the same problem another user did. The blade will not stay on the spindle. I lock it in just the same as the other blades and even running dry it will come loose of the spindle. If you have it loaded when it comes loose watch out! the processor will jump off the counter. Very happy with my processor but beware this blade.
2,Not Satisfied,"I bought this French fry Disc for my 14-Cup Processor from Costco. The disc didn't fit the spindle properly. After every spin, it drops off from the spindle. I am adjusting them by opening the processor after every spin and putting it back. I am little worried whether I will damage my processor. I am trying to return this product with possible."
5,perfect for fries,"I use this disc for french fries for which it is perfect. It cuts 6x6mm obviously it is a julienne blade, so complaints from buyers who ""thought"" it would make bigger slices are ridiculous. It does exactly what is says and highly recommended for your cuisinart."
4,great folk pop italian artist,i beleve one of the great italian singer of the 60/s 70/s who is still performing a great pop voice exellent range especially her folk italian songs this cd shows her true contribation to italian pop
2,Bad design !,"The 2nd release mechanism is BENEATH the strap, so when you have a load strapped down its almost impossible to disengage 2nd trigger !!!! This is why i think the price is so low ! They GET YOU on the eye bolts though !!! 2 for well over $20.00... WHAT A RIP OFF !!!"
5,Excellent chips,Bought the box containing 12 packs and chips are not salty but just the right amount in them. Will buy again when find another great price.
4,Love these,I buy a case of these little gems every month. They are lightly salted (I have noticed the recent cases have seemed a bit saltier a trend I hope will not continue) and crunchy - so good for a snack on the go.
3,Chips are delicious but expensive,Chips are very delicious but very expensive. I buy this from another place for $1 a pack. It costs twice as much here.
1,Nasty,I thought these would be sweet but they are really salty. Very disappointed! You would think for them to be in the Paleo diet they would explain the taste more. Very bland!
3,Inka chips - the good and the bad,I tried these chips recently. The chips are cut thicker than Goya and other brands. I like Inka chips for the size of the cut and the fact that it is lightly salted. What I do not like is - the chips are over fried (brownish yellow)and it kills the taste.
1,Burnt oil taste,"I bought these at my local supermarket and I had to throw them away. You can feel a burnt oil taste, very disappointing."
4,"Good Taste, High in Fat","Love the taste of these chips, but I wish the fat content was lower!! I have heard mixed health benefits of palm olien. Not sure if there is a healthier roasted plantain snack chip alternative."
1,Didnt like these at all,They tasted like salty styrofoam and I ended up throwing them all out. I should have tried them before buying in bulk.
4,good closet rack,"The rack was about what I expected. Good shelves and adjustability, the wall anchors would have been fine if I had studs in different locations. I had to buy expandable metal wall anchors because I'm a bit of a wall anchor nazi. I don't like those plastic things that all wall kits come with."
4,Couldn't be easier to install,I doubled my closet space in less then 2.5 hours. The Closet kit was easy to install and I am thinking of ordering two more for my sons closets. I ordered this on a Friday afternoon and with free shipping I recieved the Closet kit Saturday morning. I was shocked to find it on my door step the next day. I would recommend the product to anybody who needs to organize their closet and not spend a bunch of money to do it.
5,great product,"exactly what i needed and super easy to install. i love this product, it adjusts easily to any space."
5,very practical,"I love these closets, are easy to assemble, clean and uses space well, and is something I love to suit one's needs. His appearance is pleasing to the eye."
4,Sturdy and easy to install system,"System was very easy to install. Only complaint is not enough anchors and screws included in kit. But overall looks very nice and did not take long to set up for 2 people. My advice would be to locate studs first and mark them before screwing in any of the parts. Also, it is helpful to have 2 people help instead of by yourself. Overall a great product, hardest part was deciding on which configuration I wanted! lol"
5,"Love it, very sturdy even in Drywall","My number one concern prior to buying this was that I am in new construction with metal beams; so I would be using the drywall anchors solely and I had a ton of clothes; my guess it probably something like 160 pounds of stuff total for the closet. Well after installation the whole system (even without going into studs) was very sturdy.I looked very closely at the Rubbermaid and Closetmaid systems and also looked at some of the custom closet solutions (Like elfa). I ended up going with the Rubbermaid and am very happy I did; the production value on the Rubbermaid top notch, very sturdy with good finishes, plenty of parts. Using the wall anchors I piled everything into a 4' closet with I would say about 95% utilization.I had a Closetmaid partical board system before and although it cost the same amount roughly... it wasn't configurable, had cheaper parts, worse clothes rod, and a cheaper less sturdy feel."
3,Gets the job done!,"The Classic Kit will definitely help organize and optimize your closet space. I've purchased 3 sets of Deluxe Kits prior to purchasing this one and there is definitely a difference in quality. The Deluxe Kit contains parts that are a bit more heavy duty. For an adult closet, I would definitely recommend the Deluxe Kit. For kids closets, the Classic Kit works out just fine. You just have to decide whether spending the extra $30-$50 is worth the upgrade. Don't get me wrong, the Classic Kit is not junk by any means. It's just a matter of how you expect to use the kit."
4,Excellent Product,"The Rubbermaid closet organizer is an excellent engineered product. It is very easy to install once you figure out what design you want.I did not follow completely the measurment shown in the manual. What I did is I did my own measurements.Couple dislikes:1- Make sure you have enough screws and you have all the required tools before you start putting the closet in. With my design I was short by one screw where I had to intterrupt my work and drive to Home depot.2- I wish I can buy spare shelves (variety of sizes) with a resonable price. If I need one more shelf, than I have to buy another kit with specific shelf sizes (depending to what comes in the kit). Home depot does carry Rubbermaid shelves but different model (look). The kits shelves are better.The closet now looks cleaner and well orgainized. If you need a closet organizer with a resonable price Rubbermaid is a good way to go."
5,Great Product--Great Price,"I bought 2 of these. One for each of my kids' closets. It definately made a HUGE difference and was very easy to install. I do, however, wish there were a couple more shelf options. Other than that, I have no complaints. I do have to say, though, that the wall anchors that come with it were like no other I had ever used and I couldn't figure them out (maybe just stupidity on my part, but I CAN'T be the only one ;] ), so it would be nice to offer some little instruction box on how to use the ones provided. Thankfully, I had some others on hand that were a no-brainer. Sturdy, lightweight, and a really great product."
4,Great budget option!,"My husband and father-in-law installed this system in two kids' closets in about 2 hours. In our old house, we used the Elfa system from the Container Store - it is very similar, but costs at least twice as much. For our needs, this Rubbermaid system will work great and the price is fabulous. Plus free shipping - what more could I want?"
4,Nice Price,"This is a very easy and simple project for any skill level. Once you level the main rail, everything is quick and easy put together. Only had to use two drywall anchors, everything else was attached the studs. It seemed a little flimsy until locked in, but it is very strong. Color is great and price was better than I hoped for, can't believe I saw the same kit in home stores for $150+. Only drawback is the Rubbermaid logo is kinda cheesy on the rail covers, don't need to see it every foot."
4,"Good, but not great","Installed this Rubbermaid system to add a lower bar to my closet to accomodate my girlfriend who's moving in. It's pretty easy to install. The anchors are not a problem if you read the directions and are actually quite good... I don't look forward to taking them out, if I ever have to. The shelves are sturdy and the standards provide plenty of configuration options. My only complaint is that the rods could be a little sturdier and be fastened to the shelves more securely. The metalic look is a nice change from the constant white rubber coatings on most closet systems. Overall, I'm pleased (but not in love)."
4,Would've been great...,"I ordered this for a closet. Unfortunately, concrete walls prevented me from actually putting it up. I would recommend otherwise. Fast shipping."
1,Dangerous Product,"Simply put, this product worked as advertised for about 11 months, before failing miserably. This failure caused damage to my home and personal property. The weight of the objects on the system caused it to be pulled out of the wall, sending metal parts flying everywhere. If someone had been in the room while the failure occurred, they would have been injured as well.Do not buy this product if you value your home or your safety."
1,Wrong items shipped!,"I waited well over a week to get my closets, I ordered 3 sets of the titanium 3-6 foot closet systems. I received 3 white sets, not a huge deal but now I'll have to keep them for fear that I'll have to wait another 10 days to get the wrong item again. Meanwhile my closets have been spread out across the house."
3,An English mystery with edge,"With its genteel descriptions of English manor houses and their surrounding lush countrysides and quaint villages, ""The Body of a Woman"" often feels like the kind of polite English mystery one can relax with without undue fear of excess tension. But be warned: the book involves a sexual crime that warrants a fair amount of frank discussion and investigations of several seedy and/or perverse characters. The police characters, however, are competent and likable, and provide a nice grounding for the often unpleasant proceedings. If you enjoy smart mysteries, you shouldn't hesitate spending a few hours with this entertaining paperback."
