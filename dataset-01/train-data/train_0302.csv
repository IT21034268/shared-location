2,Too many errors.....,I got about 200 pgs into the book when i realized the errors and blatant contradictions were adding up. I've counted at least 6 errors. Since when is DYSPHAGIA an impairment in speech due to a brain lesion????? i'm really pissed because i've wasted alot of time utilizing this book and now i'm not sure if i've read even more errors and just didn't catch them. Studying incorrect information is NOT conducive toward passing the NCLEX.
5,Good Service,"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! It was awesome, I cried my way all the way through it! It came fast and in great condition! THanks!"
3,The Story Evoked Emotions,"Jack and Molly Campbell are the adoptive parents of four-year-old Joey. They are a family that enjoys life, and life gets even better for Molly when her sister/best friend, Beth, moves to town with her husband and four children. But things take a turn for the worse for the Campbells when, Wendy and Rip Porter, Joey's biological parents, decide they want their son back.Most of the chapters in this book are lengthy; sometimes including way more information that I thought was necessary. However, the story did evoke emotions; especially when Joey had to visit his biological parents. I felt so bad for the child, but, just like Joey, I was also comforted by the truth that God was with him."
5,Great product,Received the book in a reasonable time frame. Have already read the book and loved it. Book was in great shape. Thanks a bunch.
2,"Pedictable, simple, unbelievable. Very religious.","I really couldn't stand this book. I don't know why I finished it. I read it in two days, it was a simple read. I wanted to find out what happened in the end. I was intrigued by the concept but the ending was a cop-out.I found the characters to be stereotypical, simplistic and unbelievable. Especially the boy Joey. Skip this one - or at least check your library before you buy!"
1,A heaping spoonful of sugar!,"Had I realized this was religious tract in disguise, I never would have bought it, however, once purchased I felt obliged to give it a fair chance. I couldn't get past the first few chapters. The characters were so saccharine I could feel my blood sugar levels rise with each sentence. There are too many excellent books out there waiting to be read to waste my time on this one."
2,Please don't get the audio version!!!!,"I am listening to the audio version of Like Dandelion Dust and it's truly horrible.The narrator is atleast 100 and he's talking in multiple voices (voices for women, a five year old, and a tough guy just getting out of prison)!I tried to get over the narration, but the story line is weak. I mean the concept is interesting but I feel like the author is just not pulling it off.When I read the back cover of the disc I was really excited, but upon listening I am really bored...I don't have a problem with the Christianity, the book just isn't that great."
3,Great idea,The book was so interesting to me and I enjoyed the story line. I really was troubled by the sister relationship and the sister's need to be so holy and turn her sister in. I really think this book could have been a 5 star if it wasn't so preachy and stuck more to the story line.
5,God's Grace,"I have yet to find a Karen Kingsbury book that I don't like and this one was great. Having considered adoption ourselves, it is definitely one the greatest walks of faith a family will ever take. This book helped me to remember that God is in control no matter what the circumstance and will work all things to our good and His glory."
2,obvious,"It is an obvious book, you can see where it is going right away.The little boy it the story the author tried to make him 'too cute"" with a the mispronounced words. The adoptedfamily and kid were too perfect"
5,Like Dandelion Dust,This was an interesting book. Karen Kingsbury writes sad things that happen to people but you want to finish her books to see what the outcome is. This book was made into a movie also. I'm not sure if it is better to see the movie first and then read the book or read the book and then see the movie. On a whole this was a well written but sad book.
5,"""The only remedy for love is to love more ""","This is Stendhal's analysis of Love. It was allegedly written because of his unrequited love for a woman named Methilde Dembowski. He analyzes in the work the kinds of Love , and the stages of Love. The work contains many aphorisms of great insight and beauty. For Stendhal one kind of Love the love he is afflicted with is a romantic love which is a kind of Madness. In the first part of the book he analyzes this kind of Love.In the second part of the book he analyzses different national types in relation to Love, finding the French lacking and the Italians more successful.This is a ' classic work' but in my reading of it it lacks the depth I sense is required to give a more convincing and comprehensive explanation of that Passion which makes us most human."
2,Don't bother,I ordered this because my puppy chewed the power cord to my cordless vtech phone base unit. It arrived quickly enouugh but would not fit into the hole because its too big. It was a waste of time and money and now I have to be inconvenienced with sending the junk back.
5,Wall Wart,The little Belkin wall wart dcpsu worked fine for my KVD switch. Expensive but best price around.
4,Some of the Best Classical Music Around,"This box set contains some of the best and most popular classical music. There is a variety of composers and the CDs all have different moods within - from sad and sinister, to airy and lively. I personally would suggest going and getting the ten CD set right away instead of just the five. It truly is some of the most enjoyable classical sets I've heard."
1,Daniel does it again...,"In another horrible work bythis third-rate historian, Daniel probes another trite labor issue. This work is a terrible read. Calling it murky and incoherent is a compliment. Thank you Cletus, for again adding nothing to our knowledge of the labor movement."
5,Literary adaptation par excellence.,"Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" is a literary adaptation par excellence, by a film maker at the peak of his powers. This beautifully envisioned film is drenched in authentic atmosphere, uniquely and unforgettably directed by Polanski, who takes the time to tell the story with great clarity. Nastassia Kinski's breakthrough performance is simply stunning. Easily the best ""costume drama"" of the last twenty years, and alongside ""Chinatown"", Polanski's best work to date."
3,Tess with a Polish accent,"Dishonored by her ersatz cousin , Tess has a child who dies. After some time she finds love while milking cows with an ""Angel"", but their marriage is spoiled by Tess telling the truth about her past.Bad comes to worse when her father dies and the family loses their tenantstatus on the farm.Comes to marry her rich cousin to keep a roof over her Mom and siblings,but when Angle returns sick from Brazil and searches out Tess,the end is not a happy one.I thought that although the staging, costuming and most of the actingwas well done, the lead was played believably."
3,Difficult Task,Compelling as the story is I would not try to condense it into a feature length movie. It is a good movie - I was frankly disappointed because Hardy's novel is much richer and makes the reasoning of the characters much more discernable. I would recommend anyone to read the novel and watch the movie as a light distraction. You will enjoy the movie more if you've never read the book.
4,Not Masterpiece Theater- but well done,"While taking artistic liberties from the novel , Polanski's Tess is a very entertaining and beautifully filmed movie. The settings and costuming recreate the feeling of Hardy's Wessex as well as any filmed version of his works ever has.Nastassja Kinski was beautiful in the role and although her acting can be somewhat wooden at times she does make a memorable Tess. The rest of the cast make up for her shortcoming by providing outstanding performances.The pace tends to slow in certain parts of the film but if you are a fan of period films loosely based on classics you can do worse than spending some time watching this."
2,A Disappointing Interpretation of an Important Literary Work,"The main problem I had with this dated film was motion. Overall, it was quite dull, and even plot elements from the book that kept my attention left me tired of the 3 hour film. I will admit that the movie followed the storyline of the book faithfully, however some key portions were left out. It could be said that reading Hardy's original novel is a prerequisite for viewing the film, because some of the movie could be quite confusing without knowledge of the book. One major redeeming quality that I noted was this: There was one important element that was retained between the book and the film, and that was how out-of-touch Victorian people seem to have been with their emotions. Many characters, Tess especially, seem quite passive, which, while it IS a period characteristic, works to dull the movie. In summation, this film is an accurate, but uninspiring rendition of a historically important piece of literature."
5,Haunting,"This brings Hardy's tragic heroine to life and there will never be another version to equal it. Polanski is a master with the camera. I have watched this maybe 50 times and still find it hard to believe this was filmed in Normandy, France rather than England!"
3,Not such a special edition,"Columbia's DVD of Tess is doubly disappointing - not only is it a disappointing transfer but it's also the cut version of the film, which tends to lose a little heart and more than a little irony. There's still much to admire, from the beautiful Scope cinematography and Phillipe Sarde's superb score to Polanski's feel for time and place (even if it is shot in France rather than Wessex) and, ironically, sexual prejudice, although Nastassja Kinski never really convinces in the lead and Leigh Lawson's despoiling cad seems constantly on the verge of twirling his moustache. The murder still seems a plot contrivance, although it does throw in one great moment of vintage Polanski with a spot of blood on the ceiling.Still, at least the 72-minute documentary is very good."
4,Supurb practical text,"I'll keep it brief. I've bought this book already a long time ago. And now and then still delve into it. Like many have said bfore me,it's exactly what the title says it is. A practical intro with plenty of readable source.If people think the theory side is a bit light,they're ofcourse right, but that is exactly what the author intended to do.This book delivers on what it promises,no more no less.You can actually get to work after reading it ;)I would for instance recommend ""Bishop, Neural networks for pattern recognition"" to get a more solid foundation,(which admittedly is not a bad idea). All in all worth every penny/dollar/euro."
5,The Only Honest Memoir You'll Ever Find About The Ten,"This book is a much needed contribution to the historical record, to undo all the mindless junk that's been said for years about what the Hollywood Ten was all about. Dmytryk's memoir is candid, honest and gets to what the heart of the matter was all about. And because he was the only one of the Ten who recognized that, he is treated now as a pariah by those who seem to think that fealty to the American Communist Party is more noble than ""naming names"", even when in Dmytryk's case it forced him into prison in the name of beliefs he no longer held.Probably the best memoir of one man's break from American communism since Whittaker Chambers's masterpiece ""Witness."""
2,Great theme story but poorly developed.,"I personally wasn't impressed with this movie. It's okay if you're a big fan of football cause most of the filming is of the game. The theme of the story is great; paralyzed football player dedicates his time coaching juvenile kids. However, the story lacks flow and the ideas aren't well developed."
3,feel good movie,"both you could really tell that this movie is decades old ...not just the clothing and such, but the 'bad kids turn good' feel good movie that was so prevalent in 70's and 80's... robert conrad was his usual hardcore self, this time in a wheelchair."
1,Coach of the Year,"This movie was out-of-date when it was produce in 1980. It reeks of the politically correctness movement of the Psyco- sixties & seventies. Even out of the bargain bin, this was no bargain."
2,"Excellent as always, but...","Everyone who knows John Hammond's music knows that he only does covers of famous blues standards and his singing, harmonica and guitar playing are always excellent-those are known quantities, and this re-release of a 60's album is no exception. But prospective buyers should know that there is only 29 minutes of music here. So, if you're new to John's music, you should consider his Greatest Hits instead which has over 70 minutes of blues covers. But if you're a collector, you'll buy this no matter what."
2,Incense & Thunder,"This book blessed me. If you have a prodigal child, read chapter 13, it will inspire and give you comfort and confidence in God's promises."
1,Not worth it,"We are new to the gluten-free world but found this bread unexceptable. Less than 1 star, but that was not an option. Whether fresh, toasted or grilled it was dry, crumbly, had an odor and strange after taste. After more checking we found ""Sami"" millet & flax seed bread. You have to toast or grill it, but it is FANTASTIC. We are enjoying toast with breakfast and toasted or grilled sandwiches again. So don't bother with the Ener-G look for Sami"
4,"Wheat-free, Gluten-free Bread","Good option for a WF/GF diet, but texture is dry, so it crumbles easily. My son prefers to eat it toasted, which helps make the texture more like regular bread containing wheat."
1,Buy to make croutons or bread crumbs....,"Being recently diagnoised with celiac and being a bread lover, I am constantly trying out the gluten free breads. This loaf bread was a major disappointment. Its very heavy and not suitable for sandwiches. It was just okay for toast. I ended up making croutons and bread crumbs out of the remaining loafs. I'm still looking for a great loaf of gluten free bread..."
5,Good Mouse Pad,"I am so use to having a wrist pad, I can't use mouse any extended periods of time without it. This one is pretty decent, good support and affordable price. It is a dark midnight blue"
1,too short,"only .5"" high not 1.5""fabric is not durable, wears through and hard to keep cleanother than obvious lack of function due to height, no leaks, does not stiffen up over timeInnovera is a better brand"
2,Not happy with the product.,The wrist rest part seems to have deflated a bit. I have to use it cockeyed where there is still adequate gel in the wrist support. It is comfortable... but I wish I had either gotten a different one or that this one was not a dud. Move on to the next choice.... this one is a FAIL.
3,To Flat,I did not like the feel of the pad because it is uncomfortable period and does no good for your wrist.
5,Inspirational Vocals,This CD displays all the genuine feeling and musicianship to be found on the later Phenomenal Woman CD. What an incredible talent not to have been widely celebrated in larger and larger circles these past years.Ruthie's rendition of Joy on the last track leaves one yearning for Heaven. Not to be missed!
5,Incredible talent!,"I bought this CD after seeing Ms. Foster on Austin City Limits. Correction, I bought this CD while she was performing. I don't by CD's on a whim, but she is incredible. I'm not a music reviewer, so no need to pretend. All I can tell you is that I can't wait to get my hands on everything she's ever done! She absolutely blows me away."
5,Exceptional Artist-Outstanding CD,"The music on this CD is moving...emotionally, energetically, compositionally, and humanly. Ruthie Foster's delivery is magnificent and so well complemented by Cyd's rhythm and accompanying vocals. After I first experienced Ruthie perform (she was with Bo Didley in MD) her music was with me and in my soul. She is a treasure. Listening to, or singing along with Ruthie can make your day. Also check out her CD, ""Stages"" - standout performances by Ruthie and Cyd."
4,A Romantic Tonic,"Smooth as melted chocolate whipped into cream--and just as rich. A lucious CD can set the perfect background for that ""special"" romantic evening. Gently handled saxaphone with just enough ensemble to back it up. Soft. Melts in your ears, melts your cares & worries away. But it doesn't melt everything ..."
5,Out of this world!,"My wife and I agree that a spear in the hand is worth a lot.This book was full of surprises and adventure. Most importantly though, the more I read, the more I wanted to read.Like all of Dave Snow's novels this book has a nice blend of how ordinary characters prove to excel in extraordinary circumstances.On top of all that, who wouldn't want to fly around in an old Camro, and take a second shot at childhood with a few close friends?"
4,shipped fast,worth the money because they will last forever and I won't have to keep buying toys just to throw them away after five minutes. Happy chewing!
3,Puppy loved it but...,It was destroyed in two sittings. Shes just a 20lb lab but I had to take it away before she tore a hunk off the end. Too bad cause she really seemed to like it.
5,West Paw Small Zogoflex Dog toy,"This is a great dog toy for medium to small dogs. Color makes it easy to find.Floats as stated. And if you have a dog that loves to crew, this is your bone- indestructable."
4,It's Sturdy,"I think it's a fine toy ... seems sturdy and is certainly ""tough,"" but my little dog doesn't seem to like it. She's tiny (8 pounds) Shizu mix, and I think it's just too heavy for her to like it much. Not the fault of the toy, I don't think, but maybe better for doggies who are a little bigger."
3,God Only Knows...,"Excellent momentary entertainment. The ""God Only Knows"" sequence is beautiful and entertaining. I've been listening to the Beach Boys ever since this film came out on TV."
3,"""The Beach Boys: An American Family"" is a lot better","I feel that this movie was not as good as ""An American Family"". Bruce Greenwood, although a good actor and good Dennis Wilson, did not have any resemblence to Dennis, whereas Nick Stabile did. I feel it does the movie better if the actor portraying someone resembles them a little bit, (I understand that may be hard to find but when you do the movie is better(: )It's been a while since i've seen either of these movies but I definately feel ""An American Family"" is a lot better. This movie is good, too, but if you a Dennis Wilson fan, then i would consider seeing ""An American Family"" b/c Nick Stabile portrays Dennis really well. Actually, I recommend seeing both so you can compare and decide for yourself. ***FOREWARNING: ""An American Family"" is really hard to find at a reasonable price***"
1,Fire Hazard!,"After 2 months of use, the fan stopped turning in this heater. This caused the heater coils to turn bright red and overheat. It started smoking profusely. My circuit breaker did NOT trip, nor did any fuses within the heater unit cut off. Luckily, I just happened to be nearby and smell the smoke. Another few minutes and my house would have likely burnt down. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB for this Lakewood product."
1,"good heat, poor longevity",I bought this last year. It lasted 3 months. It worked well while it worked. The store no longer carried it when I went for an exchange. I figure I paid $6/mo. for heat. That's fair enough.
1,"Bought it got zapped, brought it back!",I bought this heater at Walmart for 12.99 pluged it in grabed it at the top to hold it while i turned it on and got a nice long jolt..... Needless to say its back at the store. The Lady behind the counter didn't beleave me dispite my plea and well now she does. Not a good buy..
3,Adequate reference guide,"We got into the SF preschool game late and, in my desperation, I bought this book and read it cover to cover. It gives a nice summary of each school that responded to the authors' request for information and it was one of the few resources I've found that includes information on public preschools in the city. I would not recommend that parents use this as their sole guide in finding a preschool - check out savvysource.com, ParentsPlace's ""Choosing a Preschool"" class or preschool information night, or ""Babies By the Bay"" for more information - but it's a good starting point and I was happy to pass my copy along to a friend. (Our preschool search had a happy ending: we applied to three schools and got offered spots in two - one of which was our top choice. Good luck to you, too!)"
4,See The General as he was,"I have always regarded General Patton as one of the greatest warriors in the twentieth century. This book confirms my admiration. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and learned a great deal about the general. If you are interested in finding out the truth, read this book. Blumenson does a good job portraying his career. It's an entertaining read and you won't be bored with the narrative."
3,An American Legend,"While not the definitive word on Patton, Blumenson's work is probably the best short biography on one of the most complex figures of American military history. I recommend reading it in conjunction with the newer and more comprehensive PATTON; A GENIUS FOR WAR by Carlo D'Este; after which you can graduate to Blumenson's two volume editings of THE PATTON PAPERS, 1885-1940 & 1940-1945. As a staff weinie, I also enjoyed BG Oscar Koch's interesting G-2: INTELLIGENCE FOR PATTON. Koch was perhaps the best G-2 in the ETO during WWII. Patton's urbane and erudite aide, COL Charles Codman, also produced a delightful memoir, DRIVE, which though OOP is available on the Net."
3,Billy Bones,"This EP from Australian singer songwriter Mandy Kane is his second release since signing to a major label. Based on the fictional character Billy Bones, this concept EP is an interesting look into the creative process Mandy undertakes. The title track is a heavily riff based homage to blowing things up, an anthem for teenage rebellion in some ways, telling the story of pyrotechnic genius Billy Bones. The EP also has some notable b-sides including the live favourite Mayday and an acoustic version of his first hit single Stab. All in all it is worth the price and despite being flawed it is a good indication of what is yet to come from this talented young man."
3,Judith Triumphans Review of the CD,Unfortunately only the second cd works and it is good. The first cd is defective so I can't really fully review the item
3,fits my saturn,fits my saturn but no way to attach the cable so that i wont forget it in the gas station when filling.
5,"This was a great show, and this is a beautiful catalog","OK, in full disclosure, I was in this show, and very proud of it, but also, I think it is an important book for your reference shelf. AFter all, everyone has something bad or controversial to say about the biennials, so lets skip that, and focus on the fact that a book like this, or other museum catalogs serve to give the reader a good sense of a particular slice of art history at any given time. Even if that history is slanted, biased, etc., you still get to see art work that is good."
3,Somewhat lacking,"(referring to the entire collection)The collection is well designed for introducing the listener to a large variety of music, with its broad range of composers and types of music. However, the interpretation of the music is hardly existant, and many of the pieces sound rather dull and uninteresting. Some lively pieces are played too slowly, and nearly all of them without emotion, keeping the set out of reach from being included in a true classical collection. Despite all that, the sheer number and range of pieces (along with the low price) make this a collection well suited for the new classical listener."
3,"Great collections, with poor quality sound","I expected to listen to great professional classical orchestra ...for this classical music collection, but the quality of the music is not too good.There are a lot of great music collections, but they will sound better when they record it right.It is good when you just want to have more classical music, but for a CD, the sound quality is like a [poorley made] CD.I give 3 stars for this product."
4,Great for kids,"This story is about a different time and a different place. A family whose father is away are on an idyllic holiday in the Lake District for two weeks and the group of children are allowed to spend all of it camping on an island and sailing. They pretend to be grownups and meet another couple of kids who are pretending to be pirates. Reading this now as an adult was enjoyable enough for me to know I would have loved it when I was a kid. The book made me feel a bit sad in that I don't think this world exists anymore though perhaps it could if kids had the right parents. There's no TV, no personal hi-fi's with their sexual innuendo-filled songs etc. It also shows that kids can, with a little help from the parents, get by for long periods on their own. I don't think parents would allow this nowadays but maybe I'm wrong. A fun read, I'd advise you to get it for your kids then go camping!"
5,Wonderful and very funny,"This is a must for any personal library. The antics and mischief these six children get up to is hilarious. For instance, when Nancy and Peggy threw the lit Roman candle into the asleep Captian Flint's cabin window but showed no remorse. Everyone should read this book!"
5,A Great Sailing Adventure Book,"For everyone, who, like me, is always confused where in the series a specific book fits in, this book is the first in the series of Swallows and Amazons. It is a fantastic book about four children who camp on an island in a lake in England. They soon meet two girls who own a sailing dinghy and consider themselves to be pirates. The book is filled with sailing, and adventure, and takes place in the 1940s(I think). Since sailing technology has changed since then this makes the book interesting to read for people who have sailed before or are interested in it. I wold reccomend this book to everyone. The whole series is great and you should read them all."
2,Difficult to get into ...,"We selected this book as a read-aloud. We tried and tried, but just couldn't get into it. The vocabulary is VERY sophisticated, quaint, and old-fashioned. Also, it's hard to understand all the sailing terminology. It has sentences like this: ""Is there a cleat under the thwart where the mast is stepped?"" Who talks like that???"
1,A Lot Lacking,"To me there's a lot missing in this book:physical description of the characters (not even the color of their hair)characters don't seem like identifiable peopleit's not clear why the crew of the Swallow wants to spend their vacation on an uninhabited islandor why the crews of the two boats immediately start out as foesfrom their actions, the two woman crew of the Amazon need psychiatric helpIn sum, don't waste your money on this or its companion book (as I did).If you'd like to see how these books should be written, read any of Elizabeth Enright's works."
5,sailing in wild waters (well almost),"I read this book to my younger sister, she didn't think much of it, but I loved. This is about 4 children who decide to spend the summer on an island. They are sure it will go perfectly until they find that a ""pirate"" is living next to them and some one has all ready been to their island. The story is not about great adventurers, but about children pretending. They pretend so well sometimes that I forget they are just staying on an island not a days journey away from home. I would not recomend this book to any one wo gets bored and doses off if every chapter doesn't have adventure (like my sister), but if you can stand the first part which is pretty long then you should read this book."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"My brother(8) and I(12) have read all of the books in the series. Every summer, we go to Maine and become Titty and Roger. My mother is Susan, and my father is John. We even have our own Swallow. Our cat also has a job--Sinbad. In Maine, we live on Moosehead Lake, and so we are able to relive a different book each summer."

3,too much range for quiet listenig,"I had intended this album to cover up background noise and create a restful environment. However, the selections and the interpretations are not suitable for that, they range from a whisper to a blast."
2,better live act then on record,"what makes this duo good is the simplicity of the set up...drums and keyboards. This is a band that attracts musicians more than casual listeners.""Becky"" is the best track.I saw them live and they were more interesting then good. The music is more background music, with a tribal sound, then anything else.What makes them interesting and different also gives them limitations. There is only so much you can do with this set up. Ask Medeski, Martin and Wood...which blows this band away."
3,Pondovac 3,Pondovac works fine as described however my pond to large for thisvacuum. Ponds deeper than 3' not to effective. Small ponds itwould be great.
4,Entertainment + Good Recipes,"Yes, I was back at the library again and found this little gem for sale. I bought it without even looking at it, planning to give it to a friend who is a Lucy fanatic. Well, after opening it up, looking at the great pictures and finding some really tasty sounding recipes like ""Dominic's Chicken and Rice Empanadas"", ""Cousin Ernie's Country Fried Chicken"" and ""Mrs. McGillicuddy's Rice & Red Bean Salad"", I have decided it's proper place is on my cookbook shelf! This is an entertaining little book, glad I stumbled upon it!"
4,Huge Lucy fan,"this has the best things in it and everything is lucy tymed, which if your a fan of the show u know that the recipes are a little out there..the book a huge boon for any fan"
5,I Love Lucy Cookbook,I got the I love lucky cookbook yesterday! I love it!! The book was in great condition. It has some very yummy Receipe's in it! If your thinking about getting this and are not certain be sure to order it....it will not disappoint you.
3,It's nostalgic -- with or without the food...,"This cookbook is a must have for all those ""I Love Lucy"" fans out there. The recipies are fine, if a bit predictable. Of course, that doesn't matter, 'cause it's got great memories of all your favorite characters all wrapped up inside and that's the real gem!"
4,Seems to work fine,"I just received this item a couple of hours ago, but so far it seems to work just fine. I only have memory stick and smartmedia media so I can't vouch for the other media types, but the adapter was able to read them just fine. My Windows 2000 laptop didn't require any new drivers and the adapter doesn't come with any. Having one card to read both media I use will be very convenient and it costs basically the same as a single media type adapter. The only tradeoff is that my smartmedia only adapter comes with an eject button and the 4 in 1 doesn't - you have to eject the adapter to be able to remove the media, but given the different form factor media it accepts, an eject button would probably have been a minor miracle of engineering. As long as this adapter keeps working like it does now, I'm happy with it."
5,SUPER EXCITED.,"I honestly am super excited for this movie to come out. All the other Eating Out Titles have been really good, and the description seems to be intriguing. :)"
4,This was fun,"I thought it was a nice story, with some hot guys, and I'm glad it ended the way it did."
3,It was Ok,"when watching these kind of movies i like seeing little more nudity and more open showing acual getting it on ,doing each other"
2,Another Eating Out movie,I have enjoyed the first 2 Eating Out movies very much.This one was pretty lame to say the least.Great looking guys but even for a campy comedy this one was pretty bad.
5,Hilariously embarrasssing.,Funny and cute just like the other 4 even though nothing tops the original. Whether or not the acting is good its still a good see movie.
2,Probably the worst in the series,"Really disappointing. I suppose it tried to say something relevant about gay marriage, but it seemed forced. Rebekah Kochan is in it for about 5 seconds and made even less sense than her appearance in Drama Camp. Bring her back!!!"
4,Enjoyable Like the other Eating Out Films,"What can I say, I am hooked on the Eating out movies. I find them funny with a great cast of characters and this film carries on the tradition. It's amazing how a group of people get into such fixes, but in the end it all seems to work out. I know it's the movies but it was a good one with many laughs. Enjoy with a friend and some popcorn!"
5,OMG LOVED IT!!!!!!!,I LOVE THE EATING OUT FRANCHISE.. I HOPE THERE IS MORE OF THESE. THESE MOVIES GIVE YOU HOPE ABOUT LOVE
2,wish they would stop.,"This series has been beat to death. Just let it go guys...move onto something worthy of your talents. On the flip side, at this point some of the actors are actually improving. So, it's been worthwhile for a few careers perhaps. I suspect if they got hold of a fresh new script things would be awesome. This particular edition had a few slapstick (no pun) moments, but the script was poorly written. Just not worth the time and effort that obviously went into filming it. Sorry guys. Move onto something new. Stop wasting your time on this story line."
2,A light gay movie,"A bunch of beautiful guys, lots of muscle and skin showing, and few jokes here and there. Not a great story or acting. Entertaining to an extent."
4,Simple review,"This is better than average production with a rather minimalist storyline. It gives social support for others to see minority people. It is not a sophisticated work, but is comedic.David Kazm"
1,Eating out is dreadful,"This had no redeeming value for me what so ever. Good luck finding it for anyone else out there., it ain't secxy that's for sure. a bit fo eye candy at very best."
4,Not As Good As The Others,"Eating Out: The Open Weekend is the fifth in the Eating Out series, and while it's an entertaining film in its own right, it is a cut below from previous entries. It isn't as funny as Eating Out 2, 3, and 4, and that probably has something to do with Mink Stole and Rebbekah Kochan being reduced to cameos. Kochan also was only in one scene in Eating Out: Drama Camp. I don't know why this is, since the Eating Out movies are probably the most popular that she has appeared in. And both her and the writers and directors of these movies surely know what a fan base she and her character of Tiffani have. Still, Eating Out: The Open Weekend is pretty fun in fits and starts and worth seeing. But it isn't as consistantly hilarious as past outings."
4,delightful,"This is a charming story about the Middle Ages. It portrays the life of a young boy in a fairly well to do merchant family. We are given insights into such diverse subjects as arranged marriages and the catching of fleas. The style is simple and clear and the characters are believable. If the plot is not fast and thunderous, it is still interesting. Well worth reading."
1,This book is messed up.,"THe only good thing about this book is that there is action. That is the only good thing. THE subjects that this book shows is extremely terrible. I mean, this guy likes to weave. Get real. Never read this book!"
1,Not WideScreen as Advertised,These are two very good westerns. One with John Wayne and James Stewart and the other Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur in her last film. The problem is the films are not in wide screen as advertised. Don't pay more as I did hoping to get what you paid for.
4,Shane & The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance DVD,Two great movies and well worth the price. They are not blueray but the quality isn't bad. I think they were well worth the price.KenWebmaster[...]
2,Not as great as they made it sound...,"The Vornado 783B looks nice and has some power to it; however, it's not ""whisper quiet"" as advertised. It's about as quiet as any other fan when it's on the lowest speed; but it gets louder as you get to medium and REALLY loud (can't use it if I'm trying to talk to someone in the same room) on high speed. Also, it's not very well balanced: it's quite easy to tip over forward... my dog can bump into it and knock it down.It's ok, but definitely NOT worth the $100 I paid for it. I could have spent $25 at Wal-Mart to get something quieter that has oscillation."
4,Vornado fan,"This fan is very effective. I have a loft like bedroom office area over the living kitchen area -- quite large. My bi-level heating systems in both areas are effective, but there tend to be big gaps for some time if I turn them on on a cold morning or a hot afternoon. The Vornado fan quickly equalizes the temperature on both levels in all corners by moving a huge volume of air easily and comfortably around. I am sure it also makes the bi-levels more efficient and economical as a result.I had a 30 year old similar fan which wore out. It was more quiet than the new Vornado which is fairly quiet on low, very tolerable on medium, but a bit noisy on full."
3,The lack of a variable fan speed is a deal-breaker.,"I bought this fan as a Christmas gift. At first my friends were impressed but when we set up the fan to distribute the air from the heating furnace the Vornado created an unpleasant draft even on the lowest speed. They thought the fan would be better suited for the summer and out to the garage it went. The 3-speed switch is a disappointment... a fan this expensive should have a continuously variable speed control. It would be much more versatile. Too bad, I was thinking of buying one for myself but I no longer think it's worth it."
4,Uber great fan,I bought this fan to move air around in my stale aired valley apartment and its does that fantastically. It's surprisingly quiet for such a large fan and it not completely hideous like that box fan full of dust in your window. On dust; the cover comes off quick and easy allowing access to clean it swiftly and thoroughly. My biggest and only complaint about this fan is the base. Sure the base looks nice but if you are a bit off your wagon and bump into it just a little it tends to wobble and fall over if you are not quick on your feet to catch it. That said move it out of a high traffic area and you will be good to go.
3,Vornado 783B,This fan is not as versitle nor quiet as the variable speed version it replaced. It seems to be made 'cheaper' and the lowest speed is not very quiet. We used to run the old version at the lowest speed for just 'gentle' air circlulation. You can't run this one in that mode. Very dissappointed.
4,Something smells in here....,"The power of this fan is great, the design is great, I really like how high it is off the ground. It will keep you cool. But when I got mine it stunk. For weeks it stunk. It had a burning plastic or maybe some kind of burning lubricant smell after it had been running for awhile. It was really bad and really annoying considering I paid a hundred bucks for a smelly fan. I was so ticked off I put the fan out on the back porch with my dogs and left it running on high for a week straight. I was just going to leave it outside but I thought I would check and see if the smell had finally worn off and it had. So now the fan is back in my workout room where it belongs and it no longer smells like its burning. Maybe I just got a overly lubed fan or something because I didn't see anyone else mention this problem. So anyway its a really great fan but if yours stinks put it outside for a week or so and it should be fine."
4,I like fans a lot!,"I bought this one in Florida after my cheap chinese made lakewood HV fan bit the dust.I got this at Sprawl mart for $64 clearance price and assembled it in no time.The fan, aka air circulator, does blow up a storm but is fairly quiet on low speed. I am not overly impressed with the excessive use of plastic but at least it is not cheap plastic that you see on other big box store type fans.The motor is a PSC 4 pole unit with sleeve-type bearings. They are non lubricating and I am not a big fan (no pun intended). SuperElectric LTD of Hong Kong supplies this chinese made motor.Fan is 3 speeds and all are decidedly different."
3,Missing parts upon receiving goods.,Everything was OK except for the 4nos.missing rubber rings used for the Vornado 783 Air Circulator metal base.Was thinking how best to get the missing items/parts?
2,Overly clever translation that should be avoided.,"This is obviously a translation meant to be read and not performed, and thus has lost the purpose of Lysistrata, and best to be avoided at all costs. Professor Parker's tortured retelling of this very funny play sucks the humor out in favor of clever witticisms and offensive stereotypes. He has forgotten that this was a play written during the Peloponnesian Wars, and was a direct response to that conflict. If he had not, then why the references to Hamlet and other plays? Are we supposed to follow the story or applaud Parker's precocious re-telling? If you read this play as part of a class and use the anthology ""The Living Theatre"", do yourself a favor and get another translation."
4,I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS FUNNY..,THIIS BOOK ALWAYS KEPT YOU READING. IT WAS INTERESTING AND THEY USED ALL MODERN-DAY TERMS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS
2,A Really Bad Translation?,"I find that I probably can't criticize Aristophanes for his comedyas it has lasted over a thousand years, but I can say that it must lose something in this translation. I see these other reviews andwonder if they are talking about the same play that I read?This is worse written than a ""King of Queens"" sit com...I'd walk out in the first act when the Spartan woman begins to do a dumb blond bit with bad grammar.It is so bad a Stiller ( father or son) would turn down the script! Save you money and time and find another version...."
1,Such an awful book,"I had to read this book in english class this year and it was absolutely horrid. The jokes weren't funny and the story was just stupid. Also, if you actually like the book, don't buy this edition because it falls apart. The book is about the battle of the sexes and it's stupid, pointless and boring. On top of it, you'll be really confused at times because of the old english. It's not a fun read more like a frustrating read. This is definitely one of my least favorite books of all time."
3,Not as good as Sweat,"here are the good tracks- play it off- my place- n dey say- nobody knows- die for youthese tracks are average at best. Nelly is not diverse enough to really expand the mind of the average person, so club bangers here they are. Three stars."
3,Nelly is alright with me!,"The suit CD wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but it did hold my attention. I think that it wasn't worth selling seprately, but hey! I would advise you to download the popular songs off this CD for .79 cents each and save your money!"
2,I thought it would be better :S,I was really excited that nelly released his cd's..but when i got them..i was kind of disappointed. It isn't as great as i thought it would be. Suit definetly dosn't have hit like nellyville did! i'm kinda mad about it. But i think if you really like nelly..u'll learn to love all the songs..
4,Suit Me Up I'm Ready To Listen,Great Album i bought both Sweat and Suit today and they are both great but i like Suit better its just a great feeling album and hands down my favorite song is Over and Over w/Tim
4,!!! Fo Reel !!!,"Good beats and good flows put this album on the must have list. From jump, ""Play It Off"" (f/ Pharrell) sets the tone for the album and keeps you on your ""Pretty Toes"" if your female, and then gladly invite her back to ""My Place"". The albums flows like a gentle stream and is all around a great cd for your collection. A must have for Nelly/Lunatics fans. The only song that came to question about how well it will do is ""Over & Over"" which features country music great Tim McGraw. This could breed a new style to hip hop. You may have thought that country and hip-hop could never join forces.....Once again, Nelly has proven many wrong. Four stars for this album...for making us buy two albums and this one being the better of the two."
4,sweat and suit! sweatsuit?,"corny names but anyway, nelly did an overall good job on this album. its softer music like everyone said. if u want mushy nelly, listen to this album. im not hatin or anything but some songs were weak! most of them were good but not all of them. track 2 is straight up corny! who raps about toes. ok, that one was gay but my place, paradise, she don't know ma name, in my life, nobody knows an' die 4 you were good songs. i agree wit most of u that nelly worked with 2 many people on this album, but some of their parts are good"
2,It should be free,This is a horrible album. Oh how I miss the Nelly of the past. Nelly sold out to people of MTV. Nelly has become the next Ja Rule. What has happened to hip hop?
1,nelly [...],"this album doesn't even deserve one star. it doesn't even deserve to be called music. what kind of person releases two SEPERATE albums on the same day, when they could release it as a double disc set like wu-tang and nas and outkast and all those other people did. [...] he doesn't even say anything important in his songs. he's a disgrace to the hip hop culture. [...] c'mon, what kind of rapper does a song with a COUNTRY SINGER!?! and also, christina aguilera? what the hell? [...] his CD's are commercialized poppy sell out [...]. bottom line: [...] nelly. [...]"
1,Suit by Nelly,"I personally have been a nelly fan since he came out, but after listening to suit, I was like..WTF! this is seriously probably one of the worst CD's I heard in my life, there is only one good song, and that's over and over, his last song that he talks about his daughter is second best, and is a alright song, but other than that, man he bombed this cd, it's just pure garbage all the way through. Just save your 15 bucks for this cd, or you will seriosly regret it, I am telling you now!"
1,Rap and R&B are dead,They are burned out and overrated. Ten years from now it will be like disco. I can't believe how lame this type of music is. The guy looks like a freak and is lyrics are non-existent. It is time to get rid of cds like this and get back to real music.
1,pathetic album,"this aint even rap, its POP music, hip-POP, this along with sweat are 2 of the worst ""hip-hop"" albums ever (as bad as 50cent's get rich or die trying, if they're that bad, that sez something), because they arent even hip-hop. nelly is commercial crap, just like his last album nellyville. dont support and feed out your money to a weak talentless little fool who wears a bandaid on his face coz he thinks it ""gangsta"". support pioneers of rap, support rappers with TALENT, support underground rap, dont support this CRAP. krs-one, rakim, slick rick, esham, eazy-e, dilated peoples, three 6 mafia, jurassic 5, styles of beyond, natas, the d.o.c., chino xl, kool keith, etc. coif u aint heard the majority of them your opinion is garbage, fo reel. DONT buy any nelly crap. (or other crap like jay-z, ja rule, dmx, eminem, 50 cent, d12, g-unit), BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE NO TALENT"
1,A truly awful album,"This could vary well be the worst album Iv heard all year.This isent even good for party rap.It truly is just a putrid sack of decomposing defecat.Not one song stands out,it's got the f*cking personality of a un-salted peanut.Avoid."
1,This is music?,"This is crap! He can't sing! I am sick of his second grade vocabulary level rhymes. If I could give this a zero, I would. If you want to listen to good Hip Hop, check out Beastie Boys, Run DMC, 2Pac, and etc. For good music in general, check out ColdPlay, Dispatch, and Jack Johnson!"
5,Suit is a great album!!!! 5/5,"This CD is a great music full of catchy tunes and great songs that never stop spinning in my CD player. ""Play it Off (ft. Pharell)"" is a great song with Nelly telling girls to ""get their story right"". ""N Dey Say"" is another great song showing that Nelly's sentimental side and MUST BUY FOR ANY MUSIC FAN! Album of the year! Also pick up Nelly's SWEAT, another AWESOME album."
1,GARBAGE,"nelly is a loser so are all you 4 and 5 star voters, all his albums suck he cant rap and never will be able to rap"
4,"I Like Suit, But Sweat Should've Been Left On The Shelf!!","I am giving Nelly's ""Suit"" CD 4 stars, because I likemost of the tracks on it.But he should've took the 2 good songs on ""Sweat""( ""Na-NaNa-Na"" & ""Deep Rivers"" w/ Damien Marley"")and tacked 'em on to this one!When he first relased two albums at the same time,I thought it was a good move because his last3 offerings were so tight!....But once I heard""Sweat"", I knew that was a grave error in judgment!To Nelly fans out there..Buy ""Suit"" and bypass ""Sweat""!!"
2,Sell out,"After ""Tip Drill"" came out on the remix album, I thought, ""man, Nelly is getting back to the street."" Great song, dirty, stuff your kid sister should never hear.Fast forward to today and Sweat/Suit is out. Total crap. Nelly sold out to make $$. Pick up T.I's latest for real street rap."
3,new afroman disc nov 2nd (christmas cd,why cant nellye combine all these into 1 disk.. just a question. save some money for the customer..peep the new afroman disk. its worth the time. join the streetteam on his website. we need your help.
3,"""Sold Out"" Does Not Apply","First of all, to all of young reviewers, give me a break. No, I'm not into hip hop or rap as I shall say...but ""My Place"" led me to this album. Its not a shining album admittedly...rather rushed in order to release two albums.But what gets on my nerves is to here people set a CD to their standards for ""selling out"". Selling out isn't bad! Selling out shows your status of acheivment! Stop being immature and act like respectable reviewers...one's WHO HAVE LISTENED TO THE ALBUM AT LEAST."
3,It's not all that bad.,"I Actually like this nelly album, although much better than sweat and certainly much better than any truly dreadful G-Unit albums so far, every song is softer and more soothing, although the writing is thicken, but this is a very decent cd.Thumbs Ups for me."
3,Nelly needs help and fast.....,"I went to BEST BUY to buy this SWEAT and SUIT albums.... this is a load of garbage.... especially the SWEAT album.... the only good thing about the SUIT album is the ""dilemma"" sound-a-like ""my place"" w/ Jahiem...Nelly is a 2nd grader rhymer that does not make any sense in his or the st. lunitics sound. Nelly sounds the same on each of these cds...If anyone has sense to not buy these cds please don't... and if u already have these LPs like I do take them back to get ur 20 bucks back because u will be very disappointed....choreohype"
1,when I listened to this....,"I used to have these terrible nightmares about being back in a Viet Cong P.O.W. camp. They would put bamboo under my fingernails and torture me all day long, I saw many of my friends die there. I was finally released in 1978 and when I came home I found out that my father had died from cancer and my wife was married to my favourite uncle. I recently bought this album and realize it is way worse than any of that. I have something new to wake up in the middle of the night screaming about."
1,I wish there was a rating lower than 1 star,"shame on anyone who gave this higher than 1 star, it's awful music like this that makes me want to throw my radio out of the window, i'd rather play Shaq-Fu on Sega than listen to this GARBAGE!"
4,Better than average,"Nelly doesn't thrill me in general, I think he's kind of a pig. But he definately shows a human side on this album and it is very easy to listen to, smooth, and I like it a lot."
2,Ok 2B Exact,The album is OK but not the way everyone is making it out to be. these are the type of songs you might like for about a week but after that you're done because Nelly's music hold's no longivity for the fact the songs he make are so simple & chessy. I would burn this album. I couldn't see myself paying over 10 dollars for 11 songs but that's just me. If you like the CD then enjoy it for about a week or two.
3,Back and Forth,"OK, Here's my thing with this album now i respect and do like the way Nelly goes and gets all types of genres to collaborate for his music, it really broadens his fan base alot more but my only problem with it is that the majority of rap fans atleast in my eyes dont want that and me my opinion of this album changes everytime i listen to it, Its not an album u can just pop in for any mood you're in which i guess is the case with any album but still, this album u will either love it or hate it thats as simple as it can be. If you're a hardcore rap fan dont get this but if u like the more broad branching out ""pop rap"" then get this."
4,Suit,"This is the better cd in Nelly's double cd drop. It shows the slower, smoother side of Nelly. His song ""Play it Off"" ft. Pharrell of The Neptunes is awesome!"
1,Nelly just cant do R&B...keep doing hip hop rapping,"Dilemma, the song that got Nelly into the R&B; world. His next R&B; song, Pimp Juice, which hardly got any air play. Nelly's voice is just not for slow smoothing rap. Most of the song is way too repetative. The song Over and Over ft Tim McGraw, all I hear is over and over again for the whole song in 5 mintutes. Songs such as Woodgrain And Leather Wit A Hole has annoying skits at the beginning that you do not want to listen to. Listening to Nelly trying to rap is bad enought let alone hearing him talking.One good song is ""She Dont Know My Name"" largely because Snoop Dogg saved the song from another ""Pimp Juice"". Yeah...Nelly keep to your party rapping tracks. These are tracks that dont have much legitimate lyrics anyway."
3,Sad that it's the better disc......,"The only reason I give this CD three stars is because of the song 'In My Life'. The chorus makes my girlfriend cry, she loves that song, and so do I. Unlike other reviewers, I like Mase, who appears in this song.As for the rest of the album.....Sorry. Just not the Nelly I used to know. It's pretty sad when crappy songs like 'Over and Over' get played over and over again on the radio. Oops. I made a joke.But I can't stress enough how great the song 'In My Life' is. It ranks up there with Nelly's best, such as 'Ride wit Me' and 'Number 1'. I hope it gets radio play sometime in my life."
3,A diffent side of Nelly,"Nelly has showed on his to previous albums that he does hip-hop and r&b. Sweat is Hip-Hop like Hot in Herre and Air Foce Ones. Suit is like Dilemma and Luven Me ( CG ). My Place obviously is the ideal 1st single but songs like Paradise and Die For You are also great songs. I think Nelly should have made one album cutting tilt ya head back & playa from sweat and added My Place, Paradise, Die For You, In My Life to Sweat. I like Nelly's R&B but not a whole album of it still you should get it for the songs i mentioned above."
4,nelly is putting it down,"I REALLY LIKE NELLY SO I KNEW THAT THIS ALBUM WOULD BE OFF THE METER. THE SONGS I REALLY LIKE ARE ""MY PLACE"" AND ""PRETTYTOES""(T.I. HAS A NICE FLOW AND IS DEFINITELY SEXY) BUT THE WHOLE ALBUM IS NICE FROM BEGINNGING TO END. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO LISTENING TO THE ""SWEAT"" ALBUM BUT I'M SURE IT WILL BE WELL WORTH IT."
2,Misleading Title,"I believe the title of this book should be ""The Complete Guide to Exit Event Stock Options"". The author makes his preference for Exit Event stock options clear early on, and throughout the book focuses his attention in that direction. For those of you who don't know, exit event options are stock options that only vest when a company is sold or completes it's IPO. This is a reasonable approach for companies that are likely to seen an exit event in 2-3 years, but not for a company just starting out."
4,good band.,"I like this band. If metal were a family, this would be Fates Warning's troublesome little brother. They are more close to thrash than heavy metal and I think have a really good sound. I'm sure some would disagree with the comparison to Fates Warning, but I really think they are similar."
1,The worst seller on your site,"Northern Tool and Equipment is a horrible seller that made a complete mess of this deal and never had the decency to respond to my concern (the product was damaged, not delivered and they never even responded).DO NOT BUY FROM THESE CREEPS!!!!"
5,I have only heard the title cut Shearing sings it.,I love instrumentalist who occasionally sing. Their voices are not polished but they have a certain quality that is fabulous. That adjective is not suffecient to say how good this title song is.
2,Bad mouse pad,"A year ago I bought a Belkin Gel mouse pad for my work at the local computer shop. I like it so much that I bought another Belkin Gel Mouse Pad for home use. This time I was very disappointed with my new gel mouse pad. The gel is much harder than the old one I bought a year ago. Obviously, they are not the same pad. My old one has a circle around the ""Belkin"" label and not on the new one. My advice to you is that if you are not sure about the firmness of the pad, buy at your local store."
1,Not good in the long run,This mouse pad was comfortable but fell apart after a few months. Probably will not buy again.
3,this is okay,"i was forced to use this for a while, and at first the wristpad is very hard, but it eventually molds to your wrist. so if you give it time, this mousepad gets comfortable."
3,Good ergonomically....,"I originally bought this pad for travel, and my last one with a wrist support died a horrible gooey death. The feel of this pad is great on the wrists, it is nice and FIRM. For anyone wishing for soft support, this is not the pad for you. The problem I have with this pad may actually be with the color. I bought the silver and (as a gamer) so far have found that my mice do not respond as well as I'd like them to. Half the time my mouse keeps going but the cursor stays still. This is annoying at any time, but critical during fast paced targeting games. This does not happen without the pad. Perhaps the black one would get a better response? In the meanwhile I use it while doing mundane trivial things....and not so much for gaming."
4,Simple and effective.,"As a graphic designer, I use my mouse A LOT! My end-of-day wrist pain has totally disappeared with this pad. My only complaint is that the fabric doesn't feel the greatest on my ultra sensitive bare skin."
2,gel pad,"this material is not the best for mouse movement and the gel pad has a lack of gel material in it, if it was purposely designed that way, it's a bad design."
2,Gel is not soft,I thought I was buying a support for my wrist but all I got was an item that looks like wrist support that does not support my wrist at all. It was nicely packaged but not what I needed. Some items you can not buy with pictures alone.
3,HORRIBLE SMELL,"1. When I first got this mouse pad, the smell was terrible for at least a month. I had left it out in the sun for a good 30 hours and the smell was still there. My wrist began to smell bad from using it.2. The wrist support is great! I don't use it while gaming because it tends to get in the way, but when using the computer for other things, it is awesome.3. No glitches when it comes to cursor movement. Works fine, and it accurate with a 1600 DPI mouse.(Update: I previously wrote that the pad made a ""scratchy"" sound. I found out there was a tiny sticker on the bottom of my mouse that would only make the sound on this mouse pad. After I took it off, I had no problems.)"
4,Advatage outweighs disadvantage,Gel pad is very comfortable but restricts movement of mouse.Pad itself works well.
1,A Sticky Situation...,"I purchased this item as a necessity for work (purchase requests and petty cash are nearly impossible there). It worked like a charm for about two months (I'm a film editor, so it was used A LOT). One day I came into work, started editing, and felt something sticky on my wrist. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from because my version was black. Eventually, I figured out that my wrist rest on my mousepad was slowly oozing it's gelatinous innards onto my desktop (and thereby my wrist). I have hairy arms, so this is an altogether unfavorable combination. So, what I'm trying to say is: If you have hairy arms (like me), don't buy this product."
4,Good,"It's quite comfortable at first, but after a while the gel rest begins to concave and now it's not as comfy as it used to be... Had it for about a year now."
1,Not quite what was advertised,"I purchased this mouse pad to replace a paperback dictionary I was using for a -wrist support-.I use a support to help prevent wrist -strain- when using a mouse.This was advertised as being 1.5 inches in height, which is the major reason I bought it.IT IS NOT!It is only about 3/4 inch in height.So now I still have to put a book under the -pad- (albeit a thinner one) in order to get the proper -height- that I want."
4,Belkin F8E262cSLV WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad (Silver),"Gel pad is not as soft as I had hoped! After using this for a while, I feel compelled to upgrade my score form a 3 to a 4."
2,Not happy with this product,This product contains lead and other harmful chemicals in the gel part of the pad. If you are allergic to lead do not buy this product. I bought 2 for gifts and have to return them because of allergic reactions to it. It is a good buy but not at the cost of your own health.
5,Classic TV Made Available,"At the time this DVD set was purchased, I was a 15 year old who had recently discovered the comedy of Burns and Allen. With only a few clips of the pair available on the internet I turned to Amazon to find more. This set seemed to be the most comprehensive I could find of their TV show. And after it arrived, it was exactly what I had been looking for. It provided hours of hilarious episodes in their uncut state including the great ""brought to you by Carnation evaporated milk"" bits. Though, as some have commented, the picture and sound quality isn't great, I felt like it added charm and it certainly didn't frustrate me."
1,DEFECTIVE DVDs - AND TERRIBLE SOURCE MATERIAL,"Not only are these transferred from terrible source material (interestingly, with an initial disclaimer stating they were made from the best source material available), but most critically, one cannot SKIP from scene to scene - or even episode to episode!! You are locked in Lousy-Source-Material-Purgatory.Do NOT purchase these. Good Times Video has a real problem on their hands with this poorly thrown together release.When, oh when, is somebody going to do the right thing by George and Gracie?"
3,"The show has its charms, but doesn't hold up very well.","This DVD is of reasonable quality for a public domain reissue--I saw just one of the two discs, and that one includes nine episodes of the show, with commercials (for Carnation Evaporated Milk) incorporated into some of them. There doesn't appear to have been much restoration of the old prints, but they are certainly watchable.I've been enjoying the reappearance of early TV shows on DVD, and I looked forward to taking in Burns and Allen. Alas, based on the sample here, the show doesn't rank with the best of its contemporaries. Gracie Allen is a classic character, and George Burns has charm, but the show lacks the wit, imagination, or great supporting cast that characterizes shows like The Jack Benny Program, I Love Lucy, and The Honeymooners. Burns and Allen has its moments, but it isn't in the same league with those."
5,For all the Marbles,"How is this album not getting any press in the indie rock mags? I read most of them to get suggestions on new music, but I have seen nothing on the Coral Sea. It's a shame as this could be one of the best cds of 2005. The easy, generic comparison to Bends era Radiohead is inevitable because of Rey Villalobos vocals, the symphonic sound, and the mellow drone. It's not nearly as dark as the afformentioned band. Overall it is a mellow affair with some songs coming off like if Mojave 3 turned up the volume a little. Rey's voice is really what makes this something special. The music has been done before, but not this well in quite a while. Get it @ www.thecoralsea.net because apparently you can't get it here."
4,the best music in years,"Its like a mix between mercury rev, lightning seeds and radiohead but still completely different. It is the most beautifully sad record written since Strangeways Here We Come by the Smiths. No review can do this album justice and I cant wait for another one from this amazing band. It is a 5 star album but i cant figure out how to fix it from the 4 stars i gave it."
5,AWESOME Bible to pick up and read and grow.,"This Bible is truly great to just sit down and read. It is set in east to read language and the verses are clear and easy to understand, i really like the book headers. And i would Highly recomend this for youth, who want to grow with God. I wish i would see more of my friends bring these to Bible Study."
2,Very attractive...yet less functional than I'd hoped,"I generally like all the Anolon accessories - they look nice, and I like the grey rubberized handles - they are my kitchen tools of choice. I bought the garlic press around 6 months ago, and it worked well for a while. I didn't have the same problem that the other reviewer did, but it just seems like the ""press"" (I don't know what else to call it) has stopped fitting into the other compartment. It's sort of strange, since it's metal and it's not as if it could expand in size (right?), but it just doesn't fit anymore. I do put it in the dishwasher - maybe that's problem. All I know is that I now have a very attractive garlic press that doesn't work."
3,"Nice design, but cheap metal bends/breaks over time","I have almost all the kitchen tools in this line and like them very much, but I have the same problems that 2 of the other reviewers had. After a year of use the mincing grill has cracked and many months ago the pieces stopped fitting together easily. Obviously this is made with cheap metal that bends and breaks over time. I am going to try a different brand."
2,"get peeka who, skip this one","My now 9month old loved Peek a who ever since he was 5months old. so figured he might like this one, but i was wrong. he wasn't interested in it at all."
3,board book with cut outs,this came to me as a gift from a mom whose child loved this book and another by same author. It never grabbed my son's attention or mine. there are cut outs in each page so that what you see through the cut out is just part of a bigger picture. My son is almost 3.
4,Fun for my little one!,"We love this book. Very fun for my toddler to turn each page with the hole in the middle, and easy to understand. A lot of books for his age have so much going on on each page. Liked this one with it's simple, yet just detailed enough illustrations, and educational play on words. Too bad about the last page...difficult to pull and easily torn, even though we tried so hard to be careful."
2,"Frustrating ""tab"" on last page doesn't work!","The book is cute in general, but the last page is very poorly made. I couldn't get the 'tab' to work, and ended up ripping the thing. Extremely frustrating, and I'm 31, not 6 months old!"
2,The picture and posted contents are misleading...,"This book is much smaller than I imagined, especially for the price. I would not recommend this to someone who intends to keep the attention of a child."
4,Nicely Laid Out and Easy to Use. Useful Maps,"It's light and compact and has some useful maps. We used the hotel suggestions but in most cases the ratings were off, if it says 3 stars assume 1.5-2 stars. Take ear plugs. Almost all of the hotels were in noisy areas. Many of the suggested eating places were also off the mark. Extensive menus would be met with three or four options available. The guides to sights and towns to visit were very good. We used the walking tours and maps to navigate through the country quite comfortably. Assume you'll be ripped off by every taxi driver and you'll be ok. It's still very inexpensive to travel in Tunisia. And this book is very handy to have along for the ride."
4,very cool short mecha,"I started watching this because I was intrigued by the plot...Brother and sister combinations are always a joy to the plot, throw in a heaping of betrayal and its gold to me."
2,Not worth the time,"I read the reviews on this site and based off of those reviews I bought the series. The series itself has mahor flaws in ir. these include a boring and extremely cold main character, for which you never really warm up to, a lack luster and out right boring plot and less than steller combat scenes as well patheric enemies. The one good part was that the voiceacting was spot on and the other characters were thankfully far more interesting."
4,some poetic justice for wall street - very funny,"The deal here is: poems about Wall Street and modern finance in the style of famous poets. He pulls it off nicely & makes it more than a one-line gag. Not many people who understand the significance of a federal funds rate cut, or rule changes by the Federal Accounting Stabndards board, can write in the style of T.S. Eliot and Joyce Kilmer. This is the kind of thing I'd like to give as a gift to my friends in the money business."
4,Quest 3,The book came with the CD as they mentioned under the description.my only complaint is that I had to wait for 11 days to receive this book from a LOCAL book company!!!!!! (Oregon trail company)
1,Tapioca hamburger buns,"I was really disappointed when I tried the hamburger buns. No matter what I did with them, including heating them in the microwave with a damp paper towel, they were hard to chew and swallow and did not taste anything remotely close to a hamburger bun. This is one item I would not recommend to any one."
5,best gf bun there is,"My son has celiac and we also discovered these while at Disney- I had seen them in the market but was reluctant to buy them because the idea of a bread with a sell-by date a year away turned me off. However, my son was so pleased with them at Disney that I ordered them when we got home and he couldn't be happier. When we open a 4- pack, we slice them all- he toasts the ones he wants immediately, and i put the remainder in baggies and freeze them- next time he needs one, it goes from freezer to toaster. Not only does he eat them at home, but if he is going out for a burger with his friends, he toasts one, puts it in a baggie and brings it along, at the restaurant he orders a bunless burger and when it arrives, he adds the bun. I suspect the folks that don't like these are comparing them to wheat bread- if wheat bread is not an option, you can't do better than this bun."
1,ENER-G TAPIOCA HAMB. BUNS,"I ordered 2 cases of this product - over 1/2 of them were totally green - apparantly Ener-g didnt seal the vacuum packs correctly. This is a great tasting product because I have purchased this product previously. Amazon did give me the credit for it without any hassles, but this was a real turn off to this product."
5,"GREAT MUSIC, GREAT ALBUM, GREAT SINGER!","THIS IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC, GREAT LYRICS, GREAT SINGER, WITH DEEP SPIRITUAL (NO GARBAGE) MEANING, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, ROCK ON!"
1,Poser,"Give a monkey or gorilla a microphone, and WHOA, you have Scott Stapp. What really saddens me is all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this drek. Like the proverbial lambs being led to slaughter, these reviewers are letting this garbage be force-fed to them. Look at the album cover for a clue. No artistic value,no imagination at all. Just a poser who is arrogant enough to believe that a picture of him is attractive. Maybe to some teeny-bopper girls, but that's it. People, open your eyes and WAKE up. This is NOT good rock,hell, it's not even good anything. Save your hard-earned money. This joker needs to get a real job."
3,The Great Unknown,"Without his fellow bandmates it's hard to say where Scott Stapp will go. But clocking in at a mere 42 minutes there's little doubt that it's not in the length of material. I waited until this cd came up in the used bin at the local cd store. Very tired of wasting money on so-so cd's after reading great reviews. With that said, this is an okay release. It's Creed, but yet it's not. Some of the vocals seem a bit strained and there's really not alot of variation here other than Stapp was the voice of Creed and if this was a Creed album that would be fine too. Evident also is his dealing with the split of the band and his life in particular. Hopefully, he will get on the straight and narrow again and next time out provide a more substantial release."
5,"""Divided - Stapp Conquers""","Despite this CD's title, Stapp's latest offering unites more than it divides. Whether he's heading up Creed or venturing out on his own, there are two constants in Stapp's songs: intimate yet transcendent lyrics and unrelenting incandescence of melody. The Great Divide's cuts reach to the core of our emotions and shake our human vulnerability at its root. From the tempestuous ""Justify"" to the melancholy of ""Surround Me"", each of Stapp's songs provokes thought, evokes emotion and causes us to invoke the intensely personal experiences, both joyful and painful, in each of our lives that have made us what we are."
1,No surprises here,"The most annoying, grating, egomaniacal frontman of the last 20 years steps out on his own, and the results are exactly what you'd expect. Forget the music, which is every bit as dull, predictable, cliched and boring as his former band (if not more so); the cover alone is enough to make anyone want to put him in a headlock and pummel him: are supposedly committed Christians really supposed to be so obviously full of themselves?"
5,fantastic!,"If you love Creed, you'll love this album. Scott's voice is phenominal and his song writing follows suit. This album leaves us wanting more!"
3,"not the greatest, but good","I just listened to the great divide, and it was a good first outing for scott stapp. I loved creed, and was disapointed when they broke up. I think scott's singing is better than ever on this album--he really sings lyrics from his heart. What he misses that creed had is mark tremonti's musicianship. The guitar and music here sounds very generic and uninspired. I am in favor of the creed hard rockin songs. As far as compairing alter bridge and the great divide, i think that alter bridge wins by a little-- better music and the new lead singer is surprisingly good. As far as people bashing creed for sounding like pearl jam; when you get down to it, I think creed is better than pearl jam, not that pearl jam is bad, just song for song creed has more excellent songs."
1,Boring!!!!,"I was always a Creed fan...from the first time I heard My Own Prison. I enjoyed the passionate lyrics as well as the music. I assumed that most of the talent in the group came from Scott Stapp. I just listened to the Alter Bridge CD and could hear the distinctive guitar riffs and the beats that were so much of what I loved about Creed. I never knew that the talent in the group really lies with rest of the band! The songs on this Scott Stapp album do absolutely nothing for me...in fact, I could put the first song on ""Repeat"" and not even notice! Very disappointing."
1,Creed sucks and so does this guy!!!!!,One thing that I wanted to say that hasn't been mentioned yet (or I haven't found mentioned) is that this guy sounds like he has a humongous amount of food in his mouth. Just eat a few marshmellos and try to sing a Creed song and you'll sound just like this guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not kidding he seriously sounds like he has something in his mouth while he's singing!
3,The lyrics killed the album,"Scott Stapp was good when he was with Creed, on this album, he is still Scott Stapp, but his lyrics are always the same.It is mostly about how ""God"" saved him which is totally ridiculous and how his soul is broken which he should have kept it behind him and not on his first solo album.He's got some great songs, his voice is special as always, but the Canadian band he hired, ""The Tea Party"" has done a better job than Scott Stapp himself on this album.The compositions of Broken and Surround Me are absolutely brilliant.All in all the album is good, but if only Stapp would have written better lyrics than about only his useless religious matter and personal problems, it would have easily been a 4 or 5 stars album."
1,"Ok, this is unacceptable!!! You 4 and 5 star people are scaring me!!!","Have I just been Punk'd? This can't possibly be real, can it? I couldn't get past that damn album cover, does this jackass not have anyone in his life that cares about him to tell him that this is total lunacy? Why didn't Jesus split the sky and throw a huge lightning bolt on his head before he recorded this album. As scary as this music is, what is scarier are the freaks giving this crap 4 and 5 stars. I would love to see those stellar music collections they must have. But then again, the sounds they are used to hearing are the cries and whales of the farm animals as they are getting robbed of their innocence. This music and that riduculous poser rock pose are about as unique as an A--hole. And he is an A hole if he thinks he can insult us with this garbage. I formerly apologize to Alter Bridge for saying they made the worst album of all time, because I hadn't heard this trash yet. I can't take it anymore."
1,This album clears up the past!,"After just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly clear that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was much less than he would have had us believe. This album is shallow, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His ""lyrics"" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album lacks is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature.. He said in the interview that similar to when Sting left the Police......HIS new sound would remain what Creed was.......Stapp should NEVER put himself in the same league with Sting......nor should he presume he has a clue as to how to write a hit song."
4,"Okay, but could have been better...","This is a pretty good start for Scott's solo career. I have always been a Creed fan, and enjoyed their style of music. It was saddening to hear them split up. This album by Stapp is totally rockin' and great to just jam to, the lyrics could have been a little more clearer though. There aren't many stand out hit songs except for 'great divide'. That's prolly the best on here. Other good ones are 'reach out', 'hard way', 'justify', and 'you will soar'. But really, this is a B grade album. Hopefully Scott will keep persuing this solo career and keep making great music."
1,What a joke!,"This jackass gets the award for the most self-absorbed rock diva of our time, with Fred Durst coming in a close second. These songs(surprise!)bring absolutely nothing to the table. Fake grunge was old when it was around in the mid and late 90's, it sounds painfully extinct when heard in the first decade of the 21st century.I really wish I could see the look on the faces of those masses of FOOLS who worshipped Creed because they were such a ""wholesome"" and ""inspirational"" band now that Scott Stapp has become the antithesis of what he was originally trying to portray himself as. The leather pants are still there, and so is the wannabe Eddie Vedder baritone and the Jesus Christ poses as well. But now we have several charges of drunken and disorderly conduct, an embarrassing brawl with 311, Stapp being a total douchebag on national TV while playing poker and a spicy sex video with Kid Rock.How do you feel about your rock god now Creedites?"
3,ONE DAY REMAINS IS BETTER....,"Finally Scott Stapps solo debut is finally here, does it live up to the hype as Alter Bridge did? In my opinion, no. This album just sounds like Weathered part 2 at least on Alter Bridges debut album they didn't try to sound like there previous band and tryed to sound like a whole new band to approach a new audience and to me they lived up to it. This is an average cd by all means, all the songs seam to mellow for my tastes I am a CREED faan and even for me this sounds like it was rushed into to quickly and it could've been put on hold a little longer and then it could've been a great album. Stand-Outs include, Reach Out, Fight Song, Hard Way, Justify, Let Me Go, and The Great Divide. The rest just seem like fillers and were added to make this album a little bit longer. Hopefully Scott Stapps sophomore album is 10x better or I will have given up on him completely. I am looking forward to the new Alter Bridge album and wish them and Scott the best of luck in the future."
1,Scott Stapp was not creed !,"I used to love Creed and used to defend Scott against almost everybody that was around me until I realized that he is a real jerk. I remembered that Scott said that he didn't want to play heavy rock and that it was Tremonti's thing but I wonder why he is using so much the style that Mark created for Creed. Anyway theres only three or four songs worth listening in this record, most of the other stuff is boring or too slow. Broken is one of the worst songs I ever heard."
1,EDDIE VEDDER'S DEBUT ALBUM,"Eddie Vedder's first album, 'The Great Divide' is pretty bad.. he sounds like a wannabe of his former self when he made the first few Pearl Jam albumsAfter Pearl Jam broke up a couple years ago, the members went on to form 'Alter Bridge', which is a terrible band, then Eddie Vedder went solo.. unfourtantely this is one of the worst albums of the year.. the singing is a joke & sounds completely forced & phony, & the lyrics are horrible.. nothing compared to how great Eddies lyrics were in Pearl JamI hope Pearl Jam get back together."
1,I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit,"This review is based solely upon the album cover and Scott Stapp's status as a tosser. If you go to a record store, see this album cover, and think, ""Hey this looks cool; Scott Stapp is a rock star; I believe I shall purchase this,"" then you have serious problems. If you bought this album because you liked Scott Stapp's work with Creed, that's a little more excusable but you still have problems because Creed sucked and Scott Stapp still wore those leather pants and executed horrid rock star poses.Hey did you hear about how Scott Stapp got punk'd whilst trying to meet some girl for a booty call? Or did you hear about how Scott Stapp drunkenly and belligerently tried to get into a fight with 311?Scott Stapp sucks."
1,same old garbage,"Just like creed, this too sucks! It might even be worse than Creed. Avoid like genital herpes"
4,very satisfied,"I am very pleased with this transaction... good deal, fast delivery, quality product... I would buy from this company again."
3,Decent set but 2 or 3 episodes freeze,"There are hours and hours worth of discs here and 2-3 episodes have skipped on me so far, not enough for me to return it yet. I don't like how the discs are held in the chart holder it feels like they will pop out. Scrubs is a great show and this is a must for huge fans but if you are just a casual fan watch it on your Netflix subscription."
5,great series,excellent ... totally recommended. Met my expectations to one hundred percent. I like the band. 'll buy music by amazon.
4,Love having it; hate dealing with the packaging!,"I've held off for years buying this series because I didn't want all the individual season boxes and was super excited for a chance to have it all together in one box. The box design, while neat in concept, is much bigger then I would like making it difficult to find a place where it fits on my shelf. I also don't like how I have to pinch the end of the disk to pull it out of its slot. The series itself is great and I enjoyed watching it again, even the last season I never saw before."
5,Perfect all around,"Came in mail quickly, and although it was used it looked brand new. A very good price for this item."
2,I don't like it,"The description of the product says that the serie comes with the tittles in Spanish and French, when it really comes with the tittles in English. I feel very disappointed about this."
2,scrubs the complete collection,"Two stars on this collection. It would be 5 stars but the collection came sealed new in the box, missing the 1st season disk. Go ahead and try to get someone on the phone after an on line purchase. It didn't happen for me."
3,"Nothing special but hey, its Scrubs","So i get the box right, its an actual box. see that silver box in the picture, it holds those files inside and the only thing holding all the files together is 3 bolts drivin were the binding should be. but hey IT COMES WITH ALL THE SEASONS OF SCRUBS. so really its just a collection of the pest tv series ever. Nothing special"
2,"Great Value, Poor Quality",My first time buying an inferior product on Amazon. Several Episodes will not play. I wish I could remember how many but I know its atleast 7. Pretty frustrating when it happens. One disk is almost entirely useless and may become a coaster. Great series with many many episodes for the money but falsely advertised because you will not get all episodes. If not for this issue I would rate a 5.
1,Last two seasons not presented in OAR,"Seasons 8 and 9 are presented in 1.33:1 (fullscreen), as opposed to their Original Aspect Ratio (1.78:1). This means you're missing about half the shot that was creatively intended to be in the image."
4,"Great show, but is now on instant watch","I love Scrubs and have probably seen every episode 3-4 times. However, if you are a Netflix subscriber save your money as all the episodes are on the instand watch streaming service now."
4,The 24th of June.,I think the shipping and customer service is great. I bought this book as a gift for my mom and I don't think she has read it yet.
4,No instructions,"This is a very good little cleaning kit with everything you need to properly clean a flute. There are, however, no instructions so I am at a loss for how to use the oil. Other than that everything is good quality."
1,This gives frustration rather than savings,"Not one of America's best gifts to England :( - -A couple bucks more for the Signet or Folger editions will help you so much more to appreciate our Bard. (or... if you're a Brit, the ""New Penguin"" edition is a great way to go).Like Steve says, you'll get NO help (or love) from this *thrift* edition."
3,Just Dandy!,"I found that this book does a better job explaining how to grow than most books, but i still found that i had some questions at the end. Some parts can be quite confusing, but overall it gave pretty clear instructions. This is a good reference book, but don't depend only on this book if you plan on growing. And make sure that you grow ONLY for medicinal purposes :)"
3,Very simple,"This book is small and simple, not much detail which makes it great for the beginer. The price is a little high though for what you get, therefore I had to give it only 3 stars."
5,Fantastic,"This is a must have for any Wilson fan. Reuben's organ work is fantastic throughout and he thrives in the pocket on this one. The other players on this one do a great job but it is Reuben's organ that is the focus of A Groovy Situation. And he delivers with great solos and heads on all tracks. Especially notable are the tracks While the World lies Waiting and a cover of Stevie Wonder's (I think) Signed, sealed, delivered, im yours.A great buy for any Hammond B3 fan."
3,Primera LX810 inkjet cartridges 53376 and 53377,This product is specialized for the LX810 Label Printer from Primera. The color output in and of itself is satisfactory. The major drawbacks are a lack of recycling of used cartridges and the low yield for quality prints.The printer itself also does not allow for edge to edge label printing.
4,"The Legend of Drizzt Collector's Edition, Book IV","My biggest problem with this book is the lack of information in other reviews and the description on the content of the book. It is three books: The Silent Blade, The Spine of the World and Sea of Swords. This duplicates 3 of the books in the Paths of Darkness gift set which I already have.If you have enjoyed Drizzt Dourden, this continues the story from Passage to Dawn. This series would be confusing if the reader has not read the earlier stories. Wulfgar is back to the material plane but emotionally scared from his time as Errtu's prisoner. The other friends are on a quest to permanently destroy the Chrenshinibon crystal. This moves the life story along of Drizzt, his friends, and the Forgotten Realms fantasy created by Robert Salvatore."
3,Good but loud,"It makes great juice. No need to even strain it. However, it's way too loud. It sounds like a lawn mower."
1,Don't buy this. The model is no longer being made by Breville.,"It came with a huge crack in the pulp container. Breville sent a new one and all was well. Now the part where the spiget has the juice flow out broke so it won't work. Breville said they no longer make this model, there no warranty, so it's useless."
4,"Works well, but sounds like a freight train...","I bought the refurbished model and at $70, I consider it a great deal. Quality of construction is excellent - it is a very simple design, but does its job well. I expect this juicer to last a long, long time.Really the only negative is the noise. It is about as loud as a blender, to be fair, but not exactly something you want to use with people sleeping in the house.Clean up is super easy. Just rinse the plastic parts and gently scrub the metal strainer immediately after using and you won't have any problems. Wait for the pulp to dry on to the parts and you'll have to put it all in the dishwasher."
4,GOOD,"Still has a problem spitting juice from edges. Easy enough to clean, and too big for my LITTLE kitchen. Otherwise, very nice."
5,Much better than my old Braun juice extractor,"There was no indication of refurbishing of this juice extractor. Everything was well packed in new condition. So far, we are very happy with the performance. The pulp is very dry. The only minor concern is that this machine is very powerfull resulting in smaller fruit pieces fed to it get thrown away before juicing. It's a well built heavy duty machine."
5,Great pretend play,"We got this set for my two year old son and he loves it. (You can check out my reviews of the individual pieces.) The garage door broke the first day, but he doesn't miss it. He plays with this set every day. He takes the ""guys"" with us often, usually with the fire truck in tow. He'd take the station with us if we let him, but we leave it at home.This is great for recreating fire stories and making up new ones.I highly recommend this product."
5,I love Hometown Heroes!,"This is a great little firehouse! My son had a firetruck from last year, which was also by Ryan's Room and he still loves it. Now that we've added the station and more firemen he's all set. I think the house is durable and it was easy to put together. My hope is that this piece will last him a long time and be possibly be passed to his own kids...we'll see!"
4,Hometown Heros Fire Station,"Our 3 year old grandson has had great fun with this. Only challenge is that his 1 1/2 year old brother keeps taking out the fire pole. Wish there was a way to make it more secure but other than that, a fun toy for a kid who's enamored with firefighters."
2,Only if you don't have access to the internet,"This book was actually the worst and the best that I've gotten so far. It's divided into three sections. The first is a sort of guide to raw. I really liked this section because it had an in depth explanation of how to sprout things. There was also a good dehydration chart and a wonderful explanation of the various appliances needed. I didn't like the juicing overkill...but that's personal. That said, all of this info can be found on the web. The second part is full of recipes. They are, for the most part, awful. The ingredient lists are a mile long and the prep and lead times are beyond hellish. The last part wasn't needed. Anyone with access to the internet could find this info."
4,Garmann Khia,"This is kind of raw. Khia is the mistress of the single entendre. ""My Neck, My Back"" bluntly tells the truth from her perspective. It has a very catchy hook. Parental Advisory, Explicit Lyrics."
2,WANNA BE TRINA/FOXY BROWN/LIL'KIM,KHIA NEEDS TO STOP SHE IS NOT MEANT TO RAP. SHE NEED A DIFFRENT JOB BECAUSE RAPPING IS NOT MEANT FOR HER.
1,Toss This toward the trash pile!,"YECCHHH! This is low-grade garbage-rap at it's subterrerean levels! Sounds like the kind of stuff that junior high kids make up to sound ""grown"" and ""nasty"". All the ""songs"" are either about explicit sex or women hating each other to cheaply produced beats and one of the most unappealing, rough female voices to be heard in some time (even Trina and Little Kim sound classy comapred to this). This ain't ""ghetto fabulous""-it's SLUM PITIFUL! Do the right thing with this CD-go to the nearest JUNK YARD or TRASH PILE, give it a good aim and FLING IT HARD!"
1,UGHHHH!!!!,"OMG...this CD is so unappealing!! It's the only CD that has tempted me to throw it out the window! Besides ""My Neck, My Back,"" the cd is terrible. The sound is cheapand the lyrics are completely pointless and disgusting(at least Trina and Foxy are funny). Don't bother buying this cd. Burn the only good song on it and save yourself the $17.00."
1,A Disgrace!!,"People, it just doesn't get any lower than this. This woman not only shames herself, but she helps spread a very negative image of black women around the world. She has terrible rapping skills, cheap production and nasty lyrics that only talk about getting laid and paid and how people hate on her. Whatever!! Avoid this cd at all costs. The cover alone should be reasons not to buy this cd."
1,UGH!!!,"This woman is yet another example of how far gone hip-hop is. I wish it was like it was in the 80's. Back then, people were rapping about having fun or social problems like racism. Now, it's all about sex and video girls with butts the size of the moon. Khia, you can't rap. Even if you do rap successfully, it's dripping with sexual innuendos and cursing every 2 seconds. Whore. Get some Salt-N-Pepa instead."
1,Nothing more than trash....,"This is exactly why no one takes Southern rap or so called hip-hop seriously. The degradation of society and the damning of the true art of lyricism continues to take serious blows to the head with this cauldron of ""ghetto-fabolous"" antics. No one with an intelligent mind would be caught listening to this."
1,Khia is Garbage,"The only tight song on that album is K-wang, but there is another version from this cat name De'Ice. It's alot better. Besides, most of Khia's material is stolen."
1,Shameful,"Khia is originally form Tampa florida for those who didnt know and im ashamed of that.Theres only three good songs,K-wang,lick my back, and dont trust no N*$!@.Dont buy the cd get someone to burn it for you!"
1,This Chick flamed out,she got boed out of some of her performances. She had one good song and maybe 1 or 2 ones that could be considered near decent.All of the songs sound the same they are all raunchy sexed up songs.MTV did not even give out this album so you should not either.Bad Lyrics + Bad Production + Bad Promotion=CrapLyrics -1 Production -1 X Factor 3 Classic 2 Replay 1Total=a 4 out of 100 are 0 out of 10 Fingers
1,This is ... not Rap,"I totally disliked this CD. The song my neck my back, may appeal so some listeners... While I respect the artists right to free speech, and all, I don't see why anybody would want to purchase such filth, because it is nothing more than musical porn."
1,a joke if there ever was one,"khia is just another girl out there talking about oral sex and dogging brothers, hey somebody gotta fill lil kim's spot til her next cd comes out. I heard nastier songs and why anybody would call her the female luke is smoking much ... use luke is the king of nasty and is laughing at this ... as I write this.if you wanna hear some girls talk nasty pick up h.w.a's old joint livin in a hoe house, or the big payback by choice."
3,"Yup, me too...","Well, a couple of her songs are cool..honestly i'm not into too much hard core music.. but i have to agree with the reviewer from Miami.. there is too much hatin on this chick.. i see it like this, if you dont like her then don't listen to her.. simple as that.. buts its funny when other male artist come out with lyrics similar to hers but no one ever says anything about them.. females should be able to express themselves just like them, however they want..people may want to just entertain and not be labled as a hip hop artist.. big ups to ya, Khia..."
2,Thug Bitches!,"Im sorry, but this ugly garbage lookn beast, her CD's on this website, have got to go, before people start buying them, they're nothing suitable for these kids, and not good enought to listen to."
1,She's Fake,"Last i heard she was claiming a song (""look back at it"") that was by one of the females that sound just like her that was in the group Dirty South Divas(DSD) who was featured on this album..dont buy it,the tracks may not be hers..lol!"
2,This song.....,"I really don't know what Khia is doing on this song, but all I know is that it's too much! It's one of the craziest songs I've heard in a minute. I don't see the point of it, and it's not one song that I would play anywhere!"
1,Another rolemodel for our kids,Gee another rolemodel for the children of our society. I guess making videos that are on the borderline of being pornographic and singing songs that are loaded with excessive obscenity and no content and are about having sexual relations with someone new every twenty minutes and BAM! You are a success. Sad. Just sad.This album is a joke. Khia has absolutely no talent except for singing songs about having sex with a different man every hour and being a hoochie [prostitute].End of Story! Now excuse me while I get back to my class act Peter Gabriel.
1,worst female rapper since feminem,"I dont know where to start with khia! She has the most annoying drawl i've ever heard, her lyrics are elementary, songs are raunchy garbage, production sucks, contradictory character, she sounds like a true to life idiot in her interviews, pitiful image of a black women, appeals to teenagers and so-called adults,a body that looks like it was in both world wars, f**cked up teeth, she looks like mojo jojo and only a fag would lick someone's buttcrack! khia is lucky that sex sells and underground radio station djs are dumber than they look because without these two major factors she would have went plastic! She is just another example of what aspiring female rappers should'nt be: a hiphop hooker!"
1,Oh heck no....music has just taken a complete U-Turn....,"...for the worst. It's no wonder Jay-Z is retiring. After trash like this? C'mon now, did anybody tell her she actually had talent? After hearing that awful song ""My Neck, My Back"" last summer, how can that song be even worth consideration? Let alone a full CD. People, there is good talent out there, it's not mostly mainstream (and it's a shame it's not) and radio and TV sure aren't gonna show it. This is not good music.She's not even one-hit wonder creditable. And if she's able to sustain other album.....eh, let's just say I hope not. I pray not.The album cover pretty much speaks for itself. Stay away from this poor act."
2,HER SONG IS HILARIOUS!!,"I spun Khia's ""My Neck My Back"" at a party in Boston back in April and I couldn't stop laughing.Listening to this chick spit proudly vulgar sexual demands was something else.The chrous is dumb but catchy.Altough this song is very raunchy(listen to the uncensrored album version),it has the poitential to be a huge""Baby Got Back""-style hit.It's stupid-but-catchy novelty rap songs like this that keepsthe everlastingly slipping commerical hip hop game with a frank sense of humor!!"
5,BAD AZZ BI***,Yo I gotta be straight up with ya I take my khia everywhere I go. Khia is just like my sista I love every lyric that she spits. I really love Don't Trust No Nigga cuz you can't trust these no good bamaha's. Khia ain't nothina but the truth and she nasty with it. I love this cd so much I go to bed with it and wake up with it ride in the car with it and jam to it. Khia is the chick I love so much I've changed my nickname to Khia and my best friends love her to one of their names is thugmisses and the other is k-wang so we are the real Khiaettes of 2002.
5,BLAZIN',this cd is blazin'. i mean this is the kind of cd that you don't have to skip around tryin' to find good songs. every last track is blazin'. this girl is on fire ya' heard.
4,Interesting documentary with a beautiful building,"Interesting look at green building practices, and what it really means. Lots of interesting issues with environmentalism, gentrification, etc make this a worthy watch!"
3,"Works great, but won't charge your Treo","This product works great but make sure you are aware that it doesn't charge your PDA's battery. There are other pure USB syncing cables out there that have this feature. You can buy a small AC/DC adapter to use with it, but that's extra money."
1,Does not work at ALL.,"Hi All,To the point. This does not work for me at all. My PC/Laptop doesn't even recognize my treo when it's connected. Please don't waste your money."
4,"Wow, it's a tent!","Two things all buyers should know.1. This thing is HUGE. Like 3 1/2 feet tall in it's carrying bag.You'll not be carting this into the woods for a hike with the sweetie unless you bring a hand cart or something. It's a monster.2. It's comfy as all get-out. It says ""0 degree rating"" but it's not stiflingly hot (I'm 190 lbs, wife is 118) for two normal sized adults. I guess if you're 270 or something it'll probably get swelteringly toasty.We slept comfortably in 60 deg weather with it and didn't sweat a bucket. We've also slept in 25 degree weather and kept plenty warm.It's more cocoonlike than you'd expect, keeping a moderate temperature instead of cooking or freezing you.If it weren't for the size of this thing we'd be 100% pleased. It just weighs too much to cart around to more adventurous areas."
3,pretty good,"prosits huge and it canvas both good things.consthe zipper is small and cheesy, the bag is small, made in china"
4,great bag,"this bag has plenty of room, is warm and comfortable even just to lay on top of to nap in the afternoon - the stuff bag was hard enough to get off - didn't even try to put it back in - instead got some straps to keep it rolled and will be looking for a large duffle bag for storage"
4,Nice warm big bag,This bag kept me warm at 35 F but got a little hot at 70 F. I just slept on top and it's like a fouton. It is soft and super comfy. I agree with others that in needs a full ziper. Even a bottom zipper would help when hanging this out to dry. It's made in China. I had to tie the rolled bag up with 2 strong bungee cords to get it in the bag. It takes time. Maybe it will be less fluffy after washing. It is too big for my household front load washer. I like the canvas outer (less sliding) and soft flannel inside (warm).
2,Who Designed this stupid sleeping bag?,"This sleeper that claims to be a big double sleeping bag is actually smaller than 2 sleeping bags put together. is that a double bag? then to top it off it only has a zipper on one side. now this is a thick sleeping bag, but if you get hot and can't open the zipper it is a nightmare. also if you get claustrophobic (spelling error!) you can't sleep on the inside, and my pregnant wife needs to be able to get in from the side. we wanted to return it, but spending $35 to send it back defeats the purpose when we only paid 87 dollars for it in the first place. if the other stuff isn't enough the bag that comes with it is at least 6 inches smaller than it should be. you should be able to get it in and then use the compression straps. we had enought trouble getting it in the dang bag. needless to say we are looking for another bag that at least has zippers on both sides!"
5,BEWARE OF DUPLICATION OF TITLES!!!,Beware - titles in this box-set originally issued in 2006 are identical to the more recently issued WARNER GANGSTERS COLLECTION VOLUME 2.Major disappointment as family members purchased both sets as Christmas presents for me this year.Other than that the titles are just dandy - preference depends on which box art you find more appealing.
5,Great Buy!,"This item is well worth it's price. Nice craftsmanship & solid construction. The beveled mirror edges most certainly give it a more ""classy"" look. Item arrived before the estimated delivery date, well packaged, and was easy to install. I am very happy with the purchase!"
3,Good Intentions,"I wanted a printed copy of this book and thought requesting it in this format would be great, especially with the website for other free online books. However, without any proofreading whatsoever, the typos are plenty and it gets quite annoying to read. Luckily, I can find it online to correct those passages. It was not completely worth the price, but it was worth getting."
3,This product is limited in scope!,"The product works fine when using regular CRT type monitors but fails to provide adequate signal strength when using Flat Panel monitors. The 17"" Flat Panel I tested was one provided with a Dell system. So, if you're hooking up 2 CRTs to a single system this product works very well. But if you're hooking up 2 Flat Panel monitors, it will not work. Belkin is aware of this but they don't put this fact in their advertising and marketing literature."
5,A winner!,"A Drummer's Beat to Mend is a beautifully written, sensuous romance. I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. Ms. Swanson quickly drew me into her work, held me captive and at the end, all I could say was ""Wow""! I highly recommend this work."
1,A waste of time,This book contains an interracial romance between a Black woman and Asian man. I was excited about a book that explores this racial mix. After reading this book I was really insulted. The female character is a stereotype even though she is a doctor. She has attitude for days and explodes for no reason. The more insulting part is that the character is only seen as beautiful because of her white heritage. This is expected coming from a white author. It is impossible for a non black author to write about a Black women's experiences and feeling (fiction and non) because they can and will never understand.Don't waste your time and money on this book or the other one she wrote (Ebony Eyes).
3,Hmmm. . .,"As an interracial romance reader I can say that the cultures of the characters are what first caught my attention. It was very different to have an African-American (well biracial)and Japanese character. McKenna's character started off very good, but as the romance between her and Tetsu started she became very unlike who the author had originally written her as. The author also brushed over issues that needed further development such as McKenna's relationship with her ex-husband. McKenna's relationship with her family was too soap-opera like: overdramatic/unrealistic. SPOILER ALERT: Another pet peeve for me was the fact that when McKenna miscarried she didn't even inform Tetsu, for a reason, that was in my opinion, not strong enough. Lastly, there was this comment made where Tetsu says something about McKenna's hair being the way it was because of the white side of her family. . .now that I see who the author is it explains a lot. . ."
5,Thorough and easy to read,This book presents the history of this country in a surprisingly thorough manner for a shorter history book. The struggles and strife of a people and a country are excellently portrayed with clarity and a hint at the emotions they must have felt. The struggle to protect the borders of the land from powerful enemies coming from all directions provides an interesting theme which kept me reading. I was also emotionally touched by the bravery of these people in defying Hitler and refusing to send Jews to their deaths during WWII.I was inspired to begin learning in more detail about periods and events in Bulgarian History.
2,Don't buy the Kindle version,"I have no problem with the content with this book but the Kindle version is horrible. The type looks like it was scanned in by an inferior scanner. Parts of many of the letters are missing, making it difficult to read. The illustrations are almost impossible to comprehend. I would request a refund but I don't have time right now to wait for a printed version."
4,A solid review of Bulgarian history,"This book provides a nice review of Bulgarian history, though at times it gets bogged down in a sea of place and people names, losing, for me the reader, the main thesis. I would like to have seen more time spent on ancient history, which was skimmed over quickly. And sadly, this book was written about ten years ago, just when change was rapidly occurring in Bulgaria. On the other hand, the information presented is generally quite accessible and presented in a balanced fashion focusing on important topics.Steven Mlodinow"
1,Useless,"Bought this because I also bought a non-stick sauté pan and didn't want to scratch up the non-stick coating. For some reason I expected the Nylon turner to not only not scratch the pan, but also be able to separate and flip eggs. Wrong. Everything -- especially eggs -- sticks to this turner. The edges are naturally a tad dull so they won't scratch, but my bamboo turner isn't sharp, either, and I can separate one easy-over egg from another with it. By the time I slither the eggs away from each other with this it's too gummed up to get it under the eggs to flip them. Cleaning it's no piece of cake either -- the eggs stick to it so badly I have to scrape them off with another turner. Truly the most useless piece of kitchenware I've purchased in a long time."
3,Supplement preventative,"I take this form of magnesium to also benefit from the calming effects of taurine. I am taking this as a preventative since magnesium is so important as a cofactor in bodily processes. One important preventative is regulating the heart's electrical processes. In this case, one cannot tell if it is doing anything obvious, but I feel it is important enough to take given that an inadequate dietary intake of magnesium is possible and even common in some cases."
5,Great Product!!!,"Again great stuff!! I've have tried a few different magnesium products... the two that I like are ""natural calm"" and this....this seems to be more effective and cause less side effects from the rest of the capsules/tablets out there. great for panic! great for GAD (anxitey) great for up-beat mood, great for keeping appetite in check, good for focus....if you want to know the details about how good magnesium is read Dr. Carolyn Dean's book!"
5,Same book as American Nomads,"An excellent book but be advised that it is the same book as Grant's 'American Nomads.' One published in the USA, the other in the UK."
3,A Compromise,"If you seen the work of Joseph Cornell before and loved it then you will find much to learn from in this book. But, I'm not sure readers encountering Cornell for the first time through this book will be won over. The detailed text by McShine is thorough, covering his life, his surrealist box constructions, collages and cinema. A huge amount of his work is reproduced, and an extensive bibliography are included. However, most of the plates are in black and white, with only a handful of colour photographs of his work. Moreover, the photographs of his work lack depth, so the three-dimensional tactile qualities of his enigmatic box constructions are lost. Perhaps these qualities would be difficult to convey in any photographs. So, it is not the perfect Joseph Cornell book. But the writing is interesting and I still loved looking at the less-than-ideal reproductions of his work."
4,Valuable document from MOMA,"Contents include the editor's introduction and four significant essays: ""the Trancendental Surrealism of JC"" by Dawn Ades; ""JC: Mechanic of the Ineffable"" by a frenziedly allusive Carter Ratcliffe, which among other things places JC in an American context, amongst Thoreau, Dickinson and the Puritans (!); ""The Cinematic Gaze of JC"" by P. Adams Sitney, a perceptive and authoritative survey of Cornell's films; and ""JC: A Biography"" by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan. These texts are heavily illustrated with unique supporting visual material. The plates of Cornell's work are unremarkable but there is the usual impeccable and thorough MOMA bibliography and checklist."
4,A decent overview of Joseph Cornell's work,"There are only a handful of Joseph Cornell books and if you're a fan, you'll probably end up buying all of them. This one is a bit thin (especially for the original price) but does cover not only the boxes (that I, as others here, had discovered at the Art Institute of Chicago) but his other varied works as well. Film isn't covered as well as the visual arts though."
5,"fascinante, novela historica","esta colección (son un total de 7 novelas) tiene la magia de transportarte al siglo XIV, y hacer del lector un miembro con oído y mirada aguda dentro de la corte francesa.Si te gusta la literatura o la historia no dudes en hacerte de la colección.

5,tough dog bone,I have a small yorkie that loves to chew and can chew her way through most nyla bones but this one is the the best.
4,Great! But smaller than I thought.,We have a 10 lb female Bichon/Poodle. We have a lot of different toys for her and this is not her favorite. The toy is pretty tiny compared to other small toys that she has. She rarely uses this. I am not sure if it is too tiny or because it is too hard. The toy seems real hard. I thought it would be a lot softer since these are tiny dogs. She prefers playing with other bigger Nylabone dog chews that are 3 times the size of these. We also have a 100 lb + rottweiler and he doesn't even bother with these. He usually destroys everything he puts in his mouth but this certain chew toy is still intact. Maybe this will work with even tinier dogs but they do seem a little too hard for them to chew comfortably.
2,Not pleased,I guess I didn't read the info very well because I was shocked when this came at how small it really was. I have a 22lb Jack Russell and this is too small for her.
1,Misrepresented Item,"The photos here are misleading. There are photos of toys which are NOT included. This is only for 1 toy, not the 3 pictured. Customer service was less than helpful."
1,Should have listened about poor customer service!!!,"I bought the bed on the strength of the other consumer reviews, thinking that the one complaining about poor customer service was an anomaly. Never again! The bed showed up without any of the screws or bolts needed to put it together. Several calls to the manufacturer went unanswered.I STRONGLY recommend against purchasing any products from Delta Enterprises. Save yourself the aggravation!"
1,Customer service?!,"Super fast shipping from amazon. However, we were missing a part when the bed arrived. I tried to call Delta for the missing part but could only get through to the answering machine. I've left several messages with no call back. I finally called a random person at the company who was unwilling to help me. She said to send a fax to the company. I sent a fax and still have not been assisted. I will be returning this bed. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
2,Cute but not a good bed,When I went to put the bed together the screws were missing then it took the company another week to send me screws. When I finally got the screws the bed was hard to put together.This is a cute bed but I would not recommend it to anyone. If you want this bed order it a year in advance so you have all the parts and can put it together by the time you need to use it!
4,"Excellent bed, but better off purchasing it in a store","This bed was not on my list of toddler beds because of the overall 3 star rating. However, when I saw it set up in the store, and did a thorough look over of the bed and found it to be very sturdy and of good quality, I decided to purchase it. Upon returning home I decided to read the reviews and noticed the main problem was no hardware. I checked our box and voila...no hardware. I called the store I purchased it at, and they opened another box and gave me the bag of screws and such.The bed took about 30 minutes for 2 adults to assemble, and like the store model it is very sturdy an no loose parts. My 2yo loves the bed. It is the perfect height for him to get in and out and he is very close to the ground.Overall, this bed was a great purchase. Just make sure you purchase it in a store, to make getting parts easier!"
1,Big disappointment,"We bought this product for our son. It has slats for support. It was hard to put together because two of the slats were too thick to fit in the slot for the rail, and you have to line them all up so the pegs fit in the holes. Relunctant to take it back, my husband sanded the edge a little, and it worked. It looked GREAT when we put it together. Less than 12 hours later, my 35-pound son plopped down (he did NOT bounce at all) on his new bed, and the slat snapped right in half. Turns out it is ""engineered"" wood: sticks the size of toothpicks all glued together to make the slat. If your child is bigger than mine or likes to jump on thier bed even a little bit, this is NOT a good idea. Those slats will snap for sure."
1,THANKS FOR GREAT INFO,"I almost bought this bed, thank you for all the reviews. I refuse to buy this bed. Sounds like the company is terrible to work with to get parts, etc. They just lost a sale. Not to mention other people who decided not to purchase this item due to comments made by people who received poor service. It might be a great bed but I don't want to be treated that way. Service does matter."
2,Not always the original artists,Most of the first CD (the newer songs) are not the versions by the original artists; most of those are performed by the Hollywood Star Orchestra & Singers.
2,Worked until warranty expired,Until the warranty expired it was fairly reliable with an occasional error message. All I get now are error messages.
5,Accurate & easy to use,"I bought this monitor for my mother, age 87. She had no trouble getting used to using it. We also took it to her doctor's office to have its accuracy verified. It checked out fine."
2,speak hindi and tibetan,"thought it would tell me how to read the hindi or learn the alphabet, vowels and so on.It doesn't; it just shows you how to say it in phonetics; so when there is something over the letter k I have no idea how to say it; like two half circles."
2,complete waste of money,"The mini water garden kit is definately not what the back of the box said it was. It looks alot better on the box and it certainly doesn't make relaxing water sounds, and I would never take it to work or on the road with me. The only good part about the kit is the book and you could probally get a great book for a few more bucks that is full sized, and has alot more info. Don't waste your money on this, you'll regret it!"
3,"very cute, corny... but cute","I work in a small cubical and wanted something inexpensive and small to fiddle with, this fit the bill.Granted, there are hardly any pebbles and mine even leaks a little... but I bought 3 mini kits (all different) for $5.00 at a local book store.It does what I wanted and pretty much expected it to do; put a little smile on my face when I deal with customers on the phone all day. For basically $1.66, it's worth it to me.I wouldn't buy it at the asking price on here, but if you find one at a clearance price like I did, I'd say go for it!"
1,Waste of money!,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers: this was a complete waste of money! Not only was it ugly (not enough stones, obtrusive cord/hand pump) but when you squeezed the fountain hand pump, the water shot right onto the table. This did not invoke tranquility!! There's no way to adjust the angle of the stream of water, either, unless you prop something under the fountain cup. And the book that comes with the fountain has so little content that you can ""read"" the entire thing in about 12 seconds.Save yourself the aggravation... don't buy this! The sound of (literally) flushing your $ down the toilet would probably be more relaxing than this... and the net result is the same."
1,ahhhh borin as hell,i admit there was a few good parts to the book but most of the book was boring. too detailed and in the first 150 pages...nothing happens!!!! she took forever to set up the story and its too annoyingly detailed. dont read it if you can!!
1,This book totally stinked!,"I personally didn't like this book. It was extrememly hard to read, with confusing words and sentences that make absolutely no sense. In fact, I only read the first four chapters, and I know several others who could hardly read the first two chapters. Maybe if I had attempted to read more, I could've gotten into it, but I highly extremely doubt it. Well, if you are interested in reading this book, maybe you can try it, but if you dont get into it, FORGET ABOUT IT YO!!!! THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK-ITS 498 PAGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"A bit long, but hang in there!","This book, from the beginning was a bit scary. I say scary in the fact that it is a very thick book. I did not let that stop me, and a beautiful story unfolded before me. It is true that this story has a slow beginning, but if you hang in there you won't want to put the book down. The setting, the characters, the whole meat of this book is will draw you the reader so into the book that you will find it hard to put the book down. I personally love fantasy books. If you don't, after this one maybe you'll reconsider. Basically we get to watch how merlin handles the task of raising the soon to be king Arthur. There are many tasks and obstacles that merlin and his apprentice must overcome. It comes to an action-packed conclusion that you should not miss. Take my word for it and read thisa book. Like I said, it starts off slow but it will go 90mph as soon as you reach the second part of the book."
4,The story is enchantingly told by a great writer.,"The story of the Authurian legends are twisted with the creativity of Mary Stewart's imagination to create this enchanting telling of Merlin and his very own Aurthur. Stewart creates a fictional character named Ralph that the childhood of today's day and age can relate to. You follow Merlin's conquest through his trouble's and his trimphs until the very end of the book. It is suspenseful until the end, but doesn't give up then. It keeps you reading until the very last word. The only dislike that I have come to with this book is the fact that it is slow to get in to, but aren't the best understood books tht way? You must have a basis for what you are reading even if you haven't read the rest of the saga. (The first book) as I hadn't when I sat down to enjoy this well told story."
4,Good Purchase but shipping slow,"I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my wife on December 2/08. It showed up just in time for Christmas but was almost too late. Good Book, Great story. Just watch your shipping times if it is for a special occasion."
3,Outrageously Boring,"Mary Stewart is considered to be one of the major milestones, if that's the word, in Arthurian Literature. Yet I found myself skipping pages repeatedly. The plot in itself was interesting, mixing traditional arthurian legend with Stewart's own creativity. It is a powerful mix, but the potency is lost. Why? The passages are far too long, the descriptions uninteresting and repetitive. In detailing everything, the story was lost."
3,Doesn't measure up.,The continuation of the saga begun in The Crystal Cave is disapointing. The Crystal cave was a five star book and much better. As usual the sequel just isn't as good.
5,A fabulous trilogy!!,"The first three Arthurian Saga novels are wonderful. The fourth? Not-so-much. It's okay, but nowhere near the powerful representation of the story that the first three books provide."
3,Sophomore Slump???,"I truly enjoyed The Crystal Cave (Book 1). This book, however, left me skipping pages trying to find a part of the story that was truly interesting again. The book takes an unusual look into the life of Merlin and the first 14 years of Arthur's life. Perhaps the boring nature of Merlin's travels far and wide, the introduction and exit of many minor characters and the still under-developed story of Arthur's childhood are the reasons that other authors have simply glossed over this section of the story. IT IS BORING. I finally found true interest in the last two sections of the book - an easy 250 pages in.Read the last section - when Arthur discovers his identity, Morgause begins her trechery, Lot attempts to usurp the boy king and Uthur dies - that's all you need to move onto book 3. The rest is filler at best."
3,What really was behind the famous legends-,Amazing how Mary Stewart can set her fiction into the heart of 6th centry England.Merlin's life as Arthur's tutor was believeable-and it is also believeable what Arthur suspected about Merlin. This dispenses of the magic and tells the story of King Arthur as it could have happened.
4,Entertaining,"Merlin, as the narrator of this tale, is an interesting and exciting voice to listen to. Although the action is small, when it appears it leaves you breathless in its wake. The Hollow Hills is a beautiful story, aimed at those who enjoy the history under the coming of Arthur. If you were captured by the detail of Tolkien, you will be likewise captured in Stewart's The Hollow Hills."
3,Mike Gets a Job and Bax is Back with a Vengence!,"Michaelangelo is lazy but he wants a surfboard so bad he (dun dun dah!) gets a job! Delivering, of course, pizza. Something's just a little familiar about his boss though. ""Return of the Fly""? Couldn't've said it better myself. Bax is back and ready to do the TMNT, Shredder and Krang harm! Yikes!"
4,great but not the origanal comic turtles,This is the best animated turtles video that there is. funny and slightly close to the ninja turtles comic in the pages of heavy metal magazine.
2,A Butchering They Went,The Original 5 part 100m mini-series is poinlessly edited down to 70 m. Pass on this and see the full version.
1,The epic is truncated,"Just confirming what the reviewer below stated. When I was a kid, I saw the TMNT miniseries in December of '87 and loved it. When it came out on video a few years later, I begged my parents to rent it and even on the first viewing, I realized that a lot of footage was missing (particularly the scenes where the Channel 6 building floods, and the scene where the Turtles fight Bebop and Rocksteady at the zoo). The full miniseries (uncut) gets five stars from me, but the heavy editing of this release is unnecessary since huge plot elements were cut."
3,Works in light mosquito conditions....,"Ok. I've used this for several years now. In our previous house, we were on a lake with a constant breeze. It wasn't a wooded area, and the mosquito population wasn't too problematic. I'm in South Louisiana, which is definitely mosquito country, but we didn't have a bunch at that house. Having said that, this product always did the job there. We recently moved to a house that is surrounded by trees and wooded areas. This product does very little for high mosquito areas. I've had to resort to the 5% DEET for my kids. I've tried ALL of the non-toxic options, and they just don't cut it. If you are up north or in a light mosquito area, this should work fine in my experience. Otherwise, keep searching."
2,Not sure this works,"On a 1 hour hike by a stream, we had to reapply this several times. My pre-schooler, who has pollen allergies, sneezed rapid fire for quite a while after each application. I wanted something natural and may have continued using this despite the need to reapply, if it weren't for the sneezing."
2,So true...,"Indie rock would have been good, even better than this. I mean, it was supposed to be the college years mix and it's still high school love songs all over again. As the show became a bit more mature it soundtrack didn't,which is kinda let down for me. Anyways, not everything is bad (""make it right"",""not one more time"" (fave track),""everyday of the week"",""moving on up"",""saturday"" and ""touch my light"") but most of the songs are too cheesy plus a bit too early 90's (we're in 94) to feel a bit of a change.One question though, were all the songs heard on the show or are there a couple inspired by it?"
2,Half the album good; the other half bland,"This is not as strong as the '92 soundtrack that came before it. While there are good numbers by After 7, Hi-Five, Cantaloop and others, half of the album is consisted of bland, faceless numbers that wouldn't have been played on the TV show in 1994. I don't listen to this one as much. The album tends to shy away from the mostly dance pop of the other one for the show's characters being in college. But the ballads are surprisingly bland and there's not a continuous balance on the album when you hear it. So I suggest you pass on this one and stick with the '92 album instead."
1,Wretched,"Like the plot segment of the prime time soap this soundtrack is named after, the material contained on this CD is simply lackluster and an attempt to cash in on the earlier (more successful) soundtrack for the series High School beginings.The selections do not even reflect artists that would be popular on a major metropolitan college campus (indie artists), and the sound eventually blends together in an inchoherent but iritating mix."
3,I's is not the type of exercises of the real test,"Since the Gmat test is manage for other people, the exercises are different. This book is a good tool to start the work. Much of the exercises in this book already are in the 10th and 11th edition of Official Guide for GMAT Review from ETS."
5,Must to have for GMAT prep,This is must to have book for GMAT prep. Only thing which I can say is wrong is it does not shows the level of difficulty.
5,good book for GMAT,"Basically I use this book to enhance my reading skill and writing skill because I am writing my dissertation. Although I read academic journal almost every day, when it comes to writing it becomes difficult. This book can help me to organize complicated sentences."
4,Same os OG10,The book is good and provides additional actual exam questions. But if you are already in possession of OG10 then do not buy this one since the questions are the same.
4,"Not All New, But Not Bad Either","Contrary to the information at some MBA chat sites, the questions in the two supplements, The Official Guide for GMAT Verbal Review and The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review, and the main volume, The Official Guide for GMAT Review, are largely carried over from the 10th edition and the PDFs of retired exams sold by MBA.com. So if you have the 10th, you won't get as much as you might hope from spending for the new main volume, or $17 a pop for the supplements. You will get what GMAT calls ""improved"" explanations. Improved? Maybe. They're still pretty circular at times (eg, D is correct because it's uh....correct), but they do seem more detailed and better organized. These books are good study tools, just not as new as the GMAT folks would like us to believe."
2,Helpful material but it duplicates the verbal section of the complete guide..,This book contains exactly the same material contained in the verbal section of the complete version of the Official Guide for GMAT Review (by the way I've checked only the reading comp section). So don't buy this book if you already have the Official Guide and you are looking for additional verbal questions.
3,Not a good book,"If you already have the Official Guide for GMAT review, then this book is not worth the money.All the questions have been picked from the Official guide for GMAT review. So if you already have the GMAT review then this book has nothing additional."
1,A waste of time,Why in the world would someone post an omnibus three novel hardback for sale with no identity of what the three novels are. Amazon continues to allow this tripe and should be censured as well!
4,Not Bad for a Hackneyed Plot Device,"Krentz (also known in the Historical Romance Genre as Amanda Quick) uses the plot device of mistaken identity to get this novel started. The heroine is a typical Krentz heroine--sassy, agressive, and determined to see ""justice"" done. Similarly, the hero fits the mold of the tough, sarcastic loner just waiting for the right woman to arrive and bring him the stability he (supposedly) craves. A couple of confusing subplots and some annoying behavior by the hero (frequently he bellows for his Scotch before dinner) prevent this from being a great book, although it is a good beach or airplane read. I've read better from Krentz/Quick."
4,Great Cult Classic,"This game may not be the best graphically or have as many options as most games nowadays but this was one of the first games to change the micromanagement strategy of gold and wood which paved the way for newer ideas and thinking. This game has a somewhat steep learning curve but if yous tick with it you can become very good. Some game faults are that money carries over between levels, makes game very easy if you know about it but very hard if you don't notice it, the oldness of the game means computers can't actually be smart and have better strategies they get resources even if they are not producing them and just get more on higher difficulty levels, this makes for hard play until you are more experienced and then makes for very simple play. No skirmish or online multiplayer but the price is so low that if you have the extra cash you should give this classic a try!"
4,Mob Rule Review,"The game is pretty fun, but you are never really allowed to just build an empire and play. The ""Boss"" always has very specific goals for you to reach and at times the game doesn't recognize that the goal has been reached and you have to start completly over."
1,Dementions?,"What are the dimentions of your AC cover extra large? I need to cover my AC that is 28*28*20. Please reply to my e-mail.Thanks a lot,Eduardo"
5,Nice Story,"Jane hissey has a great way of bringing humor and feeling into this book. I found myself laughing more than once. Today, in this throw-away world, it was fun and refreshing to see that one pair of trousers could be used for so many things! This could lead to some great discussions of reusing things at home. The illustrations are soft and beautiful. Very nice book! Terri ""Hunter"" Ward, author of One Starry Night and Aunt Tami's Strawberry Farm."
1,Reformulated disaster,"I've bought this product for 5 years now. I bought some recently only to find the company has reformulated this once-trusted product. It now smells like some kind of rose water (prior having a more woodsy, seemingly less intentional scent.) It also is now a different color and consistency. The product I love is not this product. What a disappointment."
3,Just ok,I would not buy this again as it smells nothing like the Hemp hand cream and that's what I was going for..
5,This is a Great Treasure,"An immensely interesting timeline that takes you from Adam and Eve to walking on the moon. History buffs can study and read this chart for years on end. It is a visual representation of our past and graphically traces the nations, leaders and events of our civilized world. Great for kids to gaze at, grandparents to marvel at, and teachers to hang in their classroom as I did. Also helpful if your reading about the past to gather context about the time period. Makes a great gift. Do not plan to buy this and place on a self, you must unfold it and hang it on a wall to truly enjoy day after day."
1,complaint,"I ordered the Wall chart of history October 25. I still have not received it, Where is it???? You got the money now I want the product."
1,horribly fragile,i didnt even get to wear them because right out of the packaging they were already torn.
5,Why to get the 2005 vs the 2004,"Here's the differences between the 2004 and the 2005:1.handles are positioned better. (they turn in a bit, like the Mclaren)2. The locks on the back wheels are positioned better. This is a huge difference - the old model locks as you bump up the steps.3. The front wheel locks are sized better so that you don't have to bend down and fiddle with a small piece to lock the tires.4. There is a larger bar at the bottom of the bar sized to hold a toddler riding on the back. I don't know that it was the intended purpose.5. There is no pocket in the hood of the 2005 model. I'm not sure why they took it out.6. There is a parent cup holder on the 2005 model.Just my observations - there could be others."
5,Ever Original and Funny Keeps a Loyal Fan...,"(MANTRA)I look forward to the final season of ""The Guild"".I will keep an eye out for all future works the actors produce in their careers.(Unmantra)I give accolades to Felicia Day's wonderful work. I can't fathom how shoe-string budget productions like this have to fight for DVD release and garbage made by the likes of Michael Bay (BLOW S__T UP!) get released to movie theaters nation-wide. I'll vote with my dollars to keep gifted artists employed and keep me entertained."
5,Love 'em!,"The Guild is up to its usual strangeness: funny, funny stuff. Will Wheaton as a baddy is hilarious. Let's build Guild Hall! Interesting surprise guest at the end."
3,Audio is off.,"I was happy to have received the dvd, as I am a huge fan of the series. I was busy with school business, so I put off my marathon til summertime. When I started watching, I was disappointed that the audio was out or off sync for the first few minutes of each episode and random parts throughout."
4,Nice CD collection nice for karaoke too!,"I bought this CD,only to find out that the instrumental versions of the selections are not what they are ought to be.Lead instruments fade out,background instruments are more vibrant.Ronnie Aldrich or Reader's Digest key artists would have better complemented the fantastic strings. I think it's still worth listening to especially if you want to hear 50's and 60's music.Grab the microphone and sing out loud,a great karaoke CD too."
2,"I think this C.D. is wak, im dissapointed withit.","Who ever hasnt bought it yet, dont buy it because it is WAK and it only has one good song. This is very dissapointing that Juvenile came out with a C.D. like this."
3,it's okay,"juvenile is my favorit rapper, I think this cd aint as good as 400 degrees but i dont think it's as wak as they say it is. He's just doing his thing. If ya don't like it den don't buy it. There are some people out there who like it"
2,NOT GOOD,"The only reason I gave him 2 stars is because I like Juvenile.But all and all,he could of done much better..."
4,Juvenile is The Best Rapper,"Listen This Is A good cd juvenile & Cash Money Are The Stuff I Have All The Cash Money Cds since They Redid the Roster & For Juvenile in '94 & Under Warlock Records This Is one Hell of an Album Whatever Juvenile does Is Great So If you Claim you like juvenile & you didnt give this a 3 or better you aint no Juve, Cash, OR Rap Fan WOODAY!!!!!"
3,Basically the same as the original,"This one is basically the same as the original 95 release with the goofy album cover, hence the same number of stars. The MAIN difference is the beat for ""Powder Bag."" The original was simply ok, and I REALLY like this version MUCH better. As I said in the other review, ONLY TRU CASH MONEY AND JUVEY FANS CAN GET THIS ONE!"
3,South or West?,"I gotta say, this album is tight, but is it west coast music or is it that dirty south N.O. flavor we all know?"
3,HOW TO LISTEN TO WHAT IS ALL AROUND YOU,THE CD IS NICE. THE REASON IT HELPS IS THAT BOOKS AND TEXTUAL MEDIA CAN OBLITERATE THE REALITY OF LIFE ALL AROUND A KID GROWING UP .....IT LETS YOU IN ON RAP MUSIC AND MAKES YOU THINK HOW TOCOMPOSE RAP MUSIC. IT IS NOT TOO SCARRY.
1,HORRIBLE,When I first listened to this CD I couldn't beleive this was the same Juvenile that came out with 400 Degreez. It sounds like 80's rap. This CD is horrible and my advice is to not get it.
3,Bonnie Raitt is an awesome performer....,Bonnie Raitt is an awesome performer....One of my all time favorites.But... This video transfer / processing of this standard DVD is horrible. I watched the HD / Bluray version and it was excellent. This standard DVD version is awful. The audio is very well done on this standard DVD - so you can listen to it and it is sonically very good. I wish I could have returned it but no such luck. I have seen many standard DVD concerts with excellent HD transfers from the bluray master and I know from them this could have and should have been done more professionally. That is a good test as to whether to buy the bluray version - rent the standard version and if it is of excellent quality then the bluray will be better yet. lossless video and lossless audio......... Dissapointed - is an under statement for this title............
2,Bonnie Raitt and Friends,Was very disappointed in the CD. Had just seen her in concert - felt like her show was an exact repeat of this CD - could have stayed home and felt like I had seen the show. Was a purchase I could have done without.
4,A clear and concise book on beadwork.,I enjoyed this book. I found it beautiful to look at. It offers a wide variety of projects in beginner to experienced skill levels. The projects offered gave clear instructions and materials are readily available at craft or bead shops. I would recommend this book for someone just beginning to work with beads as well as the more experienced beader.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This is basically a project book, with only brief explanations of the author's beadwork techniques. Since the book reviews emphasized the innovative aspects of her work, I was somewhat disappointed to see how little creative exploration was actually presented.Unfortunately, the projects themselves aren't to my taste. But that's not a criticism -- just an observation of personal preferences."
3,I didnt liked it anymore,"This book give you a nice idea of how to make beedweaving, but the designs its made there is not useful and i was thinking after i make it what did i do with it, I give itto my friend and I dont like the things maded in this book, I think you could find another book with more creative things."
4,Interesting & fun facts,"We are enjoying this devotion with our 9 year old. I recommend it for ages 8 & up. It's fun to ""celebrate"" the various holidays (National Ferris Wheel Day on 2/14), to see how they correlate with God's Word, and make applications in our daily lives."
3,Excellent biographical travel narrative...,"I picked up Wriggins' book mainly out of interest of the Silk Road itself. The book recounts the journeys of a Chinese Buddhist monk named Xuanzang in the 600's that travels a fantastic distance from China to the deepest corners of India in search of answers to his metaphysical questions.I would have preferred a little more engaging of an account (such as perhaps Undaunted Courage by Ambrose), as Wriggins tends to describe each location and circumstance only briefly and then moves on with the narrative. On occasion, a few of the accounts are descriptive and moving, but on the whole, it reads more like a lecture in a history course.This is a detailed book that will help readers interested particularly in the impact Xuanzang made on Imperial China and the world of Chinese Buddhism because of his travels and experiences. For an engaging travel narrative or for a more vivid picture of the Silk Road itself, you'll need to look elsewhere."
2,Ipod,there was no where to hook the neck thingy. and I'm having a hard time grouping things; like audio books in one part and songs in another. it shuffles them all up and mixes them up. Like a song will play and then a chapter of the book and the chapters are not in order!
2,How do you attach the Lanyard???,The case does not appear to have any loop. How do you attach the lanyard? There are NO Holes on the back of this model. I have included a photo in my gallery.Don't buy this unless you have no plans to try to attach it to anything.
5,Love it!!!!,"Originally I registered for a Peg Perego stroller, but after seeing the Zippy at a baby store and testing it out... I was in love. The Zippy delivers on its promises, as it is the ONLY stroller I tested that truly could be opened and closed with one hand. Additionally, it is the most lightweight stroller I have ever used! Also, I can use my Graco Snugride seat because it has a universal infant seat system. It is more than worth the money."
5,Really good series,Really funny and well made - makes fun of both Jews and Arabs in the state of Israel and exposes the complexity and difficulties facing Palestinians who are also citizens of Israel.
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"The characters are either thieves or idiots and the story lines of this series are ridiculous. If you are hoping for an insightful look into this important and complicated part of Israeli society, you will need to look someplace else."
5,"No Hugs, No Lessons Learned","""Seinfeld"" was supposed to be a show about nothing - no hugs at the end, no lessons learned - just straight up human frailties. ""Arab Labor"" borrows that aspect of ""Seinfeld"" and marries it to ""All in the Family"" and then ships the whole thing over to Israel. It works completely.When I say ""Arab Labor"" on LinkTV, I fell out of my chair laughing. I have been waiting for season one and now I shall have it! This is, far and away, one of the greatest sitcoms ever made. It's irreverent, yet playful. True, you need to know some history here and there to get some of the jokes, but it's very accessible comedy - if you don't mind reading along. I'll admit my Hebrew and Arabic aren't up to snuff, but the jokes do translate well enough for me to fall in love with them.If you have no sense of humor, don't buy this. If you love it when sacred cows become hamburger, then this product is both kosher and halal."
5,hard drive worked perfectly,"This item shipped fast and was competitively priced. Worked perfectly when I installed it. However, I decided to return this item because freezing issue was not actually caused by my old hard drive rather my laptop battery. Return was fast and easy. Highly recommend this seller for an excellent product and great customer service."
3,"Decent if you don't care about the shoulder ""strap""","My wife and I purchased this bag for a vacation where we had strict size and weight limits for luggage and had to use something that was soft-sided. This bag met most of our objectives: it's extremely lightweight, has an enormous amount of space (especially when expanded), and can fold up to a small size. However, the shoulder strap is really mediocre - basically you disconnect one end of each handle and they buckle together. Not only is this uncomfortable (the buckle is right in the middle of the spot that sits on your shoulder), but it also refused to hold together and kept popping open - even when the bag was only half-full.Recommended if you don't plan on packing anything heavy or using the shoulder strap. This type of bag also really requires the use of packing cubes to keep things orderly - the bag has no structure otherwise."
5,wonderful music i've ever heard,"great music, great lyrics.perfect album for the metal fans in the world."
5,This is the best guide to goaltending I have ever read!,"This is the best guide to goaltending I have ever read! I often find myself refering to this book in practice sessions as well as in games. Ian Young expalins each and every situation with detail, so as not to leave the reader guessing. Not only does this book provide solid instruction, but it also focuses on the mental aspect of the game, a definite key to minding the twine. Young's references to his playing days makes the instruction that more understandable. A definite plus! Every goaltender should pick up a copy of LORDS OF THE RINK today!"
1,Language Barrier,"Although this is a tourist magazine, it is more appropriate for an Italian tourist...or Italian speaking tourist as it is entirely in Italian."
1,No good for the exam,"This book is more of a guide to consulating than a coursebook. Very little of the contents are applicable to the exam - look at the braindump sites and then compare the information presented in the book with that asked in the exam - there is NO correlation. If you want a VERY high level VERY general guide to design, this is the book for you. If you want any chance of passing the exam, forget this book, look elsewhere. The relevant material (no more than 10% of the total contents), is discussed in SO little detail as to be pretty much, (but not completly) useless. If you have done a course or used other material to revise from, this may add some value, but otherwise it is not going to get you through the exams. First Osborne book I've bought, think it may well be the last."
1,Absolute fluff...do NOT waste your time,"This is a 700 page book of absolute junk.I'm very experienced with AD and had hoped that this book would focus on the specifics of the design aspects and prepare me for the test. Quite simply, it did not. This book simply glosses over general concepts and contains MAYBE 5% hard infromation you'll need to know for the exam. Bleh. I want my money back.If you're looking for a serious study guide, ditch this and go with examcram or heck...go with anything else besides this. In contrast the Exam Cram 2 book was VERY helpful and gave me many details that definately helped on the test."
4,Intermediate level,"El nivel de esta coreografia es intermedio, no avanzado. De todas maneras me gusto la coreografia aunque es un poco ""cuadrada"". Lo que mucha gente dice de Rania es cierto, es un poco rigida (stiff) le falta fluidez en sus movimientos, ademas a veces explica los pasos de una manera y los termina haciendo de otra!De todas formas yo me diverti mucho con el dvd! y logre sacar algunas ideas de el."
1,AWFUL,"there's got to be more rating options besides stars -- because this is a bomb. It deserves not even one star. Miss Rania is mighty stiff for a dancer. I don't know anything about the Egyptian style or any particular style except for jazz fusion, but after seeing the professionalism in Gothic Belly Dance, you'd think she's a novice. Her costume is just as bad, and her arm movements remind me of John Trovolta in Saturday Night Fever. Someone who may be limited in mobility will be pleased with this DVD / dancer; for anyone who can move without a walker, this is excruciating."
2,"Great concept, but...","This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well. I took it back to the store and they marked it as ""defective"". For a few dollars more, I got the ""Healthy Care Booster Seat"" from Fisher Price. I've had much better luck with it."
4,Love it so much getting another,"I've had one of these booster seats for years. This design has worked so well for our growing family, I'm looking for another. I've used this seat for three children now and need another to accomodate a fourth child. I'm not sure I've ever used the tray. I just push my boys right up to the table. I particularly like the fact that is has three height levels. The only thing I don't like is when I put it in the dishwasher it gets water inside the pieces. I put a towel under the seat to absorb the leaking water. The seat stays together so well, I have a hard time taking it apart to put it in the dishwasher."
4,"Funny, and wonderful to see Edward G. Robinson in this kind of role","Very funny, sometimes silly, with a great Edward G. Robinson performanceas a gangster tries to go straight at the end of prohibition, turning his brewery(which happens to make awful tasting beer) legit.Edward G. Robinson seems to be having the time of his life,and a lot of the supporting cast are very strong.Full of very funny lines, and clever twists. Based on a Damon Runyon play.Very worth a viewing."
5,Brings me so much joy every time I look at it!,"FLCL is may favorite anime, so this was an easy choice when looking for something to decorate my room. It's big, but not too big, so it fits just right. The image is bright and overall quality is excellent. If you love FLCL like me, GET THIS WALL SCROLL! :)"
4,"good statisticians, pretty good writers","This one is a book for the Sabermetrically inclined who already have a background in stats. In the first couple of chapters, the authors review some basic concepts through the lens of baseball before getting into some deeper analyses. To be honest, there's nothing in here that you can't get in Baseball Between the Numbers (although to the authors' credit, this book predates BBTN by 6 years) but it's a decent starter's guide. Worth the read, although those with a background in Sabermetrics will probably want to pass."
3,"good, but scuffs on face",Easy to use. No problems using it in the pool and the shower. Band is durable. My only complaint is that the face has gotten very scuffed and the marks are nearly impossible to rub off.
5,Thank You Friends!,You told that this CD was used but is 100% new! I'm so grateful ...You did send a wonderful product arrived before time!perfect service and gentle care with us. May God remain blessing You all.
3,"Great music, poor recording","These songs take me back to my beginnings as a Christian. They're great. My wife, who has only been a Christian for 17 years, agrees. My only complaint is with the quality of the recording. The signal is weak, requiring a much higher volume setting on my amp than is typical, and the recording sounds rather tinny, like an AM radio broadcast."
5,Still the greatest,"30 years later, this is still some of the best contemporary Christian music ever. I had much of his music on record albums and have wanted a good CD recording of it for years. Now I have it!"
5,A never ending ministry,"God brings certain people into this world for a reason. Keith Green didn't leave his own mark, but delivered God's timeless message through his music. Through his musical ministry you can feel his passion and love for Christ is real. He believed what he said and practiced what he preached. Every time I listen to his music, I feel his energy and passion for God and can't help but be touched my it. The difference is, the music and words make me think of Christ and his selfless love for the world. It isnlt just another ""hey that's a great song."" There is substance and meaning. I can't help but think that this God fearing and exceptional man was taken home so soon because our heavenly father felt this world wasn't good enough for such a devoted Christian. His work will live on because it is God's will."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY!!!,SOME DISCS WERE BLANK. THIS SET HAD TO BE RETURNED. NEVER DID GET A REPLACEMENT FOR BORDER INCIDENT AS ALL OF THE REPLACEMENT SETS THE DISC WAS BLANK.
3,Noir 3 Collection,"Border Incident and Lady in the Lake are particularly important films in the noir tradition. Though they are all B films, Lady carries the imprint of Raymond Chandler.The collection is worth having if one is interested in studying noir films, but don't expect any great films here...or even really good ones."
4,'film noir' at it's best,"I have all the collections so far and have enjoyed all tremendously. You have great actors and good story lines - these were considered our ""B"" movies when I was young (I'm 60 yrs. old) and remember most of them. Good entertainment and great to see all these old stars. I love ""film noir"" and am looking forward to more collections."
1,"What happened to very first review, even though it was negative?","When this box set first was released, there was a reviewer that stated that he had only seen one of these films so far, His Kind Of Woman, and he said that the sound was very low and hard to hear, and that there was a vertical line that ran on screen during the Vincent Price shoot out with the gangster for about five minutes of the picture. He was very unimpressed, and he would add further reviews of the other titles once he watched them. I wonder what happened to this FIRST review, and where are his follow up reviews of the other titles????"
5,An excellent read!,"This novel is a great read for anyone who has an interest in becoming a pilot, whether its to fly the line, or just getting your private license. Throughout the story, i felt like i was riding along in the jumpseat for his entire life. I could feel the gray hairs growing at the end of the novel, and I enjoyed it!"
4,What the title suggests,This was my first contact with Brysk's work and I found it somewhat challenging to take in in the short amount of time I alloted to it but it has some good ideas. Consider Purchasing this if you have time to read it..
1,Review,"The box said ""Great Movie themes"" but inside the box were 3 totally unrealted CDs of classical music and once you open the box you can't return it. Beware."
4,Great Game,A must have for anyone who likes racing games. This game brings back memories of the old CART schedule and the venues they used to race at.
2,"Fun, but hard and messy.","It's okay for a racing game, since it is old and was cool back then, but actually racing was a little difficult and gets rather akward for it is easy to spin around and can frustrate the even th calmest people in the world. This is more for hardcore Indy fans. It's a little loud, but next time just go to a real indy track and watch the action, or get a better Racing game."
2,Buy as MP3's or don't get the album at all.,"I listened to the sample of ""Jingle Bells"" and it sounded exactly what I was looking for in a child friendly version. However I can't use it at home. This CD prevents you from listening to any of the songs on a computer. In this day and age where you spend the money to purchase a CD you expect to be able to move the music you purchased to a MP3 player. So buy the music listed here as MP3s or don't bother. Caveat emptor indeed."
2,A Textbook,"Although this book is undeniably thoroughly researched, I must agree with some of the other reviewers on here in that this a dry, dull overview of what was a fascinating time. By the end of the book you will have very little idea of what life was like, on a personal level, for people living during these days. Having grown up with grandparents who were young adults during the 30s, I can categorically state that there are many fascinating tales to tell of these decades - this book provides none of them, and most frustrating of all provides no material not readily available elsewhere."
4,Daily Life review,"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great DepressionThis is a well-done book. I study this period of US history and find this book an excellent part of that journey."
3,Dye,The red wasn't as dark as I thought it would be more lighter.The color was okay I did use it and does have a good wash out affect.
3,Overview,"The pace of these videos is quite leisurely. If you are at all impatient you will find that you are fast forwarding a lot. I did enjoy the scenes of Paris and visually revisiting some of the places I'd walked past while at the museum.If you are looking for a slow-paced explanation and are not that interested in knowing exactly which paintings/statues you are viewing then this might be for you. If you want a ""tour"" of the Louvre, consider other options.These comments are about the second video: Selected Places.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Poor Quality,"I received this and found that I can't plug it into the wall and the computer at the same time, according to the instructions. I also found that the connector slid down into the housing after using it only 2 days. Now it won't connect at all. I am currently requesting a refund and will try the Palm Cradle instead."
4,"AMAZING show, but......","I love Daria soooooooo much! I know what you're thinking. Then what the ""but....."" about? Well I waited a week for it to get here and it cost me a good 30 bucks, and it was also from my christmas money. And then, I take it out of the package and the cover's all messed up! I know, I know. Not a big deal, I can live with it. But, if that wasn't enough, I open it so my dad and I can watch some together and the things that hold the discs? Are completely broken! They fell out completely!!!!! The only reason I'm not upset enough to kill amazon is that the show is priceless. The best show in the world. And I'm not being sarcastic."
5,The best thing to come out of MTV,"This is one of the best shows MTV ever made. I love the realistic sarcasm. This is not for young kids though, teens and up."
2,"Show is great; product, not so much","5 stars for the show itself.-0.5 star for failing to mention on the outside of the product--*before* people buy it--that all of the songs have been replaced.-1 star for not even springing for plot-relevant songs such as R.E.M.'s ""Everybody Hurts""-1 star for no episode guide.-0.5 star for unskipable previews. I didn't pay fifty dollars to be forced to watch advertisments of Beavis and Butthead."
5,"Good, but for the music","I just got my copy. As I opened it, I noticed that there is a note on the inside of the set from series creator Glenn Eichler describing the wonders of this box. However, he also details its horror, and that is that ""99% of the music has been changed, because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years did).""Now, if you're a die-hard Daria fan like myself, this will discourage and upset you, but will not keep you from owning and enjoying this wondrous box set. It looks great, it sounds great, and the extras are awesome. But it won't be exactly the way I remember it. It will be a new way to experience Daria. Maybe not the most authentic, but it's as close as we're going to get."
3,"Great tv show, review is for the packaging","Great tv show, happy it's on dvd. However my one picky complaint is that there is no episode guide, not even a list of which episodes are on which disc. I have to look online to figure out what disc an episode is on, what an episode is about."
4,The best for any fan of Daria,"If you love Daria this is a must have. What could be better than remember all her episodes, all her famous quotes and get back 10 years ago to enjoy of the classic stereotypes that you used to find when you were young. Definitely this is not for today's young guys. This is for people who enjoyed to belong to some group and immediately identify with any of the characters.The only thing that I'm missing is the original music. This boxset does not have the original songs that we used to hear, which was an important part of the series. It is understandable because it would make it impossible to have all the permissions and definitely it would be very expensive. However the way the created the generic music for each scene is almost as good as in the original. If you were not like a fan you'd probably won't notice it.I'm giving it 4 stars because i consider myself as a very good fan and I do miss the original music."
3,Great Series,"Love this series, it was one of MTV's last great shows before it became the Reality TV show channel.Every episode is great, I love Daria's and Jane's sense of humor.I didn't mind the lack of licensed music in the series with the exception of two. In the episode ""Road Worrier"" the replacement of REM's song ""Everybody Hurts"" just doesn't find the scene when they're in a traffic jam similar to the music video for ""Everybody Hurts"".The same can be said for the episode ""Quinn the brain"" where the song that replaced ""What do you want from me"" didn't fit. The original song was perfect to convey Daria's feeling of losing her identity for being a brain to Quinn who manages to be a popular brain. This plays while Daria is about to give Quinn a taste of her own medicine as Daria has a montage of changing into an similar to Quinn's normal look.Aside from these two scenes this was a perfect collection of a hilarious series."
1,Daria: The Abridged Animated Series,"To the executives - I will not buy TV shows that do not include the original music. If Freaks and Geeks can do it, you can. If I really have to see it I can buy it used so that my local music store gets the money and not you..."
3,Okay Show,"After watching this show for awhile, Daria becomes a little boring to watch. Her voice sounds depressing at times along with the sarcasm, but I guess that's what some people like about her character. Some of the episodes I've watched have been funny, but after listening to her for awhile, I need a break. Back then, this show was funnier to me than now. Sometimes that happens when you watch a show a few years ago, and then re-watch them years later. There's been alot of talk about the music changes, but for me, this is not an issue. I think one will still enjoy this show. So far, the dvds have worked and shown great as well. For all that comes with this set, the price is reasonable. It's also great that it came with eight separate discs instead of two-sided discs."
3,"Where is the episode ""Daria""","After waiting forever I'm disapointed they said this was a complete collection, but it is missing episode one from season 3 which was titled ""Daria"" it was a musical episode of daria and they went strait from the last episode of season 2 two the second episode of season three titled ""through a lens darkly"" why is it advertised as a complete series when ""Daria"" isn't included?"
1,Copy protection restricts stops DVD from working on some computers,"I thought I would purchase these DVDs to relive a series from when I was younger.The problem is that I can't play these discs on my computer, since I don't use Windows or Mac. When I try to play the DVD with MPlayer (on a linux machine) nothing happens. I have tried numerous other players on this machine, and other machines and still have similar problems.I was able to play the discs on a friends Mac using the Apple DVD Player, but don't think I should have to purchase a new DVD player/computer just so I can watch these discs."
1,No Music is a No Buy,"With out the Music of the times Daria is a drag, evan Daria would say that this is just Depressing. Do not buy with out the real sound track. This was the same thing that was done to China Beach. Some shows are the Music and the Music is that extra part of the show."
5,We Want Daria On DVD!,"Like others have said, I too am waiting for the day when MTV/Viacom/whoever owns the rights now, gets a clue and releases this show out on DVD!Nothing new to say, I just want to add my name to the list of folks who will rush out to buy the complete series whenever it's released. So, MTV/Viacom/whoever owns the rights now, please take notice!"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME AND LONG OVERDUE~,It will be refreshing to revisit the Daria perspective again. All these reality shows are overrated. Can't wait to get my copy!
4,Long awaited but slightly disappointing,"I have been waiting for Daria to come out on DVD since it went off the air. I was ecstatic when I read that years of waiting whad finally paid off. However, the wonderful DVD set was tainted by the fact that MTV had no retained the rights to all the music in Daria. My main bone of contention is that the theme song is included in a small handful of episodes. Somehow, this small omission took away from the total experience. Otherwise, the episodes were exactly as I remembered them: bitingly sarcastic and something I could relate to."
3,24 carat electro-plated,"After years of waiting, for one of the best shows MTV ever will produce, I received my complete animated series of daria. The container is sturdy enough to survive the USPS, but I really was disappointed with the DVD's. Not the content, daria is pure gold, the DVD'S are obviously the cheapest quality that can be made. I have bought DVD+R in packs of one hundred at Pay Day for ten denars that were a better quality. For $49.00 semoliens, you'd think that MTV would have sprung for a higher quality disc for their programming.By all means purchase daria, just be very careful when touching the DVD's."
3,Like cake without icing,"Yes, it's Daria as we remember her. Yet, it is like cake without the icing without the music. It amazes me that the music industry seems to want to exterminate itself and blame others for its failure. This is a huge missed opportunity to sell many songs or a equally monumental soundtrack. Yet, people will not buy what they cannot hear. It could have been a revival for many 90s artists to a new generation. I suppose in the name of copyright, the powers that be want to keep the songs to themselves. Yes, I am glad it has been released, but ironically it portrays what a Sick Sad World we have become."
5,The best american animated series?,"Any high schooler with (at least) half a brain should enjoy this show. It is funny, intelligent and original. One wonders how such a show ended up on MTV but, then again, there are also get great shows on FOX... The world is full of contradictions. The fact that the music is different doesn't matter at all because this show remains just as enjoyable (if not more)."
5,Missed the music,Series is great as I remembered. I did miss some of the music that appeared in the original shows. They offered something about extra fees to be paid to get permission. OH WELL it was only 30 seconds out of each episode.
5,Very happy!,It came in very quickly and I am very happy with the product. It is a christmas present to my daughter who has been wanting the series for awhile. I even got it for a discount.
4,Great throwback to years past,"Everyone and their mother already know about the music issue with this series - MTV couldn't get it, they're not there, we cope.To me, while the music was awesome and really just underlined what Daria was as a series, it's not a deal breaker. I love these DVDs almost as much as if the music had been there - the characters, humor, and funny plot lines are still there and definitely worth a second, third, and fourth watch. This is one of the all-time greatest things that ever came from MTV, and if there were more series like this one aired on TV today, I'd probably watch a lot more.As it is, I'll deal with it by putting on some Daria when the world just becomes too annoying - this was the first show that taught me that it's okay being different; it's even preferable, even if it is hard sometimes. This series serves to remind me of this and helps me celebrate it."
4,Great Boxset - even without the original music,"Having watched five seasons of Dawson's Creek with some alternate theme music - I am pretty use to being manipulated by the tv execs. The DVD Boxset has all the episodes as well as the movies. Sure, it would be nice to hear some of my favorite songs but again - went through it with many other boxsets - not surprised they did it to this one too."
4,Great Set,"This is a great set. The video quality is great, and the show is still entertaining. I would have enjoyed a documentary featurette, but otherwise the extras were pretty cool. The set even includes the two Daria TV movies (although I would prefer that ""Is It Fall Yet?"" was on the disk with season 4, since it originally aired between season 4 and 5."
1,EDITED VERSION.. BUT SAYS ITS COMPLETE,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO ORDER DARIA, I REMEMBER WATCHING IT BACK WHEN MTV WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD CHANNEL,SO WHEN I BOUGHT THIS I WAS SO EXCITED FOR IT TO ARRIVE, LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT ALL THE MUSIC WAS GONE, AND THAT THE EPISODESARE IN FACT NOT COMPLETE AS IT STATES ON COVER OF THE DVD. THE 8 SET DVD COLLECTION HAS A INSERT FROM THE SHOWS CREATOR GLENN EICHLER WHO LETS YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT THE COMPLETE SERIES YET AN EDITED VERSION. SO I SAY THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT THAT IS AS IT STATES, IT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT IS IS COMPLETE, AND FOR THE FANS WHO WATCHED THE SHOW WHEN IT AIRS WE KNOW PARTS THAT ARE MISSING.. SHAME ON PARAMOUNT, AND AMAZON, AND MTV."
3,"Love Daria, but where's the music?","I received my Daria DVD today and I was excited to finally get it. I read the little paper inside the set which explained why the music is gone. 99% of the music is gone, what a big let down! I really loved the music as it was a huge part of the show. I'm happy that I can now watch Daria but it's so incomplete with out the music that fit the theme of each scene. I'm hoping that eventually they will be able to release the DVD in its original format. But for now this will do.I had never seen the first episode of the series and today I was able to. Which finally killed my curiosity. I've been watching each episode all afternoon and most of the evening, but I can't get over that the music is gone."
2,Disappointed,"Couldn't wait till the release of Daria, finally the wait was over, all of us fans rejoiced, until I received my copy this week and discovered ALL of the music from the show scrapped!!!, What a let down!, the same show, but no music so upset, to me this wasn't even worth buying, I should have transfered my videos to dvd, and not wasted my time, to the show's creator, what have you done?, it's like taking all the music and music videos out of Beavis And Butthead and replacing with classic music, and making the tv series Glee about a highschool chess club, can we say BORING!!! and so disappointing, you've ruined this for all us hard core fans, I hope everyone else comes to their senses and returns their copies for refunds, it's simply NOT worth buying! Every dvd sold should have been told this BEFORE people ordered this, not After, the dvd should be recalled and be replaced with the original music that made people watch the show."
5,Fantastic!!,"One of my best purchases in a long time! For the price, it is completely worth it. The video quality is superb. At times it can be a little grainy, but this is to be expected from DVDs. Even though they replaced the real music due to licensing, the stock music works very well. This box set is fantastic."
4,daria dvd set,"i <3 daria! the only thing that would make this better would be if all the original music was in the dvds, but i understand the cost associated with doing that would have been astronomical for the company. and besides, i bought it so i could watch my favorite sarcastic cartoon character, not watch music videos. also greath that both of the full length movies are included. this brings me back to high school! :)"
4,Sound is TERRIBLE,"The show is as amazing as it always was, but the sound on the DVD set keeps going in and out. Though they say they ""changed"" most of the music, they really just removed most of it."
3,Daria!,"An alltime favorite of 90's MTV cartoons.The script is psycologicaly intresting,it brushes on the topic of morbid humor, and reflects an intresting dynamic of teenage life. Understanding Daria and her unpunful jokes can be quite difficult. The conotations and understory create a intresting conversation topic in tv programming.The show brought new artiscal views that persepcitlvely hadn't been seen on television.Final Say- A recommend prescription for outsourcing teens.Not the best, but worth a watch."
5,Love this series,This show brings back a lot of fond memories and I look forward to sharing both the show and the memories with my daughter when she gets older.
5,my daughter is happy,"She loves daria and this shipment was the right price, arrived on time and in good shape. Would purchase from this seller again."
4,A quick review.,"The DVD box is really well put together, and seems like it won't fall apart when you touch it. The episodes are clear and are a nice change from the crappy youtube quality that we have been forced to watch until now. After a few minutes into the first episode i began to notice the music is different, after 2 episodes it is very obvious and a little annoying. (Amazing how greed almost stopped this show from coming to DVD, but with a little change in music the series is finnaly here.) As a daria fan i want to give it 5 stars but due to the music changes and the episodes not being fully intact i leave it with 4. If your new to Daria you won't notice. But if you watched the show when it aired then you'll know what i mean. Still it's better to have something rather then nothing. Long live Daria!"
4,Great!,"It's an excellent series. I strongly recommend it! I used to watch this series when I was little, so this gives me a lot of nostlagic memoriesI just wish it has subtitles in other languages"
4,Daria-The Complete Series,I knew this Series from MTV back in the 90's. It is a great series. The only disadvantage is that is they still working with the DVD Region Code. Why? This Series is from the 90's!
4,Great Show!,I used to watch Daria growing up and I love the series. There's so many episodes on each disc and the movies are even included. I got this for a great price and wish the show would come back to MTV.
5,My Fav Show!~,"What can i say about this other than AMAZING. Daria is hilarious with its dry humor and witty sarcasm. Expect to laugh with each episode! All episodes included, both movies, and a couple other extras. Just plain perfect! :D"
3,Wow...way to skimp on packaging,"Did they really need to use packaging almost identical as the bootleg copies out there? Also, with no chapter page or booklet with this set, and just a little ""note"" about the music, I am pretty disappointed. My Dr. Katz complete set came with a nice booklet about the characters and episodes. I guess I expected the Daria set to be just as carefully put together.Im still glad to own a legit copy of the episodes, as they're smart and funny and just as entertaining now as before. I guess Ill just hope for a re-release set later or something :)"
3,If you buy from MTV.../ very disapointed,"Finally, I've been waiting for this DVD a long time.Yay! Anyway, MTV has patterned with Amazon to create a great deal for serious Daria fans. If you buy from the MTV site, you can receive a free limited edition Daria t shirt with purchase and get free shipping all through amazon. However there is a catch, there is a limited number of t shirts so don't wait to long to buy. Now for the disappointing part. All the music has been changed BUMMER! I have to say its definitely not the same, I'm not sure I'd recommend this unless you're a die hard Daria fan."
3,No subtitles or other languages,"Ive been waiting for this product for a very long time. Im very happy to have it, although English is the only language available and no subtitles either"
4,Smart and Funny,"It`s strange, when I was in high school I didn`t like this show. Now the more I watch it, and relate to it, the more I like it. This was an excellent buy. I could not be more happy with it."
5,So excited!!,"Finally!!! I waited so long for this show to come to DVD and now it's finally out! Yes, it's true that a lot of the music from the show has been changed due to licensing, but it hasn't changed the integrity of the show! Take the good with the bad - it's finally on DVD! 26 hours of a great show, it's awesome!"
3,Soundtrack deleted,"Back on the 90's I was a great fan of the series, mostly because of the soundtrack featured in the series which included many songs from popular bands and artists.I was very disappointed to find out that the original soundtrack has been deleted and replaced with an new ""generic"" soundtrack.On the other hand there's no subtitles (not even in English) and no Spanish dub. If you happened to watch the series in both English and Spanish, this is quite a letdown.Despite all the niggles, the presentation is vey good and it's a great opportunity to enjoy Daria's trademark sarcasm all over again and remember those days when MTV was a cool music channel before it turned itself into a reality show network."
5,"Here you go, I guess","The series is just as fantastic as I remember it to be. Everyone pretty much knows the whole backstory of Daria so I'm just going to talk about the packaging.Really MTV?! You approved the presentation of this iconic show? The packaging is flimsy and just straight up cheap looking. The only thing it comes with is a little bio on the back about the show. While the disks each have a colorful character design, it is still sad to open it up after waiting for days for Amazon to deliver it, only to be left scratching your head going ""is this a bootleg???"" Because thats exactly what it looks like: a cheap bootleg copy bought from a toothless street vendor.I guess we should just stop complaining and be thankful it got released on DVD at all, right?"
4,Better than the bootleg,"Although the dimension of the thoughtfully and artfully selected original music samples is missing, the presence of all those censored little scenes and the extras that were missing from the syndicated broadcasts (that were hacked into the bootleg set) make up for it.This is a full quality studio release, and I am happy to have it. But had they offered it with all those hard-to-license tracks, I'd have willingly paid $15-20 more for the set."
4,Daria the Complete Series,"I love my DVDs!! I bought it via a deal MTV did that allowed the purchase of the Daria Complete Series DVDs and the t-shirt for the total of $50. The problem was that I had to do 2 separate orders--1 for the shirt and 1 for the DVDs. Though I love both the shirt and the DVD, I was not happy with the customer service I received from Amazon about the issue."
3,too small,"zegna products are great quality, but their sizes dont run true. a 2x on me is like a large. just way too tight."
1,Tabloid,"This book, even if partially true was clearly written with the intent to sensationalize and entertain. Most polygamists are simply consenting adults with a different lifestyle. There are more polygamists in every society than there are in mormonism, even today. With this book clearly intended to entertain others in a lewd exposition should it be any wonder that it is mostly composed of exaggerations and fabrications? If you want a sick tabloid of abuse to read go ahead and buy it, but if you are looking for the facts of a minority lifestyle look somewhere else. look at principle voices, or tapestry against polygamy, and you may get an accurate picture of what is really going on. Of course there is some abuse in every community in America, but this book attempts to paint an entire faith with the satin of a few sensationalized vignettes."
3,Looking into a secret world,"This book takes a look into the subject of women in polygamist relationships. While it's very important that these fundamentalist groups be seriously looked into, the writing style and spelling/grammatical errors were hard to take. I wasn't looking for sensationalist yellow journalism type writing, but something more than the stiff and soulless narrative would have vastly improved the readability of this book."
2,Interesting subject but poorly written,This book was hard to follow because the author is not a good writer. It's too bad because this subject fascinates me and I have read quite a lot about it. I don't recommend this book.
2,"Sticks are fine, but dip tears off in pieces and becomes uncomfortable","In general, the sticks are fine, and when the rubberized dip is new, it feels good and definitely improves your grip.However, when the dip starts breaking down, it starts tearing off in multiple places, which makes the sticks very uncomfortable to hold. I'm an amateur player, and I play between one to two hours a week with these, tops. They broke down after six months, which works out to somewhere between 25 and 50 hours of play.I only use these sticks to play on an electronic Roland kit, so the sticks have never come into contact with a metal rim.I would recommend any number of other sticks that have a ""tack"" grip instead of a rubberized grip."
1,Not for everyone -- I returned it.,"I was disappointed, after reading all the 5-star reviews, to discover that these recipes are full of Dr. Atkins Bake Mix and Sugar Twin (both of which I find inedible), and crushed pork rinds (which she uses frequently as a seasoning and filler). There is a nasty-sounding recipe for Sweet and Sour Chicken that's made with Sugar Twin -- aren't there enough low- or no-carb ways to prepare chicken without resorting to this? If you want natural-tasting recipes made with ""real"" food, or if you don't eat pork products, this is not the book you're looking for."
3,too large scale.,"All of the recipes make servings of 12 or more, this is great if a family is on this plan but, i'm just one person and the recipes cannot be broken down for my use. Would love a book of recipes for one or two."
2,Read before you buy this book!!!!,"This book should have been titled, ""Eat Yourself Thin, by Eating Tons of Pork Rinds"". So many recipes call for pork rinds--yuck!! I understand that the Atkins diet uses them a lot, but this book calls itself a ""low carb cookbook"", not an ""exclusive Atkins cookbook"". Very misleading. I won't use crushed up pig fat--not very healthy!!!!!"
5,I love this cookbook!,"I purchased this cookbook because I was eating the same things over and over on my low carb diet. This got boring and I began to cheat. Once you start cheating it becomes easier to bend the rules more often and suddenly you are putting some weight back on.This cookbook got me back on track because it is full of great recipes for food we already eat. Stuffed peppers, meatloaf, meatballs, teriyaki chicken wings, soups, and pancakes (yes-pancakes!). You don't have to be an experienced cook to follow her recipes and she uses primarily ""normal"" ingredients that you can purchase at the grocery store. The few special items are used in very small quantities.I've tried several recipe books and this is by far my favorite."
3,Have access to a good health food store?,"The recipes sound delicious, but I was dissapointed in not being able to find the ingredients. I only have access to a small health food store and grocery stores. I was not able to find guar gum anywhere and many of Nancy's recipes call for it. This cookbook is better than Dr. Atkin's, in which many ingredients are impossible to find. I would still only recommend it if you have access to a very large well-stocked health food store or are willing to pay for shipping for ingredients ordered online."
4,Smooth Jazz,Anything by Kim Waters is good. I'm looking forward to somemore Streetwize compilations. Its been too long.
4,This book should be made an optional reading for in undergraduate computer science student,"I agree with the other reviewers. In general this is good book. It bridges the gaps between many computer science disciplines. Especially OS and programming language. It also touched a little bit on computer architecture and linking process. The text was written in a a very clear way. However, I do have two complains. The author didn't spend enough effort on the relatively more complex and advanced topics. Eg, linking process for C++, advanced topics in memory leakage detection and prevention. On the other hand, author spent too much energy describing linked data structure in terms of serialization. I personally don't think its relevance is higher than the advanced memory leakage issues. For seasoned profressionals, this book can be used to refresh your knowledge. It is a beginner level to intermediate level book."
4,Excellent book on memory use for any programmer,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague at work; I'm really glad I listened to his recommendation. While I've been programming in C/C++ since 1990 (other languages for two decades before then) I found the concepts/ideas put forward in this book to be very useful in improving my memory use habits. No matter how well you think you know memory management, you can learn something from this book. I only omit one star because some of the examples were not as clear as they could have been."
5,Rare book,"Excellent coverage of all the memory routines. Lucid explanation but could have added a few more illustrations. Nevertheless, a book that which must be read by all professional C & C++ programmers."
2,"The book has little theory, and talks more about implementation details than anything else.",I bought this book thinking I would get more insight about memory models in C and C++ languages. And how memory is a different resource. With its typed and untyped properties. With discussions about C++ RAII etc.I was very disappointed to find out that this book is actually an weak explanation of how compilers implement the object model.
5,Nasty big pointy teeth!,"This item has 2 side effects...1: One can't help but laugh when wearing this item on one's hand (I've got my hand up a rabbits butt!)2: One can't help but quote from Monty Python And The Holy GrailVery similar to the Tim The Enchanter hat...Not for children! Once they find out the bunny is to attack, well, they take it as leave to attack everyone and everything in site. Funny while you are not being attacked but once the attack does come, not so much.Either way, loads of fun! Lots of laughs!"
3,Not only shotguns,"My maine objection for the otherwise great documentary is that the director focuses only in the relationship between shotguns, namely criminal activities, and that especific colombian regional music."
3,not bad,"its not really about colombia and its music as a whole but more about a town under direct drug trade influence that looses its culture to guns,cars,greed and money.all musical performances are basically played by the musicians of that town.no mention of lucho bermudez,pastor lopez..anythingif u got $15 or so dollars to spare then fine"
1,lousy interface,"I am very unhappy with this Linksys product, who I have always had good luck in the past. It has a very bad ""wizard"" interface that will not let you print any other way except using this interface. I could not connect through the wizard (despite being able to connect through the ""secret"" web interface) and was unable to use this device. I'm very knowledgable about print servers and networking and have never had an issue setting them up before this (I have two other network servers in my house already). I recommend a different brand."
1,Does not work with Vista,"I purchased this wireless print server to work with a new laptop using Windows Vista. I was told by linksys that this product would work with Vista. The tech support has worked very hard with me, however after several attempts have not been able to solve the issue. I am still unable to print with this product."
2,Cisco-Linksys Wireless-G Print Server with Multifunction Printer Support,"I thought I would love this product but unfortunately I don't even know if it works...Linksys has not written a driver for Windows 7 yet. It should have been a perfect match for my Brother Multifunction Laser Printer/Copier/Scanner but non the less, I must still take my laptop into the rooom were the multfunction is and plug in the USB cable to print..."
1,"Doesn't support Windows 7, now more than 13 months since release of this OS","Why is it that Cisco/Linksys has taken this long to support Windows 7 customers, given that Windows 7 has been on the market for more than a year. Tech support can give no guidance to when the driver will be ready. Totally unacceptable in my view."
1,Don't Buy this if you use Windows 7,"Windows 7 is not supported. When I contacted Cisco support I was told they are working on the drivers. They pointed me to a Cisco Webpage that no longer exists and then told me to keep checking back for the drivers to be available. This is an operating system that has been available for 10 months and Cisco does not have drivers? On top of it all, I waited online for 10 minutes before I was able to Live chat with someone and I had to ask my question five time before they responded. They then responded with a message to check the website that was nonexistent and then would not respond to any more of my questions."
2,Not compatible- had to return it,"OK, it isn't really the print server's fault, or Linksys. Just not compatible with anything but the latest multifunction printers that follow some kind of announcement protocol to identify themselves on USB.I had to reflash the access point just to connect to this thing - that was some work, let me tell you. Make sure you write down ALL the settings before doing that!Linksys phone support was unhelpful, but their web chat support (IE only) was great, and worked the problem with me until there was really nothing left to try."
2,No vista support,Returned it. Wouldn't work with Vista and a Canon MP780 and it certainly won't work with Mac OS X clients (note: the product doesn't advertise support for Mac).Why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers?
1,WPSM 54G print Server,"Dont waste your money. After several hours, I was unable to connect it to the network. The PDF manual and the instructions offer no subtantial help except for most basic issues. Waitng times for phone help in excess of an hour, still did not get it to work. From others review, it seems if it goes well is easy, but any dificulty and you are on your own."
1,Lots of Problems,Just a heads up on this item. It has never worked correctly. Starts out working find and quits. You will find many negative reviews online.
3,Print server,"Good quality, works just like it said it would, shipped the next day, Great price compared to on line stores. Only prints of one pc. Thank you"
1,Cannot force to work,"Waste many time to configure this device.Cannot.WiFi connected but cannot print. Cannot install second part of setup (""Computer setup"").Windows 7 incompatible.I try many ways to configure remote printer manually (standart tcp-ip port, LPR printing as adviced official web site and others). All is failure.I cannot change firmware, because it changing only in ""ethernet mode"", but I cannot reach device in ethernet mode. Only at WiFi I see it's web interface. Reset does not help.There are many problems with this device in internet I found out, but there are not decisions.Not advice to anybody.Just money to the wind!"
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7,Warning! This print server is not compatible with Windows 7 and LinkSys has not said when a driver will be made available.
1,Nothing but trouble,Had this for few years. Hassle to setup. Often would not connect till fiddle with it. Now with new router can't get it working after 3 hours of trying everything. Downloadable update crashes. Level 1 tech support put me on hold for level 2. After 23 minutes I gave up. Do not buy this product.
2,This Product DOES NOT Work with 64 Bit Windows Vista,"Unless I missed it there was no mention of operating system compatability, so I wrongly assumed that it would work with 64 bit Windows Vista. The product would have done exactly what I wanted but I ordered it, it arrived, and after scratching my head as to why my PC couldn't find the print server even after following the setup instructions to the letter, I finally got onto Cisco's live chat and spoke to a rep. As soon as I told him I was running 64 bit Vista, he immediately said that none of their products were supported by 64 bit Vista. UGH! Would have been nice to know that before buying this!Amazon, please update this advertisement to add the operating systems this product is compatable with. I have been pleased with every purchase I've made from Amazon until now."
3,Works well if you upgrade firmware and use latest drivers.,Purchased unit online after a lot of research regarding compatibility with XP and Vista. Have desktop PC in office area running Vista and numerous laptops running XP. Unit arrived with old version of firmware. Installation CD was also not latest version. Installation was unable to complete as shipped. Suggest anyone who buys this unit does the following: 1. Visit Linksys site and download latest firmware. Follow instructions and upgrade firmware of unit. 2. Visit Linksys site and download latest drivers/install software. Copy extracted files to CD for install on computers. DO NOT USE CD THAT COMES WITH UNIT! Unit has worked very well since install.
1,Another linksys nightmare,"What is it with Linksys? I am told they are the best on the market, but none of their software works as advertised... you always have to patch firmware!Here I am day two trying to get a Mac and Windows Vista 64 to talk to this thing. ""Connect Fail"" and other meaningless messages abound.I understand that this works with Vista 32 or XP, but do not expect this thing to work out of the box."
1,Doesn't work with OS X,"Although I could get this to successfully print a test page from my MacBook Pro running 10.5.4, anything else I tried to print only resulted in blank pages. This is absolutely unacceptable and this product should embarrass the software developers at Linksys, especially with the high price tag this carries. I quickly returned the product and replaced it with a D-Link print server that works great from both Windows and Mac. I'm very disappointed with Linksys on this one, as I'm generally a fan of their products."
1,Don't buy with Vista,"I was on the phone with Linksys for 4 hours to set this thing up with my Brand New laptop that just so happens to be on their website to be capatible with Vista. Nope, right out of the rep's mouth and me spending 4 hours wasting my time and effort. Annoyed."
1,Server does not work as advertised!,"After many hours on the phone with Linksys, they finally admitted that the multifunction aspect of this server does not work. The server is supposed to allow print, scan and copy capabilities from all computers connected to the server. However the respresentative I spoke with at Linksys was not able to get these capabilities to work, or able to tell me how to get them to work, even after admitting that the printer I use is on the list of ""supported"" printers. Very disappointed with this purchase, and I will be returning it."
2,Good Luck with it,"I spent hours on tech support with Linksys, and was told to send it back: the product was defective. So I did, and Amazon gave a refund. I lost only my time."
1,If you have a Mac don't waste your money...,... because this device will not work with Apple computers. If there was an option to rate it 0 stars I would have.
2,needs bug spray,"After i installed this product I was happy with its ability to function with my multi function all in one, however this product for some reason unknown to me loses its ability to work wirelessly and i have to hard wire my all in one and shut down my network and redo the diagnostics and there is some problem with the ""printer driver"" even though my printer driver is up to date."
3,Difficult Self Setup,"I spent two hours trying to setup the print server. I was expecting difficulty based on other reviews on this site. I followed the directions exactly as it was explained, but couldn't get the print server working. I have yet to call Linksys customer support for help. I'm sure it will work just fine once I get it up and running."
3,Works as Advertised (most of the time),This is a brand new unit and one of the few print servers that will support All-in-one type devices. It works well except that every few days it hangs up and need to be powered off. I suppose Linksys will come out with a firmware upgrade to fix this.
1,Nice concept poor execution for multifunction capabilities,"Got this to use with an HP laser/fax/scanner multifunction printer to share between two computers. Don't waste your time with this unless all you want to do is use it strictly as a print server, no scanning. Just buy another multifunction printer and save yourself a lot of aggravation and time. Even though the printer I hooked it up to was listed as a supported printer, it would not work properly as a scanner on the remote computer. Plus you need to ""connect"" to the print server manually in order to scan even if you do get it working. Tech support was useless provided only rudimentary suggestions, as is typical, and was a further waste of time.On the other hand, Amazon provided exceptional service when I wanted to return it, and processed the return in record time."
3,Incompatible with Windows 7,"The Server installation went well, except to note that this device does not support 10 character ASCII WEP keys, so I had to change my network security settings - not a big deal since I wanted to upgrade to WPA-PSK anyway.Client installations with the CD Wizard went well in my XP computers. The big problem came when it came time to install the wireless print server client in my Windows 7 laptop. The wizard immediately displayed an error message ""OS not support"" (sic).Needless to say, I could not use this device."
3,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7,It worked with my old computer that had windows xp. I had no problems with it. I recently got a new computer with windows 7 and during the installation process it said that it wouldn't work with my OS. Just a warning to those with windows 7
2,"Warning: Does not Work for Macintosh, and problems with Vista as well","The setup was not difficult, and the server works generally well for my XP machine, but there is no Macintosh support. I shared the printer on the XP machine, but Mac still can't print to it--I get the error ""unsupported personality:PCL"" all day long. The product does not include software for the Macintosh.It is also expensive for what it is--a single port print server. Other users report problems with Vista.So you are better off buying a wireless printer. Lexmark makes these, and they support remote Macintosh printing. However the all-in-one models do not support remote scanning from a Macintosh, so beware."
2,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed with this Linksys product. I just couldn't get it to connect to my three PCs properly. I am not a neophyte and I thought the installation procedure should have gone without a hitch. But it didn't and I wish I had not purchased the product. I have had installation problems with other Linksys products, especially those wireless products for my 64-bit Vista OS. I didn't call tech support because I have trouble understanding the Indian techs, and I didn't want to spend two hours on the phone."
4,I love it,I bought this print server because I have a Canon MP530 and I love it. I had a print server before that would only allow me to print not scan or fax. It installed like a breeze on my XP machines but Vista proved a little trickier. I was on the chat with the tech and after an hour we got it to work very well. My little home office is humming along with my 3 laptops now able to print and scan. I am thrilled with it. I haven't figured out a way to fax wirelessly but that is my next task. I am really thrilled with it.
1,Check the compatibility list first!,"First purchase had a broken antenna so I exchanged it.Not sure where on the Web I found it but I checked the compatibility list for my HP LaserJet 3055 and it wasn't on it. The HP LaserJet 3050 is very similar and it is on the list so I hoped the 3055 would work. Wrong! The PrintServer could not match the driver for the 3055 with the printer it detected which was the 3055.Anyhow, I re-installed the driver several times and this product just doesn't work with the LaserJet 3055. Check the compatibility list before you purchase this product. I just ordered an HP Jetdirect ew2400 which is much more expensive but I'm hopeful that it will at least work."
1,Absolutely horrible device,"I don't always give only one-star to a product, but when I do, I give it to the Cisco-Linksys Wireless-G Print Server with Multifunction Printer Support... This product is bad from beginning to end. The setup is cumbersome and finicky. Once you plug the device, it will require constant reboots (I have one and access to two more, they all did that.) I have to reboot my device at least once, sometimes twice a day. What a horrible product. Stay away."
3,Look very closely at these first,"Unnecessarily difficult to get set up and working as it supports less than a plethora of printer models. Secondly and probably more importantly, while this is being sold through The Amazon Marketplace, and ieven on Cisco's own site, this is actually an old product. Perhaps five or more years. I would look for something newer and that played much nicer with newer routers and switches."
2,Not Worth It,"For the cost, you'd be better off buying a multifunction device with wireless or wired network capabilities built-in. While it might be tempting to want to save a few dollars (your old multifunction works great, but you want to share it), this device will cause you more frustration than it's worth. I set it up and successfully configured my Canon MP830 to use it, but sharing it with several computers requires you to take control of the device to initiate any action. Think if this less of a print server (which could take simultaneous requests from several computers) and more of a USB over ethernet adapter - you logically connect and disconnect from the device each time you want to use it and take exclusive control. Just a pain."
1,Epic Fail,"After multiple attempts to set up the server I returned it. The software refused to identify my printer, saying that I needed to install the drivers. However, since my printer worked fine without the server, I find that a bit hard to believe. Sorry Cisco, you're a no go."
1,Windows 7? Forget It,Linksys and Amazon both do a smooth job of hiding the fact that this thing is not compatible with Windows 7. If you are using W7 forget it.
1,Linksys Wireless G Print Server (not for Windows 7),"The big problem with this item is that it is not Windows 7 compatible. It may have been a great print server with Windows XP, but when you go to install the software on a Windows 7 computer, you receive a message saying the OS is not supported and, for most people, that is as far as you can go. I returned the item for a refund. As far as I can remember, I think that this is the first item I ever purchased from Amazon that I had to return."
1,printer router,Isn't compatible with Windows 7 and Cisco online chat didn't seem to have another suggested product. I just bought a new printer instead!
1,Warning - Windows Vista 64 bits,"After trying to install the Linksys WPSM54g wireless printserver without success, technical support at Linksys/Sysco informed me that the printserver may not be compatible with the Windows Vista 64 bit OS!I obviously cannot review the product any further."
1,Did not work with HP Officejet Pro 7680,"I had no luck with installing this wireless print server even after contacting Linksys tech support. I am fairly computer savvy and followed all instructions, downloaded firmware for my Linksys wireless router, contacted customer service and they wanted to charge me for help. No thanks!! I returned the ""POS"" Linksys print server and bought the HP Wireless G print server which installed stress-free. It was so easy--just install the CDROM and follow the instructions. I had all four of my laptops wirelessly printing in less than 30 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: Pass the Linksys print server by--get the HP Wireless G printer server if you have the same setup as I do (Windows XP, Vista, 7--HP OfficeJet Pro 7680 printer--Linksys wireless router) Good luck."
1,No support for Windows/7,Too bad you don't let the buyer know that this device has no support for W/7. Probably a good product but zero stars go to Amazon for performance.
1,Not compatible with Windows Vista,"This is not compatible with Windows Vista (which was released by Microsoft in 2006). The box clearly states that Windows Vista is not one of the compatible operating systems for the device. I had a buddy of mine (a software engineer) fiddle with it and try every which way to force it to work, but couldn't. Incompatibility with Windows Vista is a huge deal, and the seller should put that on the product info page (they did not).The redeeming quality of this device is that, had it worked, installation is a cinch. Just plug and go."
1,Total crap,This did not work at all. Total waste of money. Tech support could not resolve the problem and I wasted hours of my time trying hermit working on my very stable network.
2,Not worth the aggravation,Not worth the time or money. A pain to set up and wouldn't keep the printer connected. Kept dropping out of the network at random intervals. Returned for refund!
2,For experts only,"The installation software did not work as promised, and I had to uninstall and reinstall a few times in order to get the unit setup to the point where I could do a manual configuration of the printer in WinXP. If you are not fairly adept at Windows, you are going to be VERY frustrated. Also, you will lose the Scan and FAX features of your USB multifunction printer. Apparently, you can only make those work with a direct connection to the USB port."
3,"As other have said, setup is tricky!","I know a fair amount about networking and suffice to say that as others have stated, the setup is tricky. I had conflicting info from Linksys support about if it'd work with Windows 7. They started by saying it was not supported by Win 7 but in the end I fiddled enough with the Print Server and Router settings to get it to work. If you know what you are doing and have the patience, this will work. If you are a networking novice then I'd go a different route."
4,Good Bang for the Buck,"The setup is a pain since you have to pull the network cord and then pull the power, this is done a few times to set up the wired and then the wireless sections but for the money it's not too bad. There is monitoring software that needs to be installed with it and have it run in the background all the time, this needs to be installed on all the machines that are going to use it. Also, you need to have the driver for the printer(s) installed on each PC before installing the software to connect to the print server."
1,No 64bit OS support!,Unless you run only 32 bit OS or older DO NOT BUY. there is NO 64 bit support for vista or Mac OSX. lynksys tech help simply blames your existing hardware and tries to sell you a pay to repair tech service. DO NOT RECCOMEND to anyone not totally tech savvy as it took three tries to install and much configuration after it did install.
4,Good not great,Not easy to install even for IT pro. NOT for MAC or windows on MAC.Works as advertised but specific printers. READ the printer list.
1,"No IP printing, No Mac Support = big disappointment","For some reason, Linksys decided not to include IP printing support for this device. What a big disappointment. That means Windows ONLY. And where do thay state that??"
2,Two Problems Worth Mentioning,"I bought this printer server partly because of the good reviews here. It works well mostly, but I did encountered a few problems that I feel worth mentioning:1. The manual says Internet printing (LPR) is supported, but in fact it is not. The related settings mentioned in the manual do not exist in the web admin interface. I am referring to the sections ""Printer Tab -- Internet Printing"" and ""Printer Tab -- Logical Port"" in Charpter 6 of the manual.2. A more serious problem is that whenever my printer goes into sleep, i.e. automatically powers off, the USB connection is lost. The only way to get the USB connection back is to unplug and re-plug the USB cable. This is a huge pain to me. I am using Brother HL-6050D."
1,Buyer Beware,"Linksys technical support told me this would work with Windows 7 (32 bit). So, I bought it. After two hours of frustration with Cisco/Linksys technical support, the technician said she needed to consult with another technician and would phone me back in 15 minutes. She never did. This item does not work with Windows 7 (32 bit). Moreover, a company represntative told me that Cisco/Linksys was going out of the print server business. What to do? Buy a new printer with built-in print server. If I could, I would rate this product at less than one star."
4,Wireless Print Router,"The device it's self works fine, not problem in the world. What I do have issue with it the semi-false advertising, specifically the compatibility with Windows Vista. I purchased the device with the understanding that, based on the information provided, that it would be compatible with the latest Microsoft OS. It seems that not the case. Thank God there are people out there who find work arounds for this soft of 'short coming'."
2,Does not work with Windows 7,"This print server is not compatible with Windows 7. I don't recall that being mentioned in the requirements. Perhaps I missed it; I don't know.The non-compatibility is confirmed by Linksys tech support. They could not predict a date when a patch might be available to use with this print server. So, I have a brand new wireless print server with no packaging that I can't use. No original package means not returnable."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"Do NOT buy this print server. It will not work with Windows 7--and Linksys will not help. Maybe if you plan never, ever to upgrade from Windows XP it might be useful, but otherwise it is a piece of unsupported junk."
1,Don't buy this print server,"This print server is terrible - the setup program dosen't work on any windows box, you can't connect and do a straight LPD print to it's ip address, the support is awful, and using it is a pain. I'd sell the one I have, but I wouldn't want to force someone else to use this terrible product. So I'll swallow the cost and get a wireless print server that actually works."
5,Exactly what I wanted and expected,"I received this device yesterday, 10/19/2009 and installed it this morning, 10/20. I read the other reviews advising that the printer be set up on your PC first before beginning the setup of this device. Then I followed the directions which I downloaded from Linksys to the letter from a WinXP Home machine to do the initial setup. Once I successfully printed a test page to my HP Officejet 6210 and scanned an image from it to my Windows PC, I began to tackle 'my' PC running Ubuntu. I copied my instance of the OJ6210 and changed the Device URI to ipp://192.168.1.103/631 and viola! It all works - so far. I will update if I have any problems. Good luck!"
1,Be Careful,"I purchased this not realizing that it works with so few printers. I even went out and bought a new printer, and yes, you guessed it, it didn't work with that one either. It is very limited on which printers it works with so BE CAREFUL to research, and check thoroughly if it will work with your printer. I had been using a linksys wired print server for years, and I was very happy with it, but this one did not work. It also has major issues working with Windows Vista. I just wish that these companies would work together a little more closely when designing a product."
2,Doesn't support all printers,"After some setup challanges, this device worked pretty well with my old Brother printer, but when I bought a new HP color laser, it would not support it. Finally after many converstaions with Linksys support, they said it would not work with my printer and could not be upgraded to do so. They even suggested that I exchange my printer for one on thier support list! :-( Unacceptable."
2,will not work on vista 64bit!,"If your computer runs windows vista 64bit or the new windows 7, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!It will not work. Since this is a bi-directional server, you must install a virtual USB port on each oomputer.This software will not install on 64bit computers. You are then left with sending your print jobs to the servers IP address which is a) one way only so forget about that fancy printer/scanner you have and b) will not work anyway. This unit refuses to work as a traditional print server.The box and web site both say vista supported.I called customer service and spoke to a level 1 tech. He did not know what a print server was. Level 2 was no better. Level 3 began to tell me how I could set it up on a TCP/IP port. I explained I wanted the bi-directional function I PAID FOR, and he said he thought he had a solution and would call back in a hour. That was three days ago."
1,Misleading representation,Does NOT work well with Canon multifunction printer. Infuriating software insists that the Canon drivers need to be installed and will not proceed with the rest of its own installation even though the printer *IS* properly installed. Browsed web to find workaround that allowed sharing just the printer but not other functions but that connection was still not reliable. I returned this device and bought a Silex (specifically suited for the Canon) instead which installed easily and works flawlessly.
1,Didn't work for me.....,"I spent hours trying to get this to work, and I am pretty good with computers. Spent hours on the phone with linksys and finally got someone who said if my wireless router isnt Linksys it probably wont work. I bought this to use with my multifunction printer, will return."
1,Not worth the money.,"The setup wizard did not work with Vista, which required me to perform the setup manually. Most often, I need to power cycle the print server before using, otherwise sheets and sheets of garbage characters will be printed rather than the job I sent. I spoke to someone that has the same print server, that when used wired, the print server is much more reliable in its operation."
1,Does not work with Vista,"Wow, what a piece of $#!%.. It's been a long that I have seen not only a poor product, but the support is worse! It loaded on the XP system and I went on to load a laptop running Vista, guess what, error is OS is not supported. FAQ's, and linksys's VIRTUAL CHAT would pull up 15 answers that were useless... Four hours wasted on a product that does not work...I'm sending it back..."
1,It might work,"Linksys utility can not find my print driver and won't set it up. Spent a long time on the phone with technical support giving personal information (and repeating it several times) just to be transferred to someone who could help me; but not actually. Instead I was placed on hold for 15 minutes and then hung up on TWICE!!!!Horrible customer service. Poor software. Product never did work, even with tweaking the network and printer settings."
4,Wireless Print Server,Deliverd on time and as promised at a competitive price. Relatively easy to instal and setup as is typical of Linksys products. Unfortunately did not meet my requirements (too slow). Will make a great gift for someone who had smaller file demands.
1,Wireless printer server,There needs to be much more information on the box and in the description about compatibility with systems & hardware. I had to return this at my expense when just a little more information would have let me make a better choice.
2,What a disappointment. Not worth the money.,I have almost all of these songs in the original and I was really disappointed in the renditions by these musicians. Maybe it's just that Green was so good. Don't buy this if you have the original versions. Neither Man of the World or Green Manalishi is much like the original.
4,A great CD!,"This is a very good interpretation of Peter Green's music, with the benefit of modern recording. The musicians appear to have real feeling for the songs. My favourite song would have to be 'Fleetwood Mac' covered by Stu Hamm, Jonathon Mover and Larry Mitchell - there is some blistering guitar work in this song, it is quite heavy too.I am pleased they made this 2 CD's instead of just one, there would have been too many good songs missed. Any longer and there would be too many similar sounding songs, so a good compromise."
2,My Review on Strawberry Shortcake cartoon,"I just watched Strawberry Shortcake dvd World of Friends and what I throught of the cartoon was so-so !I grew up watching Strawberry Shortcake cartoon as a little girl in the 1980 ! I know this cartoon is very suitable for little girls at any age !The dvd contains : Strawberry Shortcake commerical and games , A specail of the friendship club on dvd !"
1,threw money away,"I could have done a better job had I cut a plastic bag in half. The first time I put it on for the birthday suprise it was supposed to be, it tore... need I say more?"
4,"Interesting, but not as controversial as one might think","After reading The Female Brain from dr. Brizendine, nothing can surprise me regarding the way that our brain works. Maybe that is the reason I did not find this book to be so mind-opening. However, it shows some very interesting aspects of human view on beauty. It seems we still think like our ancestors did when it comes to beauty, despite all the education and knowledge we have now. If you have never read something similar, I recommend you to read this book, as it could open the whole new world to you."
2,Interesting ideas but poorly written,"I didn't like this book. Not only was it poorly edited and organized, but while it did open my mind to the concept of beauty as a biological adaptation, I found that it jumped to conclusions from minimal evidence. Much of the material that Etcoff cited to prove the biology of beauty seemed to clearly indicate that beauty is significantly influenced by culture. Despite these studies, the idea of beauty being at least partially constructed by culture was for the most part denied or ignored. Furthermore, the book often contradicted itself, asserting vastly different ideas from paragraph to paragraph, with no explanation for these conflicting messages. Lastly, some of Efcoff's assertions were just down-right wrong. For example, presumably to illustrate the instinctual power of beauty, she writes that, ""we do not introspect about beauty or think about other things in it's presence."" Really??"
5,"interesting, scientific, well-documented","Besides being an entertaining read, this book answers questions I have pondered before, like what does it mean to be beautiful and why are people attracted to beauty.I think these questions have been ignored by many because they're not especially politically correct and they may be deemed frivolous and unscientific. But Dr. Etcoff gives these issues the scientific and historical analysis they deserve, and she backs up her statements with hard facts.Dr. Etcoff also touches on related issues like fashion and, my favorite part of the book, scents.It doesn't seem like Dr. Etcoff had any kind of agenda while writing this book. This may be the main thing that sets this book apart from other writings on beauty. It is refreshingly impartial and intelligent."
2,Meh....,"Firstly, Dr. Etcoff opens her book with a reference to Naomi Wolf; however, her interpretation of The Beauty Myth is deeply flawed, as is much of the book. While Etcoff claims to use ""cutting edge"" studies, a quick glance through the back of the book reveals that many of the studies cited are decades old. The book lacks cohesive organization; Etcoff cites multi-cultural studies but fails to integrate them into a cohesive argument. Etcoff fails to convince one of her thesis; rather than writing a serious, comprehensive inquiry into the biological basis for beauty, she opted to make a quick buck with this sensationalist, scattered book."
2,Nice theory but what about people of color,"Some of her ""scientifically proven"" ideas do not include the majority of people in the world. By her estimations, white people would be evolutionary (on a beauty scale) surpassing every other race. I like the fact that scientist are studing these ideas but they need to be inclusive in their research. Also a lot of the cultural norms for beauty are cultural norms, not just biological. Why don't men were certain devices to show off their fertility? Other cultures do(exaggerated cod pieces). Interesting book but more research needs to be done before I am just on ship."
4,Is beauty an honest advertiser?,"Etcoff does a great job showing how our response to beauty is innate and deeply connected with our urge to reproduce. But I would have wished for a bit more exploration of the way beauty also might fool us. For example, she talks about men preferring women with hourglass shapes and more feminine features, because it signals health and fertility. But then she doesn't give information about whether this is true. Are more feminine looking women more fertile in reality? Are they healthier? We don't know."
2,"Goodie old stuff, nothing inspiring","I picked up this book because my gf is reading it (we are not in the same city) and out of my curiosity i picked this up to know what kind of books she's reading. As a person who has a deep interest in evolutionary psychology I was deeply disappointed by the depth of this book. At first i thought this book will be something more on evolutionary history and what not but it turns out to be a collection of randomly put together research findings in regarding the realm of beauty. Come on, at least have something new to present please."
3,It's both culture and biology.,Our perception of things is both cultural and biological. There are no simple explainations and we should beware of such from either camp.
1,"If I could give it 0, I would.",Let me sum it up for you. Women are objects. Women should be insecure. Women should buy all the garbage the author's magazine(Cosmo) advertises. The beauty industry should profit from women's insecurities. Whatever.
1,Another example of 'social darwinism'....,"...which is as simplistic as it is morally suspect. The desire to explain all human interaction in terms of biological survival is tiresome, to say the least."
3,"Good effort, but focused too much on visual beauty","A good effort, but the beguiling simplicity of the sociobiologist position obscures the uncomfortable truth that standards of beauty vary cross-culturally, and exhibit wild swings in fashion. Only a more complex linking of the social constructionist and the essentialist influences in society adequatly the spectrum of human relationship behaviour.Also, this book ignores mounting evidence of the non-visual cues used by various modalities within human consciousness to detect and respond to other humans.C+"
4,Interesting review and scientific findings on Beauty,Found the reading extremely interesting. No one has ever presented in such detail with scientific research about human fascination with Beauty. Its one of those human characteristics that is so often ignored by scientific researchers and yet is playing on our minds 24x7.
2,"simplistic, boring and shallow","I like the way she quotes desomnd's aquatic ape theory, in the same paragraph as ""developing excrine sweat glands for savannah cooling"" hah! She is just glossing over the trendiest aspects of cultural anthroplogy, in this book. These best sellers must be targeted at the 85% pseudo-intellectual dempgraphic. Eileen morgan's stuff is a far better read whether or not you take it seriously."
3,Not quite,"I've been reading this book over the last week and while it makes sense to me based on what she's reporting on, it doesn't make sense to me based on what I see in the real world. Etcoff claims that babies stare longer at attractive faces and that babies, kids, teenagers, and adults of both sexes agree on what is attractive. ??? Has she never watched Howard Stern, when he has a couple of young women strip down to their skivvies and he and his cronies evaluate them? They never agree! I never agree with a certain friend of mine what makes a woman pretty (he likes thin blondes), but my brother and I always do (we like full bodied women with big eyes). I know Etcoff makes a distinction between fashion and beauty, but I think that distinction may be minimal."
1,Pseudo-scientific claptrap!,Etcoff does not understand the constructionist position and paints a bad caricature of it. The point is not that women follow the whims of Revlon but that the very desires we experience are socially constructed. Anyone can knock down a strawman or strawwoman.

5,must buy Mantovani CD!,"This is it..the best instrumenatal Mantovani CD.Mantovani excels the best rendition of the best songs from the 60's to the 90's.I love their version of ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"",""007 Suite"",""Nessum Dorma"",and ""Medley of Jerusalem/Chariots of Fire"".It's really INCOMPARABLE!Don't delay order today...."
1,Think about buying this book...DON'T!!!,"This book is a taped cheap paperback that costs $50, but that's not all that is wrong with it, it also has NO index and NO explanations. Plus it is littered with advertisements galore. The cheap book which costs $50 is made by ""The Technology Group"", which by my experience is a Group that likes to make money of Occult Students. A book for the index is sold seperately at $25, and a book for the explanations is also sold seperatley at $45, plus a book of index cards which contain the modern day symbols is also sold seperately at $18. You are better off not getting anything from this Technology Group located in El Sobrante, CA. Trust me on this one book, it is nothing more than a book that is made to take advantage of Occult students by taking their money and giving them a cheap ripoff, so cheap all the pages look like the been done at Kinko's. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!!"
5,Essential for all prospective pipekeepers,"Evelyn writes as a long-time sister/friend, who opens her life and heart to you in a way that makes you feel she is sitting beside you in the desert. Her words cause you to feel every step of her journey as your own. Don't even consider asking your elder for the honor of becoming a pipekeeper without understanding the sacredness of this responsiblity. I understand that Evelyn is no longer walking this mortal path, but I am sure wherever she is the adventure is one of Honor. A respectful, and authentic picture of the Native American through the eyes of a woman who will become one of your heros."
5,a lovely gift.,"I read this book years ago and it had a profound effect on my life. I stopped. I've taken a different path since. To this day, I still lay on the ground for Mother Earth to speak to me or for healing."
4,"Delicious - Not just ""delicious, y'know... considering it's gluten-free""","I've tried a few products from Ener-G. While some of their products rank among other gluten-free substitutes on the market (you'll eat it, but it's clearly not as tasty as its wheat-based counterpart), their Brown English Muffins with Sweet Potato are actually delicious. I use them as English muffins, as burger buns, as sandwich bread, as garlic bread, as mini-pizza crusts--whatever. My girlfriend, who is not restricted by gluten intolerance, loves them as much as I do--which is testament that I haven't just lowered my standards due to how long it's been since I've eaten wheat-based English muffins.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I often find one or two muffins with mold on them. Mind you, this is only one or two in a package of 24, but I think Ener-G needs to address this problem."
2,not-moldy muffins were good,"My daughter loves these but 2 out of 6 packages were VERY moldy when they arrived (way before expiration date). I've read in my celiac yahoo group that this is not uncommon for ener-g products. Unfortunately, they have not been very responsive to complaints about this problem."
1,Were moldy when they arrived,I was really disappointed when the Ener-G Sweet Potato English muffins arrived and three of the packages were moldy.
2,Another case of moldy product,"This was my first time buying sweet potato muffins from Ener G Foods. I have enjoyed other breads by them but I was disappointed when I opened the box. I saw that one package already had mold spots on it. Within a week, two more packages had started to mold. The expiration date is in 2010. I put the remainder of the packages in the freezer though it is not suppose to be necessary. For the money I don't expect to be buying unedible product."
3,Passable muffins,Not a great gluten free option. It is better than nothing but the taste isn't my favorite.
4,"Gritty, sexy, action flick",This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I have always found WingsHauser films to be very much a guilty pleasure. This is no exception. Hauser notonly stars but also directs this gritty action flick. Hauser plays a cop trackingdown a serial killer who films his murders as scenes from great movies. Hauser isalways good as a tough guy cop. This film also features Kathleen Kinmont. She issuch a beautiful woman. This film is well worth the VOD rental price.
3,Many missing elements,"He has good some points, and his system is well thought out, but as a drummer of 10 years I found the following missing:- an introduction to who he his or what his music sounds like when played with band- any lesson or part thereof above 90 bpm- any treatment of swing, or a good treatment of dynamicsHe's not really much worse than much of the drum-instruction establishment which acts as if notes on paper add up to good set playing.Better drum instructional videos for what I think drummers should sound/teach like: Carter Beauford, Under the Table and Drumming, Akira Jimbo Metamorphoses, Zoro Commandments of R&B.; I have a feeling Weckl would be pretty good too, but I got taken in by the reviews on this one.."
3,Throwing it out (after 2 years),"(Update... I have simply given up on this chair, it looks perfect but caused hip and back problems)POSITIVES:-The chair looks very nice-Very very reasonable priceNEGATIVES:-The seat does not have enough cushioning (I am currently sitting on a $400 chair which I can comfortably sit on for the whole day)-The seat-back is not comfortaable (it causes one to hunch over)... one should be less than 5 feet 5 inches to not hunch overOVERALL:Looks very good, very inexpensive but not comfortable"
1,Simplistic,This is a completely useless book which does nothing more than walk one through DB2's installation process and Administrative GUIs. Buy the Version 6.1 Certification Guide instead and use it with the free product documentation. You'll learn about Database Administration beyond running setup.exe and trivial use of the administrative GUI.
3,Install failure renders book useless,"On the first install I had a network card improperly installed in the machine. A registration number came back from IBM. I uninstalled and retried the install. It worked fine until it started creating the sample files. It generated the following error: SQL8008N The product ""DB2 Personal Edition"" does not have a valid license key installed and the evaluation period has expired. Functions specific to this product are not enabled. The expiration may be due to Y2k. The second install was in 2000.I like the concept, but do not have a lot of time to debug the install. It should work on Windows/95, but it didn't for me. Therefore, I can't utilize the book."
5,A great down-to-earth practitioner's guide,"This book is great reading for anyone who is trying to make sense of their role as a leader. It first sets out 4 clear leadership styles, and then marries the styles simply to 4 different types of business situations. What I loved about this book was the simplicity, which helped me do two things: first thoughtfully apply the concepts to analyze my past experiences, and second, to use it effectively in my interactions with my teams."
1,"This ""Window"" is Broken","A bad clone of a great model. In some cases, imitation is not just a form of flattery -- it's a diservice. If you want to learn Situational Leadership go to the source: The Management of Organizational Behavior or The Situational Leader by Paul Hersey. Better yet, avail yourself of one of his world famous workshops. He has a new book as well: Leadership - A Behavioral Science Approach. The Leadership Window omits the most critical elements of this behavioral model. This ""window"" is broken and distorted. Save your money and go for the real deal."
2,Bogart in the Big House,"A disappointing 1937 prison drama that remains notable for Humphrey Bogart's sympathetic portrayal of a redemptive criminal. Otherwise, ""San Quentin"" is strictly routine. Pat O'Brien makes the most of his contrived role as the reform-minded captain romancing Bogart's sister (a miscast Ann Sheridan). The clichéd proceedings are briefly enlivened by a road-gang escape and ensuing chase. Unfortunately, the Hays Office took the sting out of this Warner Bros. programmer."
5,Great Depression-era Prison Film!!!,This is a great depression prison era film starring Pat O'Brien and the featuring the then emerging movie legend Humphrey Bogart.It's a must see!!!
2,Nothing But a .45,"While holding promise, Combat Handguns ultimately falls short, serving a very narrow audience. The magazine focuses almost exclusively on the 45-caliber weapon and every possible incarnation it could conceivably have. If you are interested obtaining information about any other caliber and how it pertains to your self-defense needs, you will find almost no information whatsoever. Its content seems to consist largely of slick color advertisements from a wide variety of manufacturers. It does have some informative legal and self-defense articles, but these are often packaged in the most inflammatory manner possible with titles like, `It's A Three on One Showdown, AND THEY'VE GOT YOUR WIFE!!!' If your looking for a gun magazine that focuses on the handgun try Guns and Ammo's Handgun magazine, it is far more balanced. Unless you're into 45's and kidnapped wives, then this is your magazine."
3,Combat Handguns,"From continued purchases at the newsstand I know this magazine covers my primary interests, however, one should live long enough to actually receive their first issue through the Amazon subscription service. Twelve to sixteen weeks to get your first issue is absolute incompetence on someone's part. You add a name to the subscription mailing service and mail the damn thing - what could possibly delay it four months except incompetence? I note, however, that my credit card was charged immediately for something I may, repeat may, receive in about four months. I'm very unhappy with this service, or should I say disservice!"
3,Read once,"Personally, Im not one for Teletubbies, but my daughter liked the cover... If your child is a fan, I definately recommend this book, but if not, Don't bother. It wasn't a very interesting read for my daughter and she has ost interest in the book. I would recommend the Dr. Seuss line of books, which seem far more interesting and entertaining..."
1,Do Not Buy This Crap,This is nothing but soft porn for striaght guys. You wouldn't believe how badly this is put together. Looks like a bad home movie!I didn't make it past the first 2 minutes. What a waste of time and money!!!!! YUK! YUK! YUK! I'm surprised Borders and/or Amazon would even offer this to the general public!!!
2,Not worth it for a new eater!,"We bought this chair right when our baby started to eat solids. We liked that it was well-constructed and very attractive. Like others, we were a little disappointed in the straps - difficult to use, and strangely located right at the back of the seat.We used it for several months, and it worked okay. But as the little one has been just learning to eat and can be very messy, we were getting more and more tired of constantly cleaning it and our dining table. We read somewhere a recommendation for a $25 high chair at Ikea. We bought that chair, and it's been a night and day difference! The Ikea chair is easy to clean, comfortable, and easy to strap.We know that we'll eventually go back to the tripp trapp, and that it will have utility for a much longer period of time, but I just can't recommend it for those with babies. Go with a regular high chair and consider the tripp trap when they're really ready to eat at the table."
3,Great but not too comfy for baby,"I like the color and the style and the durability of the tripp trapp, but i have to say it's not very comfortable for my baby. the straps are rough on his neck and he gets tired of the flat hard char very quickly -givin that it takes him a long time to finsh his food (8mo old). I would buy the additional padding but it's a bit expensive... still thinking about it."
4,Good reference!,"This book provides a lot of useful information on landscaping and gardening. The only disappointment for the book is that the illustrations are in black and white, which makes it difficult to really get a feel of the designs and color schemes."
4,Carl Carlton - German Rocker,"The Amazon notes for this album are incorrect. This is not the soul singer from Detroit, but an English-singing rocker from East Frisia, Germany. This is a good album throughout, with one great song, ""Days of Magic."" Lots of Stones-like dual guitar work."
1,NOT roll pin punches,"The picture is of course incorrect, there are only 5 punches in this kit. It would not be a bad deal if they were truly roll pin punches. However, they do not have the necessary dimple or protrusion on the tip to center the pins and keep from deforming the ends. The smaller of the two are pretty much flat on the ends, the three larger punches have circular ring like indentations on the tip. Close but no cigar. Made in China of course. You get what you pay for."
5,The first Horror Core soundtrack.,"The Fear was agreat movie, the soundtrack even better. Most people have never heard of the artists on the release, but they are by far some of the greatest in the industry. It is rare for a collection of obscure musicians to get together on the same release. This album will never get old or boring."
2,Not what I had expected.,This soundtrack was not at all what I had expected it to be. I was hoping that the song Wild Horses would be on it. It was the song playing on that magical rollercoaster ride. I was hoping the Bush song would be on there too. I guess we all can't have the soundtracks they way we want them. But the movie was AWESOME! One of my favorites!
5,Passed down from generation to generation,"my great grandfather was given this book by his parents in the early 20's (orriginally published in '22). He gave it to my mother, who in turn gave it to me. It is tattered, and some of the pages are falling out but besides that its in good condition. I absolutely loved this book, it is so creative, i am actually going to go out and buy one for my mom just for the ... of it, and then one for my 9 year old cousin."
1,Waste of money.....,"I bought this book thinking that it would be good ""toilet lit"", something for the guests to read. I really didnt like it, but since I spent the money I still put it in the guest bath. Turns out most of our guests thought it was dry and quite boring. We tend to enjoy the ""letter sytle"" books....but this one was pretty much the worst. I would tend to recommend either Consumer Joe (our current favorite) or Lazlo Letters. I hope this helps."
5,Quick and Funny!,From the title to the last letter this book was a fun and fast read. A real original humor book that gets funnier every time you read it. The fact that this was never meant to be a book in the first place makes the whole concept more hillarious. Great job to the author for its brilliant execution.
3,misleading premise,"I thought this book would be a collection of resumes/cover letters/etc. actually submitted to various companies -- instead it's all written by the author. yes, some of them are funny, but his schtick gets tired after a while. Save your money -- read a few while standing in the store."
2,More imagination please . . .,"A friend gave me this book for my birthday, knowing how much I love prank letters. It seemed promising, but honestly, I found the letters to be very bland and unimaginative. The ideas weren't fleshed out with enough detail and most of the jokes fell flat. Nowhere near the caliber of Letters From A Nut or Lazlo Letters."
5,humor and more,"One of my marketing students brought this book to my attention. The author succeeds in finding the humor in the difficulties of job hunting during a sluggish economy. But what I was most impressed with is his genuine knowledge of marketing and his willingness to riducule all that he knows. It has now become routine for me to begin each class by reading one of the letters from this book, many of which have set the mood for fantastic discussions and case studies. This should be required reading for all business school grads lacking a creative edge."
5,Oh my gosh! This guy is insane!,Joe has just played the greatest practical joke ever on the stuffy hiring practices of corporate America. This is no doubt the funniest book I have ever read. I almost wish I was unemployed.
5,'Sticken it to the man' humor at its best.,"If you are unemployed or stuck in a go no-where job because 'the man is holding you down', this book will make you happy. This guy does something about it in a funny, unthreatening way. It appears he even self publishes these letters, as if to give one more little jab to the 'man'. His letter to his very own father is priceless."
1,Save your money....,"Not too thrilled with the book, would have rather bought another copy of Lazlo and given it away. Save your money and look else where."
4,excellent stories,"These are Dick's earliest short stories. They are interesting and well-written, and there are some real gems here, especially the one about the dog barking at the trash truck. The only thing which would have improved the book as a whole would have been an introduction and some more contextual information at the end of the book."
3,For hardcore fans only,"Excellent but short performances by B.B. King and Joan Baez. Most of the film is a documentary (with concert performances mixed in). Film and editing quality is mixed (mostly poor). Most of documentary is shot by inmates. Sound quality is poor. Advertised as Dolby Digital 2.0, but it sure sounds like mono to me."
3,"""The classis that made Candy famous""","The world has gone around to many times to keep this one on the shelf.The movie is so funny and a feminist classic about the low life getting together to make it rich life.The movie makes me sick it is so funny.Jane Forth... makes a part as a foot rubber.Jackie,Candy and Holly start a womens liberation group against men...."
1,"Worser than ""Trash""! A waste of time!","As a big fan of Paul Morrissey's great movies ""Flesh for Frankenstein"" and ""Blood for Dracula"", I couldn't believe how worse ""Trash"" is compared to them. ""Women in revolt"" is even more terrible than ""Trash"". The bad plot and the poor acting are giving me stomach cramps. this movie is a complete waste of precious time! So avoid it immediately!"
1,Waste of time and money,Followed the directions carefully for quite a long time. They are a bit large to have to take 3 at once. But the real issue is that they did nothing for me. No notable change in any aspect of my body. I expected to at least feel a little perkier and maybe have my nails grow better. But…nothing. Why bother?
4,Great Audio,"Great audio. The only drawback to not having the physical book is not being able to copy the ""major definite purpose"" form so that you can fill it in yourself and edit/update later on. I will also be purchasing this book in printed format."
1,Don't waste your $,Earl nightingale does not read think & grow rich...he talksabout the principles in it. Total ripoff don't be fooled like I was
2,Title somewhat misleading,"Perhaps it is shame on me, for I thought I was getting a narration by Earl Nightingale of the ENTIRE book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill."
2,too short,"I thought this was a ""book"" and it felt more like a essay. It is one CD, and while there are good tips -- I have heard most of them before."
4,Avatar Book 3 Volume 4,"Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 3 Fire, Vol. 4At last the time has come for Aang to face the Fire Lord. The world comes full circle and the power of the Avatar is finally realized. Will Aang be powerful enough to defeat the Fire Lord and will he finish him off or stand by his principles that there must be another way to rid the world of Ozai?Don't miss the final two episodes of this saga."
3,This book was OK,"This book was alright but it has NOTHING on R.L Stine's "" The Cheater"" it seems that's was Diane Hoh was trying to copy off of. Diane could have come up ith something better, this book looked like it as written from the mind of a first grader.The pranks that ""The Whisperer"" made Shea do were more funny than scary.The only thing I liked was the ending because it has a surprise shock to it."
5,Suspenseful but Entertaining,"I read Nightmare Hall: The Whisper by Diane Hoh and it was such a great book. I could not put the book down every time I would try to put it down for the night something suspenseful happened and I kept on reading. In this story a girl named Shea is getting menacing phone calls right after an accident with her college teacher happens and the teacher gets put in the hospital. This book wasn't that hard to read but if you weren't concentrating not only are you missing out but you are sure to miss something important. I highly recommend this book to any one who likes suspense,mystery,and a little spook in their lives."
3,Not Happy,Some of the holes weren't drilled in far enough and there was a HUGE crack in the wood frame and the color isn't very even.
3,"Third Graders at The Potomac School in McLean, VA","Most of our eight- and nine-year-olds found this sequel to The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman a disappointment. Although they enjoyed the tale being told (again) through letters, postcards and newspaper articles, they thought this storyline was confusing with too many new characters to follow. They did love the oil-over-acrylic illustrations, and advise the second and third grade audience to pay close attention to the details to better understand the fast-paced plot. For the best travel-tracking, they recommend the reader become familiar with the cities and states mentioned, and refer often to the maps on the book's end pages. As an introduction to the recurring places and people, our young reviewers suggest starting with The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman. In fact, the reappearance of one particular character renewed their interest in this story and had our third graders hoping he'll be featured in another, more clever Woodman travelogue."
2,none,"Actually i happen to have uploaded a song on my pc,with the keywords NAME CALLING,so am looking for the artist of the song.All i know is that the artist is black like me,and i failed to get the information as regards his name,from the cd i copied from.please if u can help me,i will be very greatfull...PS ROBER."
3,How to pray in public,More complicated than I thought. Was looking for more simple ways to pray less formal. Other than that the book was okay
2,Whole Church AMEN,The book has a narrow focus for me and filled a particular need. Iteresting read and useful for teaching a class on prayer forms.
5,Excellent,"Great performance from Haden with Keith Jarrett,Ornette Coleman,Alice Coltrane,and Paul Motian."
5,A truly goddess voice,"Listening to Dulce Pontes in every moment at any time brings the sweet memories of the long afternoons in Portugal seatting by the sea leaning into the mistical breaze of the Atlantic ocean down in Algarve, and savoring the beautifull songs of FADO from the QUEEN ""AMALIA RODRIGUES"", just steps away ,the fisherman worked on their nets for another hard day to come, but the melodies bring us the hope of joy and brigther days as long as the FADO goes on...and the Fado never dies.I was only six and thanks to her melodies ,i can become a child again at the touch of my finger tips in my ""CD Player"".Dulce is without a question the most greatest voices of fado coming from the gorgeous book song that is Portugal.In ""Lagrimas"" she brough us ""Tears""of joy now in ""Caminhos"" shes bringing us a ""Stairway to Heaven""....Wondefull CD ...Shes truly a Goddess voice....Luis Caldeira, St.Thomas04/09/1999"
2,Not Good at All...,"I first started readed L'Engle's books because I saw they were making a movie on the Disney Channel based on ""A Ring of Endless Light."" I read that book and I fell in love with Vicky and the Austin family. When I learned that there were other books about them I immediately checked them out from the library. The first one I read was this one. I was VERY disappointed. It lacked a central message or point and seemed quite disorganized. I put it down one day, almost done with the thing and never picked it back up except to return it to the library.""A Ring of Endless Light"" was so smooth and perfect. I guess it was because L'Engle had become a much better writer by the time she wrote that one..."
5,wonderful family book,"This is a lovely, perceptive story of family life in a small New England town--written by the author of _A Wrinkle in Time_, it sparkles with the same fine attention to personality and to the reactions of a loving family in a crisis"
4,A good book!!!,"I liked this book, but at some points, I was like, come on, be real. It was realistic, but families today, aren't so perfect.My parents don't play a guitar, or have dogs and cats, but that doesn't make them abnormal.I think Madeleine L'engles idea of a family is too small minded. Not everyone is the same, and thats fine. This book made me feel as thogh I wasn't coool, simply because my family was missing a bit of homilyness. I think that lots of readers will feel the same about.Otherwise, a great book.P.S-If you liked this one, you should read the others in the series."
3,An enjoyable book,"The story Meet The Austin's was a story about a normal family accepting a new child, Maggie, into their home after her father died. The family experiences their ups and downs while Maggie is living with them. I recommend this book because it shows how a normal family accepts a stranger into their lives and has to live with her for quite a long time. This book shows how people overcome their differences and begin to accept each other for their similarities. I think people should read this book because it can teach us all a lesson on accepting and trusting other people, even though parts of this book seem too perfect, like singing and playing instruments as a family, it still is a well written book about a likeable family."
5,This was my ideal family,"I read this book when it first was published and then and there resolved that that is what my family would be like. Only in the past year did I discover the sequels. Each book in the series stands on its own, the settings are not predictable and the characters each have their own personality and each grows and shifts inside the skin of their personality. What I mean by this is that though there is change and growth they each develop within the structure of their own selfs (sic). .I never cared for A Wrinkle In Time, so if you didn't either, don't let that keep you from getting to know this wonderful family. Joelie Hicks.."
1,Wrong book,I have received two different orders of this book from two different sellers & it is NOT by Mary Elizabeth Braddon - it's the one by russel braddon. Apparently there's a problem with the ISBN - just FYI.
2,Remember When...,"Remember when The Used straight up rawked? Yeah, me too. Their first CD was so raw and had such a great balance of Bert's singing/screaming. I was always amazed how in the same line he could go from melodic singing to screaming and then back to the melodic singing in the same breath, while at the same time staying catchy. He doesn't seem to do that anymore. This CD feels like he is trying to rip-off MCR's sound, but failing. Maybe they will come back and rawk, but for now, I will stick to 30 Seconds To Mars and MCR for my fill of catchy, hard rock."
5,Lies for the liars is fantastic,"If you liked ""Life and Death"" you will love this album. It is a little harder sound but it is great. I have listened to it over and over."
5,Don't call them emo...at least not anymore (Short and sweet review),"With the release of their self titled debut and ""In Love and Death"" and even their new live record ""Berth"", The Used have set their sights on the punk/emo scene with their new album ""Lies for the Liars"", which IMO is their best album to date. This is probably their most hardcore album to date.Although a bit short (39 minutes?), LFL is an essential to all Used fans.It has great music. My favorite songs are The Bird And The Worm, The Ripper, and Liar Liar. THis album proves that they're hardcore, not emo. They used to be Emo in ILAD, but not anymore. This album rocks!"
1,The Users,I haft to admit there last album was o.k but they have just gone to far I mean writing a song about one of there X friends Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance with pretty handsome awkward I think it is very immature and as for there music awful and the lyrics don't make any sense and when the lyrics do make sense there pointless I cant sit down and listenif none of that made sense DON'T BY THE ALBUM!!! AND DONT SUPPORT THOSE USERS
3,not their best effort.,"There are a few good songs and a bunch of mediocre ones--a surprise from a band I considered to be a favorite of mine. I loved their first album, loved half of the second and only about 1/4 of this one. Unfortunate. I expected better for all the hype."
5,Simply Fantastic,"This is quite possible the best album by The Used so far. It combines much of the energy and emotion of their debut album ""The Used"" with the more polished sound from their second Album ""In Love and Death"". They've toned down the screaming a little bit (likely related to Bert's throat node development), and thrown in some more prominent guitar riffs. In the end, what you get is a very fluid progression and full sound, with that classic emotion they're known for."
2,Not impressed.,"I was very excited when I heard that The Used had a new cd so of course like a good fan I bought it as soon as it came out. I don't know why I did though I should have just downloaded the 2 good songs off of the internet. Seriously, I was very disappointed. While its not a bad cd there's just nothing there. I do really like Smother me and Find A Way because I've been waiting for The Used to put out a few more slower songs, but those are the only good ones. And there's a lot of repetition. The song writing isn't very creative on this cd and the lyrics tend to repeat an awful lot. Don't even get me started on Liar Liar. That is the worst song ever and it sucks to even say that because I love the Used so much, but its a really sucky song."
5,awesome,this cd is pretty much amazing!i bought it the day it came out and i love every song on this cd. you should def. buy it if you love The Used. you wont be disappointed
4,Great,"Like most people I am not to happy about how ""soft"" this album is. I am a HUGE fan of the Used, they are my favortie, so I have been waiting for this album for a very long time. The first tim I heard it I kept waiting and waiting for all the hard songs and they never came. The CD is far from bad though. Almost every song is great. The first CD,,, Golden, Their second CD not as good but still amazing. This CD is not as good as the previous 2 but is still great. Maybe i am just saying this cause i am bias, in my mind the used can do no wrong.... PS. Listen to their bonus tracks!!"
2,Not That Great Of A CD!!!,I Thought This CD Wasn't As Good As The Past CD's.There's Only 5 Good Songs On This CD I Think.I Wouldn't Waste Your $ On This Album.*The Ripper*The Bird and the Worm*Hospital*Liar Liar*Devil Beside You
2,not good,This album is just horrible. Im sorry. Like someone else said on here. The songs sound so random. The album is all over the place and not many of the songs stand out.I seriously give up on the Used.The first album was so good and afterwards they just went downhill.Im very disappointed.
1,Trash for the useless,"Maybe my jeans arent tight enough. Maybe its the fact that I like women. Whatever it is, this cd just isnt for me. If you wear tight pants and are under the age of 14, and are under 100 pounds, you'll LOVE this record."
2,Too many pictures not enough contents,"I returned this book because it has almost no description of the airplanes. However, there are: 3 An-2; 2 An-12; 1 An-14; 1 An-22; 22 An-24; 26 IL-14; 23 IL-18; 11 IL-86; 6 KA-26; 2 LI-2(DC-3); 3 MI-2; 3 MI-3; 3 MI-6; 3 MI-8; 1 MI-10; 1 MI-12; 7 TU-104; 4 TU-114; 7 TU-124; 8 TU-134 and 2 TU-144 pictures.If you are looking for a picture album of Russian airplanes it might be for you, but you will NOT find any information about airplanes in this book. SO look somewhere else."
4,another winner,"Amanda does it again. Lie By Moonlight brings together Concordia Glade and one Ambrose Wells. She is a teacher by profession and damn proud of it. Wells is Quick's standard mystery do-gooder. But let's face it, we read these books because the heroines are smart and feisty and won't take ""no"" for an answer. And the fireworks between the two central characters is...well...explosive. The plot was a bit muddled but then again, considering the aforementioned, who cares?!"
3,Book was OK,"I too like this author, but in my opinion, this novel was not one of best. I thought the character development fell short, and we had more dialogue than actual excitement. I found myself interested in the story, liked the characters, but not wanting to go through all that reading for such a simple plot. Again, OK."
3,It's ok,"This is a historical romance about a teacher determined to protect her charges (four young ladies) against all comers. However, rather than being a gold digger, the hero here is the Victorian equivalent of a private investigator who just happens to practice mystical Eastern arts (and possesses a chest remarkably like a marble bust according to the cover). So the book is about two eccentric individuals colliding in the midst of madness, mayhem, and murder... which is standard cookie-cutter formula for Amanda Quick, who is on my chocolate-chip-cookie-comfort-books list. So I knew exactly what I was getting into and got exactly what I wanted, but I feel like I could have read any of her recent books because they've gotten so formulaic."
3,Lie by Moonlight is a good book.,"It's not a terrific book, it's not a memorable book, and it's not an enthralling book. To understand the underlying Vanza you have to have read the other Vanza books. The plot is terrific and it could have been a great book but it does really fall short.I don't regret reading it and will probably read it again (it'll be like I never read it!) but I'd say to get this from the library instead of buying it."
4,Changes I would make.,I feel that the lamp in this unit should be derated to 300 watts. The base is unstable to use on carpeted floors and the unit gets too hot and will melt synthetic fibers if it becomes upset. No switch on unit to shut it off. Cliff Coon
3,Works but don't get BURNED,"I purchased this unit form a local retailer for about the same price. Product works as designed and it puts out more that enough light to complete the job. I will, however, have to agree with the previous review in that this thing get ridiculously hot and will is a fire risk for anything that the light enclosure comes in contact with. I personally have burnt many a carpet fiber.There is a second model that has 2 of these units mounted on a metal stand, I think that's a much better purchase because you reduce your fire risk, that is unless the whole things falls over.Cheers"
4,positive review,I found this product to work great. Small and convenient to use. Shipping and handling was extremely quick and effecient.
3,Collar review,"Wasn't at all impressed with this product. Looks different than you'd expect from the photo and the price. Looks like the photo except the photo gives the impression of higher quality. It's a cheap, weak, leather. The photo must be of a very large collar because on the 20"" the stitching wasn't as small. It's not terrible, just very generic quality. Ok for an easy going pet but don't put it on a dog with drive. More decorative than functional."
1,Mushy English Muffins,"The Ener-G Foods English muffins look good in the packaging, but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom. This presents a gooy feel in the mouth, and both my husband and I got stomach aches. Won't be buying this again."
2,Not like regular English Muffins,"These english muffins are okay at best. They are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast. They definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise, do not taste the best."
2,Can't keep them from fallin' apart!,"I tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll, I couldn't cut them without falling apart! I ended up toasting them in pieces, more like chunks, and with enough cream cheese, they were only OK! Tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products I would recommend!"
2,Why is this our only choice for bread?,"Come on Amazon, give me a break. Powdered tofu? Get in some real food and I'll buy more from you. I went looking for table sugar. You've got 100 weird kinds of sugar (that you expect me to buy in bulk!) but NO just plain sugar. I'm not eatin' any more of this rice and tofu bread either.Sorry I just had to rant."
4,We like 'em!,"I'm not sure why no one seems to like these very much! They are pretty good to us. I haven't had a problem with them falling apart and they're easy to slice for toasting. My son,(who is the one on the GFCF diet), is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new, ate these muffins without hesitating. I sometimes poke a hole in the middle and serve as a 'bagel'. These are a regular staple in our house."
5,Good but slightly expensive,"This product is very good but I have this feeling that it is rather highly priced. I don't know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredients.People with Gluten problem are not just ""eating Healthy"" but are sick and should not be exploited. I like the muffins particularly when they are toasted."
3,soy free? not so sure,"Pkg says soy free. Ingredients (and my stomach/bladder) say otherwise!Also, lots of fiber in this one. If you can handle fiber (and soy) this food will fill you up like crazy. If you have IBS and have trouble with fiber,or are eating a low residue diet be careful....I'm going back to the bread. Eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the dreaded wheat..."
4,gluten free english muffins,"Tried this item liked it. This item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store, easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting. Around here driving 30 miles one way is local. P.S. These can make great mini pizzas"
3,No Free Flash Splash,"The cymbals are great! Excellent sound, but they don't come with the Free Flash Splash as advertised. Don't be fooled - and heaven forbid you try to explain this to someone at Amazon because they give you the run-around."
2,"If you're going to study, but another book. This one rots.","This is NOT the best self-study guide and claiming that it ""teaches all the essential skills needed to advance your career"" is a bunch of bunk.I'd rather spend a little extra money on a truly complete guide or for each application and learn it right the first time, instead of wasting my time with this book.Since the chapter on Access was so pathetic (coverage on Word and Excel was alright, but I'm sure someone has done better), I'm debating whether or not I even want to finish reading it.It may cover the exams, but don't rely on it if you've never used any Office products before. Print out the objectives from the MOUS website, buy yourself some decent study guides (even if it does cost more), then take the exam.If I could return it, I would."
3,Bad Cross Reference,Items listed under the exams section isn't always on the listed page number.Why not put this together the way you take the tests instead of being all over the place. Doesn't make since.I don't see a MS Office Certification logo on the book.
2,A poor resource,"First off, this book is not put together well - in more ways than one. After just studying the Excel portion, the pages started to come out - no joke. Secondly, this book is more scattered and smothered than Waffle House hash browns - if you catch my drift. There is neither ryhme nor reason as to its construction.Also, is this Microsoft certified? - I don't see the Microsoft logo on the book. I mean, let's call a spade a spade, shall we? This book is weak at best."
2,awkward expressions (cassette tapes),The topics of the chapters are not really fit for non-native speakers of Korean. There are many awkward expressions and unrealistic situations for non-native speakers to learn.
3,A Helpful Book with Some Problems,"Benjamin, et al have written a helpful book for those interested in learning how to conduct a child custody evaluation. The reservation I would offer is that they have made some unconventional recommendations that are not identified as such. For example, the authors advise against interviewing children younger than teenage. This is inconsistent with the practice of most experienced, custody evaluators. Another controversial and possibly dangerous suggestion is the destruction of video taping that is made during the evaluation process prior to court proceedings. I believe these and other, unconventional procedural recommendations that the authors make should be clearly identified as such, especially in a book that is subtitled ""Reducing Risks of Ethical Infractions and Malpractice"". With this reservation, the book is a useful addition to the references guiding those who perform child custody evaluations."
3,From a UM Perspective,"I currently attend Upper Merion Area High School. While the movie was certainly entertaining (well, the first half anyway), the portrayal of some of the teachers who still work at UM seemed over-dramatized, and not very true-to-life. Still, it was interesting to see actors portraying people I know, as they were twenty some years ago."
5,quality dog food,I do not feed my dog grocery store brands of food because of the use of corn and other by products. This is a quality product that helps keep my dog healthy and out of the vet's office.
4,Continuing the tradition,"This book continues in the time honored tradition of Jewish tails. I don't doubt that there is more truth than parable here, yet it feels so much like a continuation of the stories that I read as a youth.If anything the story gains from the experience of the succeeding generations of scrutiny."
3,ABC Tiny Ware,"This book is very pretty, but most of the photos of the plates are so small that one will have difficulty reading them and seeing the details of each plate. I thought that was the point: to see the details of the beautiful workmanship that goes into making these lovely items. Also, the vast majority of the plates are priced at $175-250. It is if the authors plugged in a convincing number and applied it to almost every plate. If you want to read a cute little history of the life and times of 19th century England and America, with some of Germany thrown in to boot, then buy this book. Perhaps it tries to do too much: to be an encyclopedia of the times and a compendium of literally thousands of pieces of ABC ware, a price list, and a picture book. Unfortunately, for those who want to see the plate, read what's on it and know it's specific value, this book leaves one a bit wanting. However, it IS the definitive study, so until another comes along, go with it, I guess."
1,If You Like The Old Surf Classics Look Elsewhere,"I had high hopes for these CDs. Unfortunately, none of them are the original recordings and they sound terrible, especially if you liked the old studio originals. They sound more like they were re-recorded ten years after the original using Lawrence Welk's band as a backup. I'm very disapointed."
5,Very Good Anime,"This anime is very enjoyable and fuunny and Pink is so hot,Definetely recommended for every one"
3,Nothing Special but it's ok,"Typical Hammerfall like power metal, it's decent but it's nothing to kill anyone or anything over."
5,great book!,"i got this book from the library. it was a great book,but the ending was even better,i asked my mom to get it for me becuse i liked it so much. i think YOU should get this."
3,CHAGES FOR SAMANTHA,changes for samantha was a good book. it talks about a girl and 3 friends who live in an orphnage. the days that samantha visited nellie they planed to escape from the orphanage. they finally escaped. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.
4,GOOD BOOK!,"Changes for Samantha, is a wonderful adventure story. It kept me on the edge of my seat, i couldn't put the book down. That is how exciting it was! ALL of the Samantha books are very exciting! I LOVE them! So if your around 9-12 and you want adventure and fun, pick up the Samantha books. Their exciting from book 1-6! READ THEM!"
4,Helping a homeless friend,I liked this book alot.It is about a girl named Samantha who lives with her aunt and uncle while her grandma is on a cruise with her fiance.Nellies parents just died and she has too go with her uncle but then her uncle mistreats her and her sisters so now Nellie and her sisters have to go to a orphanage with a very cruel lady what else could go wrong?
3,Fair season to say the least,"The season itself starts strong.Great episodes of Dylan being lost in addiction..Valerie being the sneaky conninving bitch..of course theres the always annoying Andrea..I was so glad when she left the show..The problem with this season is that it starts off strong and ends so bad..Dylan being hypnotized,Ray being an abuser,Andrea leaving..and of course the weirdest thing of all..Kelly choosing herself..I dont know if I can recomend this season too anybody looking to purchase it.I wouldnt buy it new thats for sure..look for a cheap used copy...That way if your disapointed you can tell yourself that you didnt waste a lot of money."
3,Get what you pay for.,I had been re-watching these episodes quicker then I can order them so I decided to roll the old dice and buy some used DVD's. The second dvd is really scratched. We won't be doing THAT again. Arrived quickly though.
2,beverly hills season 5,"The Beverly Hills 90210 season 5 DVD's I bought seemed like burned copies. The quality was not very good. Overall, I still enjoyed watching them."
4,Great season...the show reinvented!,"This season picks up where the last one left off while at the same time changes everything you knew about 90210 until now. Also, you can find everything you love about the O.C. in this season, down to the grizzled construction worker in a wife beater falling for the rich snob. So good."
5,No more Brenda Walsh!,"Season 5 is great, especially since Doherty left the show. I think the character, Valerie Malone was a great addition to the show, although Jennie Garth as Kelly Taylor has always been my favorite. I think the seasons only get better after this point with Brenda Walsh out of the picture(what an annoying character.)It's sad when Andrea leaves, but at least Kelly stuck around until the end! Great season, great show, great addition to anyone's DVD collection. Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out."
3,Beverly Hills 90210 - Fifth season,The product was received very quickly in excellent condition. The product was described in a manner that made it easy to decide to buy it. There were no defects in the product and I gave it as a gift and my friend was thrilled with the product.
4,"A good CD, he has done better","Mango continues to put out very classy, melodic music, with better and more sophisticated production each time. Disincanto continues this trend. The title track, plus the first single ""Rondine"" are first rate. This may be more personal preference, but as a whole, I liked his other recent CD called ""Credo"" (1998)....his singing, the melodies and the content seemed to hit heights for which ""Disincanto"" reaches, but doesn't always grasp.The brief editorial blurb above, characterizing Disincanto as a ""very mature"" CD is apt. I wonder where he goes from here stylistically or emotionally.In short: if you're a Mango fan, all the things you like about his style will be found on this CD, but probably done elsewhere as well, and maybe a little better. Try ""Credo"" if you can find it, which I think is his most accomplished effort to date. Also, ""Mango live"" is fabulous, as is an earlier album (1992) called ""Come L'aqua""."
5,I FOUND A DEFINTION OF THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!YAY!!!!!!!!,"Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha and Jade, think it's their lucky day when they make friends with a teenage genie named Katia. She has magical powers, and best of all, she can grant wishes! But things get wild and crazy when a secret is revealed about the genie girl that thrusts the Bratz into a world of intrigue and adventure.YES THE ANIMATION IS LIKE THE ROCK ANGELZ MOVIE!!!go to bratz.com and join the club for a sneak peek!"
1,"bad- really, really, bad.","I can't say how many times they said "" FASHION "". It'sdumb. And the song, "" clothes make the girl "" is reallydumb 'cause they don't make the girl. I think theart on the boys was freaky 'cause they didn't have anynoses. The only thing they talk about is "" Boys "" and "" fashion. "" even the boys use the word "" fashion "". If youdon't like girly stuff, don't buy this. Buy mulan or atleast barbie."
1,HI!!!,I hate bratz and there's nothing u can do about it!!!!! Go worship your BRATZ dolls like a true BRATZ slave should!!!
4,this movie rocks!!!!,"i loved this movie it was so much better than the other movie ""starrin & stylin"". the only thing i didn't like about it, was how they only show jade, sasha, cloe & yasmin as the main characters. i did:nt like how meygan wasn't in the movie i mean she should be in it cause shes a genie magic doll why should'nt she be in the movie. Any way, this movie rocks!! bye!"
3,Your kids may like it,"Actually not that bad. Has a real story and a villain other than that ridiculous Burdine. The only weird thing is they confuse genies and gypsies, but your kids won't notice (or care)."
3,Skeptical,"My daughter absolutely loves the movie, but I don't feel like kids are being taught the right things. I mean they really are ""brats"" in this movie! There's theft, backstabbing, and just pure meanness in this ""kids"" movie. What are kids' movies becoming?"
5,My seven tear olds favourite movie,My little girl watches this at least twice a day - she can't get enough of it!
2,This is Kinsey speaking,I'm sorry for everything I said. I'm offering a truce and buying bratz things. Happy? I'm REALLY TRUELY SORRY.
4,pretty awesome,"This movie was really good telling about how really bratz lives are like.The charaters looked and sounded real but their clothes were kind of stupid and boring.I like the fact how dylan has a giant ego but im pretty upset about nevera,meygan,and dana only made brief appearences.This movie is great for kids and well have fun watching it."
5,I haven't seen it yet...,"But if anyone wishes to see a preview for this movie, they may visit www.bratz.com, the official bratz website. It's a cool preview. The animation is much better thatn the tv series' animation, which improves with every episode. I'm sure this movie will be as wonderful as Bratz Rock Angelz. There is either a new male in this movie, or Cameron got a major make-over! I'll keep you updated o that. Hello, Sara and Lauren! BFFL!!!Chelsea&Yasmin;(50% My Scene, 50% Bratz)over, & OUT!!!!!P.S.-END THE WAR!!!-Hannah(#1 Peacekeeper)12 YEAR OLD FAN OF MY SCENE, BRATZ, AND BARBIE"
2,please!,please! a nother bratz movie! this movie they look wireder then the rock angels. at least barbie has a nosies and real lips!
1,It's BAD!!,"Hi,I begged my mom to get this DVD. I didn't like it at all because it looked really bad, it wasn't colorful, and story wasn't good at all.(their clothes weren't cool either)I can't recomend this to my friends!!!"
1,More Dumb Crap,"I HATE BRATZ!!! Oh, sorry. My name is Kinsey. I hate bratz. They are sissies that think about NOTHING but fashion and boys. I want to ban Bratz."
5,"OH MY, this is SO bad ! ( Sarcasm : / )","Okay, you people are a bunch of little weirdos. And you, that 10 - year - old boy! What are you doin' reviewing a GIRLS movie? Huh??I'm also 10 years old . . Seriously . You people are making a big deal about something thats a waste of breath. Worry about the poulution thats in our air, or how the schools dont have enough books for us kids, or how our government is cheaping out . . . . . . Okay? So stay away and think about what i said because i'm giving my honust and true opinion."
2,rock angels is way better,hi i bought starrin n stylin and to be honest i thught it wasnt that good but my little sister liked it. but then i got rock angels and it was brilliant and not only can little kids watch it but teen girls around the age of up to 14 can also watch it and enjoy it. i did!
2,the difference a year makes,the animation on this movie was just average. The other bratz movie(rock angles) was much more fun to watch.
1,Rubbish!,"This movie was apsolutly rubbish! The animation wasn't good at all, and they say they have as ""Passion for Fashion"", hello DID YOU SEE THE CLOTHES THEY WERE WEARING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok well the formal outfits were ok, but the rest of them were just plain and boring, my wardrobe is more fashionable than theirs.The storyline was a bit boring but you did get an unexpected suprise when you discovered it was Yasmin.Oh and I noticed that the people at the prom, before the girls arrived, were just standing there and not doing anything. If the prom was bad before they came, wouldn't the teacher have done something???So over all, don't buy this. [...] Save your cash for something better."
1,Why are they running around in their underwear???,"Okay I know they're babies but why are they running around all over town in their panties??? I mean, come on, it's bad enough that the 'grown up' version of these characters are all dressed like hoochies...they have to spoil the innocence of babies by dressing them like their older counterparts WITHOUT pants to top it off? Disgusting....no wonder our society is so screwed up. Start 'em young with inappropriate behavior, dress, poor values and morals. Let's just inflate the kids heads with vanity with nothing solid inside."
4,Essential for MSK radiologist but a little dry,This remains an essential textbook for musculoskeletal radiologists although one criticism would be that is a little dry . It steers clear of the opinion which makes books by Resnick or Helms so entertaining and useful. Stoller and some of the authors he has used for the chapters are enormously experienced and it would be good to read a more personal perspective .
4,Nice Reference,The book is well written and forms a great reference. Some of the data in the book is taken from so so studies.The pictures are great. Lacking is data on the MCP joints.All in all a good reference book.
2,"Excellent art, terrible story...","I picked this one up for the art, knowing it would be a lame story, but it truly exceeded my expectations in its terrible writing. What's the point of Superman without his powers? And why bother pitting him against something just because it's popular if you're going to have to strip him down to do it? Leave the alien stories to Batman, who actually has to outwit and out fight them. Also, everything takes place in what must be the highest traffic area of the Amazon ever...I mean, how many plots do you need to fill out this terrible book? This is slapped together garbage, pure and simple. Great artwork for the most part, though. Gave it an extra star just for that."
2,good toilet-reading material,"some of the worst writing i have seen.predictable and boring.you can tell by the art that even maleev,who's doing very nice work for daredevil now,was totally uninspired by the whole story.i pity him and hope he at least got paid well.so bring it to the toilet if you run out of paper."
3,"Nice book to have, but..","Compare with ""the Asia book"", I think this book would have been the same style. To me, this book seems to show too many cities but not very deep in details. I would prefer the book to have less number of cities but present more details and pictures."
2,Beautiful Pictures; Insufferable Preachiness,"This book contains many beautiful pictures and if you are a stay-at-home world traveller you will definitely enjoy it.On the other hand, I found the politically correct preaching to be tiresome. People who buy these books are not generally interested in the author's opinions on politics and it would have been better to have left it out."
3,Not the strongest work in the Lonely Planet series.,"Actually, I'd rate this book 3.5 stars, but not 4. Nice photos. Useful information, but just not what I was looking for when I have seen lots of Lonely Planet work."
3,good but...,"really nice for some cities but i think the ranking could be much better, some cities are displayed incredihbly well for what they really are if you go and live there, other seem trashy when they are not at all...."
4,Dunlop Adaptor,Works well. I use it daily and have not had any trouble with it. I have even used it to power some non-dunlop pedals and it works on them too.
1,"""Sound enhanced"" = no original theme music!","I purchased these,not noticing the ""Sound Enhanced"" warning on them. The quality is OK (not the greatest but it'll do) BUT...the opening and closing theme music is replaced with an AWFUL version that sounds NOTHING like the original. The only reason I can figure for them doing this is that perhaps they were unable to obtain rights to air the theme song (for one reason or another). Aside from that, this is a collection of episodes NOT WORTH BUYING imo. AMC must now stand for Awful Movie Collection. If this were a movie, it'd be awful!"
4,Action near and at Corsica in 1796,"A reprint of Pope's novel first published in 1965. The action is concentrated in a very short time period (less than two weeks) in the later part of 1796, just before the British evacuation of Corsica. Ramage escapes from a sinking frigate, aids the escape of Italian refugees from the French, and then deals with the aftermath of his actions. There is a final side action on the coast of Corsica involving the grounded frigate Belette (W.P. Gosset, ""the Lost Ships of the Royal Navy, 1793-1900,"" lists the frigate Belette as ""burned at Ajaccio as unserviceable"" on 20 October 1796, along with the frigate Poulette). The action is, perhaps, a little too fast paced. At points, the author gets wrapped up in details of ship handling, but overall it is a good story with a somewhat romantic ending."
4,Good Seafaring Adventure,"I have read a number of Pope's books and have enjoyed them, including the Ramage series. Pope is an historian and his writing is very informed and his portrait of the British navy accurate. If I had any complaint it is that the Ramage books are more of the same Royal Navy fare that we have seen many times. For a more unique series, one that is just as accurate and fast paced, I recomend James L. Nelson's books about the American Navy during the American Revolution. By Force of Arms is the first in the series."
4,"A good tale, well told","Enough reviewers have gone on at length to talk about the merits of this book, so I shall be brief.This is a good story. The characters are interesting. The action is plentiful, and well written.Ramage is no Aubrey, nor is he a copy of Bolitho or Hornblower. He is a fine character in his own right.Full marks for Dudley Pope!On to Ramage & The Drumbeat!"
3,Rhymes with...,"Set in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, this is a novel much like others of that genre--or like Temeraire without dragons. The main character is a plucky young man, thrust into command despite the shame hanging over his family name. There are sea battles and small boats, an alluring foreign noblewoman, political wrangling and desperate missions. It's not really my sort of thing--too much naval jargon and maneuvering without enough wit."
2,weak,"If you enjoy naval fiction of quality (CS Forester and Patrick O'Brian for example), you are likely to be very disappointed by these books. Look at the three and two star reviews here for a fair and accurate analysis before you buy. (If you thought Alexander Kent (who wrote the foreward) was a lightweight in this genre, you may think of him more charitably after reading Pope.)"
4,A really good British sailing navy Napoleonic War era novel.,If you like the O'Brian series of novels you'll like this one. This is just number one in Pope's series of Ramage novels so there are more to look forward to. I am glad of that since I have read all of the O'Brian novels including the latest unfinished one and have no more to look forward to now.
3,Not the true color...,"Mine are lavender colored, not the dark purple color pictured. Aside from that, they are fine. ( I have had them a week or so.)"
2,Rings and Things,This ring is of OK quality. I find the sizes to run a little small. I probably wouldn't buy another of these.
2,poor quality,Bought these for myself since I like amethyst. They appear cheaply made and there is a loose stone on one of the earrings which I thankfully discovered before it was lost. Couldn't recommend them based on the poor craftmanship
2,Bad settings,"These were worn *one time* and a stone dropped out of one of the settings. They have two pronged settings in sterling silver, they just aren't pressed around the gems well, no overlap to hold the gems in place.The earrings themselves are pretty. The stones aren't well matched, but for the price I didn't expect them to be. They do have good clarity and the silver shines well. The snap closures on the hoops are well made and hold together tightly.Too bad the stones don't stay in the earrings. As it stands, it's a waste of money to buy them and risk having a ruined piece of jewelry after one or two wears."
3,MaryinNovi,"These earrings are pretty, but hard to open. I had to tug on them quite a bit to get them to open, and I thought I was going to break them. Also, the box isn't fancy, which detracts from giving these as a gift."
1,Looks are deceiving!,"These earrings are way smaller than I anticipated and two of the stones fell out as soon as I removed them from the velvet pouch. This was not a good choice on my part...but I love everything PURPLE! If they had cost more than I would considered returning them, but it's not worth it."
3,Pretty but bad quality,I bought these for my mom.. who loved to have a pair of amethyst earrings. Unfortunately two of the stones fell out before she even wore them. We had to return them.
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","I found the German idealistic readings of the Ring insufferably pompous. They left me with a feeling of utter disgust both with Wagner's mistake at having gotten involved with the whole thing in the first place and with Kohler, for taking it's philosophical pretensions so seriously, with nary a single intelligent comment re the MUSIC. HOWEVER, the devastating critique of the oft-mentioned (not least by W) Wagner/Schopenhauer connection, and the much-deserved and well-documented trashing of Cosima make the book very worthwhile in spite of the aforementioned."
5,Awesome crayons....certainly not just for kids!,"I received a set of these crayons as a gift.Pros: awesome quality, vivid colors, semi-blendable/layerable (you could never blend or layer crayolas!).Cons: They're back-to-back crayons. So if you use a lot of pressure like I do, you're likely to snap the crayons apart, and be stuck working with little nubbin crayons...which still works just fine for me, but perhaps not for you.Overall still the most fun and workable crayons i've used to date."
1,Old News,"I was very disappointed in this book. Most of the information given is easily found on the internet for free. I thought there would be more tips on getting out of debt, but most of the book seemed to be about credit reports. I would not recommend this book at all. Just do some searches on the internet and you'll be able to get the same info. Or just borrow this book from your local library - just don't waste your money buying it."
2,Too broad,"Sitka is not typical of Louis L'Amour's work. He takes us from Louisiana to San Francisco to Alaska to Russia and back to Alaska in a relatively short book. In doing all this traveling with his character, Jean Labarge, we do not get the typical Louis L'Amour descriptions. We do not get a good description of Sitka, Alaska or its inhabitants. We do not even get a good adventure. When Labarge's warehouse with his very valuable wheat is set ablaze by the bad guys, he does not even go after them. Instead, he sends his ship to Alaska on schedule while he heads overland, on a miraculously fast journey, to Oregon where a sufficient quantity of wheat just happens to be available. In my opinion, the whole story is too far-fetched with too many scenes and not enough of the kind of action and adventure Mr. L'Amour has always delivered."
5,gift for grandpa,"Item was shipped quickly, arrived on time. The books were recieved were all in good quality. My grandpa was very pleased with this purchase."
1,Sitka,Book had been recommended by a friend . First L . Lamour I'd ever read .Not my kind of reading . Way too improbable story .
3,"Wonderful Saturday-afternoon Matinee B-movie...er, book","Poverty-stricken beginnings, climbing to wealth, mountain men, sailing, naval adventures, a princess, prison, politics, good Indians, bad Russians, and the great Alaskan frontier. What more could you want from a swashbuckling quick summer read? L'Amour gives us what we've come to want from him: quick, hearty fare that's not too complicated but will get you through the night."
2,Give me a break!,"Reading Louis L'Amour should be fun--not embarassing. This book covers so much ground (in addition to Alaska we have a transcontinental sleigh rides across Siberia, sea voyages to China and a court appearance in Moscow) and is so improbable (a minor character from Virginia becomes a US senator from Mississippi who is the true catalyst of the Alaskan purchase (and what about the Civil War?)) that the usual L'Amour bravery, romance, and high drama--which is indeed here--is lost in the shuffle. What was he thinking?"
3,Good luck finding a replacement battery,"We bought two of these 1.5 years ago for use on long trips. We've been VERY happy with them...until now....it appears both batteries have died: these have never been left in the heat/car...and I can't find a replacement battery anywhere. They still work on AC, but not in the car with the car adapter. HMMMMMM."
1,Disappointed,Two days after I got it stopped working. I am out 70 dollars. Instead of watching movies I have a very big paper weight
1,UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY FIANCE AS A FATHERS DAY GIFT. WHEN HE RECEIVED IT IT WAS ALL SCRATCHED AND WOULD NOT PLAY ANY OF HIS DVD'S. I WAS ABLE TO RETURN IT RATHER EASILY AND RECEIVED A FULL REFUND.
4,Good Product,I have had this DVD player for about two weeks and so far am very happy with it. The picture is good and so is the sound. I agree with another reviewer that headphones should have been included but I just used an old pair from an old walkman that doesn't work any longer. Good product at a good price.
4,The Division of Labor in Society,I received the book in a timely fashion and it was properly prepared for shipment.
3,Durable cover with some flexibility,"This cover is made from a durable material that seems to wear well in the weather. However, the sizing leaves a bit to be desired. Although the cover is one of the better ones that I have owned, there are not enough clasps or straps to completely secure it to the air conditioner unit. Then, again, I may have been expecting more from it and was somewhat disappointed. I suppose that if you took the time to be really careful with the cover and fold everything under well before closing the straps that you might have better success than I did."
5,Where to really buy the book,"George Gillson is publishing the book periodically himself now. If you go to www.Dube.com, they will order a copy of the book from him. They charge $12.95 plush S&H. My wife found this out by emailing George Gillson himself. He actually answered her back with the info. What a great guy. Good luck. Egon"
1,A search engine in book form,"Written many years ago and is basically a printed and bound search engine results, providing you the URL location answers to your questions. Okay, topics and subjects are nicely grouped together - so it's a lot faster than using Goggle - but how up-to-date is the information, given how often websites come, change, and go? I returned my copy within 60 minutes after the mailman dropped it off."
1,Huge Dissappointment,"I ordered this as a birthday gift for my GF. From the pictures, it looked beautiful, but as soon as I opened the package, I was hugely disappointed and my first thoughts were ""I can't give her this!!"".First, I expected a perfume bottle to be ""delicate"" looking but this one is big and feels clunky. Also, I expected the stopper to be tapered and fit snugly into the bottle, and have a ""dabber"" at the end for applying the perfume. In this bottle, my first thought was that they shipped the wrong stopper! The dabber was about half the diameter of the opening of the bottle and so short that the bottle would have to be filled almost to the top to reach the perfume.Quality was another issue. OK, this isn't such an expensive bottle to expect perfection, but the bottle that I received had a very obvious (and not so pretty) bubble in it, as well as a small chip on one of the four flat surfaces.I don't usually write such negative reviews but this item was so disappointing on so many levels."
5,Highly effective,If you really need this product it works quite well. It should be prescribed by someone knowledgeable in Chinese herbs.
5,Great Anime!!!,"You guys will love this anime. I love the story and everything that happens in it. If your wondering what it is about, well I can say it is a bit political but at the same time a ""chick flick."" It has romance and comedy in it. The animation is wonderful."
4,Ludlum does not disappoint. Know this is an early one though.,"This is a fast-paced read but short. In true Ludlum fashion, though an early book, suspense, conspiracy and desperation are center. I was prompted to re-read this one after I recently read a short story called ""Betters Inc."" that has a lot of the similar ingredients, just more concentrated. Reading an early Ludlum book is like settling back in your slippers, you just got home... A very good read, if a bit dated."
4,"Clever, Intriguing and Fun","The book starts out with murder and deception. A TV host of a 60 Minutes type show, is being summoned to Washington under false pretences and convinced by the CIA that his friends are conspiring against the country. The host, John Tanner, invites his friends to his home for the weekend in order for the traitor to reveal themselves so the CIA could capture them.This is a clever, intriguing and fun book which has glimmers of the genius which Robert Ludlum is about to become. The characters come to life, even though not all of them are likeable or pleasant.I've enjoyed this book (not as much as I enjoyed Ludlum's later releases) simply because it intrigued me, the characters were interesting and the plot was fascinating since both the reader and the main character have no idea what's going on.Even though the book might seem thick, as are most of Ludlum's books, it is a quick read and a page turner."
4,Not Bad...,"I enjoyed reading it but it lacked oomph at certain parts... Still, I didn't put the book down until I finished it. So, to all Ludlum fans out there...just read it."
3,a look back,"This book is good, considering the time period in which it was written. In 1972, this was probably the ultimate in thriller novels; however, by 2002, it's a little light.The Osterman weekend is a weekend when 4 couples gather to hang out. The Ostermans are from California, and seem to be the glue that holds all of this together. John Tanner, one of the group, is approached by the CIA stating that the Ostermans are really involved in organized crime, as are the other members of the group.The story if full of miscalculations, deception, and cross-betrayals. By the end, you just want a list of who is actually involved in the nefarious group, and who isn't.but then again....."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A man hosting a weekend long party and getaway for a group of friends gets an unpleasant surprise when he is told that his friends are spies and traitors. He doesn't believe it at first, but the weekend degenerates into a whole pile of problems and nastiness as this CIA prediction unfortunately for him, becomes true."
1,Beware the Kindle edition!,"The Kindle edition is missing the introduction, which explains how to use the book, and it's also missing about 10 other pages of the actual content. Also, it's low-res, fuzzy and very hard to read the small numbers inside the dots, on a tablet. I just got a refund from amazon.com though, and that process was very easy and quick, so kudos to them for that."
5,LOVED THE ORIGINAL,"I tried the first Hilton Head Metabolism Diet and it was great! I lost 25lbs 3 years ago and even after having my second child I have not gained back the weight. I have several friends that have gone on the diet also and have lost and kept off lots of weight. I am excited about trying the new book, I'm sure it's even better. I have about 10 more lbs I want to lose and I'm sure this will do the trick"
5,The Best collection of diet & nutrition advice in print!,"I recommend this to all of my patients who are trying to lose weight and stay fit. David W. Fairbanks, M.D."
2,"Good Ideas, Terrible Food","I purchased this book after reading the many excellent reviews it received. Alas and alak, it was disappointing. Not so much the actual diet he describes, but the menus were horrendous and the plan was way too rigid. Would not recommmend."
1,The New HILTON HEAD Metabolism DIET,I can't rate this book because as of to date I haven't received. I bought it on the 7th of June. It's now the 8th of July and I'm still waiting.
5,We lost a total of 19 pounds the first week!,"My mom, sister, and I bought the book and went on the diet together. My mom lost 2 pounds, I lost 5, and my sister lost 12! My sister having the most fat to lose. We all love the recipes in the back of the book. We find we don't have to cheat on this diet and we continue to drop weight. I am starting week 3 and have dropped a total of 9 pounds. The twice daily exercise gets tuff at times but the results keep me going. Also, I have to remind myself to keep my exercise comfortable and enjoyable...like the book says to do. I can do this diet as a way of life. Good luck isn't needed for those of you who buy this book. You will get the results you are looking for."
2,Good if you are an engineer,"You would think a noose wouldn't need instructions, but I just couldn't get it to stay around my dog. I returned the product.While I didn't like the product, the company was great to work with and gave me no hassle in returning the product."
4,Recommended for religion survey courses,"This textbook not only looks at the history of different religions, but it also shows you the contemporary version/manifestation of each religion. As an instructor, I found this very easy for my students to understand and relate to.One of the strongest points of this text is the interviews with different contemporary people to explain religious belief. An example of this would be an interview with Ann-Ping Chin on Confucianism in today's society. This is much easier for students to relate to than using discussions of ancient religious leaders only.Each chapter has a list of suggested readings, which I found very useful in preparing discussions. The publisher also has a web-site with exercises and links for each chapter to assist students in studying the different religions.I would recommend this book."
2,Too Confusing,"This was not a beginner's video at all. If you are out of shape you will not be able to keep up. Furthermore, the movements go by too fast. By the time you start to get one move down, the next has come up and you are scrambling to keep up. Then there is the fact that many of the moves are combinations, expecting you to move forward and back, up and down, while shaking your hips and adding arm movements. Many of the moves aren't clearly shown in the video, making it even harder to follow along.I am sure that with a lot of practice I could eventually get the moves of this video down, but as someone just starting to get in shape again, I found that it was too frustrating to try. I will move on to another exercise dance dvd instead."
4,Challenging,"This dvd and the whole series are great for working on isolations. This particular workout was the most difficult for me to follow. I'm an intermediate bellydancer and was able to do most of the workouts until she does some combinations towards the end that just got too confusing and she didn't really explain what she was doing. Other than that, she works on the hip isolations which really refine doing the maia (figure 8). This video is challenging yet do-able. The dvd comes with special features which includes a bonus mini workout, a solo performance, a performance by her entire troupe and circle dance. Her students in the video are very talented and the workout motivates you to get to their level. Oh, and strangely there is a random part where she talks about her pregnancy.I recommend her pilates or yoga dvd over this one."
1,This movie should be dubbed!,I feel like she sped through this video. It is impossible to learn any steps when she is teaching. She does her glute exercises as quickly as she teaches these dance moves... for her that may be good but for us BEGINNERS it is dreadful! This series really is not for beginners and there really is no belly dance instruction!!!!
1,Boring,"To be fair, I must admit I did not finish watching this video. It opens with some standard stretching, and then moves on to the ""exotic fusion of jazz and bellydance moves"" - calf raises. Finally, it moves to a recognizable dance move, hip shimmies. But it lingers on the many variations: half time, at tempo, on one leg, add a clap. Maybe it gets better, but I'll never know. I moved to another video before this one put me to sleep."
5,"To put it simply,","this is the finest stroller we have ever had (after the purchase of 5 other strollers!) I only wish they made them in double and tripple versions (for multiple children). We have NO complaints, and our daughter (2.5) ADORES this stroller. It is the only one she has ever liked!"
1,Beware,"Beware of cd's with no song listing. I bought this based on another buyer's review that mentioned a few song titles, but the cd I received was titled Country Christmas but none of the songs mentioned were on it. Moral to story: I'm sure there are tons of different Country Christmas cd's out there so without a song list you're buying a pig-in-a-poke"
4,Great Modernist text,I would recommend this book to anyone interested in New Mexico and the Southwest more generally. A story about life change in the desert is a compelling read by Mary Austin.
3,OF ALL THE KIM WATERS ALBUM THIS IS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST,"Someone at the record company must have thought this project would help him crossover...This crossed him over, but to the wrong side. The 2 (Two) shining moments are Vocal Tracks with the late O.C. Smith singing, outside of those...The rest are very rather pale. There wasn't even 1 (One) Charted Billboard Single released from this Album, so that should also tell you something."
5,No complaints,We bought this a year ago and it still works. That more than what you can say about most cheap electronics you buy online!
3,"A lot of fun, but got a lemon","I have to say, the Wii remote is a great controller. Really simulates swinging you arm very realistically in baseball and the other Wii games. I had no problems with it, but over a week ago it began acting up and now the motion sensing stopped working completely. Funny thing is the cursor still works. I tried all the troubleshooting steps in the manual and nothing fixed it. Luckily I'm still under the 1 year hardware warranty so I sent it back t get a replacement controller (I've only had it 6 months and I only use it for about 30 min every other day). The customer support was a helpful and sent out a new one. Hopefully this one will last a bit longer! lol"
5,Limited Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Wiimote (WII REMOTE) is a great item. Although, when you purchase a Wii, you receive 2 Panosonic Batteries (unrechargeable). I played the Wii for 4 days. On the 4th day it had a small amount of power left. I recommend you buy rechargeable NiMH batteries, just so you won't have to keep buying, and buying batteries. This is from my experience.NY- Anish"
5,Wii controller -no game with this just controller!,We received this controller so fast - ordered on a Saturday and it arrived on Monday or Tuesday! Totally awesome delivery and everything was perfect! Very impressed!! Thank you!
4,Nintendo made a solid remote controller,"This remote can take a beating. When I first got mine, it went flying so many times and didn't even break. The detection is a little off still but with a update of firmware from nintendo on the wii, it so be great. The other down side is do not use rechargable batteries. The charge gets drained very fast and is also not recommended by nintendo."
5,Wii remote controller,Hola!!! Gracias Amazon por acercarme este control. Con el puedo disfrutar a pleno las bondades de la consola Wii y jugar con mis hijos y amigos. Es el complemento que me faltaba para jugar de a dos.Gracias de nuevo!!!
1,SCAM!!!SCAM!!!!SCAM!!!!!,"This is a pure scam. Theses are not even real wii controllers! I got ripped off for 60 + dollars. They don't even share the same marks as a real wii contoller. They wouldn't even link up to the wii. They had cineses writing all over the box (not what the picture looks like) When i put the batteriesa in, it wouldn't evenm light up. No return address. no contact email. Just a 100% scam. Never had this kind of thing happen to me on Amazon. Don't know if I will do business with them anymore because they let jelly knecked, gibbereing mororns like this guy to operate freely. And had i been smart and read the reviews, i would have know this was a scam. Countless others have been ripped off by this guy too."
1,never worked,"Purchased this remote for Christmas, it has never worked. I thought at first it was the batteries. After many sets of batteries and efforts to resolve operator error in set up I now know it was and is broken. Purchase with caution."
2,Faulty,The buttons are stuck and are really harrd to press. I think they shouldve atleast cleaned it before sending it out.
5,Very Durable,"Wiimotes are great. They're fun and very durable.While playing tennis with a friend, the Wiimote flew out of his hand at a very high speed and smashed into the wall. We thought for sure that it had shattered and exploded.It didn't. What we saw was th battery cover flying off and the batteries flying out. They were scattered far across the room, but the Wiimote did not crack and worked perfectly afterwards. We're so glad he didn't hit my dad's new tv.I'd still recommend getting the free covers from nintendo.com"
5,Greate Wii remote controller,The product was as described. It works wonderful with Wii. We received the product a week earlier than I had expected. It was a very good shopping experience.
4,"Good product, GREAT customer service","I ordered two of these remotes from Prime Ventures. The first set I received had a problem connecting to the console that would cause the game to hang in the middle of play. The seller responded almost instantly to my email inquiry about their return policy and sent out replacements right away. I was very impressed with their quick and courteous service.The remotes themselves work well, with one caveat: unlike the remotes that came with the system, they have to be manually connected each time the console is turned on. This seems to be a feature of the remote, as I have seen this comment in several reviews."
3,Wi owner,Had to buy this because some of the newer games require this attached in order to play the game.
5,works,for the reasons i bought this for it works like it should kids needed another remote for there Wii so we could play 4 player games
5,This Is EPIC!,"Since I couldn't play dbz bt3 at that time, I played Pokemon Battle Revolution with the Wiimote I got off Amazon and I have 3 words to say.THIS WORKED PERFECTLY!For hours, I was playing with a smile on my face. I was really happy with my deal. :)"
5,it works well in my Wii. I'm satisfied with this item.,it works well in my Wii. I'm satisfied to have chosen Nintendo original controller. My son also like it very much..
3,Sweet,It's cheaper than some places. I like how long it tool to get here. It was brand new. No damages to it. I like it.
5,great !,"this is awesome ! ... the fact that there are no cable's just incredible, it makes you be part of the game, and that's something no one had ever done til now ... :)"
1,"Please a better quality ""Control"" in Nintendo products","I bought a Wii 4 moths ago, I decided to buy an extra control in Amazon but unfortunately it only worked 3 days, now it dose not turn on (of curse the batteries are new). I live in México and is hard to me require a warranty. Nintendo should have a better quality ""CONTROL"" in their products."
3,Somewhat Useful,"The Wiimote is somewhat useful, except for Smash Brothers. Then it is a suitable handicap for professional and semi-pro players vs. casual players."
2,Shipping changes too high,"The control is great, and playing with the Wii it's a lot of fun. The thing I have never understand about Amazon is the shipping charges. It has never been consistant, since Puerto Rico is sometimes intenational and other times domestic.A small and light item can cost a lot in shippin while a big a heavy can cost less. I have been quote almost 50% of the cost of the item in shipping charge, that is when the item can be sent to PR. To buy I always need to quote the shipping charges to determine if it is a good deal."
1,Empty box,"I wish I could review this product but when my package came in, the box was empty and the product wasn't in there.I was very upset to the point that I decided not to deal with it and to not order from amazon."
1,wii remote controller,the remote came quickly and worked as a second remote for 2 days after which time it did not respond correctly at all. no way to callibrate it and it is useless. we are very upset that this was a waste of money!
4,Excellent delivery time,I order the product and receive it in less than 5 days with standard shipping
5,wii game,it is the first game that I know of that the whole family can enjoy and also you can get your exercise with . it gets a couch pottato up an moving. family needs to spend more time together.
5,Excellent device!,There's not much to say about this controller. A complete interactive way to enjoy your games with your family and friends.
3,works OK alongside our original controller,I was thinking to get a Motion Plus enabled controller but this works perfectly well alongside our original (MP) controller. Much cheaper and maybe not worth spending extra for MP.
4,Pretty good~,"Really needed another Wii remote to play 2 player games. There are times when the signals strays and syncing the remotes many times is pretty annoying, hopefully not having anything to do with this particular remote..."
4,Korean Wii-mote,Its a Wii-mote. It works. Kinda funny thing is that the entire packaging is in Korean. I don't read or speak Korean so its a good thing I knew how to work the Wii-mote.
1,WII REMOTE DOESN'T WORK,"I received my extra remote in record time, however it doesn't work. How do I go about getting this issue fixed???"
3,Broke My TV!,I was playing with this thing and it flew right out of my hand and broke my BRAND SPANKING NEW TV. Cracked right down the middle. Definitely learned my lesson. I will never play the Nintendo Wii with baby oil on the controller.
1,dont buy this,this thing broke the first time i used it...i opened up my wii and started playing wiisports and this thing broke the first time i tried to do a strike....dont buy this!!!!
1,Didn't work,"I received the remote controller on time. I couldn't use it for about 3 weeks because my Wii console was not ready. So when I finnaly had the chance to use it, it wouldn't work. Since the item was new, I had faith it would work. I had thrown the box and everything else that came with it out by then. So now I have to buy another one, but not through Amazon."
1,piece of junk,"When my controller finally arrived, it didn't work. We tried the batteries that came in the packet, new ones, and the battery pack. Now I don't know how to send it back for an Exchange. Any suggestions? My advice? Never order electronics on Amazon."
5,A must for Wii system,"Since Nintendo Wii package only includes only one set of Wiimote and Nunchuck, additional set is a must to play together. I ordered from amazon after short researching in the market. It's tax free and a few dollars cheaper than other places so it's the best price I've come across so far.The package came perfectly normal and works nicely."
1,Not sure about Jcmods...,"The Wii Remote Controller was exactly what I ordered. However, it does not work. It was not shipped in the original package, and when I went to sync it to the console it would not show the curser on the screen. I've attempted to contact Jcmods for some sort of return/refund but they have no return policy or phone number and do not reply to emails. Bottom line I got what I ordered it just does not work, so be careful when/if purchasing from Jcmods."
1,Fake?,"The remote is really bad quality and when you compare it to the original that comes with the system you can tell it is not the same. Look at the home and A buttons, they are not the same as on the original. The sound and rumble pack don't work correctly. I returned it for a new one and it was also bad. Don't buy Wii remotes from Amazon, their supplier is screwing them/us."
1,DID NOT WORK FOR CHRISTMAS!!!,"I bought this supposedly 'brand new' remote so that my kids could play their new Wii on Christmas morning. Guess what? The piece of crap remote will not even turn on...I am so pissed off and my kids are disappointed that they have to share a remote and can't play against each other. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY...they packaged a used, defective remote and gave it to me and said it was new."
5,recommend getting one,I would highly recommend getting an extra wii remote. Mainly for the fact that the regular wii game only comes with one remote. If you want to do multiplayer on the wii than you need to have an extra remote.If you would like to us the wii with more than one person you need the remote. It's just like the remote that comes with the wii. They didn't change anything. Still works just fine. Uses regular batteries that are nice to keep around. If you don't plan on using the wii with other people then maybe you don't need this controller. An extra controller makes you feel more secure though. You can't forget that.
2,Not sure if genuine Wii product,"I ordered two of these remotes as Christmas gifts and just received them today. Much to my surprise, all packaging (and the manual, groan) is in Korean...a language I cannot read. I have to wonder if these are even real Wii remotes. I'll have the recipients test them out on Christmas and return if we run into problems, but I have no idea why I was sent these knock-off looking remotes (though they did come in boxes...also in Korean) instead of what I thought I was paying for."
2,Not as pictured,"I specifically ordered this model as a gift because it was pictured in the authentic, original packaging. It arrived in a brown cardboard box and in a small plastic bag. I have no idea whether or not this is actually a Nintendo product."
5,Love the product.............,I love the quality of the product might take some time to get use to but all in all good.
1,Cheap Chinese knockoff,"Like other reviews; I received a cheap Chinese knockoff. Mine came with instructions, but the only word (or symbol for that matter) that I can read is ""Wii"" and ""White"". Wish I had seen the negative reviews first."
3,Buyer beware,"Well, you can see the picture here - its a Wii remote in the legit company packaging. That IS NOT what I got. We ordered 2 remotes and they came in plain, white cardboard boxes with no mention of Nintendo or Wii on them.I'm now left to wonder if I got real-deal goods or knock-offs???"
5,Great for my son,"I bought this for my son I am happy to have saved a few dollars, hes 5 so if he flings and drops it its fine. We got it for the fin mcmissile wheel and sticker set and it works great"
5,WII Controller--No Complaints,Wii Remote ControllerThe controller is great and came with cover. No complaints.
5,Buying a good product while saving $ is the way to go!,"For a special birthday, I gave my son's family a new Wii but didn't want to spend store prices for the extra Wii remotes. So I checked out Amazon.com and ordered three used remotes from the large selection of sellers that they offered. I saved so much money by going through Amazon.com. Will order through them the next time the need arises."
5,exelent,the seller did ecxelent agreed with everything great and the product was exactly what I was looking for. perfect
4,Muy bueno,Excelente funciona bien pero el unico inconveniente fue que cuando me lo enviaron lo mandaron solo en una bolsa
1,i received a bad quality.... disappointed,"bought this as second remote, but it has loose connection with battery. If we insert Battery and close the battery cover, it stop working. Again i need to hold the battery to make it to work... never expected this quality for this branded product. Otherwise, i liked the Wii and Amazon serviceI will be getting replacement within a weeks time"
4,Excellent just like the one that comes with the Wii,This controller is just like the one that comes with the Wii in the original box with the clear grip that fits great in your hand. Works great!
5,Fab fun for 4,"I got the Wii system for my family of 7 adults and we wanted to play Tennis doubles so ordered 2 extra Wii remotes. We have had sooo much fun, the remotes work fabulously well."
4,Controller review,"Compared to the other gaming systems, I love this controller. It is very easy to use. My 5yr old granddaughter mastered the use of this controller in about 30 mins. Everyone in our family loves the controller configuration and has enjoyed playing it since we got it."
3,Worked as expected after replacement,"First one I received did not want to work for certain hand motion. Because of Amazon excellent Customer Service, they replaced for free including no shipping charges. The new I received works well as expected. Over all, we are happy with it."
1,BEWARE!!! Ecoshopping sells junk!,"In April 2010 I purchased a new Wii controller from ECOSHOPPING via Amazon.com. It was hardly used at all and in July I noticed that it didn't work. I've tried rechargeable and new alkaline batteries and it's just plain dead, no lights, nothing. With shipping, I think this controller was about $27, which was a pretty good deal at the time, but not for lasting only about 4 months of very little use. I recently contacted ECOSHOPPING who finally replied only to say that I should have contacted them within ""half a month"" of the purchase for them to help, otherwise they would do nothing. Of course, the controller was still working after ""half a month"". Anyway, my advice to Amazon shoppers is to keep ECOSHOPPING in mind and ask yourself if you want to take the chance spending your hard-earned money on extremely poor quality, but cheap products. I know I won't. Remember, you usually get what you pay for."
1,Flea Market item?,"Epic? Does it work? I don't even know. I don't own a Wii system. Bought this as part of a gift. In the picture display, it shows the item in Wii packaging/box. What I received was a control wrapped in thin cushion wrap. How do you give a gift that looks like it's been used. Where is the box packaging? This is misleading advertising."
3,Fun...but Nintendo is sucking us dry!,"The Wii controller is a lot of fun, but you need to factor in Nintendo's pricing when you have a family (or friends). At $80 per controller (Wii Remote, Wii Nunchuk, and the fix in sensitivity that they're charging us for...MotionPlus) a family of 4 has to shell out another $260 to play together. Overall it's fun and a good product, but not worth the cost...Nintendo needs to offer us a better value."
5,great product!,"the only problem was that it did not come in the original package, but it has worked perfectly!"
4,WEEEEEEE games,I bought this Wii Remote Controller from Amazon because I knew I could get it at a better price than at a retail store. It's great and it cost less and I received it within days of ordering it with free shipping. Can't beat the price!
5,Excellent,"fulfillment-solutions is who we chose out of the different sellers to buy this from. It arrived sealed in a factory package with Wiimote, rubberized cover, safety strap, booklet & batteries. BRAND NEW & working fine. This was a fantastic deal for twenty-seven dollars & eighty-eight cents DELIVERED!!! Other local discount places wanted thirty-four dollars & ninety-eight cents PLUS TAX! Would buy from this dealer again for sure. Watch out for some of the sellers selling the item out of box or without cover etc. fulfillment-solutions fullfilled this order exactly as advertised."
3,Faulty remote,I bought two of the Wii Remotes from this seller and one of them is faulty. When you press the right button to move it instead triggers the up button. My family and I love to bowl on the Wii and this defect makes it very difficult for us. It works well otherwise.
4,Wiimote,I wish I would have purchased the PLAY w/ Wiimote so I could have received the additional games.
5,Wii Controlers,I couldn't find Wii controlers anywhere and then thought to look at amazon. I ordered 3. They came in only a few days where they had said it could take up to 2 weeks. We were so happy when they came so fast!!
2,Total Knock Off,"I just noticed it the other day, as I havnt really looked at them closely but the Wii Controller I got from Amazon is a knock off.It has all the same markings, but you can tell by the power, home and A buttons that this was a knock off. Hopefully it will lastlong than some peoples remotes on here."
3,Wii Remote Controller,Recieved product very quickly. Best deal I could find anywhere including shipping. Will definitely buy from this seller again. Very satisfied.
4,The shipment was fast but came with a minor flaw,This Wii controller arrived very fast and it was as described but when I turned it the last one of the bottom blue lights didn't work 4 out of 5
3,wrong product,"We ordered the Wii motion remote controller and received the regular remote. I know this wasn't a mistake on our part because there was a cheaper choice and we noticed it did not say motion controller, so we chose this one which was about $10 more. Seller needs to respond to let us know how we can correct the situation."
4,Remotes are as advertised,I recently purchased 2 Wii remote controllers and I am completely satisfied. These are NOT knock-offs or repaired remotes. They were both brand new and worked right out of the box (after installing batteries of course). I am ordering 2 more right now.
5,Basic Wii Remote,"What is there to say, it's your basic wii controller. No problems, bought this about 4 yrs ago and no issues. Would recommend."
3,thought this was new?,"The controller is fine, but it didn't come in real packaging, and it wasn't supposed to be used. It was sold as ""new"". And it's a bit less sensitive/responsive than the controller I bought from a retail store, so I don't know what to think. . .I decided to keep it because it's a hassle having to return things."
2,get what you pay for.,It was an old model. A really old model. Thats what I get for trying to get used remotes instead of new ones.
5,Cheapest price around for Wii remotes,"What can you say about a Wii remote? About the only thing to add is that Amazon.com did have the cheapest price out of anybody (including Wal-mart, where I even receive a whopping 10% discount). I used the Super Saver shipping and had them shipped free. Sure, the wait was a bit longer, but for me, there was no rush as long as I got them. Check your prices, then come back to Amazon to buy!!!"
4,Great Game Bad Strap,Great remote with ultra cheap wrist band.Broke after one week.The remote hit a trunk but was durable enough to survive the impact.I recondmend making a home-made wrist band.I only gave it four stars in overall because of the faulty strap that came with the remote.
2,poor,"this wii remote was a knock-off, imatation, not made by Apple, It did not work correctly. not able to return."
2,Wii Remote Controller,"This was a present for my daughter, to supplement her game. It shipped and was received much quicker than quoted, and it works great.Thanks for the great service.D. in Texas."
3,YOU CAN'T TRUST ALL SELLERS,"I ORDERED REMOTES FROM COREDATA BECAUSE THEY OFFERED THE LOWEST PRICE. WHEN I GOT THEM THERE WAS WHITE-OUT IN THE NINTENDO STAMP AND THE WII STAMP HAD SCRAPES ON IT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN COVERED UP ALSO.I CONTACTED THE SELLER AND HE APOLOGIZED AND SENT OUT MORE REMOTES, BUT THEY WERE IN THE SAME CONDITION."
3,Good Product! Great Deal!,This was a great buy for us...we recieved the wii remote with in 3-4 days shipping time and were pleasantly surprised to see it looked brand new! We replaced the batteries and got to playing with the kids. No problems with the product and the price was good. With all the extra accessories you can buy for the wii; it's a good idea to buy in to some used accessories. This one worked great for us and we saved $$$!!
3,I chose three stars only because the controls work.,"I buy one of these used but said it was ""like new"". When it arrived I noticed that the controller did not seem original looked more like a Chinese control."
5,Regrettable experience with this seller,My experience with fridayplay (fridayplay I beilevee is the name of this seller). I bought 3 remote controllers. One of them was not working and still not working. I tried to contact the seller after I contacted a Nitendo technician who concluded that the remote was defective and inoperable. I never got a response from them up until now despite their claim of working with buyers to solve the issue or even refunding me the full amount paid for the defective controller. I submitted a complaint to Amazon with no success. I really regret having had to do business with this seller. How can I get my money back?
1,Deception!,"Emiliana Torrini's ""Love in the Time of Science"" was the best album I ever purchased. Conversely, Fisherman's Woman was the worst album I ever bought. The tunes on this album are redundant. There seems to be no variety. I can appreciate mellow music but this is just plain dull. I was so dissapointed upon hearing this album. It's depressing because I think she is an excellent artist. I just dont know what happened this time."
1,Not Crazy about this Album,I bought this album after reading all the great reviews. Apparently her first album was more trip-hop which I love. But I also like mello. But these songs lack interesting lyrics or unique vocals. Very dissapointed. All the songs sound a like so if you don't like the first song you won't like any of them. Too bad.
4,The best of Emiliana.,"In my opinion, this is the best of Emiliana Torrini's albums because of the heavy folk and acoustic influences that dominated the songs. It was much more subtle and beautiful than Love in the Time of Science while being much less poppy than Me and Armini. The tracks Heartstopper and Serenade are my personal favourites, and I love the whimsical, darker lyrics that were present a lot in Dead Things and Baby Blue from her previous album.So, if you are into softer singing, whispery almost, and acoustic backings, this is the album for you. It's very relaxing and beautiful."
5,She's The Best and This CD Proves Why:,I have all of the CDS from this gifted artist. This CD is ny second favorite of her 3 that I have. Every song is a jewel. If you like good quality music which makes you drift off into a romantic world than get this CD and play it with that someone special.
3,More personal,"Obviously the constant trip-hop references seems to be consciously eschewed here for organic instrumentation which does lend a bit more authenticity, but still evades true musical insight with minimalist guitar strumming augmenting this centerpiece voice in effective if underwhelming composition"
3,"not bad, quite mellow and melodic","I really like ""Sunnyroad"".The rest don't grab me, but it's great girly, nice, background music."
4,Give it a second listen...,"Drawn in by ""Sunnyroad"", I at first had a hard time deciding whether or not I really liked this album. The more I listened to it, though, the more favorite songs I picked up including ""Serenade"" and ""Heartstopper"". Now I'm definitely sorry I missed out on Emiliana's appearance here in Seattle. Admittedly, I haven't listened to any of her other albums, but Emiliana has definitely gained a permanent spot in my music collection."
5,Fabulous find,"(Written by my wife) My husband is very hard to buy a birthday present for and this CD was the perfect gift. You cannot buy this CD at any store and did not think I could find it. When I saw it on Amazon, I was thrilled. We have listened to it several times and it is just great--all of the songs, not just the featured album song, Harlem Nocturne (which is our favorite)."
2,"Cup of Kofi, Cream and Sugar","This is easy listening ""jazz."" Too close to Kenny G and Michael Feinstein for my tastes. It's played expertly, but the music never challenges, never takes you on a journey. It will offend no one, but frankly I don't even want this in the background when I'm dining. I'd sooner grab an old Tom Scott album. Many many find this soothing and relaxing, and I cannot argue with that. But if your taste runs toward Coltrane, or the Brecker Brothers, or Wynton Marsalis, you will find this cup of Kofi to be pretty weak."
3,decent,"They aren't earth shattering but if you want to save space and save some cash these are okay. If you want something that will really save space and move some air, try the JL Audio shallowmount. Prepare to dig deep it those pockets though."
3,Ya Gotta Read At Least ONE Mike Hammer Book!,"Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer was such a huge phenomenon in the early 50s that you'll miss out on all sorts of references in popular culture if you don't read him-- at least one of his inimitably gritty books. This is as good as any (though the first, ""I, The Jury,"" is the most logical start). Mike is a full-bore psychopath who hears music in his head when he's gone nuts for violence, who relishes beating and blowing big holes in people whom he's identified as deserving it: commies mostly, but criminals and egg-headed pantywaists of all descriptions had better watch it too. This is beyond parody, since Spillane's writing is already so loopy that it can't be made fun of effectively. But the guy sold FIFTY MILLION BOOKS in a few years' time in the early fifties, so it's impossible to overestimate his effect on the culture of the time.No joke: read one and see. It's good fun, though the plots are a bit transparent by contemporary standards."
3,Narrow but well made.,These run too narrow over the arch of the foot. Keep this in mind when ordering.Aside form that they seem well constructed and comfortable.
4,Colors are great,"I read the reviews before buying these shoes and every one said how tight they were. I wear a medium shoe, I bought the normal size I always wear and these were not tight in fact they keep slipping off my heel. I bought some of the heel things that stick to the back of the shoe and that does not even help. I won't be buying another pair."
3,cute shoes...but...,cute shoes but the left one fell apart after one wear! looks like inferior leather. The shoes were comfortable and the right one was perfect! would buy again but probably go to a store instead of purchasing on line.
5,My favorite huaraches,"This is the second pair of Softspot Trinidad huaraches I have ordered. They are comfortable and go with jeans, skirts or whatever. They are well made, hold up well, and are reasonably priced. Others said they stretch and to order a smaller size but I did not find this to be the case for me. I highly recommend these and will continue to buy them."
5,Comfort from the begining,"I have always loved the huarache look. But normally most of them take awhile to break in to be comfortable.There was no ""break in time"". The first time I wore them I was on my feet all day.I plan to buy a few more pairs soon."
2,Stretched out too much,"These shoes look great but stretched out so much after wearing one time, they are unwearable. I contacted the seller who ignored my inquiry. I wasted my money. Not recommended."
5,Great shoes,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The shoes are comfortable and the neutral color allows me to wear them with almost anything, shorts, skirts, sports, dresses and pants."
4,Nicer than I expected!,"I was a little worried about ordering these shoes, but I had an Amazon credit, so I decided to take a chance. I am between an 8 or an 8 1/2, and between a medium and a wide. I ordered the 8 W in natural. I remember huaraches being very stiff and uncomfortable when I wore them when I was a lot younger. These were a tiny bit stiff for the first hour or so, but after that I had no problems. I have ""bad feet"" and these are helpful because they have that little bit of heel. Like every pair of huaraches I've ever owned, the heel is loose, so if you have very narrow feet I don't think these would work. Overall, though, the fit is fine and the shoes are comfortable and go with just about any summer wardrobe."
1,Slip-on Retro,"Wasted my money on this shoe. The first day my wife wore them they fit perfectly. By the second day, they streched so much she had difficulty keeping them on her feet."
3,Easy to set up but not suitable for high speed USB hard drives,Three stars for the following reasons:1) This hub appears to support only a 12 MBps data rate. This is sufficient for most USB accessories but not for large data transfers to devices like hard drives. It takes me 30 mins to transfer a 1GB file. I was not aware of this limitation until I actually tested it.2) I could not find this part number listed anywhere on Belkin's web site.
1,No firmware or driver updates available for this hub - useless!,"Beware - Belkin's site does not have any documentation, drivers or firmware updates for this hub, so if you have a problem with it, you're on your own. I have one, and after installing a minor operating system upgrade, none of the devices plugged into the hub is recognized by the computer (and each one works just fine when plugged directly into the computer's USB ports). Since there are no updates and no support available from Belkin, it's basically a useless piece of junk now."
5,Bain de Soleil,"My mom bought a copy of this book...about 20 years ago. She got it because it reminded me of a sampler she had made depicting chicks in front of a blazing sun. It was one of my top fives as a kid. When I found it again here, I was beside myself. It arrived speedily, and in perfect shape at that. This virtual thrift shopping is a good substitue for the real thing!"
3,AVERAGE READ,"Clint has shot it out in a barn, has been conked on the noodle and cannot remember just what has happened. Couple of dead bodies decorating the scene, and the newer residents at Rapid want to hang him outright, while a few of the older residents who know him help keep him safe. It's all part of a long trail to save a group of mostly kids who have been kidnapped by 'slavers' to be sold into Canada.Long trail following those wagons, and a long book too, with very little happening. For most Gunsmith readers it will do, but for many others maybe not.Being a 'fan' stuck with it and give it 3 stars. Nothing really exceptional here. Even Robert J. Randisi cannot hit home runs every time.See you soon, amigos. (homage to The Cisco Kid)"
2,Sub par WWII novel,"I really looked forward to reading this book thinking it was on the same level as ""The Caine Mutiny"" or ""The Naked and the Dead"" but I was sorely disappointed. It's simply boring even while there's supposedly a world war going on. What's worse is there's no discernible plot. Another reviewer suggested sticking to Herman Wouk and I agree. His three books: ""The Caine Mutiny"", ""The Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" are about the best WWII novels that I know of."
2,Excessive Military Lingo,"I really did not enjoy this book at all. The product seemed to be the result of an author eager to show everyone that he was well-versed in military language. The story was often disjointed and, due to the use of military lingo without explanation, often incomprehensible.Beyond that, the main story never went anywhere, with strange sub-stories coming out at the end that seemed to have little connection to the main thrust of the first 500 pages. The book is uneven and unenjoyable."
1,Disappointed,"Much as I would have loved to love this book, I'm afraid I didn't. Virtually nothing happens for one thing. There's an interesting incident at the start of the book but it doesn't lead to anything else interesting for the entire rest of the book (i.e., hundreds of pages). I kept waiting for some great courtroom drama to ensue but it never happened. For my money ""The Caine Mutiny"" is still the best novel about WWII that I've read."
4,Good Old Days CD,This is an old school cd that everybody born in the 70's and early 80's should have.
5,NE to the End,"I am now 31 years of age, and I have been a NE fan from the beginning. I think their music still has an impact on the music industry. I believe Candy Girl was their best album. I have been trying to find out whose management they are under. I believe I have a few marketing techniques that would boost their career.It doesn't have to be the end!"
3,You had to be young at the time,"If you were a youngun back in 83, it's likely that you would have loved this. Since R&B harmony groups were rare in 1983 (plus the fact that much of the R&B in those days really stunk), this album was a popular novelty at the time. Listening to it today, it has not stood the test of time well. Their voices had yet to develop into what it would become on songs like ""Can You Stand The Rain."" However, that's not to say that it doesn't have it's moments. While I can't imagine anyone running to the dance floor on ""Candy Girl"" today, ""Popcorn Love,"" & ""Jealous Girl"" still have a kind of cutesy appeal. The rest of it sounds like weak imitation J-5 vocals done to a cheap casio beat. But hey, Michael Jackson himself liked it at the time and it did sound better than a lot of what was out there. But if you were young then and have fond memories of this, go for it."
1,PRODUCT NEVER RECEIVED,I never received this product which was upsetting. I will try to find the cd again from another seller.
4,This is for those,"that dont know NE was and still is (to me) to be one of the best R&B; groups around. Of course this was early on in there career, but even still with songs like Candy Girl, Is This The End and my fav Jealous Girl. Candy Girl only laid the foundation for what would be a group that have many hit albums, songs and tours.If your an NE fan, you should check this out and if your not still check it out. because it is all good no matter who you are."
3,Not exactly new,"I searched long and hard for an interesting retrospective/coffee table book about Lacrosse as a gift for my husband. He has played back in high school, college, and still coaches our children on many teams today. I thought this would be a good choice for him since it included some historical background and some photos/chapters that included some of his lacrosse college contemporaries from the 1990's. This book was a good choice for him. However, at $80 and listed as ""new"", I expected the book to be in better condition. I'm not in the habit of buying anything used online. This book has definitely been sitting around for many years. It looked weathered and had discolored edges and bent corners on the cover jacket. It even had a few sticky stains inside. I paid the higher price of $80 because it was advertised as ""new"". I could have paid less for another copy. ""New"" should mean ""new"", not sticky or yellowed with age. Good book, but disappointing condition for the price."
4,The sexy... new version of 'Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde',"Anthony Perkins, famous for his compelling performances in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" & Ken Russell's ""Crimes Of Passion"" plays the tormented physician (Henry Jekyll) whose dangerous experiments unleash his ... other side, the out of control Jack Hyde.Perkins is perfect in his dual role. The movie is an explosion of nightmarish killings and perverted sex!"
5,Very Cool,"I do think that the other reviewers of this movie are prudes. This is my favorite Anthony Perkins film, it is also his bisexual 'coming out' film. Its treatment of the medical uses of cocaine is historically accurate. Its blending of Jack the Ripper and Jekyl & Hyde is well done. Perhaps it is the irreverence and nontraditional philisophical digressions that trouble the other reviewers so. Overall an excellent film, unless you're a suburbanite with spouse, 2.3 kids, and a dog and you can't handle a look into the dark depths of the human soul."
2,Perkins in good form. Pity he's wasted in this mess.,"Anthony Perkins plays Dr Jekyl in a film very thinly based on the famous story. Experimenting with drugs which bring out animals' more unpleasant characteristics he accidentally inhales the vapour of said drugs knocked over by a monkey in his lab (a scene 'borrowed' from Monkey Shines?) He then turns into what seems to be some distant relative of Barbara Cartland and, before you can say Hyde, he is roaming the streets as Jack the Ripper.Though Perkins is in fine form, it has to be said that this film seems to be no more than an excuse for one example of sexual depravity after another. The constant sexual scenes before long demonstrate a complete lack of ideas on the part of the script-writers and the 'surprise' ending is just laughable. There is the occasional briefer-than-brief appearance of one or two characters from the Jekyl and Hyde novel, but they certainly can't save this film from being anything but a bore."
3,Gothic Sleaze...,"Dr. Jekyll (Anthony Perkins from THE TRIAL, PSYCHO 1-4, PRETTY POISON) is working on a new anesthetic in his lab, when his test monkey accidentally mixes the wrong chemicals together. Uh-oh! The fumes from the mixture cause Jekyll to transform into the hideous Mr. ""Jack"" Hyde! This culminates in much debauchery through nightly visits to the bad side of town. Of course, Hyde is a sadistic, twisted serial killer (yep, THAT Jack) w/ a vendetta against prostitutes, so we are quickly taken into the gutters and back alleys, as well as a rather groovy brothel. Perkins gets to ham it up royally, see-sawing wildly between quiet, reserved doctor and gonzo-murderer! Anyone else might seem ridiculous, but Perkins is in familiar territory here! Loaded w/ nudity, blood, and semi-psychedelic lighting, EDGE OF SANITY is a wacked-out hoot!..."
2,If the porn was removed this film would be 5 minutes long.,"Anthony Perkins of 'Psycho' fame plays a limping doctor who turns into the black-clad Jack the Ripper as a result of a monkey knocking over a chemical in his lab which brings out the unpleasant characteristics in people and animals alike. Whilst Perkins is good in his role and provides one or two memorable moments, this film is mainly nothing more than wall-to-wall filth, pornography and depravity from start to finish. And you can't help feeling that the Jekyl & Hyde title was just tacked on to help the film sell. This really doesn't have very much to do with the famous story, the film being little more than an excuse to show endless sleaze and rather cliched Victorian characters. What a waste of time."
3,"Good review about the basic,Great illustrations and pictures","This book makes a excellent review about the most important skills you need to know. The best part for me is the airway managent skills cause is easy to understand and have good pictures, also important is the part about the management of head trauma conforms to the brain trauma fundation.The problem is that it dont talk about pharmacology and cardiac management. This book have great ilustrations and images with full collor. Good idea If you live out of the USA or if this is your first experience buying Paramedic books by the net. AYAX SOBRINO SAAVEDRA"
5,one of the all time funniest books I have ever read.,"It so apropos today. Bruce Gold has a job at the White House... to make sure the politicians say absolutely nothing of any importance at all, but sound like they are. This book is biting. Hilarious. I have read all his books and oddly enough while I loved Catch-22, and Something Happened, this one sticks with me. It is all about the Orwellian newspeak which I seem to hear everywhere these days. But done with a wicked sense of humour. Laugh out loud funny. The best political satire I have ever read."
2,Jewish in America?,"If being being Jewish in American means being immature, spiteful, and rude to your family, that doesn't make this book any less obnoxious. If it means having a big ego while feeling unappreciated by every human on the planet for your brilliance, it still isn't particularly readable. I don't know what it means to be Jewish in America, but I sincerely hope that this isn't it.Satire is funny because it is relevant and potentially very true. We laugh when the protagonist's car is totaled only to have a building fall on the brand new one the day he gets it. ""That's not covered by your insurance, sir."" We laugh, because it's sadly true.How is this garbage relevant to my life?"
1,What's on the CD?,Where do I click to see what songs are on the album? Not buying this one without knowing what's on it.
4,How old will Superman be?,"Not the original Superman...but DC readers get the drift (I guess).At any rate, the storyline seemed a bit convoluted, however did not detract from the enjoyment of the story. JLA One Million had everything, betrayal, a juggernaut baddie, and the plot twists that we enjoy in superhero adventures.(Plausible spoiler hint); BIG GL fan here (particularly Kyle Raynor, who I can relate to), so this book appealed to me when reading it."
2,"Short sequences, not a full story","We had hoped for another ""full"" Barnyard story, but what we received is like short sequences comparable with a few TV series... For that it was a little disappointing."
5,Fun For the Younger Children,This DVD is a great one to have for younger children especially from age 3-6 years old. The animals take on human characteristics and behaviors as they go about doing their fun and sometimes silly activities as they try to avoid letting the farmer and his nosey neighbors discover what they are up to. The humor is such that young children can understand it and let's face it children at a young age love silly things especially talking barnyard animals. One of the great things about this DVD that is about 90 minutes long is that it is divided up into episodes that are about 10-12 minutes long each so its great to use with young children as a reward or short entertainment. Don't be surprised if the adults in your home sneak a peek at what all these amusing and unconventional barnyard animals are up to in their carefree capers on the farm when no one is supposedly looking. Great fun!
2,"BEWARE, lots of mono tracks!","For whatever reason ""Everything Is Beautiful"" contains many mono tracks that were in stereo on the original vinyl issue. Very disappointing. Another hack job from Collectables. I'll stick with my scratchy old stereo record."
4,Fun!,The story is rather silly (psychologists will be wincing) but it's a lot of fun. The songs are enjoyable and the dancing is amazing!
1,Blu-ray disk did not work,"Purchased blu-ray version and after inserting the disk in the player, a standard blu-ray info type screen came up but it wouldn't proceed to the next chapter/movie root menu. Even skipping chapters or forwarding did not help. Tried on a couple of players (PS3 40GB and BDP-S360) with same results.update: Jun 14 2010. I purchased this movie in blu-ray one more time and to my dismay, the same thing happened again... the movie would not play nor will it come to the main/root menu. After some researching I found that apparently there is a compatibility problem this disk has with at least the 2 Sony players mentioned above. The workaround is to click on the Options button (the triangle shaped icon on the remote), select 'Go To' and then go and change the Chapter from 1 to 5 and click on the OK button. It will work! The picture quality isn't the sharpest but its still better than DVD quality."
3,LOUD with not much top end!,"This mic works well for what it costs. I find that it has a very high output when compared to the signal from other, wired mics, I use. Overall, it's great for passing around to sing, to announcements etc, but I'm not sure that I would choose it as a prime mic for our band. The range it puts out is very heavy on the bottom end leaving the top missing. You can compensate a bit with a decent EQ, but it's still not perfect. If I had a few hundred more bucks, I'd have bought something a step or two up, but I didn't. If you don't have a few hundred more bucks, this is a great way to go!"
3,"nice wireless shure mic, BUT ....","the product itself is very good, reception-wise, sound quality and clarity, ease of use, available options (signal switching) but why I only gave it 3 stars is because of the following: (1)Disconnecting the 9 volt battery from the terminal was quite a hassle, it was so tight I was afraid the mic's battery terminal would come off (2) for the price of $300, the SHURE company could have provided a small plastic portable case. without any extra cost.That way, the mic and receiver would be protected on transport.""We need to protect what is precious"", I hope the manufacturer would try to see beyond just that of a good quality product."
2,pro dj,"I took this mic on one job and promptly returned it the next day (not purchased on Amazon). Basically it did not sound good and had way too much feedback. It may be alright for some light use, but if you are a true professional this product is not for you. I could tell from the moment I opened the box, neither the mic nor the receiver had any weight to them. You can tell it is a cheapy. On the tough and lonely road, it will not be there for you, it will not be your friend. GO STEELERS!!"
1,Very disappointing,"I had loved the book ""The Twelve"" by William Gladstone, so I thought that his movie ""Tapping the source"" would be as inspiring and uplifting, but it is not ! First, the music is so loud that it is sometimes very difficult to hear what the persons say (especially if English is not your mother tongue or if you have hearing difficulties), and second, the interviews are too short, too fast and very shallow... No time to ponder and integrate their messages.Conversely to ""The Secret"", the names are not indicated, which is very frustrating, as either you try to recognize the famous ones (and you don't focus on what they say) or you just wonder who are the others. There is a kind of directory on the DVD (separate from the movie) but again it goes very fast and just gives the website of the speakers.I totally agree with Ronald : it's a bunch of clips just thrown together with no real direction. I regret my purchase."
3,Entertaining,This is an entertaining episode that is completely fictional. It reminds me of the movie mimic and aliens. I found it funny that there were only three workers in the hospital.
4,great show,"I enjoy watching this show on Animal Planet when it is on. It is somewhat done in the Blair Witch style, and it kind of shows you the legend of the creature being shown. Hopefully they continue making more seasons of this show. If you are interested in Cryptology you will find this show interesting."
2,Just don't bother,"Like I said don't bother watching this show at all because the acting is so bad. The only couple good episodes are the Beast of Monteray, Dover Demon, Vampires, and the giant centipede one. Overall still bad but those I think are the best ones."
5,Quiltmaker is Wonderful,"In my opinion Quiltmaker is a magazine I won't ever be without. If I could only have one quilt magazine subscription, it would be Quiltmaker. I love it and would recommend it to every quilt maker."
5,One of the best magazine for active quilters and those that just like to browse,This is a wonderful magazine. I have always found it to be up to date with new ideas in patterns and methods.Wonderful explicit magazine and it is a fun magazine.
3,Stone Mt. Urban Mini Purse,"Though the size of the purse is just what I wanted and I have purchased Stone Mt. purses in the past, the quality of the leather wasn't as soft and supple as purses I have purchased in the past."
3,Kamu's readings bring down Karajan's,"I agree with the other reviewers that Karajan, a stellar Sibelius conductor, is the star of this budget 3-disc set. Okko Kamu gets the same huge sonority from the Berlin Phil., and his Second Sym. is certainly worthy, but in the First and Third with the Helsinki orchestra he lacks intensity and insight.Actually, if you want a nearly complete cycle from Karajan, his versions of Sym. 1 and 2 are available on EMI with the Berlin Phil., which can be added to his various recordings (amounting to two or three each) of Sym. 4, 5, 6, and 7. As to whether the DG or the EMI versions are better, I will leave that to personal taste. To my ears, all of Karajan's Sibelius ranks at the very top. He neglected only Sym. #3, for reasons I've never seen discussed, but in this regard he joins quite a few notable Sibelians who apparently don't like this work."
3,Good but less than expected,"The CDs are ""made in Germany"" and I had high expectations of the recording quality. It was ok only and that was a little bit of disappointment."
1,Worst keyboard I ever used.,"Even cheaper ones worked better. Unless keys are pressed dead center they jam and need significant pressure. Especially a problem for CTRL, SHIFT, ALT, etc."
1,Worst keyboard ever,"I bought one of these at a local retail store. The keys scrape against the casing as you press them, so you have to press harder which strains the fingers and wrists. The enter key is especially difficult, as I have to jam my pinky finger down real hard in the center of the key.A lot of keyboards have issues with detecting multiple keys being held at the same time. But this is the only keyboard I've ever seen that can't detect more than one arrow key being held at the same time, making some games unplayable. No diagonal scrolling in Starcraft, for example. I found a workaround, though: turn off numlock and diagonals will work. Better yet, just throw away this garbage.Quite possibly the worst Belkin product, and that's saying something!"
2,Very Dissappointing,"After having waited over a month to receive this video I was so dissappointed in the type of words they chose to teach which were mostly animals, the quality of the video was poorly done, very choppy demonstrations which gave me a headache after I was done watching and the plain fact that I did not learn the alphabet which I would think is the first thing a beginner should learn. I guess I will have to take the class in college after all."
1,It was very different from what I expected......,"I did not like it at all. It was not for beginners. I was expecting to learn sign language alphabet and basic stuff of sign language, but I did not see any of those stuff. You will not be able to learn sign language from this video if you are a beginner. Quality of video was very poor as well. It was very amature work."
3,"Lots of words, no sentences.","This tape offers a list of words, lots of animals, river, and other nouns. The words are shown signed, written in English and illustrated by real life photos. It is meant to be of interest to children and my not quite three year old grand daughter watched it and signed along. What it fails to show is the way deaf people interact using American Sign Language. For people already familiar with American Sign Language this video would help to build vocabulary. It does nothing to impart syntax or sentence structure. It would be greatly improved for my purposes if two people had presented in dialogue form: e.g. Where are you going? I'm going to the river. What is that animal called? It is a lion. And so forth. With what I learned I can now sign a word list, which is not useful skill for me."
3,A good video but not for beginners,"I was disappointed in this video for two reasons. First, the vocabulary selection is inappropriate for beginners. Among the first words signed 25 (nearly 25% of the total) are for animals and other wild creatures, which a beginner is unlikely to need or use. What the beginner needs are signs for such basic ideas as ""hello,"" ""goodbye,"" ""thank you,"" ""excuse me,"" ""please,"" ""yes,"" and ""no,"" none of which are demonstrated. Second, the movements are too fast. The beginner needs to see movements close up and in slow motion to be sure he or she knows exactly which fingers should be used, and exactly how the movements should be executed. A person who already knows the basics of signing, however, will undoubtedly find some value in this video."
5,Correction,"The quote in the first review should be ""Post proof ... "" and not ""Post proves."" Makes sense that way."
3,A classic of American sincerity and awkward decency.,"I read this book over 25 years ago and have not picked it up since, --- even although it still sits on my shelves -- and yet I can write a review on it. -- It must have something to have become such a part of my mind. I suppose there is first the pleasure of seeing a young Eric Sevareid; the boy behind the wise old television commentator. But mostly it is the pleasure of seeing the world of the late 1930's and the early 1940's through the eyes of a young man desperately trying to be honest. It was mainly supposed to be about WWII but if you look closely, there's famous American phonies, a little shame for his country's racism and just a little awkward homophobia. I recommend it for the serious reader."
5,Great condition,"What I find most frustrating in buying books since I like first editions is that many of the booksellers here at Amazon skip the details and instead tell you how many books they ship. I don't care if they will take it back, too much of a hassle so I take a pass on those without a decent description. I think Amazon should have some listing standards.This book was well described and a joy to receive, haven't had a chance to read it yet but a great addition to my collection."
1,2007 Honda Accord,I have a 2007 Honda Accord and ordered this to install an aftermarket stereo below the existing climate control/radio. When the stock connector is disconnected from the climate control/radio unit there isn't much space to add the Scosche connector. The lead wires between the connectors simply isn't long enough to connect between the stock climate control/radio and the detached connection. Had to modify this to extend the lead wires between connectors but this really wasn't easy considering there is so little wire between the connectors to work with. There is a comparable part from American International that appears to have longer lead wires between connectors. I haven't gotten my hands on it so I can't verify for sure that is the case.
4,"I had read it before, and forgot...","I had read this once before and forgot, which tells you something about the story. Not Kig at his yes, but as always, not bad either.One of his thinnest plots as you know from early one what the general outcome is going to be.Good cottage reading."
4,Good book,"i think needful things is a good book with an original plot. the only problem is that it's too long : to tell the whole story, 450 pages would have been the perfect number for a book like this.Anyway buy it and you won't be disappointed.SK RULES!"
3,Needful Editing,"Classic Stephen King. I'm surprised I hadn't picked it up before, since I've read nearly everything King has written. . It reads like it should be connected with the Dark Tower series, but if it is, then it's very slight.I would give it four stars, but whoever did the editing for the Kindle edition needs to be dealt with."
2,problem with this novel,"I had a real problem with this novel. Actually, it was the last Stephen King novel I read. I had read most of his novels until that point. But while reading ""Needful Things"" I realized that I had read it before. I realized that this great American writer, whom I adored, had run out of things to write about."
4,As Great Suspense As Ever!,"Once again, a bone-chilling, charmingly hideous piece of action from the one and only King of horror fiction. ""Needful Thing"" is the sixth book by him I've read, and my admiration for Stephen King only increases. This is not as good as ""The Stand"" or ""Pet Sematary"", but it's still one of the best suspense novels, horror if you will, that I've read so far in my life."
3,Salem's Lot without the Vampires,"This is not a bad Stephen King novel. The problem is that it does not really have any monsters per se, and is more about people and how their desire to ""have"" and ""want"" something can spell their doom. It is a good book by all means read it, but you just can't help feeling that by the end maybe reading something else better from King while watching ""Wishmaster 2"" should have been the way to go."
3,Secrets,"This book taught: We should never keep secrets, People are easy to turn against each other, Knowing your neighbor is an important part of a community, and more."
2,Too Much,"I have been through a string of King's books and have enjoyed them a lot. Needless Things, however, was too disturbing to finish. wanted to see Leland Gaunt get in the end, but didn't make it. perhaps King did too good of a job on this.. Still want to explore other King books. He's an extremely good author. I'll leave this one alone. Donald"
3,Implausible and not among Kiing's best,"I disagree with most of the reviewers of this title on a number of counts. First, I consider that King's later novels, in general, are better than his early ones. Bag of Bones and Cell are brilliant. Second, having made that point, I consider Needful Things to be one of King's weaker later novels. Leland Gaunt just doesn't work very well as a villain--his motivations are unclear and his characterization is inconsistent.One more point: The relationship between Polly and Sheriff Pangborn, which is central to the novel, never really rises above the level of bathos. I'll give this three stars--the writing style IS very strong.Wish I could say the same for the plot."
5,Lavishingly Excellent,A most intriguing and terrifying journey into the darkest depths of the human heart. Such a good read.
3,Terrible typos!!,"Good story in the early Stephen King style but the typos, bad punctuation and bad spelling were hard to forgive. Kindle, PLEASE proofread the books better!!"
1,Boring,My first and last attempt to read a Stephen King book. It is one of the most boring books I have ever read.
5,One of his best,"This book is NOT his best, but ONE of his best. I was completely enthralled with the concept of a guy visiting a small town and turning the people of that town against each other. wow. It could have been a bit shorter, but that Stephen King's vice. We have to deal with it.--review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow."
3,Great at the beginning but...,"That's right. I've read some of Stephen's books but surely this wasn't the best. It starts like you can't leave the book for a second, but when it comes near to the end it becomes more like you force yourself to finish it. It has too much fantacy, something I don't like. I prefer horror stories more connected to true life, that you'd think maybe that could really happen in some place of the world, but this one, not a tiny chance."
2,"A decent read, but a bit weak","I've always liked Stephen King's books, but this one didn't quite do it for me. The story premise was interesting, but I just didn't get into the heads of most of the characters. Those I did identify with in most cases didn't survive to the end of the book. King does evoke a strong sense of setting, and Castle Rock is definitely a town I'll be happy to visit in other books. Since it's the last of the Castle Rock books, and not very strong, I wouldn't recommend it as a good place to start when reading King's books."
5,Needful Things.....,"is a great SK novel. The charatchers are interesting and what also makes it more interesting is the storekeeper is how he uses the people of Castle Rock turn on each other.This novel is one of SK's best, and truly this is a must have for hard core SK fans like myself.This ranks with the big boys like 'The Stand' 'IT' 'The Tommyknockers' 'Insomia' 'Carrie' 'Salems Lot' 'The Shining' and my list goes on.If you want to be scared and looking for a good suspense novel, then this is it."
3,Too many spelling errors,The plot is very good. I love Stephen King. The kindle version has a lot of spelling errors that were very distracting.
2,Below average for SK,"Over ten years ago I picked this hardcover up in a bargain bin. I started it but laid it down and didn't return to it until just recently. Now I remember why I laid it down. Long and boring. This book would have made a wonderful short story. SK was really stretching things by making an epic novel out of it. His editor was asleep at the wheel, it seems.Skip it. There's a reason this novel rarely (if ever) appears on the ""favorites"" lists of SK fans."
4,Goodbye Castle Rock,"This is a wonderful book. When the Devil (AKA Leland Gaunt) opens his Needful Things shop in town, there is something for everyone if they are willing to pay the price (mainly there soul).What kind of things praytell. Well for 11 year old Brian its a baseball card, for Polly a necklace that soothes her arthritus for Ace it's a fast car.Strange, shortly after the shop opens, towns people who have known each other for years are starting to kill one another. Why? That's what Sheriff Panghorn wants to know.One thing for sure. This is a wonderfully well constructed and entertaining novel. It has minimal blood and gore like in other horror novels, including those by Mr. King; however, you won't be disappointed."
2,Good except for the worst ending in all of Stephen King,"That was the worst ending I've ever read from Stephen King. And I've read CELL.We have a story full of lots of characters -- too many to keep straight -- and the wonderful horror that sweeps over their town. Good work.Then we have the ending. Out of left field, we get all these extra ""facts"" that weren't introduced at all, just silly deus ex devices to fake us into feeling some symmetry when our hero and villain face off.SO CONTRIVED! UGH!Was very disappointed in the ending of this novel and would not recommend it.Also, very strong sexual content, not really appropriate for anyone under whatever age you think is old enough to learn about how lewd people can be."
2,READS LIKE A BAD SOAP OPERA. NOT A WORTHY KING PRODUCT!!,"Well, let's just say this is not one of Stephen King's greatest hits!! I certainly like the premise but I think a Novella would have been enough compared to this overly wordy behemoth. I am a Stephen King fan from the first release of ""Carrie""...a book I read and reread so much I had to buy a second copy! ""Needful Things"" would be a great Television Series..sort of in the manner of ""Friday, the Thirteenth."" Many other presentations from King are much much better. If you are a Stephen King fan, you must read this story, just to finish ""The Castle Rock"" series of titles. But again, this is not top-notch King writing from the king of horror."
3,Normal but imaginative to a little extent,"Well I don't see what all this hype about Stephen King is. The man is a fool especially with Dreamcatcher. His books are poor, the language is profane and it isn't that interesting if at all. And what is this sick attraction he has with Dracula? I mean I love that book too and it is possibly one of the best gothic novels ever written but for somebody like king to steal a phrase (the end of chapter 1 of needful things) ""enter freely and leave some of the happiness you bring"" Anne rice and all other horror wanna-be's are lame. All the old horror masters are gone now, so people must contend with mediocre, retarded and very secular novels. Well they haven't read mine, and never will."
1,Stephen King Rips Off Richard Matheson Yet Again,"The idea for this story came several years earlier, in an excellent, far-superior short story called ""The Distributor"" by the true horror master: Richard Matheson. King has made a career of stealing ideas from Matheson. He just took The Distributor and made it longer, but took out it's life and imagination. There's one good scene, but it doesn't justify reading the whole book. Read ""The Distributor"" and get the story better and faster. Blecch!"
1,Stephen King has no idea on how to write books.2 thumbs down,This book had no firm basis or anything to keep it called a book. It didn't have a 1) begginnig2) middle or 3) end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!For shame.....
4,King's near masterpiece,"This is King writing near top form,as Fangoria's W.C. Stroby put it. It is an intelligently written big book, throwing dozens of tiny sub-plots here and there and tying them all up neatly. I was a bit fearful that the conclusion wouldn't amount to so much..and I was right. That was what made the book, an otherwise great read, into one of the most unfortunate let-downs of King's."
4,Way to go Mr. King; this one is well worth the effort.,"A very enjoyable read with good character development (and there are lots of them!), plot flow and suspense. You'll be eager to turn the pages as each strand of a rather complex web is spun and set in place. Then watch the whole thing become unraveled as the dominoes fall and trace out an intricate design. Take the time to read this one. If you like a tale that twangs your chill generator, you won't be disappointed."
4,the devil made them do it.,this is the LAST Castle Rock book. Mr. King brings the Devil himself to Derry and things get strange (as if you thought his book would be otherwise) the residents get tempted by things they want and will do ANYTHING to get them.
2,Not one of his best.,"I had to make my self read to the middle of the book and then I lost interest. I still pick it up every now and then because I hate leaving things incomplete, but this one is so poorly written that I can't stick with it. Even the movie was a disappointment."
2,2 stars...on the KING scale,"This book may be better than just 2 stars...but the problem is how do you give it more than that, when books like Salem's Lot, The Shinning, Pet Semetary can only get 5? I have been reading King's books for 15 years...and this one didnt do it for me. I liked the story line building around people's paranoia and insecurities...but in the end, the book fell short."
4,A horror for need,"I just got finished read a book, and I realized what is SK's horror. Someday I will read every book of SK. Because his story is grotesque and plot is fast and discription is cruel.The whole situation was weird...and getting weirder all the time. As time went by Needful Thing is a poison place, and Mr. Gaunt is a poison man. Only he's really not a man.-Who is HE? Maybe devil."
4,Ever think of what YOU need?,"As one of King's so-called 'Constant Readers', this book of his has always stood out to me. Not in the last place because it's movie actually did the book credit (in my opinion third in-line after the prison tales The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile)The basic idea was the most gripping to me. What if there is a store, where you could get the one thing you need most? And it can be anything from a baseball-card, Elvis' glasses to a money-winning horserace game....And for the final trick, you just have to 'perform a little prank' in return. And before you know it you lit a fuse and an entire village is at war, including the local father and vicar.Brilliant. Read it and get swept away by King's version of selling your soul to the devil. Beautifully played by Max von Sydow in the movie. Ancient, likeable, gentlemanlike, seemingly concerned, but through and through evil.Excellent story telling."
5,best king ive read,"Needful Things is a very well written suspensful novel with twists and turns. The suicide the things the shopkeeper does for his ""repayment"" seem not to be horrible, but just a vandilism or a rumor but they turn deadly turning people against each other ruining the town until the point where something has to be done. NO SPOILERS WILL I EVER WRITE!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nothing like Stephen King for a bedtime story,"I have read a number of books by Stephen King, and I think that this one has a very good idea. However, the realization is somewhat faulty. The book changes rhythm once too often, and some parts are getting a little bit boring, and you have the urge to skip some pages to get to the important part of the story. In conclusion, I think that any reader should take this book with moderate expectations and he will not be disappointed."
2,Temptations Ltd.,"To put it bluntly, this is one of Stephen King's worst novels. As a big admirer of King, my major criticism has always been that he has a poor ""end game"". His ability to create and make you envision people and whole communities as if they were real, is second to none. However come the end of a story, he doesn't seem to know how to finish in a way that would do his stories justice... And for me, Needful Things is by far the worst example. Annie Wilkes would not be pleased!On a final note, this story is obviously influenced by an old Peter Cushing movie called Temptations Ltd, made in 1973, which is about an antique dealer with supernatural powers..."
1,"A wonderful book, but.....","The one star is to attract atttention. I actually thought this book was original in prose and content until...I read 'Need', a short story in a book called Beyond, author Theodore Sturgeon circa 1960. The plot and idea of this book, while excellent, as well as the outstanding prose of King combine to make this a Five-Star book. Nonetheless, the credit for this story goes to Sturgeon. For those of you who don't know, Sturgeon was an outstanding SF writer of the 50's and 60's who Stephen King obviously read. If you like King, you'll love Sturgeon who can do the same thing in thirty-five pages that King takes five-hundred for. And if you think King can write, well let me tell you, you'd better read Sturgeon!"
5,Simply the best,"I've been a King reader for almost 8 years, and have read many of the old stuff. They are great, really horror... but this one is simply the best. The characters, the plot, the idea, the writting... everything is great. The idea of the devil gathering followers with little favors is genious. I recommend this book for everybody that wants to feel (and be scary of) the real Stephen King."
5,An amazing book!,This is a kind of a book only Stephen King can write.The story is great and the characters are so well described that I could actualy see every one of them in my mind. This book is a fiction but I found myself thinking what would I do if I were in the same position as the people from Castle Rock. I certanly reccomend it.
5,This is a great book,I thought that Stephen King put alot of work into this novel and that it was one of his best. He is a relly great autho
4,Interesting,"Still takes a while to get into the plot, once the story begins it isn't all that bad.Thought the actors didn't do their best job in this movie."
3,Kitsch by name kitsch by accent,"Liked the book. The movie was a bit dumbed down but genrally OK. Good production values etc. Good extras too. Taylor Kitsch's accent runied it for me though. It went here, there everywhere, North America, Europe, curius melanges, african inflections. Truly bad. Truly distracting and annoying. In fairness his acting was fine.Memo to casting agents. NEVER LET THIS GUY DO A ROlE WHERE HE NEEDS A FOREIGN ACCENT AGAIN!!! Dub him if you have to. Other North American actors in the movie did OK with this aspect."
3,"True, but sad story","Loved the book, liked the movie. This true story of photojournalists facing danger is fascinating, but the price they paid was high."
3,Uneven but interesting,"The best scenes were the photographers doing what they do best, the worst scenes were the ones with the girlfriends, as everyone tries to balance the harshness of their jobs with romance in their personal lives. And oh, btw, you will need a high tolerance for rough language, the F bomb gets dropped alot.Best scene was the one where Kevin Carter is forced to justify taking the famous vulture picture and not helping the girl in the picture. His pain and anger show clearly and the conflict between documenting an event and influencing it is clearly illustrated in that scene.Worst scene: where one of the photographers girlfriends can't help him document a tragic event. She's supposed to be a picture editor for crying out loud! Annoying, I thought."
2,Couldn't even finish due to camera shake,"The irony of a movie about photography, directed by someone who's apparently never heard of a TRIPOD! There's way too much of this idiotic trend in film making of this intentional hand held ""effect"" by continually moving the camera around, up and down, zoom in-out, shake, shake shake. It's sad to see this tawdry television fad finding its way into big screen movies. I would have really liked to see this film but I couldn't even finish the movie. It gave me a headache. Too bad, I suspect it had subject content that I would have found to be very interesting. I certainly hope this camera shake fad doesn't go much further. It's ruining a number of otherwise tolerable and some rather good scripts."
2,Good Historical,"Not exactly what I was expecting. And although they did mention ""BangBang Club"" in the movie it does not tie it in well. If you can rent it instead of buying, that would probably be a good idea. Not a good representation of Taylor Kitsch's potential. He has done much, much better."
4,"FastCap Glu-Bottle, 16oz.","I am giving this 4 stars, because I use a lot of glue. This system allows you to spread glue in very small amounts. This prevents additional cleaning of the glue from the wood. However, the nasal will clog on you if you do not clean after each use. Recommend using a small pin. Hope this helps."
2,It's OK,"Thought I'd love this because I do a lot of woodworking, mostly cabinet making. But the red cap doesn't seal out air as well as a regular glue bottle, and your product will begin too dry out.It dispenses well, maybe I don't do enough woodworking or go through enough glue.Ended up throughing it out and am sticking with the factory bottles."
5,GREATLY INSPIRATIONAL AND UPRISING TO ONE'S SPIRIT,"I'M 14 YEARS OLD AND BEEN READING MS.ANGELOU'S BOOKS SINCE I WAS 10. TO ME HER BOOKS ARE THE ONLY REASON WHY I STILL GO ON. SHE INSPIRED ME TO WRITE POETRY AND COME OUT WITH THE TRUTH EVEN THOUGH IT WILL HURT MANY PEOPLE.MS. ANGELOU IS LIKE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL THAT THE LORD HAVE SENT DOWN TO WATCH OVER ME. WITH OUT HER WONDERFUL WORDS WHICH I RELATE TO I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR I'D BE TODAY. SO LIKE MAYA I'M KEEPING MY HEAD UP. REMEMBERING ALWAYS THAT SOMETIMES I'M GONNA FALL BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS I HAVE TO GET BACK UP.SO IN HER WORDS ""I RISE""."
2,Not crazy about fragrance!,"Product arrived in a timely fashion and is lovely in it's presentation . The fragrance is OK but not what I would call a favorite. Gave to a friend who likes it a lot more than I do. Boudoir has an old-fashioned, cloying type of scent. This is not a WOW fragrance! I was looking for a subtle yet elegant fragrance like Allure by Chanel or an even sweeter more heady fragrance like Organza by Givenchy. These I recommend highly. Sorry, Boudoir was just not to MY liking. I would not use even if I received it as a gift."
4,Good basic information,This book was used by my plant propagation teacher while I was at the university. It explains the basic principles of plant propagation in detail. All the information is back-up by scientific data. Very good for the professional grower or a plant science student; not very appropriate for the common gardener.
5,Fun and exciting book!,I read this to my third grade class and it really helps their critical thinking skills. The stories are so fun and sometimes I am stumped!
2,More Stories to Solve,"I am always looking for reading material for me and the kids at night, and mine have reached that tweener age where it is difficult.These mysteries held their interest because I made it interactive, but it was a little hard for them to relate to the settings.My biggest complaint , however, is that it is very short making it a poor value. There are only 15 stories each one runs only a few pages"
3,Decent enough.,"Though his story telling is nowhere near as compelling Neil Gaiman, Mike Carey does a decent enough job. The series would only get better as it progresses."
5,Lucifer after Sandman,"Mike Carey brings back Lucifer from the Sandman series for his own storyline complete with uncooperative angels, a girl who sees her best friend's ghost, a teen unsure of a unusual roadtrip with Morning Star and a tarot deck gone postal. Can't wait to read more!"
4,Hell of a start,"If you like your literature dark, lurid and intense, feel free to indulge in Lucifer. The mere concept is rewarding to think about but seeing the personification of the prince of darkness as he goes about his day is as gratifying as it can get. Cool and cruel best describes Lucifer but he's mainly just trying to enjoy life since he got fed up with his dayjob so to speak. If you've read and loved Sandman, Preacher, or Kid Eternity, you're going to love Lucifer. Get ready for one hell of a ride."
2,Good book. Bad packaging. Worse service.,It took ages to arrive. The series is amazing but the service was not....It was bent to hell when it arrived. It's very unsatisfactory.....
4,Pretty good,"""I admit, I'm not well versed in Gaiman's work."" Boy, that's true, since Neil Gaiman didn't write this.! You seem to be unable to grasp the obvious. As for the comic, it's above average but not fantastic. The artwork is great but the story is only average. Still, it's a very promising idea and can't wait to see what is don with it in future installments."
4,Giving the devil his due!,"Mike Carey had the daring task of following Neil Gaiman's portrayal of Lucifer (from the Sandman series)and he has passed the test with flying colors! Carey's Lucifer,IMHO,actually surpasses Gaiman's and that is a very difficult thing to do. Even though he is devious and shrewd, you can't help but like the guy! This book contains the three issue ""The Morningstar Option"" from Sandman Presents and the first four issues of the regular series which has been nominated for five Eisners. Read this book and give the devil his due!"
1,Cheaply made,"This pop filter is very cheaply made. The clamp that is at the ""bottom"" of the plastic ring which allows it to be mounted to the bendable arm fell off after just a few uses. I currently have just the pop filter rubber-banded to my mic. Looking for one that is better made.Avoid..."
3,CAD EPF-15A 6-Inch Flexible Pop Filter,"It's just OK. The gooseneck is very weak, but it still holds up the filter as long as you don't bump it. It's light, but it still works."
4,It works...I'm happy...,"I like to buy on the low end if the functionality of the product makes it possible ""get by"" with it rather than spend much more money and not achieve equal add on benefit. This product falls in that category. It works and it was very inexpensive! I have no complaints."
5,Excellent Buy!,"Couldn't recommend this Pop Filter more. I'm a recording engineer by trade and have use many Pop Filters that cost much more with less quality. This one is used for my podcasting studio - affixed to a desktop mic stand. It holds position perfectly, as well as remaining clamped tightly to the stand. This is the best value for a pop filter that i have found. Get it. Treat it nicely, and it will serve you well."
5,Works great,"This product works just as it should, I even tried to force popping to occur in my recording and had to try pretty hard. I also use a table top mic stand but had little trouble attaching and positioning the screen properly. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to prevent audio pops from occurring"
4,great pop filter,this filter is a good size that covers almost any style mic well. prevents those clicks and pops well. minimizes but does not get rid of slight inhales all together.
4,Still use it now!!!!!!,"i probably bought this product with amazon like three years ago and i still have it on my mic stand and use it everytime i record music, if anything would recommend you take care of it since the spit protector is very thin like pantty whose wise but still a great buy for better sound production to cut most of the pahhh sounds when recording...."
2,"CAD continues to make poor products, even with smaller items","CAD is universally known, at least in my circles, as super low quality cheap stuff. From the mics to instruments to accessories. I thought maybe, this pop screen would be difference, since it's pretty basic. But nope, CAD continues it's flaws.The packaging of this thing was just plain horrible, it was so folded it up, I was afraid to even open it for fear it was already broken. Maybe that means it was a used item?? I dunno.After one day of use, and attaching it to a vocal mic stand, the pop screen fell off. The screw was tightened really good, and should have held it, but it just came out. I got it to stay on, but any sudden movements, or a light breeze from the air condition, and this thing is coming off.Not worth paying the shipping to return it, and will not buy any CAD items ever again"
5,Good Basic Pop Filter,Does just what is needed - at a good price. A must for every studio. Was exactly what I was hoping for.
5,Fabulous.,"You can only use a coat-hanger and nylons for so long before you make your cheap self get a real pop screen. This works great. I use it in conjunction with an orange clamp attached to the base, so it can sit on a desktop. Works great, and the price was better than anything I found online or at a store."
4,"It does it's job, what more to say?","It's just a simple pop filter. It works great, filters out pops, and it also catches my saliva. I don't want my mic to get ruined :)"
3,Might find a better one.,The screw/knob that tightens the gooseneck to the arm always comes undone very easily. I think they could have designed one that tightens better. Other than that this is a good pop screen to get going with.
3,Hardware could be better,"This is a good product. my only problem is that the bracket that's intended to connect it to a mic stand is not very substantial. I find myself frequently tightening it. Otherwise, this was a good purchase."
3,"Cheap, surprisingly sturdy.","You may wat to reconsider buying ANY filter.On this model, the top (filter) part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tube.Despite this, the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good.In all honesty, Buy a nicer filter, or none at all. They do NOT make a huge difference on recording quality unless you're using Top-of-the-line microphones. If this is the case, spend the money to get a nicer filter.One nice thing- these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them. I found that quality nice when dealing with... passionate vocalists."
2,Kate Hepburn Once Said...,"Well, I didn't really like it. I love books about Kate Hepburn, but this one just doesn't make the list. A lot was from movie lines, thins her character said, which one could argue was her, but I expected so much more."
3,Mis-named title,"I collect nature and relaxation dvds, and am always looking for a new series. This particular dvd is nice, but it's not a rain forest. It's more like a country area with some tree, meadow, and stream scenes. The music is okay, but I always prefer an option to listen to natural sounds. Not a keeper for me"
2,New book,I purchased a new copy of Soul Happy and the book I received looks used. That's all I have to say.
4,Interesting text! Easy to read!,I gave this book 4stars because of its ease of usability. It does a great job in showing how to write the actual characters with reasoning behind it. The price is good and I'd definitely recommend it!
3,"Write Chinese, good not great","Exactly what I wanted, but then I wanted more...It covers a few characters and how they are written in many different ways. It can be a little confusing, pre-historic, ancient, modern, printed, etc. The authors feel the different forms are needed, but I really need only modern script. Also, I need more medical characters. This is Vol. one, and each of the next volumes will coaver more characters. I hope they publish them all in one book, before I graduate from TCM school. Right now, it is a lot of cash for a small book that just makes me want the next three books. Very valuble, and I'll use it for a few weeks but not return to it."
3,Mediocre,"These shoes are comfortable and functional, but have held up poorly. They scuff easily and do not take to polishing well. I'll be replacing them soon with leather shoes, which will last me far longer than the six months I've worn these."
2,Be careful what you buy from LaserLight,"This is a boxed set, a boxed set of three other individual CDs. Unfortunately they mix and match these same CDs in several sets, so you need to check the track list to see where it might also appear. Only one out of three of these disks is worth having, and I already had two of that! I wouldn't recomend this set, look somewhere else and beware the boxed sets."
4,Thought Provoking,"I really liked little Eddy Brown from the very first pages of his book. I bet he was a joy to his mother. This book shares with the reader a glimpse of what is going on inside the head of a youngster, as he tries to make sense of the world around him, and then it chronicles through parts of his life as he grows, struggles, and matures. The victory contained within the pages of his book is that he did survive, and the rest of us are better for it."
2,Everytime it gets more boring,"First and Second Season were great, all the drama going on, the fights, almost real, however, this third season is so boring !! It get most acted all the time, there's not even a story! I think the price of this set dont worth this season."
1,Disc 1 scratched,I purchased this set for my daughter's birthday. She started watching it and noticed that disc 1 was scratched. The other discs in the set were fine. I returned the scratched set and received a replacement. The replacement had the same problem - disc 1 was scratched and the other discs were fine. We returned the replacement for a refund. We went to Walmart and she selected a different movie for her birthday.
2,POOR JOB WITH DVD - Disappointing!,"Poor job done on such a large season. Best season yet, which is why I was so disappointed when I got it to find that my Tivo'd episodes were better! The DVD really did not have too many extras, that was a bummer. Seemed to be put together in a hurry. Then some wasted time on a Pepsi show that had nothing to do with the Hills. Biggest bummer was all of the music from original episodes swapped out for some crappy no name songs."
5,LA Drama,"The show may not be completely real, but who cares? The drama is still addicting and you'll find yourself going back for more."
3,the story of your police force in action,"I had never seen the original, 1951 version of Dragnet before, so I was happy to see it was available in DVD. However, I was annoyed to find that the original title and credits music had been excised and some dopey, synthesized knockoff music inserted. I'm guessing there were copyright issues or maybe the original music had been replaced when the shows were re-aired as ""Badge 714,"" but it would have been better to take a more archival approach, and leave the soundtrack as it was found. I had hoped to see Barton Yarborough as Friday's original partner, Ben Romero, but I have since learned that he only did one or two episodes before his untimely death, and only the very first episode is available for purchase anywhere, and not on DVD. All in all, a good sampling of one of the greatest shows in TV history, but no extras and you have to go some to get over that stupid music. (I just press MUTE and hum the Dragnet theme to myself.)"
1,Why did Hedrick Smith waste years of his life writing this?,"I have to read this for my AP government class. It is the worst thing I have ever read. Smith goes on for pages and pages repeating his point over and over again. It has become excruciating to read. Some of the stories that he tells are interesting but the rest, about 700 pages, is a complete waste of time."
1,This book is highly over-rated.,"Hedrick Smith's ""The Power Game"" is nothing but a reporters view of how Washington seems to be for him. All the book does is bash and crap on the political figures that our young Americans need to look-to. Unfortunately with trash like this book, everyone gets mixed ideas of how the US Gov't really works. Two thumbs down."
5,Power Game - One of the best books I've ever read,"Hedrick Smith is a superb writer. Formerly with the NY Times as chief Moscow correspondent and later as a player in the DC setting, he characterizes the Nixon/Kissinger era with an insiders report. He translates political power or the absence thereof into realistice terms which can be applied to almost any relationship, be it political, family, business or personal. An excellent, if dated read, but clearly applicable to situations today with power grabs by Obama. Pelosi and Reid."
1,Never received the item.,Never received the item. We received the other two items in the same order but not this one. But Amazon said they would refund us.
4,Very good,"This book should be required reading for undergraduates alongside a good American Government textbook. As opposed to textbook description of our governmental process, Smith's book digs a little deeper to describe how American government - and politics - really works. It is big but fairly readable. There are some flaws: the book is a bit dated as it was written in the late 80s (e.g. Smith talks about the problems of PACs in campaign but today's problem is soft money); there are a surprisingly decent number of typos and editing oversights; finally, like I mentioned, it is a large book and at some points, few as they are, where the book drags. At the least, a good teacher could use the book and pull out certain chapters that are more pertinent. ENJOY!"
3,*NOT* a reference book!,"If you are a serious hobbyist, this may not be the book for you as it is *not* a reference book. It's a series of vignettes about significance and history behind the charms on 4 charm bracelets belonging to the author's relatives. Cute but not very informative."
5,My Mother's Charms,I like this book for the picures and reasons they had particular charms.Recomend for other chatm collectors. And for general reading.
3,My Mother's Charms,This book is alot smaller in real lifecute but not that great! Would have been better a little bigger in size and content.
4,My Mother's Charms,"I bought this little book for my mom for her birthday, thinking it might help her get over the fact that I lost her charm bracelet many years ago! It didn't, but she did enjoy it very much. It is a light read, which was perfect for her, since she is recovering from a stroke. Many of the stories are set in a historical context that she can relate to. I also read it, and enjoyed it as well. Nice photos, sweet stories for each charm."
2,No Spark...,"I won't go into the story line. You can read from the above. I usually love the way Donna writes with her entertaining flair, character interactions and chemistry but I found this particular novel lacking. The main characters were one dimentional. I couldn't feel any emotion for ANY of the characters except boredom. It took me almost 5 days to read this book because well, it really didn't spark my interest....Sorry ! I can't recommend this one at all. Now I would highly recommend Donna's novel 'THE GREAT SCOT'. *** So save your money for THAT one....***"
4,Definately holds your interest,"It has been some time sinceI read a book that held my interest like the ""Sorcerer"". Couldn't put it down. After reading thetwo ""Legend"" books, I looked up the talented Donna's previous writings. While I enjoyed them, ""You've come a long way, girl."" Continued success."
2,Drums of Thunder,"The DVD is poorly shot. The sound is ok but it look like a home movie, shakey, people walking in front of the camera,most of the footage was shot with one camera."
1,Almost a home movie,"The following comments are not about the very talented drummers who are making the music. It is the production that is the problem. I had not expected a commercial DVD to be shot in such a manner that:-- there would be people walking between the camera and stage or talking loudly enough so that (at times) private conversation was picked up by the microphone.--Most of the shooting appears to be shot from a single point of view.-- There are no indications of who the groups are.-- Some of the groups shots start with the group already playing.-- The lead in the the disk shows a group playing but there is no sound.Only a couple of times does the camera jiggle so that it is obviously being poorly hand held.I would put the techincal aspects of this production at the mid to high end home movie range. The drummers are indeed good, but not up the the ""world's best"" as advertised."
1,"Not really ""the World's Best""","Bought this DVD expecting to see some of the ""World's Best"" taiko groups, but then watched it and realized it was just a free community concert of amateur taiko groups at Nisei Week in Los Angeles. I asked my friend about it, who's in one of the groups on the DVD, and she said she had no idea they were videotaped or put onto a DVD. That's messed up"
5,Tarzan author's best western,"I have read virtually all of the books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The Bandit of Hells Bend is the western I have always liked the best. As an avid fan of Shakespeare, Coleridge, Donne and many other famous poets and playwrights, I would definitely disregard Larry E's opinion concerning this book. In fact, having read as much ERB as I did as a teen greatly contributed to my scoring the second highest in a word comprehension test taken in a British Literature class in college. Furthermore, actor and screen writer Sylvester Stallone reads from another of Burroughs' westerns, The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County, in Rocky II. Its the book Rocky reads to Adrian while she is in a coma in the hospital.So please, don't listen to Larry E, or even myself. If you can nab a copy of this book sometime, judge for yourself."
3,You get what you paid for.,"The mirrors are awesome and increase my perifial vision, but..... When I first took this out of its package, one of the ear hooks broke off with little force at all. I was a little dissapointed, but I figured if I could probably figure out how to put it back on. Then the other one broke off. That was upsetting, but it was only three bucks, so I knew I couldn't really complain. After all that, I just melted some paracord and attached it to the ends and tied it to my head and everything worked out. Still irritating though."
3,Rearview Spy Glasses,"I got these to put in my kid's Christmas stockings. They were excited when they pulled them out but soon lost interest in them because they are way too big for and 9 and 10 year old's head. I tried them on and they were a bit big for me. However, I could stand and appear to be looking out the back door while watching my husband sit on the couch picking his nose."
5,Great price,I bought these for the boys I watch and they love them!! They were a reat price too! Thank you!
2,It is good but large,It is good but large.this is the problemthe price is cheap considered as an advantgethe pakage is in agood status.
1,not worth it,"The glasses arrived broken - one at the earpiece connection to the frame, the other set a small plastic piece was again broken by the screw by the earpiece and was ready to come apart. The seller was VERY kind though and provided a refund as he stated he was having quality issues from his provider. It was hard to see out of them anyhow, but my 6 and 9 year made the best of them while they lasted!"
3,Finish easily scrapes off,"I purchased these for our grand daughter for Christmas and they arrived with a spot on the lens where the finish had been damaged. The packaging was a bit flimsy. I contacted the company that sent these and their customer service was superb. Emailed my problem and they instantly resolved the issue.I gave FIVE STARS for educational value because I discussed (with our grand children) looking all around you when you're out walking to see who is behind you and near you, be aware. I don't mean they should be neurotic about it, but should be aware. So.. a good lesson learned.Great customer service, I would deal with this company again."
3,Could be too big for what you're looking for,"3 stars rating doesn't mean it's bad. Quite nice, just bigger than I expected, considering it was recommended by Amazon to buy with the 10 inch Anolon skillet. OK for omelets and pancakes, but way to big to stir stuff. Seems one of those things better to go and try at a brick-and-mortar store."
4,Good size,"Good size but i have one with no hole and i like more.Well constructed, beauty, you can get a pizza slice into a oven easy, is very long 4 star because i really prefer with no hole, when i get cheese on my skillet i have some problems."
1,Buyers Beware!!! Do not buy this product!,I bought this DVD and returned it for a refund. The picture and sound quality were horrible. Don't buy any Triad Productions products. My 1-star reviews keep getting removed by these scammers. I will keep posting them!
2,OK for Very Old Movie,The quality is marginal. Many movies from this time period are of much higher quality. Lack of menu and extras. Just OK but cool movie overall.
4,rose water,"smells great and goes on clean. I use it as a toner and also in my homemade vitamin c serum. Love the way it smells and it is easily absorbed. Would order again, just love the smell of it."
1,Not for the inexperienced weaver,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book as it does not include basic draft information for the weave structures. Neither the ""flap"" information or descriptions of the book indicate that this is an advanced book and not a ""how to"" book of weave structures and drafts. Perhaps later on I will understand how to derive construction information from weave structure. When that happens this book may be useful. Until then it is of limited to no use since it does not include basic (threading, tie-up, treading) draft information for the journeyman or inexperienced weaver."
3,not for keyfit30,"It does not fit the keyfit30 car seat and i was surprised at how loose it was on the product. the picture makes it look like the material is taut. it may work for some ppl, but i returned mine."
1,Lite Bundle Me,"I got it for a EvenFlo baby seat & it fits like crap!!! Does't stay on the top part of the carrier(right at her head!!) It's a newer seat manufactured in Sept. 2008 , so maybe thats why? I was going to get the fleece one because we travel to chilly areas but now I won't."
3,"So-so product, paying for the name","The bundle me is fine, however you can pick similar items up for cheaper at local stores.It is very lightweight, not suitable for colder climes."
3,use a blanket,"this is nice quality and a great idea, but i only used it a few times. a stroller blanket will do the trick."
2,"Boring, sad, meandering, couldn't finish it...","I never give up on a book, but this one just lost me. I got through 3/4 of it, and just gave up. The characters seemed very one-dimensional to me, they grew without growing if that makes sense. I couldn't bear another drunken father story, or mother talking to herself (but really to her mother who's back in Nigeria) or the girls working through problem after problem with no real resolution. I felt like they were hamsters on a wheel, as was I for reading the same thing over and over. Finally I jumped off the wheel and moved on. Thank God. I was really disappointed because I feel the author had a story there, and I had read positive reviews. Oh well. Maybe someone else can enlighten me, or maybe her next novel will show me how wrong I am."
2,The darker side of twins,"This started interestingly enough...twins that seemed joined from a past life. But it quickly derailed into non-stop depressing, life-altering tragedies. It WAS well written, despite the authors intentional use of poor grammar (the character's London and Nigerian accents). But the ending was meaningless and a true disappointment for this reader who stuck it out, only to be disappointed. I was hoping for another Audrey Niffenegger""s ""Her Fearful Symmetry"", but I got a Thomas Hardy remake instead."
2,I didn't notice any difference,I took a stab that it would provide more workout energy but neither my wife nor I noticed any difference.
3,who knows?,"after three months of taking regularly, have noticed no bp change, nor any other health benefit. still taking, but not optimistic."
