3,"mediocre b-movie with rutger hauer, good production values","Interesting concept, satan, rutger hauer, sci-fi,ruined largely by poor writing and unclear story direction but partially redeemed by grizzled rutger hauer (as well as decent acting all around) and a scary monster that bears an uncanny resemblance to the ""venom"" character from the spiderman series. I'm partial to Rutger Hauer but this is far from his best movie and unfortunately far from his worst. Rent Ladyhawke if you want a good sci-fi movie with rutger hauer."
5,"Good Movie, but not for that money!!!","I own the VHS Copie of this Movie, and I must say it is a classic. I'm very disappointed to see that people are trying to sell this movie for as much as $158.00. I think that's a little outragious and no wonder why people go out and download these movies illegally. I'd probably do the same. Also when you want to put that $ sign down at a reasonable price, then you might get a sale. Untill then, I won't Pay that much for a dvd. Period!!"
4,I Need this Movie on DVD!,"Ok, so it isn't High Art but sure-as-shootin' it is entertaining. Despite the abundace of action the relationships between the characters develope and evolve, so you could say its a people movie. The dialogue is great and this movie has one of the finest collection of quips and one-liners to ever come from a single movie. Especially, if you like big guns. It has a few touching, quiet moments and they actually add to the movie instead of slowing it down. I have worn through two VHS copies of ""Split Second"" and I really need it to come out on DVD because I know I'll be watching it for years to come. It has a little bit of romance, and a lot of action. What more could you want from a movie?"
1,Rutger Hauer.......What Do You Expect,"This movie is despiccable. It is cinematography at its absolute worst. Aside from the catchy tagline, the title has no bearing on or relevenace to the movie; seconds split at any point. We were led to believe all-movie-long that the alien was unstoppable and indefitagable. We were incredibly wrong: Rutger Hauer and his psychic sidekick have NO trouble killing it at the end. There is random and unarousing nudity woven into the movie, a poor attempt to keep the viewer's interest very concrete. Aside from all that, its not too bad..."
3,Weak plot,"Rowland has done a good job of conveying the sights, sounds, smells, social structure and traditions of 17th century Japan. Sano, while in his role unwillingly, is both physically and intellectually capable, and I enjoyed his dedication and humanity. I found it slow at times, and the plot weak, but still a decent read."
2,Too much perversion to be entertaining.,"Rowland obviously knows Japan well. Her story could be a real winner--exotic, intriguing, unique. However, she has gone too far. She has infused the story with sensationalist descriptions of various perversions, whether to make it easier for the reader to loathe the antagonist, or who knows what. After a fashion the story irritates the sensibilities more than it entertains. I quit reading with less than 100 pages to go. My wife was reading Bundori as I read Shinju, and she came to the same conclusion independent of any input from me. Try again, Ms. Rowland. Adultery and murder are evil enough deeds for your villains; they don't need to go on to pedophilia or sadism."
4,Shogun JR,"I have enjoyed all the entries to this series. While, I still feel James Clavells Shogun is the best historical fiction about this time period, this series is pretty good. If you liked Shogun or are interested in 17th Century Japan you will like these books. The mystery part is pretty good, but the setting and the details are even better."
3,Good but not great,"Ms. Joh-Rowland has given us a glimpse of 17th century Japan which is much more interesting than the history books. And by using a mystery as a vehicle, this book is very readable and ""unputdownable"". However, since this is her first book, her plotting needs room for improvement. A reader can guess the resolution halfway through the book. Still, it is a good first effort and I am hoping the next Saro Ichiro novels will be tighter and unpredictable."
3,"Promising series debut, not much mystery, too much travelog","Historical mysteries have a tough balancing act between milieu and mystery. Shinju is the first in a series set in late seventeenth century Japan. The detective character is by nature a man whose need to know the truth wars with his self-interest and that of his family. He's an idealist, trained as a samurai in an era when the samurai's main function--warfare--has been controlled and suppressed. It's an interesting conflict, somewhat clumsily executed--in this episode at least. Despite some misdirection, the mystery isn't very mysterious; the author devotes more attention to the cultural, social, and historical background than to the mystery--explaining too much along the way. This isn't unusual in first books in a series set in exotic times and places. It could have used a little humor, but I enjoyed it enough to plan to read more.The Kindle edition was free of significant formatting errors and had no typographical errors that I noticed."
5,A Solid Debut,"Although I do not like the cover of this current edition and am not even that big a fan of Japanese history, I am a fan of detective fiction and love to dabble in historical detectives. Thus I picked up this book.The novel is very strong. The characters are extremely well-rendered as is the setting and atmosphere. The detecting portions of the novel are not quite up to speed but his is her first effort and some allowances must be made.I read the book quickly, it held my attention throughout and I already have the next 5 books in the series on deck.If you like detective fiction, then this book is for you. If you like historical fiction, the novel also satisfies on that front. If you just like a flat out enjoyable read, then pick up this one. I highly recommend it."
4,Enter the world of pleasure and plots...,"It seems to be a simple double suicide, a shinju, between two mismatched lovers. But to Sano Ichiro not everything seems to fit. Clues point out that there was something else is going on. But where to start? Which family should he investigate? And why are people in the upper ranks so fast to dismiss his idea of murder? As the layers are peeled back we found plots within plots within plots, with fast action, gritty characters, and plot twists that force us to see everything in a new light. Just the kind of mystery I enjoy. Get it new or used."
5,excellent thriller - translated into Czech by me,"I have translated the book for the publishing house DOMINO - Ostrava, Czech Republic. It is similar to Judge Ti - very popular in the country. Hopefully I will translate Bundori or other books of Laura Joh Rowland."
3,"Cliched protagonist ""rebel bucks the system""","I am a bit tired of reading mysteries and action books where the hero is one who ""goes against all his superiors and hurts people along the way in his/her quest for truth and justice"". It's getting old. Always the rebel with a cause, Sano knows better than everyone. But I very much enjoyed the descriptive narrative of Japan and the insight into behavior. A most excellent turn of events with regard to the ""mystery"" part of the story, I was very impressed."
4,Well worth the read!,"A murder mystery set in medieval Japan, Shinju was a fascinating look at the customs and mores of the time. The well written story and believable charactors, transport the reader to another time and place - I really enjoyed this book!"
2,"Rich imagery, mediocre writing.","The author does an excellent job of describing life in 17th century Japan. However, while the tapestry of the environment is rich, the writing is not. This is the author's first book, and it shows. The characters are engaging, if somewhat stilted and the plot is mediocre. Imagery is fine, but the author needlessly stoops to shocking the reader with perversions. The protagonist's internal conflict is at times believable, but there are instances where it really does not make sense. Overall, it could be better, but it is not a bad first attempt."
3,"Interesting Setting, Less Compelling Mystery","A highly detailed series debut set in Tokyo (Edo) circa 1690. The detective is a newly appointed samurai police officer who quickly manages to piss off his boss and underlings by sticking his naively inquisitive nose into various matters, most notably, a ritual lovers' suicide he is ordered not to investigate. Of course our hero has an inner conflict which rages between duty and justice which battles most of the book, as he gets himself deeper and deeper in hot water. The mystery itself is nothing special, and relies on a villain who is more than slightly crazed. The fun in the book is in all the little details about urban Japanese life and customs of the era, as well as the political background. This is presented very fluidly and is well-woven into the plot."
3,"Saves time, but be careful with the errors.","1) It saves you time by arranging the related sections, without a very expensive pricetag.2) But be careful about the careless errors.3) Also, it does not explain the abbreviates in texts or mathmatical functions; the answer texts provided are often unable to explain the whole idea clearly.Summary: The reader is expected to have reasonable level of understanding and familiarity about the contents. You have to buy / have access to the reading materials to make this book meaningful. It works as a draft for your own study notes, but will not work as a replacement for the assigned reading materials."
2,PowerPoint automation oversights,"I was disappointed when I tried to do some automation in PowerPoint. The oversight is in chapter 5 (PowerPoint Solution Development) where the author completely neglects to mention that there is no auto_open macro in PowerPoint. By default, you have to run the VBE code manually in order to get to initialize the PowerPoint application object. I have discovered that to get the auto_open feature you have to write a macro in a new PowerPoint document, then convert save it as a PowerPoint Add-In."
2,Textbook-like,"I bought the Studyworks Science Deluxe to brush up on basics, and also have fun using the software, but it did not meet my expectations, because all of the information is simply scanned in, and it is not very user-friendly. The software is less explanatory than the textbook itself, and it does not really capture the user's attention, or present an understandable version of the material."
5,Baldwin fuel filter,"Amazon is awsome! Great price, quick shipping.this Baldwin fuel filter is a great replacement for the stock fuel filter used on the 88-93 ford 7.3 idi engine'seasy to install and elimates pesky leaks prone with the stock filter. A great product at a reasonable price."
4,Good Old Outdoor Knowledge,This is a really neat book that displays good old-fashioned outdoor wisdom. Learn everything from fishing tips to hunting tips and everything inbetween. I only wished it had more pictures or illustrations.
3,So-So,"This pair had only a couple of hits --- ""When"" being theirbiggest, making it to # 5 on Billboard's Top Pop 100 chartand well known and easily recognized by oldies music fans;""Forget Me Not"" making it to # 12, but seldom played on theoldies stations so it's been largely forgotten in spite of itstitle.Their only other two charted songs (""It's Only The Beginning""at # 42 and ""Sweet Sugar Lips"" at # 97) have been mostlyforgotten over the years.I always liked ""Jumpin' Jack"", though it never made the charts.The rest of the songs on this CD are basically just albumfiller, many of them being OK, but overall just ""So-So"".I bought a copy of this CD without regret. It has 30 tracksand I recommend that anyone interested in it not pay over $15for it, since it is available below that price.Enjoy it --- I do!"
5,The duo who went pop,"This CD shows the broad spectrum of the Kalin Twins talent. The brothers recorded for Decca Records from 1957 to 1961 and scored with four chart makers. All of them are included in this 30 track collection. (When, Forget Me Not, Sweet Sugar Lips and It's Only The Beginning)The arrangements (Mostly by Jack Pleis) are pop but commercial for the period. The harmony and basic thrust is pop with evidence of early R&B. Some later tracks were cut in Nashville and show the producing talent of Owen Bradley."
1,When,"Ordinary except for ""When"" & ""Three O'clock Thrill"", the rest have very basic Rock & Roll rhyming lyrics. The history of the Twins is interesting."
4,universal lid,"I like this item because I can use it with any size of pot and pan. However, because it sticks very well, it is a bit hard to open the lid when the food it hot."
3,Expected More,"I have had this camera for a couple of months now. Some of the pictures that I have taken are beautiful. The colors are bright and the picture crisp. However, the other half of the photos, mostly outdoors shots are grainy. The camera is easy to use in the Auto mode, but the other functions are difficult to learn. It is also a little heavy and bulky. I prefer a smaller camera-and that's what I expected- but received this instead. It looks neat, though! I will buy an Olympus next time."
2,A disappointment,"I shopped and shopped for a camera that I would use a on a big 6 month trip I was taking. I decided on the Canon because of the superior lens and wanted a clamshell, for the durability. However, with this camera, I found that the clamshell lenscover would often slip out of groove and thus even when I would ""open"" the camera, it would not get triggered to turn on. So I'd have to open and close it a bunch of times in order to get it to work. Then, after about a year, the camera started to take fuzzy pictures all the time and neither a tripod, new batteries or faster film seemed to fix it. I am so irritated that I spent the money for a camera I got so little use out of."
3,truth in advertisement,previously advertized as z90W.switched labels once error was found.this version does not have date/time options
2,No Caption & Date/Time features as advertised !!!!!,"As with most of us, I received this camera with no Caption & Date/Time features. I am going to return it for a refund. I don't want to go thru the hassle of requesting for a replacement when there is no guarantee that they will ship the right one next time."
1,Attention!!,This one is not the model with caption! Amazon sent the wrong item to me again! What's wrong with it? How can our customers protect our rights?
2,Missing the caption,"Lots of these cameras have been shipped without the caption. I also returned the camera asking for a refund. After they received it, I got an email from Amazon saying that the error had been fixed and they could ship out the 'correct' item, if I prefer, instead of a refund.I accepted but am still awaiting thew camera - let's see if it is still missing the caption..."
2,Not particularly worthwhile for me,Difficult to follow the action if you're not familiar with the layout of an aircraft carrier. A deck plan graphic would have helped.
1,WHAT A JOKE!,WARNING! This is not a good movie. One doesn't even have nudity in it.They should sell this as a documentary.THIS SUCKED! I was sooo pissed when I watched them it wasnt even funny.THIS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!
3,Believe it or not this movie isn't that bad.,"Although this movie isn't on the same level as ""Heathers"" or ""The Rivers Edge"" it does have similar qualities.Even Luke Perry isn't too bad in this.This is his best movie although that isn't saying a whole lot."
2,bench difficult to assemble,I was disappointed with the quality of the product and how difficult it was to put together. It was overpriced for what it is.
4,About The Dark Trail,"Quite simply, an excellent Western novel.If Elmore Leonard collaborated with Dashiell Hammett to create a Western novel, it would look very much like Ed Gorman's Dark Trail.The characters are very well drawn. The writing is terse to complement the overall noir tone of the story.The climax is stunning.If you like Leonard's Western stories--and they are excellent--you will probably like this novel as well.Highly recommended."
2,"Random, noisy and bizzare.","I bought this ablum based on the description and on good reviews I had read elsewhere. However, this album did not live up to the hype. I was expecting melodic, futuristic, ambient music like artist Zero One. However, cyberCHUMP just seems to combine random, noisy and bizzare sounds that gave me a headache! I listened to the CD twice, to see if I would enjoy it more the second time, but I didn't. If you like your ambient music noisy with little or no structure, then this is for you. Otherwise skip this CD."
2,Inaccurate subtitle,"This 2001 book recounts the Marilyn Sheppard murder, the trial of her husband, the reversal of his conviction by the U.S. Supreme Court. the second trial when he was represented by F. Lee Bailey, his life after prison, and his death in 1970. I found the first two-thirds of the book told an interesting story in non-scintillating prose, but the final section, when the Sheppard Estate sued the County, was boring and showed that the the subtitle of the book is hype, not too accurate. The author makes at least one egregious error, when he says FDR appointed Harold Burton the the supreme Court, showing a lack of basic research on the part of the author. I am not sure the time I spent reading this book was well-spent."
5,Fun -- fearless -- fabulous,"""The Wrong Man"" is one of the best books I've read this year. I'm privileged to be acquainted with the author, Jim Neff, but I'd say this about anyone who wrote such an outstanding book. This is a thriller and investigative tour de force at once. Reminiscent of ""In Cold Blood,"" it's taut, lively and tense. I was hooked again and again by intriguing turns in the writing, especially, perhaps, wondering about the strange boy who loved to rearrange furniture, and of course wondering if Dr. Sam really did it. I turned pages quickly. Time -- and worries of war -- flew. I found out so much more about the troubled boy and the wealthy doctor and every other element in the book, not least of all the failings of the criminal justice system and the misuse of the press. I loved Jim's asides about what was new in his investigation, and what contradicted long-held beliefs and questionable claims. The book is fun to read, it's fearless, and I think it will be a best seller."
2,The Wrong Book,"""The Wrong Man"" examines with depth the tangled web of characters and theories surrounding the endlessly fascinating case of Dr. Sam Sheppard. However, having read widely on this subject, few of the theories presented in The Wrong Man are new. In particular, a great deal of research-based data concerning Richard Eberling was compellingly presented in ""Mockery of Justice -- the True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case, by Cynthia L. Cooper and Sam Rees Sheppard, published in 1995 (hardback) and 1998 (paperback). Unfortunately, much of the research done by Ms. Cooper for her book now appears in ""The Wrong Man."" While I am glad to see that writers continue to delve into this tragic case, there is little new in this book, and I enjoyed reading ""Mockery of Justice"" a great deal more."
3,"Good book, but CD was not included","This book was advertised as including an audio CD, which was not in the shipment I received. Instead, I purchased it independently for $15."
4,Pretty good and straighforward introduction to Hindi grammar,"I actually took this course at the Universityof California, Berkeley from the author. Itis fairly straightforward. Of course, thereis nothing like having a native speaker aroundto help you learn the pronunciations of someof the constructs."
5,Undeniably the best there is,"I don't think I need to praise DJ Spinna, his music speaks volumes for his skill and talent. Anything he touches is instantly better, there is literally NOTHING that this man has produced that's bad. Cop this album."
3,"Very good, but also a bit commercial","Hmmm, this is a tough one for me to review. The songs I like on this album, I REALLY like, but honestly I never even listened to the rest of the album, just couldn't get into it. ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" became a much listened to track for me; being a bit self destructive myself, it was as if Pink had somewhat shared my thoughts when she sang this song. Parts of this album are a bit too much hard-driving rock for my taste, and I felt that it came off as being a bit commercial, rather than a showcase of real talent."
4,HUH?,"Alright first of all let me tell you I am a great P!Nk fan. O.K. This cd is very good, very rich , and very different from the old ""Can't Take Me Home"" Sound. My favorite song is P!nk's newest song Just like a pill, What a beat. And Respect and 18 wheeler are cool to. P!nk has accomplished so much with this cd, it has currently sold more than 3 million copies!!! Thats somthing to be proud of! People say that the colour Pink calms you, But the singer will have you dancing , and singing along to the rockin' Loud lyrics, Hope you like it!"
3,pink CD,I would recomend this CD. Most songs are of the dance / pop style. Pink is still a bit young in sound and writing style but There are a few songs that show where Pink will be on her next CD which is more in the rock style.
5,Great album,"This album is great. I like the songs very much, but not each of them. This album is my favorite Pink album. Pink is better than Cristina Aguilera and Avril Lavigne. I recommend it for you. Buy it!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I bought this CD for the song ""Get the party started"", but my favorite song on this CD is Misery. It reminds of Bette Midler from the movie the Rose. Family portrait is very touching also. I'm 37 and my kids are 13 and 9, I think it's really great we can enjoy the same music."
1,why don't I like Pink?,"Maybe it's because the actual music in her songs is the stalest, blandest bubblegum rehash that's dominated the airwaves in ages. Only ""Just Like A Pill"" starts off sounding kinda cool, but then falls flat on its face with that tired chorus. Gross."
3,It's OK,The CD was OK. I thought it would be much better than it was. I havn't played the whole CD yet but it certainly isn't the best CD I've heard. I always like enhanced CD's so that's one of the few good things about the CD.
2,I promise you...I'm not crazy,This CD isn't good. It is all about sex. And drugs...who needs to here about that? Avril Lavinge is AWSOME. And I admit even Hilary Duff is better than this trash. Don't get this CD it's bad news.
2,Yuck,"I bought this CD because I like the song ""Let's get the party started."" But, frankly, it was a waste of money. The CD is horrible. The lyrics are harsh and full of language I wouldn't want to blare. Big mistake. I wish ""Let's get the party started"" was on a single - then I could sell this CD & just get the single. ""Pink"" (the gal) has an attitude and I hope some day she gets rid of the mean attitude - it shows in her music, and that's NOT a good thing. GOOD music is born out of love - not hatred."
1,Don't get it!!!!!,IF YOU WANT AN ALBUM THAT DOSE NOT CUSS DON'T GET THIS ANYWAYS PINK MOST OF THE TIME ONLY HAS THREE INCHS OF CLOTHS ON!!!!!!!!!!
1,"I Don't ""Undaztand""!","Just as Pink's hair has changed from fuschia to blond, her music has changed from funky to bland. Gone are the funky R & B street sounds from her first album, leaving only a mediocre effort to move into the genre of ""girl rock"". Why would an artist who showed such promise with her debut change everything for the sophomore effort? I don't ""undaztand""! My suggestion is to wait and see what the next cd brings. If you absolutely have to buy this one, look for it used. I'm sure there will be plenty of copies!"
4,Good,Prety Good she has prety good songs my favortie Song is Get The Party Started she has alot of great music videos I wood anytime vote her for best music video so any good thank you
3,"Pink's cool, but not for guys","I bought this thinking that it was a compltely solid piece of work, and to my surprise it really isn't. Yes, a lot of the songs here ""Family Portrait,"" ""Get The Party Started"" and the awesome ""Don't Let Me Get Me,"" are some of the best pop songs released in the past few years, but the whole album doesn't do it for me, especially R-E-S-P-E-C-T, which sounds ironic coming from a girl that doesn't have respect for pretty much anything. This album will go down as a classic and a groundbreaking album for Pink, who, because of it, is now a well established artist, but nevertheless, it's not a guy's album. Just look at the name of the artist, for starters! The best cuts here are really the singles."
1,Disappointed,"Sorry, but I can't agree with the majority of the glaring reviews for this cd. This cd has three good songs on it; and those are the three that played on the radio. The rest of the cd is absolute garbage, and wouldn't have sold had it been put on the radio. The first song sounds good, until she is stopped and asked if she's doing an X-lax commerical. This makes sense, because we'd all much rather hear them talk about X-lax than listen to the song!!! (sarcasm) Songs like Dear Diary are terrible. I've listened to this cd about three times, and then I filed it away somewhere so I wouldn't have to see it anymore. Seriously, save your money. If you really like ""Just Like a Pill"", ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" and ""Get This Party Started"", buy them as singles, don't waste your time with the entire cd."
2,Pink shouldn't have gone 4 Non Blonde!,"I tried to listen to her new cd objectively and not to compare it to ""Can't Take Me Home"" since it has been made clear that it was not going to be the same style.Well, Linda RUINED Pink!!the words may be good but, i just cant sit and listen to this cd over and over like i was looking forward to doing. Only about half the songs are worth my time. the songs had no soul to them. no anger! no angst! no love! no GRRRL power! just passive lack of emotion.Please, Pink! Your voice is fabulous and i look forward to a new cd with a new producer."
4,"Heavy, but not 4 R'n'B fanz!","Really great album, meaningful tunes and once again the lyrics are straight from the heart.Hands down 2 p!nk, she did a great job. Alot more pop than her first album though."
2,It Sounds Weaker the Second Time Around.,"Pink swears that she's freed herself from her r&b flavored debut ""Can't Take Me Home"" and is now doing material of her choosing. But when it gets right down to it, ""M!zzundaztood"" is just as contrived as her last record, and probably even more so with her dubious ""I've-gone-punk-now"" stance. No doubt, there are a handful of good songs here, such as the single ""Get the Party Started."" But she elevates herself to a pedestal above Britney Spears on the supremely irritating and self-absorbed ""Don't Let Me Get Me."" And while Dallas Austin makes a welcome impression on the album, her choice of Linda Perry (of 4 Non Blondes fame) is questionable. All in all, it's not a terrible album, but it's a shallow, borderline one. With a couple more albums under her belt, maybe P!nk can earn our respect for her as an original artist."
4,"Gr8, But ...","This album is gr8 but most(well, not most)of the songs are boring.Here are her weakest songs:MissundaztoodMiseryDear DiaryEventuallyLonely GirlGone To California(Worst Song)My VietnamSo I could say her best song is ""Just Like a Pill."""
5,Great CD,"When Pink first came out I dismissed her as being a Britney type wannabe. I thought she did have considerably more singing talent than Britney, and with this CD I definately think she has talent. She wrote most of the songs, and I love the range of songs. They don't all sound the same, and they are not pop rubbish-they have depth."
4,great,"...great CD.! my fav track is ""lonely girl"" but their all great, shes a pretty unique person, p!nk. so try her out."
4,Dope!!,"This chick is all dat!!When I hear the groove of ""Let's Get This Party Started,"" as well as Pink's well thought out lyrics, I can't help but jump up and down with energy.And I thought Britney was the Queen of Pop!! Boy was I ever fooled. Unlike Britney and so many other pop star divas, Pink sings from her heart, shoots from her hip, keeps it real and basically busts out any other cliched phrasing you can think of. What I'm trying to say is:The girl knows how to work it!!You go, girl!!This album is all that...plus a bag of chips. If you don't believe me, check out the intro.PEACE OUT!!"
4,"Pink comes out of left field, does a 180 with her music","the first time I saw Pink was that video she did with Christinia, Lil' Kim, and Maya. Then I watch an espiode of MTV's Diary, with her as the subject. She got my interest. Once I saw her again on MTV's Making the Video, I was hooked. I love ""GetThis Party Started"", so much so that I bought her CD, Missundaztood not long after that. I love almost every song, espically the bluesy duet that she does with Steve Tyler, ""Misery"". With this new CD, Pink proves to be an artist of considerable talent. I can't wait for her next one."
4,Good,"I bought Pink's first CD years ago and wasn't impressed but with one song. (I hate when that happens) so I haven't been in a rush to run out and purchase more material from her. But then I heard Dear Mr. President and ran out and bought I'm not dead. Absolutely wonderful CD. So I decided to backtrack and buy her popular missundaztood. This is a good CD with the title track, don't let me get me, just like a pill, get the party started, and lastly, family portait making this purchase well worth the money. If you skipped over this CD, you're doing yourself a disservice."
4,I'm not misunderstood! this album is great,".....Pink does a wonderful job with this album. Every single song has a message and very nice melodies. Don't compare Pink with the other crud that people call music (i.e., Britney Spears, etc.) because Pink has something to say. She's not a sex symbol, her music is heartfelt, and I would let my children listen to her. Very good job."
4,Missundaztood-Not anymore!,"Pink debut album wasn't that bad, but wasn't the best either.And I am so over all these ppl saying"" What about her R&B?"" I think she still loves it, but she's not recording what ""L.A. told {her}..."" anymore.Pre-""Pink"" days she sang in punk/ pop/ r&b,& gospel.It's the release of ""Missundaztood"" where she shines. She shows how versitle her voice is. I think ""Family Portrait"" & ""just like a Pill"" are creative & they're not your typical realtionships gone bad songs. I also love ""Misery"" w/ Steven Tyler. @ this point I think Pink can sing anything!"
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"Initially, I put the headphones on at the listening station of the Megastore to hear ""Get the Party Started"", which is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I had no intention of buying this CD.I was surprised that the rest of this CD is nothing like what I had heard of Pink before. I sort of expected the whole CD to be riddled with over-sampled, over-produced R&B/Hip-Hop tracks which I wasn't terribly keen on. So impressive was her voice on the other tracks I heard, that I bought this.I have only really listened a couple of times, but so far, I like it. It has alot more to offer than what you would think and it really showcases her vocal skills.I suppose that if you want more of a Hip-Hop feel, you may be dissapointed. If not, buy this, her style is new and refreshing..makes you think that the horrible vapid pop machine that spawned Britney and 'Nsync is gasping it's last breath and only talented artists will survive."
5,Pink poors her soul out on this album,Pink has made a great album with Misunderstood. i totally believe she is just that. this album is edgy and soulful and peaceful a must have. she writes her own lyrics. her lyrics are very powerful. she's got potential. 18 wheeler is a really cool song along with family portrait and dear diary. there are a lot of good songs on this album. if you ever feel that you've been misunderstood yourself or really anything in life this is a good in your face truthful tasteful album.
3,I love some of the CD,"When I first got the CD I thought it would be better than it was. Get the Party Started is my favorite track, my second favorite would be Missunderstood it fun but the rest of the album is not really good."
5,OMG Pink rocks!,"Pink is the greatest singer ever! Get this CD NOW! That last reviewer is the stupid one for saying this CD is for ""stupid"" kids.Anyway, this Cd is just AWESOME! All the songs are good but i really like Respect, 18 wheeler,Don't let me get me, and Lonly Girl.BUY THIS CD NOW!"
5,Hey! Check out this CD!!!,"Hey!This is a really awesome CD! And as that one guy said that his 9 year old was listening 2 this, well, what 9 year old kid is gonna be listening 2 P!nk? And if they are, well, then they're 2 young. But what I wanted 2 say was that this is awesome! My fav songs by P!nk are: ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" and ""Most Girls"". Her other songs are really good 2. And the CD M!ssaundaztood is definetly full of more great songs. I fully love P!nk 'cuz she's totally talented and her lyrics are amazing and really get her point across.So to everyone reading this, BUY THIS CD; U WON'T REGRET IT!!!!Love Ya,Hanna"
4,talented girl,"...the lyrics are for the most part upbeat and empowering for young women-""Respect"" is great."
2,eh?,This is a bad cd. Its really messy. All the songs sounds messed up alittle. Except maybe her singles. But i mean...California? Thats a bad song. And My Vietnam? GOd? What was she on when she picked it? Well i'm not sayign its an all bad cd. I really do injoy ' Get the party started' and ' Missundaztood'. And ' 18' wheeler. Thats about it... i suggest u jus download the songs. Alot easier n cheaper.
4,Get The Cd Started,"This CD was very good. It mostlikely would hae recieved 5 stars but there was this one song that i just can't stand. I thought the CD was very outgoing and is a good follow up for 'can't take me home'.Get this party started was my favorite song. I thought it was sweet how she add 'My Vietnam' to the album (she and her father used to sing it when she was little). The songs sort of had the same vibe, but not the always so recognizeble vibe but THE vibe thats the perfect fit."
2,"Okay, it doesn't suck","It doesn't suck. I think that Pink is pretty cool and I love her philosophy and the fact that she loves Britney Spears and N'sync, the best people around! I also love her song 'Get the Party Started' it is cool, but overall I wouldn't buy the album. I know she doesn't think she's pretty but she is. I don't totally hate it. It's okay."
4,M!ssundaztood is P!nk's Best!,"This album starts out like it is an easy 5 Star album but loses steam. It is a great album and P!nk is a great artist!P!nk is better then any of those other bubble gum artist!P!nk is like Madonna and Janet Jackson, only better!One day her name will be as big as Mariah Carey & Whitney HoustonGo buy this CD and go buy Mariah Carey's Charmbracelet album too!"
5,Absolutely Essential,"This is the German import of M!ssundaztood, it includes the exclusive track Catch 22, an R&B dance track that fans of her first album (Can't Take Me Home, 2000) will absolutely love. If you liked Get The Party Started, you must buy this album. Check my reviews (December 19,2001) for a full review of this record, but believe me when I say it is one of the best of last year."
3,It's not missundaztood to me!,I love this cd. It rocks!!! Almost every song on this cd meets my disire and I am lovin' it!!
2,Maybe change isn't always a good thing. . .,"I must say I was feeling the first album, ""Can't Take me Home"" however, maybe she flipped the script a little too much too soon with this second go'round. Don't get me wrong, I really like Pink, just the old Pink. I don't know the reason behind the change but perhaps there is a lesson to be learned: Change isn't always a good thing. There are some tracks that are enjoyable on the album but the first album I could listen the whole way through and like every track. Not this time. If you are an R&B fan, this really isn't that type of album. Maybe she'll go back to the original her on the next one. The only change I like was her look. She looks really good. She seems undecided on what music category she wants to be in. The title suits the album, because I sure ""Missundaztood"" what she was about. Come on Pink, you had a good thing going, don't mess it up now!"
5,Pink reveals her true colors,"When an artist decides to make an album that they want to make, it's a great thing. Pink (aka Alicia Moore) finally drops the fake R&B act and reveals herself on MISSUNDAZTOOD. Her voice is raw and gritty, more than usual. Musically it's still pop but with a more rock edge. Pink co-wrote many of the songs on MISSUNDAZTOOD along with Linda Perry. Lyrically MISSUNDAZTOOD sways between the bubbley (""get the party started"") and the personal (""family portrait""). Another confession comes up on ""don't let me get me"" -- which she says ""tired of being compared/to damn britney spears""/. The bluesy rock duet ""misery"", which features Steven Tyler is very well done. The current hit ""get the party started"" is awesome. It instantly puts you on the dance floor. Alothough MISSUNDAZTOOD is personal it still packs in the grooves. Pink is comfortable and honest which makes MISSUNDAZTOOD better than CAN'T TAKE ME HOME. She's grown and it shows."
5,You won't believe how good this is...,"...you really won't. The dance floor anthem, ""Get The Party Started"" in no way prepares you for the power and breadth of this album. Don't mistake this effusiveness for fan worship. This is genuinely a terrific album. You get the feeling you're watching an artist stretch, take a few risks, and just hit one out of the park. It's easy to see teen pop fans liking a few tunes on this record, but I think the modern rock, ""Red Hot Chili Peppers""-type fan would be surprised at how much they would enjoy this record. Many of these songs seriously rock, and her lyrics often have an Eminem-like immediacy and veracity to them.The extra DVD is pure gravy, with similarly impressive videos. You should buy this for the album, and consider the DVD as dessert."
1,Pink is about as real as Avril Lavigne,"Pink is another pop artist whose music and image I loathe (alongside Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton). There is nothing tough or ""punk"" about this twit. Her hair color is about original as Avril Lavigne's attitude. ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" is just about the stupidest song title that any artist come up with (except for Aaron Carter's ""The Clapping Song""). I swear if I hear ""Don't Let Me Get Me"", ""Just Like a Pill"", and ""Get This Party Started"" one more time, I am going to use my stereo as the sacrificial lamb for a voodoo ritual to try to make my local radio stations stop playing her godawful music incessantly. I can't stand her new song ""Family Portrait"". Any wonders why I can't stand listening to artists [whine]and moan about their personal life without any form of redemption or hope. ""Missundaztood"" is just a vile piece of work that should only be used as a coaster or as a frisbee."
5,Love It!,"Pink is a various artist. She can do it all. R&B, pop and rock. This CD is a good mixture of all three. My favorite track is the duet she does with Steven Tyler from Aerosmith ""Misery"". It has a bluesy feel to it. The perfect song to listen to when you fell kind of down and don't want to be cheered up at the moment."
4,A Sweet Surprise,"Pink's first album went unnoticed to me. it was th height of the teen pop movement in pop and I wasn't going to give someone named pink the time of day.One day, I went in to a bar and i heard them blastin "" Don't let me Get Me"" and ""Just Like A Pill"". The voice drew me in. She sounded like an angry Annie Lennox singing ballsy lyrics. There was no evidence of any teen pop her. This CD is her first step yto becoming a full fledged rocker. I bought the CD the next day and I haven't regretted it since. Sure the lyrics seem child like even diaristic, but give the girl a break, she's 22 and finind her voice. There hasn't been a CD with this much vivaciousness, energy, attitude and cool since the like of No Doubts "" Tragic Kingdom, Cyndi Laupers ""She's so Unusual"" or Pat Benatars ""Crimes of Passion""Get This CD and You won't be disappointed."
4,Great Album!,"I have Pink's first album and I love it. I bought this one and I love it also. I have no problem with her changing herself. I absolutley adore ""Don't let me get me"". It's my favorite song in the whole collection. ""Just like a pill"" is something I can relate to also. I have to say that I am amazed at the venom and meaness people display when they are reveiwing stuff they don't like. This album included. Lighten up. It's only music!!!!"
3,So much better than her last album . . .,"Wow! This CD really impressed me at first. Pink has gone from an uninteresting, ordinary pop star to having her own style. The album is mostly rock, mixed with some pop. My favorite tracks include Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like A Pill, 18 Wheeler, My Vietnam, and Misery. The only thing is, this album is just so damn depressing (w/the exception of Get The Party Started). In Family Portrait, Pink just spills out her heart a little too much. Some of the lyrics are actually quite funny, even if they're not supposed to be. As she's begging her father to stay with her family, she screams, ""I DON'T WANT MOM TO HAVE TO CHANGE HER LAST NAME!"" and then she pleads, ""I won't spill the milk at dinner."" C'mon, you have to chuckle. In 18 Wheeler she actually fights back against her man who is ""pushing her down"". But come on, there's only so many times you can listen to this album without an, ""Oh, please."""
5,No longer Missundaztood,"Edgy and defiant, Pink's new CD is a trip back to the days of Janis Joplin. Her songwriting is unique, backed up by her superb vocals. This is not just another studio singer. While ""Get This Party Started"" provided her the fast track to the top of the charts, the remaining songs on this CD won't disappoint."
4,THis was an OK Cd,"This CD's first 6 songs were really good, but it just went downhill after that. Missundaztood, Don't Let Me Get Me, Get the Party Started, and 18 Wheeler were definetly the best. The ones at the end are all very slow and boring and are not worth the money. But the beginning certainly is!"
4,Think PINK,"this albim really surprised me. I expected the useal stuff about her boyfriend dumping her or she was in love. but i took a gamble and bought it anyway.to my surprize she can really do it up. a mixture of blues and pop and alt. rock make this a breakout album for her.I like the fact that PINK trusts her voice to go through all the different ranges in these songs. It takes a real singer to do a album like this and if people are comparing her to britney spears she need not worry anymore. I dont think brit has the vocal range to cover an album like this, nor would she ever take the chance. go PINK! highly reccommened."
3,Good Cd,"This second album has Pink do a 360 from her last album to a pop rock album as opposed to her ""There You Go"" , ""Most Girls"" , ""You Make Me Sick"" album, now here she is singing stronger tunes about her life and people around her that she just doesnt wanna deal with. This is a great cd to listen to when you are mad at someone or do not wanna deal with problems especially when you are angry. ""Like A Pill"", ""Get The Party Started"" , ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" , and ""Family Portrait"" are some of the highlights on this album. The DVD is fun too, it has live performances which surprised me becasue i did not know she could sing that well and two bonus videos. I admit in my ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" video loses part of the sound near the beggining of the song as if the sound drops. Other than that this is a great buy for your money. The DVD alone is also sold if you already have the album, as a DVD single."
5,you're insides will be swimmin' in somethin' yummy,"You've had those CDs where you jam to one song, then skip, then skip, then ""oh yah, #6 is a good song"" - jam to that - then skip, then skip, ""oh and 11 too - that's good"". You realize you paid ...for 3 songs! Then you feel like a sucker. THIS CD IS NOT ONE OF THOSE! Every song in Missundaztood is delictable and unique and is infused with influences from all types of musical genres. Lyrics are raw but not over poetic and smarmy. If you could wearout a CD from playing it over and over again, you'd wearout this one and buy another one and feel great about it!"
1,st!nk,Same old manufactured pop puppet. You have an okay voice but the rest (everything really) sucks. This whole macho butch-les attitude you have isn't cute neither. I could whoop you with my thumb!
1,Warning Not For RnB Fans,"Pink has gone the wrong way, just when everyone was getting used to a great white female RnB artist, all of a sudden she has tuned into some (if its your cup of tea) Rock/Pop girl. I guess its the lack of Babyface that might of caused this disruption, Pink why the F**k did you change!!"
1,another Weak Album,I don't really see much talent in Pink as a Artist.now She went for a Different Pop take here but Her voice really doesn't have much Range.Overall this is Standard Pop Material but given Coded Words.alot of the Material is pretty Much Derivative of what Happen in the past couple of years.it's cool to Bite over time but not where it's like last week?She will Be Lost in the Gwyenn Stefani Clone Era.
4,A Decent CD - good music - not great,"Missundaztood -Liked it a lot, a little cheesy 3/5Don't Let Me Get Me - Great Song. Pretty good lyrics 3/5Just Like A Pill - Best SOng on the Album, greeat lyrics 5/5Get the Party Started - Great dance song 4/5Respect - Great song. Great dance song also. 4/518 Wheeler - TERRIBLE!...The lyrics and beat are terrible 1/5Family Portrait - Okay song, kinda boring 2/5Misery - Like this song, 3/5Dear Diary - Liek Britney Spears' version better 2/5Eventually - Alright, not bad to listen to with friends 3.1/5Lonely Girl - Good song, decent voculs, 3.5/5Numb - Good beat bad lyrics 1.5/5Going to California - Great song, kinda uplifting 4.1/5My Vietnam - Decent 2.7/10"
1,the faded color pink,"Pink (more so than Brittney) is the utmost example of the pupetteer business of having a record deal. Pink has a good voice, but the ""no one likes me, no one understands me"" act is irritating and tiring. She tries so hard to be different, that it comes off as a pure ACT. Wasn't she R&B before? Don't tell me she's another Mariah coming out of her ""True"" shell.She name-drops too much, but I give her credit for effort in writing lyrics that TRY to be controversial. If one is indeed so original and controversial, she wouldn't have to try so hard, and it would show!"
1,Disappointed...,"I couldn't have been more disappointed. Here's a classic case of there only being ONE good song on the entire CD, ""Get the Party Started"" which was released first. I wish I would have bought the single instead. Don't get me wrong... I LOVED her first CD. I played it to death! I was holding my breath for her second CD. I've used 'Missundaztood' as a drink coaster instead."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"I love all the songs on Pink's CD. They ROCK! My favorite is 18 Wheeler, because it's a great song AND my dad drives an 18 Wheeler (not to run over people, though!).I kinda lied when I said I liked ALL the songs. The one song I don't like is ""Eventually"". It gets on my nerves.I hope you found my review helpful!"
3,"R&B TO PUNK!? WTF!!! No More P!INK, More Like Alicia.","P!INK really let most of the depressing fans down when she went with Punk music. She was really R&B & Hip-Hop and thats what I liked about her. P!NK seemed more like a R&B name not PUNK more like Alicia. I really don't love this album as much as ""Take Me Home"" ""Missundaztood"" should have been ""Missunderstood"" I really don't think she should relase another album as far from here. My favorite tracks on this album are ""Get The Party Started"" and ""Just Like A Pill"" also ""Dear Diary"" those are the only songs and some chorsus on some songs. Really if you like the first album you won't like this one!!!"
2,Worst analogies ever!,To be fair there are some very good songs on the CD - about 4 or 5 in my opinion. Not nearly as good as the first album.But the rest are hard to tolerate. The lyrics are childish and worse - hard to block out while still listening to the music. I find myself skipping to the middle of the CD and stopping it before the end.I should have downloaded the songs and deleted the ones I don't appreciate...
4,P!nk...,"this cd is cool and pink seems to have a gift to write cool lyrics, her voice is cool and strong. my favourites songs on the album are: ""Eventually"", ""Misery"" which is a duet with steven tyler,""Numb"",""M!ssundaztood"", ""Just like a pill"", and ""Respect"".this is a cool cd and you should buy it..."
2,This Album Made Me Red,"I don't understand the hype surrounding Pink. Her first album was wwwaaayyy better than this mess she calls,""Missundaztood"". The only songs I like are:Get The Party Started18 WheelerMissundastoodBut the rest of the album bored me to tears. But lets give credit where credit is due, at least her ""punkness"" is more real than Avril."
5,This is music,"If u like the Pink from ""Can't take Me home"", you'll get a little shocked when heard this. This CD represent another whole level in the music of Pink, 'cause now she sings with honesty, honesty that bleeds on this disc. The songs are very personal and mean something... ""Lonely Girl"", my favorite song on the album, her voice sounds strong and sad at the same time, just like in ""Family Portrait"" u can feel the pain on her voice... the first single ""GTPS"" don't represent the feeling of the whole CD, but don't think that the music on this disc it's depressing... songs like ""Respect"", ""18 Wheeler"", ""Missundaztood"" and ""Numb"" are really great with a lot of heavy bits and awesome guitars... the CD it's worth the money, honestly, buy it and feel the new side of P!nk and her music... u'll see her in a different way... after listening this CD."
3,Good but not very,"I like this woman. Her videos are very nice too. I was kind of dissappointed because only 3 songs are worth the album but they are GREAT songs: Just like a pill, Don't let me get me and Get the party started"
4,autobiographical,"Pink's new cd is really doing great....going triple platinum after only 2 singles so far....the singles are great which relly help the cd, but her autobiographical disc..her music reflects whatever u can relate to...my favorite track on the disc is 'JUST LIKE A PILL' AND '18 WHEELER'.Hearfelt music that is sure to reach the masses!"

4,A kick-bootay mix of music,"Great CD. Blues, alt rock, classic rock, R&B, hip-hop, pop, and just a touch of jazz all in one. Great lyrics. A particularly good one is ""Misery"" with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler lending his always-cool raspy voice for backup vocals, and let's give a hand to Bon Jovi's Richie Sambora for the guitar solo. ""Respect"" gives a great outlook on male-female interaction, and ""Get the Party Started"" is an instant hit. It's definitely worth your money."
4,Highly Recommended,"This album was great, it showed a fresh & more independant side of Pink. I like how she kinda broke away from that so-called pop-princess image people say she portrayed. This album shows ""the edge"" side of Pink we all enjoy. Check out the duet with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, it rocks."
5,Very good follow-up!!!,I've always liked Pink's style. This abum is very exciting and raunchy and she still has a great voice. I definitely recommend this album!
5,pink rocks,"This album is fantastic, there isn't one song on it that I don't like. I'm a very big fan of pink and have been for ages, it was the song Family Portrait that got me interested in her, I loved it the first time I heard it. This is by far one of the best albums I've ever brought and listened to. ""IT'S QUALITY"""
3,Missunderstood,1. M!ssundaztood 3/52. Don't Let Me Get Me 4/53. Just Like A Pill 5/54. Get The Party Started 3/55. Respect 1/56. 18 Wheeler 2/57. Family Portrait 1/58. Misery (w/Steven Tyler) 2/59. Dear Diary 4/510. Eventually 2/511. Lonely Girl (w/Linda Perry) 3/512. Numb 2/513. Gone To California 1/514. My Vietnam 5/515.Catch 22 ( I got the import version ) 5/5
4,I love almost every song on here!,"When I got this album I was in love with it and after a year I find that there are songs on here that I would consider some of my most favorite songs ever.This album does have it's bad spots, Family Portrate (horrible single choice) being one of them. But I feel that the great songs stand out more then those. 18 Wheeler is by far the best track on this album, it's a powerful angry song that just makes you wanna be stronger, Numb is also good, Just Like A Pill, Get The Party Started, Don't Let Me Get Me, and the tital track are all brilliant songs. I reccomend it."
1,Bad choice of music,"Let me be honest with you. The music on this CD is NOT good. NONE of the music nowadays is good. The songs on here don't have interesting melodies. Songs of genres like rap don't even have melodies. And in all other genres of new music (e.g. pop, R&B, rock) the melodies of the songs are either boring or ugly. If a song that is popular these days has a catchy melody, it's a catchy UGLY melody. Melodies have to be nice to be enjoyable, like in classical music. Here is a simple rule: For music to be good, it has to first of all HAVE a melody, and second the melody has to be catchy and NICE (NOT UGLY)!"
1,Pink Who?,"This album was horrible. I wish that I had never bought it for my sister. When we first put it in to listen in her car we made it through the first two songs and out the window it went. If you were driving down Highway 101 and accidently got hit with the worst album ever created we're sorry you had to be in it's presence. She has to be not only the worse performer of all time, but one of the worse ""pop"" singers of all time. When it comes to vocal talent I'd give Pink a 3 out of 10. When it comes to knowledge of music she get's a 0 out of 10. When it comes to physical beauty, well we can all agree she looks like a man. When it comes to pop music, she doesn't know what it means. She needs to learn that she isn't accepted by any facit of the music community. Her 15 minutes are up!"
2,Just Plain Irritating,"When will artists realize that ""Nobody understands my pain. Nobody likes me. I am so misunderstood and unapreciated"" is not a good act to try to make a career out of. Pink is just trying to sell the rebel rocker thing too hard here. The only song I like is ""Just Like a Pill,"" and don't ask me why I even like that. Her first CD was so much better."
2,"Get yourself a gun,hun!!",This album is a serious let down on what i was expecting. Maybe my expectations were too high but apart from 'get the party started' this material just gives me the impression that Pink is heading for a very expensive rehab clinic very soon. No mention of Robbie Williams here but at least he did it with style. Pink goes from on track to the next with new miseries in each new track. The only praise i would give her is the touching track 'my vietnam' which reflects how her personal war relates to the one her late father fought in. Her first album was a massive hit with me but i think her change from RnB to Pop will only benefit her financial as i will think twice before buying her next material.
1,Black and blue all over...,"I liked the first Pink album. I think she's a beautiful person with a very strong attitude. I enjoyed the first single off this album and the video. I bought this CD and [didn't like it]. The lyrics are absolutely mind numbing to where i was embarassed listening to it, AND I'M NOT EVEN FEATURED ON IT! This is an embarassment to Pink. This isn't rock, or pop, or anything other than bulltripe on wax. I would rather listen to a Slipknot remix of Britney Spears' ""Slave 4 U"" than listen to this... from beginning to end. The beats are wack. The lyrics are wack (and we wondered why Four Non-Blondes didn't last long), and the whole vibe is wack. If she hopes to heal after the cut this is gonna make she'd better call in Timbaland, Missy, JD, Swizz Beats, and The Neptunes for the next album. As much as I hate all of those people it's the only way she'll survive..."
3,it will Cuss,THisa album cusses and I only like one song lets get this party started.Oh and ferrasan this is the internet you con't just go around typing the D word every where!!!!!!
4,Finally understood,"Her first album was more or less soul and quite dull soul, now she's got into more pop-rock and made the album more personal too and she's improving. Most of the songs are allright including her big hit ""Get the party started"" and ""Don't let me get me"" ""Just like a pill"" she's reminds me of Madonna in the 80's when she had a tougher attidute and was a like a rebel. ""Family portrait"" her newest single is about her childhood, haven't many others been singing about that lately? There are some more ballads, but most songs are up-tempo pop songs. Many songs are personal but she makes them interesting with a catchy hook and some good lyrics (mostly) She's been writting most songs by herself actually. I give her 4 cause i think she's improved as a artist and received mega status, hopefully she'll make a good next album too."
5,good glick,"Love pink and this is another one to add to my pink collection, amazon makes it so ez to shop for stuff you like and quickly, built up my pink collection in one shopping trip, for around twenty bucks very pleased with purchase and amazon."
2,This album is missundaztood!,"Ok there are only a few songs that are good on this album. I don't even know what style of music this is. P!nk could have done better than this. ""Dear Diary, Numb, Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like A Pill"" are the only good songs. And most of the songs have bad words in it. This cd is really missundaztood. I'm glad that she changed her style of music. This is like rap, pop and something else that I'm not getting the point of. A lot of P!nks albums and songs are good, but this one is not all there."
3,"""I've got a guardian angel tattooed on my shoulder...""","Missundaztood from Pink is a raw and colorful array of pop and rock hits. Standout tracks include: Missundaztood, Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like a Pill, Get the Party Started, Family Portrait, Dear Diary, and Lonely Girl. Pink's first album, Can't Take Me Home didn't show Pink's range as a singer and songwriter, but with this album Pink was finally given freedom to express what she wanted and needed to say thanks in part to friend and mentor Linda Perry. Some of the rest of the tracks are ok, nothing spectacular but it's an album you can relate to and have fun with as well, very tongue-in-cheek."
4,Really Good!!!!,"I am not really a Pink fan but I must say that this cd is impressive! I decided to buy after I heard the single Don't Let Me Get Me which is in my opinion the best on the album. The song is like my life story and I could relate to it so much I just knew I had to buy it! I was surprised to see that the rest was very good too. I love other songs like Just Like A Pill, Get This Party Started, 18 Wheeler, Family Portrait, Misery, and Lonley Girl."
5,PINK CD,"love her music, just cant get enough of it, put it on cleaning, cooking etc. I got to have them all!"
4,Always enjoy her,I always enjoy Pink's music. She has developed as an artist on many levels and personally grown as a person and it shown in her music.
3,3 steps back.,"P!NK as she decided to be known on this album took her RnB style and chucked it out the window. WHY OH WHY!!!! POP ROCK was now her game - cleaverly pre-empting the angst ridden trash that filled MTV to bursting today, yet never squarley fixing a definitive style (shame). A great talent was evident in her debut album & sadly her third (most recent) work appears to display a spirling career towards the bargin bin of your local wal-mart before long."
2,Hip Hop Diva or Rocker Chick??,So is Pink rap or rock? It's curious how she all of a sudden changed her image from hip hop diva to rocker chick with an attitude when girls like Gwen Stephani were starting to become all the rage in pop music. Please no more manufactured pop stars!!!
1,Just awful...eewwwwwwww,"Please don't buy this CD...first off, it is very very ANNOYING! The beats are annoying, the singer is annoying, just everything about this is annoying! First off she complains about everything! Secondly she NEVER will be Britney Spears or Christina! And neither Britney or Christina aren't that good so why would she want to be one of them? Just a bit of advice save your money unless if you like to waste money on garbage! I'd give it no stars if I could..."
3,WHY,"&#65279;PINK""POTTY MOUTH!""I REALLY LOVE PINK. AND I LOVE HER STYLE, BUT WHY WOULD SHE RECORDSONGS WITH WORDS THAT ARE JUST PLAIN RUDE. I'M EMBARRASSED TO LISTENTO THIS CD WHEN MY PARENTS OR RELATIVES ARE NEAR BECAUSE IT IS NOTAPPROPRIATE. I THINK THAT THIS CD SHOULD BE LABELED WITH THE EXPLICITCONTENT STICKER, BECAUSE HEY! IT IS.THEY DO KIND OF WORK THEIR MAGIC AND EDIT SOME OF THE WORDS OUT BUTIT IS STILL IMPLIED ANY STILL NOT NICE, I CAN'T IMAGINE SOME OF PINKSYOUNGER FANS FROM CANT TAKE ME HOME LISTENING TO THIS. HOWEVER IDO REALLY LIKE THE SONGS ON IT AND GIVES PINK A NEW LOOK.MY FAVORITE SONGS:1. FAMILY PORTRAIT.2. GET THE PARTY STARTED.I'M VERY DISPLEASED WITH PINKS NEW BAD WORDS IN THIS CD. ALSO I THINKTHAT PINK REALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE HER LAST CD (ALTHOUGH IT DID HAVE SOME MILD LANGUAGE) DID NOT DEPEND ON THIS KINDOF BAD MOUTHING GARBAGE TO SELL."
1,"""Missundaztood""?","What the hell? Does she not know to spell correctly or is this her way of being 'smooth'? All I can say, Pink tries too hard. Reminds me of Avril. Learn how to spell, THEN write your own lyrics."
1,"Actually, let's not get the party started just yet","Well, I can't see what people like about this cd really. It sounds like some wanna be ghetto girl acting cool. What do people see in rediculous lyrics and stupid radio songs like ""Get this party started?"" There is absolutely no depth to these songs at all. Some variation would have been nice. There is nothing to be mizunderstood about my review: this cd is pointless and irritating. Pink is on her way to Tiffanyland, if you catch my drift."
1,the only good song is get the party started,the only reason i got this album was for get the party startedyou can't help but like that song..i thought their would be at least one other song that was as goodboy was I wrong....pink is just whiny and irritating on this albumand if you like get the party started just download it or listen to the radio ive heard it 10 million times I swear
1,Hey [...] cant i give this 0 stars?,Thats what Pink and this album deserve. Hey Pink werent you that R&B girl a while back? I didnt know that you were a Punk rocker Pink? Oh maybe thats because you're a poser. She gets into the music industry as an R&B girl so she gets fame that way and then turns around and expects people to believe you're punk the next album. Sorry Pink but REAL punk rockers dont sell their soul to record labels. They make music on their OWN terms and have no apologies for it. Dont buy this album and save your money for the new Joey Ramone album. You'll be glad you did.
3,Sophmore Slump?,"I loved Pink's debut and could wait for her mext album. Even though I loved ""Get The Party Started"" that is the only song like that on the album. While ""Missundaztood"" has some good songs. A lot of people who liked her first album may not feel this one. It's not R&B at all. It's mostly has a rocl feel to it."
4,A Whole New Pink!,"I have to say I did not like Pinks debut album. She came off as a bitter version of Destinys Child so I was hesitant to buy this album. I loved it! Pink has gone into a completely different direction and has mixed all kinds of music. Pop, Jazz, Rock, Alternative, and Disco to create one of the most diverse albums this year. Pink sounds terrific and proves she can sing any type of music. The vocals and lyrics come from her heart which was missing from her latest album. The album has a few depressing songs but for the most part an amazing album from who I thought would be just another pop/r&b diva releasing songs that all sound the same. Pink deserves alot of credit for going in a completely different direction."
5,great album!,this is the 1st pink album i bought and i love it! the beats are hot and the lyrics are great!
4,Execellent! Variety of Great Tracks,"Hoping Pink would continue her strong reign in the music world with her second albume, so is not to be missundaztood anymore as these tracks ROCK!A wide variety of tracks from pop, dance, rap to jazz. This is going straight to the top and I can foresee at least 4-5 top 10 hits off the track - easy.Way to go Pinky......."
4,*~ TAke a deeper listen into Pink's Life and Feelings*~,"In all hoensty when I first lsitened to this CD I was disapointed. I was like this is NOTHING like ""Can't Take Me Home."" But then I took a deeper listen.This cd is full of how Pink REALLY feels and how she feels about the world. And the best part? They are are real feelings because she wrote most of the songs~ Some of the outstanding songs were Don't Let me Get Me, Get the Party Started, Misery, and Lonely Girl. Respect wasnt bad either.All teh songs ahve ther own funkiness to them. Pink is awesome~ Im proud of her new CD~ She took the chance of being different and for all of you who said you hated this cd. Thats ok.. she took teh chance of being difefrent. Some will respect her for it and others will go their own way w/ their opinions.I love this cd and new side of Pink. Shes a lot more sensitive than I thought and shes normal. Just bacause shes a star she still shows that she is a person with real feelings~GO PINK!"
2,Not that Great,"ok so I liked a few songs but I wouldn't say the whole cd is worth it... I heard from a friend it was really good and I took her word for it. I shouldn't have because I only like 3 or 4 songs on this cd the rest of it is just painful to listen to thats why this cd gets 2 stars. Sorry Pink, I expected better."
4,fun & inspirational,"enjoyed this board, the simplicity of use and the artwork, etc. however, two things are faulted, in my opinion. the crystal dice are beautiful, but hard to see the dots and the board should have come with cards, although you can purchase Ms. Virtue's angel cards separately, which i have done. another form of divination that allows instant, direct answers. using cards with the board helps with deeper interpretation of the answers, otherwise the ""guiding"" answers can be generic & shallow."
3,Disappointing !,"I have got a lot books and oracles cards decks by Doreen Virtue and they are brilliant !Being a fan of Doreen,I was expecting more from her, and after reading one of her latest books, I'm wondering whether Doreen has become far too successful or not...The board is indeed beautiful but it's too expensive for what it's worth as it's more confusing than anything else. you only get general answers...it's quite disappointing... I stick to the oracle sets, they are much better.25th March 2007 : since I wrote the review, I got used to the board...I like it more than before, but it is because I have developped my intuition (thank you Mr John Holland! I very strongly recommend his books and audio-books!)...Having said that, I still think that this board is not worth its price :get a second-hand one if you can."
2,Very Disappointing!,"First, let me say that every book and card deck that I have from Doreen, I've always loved and recommend to all. I was very anxious to receive this new board of hers. She said she created it because she found other boards confusing to use. I actually found this more confusing. It's set up for you to ask your question under a category the questions falls under. So if your question covers two separate categories, you roll the dice twice for each category and move to the box for the answer. Than with the book that comes with it, look the answer up for a more in-depth answer. That takes to long and I rather pull out my cards. Unfortunately, I ended up returning this board."
2,Not a good divination tool,"I tried this board out after getting it from ebay and I have to say that it didn't give me good specific answers. Also some questions I asked it gave me conflicting answers. It didn't really feel like a divination tool at all, it felt more like you were playing a game. I have better luck with automatic writing, oracle cards, and the pendulum. I will be selling this."
1,Never received item and it was close to $20.00!!!,I never received this much wanted item. I reached out to the seller and never received a reply. The item was close to $20.00.
5,"Grace Kelly,Lovely Book","I did not buy this book on Amazon,but from a Library sale when I was 15,lol.I became such a huge fan of hers after I read it,at first,I did not know she was an actress,and I thought this was a fictional story! I couldn't believe this was real,marrying a Prince and you're from Philly(albeit,High Society Philidelphia,no pun intended,lol)It is a fantastic book,very fair,wonderful insights and facts.He told the complete story,and even some tidbits most Kelly fans weren't aware of.I only wish there were more pictures of this beautiful sensational woman,I still can't get enough of!"
5,Bam! It opens your heart right up,"""My mother may have died with dreams she never fulfilled, but this daughter is insistent that the same won't happen to me. Death, I cannot control, but personal action I can.""Such determination and insight from such a young woman who grew up in a life of privilege who might choose to be bitter but instead turns it around or ""pays it forward"" so others might gain her insight is something I found remarkable in this author.Even in her seemingly jarring views of escape from the family she created, there is hope. The highlight of the book, in my opinion is the short story ""Peaches and Nectarines.""""I am furious with marriage for the way it buries love in the sludge of who takes out the trash; the way routine replaces romance. Allen smiles at me over our sleeping daughter's head and in that crystal of time I see only the courage and kindness our marriage has brought out, not the cost, and I discover that marriage gives us the chance to be heroes."""
4,Not just the next best ghoststory,"Another horror-movie? Why, we've seen a million of these and they're basicly all the same, concentrating on confusing and grotesque death-scenes and a plot that reeks to hell with none of the important questions answered.Not this one, I assure you.The Nesting has some death-scenes (ofcourse, it's still a horror-flick) but they're gripping and intense. The plot is confusing from time to time, leaving the viewer wondering and aching to discover the truth. In the end you get it all, the whole thing, and everything falls into place.Although some of the actors don't really seem to do their best with their characters, leaving them flat and hollow, the star of this movie (Robin Groves) really goes for the kill (figure of speech). She's great!For me, this one goes to the shelf of classic golden-oldies. See it, and you've seen one of the best ghost-stories since the coming of film."
2,"Another day, another dollar, another haunted house story","And not a very good at that. At least not in the traditional sense. The acting is all right, and the story is okay, but I figured out the ending rather quickly, and I just didn't find it very scary, to tell you the truth. But it's supposed to be a cult favorite, so I suppose all horror film enthusiasts should watch it. Horror, like the man said, is in the eye of the beholder."
5,Many expressions of an ideal,"Local Deities touched me deeply. I am about the same age as the children in the book, and the passages which describe the Bohemian left-wing life of the early 1970s evoke glimpses of my childhood--to the extent of conjuring even smells (e.g., baking bread and homemade yogurt) and sounds (e.g., listening from bed as adults arguing politics late into the night) from that period.The book uses multiple perspectives to capture different conceptions and practices of left-wing idealism and gave me wonderful perspective on the political and personal choices that my parents and their friends have made. The characters are vividly drawn, and their dilemmas and internal conversations are poignant and seem real.If you enjoyed E.L. Doctorow's The Book of Daniel, T.C. Boyle's World's End, or John Sayle's Union Dues then you are very likely to enjoy Local Deities."
2,Accomodation info already out of date,"Although this edition was only published 2 years ago, the accomodation sections in various towns is already quite out of date . I suppose the accomodation situation changes quite rapidly in Hungary, even the 2005 edition of LP Eastern Europe has much more up to date accomodation info for Hungary, altough as a whole it has less info on Hungary of course."
4,good travel book,"I spent the whole time in Budapest. This book covered all the information I needed for just that city alone. I figure I have the whole book for one I go back with more time to venture to the rest of the country. It's a Lonely Planet book, it delivers the same quality. I would have liked a few more pictures in the book."
5,great piano book,this is one of the best books ever written for teaching little fingers to play piano this series has been around for a long time and have had great experiences with it if you want to teach your little one to play i suggest this series
2,"Edited by Lorrie Moore, not By Lorrie Moore","At a glance, you might think this is a collection of stories by Lorrie Moore, but beware, it is not. This is a collection of wildly differing and unrelated stories on the topic of childhood. While I love Lorrie Moore's work, both short fiction and novels, none of the authors included appeal to me the way she does. ( Not one story compares favorably to Moore's near- masterpiece "" People Like That Are the Only People Here"" ) But, if you are looking specifically for a book of short stories by contemporary authors on the general topic of childhood, this might appeal to you."
5,Good Product,"This is exactly the product I wanted. I use it for powering my computer and my wife's computer at the pool during the summer. If using this product often, I would suggest a cable organizer as with 100' it gets tangled fairly easily. I am using a piece of plywood currently to keep it organized.I would recommend this product."
3,not bad,"I bought this to quilt my first quilt which happened to be a queen size. I didn't realize how over my head this project was. I wasn't going to splurge on a $200 hoop, but I should have. This hoop is definitely worth the price. I can make due, but I have to readjust often. If I was quilting a lighter in weight project, I would have absolutely no problem. I am still happy with the purchase, and I'm still shopping for a sturdier hoop."
5,An Outstanding Experience!,"""An outstanding experience. The whole recording has such a cultural impact that it could easisly be considered a fundamental step in lute music interpretation. A splendid work that will have an excellent reception"". (Giorgio Ferraris, Il Fronimo, Italy)"
1,useless ...,"BEWARE: this issue does NOT include the libretto. Not even the slightest hint about where to find a libretto. Useless for me, no matter how great a performance and how magnificent the recording."
5,Best experience i had,"I only want to tell, that Tech for Less are the best company experience i had in Amazon. They refund the price payed and i keep the item. Thats because i tried to cancel it when was shipped and Tech for Less give me that priority. Thank you Tech, and will be doing business later. Sorry, i forgot to tell, the product are in perfect conditions, brand new factory sealed and works grate."
2,Run very small,I thought perhaps time on the shoe stretcher and leather softening liquid would work on these so I didn't send them back. My efforts at alteration did not work. I have had Propet shoes that did fit - must have been a different last. My foot is short and wide. I bought it in a 6 extra wide. Maybe they will be all right for people who have trouble finding shoes that are narrow enough.
2,Be careful - I got the Mens Shoe instead,When I ordered this I thought I was ordering the black womens sneaker - however when it arrived it was the mens shoe - be careful to double check and make sure it is the womens shoe. I have the shoe in white and love it - very comfortable
3,Ouch!,The shoe ran true to size for me and the cushioning aspects were okay. My first wear resulted in a sore heel. I'm hoping the stiffness of the back ridge of the shoe will soften once I wash them.
3,Pretty shoes but disappointed.,"I usually buy the ""life walker"" of the same brand, but these were slightly cheaper and I liked the color so thought ""might as well."" These are just not as good supporting shoes as the prior mentioned. My feet hurt in them after short time. I could stand in the others for hours. I have better shoes I have purchased at a thrift store that support my feet in a nicer manner.they are shiny and fancy looking though. Dressy enough to wear with a skirt. I have not worn them enough to wash them, so cannot comment on that part of the deal. perhaps that is what make them so much worse than the other style of shoe."
3,"Nice shoe, but very narrow.",The previous reviews alluded to the narrowness. I'm glad I paid attention because I ordered wider than my normal size. I could have gone even wider although my shoe is okay with thin socks. I don't understand why a manufacturer would make a shoe so much narrower than others.
4,Comfortable,Super flexible and comfortable. They feel supportive without being heavy or stiff. The laces stay tied without double knotting. I haven't washed them yet. I will buy them again when I need new work shoes!
2,Useful but flawed,"I have used Susan Rappaport's book of the same title for many years, along with the Art Lover's Travel Guide because that book included more web addresses, more american musuems, and had a point of view-which saves me from visiting the second rate. I do not mind buying two books each year. But....I plan my trips around art shows, and just xerox pages to take with me. That is very difficult to do because this book is so slender-perhaps they were thinking we would put it in our pocket? Since it covers international as well as american museums, it is unlikely we would do so.I resent this guy using virtually the same title as I have bought from Susan Rappaport before, and short changing the pages. Since I work in the travel industry I have used thousands of guide books. This is not one I will buy again unless they make it a reasonable reading size. Susan, where the heck are you?"
4,Team Effort,"The help of my 6 and 8 year old grandchildren was required to put this track together. They were able to show me how to make this work. Assembly assisted with my ""bonding"" efforts a lot. I'm sure that I could not have put this track together without their engineering skills. I should have ordered more track and several variations and will do so after Christmas. Maybe then the grandkids will let me play with the train."
3,Does not replace the full service manual,"I have both this book and volkswagen's service manual. If you do regular, simple maintance only, this book will suffice. If you change timing belts, serpentine/accessory belts, or more advanced work ... it will not be enough. You should buy the service manual as well. However, notice that I said ""as well"". It is far easier to find information quickly with the Haynes book than the service manual. But, if you need detailed drawings and explanations on how to do something, you will need the service manual. So, I use both in my garage.Should you buy Haynes or Chilton. I'm not sure who copies who, but they are pretty much the same. Buy which ever is cheapest."
3,Repair manual,I ordered this repair manual and received it quick before the date was given for delivery. The manual was confusing to me but eventually I was able to understand it the more I read it. It did help with some of the issues I needed but one that would tell you part numbers to order would have been better. But all in all I did use it and will give it to the new owner when I sell the car. Thanks.
4,I'll always vote for Haynes over Chilton.,"Every car I own or will buy, I'll get a Haynes. I'm a female who does my own work and this is the book that can walk me through just about anything. In this economy I need to save every dime. So save some cash and try it yourself- this is the book."
5,Great bargain at Amazon,I just love Amazon. I am a college student and I buy cheap books for children to encourage them to become avid readers and honor students.
3,Learning Letters..5 senses,"Not quite what I expected or wanted. It is still a good help for preschool, just not as great as I hoped."
2,Not very good,"This book is focused on a character who is stupid, vain, inept and duped. His only skill is that he knows how to lie. Not much fun to read, one dimensional plot, the English is correct,understandable, but that doesn't leave the reader with much at all. I would not recommend this book. Maybe I misunderstood? Was it supposed to be funny? When people compare an author to LeCarre, I don't expect comedy."
2,Needs a big shovel to dig out of his hole...,"I wanted to like this book, really I did, because certain reviews had mentioned a similarity with books by Le Carré which I enjoy. But unfortunately, I found it tedious and just plain boring. There's no need to repeat the general plot as others have already done so. And, while I respect others' opinions, I must take issue with those who have referred to this as a mystery. Unless you've never read a spy book before, there's only one way this story was going, (Spoiler Alert) except perhaps for the death of the girl. A giant billboard couldn't have given it away any more clearly!I may give another of his books a try because, as I said, I really wanted to like this author but he's got a big hole to dig out of. Sorry..."
2,Just could not pick it up once I put it down,"By far the most difficult to enjoy of any Cummings novel I've read to date. It plods, it is a slog, it bogs. It isn't all bad, of course, and probably somewhere on a train or plane if I run out of other things to read, I will for the fourth or fifth time try and get past the first third of this one."
2,Boring,"Mildly interesting description of a British spy's early screening and training, but otherwise boring. There never seems to be any action that a good spy novel must have. I'll skip future books by cumming."
1,Not my cup of tea,"NOTHING HAPPENS.I'm 65% through, and must force myself to keep reading, hoping something will finally happen at the end."
2,"Boxed in, for Carre lovers","Sadly, this well observed, well written, not quite a spy novel lacks a satisfactory motive, and suffers from low plot pressure. The story of a would-be spy and second class everything, the driving point of this novel revolves around a broken love affair. This should be called a ""novel of dissimulation"" instead of a spy novel, but that category doesn't sell very well. Very much in the Le Carre tradition of ""ordinary men doing ordinary things and calling it adventure"" the author can't decide whether his character is an antihero, or just a failure. Probably both. There is actually some excellent writing, and wonderful observations of ""the games people play"", but not enough to redeem the book. Will try the author's next novel to see if he improves."
2,I second reviewer newyork2dallas.,"newyork2dallas lays out the story and the character of it protagonist better than I ever could.Alec Milius At the age of 24 was talent-spotted by M16 in London and placed inside a British oil company with the purpose of befriending two employees of a rival American firm and selling them doctored research data on an oilfield in the Caspian Sea. The two employees turns out were CIA. After botching the job, by unbelievably stupid lame behavior. End of story. He goes on the run... Next book two ""The Spanish Game"". Not good either."
1,Do people seriously like this?!,"I picked up this novel, excited to read, was I in for a disappointment. I am an avid reader of spy novels and this just didn't click for me. It was boring at the beginning, middle, and end and in my opinion to real plot. In fact I'm surprised this book was ever published! Sorry Charles Cumming I'm never reading one of your books again."
3,Only ok,"I agree the begining of the book was interesting about the testing procedure to get into MI6. But I was expecting more action. I found I really didn't care about Alec's past relationship and way to much time was spent on this. I also did not get a feeling of suspense and the end seemed rushed. I like the Author's writting style, but was not crazy about the story."
2,"Too slow, narrator too self-absorbed","I was recommended this book by a friend. I am sad to say it is one of the very few books that I was unable to finish in my life. About a third of the way in, I felt like I was wasting my time. There was no action, no spying, no suspense of any sort: just self-absorbed drivel up to that point. Characters and events hinted at, but poorly. Perhaps the book gets better, but you know what, I am 41 and I was once told to subtract your age from 100 and if a book doesn't grab you by that number's page, move on. So I did.I will say that I have a very low tolerance for the anti-hero. This book's narrator is definitely an anti-hero. If this doesn't bother you, you may like this book."
3,Trying to Re-invent the post cold war spy novel,"Give Charles Cummings credit for having the courage to try to put a new spin on post Cold War spy fiction. His protagonist, Alec Milius, is unlikeable from beginning to end. Selfish, short-sighted, and in over his head, Milius isn't even interesting. But, perhaps that's the point. Ideology means nothing. Character doesn't matter. Cash--in this case oil--is what everything is about. Spying--so Cummings seems to be saying--is as bland as Milius and utterly lacking significance."
2,Disappointing,"This was the first book I bought for the Kindle and I was surprised by the typos. Li = H, surely that is easy to fix. I was disappointed in the story....was too long winded in parts and somewhat confusing too. Not a fan"
1,Poor Filming...Great Songs,"I have seen Billy live many times and am a very big fan. Having said this, I cannot watch this. The bouncing, moving, pulsating, convulsive, (do I need to use more adjectives?) film is enough to throw anyone into a seizure. Do yourself a favor and skip this DVD...or if you do need to purchase...turn off your television and listen to it over your stereo system...of course this defeats the purpose of buying a DVD but it's the only way you will be able to tolerate this...if you want to get a good concert DVD buy Sting Brand New Day tour...awesome..."
4,"If you like Billy, you will love this concert.",I got the VHS video from this concert and it was great but this DVD incredibly overpassed the audio experience. The concert is great and the video quality is great. I have a big screen TV and I felt like inside the concert.
3,Great Concert--BAD direction!,"Billy's great here--and a Yankee stadium concert is an inspiration.But the cheesy 80's video effects (Stop motion--strobing, eeech.)get so annoying as to make some of this concert unwatchable.Enjoy Billy's music, but close your eyes!"
2,DISAPOINTED,LOVE THE MUSIC. HATE THE WAY IT WAS FILMED. THIS WAS SHOT LIKE A MUSIC VIDEO ON HIGH SPEED. AFTER WATCHING THE FIRST 10 MINUTES I WAS DIZZY. WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE SHOT LIKE THIS? IT REALLY TAKES AWAY FROM THE WHOLE CONCERT. WHEN I BUY A CONCERT ON DVD I WANT TO FEEL LIKE I AM THERE IN PERSON WATCHING IT!
3,It's good!!,Bill rocks the house that Ruth built!!! I just wish there were more oldies of Billy Joel on it!! Turnstiles album and prior!! Miami 2017 is awesome.
1,Horrible,"I had purchased this before seeing the reviews. Such a talented performer andthe DVD is ruined by the video. Can't get by it, the video made this the worst concert I have ever seen. This is text book ""how not to do it""."
1,great concert - awful video,"I love Billy Joel and the concert at yankee stadium was obviously a great night but this is the worst concert video I have ever seen, totally irritating in the way it is shot, you feel seasick after 5 minutes as the camera never stays still for more than 3 seconds. NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,Enriching,"Light-hearted, sad, funny, enjoyable, wonderful, likeable, tasty, rich, depressing, uplifting and all together wonderful. You name it, they've got it. If one wants to see life open up into beauty and enjoyment - it's just the turn of a page!I enjoyed this book because it had some very special stories that hit the bottom of my heart, my stomach, my toes and gave me goose pimples all over!"
4,Heartfelt,Really an inspiration and a true invitation for positive thinking and CAN DO attitude. Stories of true courage that people can relate to according to their circumstances.
3,Motivational speakers don't motivate.,"Forty-six pages into Canfield's and Hansen's book and I can say that I'm only marginally interested. The thought of reading a book written by two motivational speakers isn't really ""inspiring"" to me. They generally promise to sell you a new personality (at inflated rates) and what you actually get is a few hours, or if you're lucky, a few days of elevation, followed by a return to your regularly scheduled life. That's not permanent change, it's just a temporary loan.But I checked out Chicken Soup from the library, so I might as well see it through. So far, a few of the stories have been heartwarming, a few have been tearjerkers, a few seem a little too contrived, and particularly one story seemed just plain strange (""I taught the audience how to vigorously rub their hands together, separate them by two inches and feel the healing energy""...huh?). I certainly hope more of the tales are of the ""heartwarming"" variety."
5,Chicken Soup for the Soul is as heartwarming as said to be,"I am an 18 year old female who has gone through many losses, such as the loss of my father and I found this book (as well as all the other Soup for the Soul books) to be a help in more than one way. I was honestly astounded at how much of a difference it made by reading a few stories....It really makes you think twice about not only who you are........but who you want to be..........."
4,My cup runneth over...,"I have too much chicken soup, so much so that I was confusing this 1993 CSFTS book with the 2012 chicken soup ""The Power of Positive"". This is the better of the two and has a good idea and just enough seasoning to make it palatable. The stories have uplifting themes and the stories seem to all be true and inspirational. A few of them are written by the non-professionals (to whom the events happened) so are not all well-written or exciting. Enough of them, though, deliver a good punch and are well worth the read. It is a convenient package with short stories (2-3 pages) so you can set it aside and consume in small bites."
3,Good thoughts to consider.,This is a good brand. Positive and worth reading.Good values to mull over. Awaiting the next book from Jack Canfield.
4,Chicken soup for the soul indeed!,"I got this book almost 14 years ago as a present for my good friend Teresa. Since I'm at a stage again where I can't concentrate much while reading, but I still enjoy reading, I picked up the book and started reading it. I read it with much pleasure and was really comforted by some of the stories. Just as the book says, the stories make you smile, laugh, cry, and feel all kinds of emotions. This book is literally chicken soup for the soul (however corny this may sound it's true). It's a good read if you are in the mood for it, and who knows, you might learn a thing or two, and even get inspired to live life more fully and definitely more present."
1,Cheesy money making vehicle,"I'm sorry, but Chicken Soup for the Soul annoys me to no end. The stories are not original-I've seen most of them in various forms in chain letters and Ann Landers and Dear Abby. Most of them are VERY poorly written, cliched, and dumbed down. When I'm depressed, they make me feel even WORSE. I'd rather read a cynical, sarcastic very nasty story that makes me laugh-and realize I'm MUCH better off! Sorry to say, but these books are nothing but dollars for the creators. You're better off rereading childhood classics for a pick-me-up."
1,Why do people like this?,"""Checken Soup for the Soul"" contains a series of short stories where horrible and depressing things happen. And then the story ends. Each story contains an act of kindness, but the main focus is a sad, depressing, or horrible situation. For example, a crippled boy chooses a crippled puppy to be his pet; and a young boy dies of cancer surrounded by friends.Look, if you love watching Dramas on TV, you'll adore this book. Ditto if you like crying. For myself, I just don't understand how this is supposed to be uplifting."
3,"Good, not great","I picked up this book based largely on the fact that it is a #1 NY Times Bestseller and that it has received rave reviews. My impression after reading it is that the book on the whole is not worthy of its stature as one of the bestselling books in the past 2 decades. Some of the stories are good, and some do evoke emotions. But the ultra-short length of the stories makes them seem (again, over all) more superficial than stories of greater length. It's difficult to convey a compelling feeling or thought (which, by their very nature, need some context) in one or two pages. But some of the stories are good and I'd recommend others to pick up this book. Just keep your expectations in check."
4,Chicken Soup for The Soul,"I read this book in one sitting. I laughed and cried and now I'm making out my list of all the things I want to accomplish. Beyond heart-warming, I found this book to be inspirational and just what I needed for the crossroads ahead in my life. You need this book!"
2,I never liked soup,"This book was recommended to me by an inspirational speaker who spoke at my college. I can see how this book can be meant to inspire, especially the stories pertaining to ""live your dream"". Yes, this book does give you hope and to a certain degree persuades you to break the shackles which you have created for yourself; to break the rut which sometimes becomes our lives. Having said that, some stories were (to be perfectly honest) cheesy. Corny, even. ""The Hugging Judge""? Come on, that sounds more like a scene from a C grade kid movie. Even so, good read at times, inspiring also .....at times. Short concise stories. Worth a read if you are willing to forgive the extra extra dose of too much sugar in the soup"
5,Travis from my youth,"This is a lovely album - just Travis and his guitar, after he and Bud parted ways. As I listen to it, over 45 years after I used to hear him live at the University of Arizona and around Tucson, I hear not only his great songs and fine voice, but I hear my own college life. Bud is dead now, and Travis can't play anymore after a stroke. What a gift it is to have him here on the CD just as he was at his best."
4,Power Metal,"These guys keep the metal spirit alive, intense lead guitar, catchy vocal lines and strong songwriting."
4,Very good!,"Hi, I'am a MLTR fan from India.This is definitely a good album to have as a MLTR fan.The great thing about this band is that in every album almost all songs will be wonderful.This is also not an exception.If you like melodious songs with good tunes,this is another good one to ur collection.Hope we get another album from them soon. Raj."
3,"I Don't Know How To Rate This One, But...","Basically, the movie Spirited Away was another masterpiece, just as expected from master animator Hayao Miyazaki. To hear more about the movie, you can see the reviews of others and myself about the movie. But judging the comic is a hard decision.Basically, the movie was good. And that's the problem, because the comic is based entirely on the movie. All the pictures are taken from the frames of the film, and the quotes match those of the theater version of the film. Basically, it is better off watching the movie than the comic, because there is hardly any difference, except for the fact that one is a film and one is a book.It is based on a good movie, but I just simply feel there is no true need of reading the comic. Again, don't mistaken me; I have nothing against the comic, but it is far better off watching the movie."
4,"Good novel, but not as memorable as his later novel, Dreams","Very good novel. Makine demonstrates his ability to make the distinctly different experience of growing up in Siberia, and the more universal experience of male adolescence gripping. It is hard to judge the prose since the novel is translated, but either because of the translator's faithfulness, or because of the translator, Makine appears to be a very gifted prose stylist. One comparative note, however, Makine's novel, Dreams of My Russian Summer, which was published earlier in English, was actually written subsequent to this work, and translated earlier, presumably because of its apparent success in France. It is a greater work, that treats many of the same themes. After reading both, you realize that your assumption that Makine's work is intensely autobiographical may not be correct."
5,A Truly Beautiful Book,This is one of the best novels I have read. It encompasses everything a great work of literature should. The prose is so beautiful. Mr. Makine is an enormously gifted writer. I highly recommended it. Excellent!!!!
2,Difficult and confusing,"I had such a dreadful, struggling experience reading this book. I couldn't understand a word of it except what the back of the book said. When the author went off on his poetical tangent, I was just lost. I couldn't see the symbolism, although I knew it was there. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Makine is a very talented and gifted writer, but I think only those who read poetry and novels that you have to concentrate on would enjoy this one."
5,What a beautifully crafted novel,I hope the girl who didn't understand the novel will try a little harder. It is so beautifully crafted. It holds in its pages the heartbreaking longing of youth for love and for their future which is mysteriously yet to unfold.The narrator senses a life beyond his present circumstances through the Transsiberian train's windows. However he sees another future in the harshness of day to day existence there in Siberia. Makine puts a human face on that far unimaginable country. He also teaches us of the loss of war. It is a woven tapestry of character and time in which each piece contributes to the whole.
4,A beautiful story about nothing and everything,"While I'm a big reader, I generally avoid translations because I'd rather read the prose exactly as the author wrote it. However, I was traveling and out of reading matter and happened upon this book at a shop and bought it. And I was glad. It's a lovely and lovingly written (or at least translated) tale that strongly evokes a sense of place--middle-of-nowhere Siberia--and time of life--adolescent on the cusp of adulthood. The book starts off a tad slow--it is in one sense about nothing but daily routines--but if you stick with it, you'll find yourself drawn into this beautiful story of love and growing up and Jean-Paul Belmondo(!)."
2,Old fashioned story...,"... and very boring. The pace of the book is slow, and it is very conservative in its ideas. Even though I don't enjoy excessive dirty language, the morals of this book are so different than the 'modern' ones that it makes it hard to thoroughly understand, especially for a non - American who doesn't have the proper historical background.Then why 2 stars? Because I think that this is the sort of book can appeal to people who are looking for all the points mentioned above in a book - the slower pace, the historical perspective and 'name dropping', etc."
1,never received my purchase,I have been waiting for over a month for this CD. The CD is amazing but this seller has not sent me my paid for purchases.
4,Good looking and worked out well,"The costume was delivered quickly. It ran true to size and looked better than other Indian costumes that I had looked at earlier. I was not very pleased with the sponge headdress. While it worked o.k., it was alittle floppy and did not look as well made as the rest of the costume. The headdress up close looked cheap. For the money and for the Thanksgiving production the class put on, I did the job."
3,Errors in RFE-RL schedule; Errors in Lithuanian TV section,"Please note that the language 'Classical Lat.' indicated in the RFE-RL schedule on page 499 simply refers to Latvian, and not Classical Latin as one may interprete it. Hence, the times and frequencies shown under 'Classical Lat.' should be put under 'Latvian'.Also, 'Kosovian' (on the same page) is a program in Albanian targeted at listeners in Kosova.As to Lithuania, please disregard everything that is included in TV section about this country (page 625). The information there is several years old and totally out-of-date."
1,An experience to Forget,"After all the hype and the marketing campaign and stars like Kareena Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Jackie Shroff and Amrish Puri and the Subash Ghai name the movie at best is disappointing.It is a very feeble and baseless attempt to represent an Indian family living across two continents.How a single Indian father raises three daughters in England and India is the essential theme of the movie. The theme provides a phenomenal opportunity to explore the nuances of children who are raised in a dual culture syndrome. Failing to take this opportunity, Subash Ghai settles for less than mediocrity.The performances are lifeless,concept of editing is lost, the direction fails to tango with the script and the music is a mishmash of Anu Malik's past scores.This film does not hurt your sensibilities simple because it assumes you have none.Not a film, I would recommend."
5,Does speak to the spirit!,A very enjoyable mix. June is featured but has lots of help from the group. The titled track is the best.
5,Perfect fit,Chose these because of the assortment. Nails fit perfectly in my Stanley nail gun. Price was right. Will defintely buy again.
3,Good but ummm,I ordered this as I purchased a nail gun and found out the nails were not available locally... I received exactly what was advertised however almost all of the strips were broken up and the box was broken open inside the shipping box. It was sent with no internal packing just the smaller cardboard box in a much bigger box.
2,Senco A209809 18-Gauge-by-5/8'-Inch to 1-1/4-Inch Variety Pack Brads,"Have not used the two brad sets I received yet, and may have trouble trying to use them due to poor packaging in the shipping box.The Brads are packaged in plastic press fit blister packs about the size of a candy bar. The packs were shipped in a 12"" x 6"" x 4"" cardboard box with a piece of bubble wrap and no means to secure them from moving. The blister packs must have moved around considerably during shipping because both packs opened and the brad strip separated into anywhere from single brads, to strips of only a few brads, to a half strip of brads. I don't know yet if my nailer will accept very small strips let alone single brads.The brads themselves are probably fine as a product, but Amazon gets a ""F"" for shipping. Keep this in mind when ordering small parts that cannot handle shipping without being secured. Sigh....."
4,Brads,"Bought these brads to go with a nailer I recently purchased and what can I say, they are finishing brads. They seem to be good quality and have had no issues with them at all."
2,Could have been better,"The brads were random sizes in each package with the majority of the smaller sizes, two packages didn't have any 1 1/4would not recommend purchasing this if you expected same quantities of each size."
4,I Like The Tin!,"The two discs included hold some minor Film Noir from the late 30's through early 50's. I have always liked Beat The Devil, D.O.A is a fun, outlandish Film Noir, and the others are right on par.The price was very good, and the films may not be academy award calibre (The Stranger is a standout), but they are solid Film Noir examples with known actors like Bogie, Edward G., Peter Lorre, John Garfield, Gene Tierney, Vincent Price, Orson Welles, Jennifer Jones, Edmund O'Brien, Pamela Britton, Richard Conte, Jose Ferrer, Yul Brynner, Scott Brady . . . and etc. Not bad for Hollywood stars and character actors.The quality may be lacking on some of the prints, but all in all you can't beat this gritty, fun collection."
4,Great collection of FIlm Noir,If your starting a collection of film noir or just want to watch some good writing on film catch this collection.
4,Enjoyable!,Most of the movies were very good and really held my interest through out. A couple not quite as interesting.
3,Good and bad,"Some of the bad films are not even funny. The good ones are interesting. six, five, four, three, two one."
3,I was most excited to get these,"but they came damaged. Now I live in Bangkok and I do pay a lot for shipping and sometimes VAT too, which really hurts. I am a disabled US Veteran and have to watch my funds. I know many are doing that too now. Hope things change in Nov. change!Well one of the movies came disloged and was scratched. The tin was bent up too, so not happy with all of that. It is not worth it for me to send back then pay for reshipment and chance of Vat. So do not know what to do. Thanks"
5,My favorite book of all time,"Its wonderfully creative, and deliciously eerie. Its a difficult book to get through, but if you can do it, it is 100% worth it."
4,"Confusing, but so good","The book can some times make literally no sense whatsoever. But when you do finally understand it, you'll definitely love it. It's a great idea."
2,Disappointing read,"I won't rehash what others have written in other reviews about the content of this book - if you wish to read a summary of the plot then go through some of the other reviwers' comments. Yes, this book is clever, yes it it is large in its scope. But to what end? I kept waiting for a purpose to the whole Navidson Report (the fictional report that is discovered) to appear - and was disappointed. Endless footnotes - but again - to what end? Not really worth the effort it took to read."
4,Thrilling,"I wanted to read this while I was abroad and wondered why there wasn't a kindle version. I ordered a hard copy and found out it would be a very difficult book to adapt to that format given the appendices and margin notes scrawled in by the ""author."" It's an ambitious and thrilling novel about a house that's bigger on the inside than the outside and the family that chronicles is, the blind man that's obsessed with their reports, and the young man who discovers all these notes and has his life changed in a way where I feel like I should end this sentence without a spoiler. The story is complex, and not necessarily light reading, but the author does a fantastic job at achieving what he was going for."
1,This book doesn't deserve any stars,"The worst ""novel"" I've ever read. Quite possibly the worst possible ""novel"" ever written. Plotless, poorly written, incoherent, and juvenile. The language takes turns being dreary and over-the-top melodramatic. Danielweski seems to believe that he can substitute pointless (unless his point was to uproot an entire South American rain-forest) typography and pseudo foot notes that take up half a page for an actual plot. I think it's a disgrace to literature when people mistake incoherence for artistic talent."
3,good....but not worth the time,"I had heard from several people that this novel was the scariest thing they ever read...period. This intrigued me and I finally took up the task of reading it. Once you commit yourself to reading this book, and you do have to make a commitment you get sucked in pretty quick.It starts off with one storyline and the next thing you know there are four separate storyline and you are bouncing all over the book to keep up and deciphering codes. This book definitely demonstrates a fresh new style, but the wheels fall off about three quarters of the way through. After finishing the 500+ pages I felt like I spent more time than was necessary to finish it.Great book for the first half...then it gets wordy and loses all focus. I'm interested in the author's newest book, but just not right now...ken."
1,a tremendous disappointment!,"I really wanted to like this novel but, ultimately, a novel should have something to say to the reader. It should at least make a point. Style and structure are interesting, but House of Leaves says nothing, and is pointless."
1,Don't be fooled,"This book is not nearly as smart as it thinks it is. In fact, it's a pretty empty book trying very hard to get you to think it's a smart book. Had to laugh reading all the comparisons to Joyce, Pynchon, etc. There is NOTHING in this book that's remotely ""Joycean"". The prose is terrible -- clunky and imprecise -- and the ""erudition"" feels like James Michener-style research.As a story, it's a lot like ""The Good Solider"" -- all foreshadowing, no actual story. As a scary story, it's a lot like H.P. Lovecraft -- plenty of adjectives telling you how awful, horrible, frightening, etc. everything is, but there's nothing remotely awful, horrible or frightening behind any of it.All in all, a big bore tricked up with typography. Read a genuinely smart book, like The Recognitions, instead."
1,House of Leaves: A Waste of Time,I read some of the book reviews on House of Leaves and was interested whether or not the book was good. The reviews were very polarized so I took my chances. This book is nothing more than random stories thrown together with font changes and pages with upside-down words on them for effect. Do not waste your money on this book
2,Cool premise buried in fancywork,"This was a chore to get through. At times it was very effectively creepy, but its far too long, and its pretension is much heavier than its insight. I thought I would be rewarded for actually reading all the fancywork, and I was disappointed. Yeah, it's clever making the reader have to flip the book around and such, but if most of the words are just ornamental, it just ends up being a frustrating exercise."
1,Waste of the paper it's printed on,"Without a doubt, the worst book I ever read. Just plain annoying. I would rather go to lunch with a Kardashian than read another page of this wothless garbage."
3,"Good, not great","While I enjoyed this book, I can't say that this is ""fiction that makes all others seem less important."" Having unique, changing type-face is not new: William Gass & Georges Perec. The story itself of HOL is reminiscent of Nabokov's Pale Fire & Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones or Labyrinth. The relationship of Reader Writer Character is tested in most of these works, usually involving a corrupted or unreliable narrator (with exception of Perec).The book is good, I just don't think it has ""perfected"" anything, or that it is ""eons"" ahead of all fiction. Mr. Danielewski has written a solid, entertaining book with glimpses into the horror & isolation within man's heart & mind. A solid 3 stars (I rarely give anything more than three)."
5,A Mind-Blowing Trip Into the Dark,"Wow! I'm going to have to read this one several more times, maybe even write a page-by-page analysis on it, just for the heck of it. This was an incredible book. There's really no way to give a synospis of the story line (um, which story?), or really go into depth about my feelings for the characters (um, which characters?), there's just too much here to write about, and it would take way too much time and space to do it.This book is so deep, so disturbing, and so fabulous, it has instantly moved to the top of my favorite books list. I recommend you read it, whoever you are, whatever your interests are. It will spur your imagination, and leave you wondering about life long into the night. Not to mention looking carefully at every dark space to be sure it isn't expanding.So go! Buy the book, read the book, become changed by the book, and by all means, write in the margins!"
5,"""Experimental"" only begins to describe it.","This book dares you to read in a non-linear fashion. It has kept me enthralled (and maybe a bit obsessed) thus far, and I often find myself wondering about the *house* when I'm not reading.My only complaint so far is that Amazon sent me a slightly damaged book, with a few folds in the paperback covers. I know I shouldn't expect it to be perfect after a read-through, but it was still disappointing when I opened the box."
3,Why God Invented the Internet,"This was a brilliant web site/piece of internet art/whatever, back at the dawn of cyberspace history. Somebody at Pantheon said, ""Hey, let's see if it works as a Novel. If it does, maybe the Internet won't drive us out of business."" Well, it sort of works as a book.Besides putting certain ""keywords"" in blue, underlined type, like a paper facsimile of a hyperlink, there really isn't any reason to kill trees printing this out as a book. (It weighs, like, twenty or thirty pounds.) However, since the web site is apparently gone, a book is the only way to enjoy this very, very excellent piece of intellectual brain candy.And yes, I do mean intellectual. If you don't have at least an honorary Master's Degree in Literature, you won't get it. At all. I had to take a class just for this book. But it was worth it."
5,A work of staggering talent and imagination,"A complex, brilliant work which, as the other reviewers have set forth, can only be compared to Pynchon. House of Leaves is a thoughful, brilliant expansion of the structure of the novel format which challenges the reader and entertains at the same time. Thank God MZD is not wasting his time writing a screenplay, as his staggering talent and imagination should not be confined to 120 pages."
3,Odd book,"The reviews I saw said this was a great book and it was also listed as a recommendation from Amazon. Well I bought it and while I appreciated the duality of the stories, I thought it was too long and both stories had spells of being uninteresting. I was happy to have finished it and donated the book to someone else."
5,Lovely.,"This book was just beautiful. Not only was it wonderfully written, but it didn't conform to how people think the ""standard"" novel should be written. It is also one of those books that I couldn't get out of my head after finishing it. Highly recommend this novel!"
5,A wonderful debut ...,"This book is bursting at the seams with inventiveness and ingenuity. While I think that Danielewski still has a ways to go before becoming a complete writer, the sheer joy that he shows tearing apart narrative constructs reminds me of the first time I read ""Gravity's Raimbow"" or ""Naked Lunch"".The thing that struck me the most is that it truly makes you question your reactions to a genre (horror) that makes it's usual living off a direct access to your emotions. Is a scary moment less scary just because it's in a footnote? And if so, why? Is it any less ""real"" than anything else printed on a page? If we're told that the whole story is made up, it it less horrifying? Aren't they all?If you are interested in the new wave - Wallace, Vollmann, Eggers, et. al., this is a must read. If Danielewski can grow from here in future works, he may be the best of the breed ..."
4,unusual and disturbing,I bought this book at an airport before getting on a flight.I practically had to be pried off the plane because I didn't want to be interrupted! This is probably one of the strangest and most disturbing books I have ever read. This book creates a real feeling of dread that will stay with you long after you have finished the book. The unusual writing style makes it a challenging read but it is well worth it.
3,Much Ado About Nothingness,"This is an excellent horror tale with a big, fat load of window dressing (mostly contained in bloated footnotes and appendices). If you don't have a month of your life to devote to it, just read the main narrative (Zampopo's diary), skip the rest, and leave yourself some free time to go outside and exercise."
3,I don't know if I finished it...........,"I read this book when I lived alone and it freaked me out. I thought the idea that the reader could get more involved in the story rather than simply turning the pages was exciting. I read the version where you have to flip it upside down, read in a circle, skip pages, and read through strike-outs. However, in more than a few spots, I got myself lost. Finally I got myself so lost, I'm not sure I finished the book (which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars).The story itself held my interest for awhile, but then it became monotonous. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes to figure out puzzles and is looking for a challenge rather than your average scary novel."
3,a crumbling house,"i read this book through and only wish it had a story to tell. Danielewski should find new editors, ones who will tell to him to get rid of all the meaningless footnotes and the special effects, which are more of an irritation than anything. maybe they could tell him that the story is what counts and not the lofty notions and packaging."
1,"Boring, pretentious, and about as edgy as a marshmallow.","There's nothing wrong with this book that couldn't have been fixed by having Stephen King rewrite it as a short story. The central conceit (which I won't reveal here in case you go against my advice and read this book anyway) isn't a terrible idea, but Danielszewski doesn't do anything of interest with it. The framing story, filled with Johnny Whatshisface's hedonic adventures, might be titillating if you've lived in a church basement your entire life. I haven't."
2,Far too deep and convoluted for me,"Maybe I'm just not cut out to read such complicated literary devices as this. But, I gave up about 100 pages into the story within a story within an enigma wrapped in a puzzle. Too many layers for anyone who isn't a student in a modern lit class or a professional literary critic."
1,Endless...,"Keeeeeeripes! I read the other reviews and was intrigued by the idea of weaving time. The only time shift I found was the daunting feeling that the dang thing was never going to end. The only reason I was compelled to read more was because I couldn't wait to finish it to see if something meaningful would actually happen. 700 pages and the answer... nope. An obvious first-time authors attempt to use all the [stuff] he accumlated writing reports and ""being creative"" in college. In fairness, the story(ies) would've been an interesting 150 pages. The rest - dead trees..."
5,all your favorite authors are either dead or are communists,"forget understanding through comparison to dead authors and don't even bother with the post-this and post-thats. i haven't seen or heard the supposed hype, but i like the author's boundary expanding methods and appreciate the promise of a challenge. i'd recommend this book if you really enjoy experiments in prose and convoluted plots and enjoy the sensation of detachment. i'd tell you to avoid it if you are: a) a big fan of genre fiction b) unable to relate to anything without first comparing it to at least three other things c) overly concerned with a book's lasting value to society d) spend large amounts of your free time writing reviews on web sites, or e)see title of review"
3,a dark book with no bottom,i am not sure that this book makes any sense.** but Johnny and Lude are pretty kewl. :)
2,House of Leaves,"I like horror, so when I heard of the House of Leaves I had to pick it up. It was very difficult for me to read 2 stories at the same time and I very quickly grew frustrated. To complete the story, the only thing I could do was read the actual story of the House. I realize the problem is my own, as I like a quick and straight read. For those of you who can concentrate on more than one story at a time - this is a great book. I rated it a 2 because I grew so frustrated with it, but I did enjoy the story itself. For those of you who grow frustrated with the switch in narration, I would suggest you just read the main story first and pick up the rest later. It is a good book, but I found it daunting at times."
2,Not thanks...,"What a really weird book and so damn hard to read. I gave up. I only read part of the story then sold the book used. I thought the content would be more interesting and a good story. So far from it for me. Couldn't really follow all the jumble of the story, I think they just wanted to put together a ""cool"" book."
4,Are you afraid of the dark?,"This is quite possibly the scariest book I have ever read. There is definitely no need for visuals here, your own imagination will be enough. I am actually starting to fear my closets."
4,Surface readers need not apply,"Make no mistake about it. This book will challenge you to dig for meaning and wrestle with the words. Your efforts will be rewarded. Not perfect, but it will make ya think."
4,Just give it a try......,"There are a lot of reasons to dismiss this book after a cursory glance. Seems to be a erudite (snotty/pretentious) Blair Witch Project or a very pale Pale Fire. The clever use of footnotes was exhausted in Infinite Jest. Derivative as it may be, House of Leaves is a riot. I work in a bookstore of a lot the reaction has gone the route of ""oooooo...it's creepy."" I just haven't got that as the main thrust; it seems like there's too much worth paying attention to. While the game the book presents is much less complex than Nabokov's, it's still not a People crossword puzzle to VN's New York Times brain buster, and maybe I've got a sick sense of humor, but the book is pretty funny. (If you watch the dates on the footnotes, appendices, ect, it's obvious the whole thing is the work of a preveracatin' crackpot. Anything more than a superficial comparison to the Blair Improv Fest seems unfair.)"
4,A Unique Book Indeed,"There are a lot of good things about ""House of Leaves,"" but there are also bad things...however, the good outweighs the bad. The good: thought provoking story, interesting premise, and the way Danielewski plays with text is beautiful. Sure, Johnny Truant is a bit annoying at times, but only when he whines about his mental conditions--Danielewski succeeded best when Johnny told stories, and not when he rambled like a punk-Lovecraft narrator. Zampano should've been developed more, but that is made up with the excellent characterizations of the Navidsons...Overall, a good read, a bit challenging, and ultimately rewarding."
4,House of Leaves is an ultra-promising debut,"In all the crazy fuss surrounding this novel--much of which it deserves--something has been lost: a sense of history. This book fits comfortably into a past defined by the work of Pynchon, Alasdair Gray, Nabokov, and others. Very few of the devices used by the author are unique, although he does use them well, for the most part. His use of footnotes, however, is often out of control, to the point that he begins to annihilate his own central narrative--a narrative that, despite the horror aspects, is really a love story. This is the strength of the novel: the central relationship between the photographer and his wife.I'm a writer and, to be honest, I could not tell whether my irritations with the narrative were because I wished I had actually written the book or because the book does have some flaws. Regardless, this is great stuff and I can't wait to read his next novel."
5,"You don't finish this book, it finishes you","This book messed with my head. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about. When I was reading it, I couldn't concentrate on anything else. This book dug it's claws into me, no joke. Not for the conventional or faint of heart. People who have lost their fear of adventure need not apply. Are you at an age where new and interesting ideas scare you? You wont like this book. Don't like thinking outside the lines? You won't like this book. Like to challenge yourself? YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK."
3,"Some beautiful writing, but it falls short.","As another reviewer has mentioned, it is a great undertaking to read House of Leaves. I, as a lot of other readers of this book, was prompted to read it because I am a fan of Poe. (The singer, not the writer, although I do like Edgar Allan. Heh.) There are some incredibly mind-blowing parts to this book- some parts that are so well written you have to stop yourself to remember to breathe. But the format does get in the way, and the constant reference material that is thrown in between chapters, and the page flipping back and forth to keep up with both narrators gets very frustrating at times. Pretty soon the beauty of the book is lost in the chaos and I could not faithfully finish it because I was so disappointed with the development of the story. However, it is an experience, and maybe if you are more patient than I, you will enjoy this book."
1,OVER-RATED AND UNREADABLE,"This book is a grossly over-rated piece of unreadable literary masturbation. It's similar to Joyce's 'Finnegan's Wake'--self-indulgent, cryptic scrawls and references lacking in true poetry but designed to keep an otherwise unemployable group of English professors, 'literary theorists' and critics working. It is meticulously designed, researched and written, lacking in soul and substance.If you enjoy puzzles and frequently pat yourself on the back for your depth of classical or literary knowledge, you'll enjoy this book. If you're a pompous ass, you'll absolutely love this book.If you're a relatively normal person who enjoys a good read, on the other hand, this book is a complete waste of time."
4,uh huh...,"some dude gave this book a bad review, which i would've taken seriously if he had not made reference to Anne Rice as an author of good and scary fiction. Anne Rice is joke, and so is anyone who takes her work seriously. writing vaguely macabre stories about homosexual french vampires is worthy of nothing at all save the awe of suburban Goth Kids from Miami. Read House of Leaves, it kicks Anne Rice's butt (i ain't finished it, but i'm already quite taken by the work)."
2,A very badly written book.,"House of Leaves is incredibly repetitive and long-winded. The author has no idea how to make characters that readers connect with, and a good 20% of the text in this novel isn't even worth reading. A large amount of this book is just words for the sake of words."
2,Just a distraction,"""House of Leaves"" is Borges for people who can't get bored.Labyrinths: Selected Stories & Other Writings (New Directions Paperbook)"
4,Entertaining in a Talmudic sorta way,"I found it to be an engaging read, with some moments of real thrill and chill. The style I'm more than used to given the talmud study background I have. If you are interested in seeing what multitudes of interrelated cross references (a lattise-like structure), go take a look at Herman Wouk's ""This is My God"" which give a bit of an overview on the topic. Or look it up on line. For those not used to the multi-layered style it can be a bit disjointed. Still, it was fun and nothing if not immersive. I remember reading (I think it was Harold Bloom) a quote about Faulkner to the effect that his misuse of language is so striking that sometimes, for just a moment, it shocks you into thinking like the narrator. I imaging the style of this novel just might be able to do a bit of the same. Enjoy."
3,"ok,alright,not bad,ambivilance,middle","so this book is really well written in parts, and its nice, fun all that makes you flip back and forth like dfw which is annoying cause you need two or three bookmarks, but thats ok, cause usually the writing is ok, basically if you like, well, you know youll like this book if youre buying it so reading reviews is pointless, i just beleive that people who are really impressed with this book haven't read much, like i mean much of the book is just like other books, like pale fire, or the third policeman or even borges, heck the whole minotaur thing and labryinths hmmm where'd he get that idea, and yeah you need to read the third policeman right now if you like this book, but who cares if the ideas arent his its still well written and kinda fun kinda annoying so middle , three stars not bad but to be honest i wish id spent my time reading something else like, if i was gonna read something for fun i just wish it woulda paid off.oh well, tough luck."
1,Useless.,"This kind of ""experimentation"" was already over in the days of Woolf and Joyce. Not only was D.F. Wallace incredibly overrated and incredibly out of touch, but he's left us a legacy of second-rate regurgitated drivel like this as well. Thanks, guy.Whatever happened to telling real stories about real people?"
1,I didn't like this book and I couldn't get into it.,The only thing I liked was the stripper with a Thumper tattoo. That was cute.
3,Different,I liked the idea behind the book and the explorations into the house. The remaining materials were gimicky. Leave out some of the Appendices and save a few trees.
5,Love it...or hate it. No middle ground.,"I look at this book like the herb cilantro. You'll either love it or hate it. No one reads this and says ""it was OK.""Amazingly put together, the _story_, if you want to call it that, is told from a perspective that I found unique and haunting. The book is quite nerve chilling; my fiance read it and it kept her up at night wondering if the house she was in held the same mysteries."
1,House of Cards,"What is all the hype about? This ""first novel"" is a derivative, contrived muddle that tries frantically to appear clever and original by tediously exploiting every known postmodern ruse but which at nearly every turn consistently fails to deliver, leaving the reader with the same queasy and unsatisfied feeling as if indulging in too much cheap junk food. The unoriginality and ponderousness encountered in this book are on the same scale as the rooms and passageways in the house it describes. I was bored to tears by the obviousness and clumsy moral earnestness of it all. The final subtext of this book--if you follow all the footnotes--is desperation, the result of someone trying like hell to pull the wool over your eyes for fear of revealing the only truly grim realization of this horror story: it isn't written very well. The publication hype is as shallow and faddish as the book. Save yourself 20 bucks."
3,A story about the power of storytelling,"For those of you who read the book: When you finished it, did you find yourself believing that there was a documentary called ""The Navidson Record,"" even though you were advised at the beginning that no such thing existed? This to me is the most interesting part of ""House of Leaves."" I think the footnotes and lists are there to build the idea that this is authentic. Even the denial of authenticity at the beginning adds an authentic flavor to the story. Yes, the ending is deeply unsatisfying and the typographic gymnastics annoying, but I think he's on to something here about contemporary myth-making through the accumulation of detail. A footnote of my own: I found the letters from Johnny's mom to be at once tedious and disturbing, which is kind of weird, no?"
5,it was about time,"Not just fiction...not even a thriller. It is hard enough to put yourself rapped up in the 708 pages of a book, leaving no space (space?/darkness/a cool hand) untouched, just to state the obvious: when dreams turn to nightmares you have to do something about it. It was about time..."
1,"Ultimately, just a first novel","All young writers should have good editors. The book is, like most first novels, fresh and interesting, but ultimately self-indulgent; replete with author intrusion, self-congratulatory cleverness, and a whole lotta time wasting. Character development is virtually nonexistent and the plot doesn't so much advance as trail off into some unexplored corner of the house of title fame.People posting reviews who compare this book to Nabokov or Borges really should go back and re-read some actual Nabokov or Borges, either of whom can say more in a page than this writer can say in a hundred.It's a nice try. It has some decent ideas. Postmodernists will probably like it, 'cause it's all so avant garde doncha know. But it really isn't a novel so much as somebody's writing journal accepted for publication. Read _Pale Fire_ or one of JL's parables, and save yourself a week."
1,House of Self-Congratulation,"This book did grab me...for a while. I'm a Gen X-er. I live in Los Angeles. I can completely relate to the atmospheric backdrop of Truant's pre-psychotic world and thought a lot of the personal storytelling rang true. I'll even go so far as to say that some of the writing here shows flashes of brilliance and is very vivid and engrossing. But ultimately I can't get over the author's haughty self-indulgence. He's clearly enthralled with his own perceived cleverness. Ultimately for me the book smacks of the over-intellectualized slacker conversations that permeate trendy coffee shops at three o'clock in the afternoon from people who don't have anywhere else to be. Don't believe the hype and don't let others snobbishly insist that if you don't like this book, you obviously don't have the capacity to handle heady material. I'm a voracious reader of serious fiction and non-fiction, but this book is all bravado and no substance."
2,Crock Of Leaves,"A rather interesting little story has been buried under enough post-modern trickery to ensure high-school study halls will be abuzz for years. Danielewski goes out of his way to be very very very very very innovative and daring, and ultimately just gets rather tiresome and dull.This has all been done before, and done better, by writers from Stephen King to Alasdair Gray to Edgar Allan Poe to Shirley Jackson to Jorge Luis Borges. I can't fault Danielewski on ambition, just on execution.Ultimately, some cool things, but not enough to save a book that sinks under its own postmodern post-literary weight."
5,House of Leaves,"Even if it takes you a season or a year to finish this book, you will be completely in awe (if not a little insane) by the end. Do it. It will enhance your perspective of writers."
5,Changed My Outlook,"If you're reading this review you are not here by chance. Fate has brought you here because it was the right time. This book has ruined me. I keep looking for the same ""high,"" the same ""thrill,"" that this book gave me, but nothing compares. I tell anyone who will listen to read this book. I used to try and explain it, now I just say read it, it will change you. If you prefer exploring the mystery to knowing the mystery...read. This book is an exploration into what motivates us - what motivates love, ambition, understanding, and forgiveness. This book is beautiful, and it gives back everything you put into it. You may not receive answers, but you will certainly be moved."
5,Gets you hooked,"When I first started reading this book, I was like ""Eh, okay, whatever"". But as I progressed, I found it hard to put down. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. I also found myself taking it with me wherever I go just in case I'll have an extra few minutes. The thing I like the best is the typeset-- it keeps changing as the house changes. Crazy, but brilliant. Definitely one of the best books I've read."
1,"waste of time, paper, space","I tried to find something positive to say about this novel and can only come up with: ""The cover's nice!"" I guess the idea is clever enough, but the gimmicky nature of the text is just overbearing. A friend of mine took one look at the blurbs on the back cover, including one from ""writer"" Bret Easton Ellis, and told me not to bother. I should have heeded his advice. I found myself ripping through the pretentious bits, the footnotes (my God, the footnotes!), and even the secondary story about the guy who finds the manuscript and is caught up in the horror of it all, to find out what happens with the house itself. Definitely not worth the time and energy. If you like tricky, read Eco, read Borges, read Pavich... but don't live to regret reading this mishmash."
1,very disappointing,"The concept of House of Leaves is an interesting one, but the execution is extraordinarily poor. The writing is horrible, the characters are paper-thin, and some of the paraliterary conceits (or whatever they are) are so sophomoric I was actually embarrassed for the writer. Very much like the house in the novel, this book is a huge, sprawling mess with exactly nothing at its center. Do not waste your time on this book."
4,Great,"This book is scary. Amazing but scary. Made even scarier by the fact that when I looked it up it had 666 reviews. But, seriously, buy it. It's fascinatingly written and amazingly interesting. I couldn't put it down."
5,5 1/2 minute Hallway,"Mark Z. is a master of language. This is the type of book that you cannot ignore. He made the story within a story interesting and accomplished it well. This novel is not like other novels for this one reason- it isn't all layed out for you. You have to do more than simply read, it recquires your thoughtsand feelings and soon, like the characters within it, you will be trapped in the 5and 1/2 minute hallway. buy it, you will enjoy it."
1,pretentious,"I have nothing to say about this book except that it's pretentious and half the pages are blank. i feel like i bought brian griffin's ""wish it, want it, do it""..."
2,I don't get it...,"When an author doesn't understand the difference between ""should've"" and ""should of"", ""could've"" and ""could of"", and ""would've"" and ""would of""... Well, that's just retarded. I first thought he was doing it with only the character of Johnny Truant, which would've been bad enough, but then it showed up in the writings of the old man, which was unacceptable to me. This book had some great ideas and I was mildly enjoying it, but then it started to insult my intelligence, and I had to cast it aside... Be gone with you!!!"
1,Awesome,"This book really cracked me up. You really have to have the right sense of humor to enjoy House of Leaves, one of the most amazing literary practical jokes ever written. It is touted as a horrifying tale of terror and mystery, but there within lies the joke. Danielewski will have you decoding letters, reading footnotes 3 pages long, and staring at evidence within multiple appendecies. If you make it through to the end, you are in for a treat! Turns out this book is a comedy, NOT a horror story, so horror lovers, you may want to skip this one. Danielewski has you hunting for a terror that quite certainly does not exist within these pages. You will, however, find entertainment in the fact that you have just read a novel about a book put together by a crazed tattoo artist about notes written down by a blind guy on a documentary that may or may not actually exist."
3,Mistaken Idenities,I think Bret Easton Ellis should stay out of the business of predicting what Thomas Pynchon thinks.
1,An excellent example of form over function.,"It's a shame the house on Ash Lane wasn't in New York, as it could have been leased for millions.Seriously, this is some of the most awful tripe I've ever had the misfortune of reading. The multi-level narrative, when done well, is a literary device meant to keep a reader's interest; however, in this case it only prolongs the banality of the novel. I mean, how many times are you going to be fooled with Truant's hallucinations? After reading ""But none of this ever happened"" for the nth time, all I could think of was what if it never happened that I plunked down 20 bones for this trash.And then the footnotes! Just one headache after another contributing little or nothing to the story.Lord preserve us from erudite pseudo-authors."
3,Brownie points for trying something different,"This book is quite good. I don't want to attack it because i applaud the fact that the writer has tried to break away from the conservative and conventional novel structure that most writers still employ. It is ambitious and unusual and makes a nice change from run of the mill novels. On the other hand the characters are a little chliched and undeveloped and the prose is a little clumsy. Sometimes writers get so caught up in textual experimentation that they forget, or don't have the energy to take care with the prose. If you enjoy the textual experiments and the parody of academia in this novel, you might also enjoy reading 'The Third Policeman' by Flann O'brien. He was pushing the limits of postmodernism even before Borges. He is also a master of prose and a comic genius."
4,Great and eerie!,"This book can bamboozle you and I'm not sure exactly how they got the printers to do some of the intriguing page layouts! However, I don't think it's the story that you should focus on too much, especially if you're looking for a typical beginning middle and end. It's the eeriness of it that should be experienced. This is a real original classic for those willing to open their mind."
4,A Good Horror Story,"IMO the best horror books are those that don't directly expose the creature or fright. This is one of those books. It leaves you on edge, however, wondering what is going on and what is going to happen next. Even when things are calm, you wait for the next event.As others have said, it is also a story inside a story. You could probably read the main story and enjoy it, however, if you want to stretch your imagination and test your reading skills, go ahead and read all of it, including the voluminous footnotes that comprise the ""outer"" story.The author does an excellent job of painting the characters- I can see Johnny Truant and even feel his turmoil. The term ""horror"" book can be applied to books that feature supernatural or unexplained beings or it can apply to regular (well, almost) human beings who live or subject others to a state of horror. This book accomplishes both.The book is a challenge, but a fun one, and one thatshouldn't be read just once. There are too many nuances."
2,"Potential, but stumbles and never recovers","The writing itself is beautiful and Danielewski certainly has a great measure of talent. However, underneath the footnotes, pages containing only one phrase, secret codes, etc. is an old story that is not being told in a new way, it is just being shuffled, reorganized, and splattered across the pages. This book could have been excellent-had Danielewski actually written something original. Consequently, it comes across as pretentious, and the characters and the novel itself ultimately are like the hallway and the house- devoid of anything, really. Read it if you have too much time on your hands, too little imagination, and love cheap 'psychological' chills."
2,Too clever for its own good,"As a dedicated fan of the ghost story in its many incarnations, I expected great things from this book. Perhaps that was my mistake, expecting a ""story."" Instead, I found that the many annoted footnotes just detracted from the overall effect. This is a brilliant concept and the extreme attention to detail lends some credibility to the genre of overlapping reality and fiction. But the constant distraction of looking here and there at footnotes, half of which are for effect instead of information, made it seem like a thesis, not a novel. And as to the story itself, there's not much there. A great approach theoretically, with potential, but its basically a concept piece and not too engaging a book."
2,painfully postmodern,"The book's premise is intriguing and I enjoyed it at first. However, it's pretty hard to sustain interest when you're writing a book about a book about a fictional documentary about a house. Too much attention is given, in my opinion, to the layers of text and too little to the plot. As fascinating as the idea of the house is, you get very little 'pay off' through plot development. The text itself--the arrangement of words on the page--becomes the entertainment rather than the text's content. Large sections of this book are parodies of academic writing, but for anyone who dropped out of graduate school these parts may seem far too close to the real stuff to be entertaining. It's certainly an ambitious book, but I don't think that it is--or is even really meant to be--an enjoyable read in the way a good novel usually is. Danielewski apparently concentrated his efforts on playing on tedious postmodern ideas about texts and not on actually producing one."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"This book has gotten a lot of good reviews in the media (Newsweek, NYTimes Book Review, etc...)but it is a colossal waste of time to read it. The writing is dull and puerile (Johnny Truant?) , the plot is stolen almost directly from the ""Twilight Zone"" and you will be bored stupid from the infinite footnotes. I think its hype in the media is just a case of a literary emperor with no clothes on, there is nothing of substance in this book; if someone asks you to read it, say no, put it down and walk away..."
2,I fell for the hype.,"Imaginative? Yes. Strange? Definitely. But scarey? I don't think so. I was really, really dissappointed in this book. After reading all the reviews, it sounded as though it would scare the pants off me, but I didn't find it frightening in the least. Instead I found it rambling, repetative, and predictable."
2,Held my interest and then became ridiculous.,Wow. A house bigger on the inside than the outside. What a cool clever idea I thought. And for a while it was. Then the nonsense with the lists and silly fonts began to seem without purpose and tiresome and I gave up. Can you recommend 1/3 of a book to someone?
5,What are you doing?,"You've read the other reviews. You've looked it up on Wikipedia. Or you haven't, whatever. The question is: Why are you still wondering if you should buy this or not? You should. Do it. Do it! Now. You won't regret it. If you do, you can email me and call me bad words."
5,Possibly the Most Amazing Book I've Ever Read,"This book was possibly the best book I've read in a long, long time. It was completely engrossing! I couldn't stop reading it, and through the excitement and frustration of everything it just took me over completely. It is truly a one of a kind book and I would recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and a lot of time on their hands!"
2,I don't see what the big deal is...,"After one of my friends told me how scary and good this book is, and how she couldn't sleep with it in her room because it freaked her out, I thought, ""Great! I like scary books."" Well, I don't see where she got the idea that it was so scary.The first 50 pages of this book are lifeless. I was completely bored. Then there was a five page thing describing an echo. It was like I was reading an extremely boring textbook for school.There were a few ok parts, and some of the Johnny Traunt stuff was kind of funny. I gave it 2 stars because of the use of different fonts and how they placed the words on the page for a cool effect.Oh, and whoever said you need a mirror to read some of the pages, they were just too dumb to realize that the ""mirror-image"" writing was actually just the same thing written on the page before, as in it had gone through the page, or whatever.Don't waste your time. Read Stephen King instead."
2,Good Concept But Not Worth The CONSIDERABLE Effort It takes To Get Inside This Novel,"I tried to read this novel from cover to cover, gave up after three hours and skipped around to what I hope were the good parts in the remainder of the book. The plot about the exploration of an apparently evil house that is larger on the inside than on the outside sounds interesting, but the disgusting details inside the plot itself, the mean and worthless characters, and the sheer weight of this deranged, non-linear, hodge-podge book combine to require more effort than I was willing to invest for the pay-off this work promised. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project are inaccurate and I feel are an effort to cash in by linking to what is a much better movie than this is a book. Might've worked more if it had been presented less radically instead of in a format of notes, lists, diary entries, narratives, and scraps of paper."
3,>>^..^<< 'Meow',This book is written well. Too Well. Infact a lot of it reads like a university text book that costs 200$ and has only ever been read by the author and no one else. The word sterile springs to mind. Some pages only have three words on them and often they are upside down or written in a circle; bound to make you look wierd if you read it on a crowded train! Typographical experimentation fails to take the readers attention away from the mess that these paper leaves are in. Books cannot be videos.
5,Her Hallway Moves Like the Ocean Moves...,"Flood I"" - Floodland - Sisters of Mercy Copyright 1987WEA Records LTD Published by SBK SongsI don't know, but I think MZD was in some Goth bar and the opening lyrics to Sisters of Mercy, Flood I came on and zeroed into his psyche like a Hood arrow:""And her hallway MovesLike the ocean Moves""MZD wrote a fantastic book. He generates the suspense of Hitchcock and the out-thereness of ""The Twilight Zone"" together in a fairly taught narrative. I got pulled into this book and it walked a new terrain. Very original. Very bewildering. A fun reading event. Like nothing I've read before. May be worth a try for you?"
5,The Most Important Writer of the 21st Century is Here.,"You'll be hearing a lot of hype about this book and its author in the coming months. And believe me, it's all true, and more. Danielewski is a Pynchon for the 00's, if not a Laurence Sterne for our times. The book is as brilliant as you may think, and goes light-years beyond anything else being written these days. As a first novel, it's nothing short of spectacular. If MZD writes nothing else for the rest of his life, his reputation is secured with this opus. Brilliant, unsettling, macabre, the book is fully worthy of all the accolades you will no doubt soon be hearing."
3,House of Leaves,"First off, I was never scared - so on a pure horror basis, this is a ""2 star."" The author's style is unique (least I've not seen it before). On page 20, its entertaining. On page 145, flipping all over the place is irritating. 90% of the footnotes within footnotes (yes, within footnotes) are irrelevant. The story is good but delivered in a questionable fashion. If you have nothing better to read, okay. But with so many other good (4&5 star) books out there..."
3,Soundtrack for House of Leaves,"I've only just started reading House of Leaves and can't really give an accurate review, but I did want to note that Mark Danielewski's sister is Poe, whose cd Haunted is a companion piece to the novel. In fact, I only heard about the novel after buying the cd, and then grabbed the book when I spotted it at the library. If you've heard Poe's music, then you know that she's a talented musician with an incredible voice. Her first cd Hello is a must-have, and while Haunted is quite different, it's no less brilliant. If you liked the book, I recommend getting the cd as well."
1,Overhyped,"I tried to read this a dozen times, finally soldiered through to the end. Waste of time. Sloppily plotted, poorly edited, way too long and just not particularly innovative compared to all the hype."
1,Three Things About House of Leaves,"1. It carries a rave blurb from Bret Easton Ellis. 2. It has been compared to The Blair Witch Project, as though this were something of which to be proud. 3. I will return my wallet to my pocket and back away very slowly."
4,A great summer read.,"A friend recommended this book to me. She said it was really scary and life-changing. I did not find it in the least bit scary. I would describe this book as a cross between The Amityville Horror and The Blair Witch Project. I thoroughly enjoyed the dual-action throughout the book, and was really sorry when it was finished. My only disappointment was to find it was more ""lightweight"" (MUCH less horror) than I had expected. Otherwise, it was a fun, quick summer read."
3,for Space Coyote,"Wow. I don't remember, upon reading ""jimmin""'s review, him saying that the book was bad. ""too deep and convoluted for me"" doesn't mean ""too deep and convoluted for everyone."" It seems that when Space Cowboy learned how to read in school, he probably should have also learned that an opinion isn't the same as a fact and that it's possible that House of Leaves isn't for everyone. Personally I'm about 200 pages into the book and I'm having trouble continuing. It becomes a burden at times, but I don't enjoy giving up on a book, I like to see them through. I also happen to be a fan of Anne Rice. I wouldn't call her an amazing symbolic writer, and I wouldn't put ""Interview with the Vampire"" into the category of literature, but making a personal attack on someone who enjoyed a book that you didn't is kind of childish, wouldn't you agree, Space Coyote?"
2,Typesetting as Literature?,"This book was quite disappointing. I was looking for good scare, and how scared was I? Not at all. I understand why the typesetting was messed with, but I don't think it added much to the book, other than increasing my annoyance. I think better written passages would have conveyed much more. Turning a book upside down and sideways does not equate to good literature. The typesetting and footnotes are used here to spice up a fairly dull story. It's not awful awful awful, but I've read better."
5,A must read..,"I cant say aything less than AMAZING. Its a must read for someone that wants a little scare with out the gore. You just have to get past the first 40 or so pages and I was hooked I was making other people drive so I could read in the car, and staying up all night by a lamp unable to put it down."
3,Be ready to concentrate.,"This was a good book. BUT...it's not one you can just sail through. You have to concentrate on every word. You have to have a lot of time on your hands to read. It's a bit like reading a research paper. An entertaining research paper. Like I said, it's good. It's an intelligent read, no doubt. It's a good one to recommend to people that you want to think you're smart. :)"
4,Still spooks me,"As other reviewers have mentioned, of the two stories here, one succeeds quite brilliantly and the other doesn't. The whole Johnny Truant thing was tiresome, repetitive, bombastic, and self-involved. I skimmed a lot of it.But the Navidson record was fantastic. One of my all-time favorite haunted-house stories. Some truly creepy moments that I still (months later) think about and that still make the hairs on the back of my head stir. Like the endless bicycle ride down, and down, and..."
3,Okay but overly long,"I picked this up without hearing any reviews of it. It was interesting but I quickly realized that Johnny was not an interesting character. I did like the story about the house, but it was layered in so much other fluff that you definitely lost the continuity of horror that should have been there.By the end I was exhausted and sick of the story. The pacing felt sonorous and I was skipping or skimming huge chunks just to get to the next section.The post-modern stuff worked in some places, but I had a hard time seeing what the significance of its use was in several places. Done properly it should have contributed to the sense of disjointedness and horror, but it was so prevalent in the text that it lost much of its umph.Still I'd recommend it if you're looking for some interesting reading."
5,Does the job here very well!,"I purchased this unit to trim native grass and weeds in my yard. The unit started right out of the box, ran well, and did a fine job. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Furthermore, Amazon.com does it well, delivers quickly and on time."
5,outstanding,I am in my seventh decade and have some mobility problems this Troy-Bilt trimmer is all it was said to be. Very easy to start and use.Troy-Bilt 17-Inch 31cc Gas-Powered String Trimmer #41BDT65G966
1,Be warned about ethanol in gas,"This was my second gas trimmer purchased to replace the electric trimmer that wore out. In both cases they worked for the first year and quit. I trashed them both - an expensive experiment. I have replaced the gas model with a Ryobi electric ""Power head"". This accepts standard tools and I have used the head with string trimmer, pruning saw, hedge trimmer and sidewalk edger. The 12 amp head has plenty of power for these applications. If you can stand pulling the cord arround, this is an excellect choice. My first Ryobi rand trouble free for 12 years.The Troy dealer told me Troy the warrantee excludes carburator problems because ethanol separates from gas and ruins gaskets. The warrantee is invalidated if any gas is used that is more than thirty days old."
2,Troy Built Trimmer,The product did not come when stated. Only after my requesting info did I recieve an update as to delivery date status. I finally recieved it a week later.
1,Biggest piece of garbage ever,"After about 4 hours of use, one of the clutch dogs broke in half, (bad casting), so I called Troy-built and was told they would not send a new clutch, and I had to take the trimmer to an authorized repair shop which was Eagle River Small Engine Repair in Eagle River, Alaska. Eagle River is about 200 miles from where I live. I took the trimmer to the repair shop, and the owner, John, told me he did not work on trimmers and refused to even look at it. I called the Troy-Bilt customer service line again, and Al, the idiot I spoke to told me I needed to make an appointment with a shop in Wasilla, AK that is not an authorized repair shop.I would recommend buying any other brand than Troy-Bilt, because they do not honor their warranty. In fact, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANYTHING TROY-BILT makes. Their products are garbage."
1,cannot hear harpsichord,"If you are one of the people who listened to the Egarr recording of Bach's Goldberg Variation and believed you would relive a similar experience by listening to the Egarr recordings of the Concerto's;forget it! the balance is a disaster. All one can hear is the orchestra, the harpsichord being in another world. As a consequence of listening to this recording I have decided never to purchase anything except unaccompanied Harpsichord. If you have not heard the Egarr recording of The Goldberg Variations you are missing a bit of Heaven. Get the Goldberg but avoid the concerto's"
2,"Laughable, unless....","These performances might give one a good chuckle if it didn't come at a $50 cost. This is ""historical correctness"" taken to a ludicrous extreme. The performances eschew legato, vibrato, rubato, dynamic contrast and every other tool of making living music out of dots on a page.If your idea of Bach consist of ""squeek - silence, squeek - silence, squeek - silence....."", then enjoy!!"

3,Nice Backboard and Hoop but Poor Attachment,"I purchased this for my son because he loves to shoot hoops in the basement. I wanted to purchase him a nicer backboard and hoop and found this one to fit the bill. It is nice with a large backboard and large, sturdy hoop. But their attachment to the door is very poor. You screw some small ""U"" metal attachments to the back of the board and hang it on the door. The backboard just doesn't set up on the door very well with this design. We have improvised with some towels and such to make it work better, but they really need to come up with a better door-attachment."
3,Basketball System,All in all the system is good I had only to fix the ring. In fact the ring used to tilt down pretty easily and I had to use a screw to fix it.
3,Door Hoop,This was purchased as a gift. The receiver has complained about hanging the hoop on the door. She wishes that it could be hung on the wall.
5,A treasure for sure,"I dont care what edition of the game you play but this product is a must have, if only for the information it contains. I was very impressed that even with all the other information available, this is still a useful product. This focuses more on the feel of the game and the information leaves a large amount of room to customize it to your own use, this was typical of 2nd ED. I recommend this highly to players in the Forgotten Realms."
5,Dog Toy,"I bought this for my 13 year old Wolf-Hybrid as a toy. He carries it around like a pup and is very careful not to bite too hard and break the sound box inside. He knows exactly how much pressure to apply to make the ""monkey noises"". It's funny because he'll often look at it in surprise, like he's never heard the sound before (tilt his head, ears perked up).We have a bunch of different varieties of mostly Mary Meyer plush animals with the sound boxes but this Monkey is his favorite; not only that but the Monkey has lasted the longest (about 1.5 years and counting)."
1,beck arnley bearing 051-3936,This product is not what's pictured. no housing and only one bearing....not the pair that's needed.You only receive one side of what's pictured.
3,A New Land,"Gracelin, wanted for murder flees Ireland with her daughter after leaving her newborn son with her father. The Atlantic crossing is a harrowing experience. Gracelin arrives in America and joins her brother Sean who is trying to raise money and arms for those back home in Ireland. Again Miss Moore tells it like it was. Here she must survive the pitfalls of life in New York and the brutal knowledge of the occupation of Ireland. Be sure you want to read the factual brutality that Moore describes. It is a good story. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
4,Good!,"A nice blues album, Carey Bell is known more for his harp playing than for other aspects of his music, but I found this album to be a fairly standard, electric blues album, with the blues harp a complimentary, but not primary part. The music is strong throughout."
1,Poor Product,"I tried the product 2 times and it did nothing. I have white hair. I thought it would easily take to the blond rinse, as did my hairdresser, who recommended the product for a temporary blond look. I needed to be blonde for a part in a TV series. I tried the product twice and my hair never turned blonde. I had to run out and get my hair professionally dyed in order to be blonde for my TV role. What a disappointment! It says on the bottle that it covers gray. Well, it does not!!!"
4,Billy Hart is fantastic,"This is a really good album. What a great combination. Guitar, Organ and Drums. It's traditional and yet up to date.But of all the things I like about this disc Billy Hart's playing is the best. I'm not all that familiar with his style but after hearing him here I'm going to check out some other stuff he's one. This is a good drummers CD."
2,bore,"Well, I know Martino, I know De Francesco and Hart, I know all about them, I have almost all of their albums. I know how great they can play, but this album really bored me. Guess it was a bad night. I have to disagree with all the precedent entusiastic reviewer. It's just a bore. Solos are not that inspiring, it's just a regular night by three top notch players. There's not magic in this record. I can't never reach the end of the compact... every time I fall asleep! (just a joke) And I have to say that I completly disagree with the guy who talked about Montgomery in his review saying that Martino is better in this recording. Martino (I'm sorry to say this, because I like him anyway) never, NEVER play in his entire life, one single magic note like Wes did. Sorry Pat, hope your next one will be better!"
2,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is King.","What a hyped cd this is. The genre of guitar, organ, drum trios is filled with dozens of better cds than this. My particular beef is Pat Martino's habit of playing a riff line again and again in the middle of every solo until he's totally destroyed any kind of continuity with what his solo started out to be. What happens..does he run out of ideas?....does he think this is a crowd pleaser?...is he trying to wake up Billy Hart (I don't think so!)This is the slow triumph of the mediocre over the real thing. Instead try any of the 1/2 dozen or so cds with Jimmy Smith and Kenny Burrell."
2,great to start but not longlived,I bought this trimmer about four years ago.It was great when new and the easy-start really was easy. The spool was rather difficult to load and sometimes the line would jam and need to be dismantled to free it up.It was quite heavy and the vibration often gave my hand a carpal tunnel-like strain.After four years it just stopped and now won't start. I have stripped it down to see if it was a carburettor problem but it is a very simple carb that had no obvious problems. It is not worth taking this to a repair shop. It seems to be designed to last out the warranty but is not quality construction.I wouldn't buy another but would consider spending a little more on a better quality make like Stihl or Husqvarna.
2,Buy something else,"I bought one of these a few years ago. It started running hot after 1 season and I brought it to a repair shop the next season after the gas tank sprang a leak. Then something else in it broke that the repair shop (and warranty) couldn't fix. I thought it was a fluke and bought a new one. Guess what....never has run correctly. Starts fine, and ran ok (some sputtering) for one season, now it sputters every time I rev the RPM's for full speed cutting. After doing some research, it seems that there are some sub-standard parts (Fly-wheel) and the warranty is useless. Also, tilling attachment is only good for very soft, loose soil. Next time, I'm going with a different brand. You should too. Why pay over a hundred bucks for something that's only going to last a season."
2,"Good First Year, Poor Longevity","I purchased this trimmer two years ago. The first year I used it I had absolutely no problems at all. However over time, it became harder and harder to start. Now it sits in my garage because I simply can't get it started. I'm not a whiz on small engines, but I know enough to check the spark plug and any obvious signs of problems, and I couldn't find anything wrong. Two years old and ready for repairs!I would avoid this unit if I had another chance."
1,Poor documentation!!!!,So far I'm peeved. If you follow the manual you won't be able to start this puppy. The manual describes a two position switch on the engine when actually it is a three position swith. The manual says to move lever all the way towards the primer bulb. Actually this is to stop the engine which makes the cutoff switch on the handle redundant. Correct position is in the middle. Manual says to push primer bulb 10 times!!! On taking it to service center tech pushed bulb twice (10 times will definitely flood engine) and then started and manually moved lever to third (run) position. Manual says lever moves atomatically to run position not so. Tech also says that this is actually a Ryobi that Troy-bilt has put their name on and that it is mass marketed for internet and that it isn't a very good machine. Have not used yet so can't comment on performance. Not sure if I'm going to keep it.
3,fun toy - easy to destroy,"I have purchased a number of the Kyjen Fleecy toys and my dog (and all his doggy friends) love them. However, the fleecy ball is not as sturdy as the braids and can be pulled apart. I purchased the size small for my 15 pound mixed breed and it didn't take him long at all (1st sitting) to partially destroy the ball. This is not true of the braided pull toys - he has had those for months with no damage. Love the concept, but wish it was sturdier as it is great to use when playing fetch inside the house."
1,Not a favorite,This is not a favorite for my puppy. It is the least used toy I purchased for her.I think the idea is great- but the fabric does not appeal to her.
1,cute for just a minute,"My dogs love to play, and like most dogs, they also love to take their toys apart if possible. This toy lasted all of a day or so before they figured out how it was held together. We ended up with a very long piece of material with which the dogs were no longer interested. I would not recommend this toy; it just didn't hold up."
5,giving thanks: a native american good morning message,This book was purchased for a great granddaughter who is very much interested in studying and learning about native american tribes. She is enjoying the book very much.
5,Meaningful,Charming illustrations and meaningful text intrigued my 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter. We read the book over and over. Teaching children to be thankful for all of creation is our responsibility and this little book is a lovely way to get the message across to young...and old...alike.M. Kate
5,Giving Thanks,"This is another great book that teaches children to appreciate the earth, which God or the Creator has given us. The pictures are beautiful and so is the message. This is a must-have book for any child's collection."
4,Good pins but expensive,"The advantage of a variety pack is that it gives you an assortment of these micro pins, so that you can check out what length you might need for a project, or which length pin you want to purchase in full packs. It is quite expensive per-pin to buy them this way, however. Mine came intact -- not split into small fragments. They work perfectly in my cheap pinner, and I know from a professional shop that they are excellent in a Porter Cable."
1,Bad micro pins--good brand,The 23 gauge pins were broken into so many pieces that they were unusable. Over priced even for Amazon. Will not buy nails of any brand from Amazon again!!
2,cost,I should have done more research. This product was way over priced. It all most cost as much as the gun to use it in.
1,Contents and practice tests are too trivia,"To use this book for review purpose, the contents are too detailed. But it also lacks of examples and exercises to serve as a textbook. The practice questions are very different from the actual exams. While it is a good idea to target the practice questions slightly harder than the actual exams, it loses the purpose if problems are simply tricky, trivia or unclear."
3,Paris Hilton likes it!,"When a publisher resorts to the likes of Paris Hilton for a positive blurb on any kind of publication, let alone one on spirituality, I'm outa there. No need to read any further and I took off two stars just for that. Sheesh. So no, I didn't read the book. I found a free copy online but declined to download it."
5,Wonderful ideas and practical advice,"Spiritual Warrior by John-Roger is extraordinary. This book taught me practical ways to live a more balanced, loving, joyful and authentic life. I found it insightful, funny, clever and revealing."
5,I recommend this book,"I recommend this book if you are looking for specific techniques -- not just ideas or words -- that you can utilize to get through your troubles or your negativity, and out the other side. This is not always an easy process, and for this reason the book Spiritual Warrior is not always an easy read. Nevertheless, I find myself going back to it again and again, year after year, because if I actually DO the techniques, it has always helped me get to a better place inside of me. Spiritual Warrior has been one of the most helpful tools I have found in life."
3,Gardening in the Garden State,"Beginning with a 17-page introduction that breezes through the basics of garden planning, planting and maintenance, the bulk of this book is made up of two-page plant profiles divided into fourteen sections: shade trees, evergreen trees, small flowering trees, shrubs, plants for winter interest, plants for down the shore, vines, lawns, ornamental grasses, groundcovers, roses, perennials, bulbs corms and tubers, and annuals.While there are color photos they do not appear on every page. Instead, in field guide format, they are thumbnailed into one color section.The best reference tool in the book is the zoned New Jersey maps that detail average frost dates, rainfalls and temperatures.While the New Jersey Gardener's Guide is a worthwhile look for the long-time gardener, its real strength is as a gift for a new resident or a new gardener."
5,This is a really good book,"I bought a used copy from Amazon.[com.] Several times I have wondered about a specific plant and found exactly the answer I was looking for in this book.It has roses, shrubs bulbs trees vines grass and ground covers. It even had Beach Plum.It doesnt seem to cover any vegetables. For vegetables my favorite book is Rodales Garden Answers. Just vegetables in depth yet easy and enjoyable to read."
4,Not Weak! But maybe for die-hards.,"This is not a weak performance. It's probably not the best but it's a great sample of the talented Modest Mouse live. This 10 song live set (which I wish was longer), is only officially available from their `Bootleg' site and is issued in a cardboard sleeve. Some of my favorites on 'Baron Von Bull**** Rides Again' are 'Broke', the seven and a half minute version of 'Doin' The Cockroach' and the mellow 'Bankrupt On Selling'. The recording quality isn't great but above tolerable unlike any downloaded set I can find on the internet. I would recommend this CD for die-hard fans or fans interested in their live show. Released: April 13, 2004."
3,"Great Band, Weak Performance","Number 1: Modest Mouse is a great band with many great songs(i.e. float on, ocean breathes salty, paper thin walls, your life, and many more). Number 2: Where is the parental advisory limit on this, some of the song have swear words and some of the songs talk and use swear words(i.e. paper thin walls).So overall, the songs are cool, but the performance is pretty weak."
4,PS2 the best overall video game experense of all time,"The PS2 is the best, its controller is the best, the games are the best, expecially when it has the biggest game lybrary so far with all the new systems today. If you have a kid who does not know how to play one of thoughs bulky video game controllers from the Xbox or Gamcube, the PS2 is your choice. The PS2 is the best and thats all I got to say about that."
2,I game overall would be really nice if it worked properly!,"The game slot doesnt open or close right, the system will not play DVDs and it overheats!"
3,Repackaged yet again,"How many times are the first two 10cc albums going to be repackaged? This smacks of opportunism and given the band's small devoted following it's unlikely that long time fans are going to buy this. Who is this record really for?All of the material included here is available on the import German editions (with more bonus tracks I might add)and the sound is very good. The running order is correct on the original individual releases as well. Personally I believe this is because their original manager is licensing these two albums and the outtakes to anyone who wants them. It's a pretty sad state of affairs when an artist has little or no say so as to how their work is packaged.The first album deserves 4 stars while the second, superior album deserves 5. The 3 stars? That's because this has been packaged and released by corporate bloodsuckers."
3,A little simplistic- but still helpful,"As a registered nurse, I personally found this book to be a little too simplistic. However, having said that I feel that the information presented is clear, and helpful for someone who may be somewhat overwhelmed by the diagnosis of Diabetes. For me, the biggest take away was the author's suggestion that a diagnosis of diabetes is ""not your fault"". Overall this is not the only reference you will need, but it is a good place to start."
3,Increasing one's awareness of the effects of diabetes,"This book helps to expand one's awareness and knowledge of the problems people can encounter when diabetes strikes. Surviving, improving one's quality and quantity of life are reach able objectives but not realistic unless you first follow the suggestions outlined in this book."
5,Great book.,"This is a great book on teaching people how to deal with diabetes. How ever why get yourself stuck on medication when you have a chance to avoid them? Polysaccharidepeptides (PSPs) are by far a growing alternative solution to helping our bodies deal with the immune diseases, like diabetes and MS. I recommend the book ""Kiss your life hello"" by Howard Pieper. For more information on PSPs go to www.smartliving.healthywize.com"
1,author wants to impress you with supposed knowledge,Supposed to be about type 2..... then WHY did she dwell so much on type 1. Much useless information..... not much to help you LIVE with diabetes!
2,"What's With All The ""Medical Authors"" Without Any Medical Training?","I hope people aren't buying this book just because of a simple forward from a doctor. It's a shame that people flock to the latest tome, and checkout uncredentialed books for direction in diabetes or any other matter. We can truely trust doctors, but we don't need the latest self-help book that's patched with a Type II Diabetes hook to do that either. Stop buying these overly-hyped books and start seeking your medical doctor. I know all the rock star ""medical authors"" are the stars of the health movements of our day and highly recommend these, but you can have shelves loaded with this stuff and it will do NOTHING for you. A much better option is ""Diabetes and You: A Comprehensive, Holistic Approach"". You will realize that due to the book's aggresive medical standards, you actually need a brain to read through it successfully."
2,Louis (Chicago),"This book scared me to death. Described how I had to measure my blood sugar with a kit. I was under the assumption that Type 2 diabetes could be controlled with pills. Other books confirmed this, and it is working for me. I also didn't appreciate, the arrogant, over-the-top writing style of the author. The American Diabetes Association Complete Guide to Diabetes is much better written and more informative."
3,Helpful,"The 30-Day Diabetes Miracle: Lifestyle Center of America's Complete Program to Stop Diabetes, Restore Health,and Build Natural VitalityThe 30-Day Diabetes Miracle Cookbook: Stop Diabetes with an Easy-to-Follow Plant-Based, Carb-Counting DietI also highly recommend the books in the 30-Day Diabetes Miracle series."
3,Recommend looking for a more up-to-date resource,"Just got this book in e-book format. I bought because it was highly recommended. What I didn't notice was that it was 10+ years old based on its original copyright. That's a lot a time in terms of a rapidly developing medical topic.Another negative is that the author is British and her terminology is often different than that used in the USA.I am just about 1/5 of the way through the book after about an hour's reading and find it to be very easy to read and systematic in its approach. The e-book version, however, doesn't have much in the way of features like hot links and interactive graphics that can make an e-book preferable over a traditional book."
2,Depressing,"I am recently diagnosed with Type 2 and this was the 10th book I read on the subject...and the only one that was depressing in tone. The author herself admits in her forward that she has issues with food and it shows - she talks a lot about never eating her favorite things again, which is not the case as long as it's done in moderation. I was handling things well until I read this book, then hit a downward spiral for 3 weeks afterward. The info in this book is presented in other books like Diabetes for Dummies and Everything You Need to Know About Type 2 Diabetes without the bummer!"
5,Help when you really need it....,The day I was diagnosed...I stopped at our local book store....the number of books on the market for diabetes was almost as overwhelming as the diagnosis!!!This book was a life-saver for me....it helped me to NOT wallow in self-pity. I wanted to get up and take action for myself...for my health...and ultimately for the future of me!!!It was great having something from the very first day to read...thank you Gretchen!
5,LEARNING ABOUT TYPE 2 DIABETIES,This book has answered so many questions I had and answers for questions I didn't have. Greatest book I bought for learning about how to take care of myself and why I feel the way I do. Why I am hungry all the time. Why I crave sweets. Why I feel tired all the time and more. Great buy. You won't be dissappointed.
1,Not impressed.,"To be blunt, I hated this book. I was diagnosed in May, 2012 and bought this book at the suggestion of a co-worker. It reads like hieroglyphics. The author jumps from one subject to another, no form, no reason, and I find she doesn't CLEARLY state her thought, using too many analogies. That may be acceptable in story telling, but not for this.I was expecting a clear, concise ""how-to"" manual - this is not it."
4,An Excellent Guide for the Recently Diagnosed,"I bought this guide the day I was diagnosed with Diabetes. It's guidance has really helped me get oriented and begin to properly deal with it. The writing is professional, yet comes from the point of view of a person that isn't just a physician, she HAS diabetes.The chapters are easy to read and each has a summary at the end. She gives the reader the choice of getting the basic information first, then presenting the clinical reasons to be reviewed in more detail later."
2,stupid,"This book is so lame, I cannot believe it got such good reviews. I've learned very little from it and I find the author uses a condescending tone. I am recently diagnosed, but not ignorant. Other times, she gets so complex, that I find myself skipping those parts. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you know absolutely nothing about this disease. By the way, I do not profess to know everything, because I don't by any means."
4,Book,"The ""First Year Type 2 Diabetes"" book was shipped on time and was in new condition when received. It was purchased as a gift and I therefore have no additional input."
5,Helpful,My husband is a newly diagnosed diabetic. so we had been looking for some kind of guide we could follow to get us started. We found this book very helpful.
5,Just diagnosed,Good book for me after being diagnosed. Practical information in plain English . Helped me understand my preconceptions about the disease and its cause.
5,A MUST-HAVE for Type-2ers!!,"I can't say enough how wonderful this book is! I wish I had known about it the first day I was diagnosed. I found a copy at my library when I was one month in from being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. I began to devour the book. It's written in such a way that you don't get overwhelmed. It gives you things to laugh about, and shares the medical information in small chunks that you can skip if you're not in that place at that time. Gretchen is on the big diabetes email list that I recently joined (). She is a fabulous person as well as a fabulous writer. Rick Mendosa, the another ()celebrity, is on the email list as well. Visit .mendosa.com for his website. This book is really a wonderful overview for Type 2 diagnosis. Share it with your friends and family. Donate a copy to your public library. Spread the word."
4,THE FIRST YEAR: TYPE 2 DIABETES:,"For those of us recently diagnosed with Diabetes 2, this is a veryhelpful book. Hearing the diagnosis for the first time can conjureup a lot of fears, but this book helps to calm the fear and gives youthe answers and guidelines you need. Definitely a good book to have."
1,Small Print,"I've tried to read this book, put the print is so small that it makes it very hard to read. If you have trouble with small print find another book."
3,Trying to learn about diabetes.,I bought this book at the same time as another. This book is in the conversation mode and seems interesting. I have read only two chapters so far but answers some questiong. I keep reading and learning about being a person with diabetes and realize that we need more people researching how this disease works.
4,Can't beat Senco,"Senco has been around forever and is a top brand in fastners, as a matter of fact they were one of the pioneers of the pneumatic fastners we used them on the job in the early 60""s . can't go wrong with them."
4,tight,these brad's do what they are made to do hold on tight.have went throught 2 box's of these and these brad's hold on tight.good to have a choice of size's to choose from.so go ahead and get you some !!!!!!!!!!!!...
3,Pack better next time.,I received this item today and the box of dewalt nails was opened and spread all over the inside of the box. Not a good pack job by whoever packed it. I took a picture of what it looked like when I opened the box. Looked like the box was ripped open prior to it being packed. Out of 2500 nails only 2100 survived.
2,This junt wasnt that great,"I think Kingpin SKinny Pimp and Gangsta Blac are damn good, but this CD just aint so raw. It's got some bass if that's what you lookin fo..but I aint feelin the lyrics..they didnt put much effort into this junt."
1,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this DVD but found it unimaginative and superficial, and full of the same scenes of a few re-enacters marching back and forth on the same piece of ground, while the narrator drones on. The coverage also seems dated and does not well reflect later scholarship on the decline and collapse of Rome's Imperium. I thought that the History channel could do far better than this. A waste of time, really."
5,wonderful cd,"excellent cdI love Sandi Patti and Larnel Harris duets, especially. That is mainly why I bought this cd.I got it fast and in great condition, too."
1,BubbaL are you serious?,"If BubbaL is right and the cars go over 500mph, this is the dumbest game ever. Concider there has never been a production car that could go over 300 much and only a couple to ever handle 200mph to have ""street cars"" go that fast is a joke."
1,Messy Antic deception,It might look very Jewish and kosher but it is pure deception. It is just another attempt from a deceptive orginization to trick Jews into becoming Xtians. Jews please stay away from this lie.
4,One of the better ones!,"The Messianic Passover Haggadah, sort of reminds me of a Reform Haggadah - it has all the elements but seems a bit on the short side. It does a pretty good job of blending the traditional elements with the details found in scripture about Messiah's Last Seder.It's not perfect, but it is one of the better ones available."
1,Not a true Haggadah,"I am sorry if I offend anyone, but I find this ""Haggadah"" and others like it very objectionable. No true Haggdah would ever quote from the New Testament, and to do so in this format shows a basic lack of respect for Judaism and Jewish practices."
1,This book is a lie,"It is not a haggadah. Jesus or ""Yeshua"" did not exist at the time of the Exodus, is not the Moshiach, and is not a deity. This is a book for Christians, not Jews."
1,THIS IS NOT A JEWISH BOOK,"This is an objectionable product.It demonstrates one of the ways many Christian prosletyzers use DECEPTION to draw people to Christianity.With due respect to Xians, if you believe that Jesus is the messiah/divine/son of God, etc. then you are a XIAN, NOT A JEW. That is one of the original divisions between Judaism and Xianity.So why is this book titled ""Messianic"" (i.e. Messianic Judaism)? It's a classic bait-and-switch: people looking for Jewish materials might fall for products marketed as ""Messianic Judaism"" when they would never select something marketed as ""Christian.""That's why you cannot trust or support these authors/publishers who use deception to ""steal souls."" Don't waste your money on this trash.If you are a Christian who is looking for the Jewish background of the Passover Haggadah/holiday/story, there are MUCH BETTER AUTHENTIC texts available on Amazon."
1,I hate to offend anyone but,"I hate to offend anyone but I find the idea of a 'Messianic' Haggadah offensive.Passover is a Jewish not a Christian holiday.I think it would be far more considerate of those who call themselves ' Messianic' to simply be Christians and not try to co-opt Jewish traditional practices, and use them in a way never intended."
4,Pretty good,"Of the Messianic haggadot I've read, this is one of the better ones.It has all the elements, albeit in abbreviated fashion. It talks about how it's important to celebrate as though we, ourselves, were leaving Egypt.The blessing over the candles is slightly different than the traditional one. The only other Hebrew blessings are over the bread and wine.As someone else mentioned, this haggadah does read left to right, and it has very little Hebrew."
1,PRODUCT NOT AS SHOWN,You do not see that the head part of custome ties around the chin in this picture. OR I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT IT. MY BABY WILL NOT KEEP ANYTHING TIED UNDER HIS CHIN ON. This is misleading how you MUST HAVE tucked the string into the costume for the picture shown. Shame on you
2,Our cat was completely uninterested in this.,"I got this for our cat based on the good reviews. My cat must not have gotten the memo.A little about our cat. She's a little less than 2 years old and still very playful. She loves chasing things and chewing on anything feathery and fluffy.This toy was neither of those things. She's never once played with it, despite smothering it in catnip, dangling it in front of her, or just leaving it out to get used to. It was, in short, a waste of money. Too bad, 'cause I really thought she'd like it.I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) only because it's built well, and if for some reason your cat likes it, it'll probably last a good while."
3,Interesting but Wins no Prizes with my Cats,"I personally think this is a great toy. It's well made and should last awhile. Unfortunately not one of my nine cats is enthralled with it. Fuzzy mice are more to their taste. So, lacking fuzz, it languishes."
2,Just Enough Information To Get You Into Trouble,"Unfortunately, this book attempts to include so much of everything that it succeeds in properly covering nothing of anything. It can only be used as a brief overview from which one must then consult (much) more detailed texts of mountains, routes, approaches, etc. For 14er's, I highly recommend Gerry Roach's book -- it is superb."
5,A Jewel of a book!,I found a used copy and it is one of my best books on oriental glazes! He describes his experiments in detail and has some great suggestions on how and why they work. Some of the materials are quite uncommon but replacements easily found!It's a worthwhile addition to a ceramic library!
5,If you love ginger this is the candy for you.,"This candy is great! It's sweet, spicy and delicious. It also help with nausea, always a plus. :) This is also a GREAT price. Try them they are awesome and addicting."
4,Smaller than the Ginger People Original Ginger Chews,"Chimes is as tasty but much irritatingly smaller than the Ginger People Original Ginger Chews. I was used to the latter, so I notice each time I dip my hand into a Chimes packet. My mouth also feels the difference, as Chimes disappears more quickly than the robust chewy mouthwork you get from Ginger Chews."
5,SO good!,"Chimes ginger chews are AMAZING. They are sweet and yet have a spicy, and soothing taste to them. Too good! It's hard to stop eating them!"
5,A Book Which Should Be On Any Traveller's Bookshelf,"Some years ago -- when going places was still a childhood dream -- I read this book from cover to cover. Where brochures are romantic, this book is sometimes almost TOO practical; the result is that once having read it, you not only will never be taken advantage of again, you'll know more about travel to wherever you're going than will be said in whatever guidebook you buy! A few pointers Lana gives: You have to bring enough money with you to do what you came for; plane fare (no matter how high) is really NOT the primary consideration when planning a good trip; Don't try to cram in other cities or countries just because they're ""close by"". This thin volume is a must-read before any trip. It even has a section on translating tourist promotion hype into English! Obviously written by someone with a lifetime of dealing with people on the go, Travel Sense should not be missed"
1,Wicca strikes again,"This is not Orisha, not Santeria, not umbanda, not anything except Wicca masquerading as some other tradition. If you want a deck relating to orisha and other African Spiritual paths then look at The New Orleans VooDoo Tarot."
1,El Hechisero...,"... is a funny guy.I suppose my question is, if Orisa gave us diloggun and obi and ifa, what the heck do we need tarot for? Also, regarding Umbanda, only in middle class Umbanda are the heads of the Linhas white. There's a whole history behind that that begins and ends with Getulio Vargas himself... but I digress.If one wants to use these cards, I suggest that they are only used by those who have white Eguns who practiced Umbanda Branca. Otherwise, if you're not a priest and you're just itching to add something ""out of Africa"" to your religious practice (or a really way out ogberin/abiyan/aleyo who needs a new godparent or whose godparent needs to straighten them out), learn Obi (coco) and get to know your Eguns, who, sometimes, are just as powerful as Oricha... or fairies ;-). Peace, Omo L'Oya"
1,oh geeze,This is beyond silly. Adding unicorns and fantasy creatures to African tradition. This deck is so beyond anything having to do with Orisha that Im amazed so many people bought it. Please donot wast your money
4,Excellent study guide for IIS v4.0,"The book is a great study guide for the IIS exam. Fourteen days really means 14 chapters, and it can be covered in three days in a cram session. There is some unnecessary stuff in there, devoting a whole chapter to NNTP and Scripting, which don't have too many questions on the exam. Still, it has excellent labs and can serve as a resource after passing the test. I passed with an 811. Don't waste your money on the expensive MS official curriculum. Make sure you have some practice tests like transcenders or CNE Quizzer, and make sure to use MMC."
3,After studying this book I took the test only to find out I,After studying this book I took the test only to find out I was not prepared for the test at all. Most of the material on the test was not covered in the book. The Sams IIS 4.0 is a good introduction book but only that.
2,Fair Book,This book is fair as far as IIS goes and yes I agree you can't learn IIS in 14 days. This book is dry and doesn't cover ODBC errors. I bought MCSE Test Success by Lisa McDonald and it blows this book away.The only good thing I can say about this book it that the MMC exercises are good but otherwise look elsewhere this book has WAY to much fluff.
2,I've seen better from the Sams Teach Yourself series.,For being a test prep book for a specific Microsoft exam this book does a poor job of targeting its audience. The information is generally valid but it is presented haphazardly and inconsistently. This book is a prime example of all the pitfalls of having six people author one book.
3,Middle of the Road,"This book does cover much of the vital info for learning IIS4 but it is also very dry reading and somewhat redundant. You can read it through and do all the exercises in 5 - 7 days or a long weekend (full time study) but you will eventually want to go somewhere else for a different perspective and more info. Not bad, not particularly good - if you find a great one let people know. I am still looking."
4,Good book for beginners,"I was (reluctantly) put in charge of an NT Server running IIS. I bought this book because I knew nothing about IIS and figured it would be a good starting guide. The book served its purpose and helped me learn my way around. Since I had no interest in the MCSE exam and never took it, I can't comment on the book's accuracy for certain. However, this doesn't seem to be the kind of book you'd buy if you wanted to know every detail about IIS. But, for just learning how to get up and running with IIS4, I'd recommend this book."
2,"Good grounding, but won't guarantee a pass","I bought this to prepare for the IIS exam, having had good experiences with the Windows 95 and NT Server books.However, I felt this book was rushed and contained quite a few typos, even asking the same question in review sections with different answers!I failed the exam, and found that at least 4 questions were not covered in the contents of the book. so while the book is a good grounding for anyone about to use IIS 4, it is not perhaps the ideal preparation for taking the exam, which is a pretty serious flaw. Be warned!"
3,Decent guide for the IIS4 test...,I just passed IIS4 this last week using this book (and Transcender). I consider this book to be the best of the books I've seen on IIS4.
1,"it doesnt work for laptop with processor 1.5 ghz, take it off from amazon","it doesnt work for laptop with processor 1.5 ghz, take it off from amazon.I tried on win xp on my destop still doesnt work .its a useless . non working item, amazon should not keep such itemsotherwise your reputation will go. I am going to return mine , i bought from amazon (tech for less shop)"
4,"The PTV-371-EF is an excellent tuner, I know !","Approx. 3 weeks ago I wrote my truthful review on this item.So far you are not interested in using it so I wonder why - I wasted mytime writing about an item that, for the life of me, hasn't had a lotmore interest from others than that from me.I'm not a computer geek but a five year old could set this item upby using GOOD COMMON SENSE.I've been recording live TV for weeks now & transfering them to DVD'swith very good reproductive quality, so I'm VERY happy I choose tofigure it out instead of whinning & complaining !Don Morton - Largo, Florida"
1,geekish,"Unless your computer is fairly 'virgin' with only simple codec needs and no other video software ... it won't work without a LOT of tweaking.Buy something better.Not even XP approved, forget Vista."
2,"Poor quality, not useful, not compatible, stinky","never really got this working right, or perhaps it worked as best it could. TV reception lousy, even over cable hooked directly to the device. Over the air stations impossible.The guide and all the rest of the features are fine, I guess, but never had much of a chance or need to explore them since the reception was so terrible."
3,It works...barely,"I purchased this so I could watch TV in my dorm room because it would be much cheaper than a TV. The main point is that it works, but there are several drawbacks.First, installing the software was a long painful process that required me to go online and download files from obscure locations.Second, the quality is not very good. The picture is very grainy and the sound comes along with a high pitch ring that drives me insane.Like I said before, it works and that is what I bought it to do, so I guess I got my moneys worth."
1,Software not compatible,"While doadloading the software a pop-up said ""that the device has not passed XP logo testing and could cause problems if I proceded any further."" If I could remedy this problem, it will fine by me."
4,Not For First Timers,"This book does not give steps, and as such you must be able to draw from reference material to make use of it. As a reference book, it does fairly well. The guns are shown from different angles, and the technical data given assists with research (provided the selection of firearms lines up with your research). Flipping through it a few times, I've yet to see any errors. The book also gives reference pictures of aiming postures and uniforms, making it a good reference guide for artists who don't want to spend two hours on google images trying to find that one useful picture."
5,"Amazing movie - amazing in HD, and awesome features","Brilliant movie, continuing the fantastic Joss Whedon ""Firefly"" series. (You don't need to have seen the show to watch the movie though.)Looks amazing on blu-ray, and the features - including a picture-in-picture visual commentary, which is amazing and I'd love to see on other discs - are excellent.And it's not region-crippled."
3,"3 stars for SciFi Lovers, 4 stars for Sci Fi Geeks","love the movie, but my wife really digs it. Reminds her a bit of farscape"
2,Sorry,"For the past ten days I've been living in Joss Whedon's universe. It all started with a copy of the series Firefly. Wow, what a great show! I'd never seen it before and can only add my vote to those who morn its demise. I was expecting the movie Serenity to be just as amazing, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Serenity lacked the warmth and humor of Firefly, and I couldn't feel the bond between the characters so evident in the series. Sorry, but for me Serenity is a cold, overly violent and forgettable B movie. After Firefly I was ready to join the Browncoats. Now I feel more like an Alliance mole."
5,Firefly Fan,"This was a good movie, especially for Firefly fans, we only got 13 episodes so this was a well received addition. The plot fit right in with the show but could be held on its own."
5,Why is Firefly/Serenity NOT on TV?,"Oh right, someone screwed up big time. Watch Firefly first, then serenity CE. The entire series is something that will stay with you forever. You'll be sad when the ride is over."
5,Amazing Movie and Series,"I was a Joss Whedon fan from the start coming from Buffy and Angel, so naturally I just had to start watching Firefly. Of course after the series was quickly taken off the air (much to my disgust) I was just as pleased to hear it was coming to the theatres as a movie. The plot lines do not correspond completely but it is understandable in order to allow new viewers to enjoy the movie and get a quick background introduction. This movie MUST be seen if not for the plot but for the wonderful interaction between characters and Joss Whedon's witty writing!"
5,Ensure you get this!,"The Region 4 ""Serenity"" 2 disc edition is superior and the best out of all regions with exclusive extras. You can find retailers from down under who ship worldwide.If audiences want a film with a good storyline and plot, excellent characters, snappy dialogues and a whole load of action, and science fiction to boot,buy and watch this dvd! Whilst having watched the ""Firefly"" television series will allow you to get into the story quickly, audiences can see this film without having any pre-knowledge of the universe ""Serenity"" exists in. The series was described as ""a western in space"" and the film is exactly that. Exciting, pacey and compelling this was by far one of the best releases of 2005. Of course, like all films there are weak points but these are few and far between."
5,Very nice,"It really has everything for a excellent film. A cast in which you care about everyone in the movie, the action, comedy, most important the story which are all spot on.I Wish the series would come back though, it would be very nice.But what the hell is with the cover? That is pure rubbish!!"
5,Great Set,"This is a really well presented set. The box is awesome, to begin with. The menus are simple and load in the blink of an eye. The presentation looks great, sound is good, picture is top notch. The extras are pretty extensive and there is new stuff over the previous releases.Recommended for any Serenity, SciFi or Western Fan."
5,WELL DONE JOSS WHEDON!!!,"What an awesome movie! I loved it! This is the kind of stuff that I think most people love to watch and the bozos at fox decide to cancel the show. This movie managed to tie up some loose ends, have action packed scenes, change your emotions from happy to sad to angry and on the edge of your seat thrills. There was no foul language so I can take my younger relatives and friends. I'm definitely buying this one. I just have to congratulate Mr Whedon for his outstanding work on this movie and to ask whether the people at fox are in the right jobs? BRING BACK FIREFLY!!!"
4,It's all Shiny....Love Josh,I'm glad I bought Firefly & Serenity. I had never seen the show when it was on network TV so all I had to go on were the reviews. I can see why the show didn't make it which is a shame because as we see with Serenity & beyond it would have been worth it to give it a real chance. Serenity isn't a great movie but it is so very sweet of JW to send this sort of DVD love letter to the fans (even down to the last speech about love) who are still preaching the word of Firefly (and generating cash) even tho' the show was canceled 5 years ago. Rarely do you see something done on this scale just for the fans (this movie doesn't hold much water without knowing in the series) and it's why I gave Serenity the extra star. It was a fitting farewell.
5,Serenity; the movie,"Without a doubt, the movie has widespread popularity and is proof that this TV series should not have been cancelled. This is a movie that reminds one the old western movies with gunslingers, bandits and love lost and found. This is a great movie and with the blu-ray release it becomes even better. Even if you do not like sci fi, you should try this one. Without a doubt, the movie has widespread popularity and is proof that this TV series should not have been cancelled.

5,I want a SEQUEL!!!!,"This is in my top-five movie of all time. I've seen it enough to have memorized it. It rules and if you've never seen it, BUY IT!"
4,Very good movie,"After a quite confusing beginning (I had not seen the firefly series), I eventually got into this movie and really enjoyed it. Good sci-fi is hard to come by: the scince has to be plausible, the fiction has to be fascinating and it has to somehow make sense as a possible future or alternative reality. So much science fiction falls short in one fo these three categories, but ""Serenity"" succeeds on all levels. The cosmology is credible, the story is gripping and the carachters are very enjoyable. It also leaves the door wide open for a sequel, as it seems obvious that there are more adventures to be had in the world of the Alliance, with its many planets and many moons. If there is a sequel I will be first in the queue to see it.Good gripping sci-fi. Well done."
4,Awesome SF,Joss does not disappoint with this excellent piece of science fiction story telling. This movie helps to wrap up several of the threads of the story that were left hanging after the Firefly series was prematurely ended.
5,sereinty,"BEST.MOVIE.EVER. nuff said, go buy this and the Firefly DVD set, you'll love them.LIGHTYEARS ahead of Star Trek or Star Wars."
5,Yet another work of art by writer/director Joss Whedon,"If you haven't seen the series Firefly, it won't matter, but see it anyway. It brings depth to the movie to know the motivations of the characters. (The DVD set has unaired episodes!) What the brain-trust at Fox were thinking when they cancelled the series is a mystery.""Serenity"" is awesome. Outstanding graphics, excellent plot, well defined and diverse characters, and brilliant acting. This movie answers questions left hanging from the series, but those answers are framed in a movie that makes sense as a stand alone show."
5,The greatest Sci-Fi adventure ever!,The Serenity movie is a phenomial continuation of the prematureley cancelled TV series Firefly. Joss Whedon has a knack for evoking emotional responses and shocking turns in this creative space opera. The character's dialog and interaction is genius and the twists and turns in the storyline leave you breathless and wanting more.
5,Secrets Revealed,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie ""wind-up"" to the ""Firefly"" series. Sorry it had to end!"
5,"Have mercy, give us Serenity Sequel","My heart wells up when I think of the ridiculously awesome joy Firefly, and then Serenity gave me... years after the phenomenon. It kills me to see, year after year, absolutely terrible tv shows and movies released and wonder what Whedon and crew could have done with a similar budget. Tears the heart to know that with each passing year a sequel becomes more difficult to engineer, and less probable.This DVD captures a lot of what I'm talking about, and I highly recommend it to anyone hoping to support such an incredible thing.If I ever catch wind of Whedon making a sequel, I will require several new pairs of pants. And underwear."
5,Excellent sequel to the Firefly series,"This movie is a must-see, if you were a fan of the series ""Firefly"". I highly recommend the movie to fill in many gaps that were left when Firefly was cancelled."
5,"Fan of Firefly or not, this is probably the best Sci-Fi you'll ever see","The only negative that I have about this film is that it's painful to wait, hope, and see if there will ever be a sequel. The cast and crew of Serenity mesh so well together and the plot is great."
5,One of the best Sci-Fi movies of our time,"I first watched this show on DVD not knowing anything about the story. I fell in love with the characters only to find ""Firefly"" had flew a bit under my radar when it was on TV. I have since watched all the ""Firefly"" episodes and still cant get enough. Excellent."
4,Storyline not always fluent but an engaging movie nonetheless,"First, I must say that having seen Serenity before the series a few years ago & then after the watching the series recently, one really ought to see the Firefly TV series before seeing Serenity. The characters & their plights are continued from the too-soon canceled series. Granted, the story line runs thin at times and some of the characters seem a little overdone. So what if one can tell what's CG in certain screens. Serenity is action-packed."
4,Serenity the movie in reveiw,Almost as good as star trek. The future is up to us if we put money and support to nasa and keep upgrading tech we will soon have tech like this. This shows the darker side of humanty. Overall good movie.
2,Bad Star Trek Episode,"For all you out there, this is really NOT Science Fiction, the great literature we sci fi fans love to read (and sometimes write). What this was was a bad Star Trek episode, and I mean from the 60s. Sure there were some decent special effects, but what about story, plot, character, etc. On second thought, it was a bad Battlestar Gallatica episode. Sorry trekkies."
2,Poor Production Values,"I couldn't sit through the whole film because of the poor quality of the DVD -- poor picture and sound quality. Why are manufacturers making such low quality DVDs now? One more thing, so many of these reviews are merely judgments of the fans of the movie or the series, or of Joss Whedon himself, with nothing about the movie."
2,Not So Great,"I bought this movie without seeing it because I'm not one to dislike many movies - actually, my friends like to say that I am a big collector of bad movies. This is one bad movie that I am going to have to agree with my friends on that I have added to my collection. This movie was that aweful that I am probably going to try and sell it on Ebay for whatever amount possible. The acting was terrible and the cheezey lines were even worse. This movie isn't worth the dust that's been collecting on it..."
2,Last Starfighter rides again!,"I put this level on the same level as The Last Starfighter. Terrible acting, bad special effects. Not sure why people like this unless its just a space comedy."
1,Unable to play the DVD on a HD player,This product does not work on a HD player. We have played it several times and it will never start.
2,A Great Disappointment,"Virtually everything I loved about the ""Firefly"" series is missing from the movie. The storyline of ""Serenity"" is only tangent to the ""Firefly"" narrative; the movie actually loses ground gained in ""Firefly"" when it comes to mutual trust, affection, and respect. ""Serenity"" also lacks the easy western pace and humor of ""Firefly"", to say nothing of the good lighting and always audible dialogue of the TV series. In short, ""Serenity"" most nearly resembles a video game. Much shooting and hacking and stabbing. Two of my favorites from among the original ""Firefly"" crew members die (although they are all favorites -- part of the strength of the series) and even the spaceship Firefly is finally smashed to pieces. I've watched the DVD of the TV series four or five times now and gave it to half my friends for Christmas in 2005. Would not consider giving the movie to anyone."
2,Somnolently,"Don't bother with the Firefly film; it's a piece of floating space debris in comparison to the TV series. All the elements that made the series interesting such as the dialogue, humor and character interaction and evolution have been thrown off the ship and what's left blown up (literally) into an archetypal Sci-Fi B movie. If you've spent too much time watching the series then this movie is the antidote that will cure you of any curiosity. This is one only the fan boys (who I see mindlessly mark down any negative review here) could love."
3,Anyone else disappointed with the DVD?,"Is there anyone else disappointed with the DVD? My copy does not have a chapter list and I think there should be another disc. The DVD doesn't do the movie justice at all! Hopefully there will be a 2-disc edition released within the next year or so.Oh yes, I love Joss Whedon!"
3,Science fiction western,"In science fiction, I think its important that you have a science expert to go over the story for plausibility. If they had one here either he did not know what he was doing or they did not listen to him.Overall the acting, the story and the special effects are very ordinary. Nothing really grabbed me about the story.If you like Westerns you might like it."
3,Watch the TV series instead,"The movie really isn't as good as the TV series Firefly that it was based on.I suppose the special effects are slightly better, but combine that with a boring story and worse acting (well they're the same actors, I'll blame that on the script), the result is something I'd recommend that fans of the series pass on.Yeah, the movie will answer some of the ""mysteries"" of the series, but as other reviewers have pointed out some of the background story has been changed, so what exactly is being answered? The series was better with the mysteries unanswered.If you're not a fan of the series, for only a bit more than the cost of this movie you can buy the four DVD and get four times as much entertainment."
2,Sub-Par Acting - Not Good!,"I bought this HD-DVD because of all the good reviews, but I am very dissapointed in the Film... I guess you have to be a fan of the short-lived series??The Acting/Plot was Sub-Par, like most B-Class Movies. The transfer to HD-DVD was not impressive. I am a Sci-Fi Fan (Star Wars, Star Trek, Etc.) but this one was not enjoyable. It had a few laughs, but there was always an ""evil"" undertone to the entire film, I watched the behind the scenes and the interviews, and for some reason all the people used a lot of profanity, not sure why?I think if the storyline was tweaked a bit, and better actors were used (the main character showed no expression in his face, he would say one line in anger and the other in happiness, all with the same expression), with a slightly larger budget, the movie would have been good.I'm going to be selling this one!Don't Waste your Money on this One!"
1,Retarded jr-high kid geek movie,"I rented this from blockbuster because I'd heard lots of hype about it being a cool movie. It is not. It's retarded. I might have thought this was cool back in junior high, but it was just dumb.I guess if you're a fan of the tv show you'd like it, but no normal person would enjoy this."
1,Star Wars Knock Off,"Flick is a cheap knock off of Star Wars. There is no creativitiy in the set, the acting, or the script. This rental was a total waste of money. In fact, I turned it off and didn't bother to watch the end. Save you money and rent something else for a real evening of entertainment,"
2,Not serene,"This movie, made from the ashes of the so ho-hum Firefly series (""Gunsmoke in Space"") did not surprise me by rising above the original. Why is it that all cancelled tv series now have to ""Go Star Trek"" by spinning off a movie? Unfortunately, when the original was soooo mediocre it is hard to justify."
2,The Fifth Element was better!!!!,"I don't usually complain about low budget movies like this one, I saw the Road Warrior and Guyver 2 and those low-budget sci-fi movies ROCKS!!!!But this film ""Serenity"" it pretty lame.It's boring and slow like Star Trek, it has very litte action, chessy special effects, so-so characters and the story is not so interesting. I think that Titan A.E. is much better and interesting even with his flaws.I also think that The Fifth Element is better because for a lame sci-fi movie when women are best and stronger, is more interesting, on that movie the main character is much cooler and the story is pretty interesting.I recomend Fifth Element than this film, if you want to se hard hitting women, cool story, cool main character, better special effects, better action scenes and some ""anime looks"" in sci-fi.P.S: The only good thing about this movie is the girl (main character) that is pretty cute and have some ""anime looks"".adios."
4,I could stand to hear a little more too! (Watch closely and you'll get it.),"Joss Whedon's space adventure ticks pretty much all the right boxes: it's sharp, funny, thrilling, and intelligent. He sets out to entertain and does so from start to finish, never allowing himself to take things too seriously, and never patronising his audience.To be honest, there's nothing new here, but it's done with such esprit and flair that its derivative nature is forgivable: This is homage rather than lack of imagination. If, however, Whedon had managed to come up with a more original story this would have been a 5-star movie.BTW, look out for references to other blockbusters including Blade Runner, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars series, along with many others. Even Kill Bill gets a nod."
4,Why must everything be Citizen Kane?,"I love this movie (ain't nothin' like it in the 'verse) and I don't care what anyone else says. Some of the reviewers sound as though they were expecting the ""Citizen Kane"" of scifi flicks. It's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it IS a fun way to spend a Saturday night.""I swallowed a bug."""
4,Thank you!!!,wow i thought your shipping was gonna be late but thnx!!!its only been like a week since i ordered it and now its here!!!thank you guys.also the dvd is good quality. just like new!!!thank you for sending it to me so quickly.
5,Watch this movie,"Great movie. I never got into the series on TV because I never heard about it but my brother told me to watch this movie and I am hooked. The writing is fantastic and the chemistry between all of the characters is so comfortable that you really care about everyone of them. Funny, exciting, just plain fun to watch. Even if you aren't a big Science Fiction fan you will love this movie. WATCH IT!"
5,Took eight years,"Watched Firefly for the first time eight years after the original series release and I can't believe it took me this long. I now get the hype and, yes, it's still incredible eight years later. Watch the 14 TV episodes first then Serenity which is a great wrap up of the series."
5,"""Curse your sudden yet inevitable betrayal""","Anyone who has seen Firefly will know exactly how much I wanted to cry when I saw the stegosaurous when Serenity first took the screen. For Joss to go back and include that minor, little, nondescript detail... I for one knew I was in for the time of my life.Then to go back and explain everything, fill out the Simon / Kaylee subplot, to make River normal. All of it... it made me literally cry it was so good.Now I'm sure plenty of folk here have told you what this is about and how gorram good it is. Well I buy that and I'm not going to fill your ears with more luh sha diatribe from my worn mouth.I just plead with you. Buy this movie. Let the movie fill you if need be, let it overwhelm you. And in the end... if you aren't feeling a might bit refreshed I will personally give you your money back."
5,great Movie,"would love to see this movie and the series to be re-kindled, love love love them all especially nathan fillion"
5,Greatest Sci-Fi Movie Evar!,"After seeing it, went right out and purchased Firefly, the complete season.Both movie and series are incredible works, suspenseful, lots of twists, action, deep themes embedded. What a treat -- did not even know to give the series a look until I saw the movie.Go view it now.Only big minus is that after you see the movie and entire first season, you will itch for more Serenity."
3,cool flick,"I had some minor interest in seeing this movie, but a friend of mine insisted that I borrow his dvd, so I went ahead and saw it.Wow! What an original story, great relatively unknown cast, good effects, and engaging dialogue.For the price, it's a great movie to add to your collection. Great as a group movie or to watch by yourself late at night."
4,Very enjoyable!,"Both picture and sound quality are petty good, though not outstanding. We have enjoyed Joss Wheedon's work as a television director and writer for some years now (Buffy, Angel and Firefly on TV). He likes to poke fun at many things in an intelligent way and this movie is no exception."
4,"Not perfect, but extremely enjoyable","I don't consider myself a sci-fi fan. In fact, I don't really consider Serenity a sci-fi movie. The loveable, lived-in characters and identifiable triumphs and struggles are what make this movie great, not the fact that there are space battles and spaceships (although those are fun too). If you're not into Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, or any of that stuff, you will probably still enjoy this flick. The themes and people will grab you and provide that good old-fashioned thrill missing from so many of today's movies."
4,rocking good fun,"A tad more violent than it needed to be, but this was a great continuation of the Firefly story. It answered many questions from the series and made the movie even more enjoyable. They pushed scientific possibility a bit far - but you're so busy enjoying the story and numerous surprises that you'll only realise it much later after the movie. Having seen the full series and movie now I hope they find a way to continue the story. If you enjoyed the story and humor of the series, you can't go wrong with the DVD."
2,Less boring than the TV show,"I like Sci-Fi - Stargate, Battlestar, etc. A friend suggested I watch Firefly. Got the first DVD, could barely finish the episodes. Boring! So incredibly slow. The premise is okay though. So when I found out they made a movie, I checked it out. If you like the idea of the tv show but can't bare to watch it, try Serenity. It sums up the entire idea and reaches a conclusion without wasting all of your time."
2,the most hyped-up sci fi movie in recent memory,I do not see what the hype is about. The story is unoriginal. Characters are paper thin. Action is underwhelming (the space battle sequence is less than 3 minutes). Humor is ill attempted. Serenity makes Phantom Menace (a rather weak episode in Star Wars saga) seem like a grand masterpiece.
3,can't suspend disbelief that much,"The story/script was better than average (comedy right on) and the acting quite good at times, but there are plenty of amaturish acting moments as well (TV caliber acting). For renegades in space, everyone is way too attractive, too.Special effects were also a mixed bag. The spacecraft scenes are as good as I could ever want, but the aliens (""Reevers"") were some of the worst I've ever seen...even for TV standards (basically, just ordinary people with a dentures, ripped clothes and some dirt).3 stars."
2,Not that good,"I am one who bought into all the hype that this is actually a good movie-it isn't. The acting seems robotic and I don't think the characters are supposed to be robots. (Heck, Lance Henrickson's character Bishop in the Alien movies has like double the personality of any of the characters in Serenity and Bishop is a robot.) I don't know if this is attributable to bad acting, bad directing, or both in Serenity.The whole movie plays like one of those bad Saturday afternoon movies that you start watching because nothing else is on, but then fall asleep to. I don't really have a problem with the way the actors look, the women (and maybe the men) look sexy. Also the visual effects are not bad. The story and premise is completely lacking. Why would the crew of Serenity continue to keep River on board once they know she is a weapon? They complain and whine to each other about it but never do anything about it-doesn't make any logical sense.Also the 2nd A.D. work in Serenity is really bad."
3,NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE TV SERIES,"SERENITY, the movie, has somewhat stronger production values than the TV series and the return of the original TV series cast, but except for SERENITY fanatics, the feature film version will be a disappointment. Even die-hard SERENITY fans should expect something more from a feature film over a TV series but it just isn't there. Yes, there are a couple of slap-face kung fu scenes and breakfast-in-your-throat chase sequences but not enough to overcome the ""dead"" spaces where nothing seems to be happening except yak-yak, ho-hum Serenity crew meetings. The cast has visibly aged, which is to be expected, especially Mal and Shepherd. For SERENITY fans, I say, go for it, but for the rest of us, I say, beware: SERENITY, the movie, is not that much better than the TV series, which is saying something about the fine quality of the TV product."
1,Husband loved it,Totally violent and graphic. With Joss Whelen's sense of humor. All the men in the family loved it. But I just couldn't handle it
1,THAT TRAIN LONG TIME NOT COMIN',"Just based on what's here, it's a waste of money. Run time is identical to the original release; no extended or additional scenes restored to the body of the movie so why bother. Just talking heads. If it turns out otherwise, I'll update my review.Oh and I loved FIREFLY and SERENITY, I just want more of the movie!"
2,Disappointing Followup to a Great Series,"Okay, I know I'm in the minority here, and how blastphemous it is to say that something the great Joss Whedon did was sub-par, but really - this movie was NOWHERE near the quality of the series. The direction was sloppy, the script was overstuffed (clearly he was trying to force every idea he wasn't able to do on tv into the movie), the characters were treated poorly. And in the end, the swashbuckling element of FIREFLY was completely lost. For me - and again, this is my opinion, and I realize it's not everyone's - what made FIREFLY great was utterly abandoned. I felt like Whedon was pissed off at his creation and wanted to savage it.Not that the idea for the film was bad. Quite the contrary - the Reevers were one of the best things about the show, and getting into their story should have been great. But ultimately, I was sorely disappointed."
4,Very good but not great,"I own the Firefly box set, and have watched every episode in it several times. This is possibly the best sci-fi series of the past twenty years. I eagerly awaited Serenity, and hoped it would cause the series to be revived.Well, as soon as I saw the movie (on the first day) I knew it wasn't going to happen. The movie is a little too intense and frenetic for non-fans to follow, in my opinion. While it was fun (and I'm sure I'll pick up more details after watching the DVD a few times), I didn't come away thinking it was a classic by any means. So, four stars. There ya go, a Firefly fanboy who doesn't automatically give the movie five stars.Nonetheless, it would be great if the series came back. Isn't that what the SciFi Channel is for?"
4,"Good, but not great - Series pilot was better","Overall, this movie is good, but not great. I was a huge huge fan of the series, having just finished the DVD collection. The first two episodes were incredibly well done.The movie picks up, sorta, from where the series left off. Watching with my wife, who hadn't see the series, she was a bit lost, while I was a bit bored.Some of the dialect was somewhat out of place, as they didn't seem to go fully into the tounge like they did in the series. There were random moments of alien and western dialect that seemed out of place when there was so little of it.The actors seemed to be playing the same characters as the series, but were older, and perhaps better actors - which made the acting seem ...odd.If you liked the series, the movie is worth a watch. Don't get too excited though!"
3,A Pretty Good Film,This is a pretty good story with pretty good acting. Not great by any means and not as good as an average episode of Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek Deep Space Nine. Shows you how far down the Sci Fi movie franchise has fallen that some people think of this as a classic. Not a waste of money but it wouldn't hurt to wait to see it on cable either.
5,bringing things to a close,"The firefly series, in my opinion, is some of the best television i've seen. Unfortunately it was cancelled just as you begin to really care about the characters. I see the movie as an attempt to bring all the loose ends to a close. Another two or three tv series's would have made a better job of this, but that didn't seem to be an option. There is so much in the way of back story that was crying out to be told. A movie could never cover all this ground, but it did a pretty good job with the time it had. I'll just have to live with not knowing the preacher's story, or the many other questions not answered. I would not recommend seeing the movie unless you've watched at least the first few episodes of firefly."
5,HD-DVD version rocks!,"This is one of my favorite movies and I already owned the DVD, but I could not resist getting the HD-DVD to view on my 106 inch diagonal projection screen. At first, it did not look much better than the DVD version, but when I switched back and forth, the difference was obvious. The DVD looks blurry-like I'm watching without my glasses (or after too much Scotch). Differences in dark scenes are not as noticeable as bright scenes, but the HD version is still better. If you have not seen this movie-get it now! If you already own the DVD-get the HD-DVD ASAP!"
5,Buy it,Really fun entertaining movie and I had to buiy the DVD when it came out. the DVD was great too with LOTS of extras. I was not even aware of the Firefly series until I bought the DVD and now I have to get that too.
1,Avoid this turkey.,You know it is bad when it is released on DVD like 9 weeks after it is released in theaters! Talk about huge turn-around.This film is based on the Firefly TV show which failed miserably on network television. So some genius decides to make it into a feature length film with a huge budget and guess what... the film also fails miserably! Did the dingleberries not learn their lesson the first go-around?The part that is really frightening is the rabid fanbase who acted like a pack of lunatic hyenas trying to get people to see this. It seemed like the word subtle was not in their vocabulary and the end result was it kept even more people away.
1,A waste of money!,"I saw this movie in the theater with some friends of mine and while I was watching it I was so bored I thought I was going to fall asleep during the movie. I wasted nearly 2 hours and $6.50 that I can never get back! If I could I would give ""Serenity"" zero stars. My friends all liked this movie. I must have been the only one that didn't like it. Well that's all I'm going to say about this boring film. Gosh did this movie suck!!!"
1,"Watch it, but you will hate it","I saw this movie in theaters and i wanted to die. Watch it if you like, but it sucks.The acting was dreadful, and the plot was dumb.Thanks for listening"
1,Great Cure for an Insomniac,"This movie was soooooooooooooooo boring. If this was based on the TV series, I am glad it got canceled."
1,Catastrophe,"Unfortunately, I have seen Firefly/Serenity and it is awful. It is good that the series is canceled because it is an insult to SciFi genre.Whedon, just like Paul W.S. Anderson should be fired, and forbidden to write another script by law!Whedon decimated an excellent Alien series with Resurrection, and Anderson dumped it to the toilet after with AvP!I don't want to even mention Buffy or Angel - I don't know who watches that?So, lets go back to the Firefly/Serenity. Its awful, how can it be a SciFi if you: 1-don't have aliens, 2-don't have the technology, 3-have cowboys?!?!If you really want SciFi they you should watch ""Star Trek"", that WAS, IS and WILL BE the SciFi at its best.Unfortunately it seems that overall viewer intelligence drop sharply in the last few years, and now people watch Firefly/Serenity-like series.Muppet Show is more intelligent and fun."
2,Shadow of who they were,"These are not the characters from Firefly, especially Doctor Simon Tam. On top of that there are other inconsistencies between the show and the movie. The movie is a solid 3/5 stars for people who have never seen the TV show, but a 2/5 stars for people who like the the show."
3,Unexpected but flawed,I am a big fan of 'Firefly' and the excitement of seeing that universe come alive on the big screen was thrilling but 'Serenity' delivers as well as fails in what it sets out to do.The story has unexpected turns but the pacing and the story structure is flawed. The cast give an awesome performance again but only to loose out to non effective translation of the TV show's storytelling and mood onto the big screen.It is still good to see the story of 'Firely' come to some conclusion.
5,"Great Movie, But Outakes are Extremely Offensive!","A sci-fi movie for adults. It contains graphic violence, but the darkest scenes are softened with well-placed, incredibly funny wry humor. The characters interact incredibly well, and even the bad guy is made to be understood by the viewer. My greatest disappointment with the DVD was the outake section of the menu. The outakes were not only unfunny, but the actors responded by uttering the most vile profanities."
3,Not as good as series was,It doesn't live up to the series. The series is funnier + more entertaining. This movie seems rushed.It is a great action movie however. Seems like they crammed more action in and left out more of the story.
2,It not Fire Fly,"It's too bad they had to finish the Fire Fly series with a Horror Movie. It's great for a Sci Fi, blood and guts movie, but it destroys the enjoyment of the Fire Fly series. Watch Fire Fly. It is great. This does a great job of finishing the master plot of Fire Fly, but it has too much horror bagage with it. If a well edited version came out, then I'ld recommend it."
5,Good Stuff!,"Accidently discovered this one looking up sci-fi stuff and seeing the RPG. Bought the movie, watched with my wife, who isn't a sci-fi fan, and we both loved it. Great chemistry between the characters. Enjoyable.Bought FireFly the series the next day."
5,serenity,"loved this series, had the series on dvd, but needed the movie. Came in good time in good shape Thanks"
5,Outstanding creativity,"I had not seen Firefly before watching this movie, so I was unprepared for the crazy setting - an outlaw western version of space. I say crazy because before seeing the movie I would not have believed it possible to pull of such a scenario, but it worked very well. The plot itself was very good, and overall the movie was very entertaining but the most impressive aspect to me was simply the new and different take on space. Not having seen the TV shows, the characters did not mean much to me and I did not follow all of the subtleties of their interactions. I did later watch the Firefly series and then rewatch Serenity, that time around it was far more dramatic. Though still well worth watching without seeing Firefly."
5,Good Stuff,One of the more excellent films I have ever seen. It's a shame there was an end so early on to the tv series.
3,Good Storyline,"Movie may have been better in the theater, but has a good story line of survival in the future. A rag tag bunch of ""Wanderer's"" excuse the pun on my name. Action revolves around a girl and her ""special powers"". Ship captain is a Hans Solo wanna be.I do not regret buying it, but am not overly excited either."
4,Be sure to watch it after the series,"Firefly was cancelled prematurely, so it never had a chance to deliver a series finale (ala Mash, Friends, Sienfeld, etc.) This movie acts as that finale.Be sure to watch it after you watch the series.I suspect that people who watch it cold will have mixed feelings about it. There is very little preamble for the uninitiated. The writers wrote it with current fans in mind and simply used the relationships and characters they had built during the series.That said, if you watched the series, you must watch this to see how they summed it up."
4,A fitting end...if only the fans would accept it.,"Serenity is the film sequel to the single season of the television series Firefly. While knowledge of Firefly is not required, it's not a bad idea, as you gain a deeper appreciation for the characters. It is a unique vision of the future, and just enough grounded dialogue to keep the audience watching.This is, however, the final part of the saga. The story hints that there is a little hope for future tales, but (SPOILERS) several crew members are dead. (END SPOILERS) That shouldn't get your hopes up, though. On the business end, it was amazing that Serenity was even made, much less a sequel after its lackluster theatrical showing. Do not despair too much, though. It's a good ending, and a lot of closure is there.Overall, I think you'll like the film, and you'll probably enjoy the TV show. But let's not go nuts. The signal has stopped after this."
4,"Had never seen Firefly, but loved this movie","My husband and I saw the movie trailer for Serenity advertised on tv and decided to go see it in the theater. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie not just from a scifi perspective, but also the character development and the creativity employed in their language and culture. The message regarding the dangers of an oppressive government and the power of freely available information was interesting as well. After receiving the DVD off our Amazon Wish List and checking out the bonus material, I wasn't at all surprised to see that Joss Whedon was the mind behind the project and we were thrilled to learn that there was a related tv series called Firefly for which we have purchased the DVDs. Being a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, it makes perfect sense that this other brain child of Whedon's would be just as captivating. Although I'll definitely miss some of the characters that were killed off, I hope we'll see this cast again in future projects!"
2,"2 Stars for the DVD, 5 for the film.","What the heck is going on. now instead of releasing seasons or collectors edition. studios are released stripped down movies and episode mini-packs. Come On! i mean seriously, what is there to add to another Serenity dvd. last i checked there was a 2-disc collectors edition!Buy the Collectors Edition, its out, and i probably has more content."
4,"This is a good movie, fairly difficult to find.","I began looking for ""Serenity"" after I rented the entire ""Firefly"" series. I was beginning to feel frustrated because in my small town all we have is a Wal-Mart and they don't carry ""Serenity."" It was very convenient to pop online and order ""Serenity."" It arrived in about a week. The case was a little dented, but it was still wrapped in the celophane and the disk plays perfectly, so no worries, right?"
5,Best Sci-fi in a long time,"A truely wonderful film with great action, thrills, laughs, cries, scares, and the wittiest dialogue around.Enjoy, take the kids, and tell your friends."
5,"Fantastic film, excellent extras",I don't have a long review to give. I just wanted to say how excellent this movie is. HIGHLY recommend this blueray version.
4,Serenity,"The finishing touch to an enjoyable series. Fast paced, a light touch of humor, and poignancy. Able to stand alone movie, but much better if one has already seen the series or owns the series."
5,Good science fiction,"Most science fiction films over the last 10 years seem to be intended for kids under 12 or those with IQs under 80. But this oneis an exception. On top of tying up loose ends from the Firefly series, it`s a very good stand alone film. And it`s not justflash/bang special effects like most of the gunk put out by hollyweird over the last decade+. It has a good story and a decentplot. Sure it get a bit goofy in spots, but all in all it`s a very good film. Makes you think there might be some remote hopefor hollyweird yet."
5,Great Movie...Better than Star Wars!,"Loved this movie, total Blockbuster. It has everything, action, comedy, drama and when you hear about the story behind this film being made, you have even more drama.Not like any other Sci-Fi movie I have seen, its actually believable and you get totally immersed in the Serenity verse.I recommend this to anyone who loves action, comedy and of course Sci-Fi, you won't be disappointed. Also check out the series which is a prequel to the movie called 'Firefly' and search online for the fan websites, the story behind it is heartwarming, although tearjerking."
5,Serenity on Blu Ray rocks!,Well chances are if you purchased this than you have already seen SERENITY and more than once. So what is better than seeing it now in stunning Blu Ray? Thanks for finally bringing the Big Damn Movie to this format!
5,We may experience some slight turbulence and then explode,"When a movie starts with ""We may experience some slight turbulence and then explode"", well, you have to see it through, right?I never watched ""Firefly"", but bought this on a whim because of a tiny ""Wired"" magazine review. Thank God for tiny ""Wired"" magazine reviews, as this is one of the *GREAT* sci-fi movies I own.It's high-tech and human, with (ambiguous) saints and devils, and some of the great sci-fi lines. Just listen to Jayne describe his assorted bases for starting a fight. Hysterical!Lots of fun. Buy, watch, enjoy. Then spread the word."
5,"great story, super visual and sound great blu ray","i have always enjoyed the series and the talented cast of charactors. this story line is wonderful. nathan fillion needed acting lessons in this one. the best acting was from the always talented, adam baldwin..the blu ray picture is the best i've viewed on my old tv.sound from my old bose 321 rocked the action scenes."
5,Great Show,Special effects are stupendous! Action packed! One should also see/buy the Firefly series on dvd and watch the whole story.
5,Always a favorite,"Serenity was a wonderful wrap up to a series that was cut way too short unlike another Joss Whedon product that went a season or two too long, that being Buffy. I would much rather have seen the series continue with the movie becoming part of the story arc rather than the end of it but one can't have everything. As it is, I have the DVD and the video which I purchased separately to eventually download to my tablet."
5,Serenity is a must see!,"My husband and I saw Serenity this weekend. It was terrific. I think that if you have followed the TV series you'll, of course, have a better understanding and connection to each of the characters. But even if you don't have a clue, this movie absolutely stands on it's own merit.I've always like how Joss Whedon mixes the serious with a dash of humour when you least expect it.I'm sure you'll love this movie as much as we did. I hope this is the beginning of another new season on TV and movie sequel. Hey, why not wish for both."
5,Outstanding Movie,"I was a little concerned that the series and Wheadon's brand of wit\comedy would not translate well to the big screen. My worries turned out to be completely unfounded. The movie was a gem.Featuring intelligent dialogue and wonderfully developed characters, Serenity manages to make an interesting and fresh foray into a genre that has been victimized by mediocrity on so many occasions. Truly, Serenity proves that a great movie is first and foremost about the writing.A great script, wonderful acting, and outstanding direction make Serenity one the best sci-fi feature films of the past 2 decades. Highly recommended to all."
4,Can this be the end???,"For all of us Firefly freaks the movie helps to explain and tie up lose ends from the series. If you haven't watched the series the movie could be confusing. Also you may not be as invested in the characters as much and Serenity is definitely about the characters. Digital effects are awesome and the film clips along at a good pace ensuring no boredom. Overall the movie is good on it's own but I encourage people to view the series first...then the movie is great! Once you see both you'll be saying with pathos ""Can this be the end???"""
4,Films films films,"Fab, well worth watching if you liked the series, always funny and ingredibly enjoyable."
5,A good movie? The best this year? Of course. Duh!,"First, the other reviews are spot on. I can not add to their depth of coverage, so I will just add my small voice to the chorus. In my opinion, this movie is the best one released this year. Period. In any category, class, genre, you name it. Whatever the second best movie might be, is simply canine excrement to be scraped from the bottom of my shoe, in comparison (yes, I am pointing my finger at you, Mr. Lucas).Is the Serenity movie better than the Firefly series? Well, it is simply not possible to exceed that benchmark. But I will say that this movie is equal to the same high standards that Joss has established. The story, plot, writing, and acting are superb. The result is an experience that tickles all the emotions, so expect to laugh, cheer, and yes, bring some tissues too."
5,"OK, I'm hooked!","There is no structure in my life, no planning, I fell across this movie one night on cable quite by accident. I don't like a lot of things but I'm now hooked on Serenity AND the Firefly series. I bought this and then I bought the series and consider it money well spent. I don't by any means consider myself qualified to be a critic but watching this movie makes me happy and that's what movies are all about, yes?"
5,Amazing Story,"I loved this movie! It was a great tribute to the show. Firefly remains one of the most original TV shows I remember to date, and am very sad to see it go. Perhaps there will be other incarnations of this series/movie!"
3,Wasn't what I thought.......,"Some parts made sense, but other I didn't grasp (to be honest I think it was just me). I think this movie is more for the younger generation."
5,"Great Movie, Decent Collector's Edition","The movie is great. It's a fun, exciting sci-fi spectacular that's a must watch for any Firefly fan yet still accessible to those that have never seen the TV show. The distinct western feel, interesting dialect, and the quirks of the characters sets this apart from many other contemporary sci-fi movies.If you already own the original Serenity DVD there isn't much point in getting this Collector's Edition DVD. The packaging is nice and there are some extras, but the extras aren't momentous enough to justify purchasing the movie again if you already own it. On the other hand if you don't already own Serenity then you might as well dish out the couple bucks extra and get this over the original DVD."
5,An exceptional show!,"This is truly an exceptional movie following an exceptional show. The storyline and characters have no competitors what so ever. I don't know what were the reasons to cancel the show, but there are plenty of reasons to get it restarted now. I truly hope that Joss Whedon somehow finds a way to continue with this project. Buy the DVD set and the movie. It'll leave you wanting more and make an instant fan out of anyone who watches them."
4,Nice addition to movie library,"I like this movie a lot, even though I only saw about one-third of the television series episodes of ""Firefly,"" on which the movie is based. The series translated to the big screen quite well. Quality of video/sound is excellent, and the DVD has lots of nice extras, including director's commentary. Without revealing any spoilers, the plot revolves around a big secret which the Alliance (which rules most of the galaxy) strongly wishes to keep secret. A passenger on the ship may have the key to this secret buried deep within her subconscious. Thus, an assassin from the Alliance is in pursuit...Lots of action, good acting, nice FX, poignancy. Worth the price!"
5,An Original Cult Classic,"Joss Whedon never did get the recognition he deserved (until his most recent film, The Avengers), especially during the duration of one of his greatest pieces of work, Firefly, which was unjustly taken off the air. Firefly finally gets its smashing finish fans were praying for, in this hip, humorous, and triumphant movie adaptation, Serenity. Not only is it every bit as good as fans could ever want it to be, it's also easy enough for the novice to get into. With breakneck pacing, cool visuals, an attractive cast, a hilarious script, Whedon's knack for action choreography, and a story made for all to enjoy (not just the Firefly elitists), Serenity is a joy to watch."
3,looks like a tv pilot and guess what...,"No, I did not watch Firefly, but I love scifi. I rented this on word of mouth, and did not know it was linked to a TV series. This fact is very obvious though, as the movie looks like an installment of a series. I was surprised it was ever released in theatres, as it feels straight to dvd (lost $15 million in release).In the future, 2 factions govern man's fate, including a totalitarian regime, that seeks to alter human behavior chemically. The flashbacks of a conditioned/programmed teen girl 'Firefly' are very interesting, as the mystery of a secret society is revealed. Social engineering gone awry is not a new theme to scifi, but this movie stays interesting even with mediocre effects and poor acting."
1,sound wont work,"I dont know why but the sound wont work for me with this movie!I have other blu-ray movies and my sound sytem works fine them, I am very disappointed!"
2,"Oh, i didn't really care for this","I never saw the TV show, but i never much liked Whedon's Buffy either, and this movie (and the tv show too i presume) had the same level of humor. The whole Western/Sci-fi theme, while fairly unique, just didn't work for me. And the little skinny girl going ballistic on Reavers was completely ridiculous, not to mention Reavers being able to pilot sophisticated starships when they're supposed to be some kind of irrational madmen!This was just a silly TV movie somehow - SOMEHOW - elevated to feature film status. It wasn't bad per say, but i really don't want to see it again. At least Phantom Menace had some cool lightsaber fights..."
2,"Learn to write, learn to act, learn to speak Mandarin","Lousy tongue-in-cheek script, unconvincing cardboard characters, reheated crook-with-a-golden-heart story. If you like Sci-Fi, try Battlestar Galactica instead to see how adults write and act.And please hire a decent tutor to stop the actors from mangling their Mandarin Chinese lines, or better yet, get a first year student of Mandarin to dub them."
1,SCI FI Flop!,"Having brought this DVD expecting an exciting new SCI FI flick I was bitterly disappointed. Having never seen the Firefly series and being advised by friends that I should, I went on to buy the DVD to see what the fuss was about. Big mistake, the acting was wooden and the details of character were so bad you didn't really care if the good guys won but worst of the entire plot was appalling. I would not recommend this film if you have not already seen the Firefly series, in fact I would not recommend this film unless you were born with a paper bag over your head."
2,Boring!,"The movie script makes use of psychobabble and talk of behavior modification which at times is unique for a sci-fi movie. The acting and plot is lacking in enthusiasm or creativity. I found this movie to be boring. I am a fan of Lynch's Dune, Bladerunner, and Farscape in case you were wondering about my tastes."
1,What's with all the five star reviews?,Did we see the same movie? Talk about cliches. The Mal characterwas a composite of Han Solo who was a cliche to begin with. Thisis a really bad movie. I've never been so bored watching a movie.
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!,"Anybody want a used copy of this bummer? I have it listed here for $13, and only played once. Very boring. Lame, and hard to follow. Anybody who rates this as an excellent movie-----Well lets just say it doesn't take much to amuse them. I love a good sci fi, action/adventure. Although the special effects were great, it isn't enough to make me want to watch this movie more than once. If you want real good sci fi watch the Star Wars Saga's."
2,HD-DVD only has DD+ sound. :(,HD-DVD only has DD+ sound. :(Why is it that Amazon doesn't provide a *large/detailed* pic of the backside of every HD (Blu-ray included) movie?Fortunately they (or a user?) did.The regular DVD has DTS 5.1 sound. :)
3,Mediocre movie and mediocre service by Amazon,"I saw the series on science channel and bought it. The series were great. The movie had too many changes to be similar enough to the series and it felt like they had to make it more mainstream to appeal to more audience, although I feel it wasn't good enough for people that didn't watch the series and it was too far off the series for people that did watch the series.Still, it's more of Firefly where it was shut down and I still love this show.The box was damaged when I received it unfortunately. The plastic thing in the middle that is supposed to hold the disc in place was broken off which caused the dvd to move inside the box while it was being shipped and this damaged the dvd to the point that it's not fluent anymore on my dvd player. And that's a little disappointing for my first Amazon purchase."
4,Good experience,"The mnovie is ok, if you like scifi and fantasy movies. It is simple and entretained."
4,Good movie - lots of extras,"I was really sad to see this show get cancelled, and sadder still to see a couple of its' main characters get killed off in the movie. But it's a nice collection of extras, and a fine finish to a well made, short-lived series."
5,A step above the television show in quality,"This is a great movie, though you will only fully understand it if you've watche the television series. The television series is great, but seems to push too many boundaries of good taste and morals (not for kids)and it's understandable why the series was canceled.Even with the problems the series had, it was quite enjoyable and kept you entertained from start to finish. The movie is a great wrap-up and explains a lot that you missed from the television show. The movie also relies on the fact that you should already know a lot of the history and understand the characters from the television series. The two really do go hand in hand.Bottom line: Watch the television series and then wrap up with the movie. Very entertaining.*The HD-DVD version of this is very nice and clear. I'm very pleased with the quality of of the video."
3,TV series was better,"They could have made sure of sequel or at least tried to save the series with a better movie. Killing off two major characters only told me that the director was done with trying to resurrect or do the series any justice. Just like the TV series, another opportunity just blown to bits. It could have actually been a great movie, but for some reason the director/writers just blew it.Mel did not behave at all like the character in the TV series. It took a long time to develop those characters, but the movie simply ignored all of that. Too bad."
2,Joss can do better then this,"Not as good as the show, although if you've loved the show then you should really get the graphic novel. The movie was made for newcomers who would may have knew nothing about the show firefly. Therefore it is not as great as it could have been what Joss should have done is made it for fans instead of trying to make it for new comers but ... I can't complain about what has already been done."
2,"Nice, but...","I love the TV show Firefly. It was such a unique take on humanity's future with the combination of space travel, intermixed with the morals of the Old West.It seems to me that science fiction fans (and I am one of them) are very loyal and aware of the history of the characters and the rules of the environment (see Light Sabers in Star Wars). Sadly, Serenity changed some of the events of the TV series. Although I am not happy about the changes I am a big fan of the movie.While I hope all Firefly fans will buy the Collector's Edition to support more tales of the crew of Serenity, there is nothing truly new on the second disc."
4,Honest assessment,"I was dying to get more Firefly, and although I still think the series was the cat's meow, the movie fell short of my expectations. It felt like it was 4 years worth of series action/reveals jam packed into one film. It was far darker than the series, without the witty reparte that made the series so phenomenal.It was nice having some closure, but the cost was a loss of the greatness."
5,Serenity (TV Series Firefly movie),This movie was made after the series Firefly aired. The dvd was in perfect condition - just as described by the seller. It arrived very quickly. I would definitely buy from this seller in the future.
5,A really great film,"I find that I am difficult to please when it comes to major motion pictures. Most of the time, I leave the theater disappointed or let-down. There's always something that just does not work for me.Serenity is an exception. This is a movie that gets better with each watching. I loved Firefly and this film was a fitting, big-screen version that extended the story into new places.Thanks to Joss Whedon, thanks to the spectacular cast -- sparkling performances across the board -- and thanks to Universal for taking a chance. We Browncoats will continue to support this franchise for a long time to come.Now, can we please have our sequel? :)"
5,You decide!,"This movie is based on a short lived SiFi series that generated quit a following. After watching the movie you will probably wonder why it was canceled. To tell the truth I have been wondering about that since the series was canceled. I do not have cable and the series that was competing with it stunk (both where late night), but some how this one was canceled and the other one continued on (what a drag). Watch an enjoy for this is probably the last time we will get to view this reality."
4,Rent Firefly before watching and this movie to understand fully.,My gf and I watched the Firefly series and really loved the characters. It took me a bit to warm up to new actors like Nathan Fillion and Morena Baccarin but they aquitted themselves nicely. I'm saddened that the show did not survive Fox's budget cuts but I'm so glad they were able to make this movie. None of the actors disappoint. The only part is that the interplay between the actors is limited as this is a 2hr movie and not a series but in the end the chemistry is there in this movie. You don't have to watch the Firefly series but it certainly helps.Chiwetal Ejiofor is a nice newcomer here and plays a nice villian. I like to see the range this actor has. The HD DVD version looks fantastic it's surely going to be a show off disc for many of you. Enjoy
5,Closure is good!,"I was glad to be able to have closure to the TV series Firefly! Joss Whedon scores a touch down with me once again. All I have to hear is his name associated with a project, and I get right on board with having to see it! If you are not a fan of his, you should be!!"
5,great movie,the best futuristic movie. characters all are great and real. I first started watching Firefly and got hooked. very disappointed it was canceled. why is crap left on tv and good ones canceled? I would buy another one if another movie about Serenity was made.
5,the real deal,"A worthy finale for the TV show. How can the networks and studios not realize that they have a Star Trek level phenomenon here? Not to compare, but in terms of underground fan base building from a short lived TV series. I still want the TV show back!!"
4,Definitely worth the price of admission!,"Of course, being a fan of the short-lived TV series, perhaps my opinion is biased. Still, this movie is one of those genre-bending, fast-paced quirky films that appeal to many types of people on many types of levels.With top-notch special effects, the sci-fi buffs get a good taste of a possible future--not the traditional Star Wars/Star Trek ultra-hi-tech, all-is-good world. It's 500 years in the future, and yes, there are still no aliens! Get over it.Western fans can really appreciate the witty banter, gun-slingin' action, and quite impressive fight choreography.There's enough romance to entertain the ladies; the characters are fresh, exciting, flawed and dedicated. The actors are top-notch, if not well known, and bring a fresh look into a new world.The network might have made a mistake in canceling the show, but you don't have to make a mistake by missing this movie. Check it out."
3,Ok movie but save until you have watched all the four stars!,"Acting and direction are thin but special effects and continuity are good enough to keep the story moving along. Falls between awful Starship Gallactica and juvenile early Star Wars movies. Lead character is not much of an actor - have to be dozens who would have brought much more to the screen. Poor development of character for ""the ultimate weapon"". A waif Matrix type. More i think about it the more problems i find with the movie. Still, digestable if there is nothing else you can find."
1,Video rental doesn't work with Linux.,Amazon is generally great for buying physical products. I use Linux exclusively on my desktop machines. The digital download services such as mp3 download and movie rental seem to fail rather consistently right across the board. I have given up on any cloud service Amazon offers.
5,Revived dead show,"This movie was made after the TV show was canceled, which really says something about the fans and the crew. Once a show is killed off, it usually stays dead, but due to this show's massive following and fan support, Whedon was allowed to make his movie.Great flic, but I'd recommend watching the Firefly series first."
4,Great movie,"We appreciated them making this movie after cutting off the show prematurely. Amazing movie, but not too great watching it they Amazon"
5,Can I give it 10 stars - it is off the charts,Serenity is a must have for Firefly fans. Even if you never saw a Firefly episode you'll still love the movie if you are a sci-fi fan. It is great!
4,"Basically a good review, but with some caveats","A friend had given me the plain edition of Serenity knowing I loved all things Whedon, so I didn't mind paying for the souped up edition. However, I shouldn't have bothered. Not that the extras aren't fine, but they aren't worth a second purchase if you already have the original. Nonetheless, it's still a remarkable pleasure to watch any version of this film."
4,Love,"Great conclusion to a series I didn't discover until it had already been off the air for several years (great job, marketing department)."
4,Serenity is surreal.,"Serenity concludes and wraps up of most of the story lines from the show Firefly. It also explains some of the premises the show was based on. If you are a fan of the show, as I am, you will like this, but it could have been a little more inclusive, as Ron Glass's Preacher is never completely explained. There is a hook at the end for a sequel. It has the same feel and action in a longer format, so more development of plot and characters are possible. The added discs provide even more insight and behind-the-scenes looks. This is a must have, if you have the Firefly series. Overall, I still want more Nathan, so I watch Castle for my fix and almost anything the other actors are in. Enjoy."
4,Compelling,"I had not a chance to see the ""Firefly"" television series, but I did enjoy Joss Whedon's interpretation of the X-men comic series and so I thought I'd give this movie a try. I like Whedon's use of dialogue to build and relieve tension in X-men, and he maintains his ear for good witty dialogue in ""Serenity."" He also does an excellent job of developing what are essentially comic book characters, and making us care about them and so that when this movie reaches its climax our muscles tense up as we root for our heroes to make it against overwhelming odds.That said, the special effects are really cheesy -- I suppose it's a homage to the campiness of Whedon's style."
5,worth the replacement cost,"The movie, like the series, has a gemlike quality - polished and perfect. It's almost alarming to see the extended scenes and realize how much worse they are. The final versions are a real tribute to the power of judicious editing. And I would buy the entire series all over again if Nathan did the commentaries."
5,Finally affordable,"I've waited for this movie on Blu ray forever. I went to the movies to see it, and w/ my home set up now, it's the cats a$$. I've kept track of all the actors, and many of them are doing well, especially Fillion. I've seen it so many times, my wife won't watch it w/me anymore !"
5,Awesome Movie!!,"Ok, you REALLY need to see the series before you watch this movie...but it was the best thing Joss Whedon ever created, so you are missing out on an excellent series if you haven't!! This movie was a perfect conclusion to a really outstanding show. I loved the series (you can probably tell) and this movie helped tie most everything together. Even if you never watched a single episode, you can still appreciate this movie on it's own as a great story with some incredible characters. I have only scratched the surface of the extras included on the Blu-Ray, but they are really cool to a fan like me. BROWN COATS UNITE!!! BUY THIS MOVIE!!!"
5,brown coats rock,"I am new to this whole phenomenon as of this last month when I got the movie through net flix. after watching the film with no back ground about the series or the characters, I have to say I loved the movie. I proceeded to pick up the series on DVD and thought it was on the level of the movie... this is a great story altogether. If you haven't given firefly/serinity a chance now is the time to get on board. allthough I would suggest watching the 12 episodes from fire fly 1st. Good luck, I know you will enjoy this!!!"
5,Not the end,"The movie picks up only months after the last chapter of the series, which helps to maintain the continuity of the story arc. Some of the crew have left; Shepherd Book is now running a commune, Inara is teaching at the ""Companion"" training school. But the major plot is that the Alliance wants River Tam in the worse way, and has sent an assassin to find her. He will stop at nothing to obtain his prize. I won't give away too much, but I will put it this way, River does possess some serious skills when threatened.To fully appreciate the last 1/3 of the movie, you should watch ALL of the series. You will understand.Contrary to what other reviewers have stated, this isn't the end. Joss Whedon wants to make more big-screen chapters of Firefly. He is busy right now working on Wonder Woman, but plans on returning to the good ship Serenity."
5,better than the TV show,"I thought the TV show Firefly was good but not great. Serenity however rates a ""great"" on my personal scale. Although it builds on the same characters that were in the show, you should still be able to catch on if you've never seen it. (Although if you have, it probably makes more sense as you're able to reconnect with the characters much quicker).The story is inventive, interesting, and captivating. It also answers a few unanswered mysteries from the TV show, so if you were a fan of firefly, you'll want to watch the movie for that aspect at the very least."
5,f.han,"If you liked Firefly you may love this movie or you may not love this movie. I loved Firefly and I loved this movie. My recommendation, watch Firefly first and then watch the movie. My husband was a Firefly fan and I was skeptical because I'm not a huge sci-fi lover, but both Firefly and Serenity were awesome! Great story! Really artistic! Great characters! Great acting! I really loved both! Again, buy Firefly first and watch the series...then by Serenity. You'll be glad you did!"
5,"Serenity has caused me to watch ""Firefly"".","I know I did this backwards: I wasn't really aware of ""Firefly"". Then I saw ""Serenity""... and now I'm watching the ""Firefly"" episodes."
4,Best space opera ever!,"Firefly is a beautifully written, beautifully produced and even more skillfully delivered story. The themes can be traced back to the most basic human conflicts while at the same time delivering an environment which has never been seen on television or film. ""It's just another space western"" is the first instinct but at closer review the audience will realize that the characters spring into life as a fully developed family dealing with social and personal conflicts in each episode. The writing creates a universe where it is a daily chores to fly through space and dock with exotic planets. At the same time the captain deals with marauding ""space raiders"" and a powerful and controlling central government he must also balance the needs of his crew while they deal with love and jealousy. A MUST SEE for any sci-fi fan and a should see for any student of literature."
4,Wrapping up loose ends,"""Firefly"" was a great series. ""Serenity"" is a quality movie that stands on it's own, but helps wrap up most of the loose ends from the series. Thank goodness we weren't left dangling in mid air as we were by the X-Files series.The boxed set extras contain useful and entertaining extra content that Firefly fans would appreciate."
4,Great flick!,"This DVD contains a lot of extras that, if you loved Firefly, are very interesting. The movie itself was a good way to end an unfortunately shortlived series and was suspenseful and revealing about several of the characters. If you just have to know what happens to the Firefly crew this is the movie to watch."
5,serenity (what a movie),"this is a great spinoff from firefly the series. I took a friend to see it who had never seen firefly, now they want to see the series.hope this is to become a franchise, we need more great scfi"
5,Loved it...,"I've never seen the television series Firefly everyone is talking about, but, I found this movie to be very interesting.I would say it's similar to star wars without the light swords. The human race doesn't exist only on earth. There is a galactic alliance and the government is training human children to be the ""perfect weapon"" using brainwashing and mind control. One girl is rescued by her brother who breaks in to save her only to find they would spend much of their life running from an assassin. What does this girl know that the government is trying to hide? Can they make it to the outer planet without getting attacked and eaten alive by the human consuming reevers? Will her secret be exposed for the whole world to know the truth? Watch and see...it really is a good movie. (Serenity is the name of the ship.)"
5,Wonderful End To Too Short a Run,"Whether a fan of the series ""Firefly"" or not, this film made strides for the realism of sci-fi for years to come. Whedon's farewell to the short-running series was as much a eulogy for what should have been a huge hit as it was a masterpiece of science fiction film. Exciting, mysterious, and containing action sequences that rival the ""video game"" movies that plague the screen today, without losing the familial chemistry of the cast nor the humor that was such a large part of the ""Firefly"" television series. Still a favorite after ten years."
4,Good movie but watch series first,"I watched this movie several years ago having never seen its progenitor, the Firefly series. At the time I probably would have rated it a 3. The movie was decent enough, but I could tell I was missing a lot of backstory and therefore I found it hard to become involved. It was clear that I was supposed to care deeply about characters that the movie alone hadn't really made me care about. To be honest, it didn't hold my attention much.A couple months back I found that the series was on Amazon Prime. I watched it and then rewatched the movie, and whaddaya know, with the character backstories in place the movie was gripping and emotionally charged. I'm not the first reviewer to say this, but if you're going to watch Serenity you are really doing yourself a disservice by not watching the Firefly series first.I rate the movie lower than five because I really don't think it stands on its own very well, but greater than three because it is an excellent capstone to the saga."
4,Tense. Compelling. Exciting.,"I watched the Firefly series first, then Serenity, so that everything would be in order. The action is quite exciting and I felt very tense waiting to see how things would turn out in the end. Full of heart. Some sad bits, but very good film."
4,Very good - and very intense,"The movie is very good, just like the TV show Firefly. However, I found the movie to be very intense, just like the TV show. It was difficult for me to tolerate it. I still recommend it, though; I'm just a sensitive person."
5,An excellent movie in its own right,"Yes, it has been mentioned quite frequently in the press that Serenity is a follow-up to the cancelled Firefly series, but I think more emphasis needs to be put on the fact that this is a stand alone movie, and quite a good one at that. A lot of the people I've talked to that have seen it had never heard of Firefly before a week ago, and they all agree that it is a fantastic movie. To me, it had all of the right ingredients that made me a fan of the series in the first place: action, humor, and most importantly, character development (something that movies nowadays seem to lack in abundance). The script is top notch, peppered with Joss Whedon's quirky trademark dialogue, and the acting is A+. Don't let the fact that there are no ""BIG NAME"" stars in this movie sway you - Serenity is a treat from start to finish, and has the potential to be the next Star Wars if given a chance."
5,A fitting follow-up to Firefly,"I loved the series, and loved the movie. This is about the most interesting science fiction concept that I have found on TV or movies. I recommend it to anyone who loves speculative fiction."
5,Serenity is AMAZING!,"The first movie to come along in years that is truly quality. Great story, characters, performances, effects, script, direction!!!! YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE FIREFLY TO UNDERSTAND AND LOVE THIS MOVIE. I went into it without even knowing about Firefly and I loved it. This story begs to be told in many more sequels!"
4,Serenity,After watching this movie I remembered seeing it on TV in the past.. It is a good movie with action and suspense.
3,"Good to Excellent, but too much violence","Chose this rating because too violent.Watched season one and so wanted to watch the movie. Some violence in the first season, but movie was overboard.Enjoyed the action and the finality and closure with Alliance."
5,"Cracking film, give it a shot","I'll keep this short, i'm not a sci-fi fan in the slightest. I don't watch any programmes which have the words Star or Space somewhere in the title and as for Star Wars, I'd rather stick hot needles dipped in chilli sauce in my eyes for two hours than give that movie the time of day. When I went to see Serenity, I had'nt heard anything about it. I was bored on my day off and there was nothing else on so I gave Serenity a shot and I was pleasently surprised. This turned out to be a cracking movie and is now the only sci-fi dvd in my collection which includes over 300 movies! So, if you are a fan of sci-fi, you are going to love this movie and if like me you are not much of a sci-fi fan, I still highly recommend you give Serenity a shot, you just might find yourself enjoying it. Lets have a sequel please!!"
4,Serenity Now!,"I wish firefly had kept going. I am a big fan of Joss Wheaton I only discovered this show on Amazon. I wish I had seen the episodes for this show while it was on the air. I have a strong feeling that this cast and story line would have been as big a hit as Star trek in its time. If only there had been a way of getting it launched biggeer into the public eye. There are so many people who love Buffy,Angel,Doll house and watch them repeatedly as strange new fun. The color, picture and volume though out was great. I enjoyed it all I will not spoil the delight in watching this movie for anyone else but its worth owning and sharing with friends on movie night!!"
5,Ended too soon,"Well made, and excellent acting. A joy to watch with an immersive story line. One word to summ it up ""Shiny"""
4,"Swashbuckling, space-monkey fun","Why is this so great, and why are all the recent Stah Wahs flicks so lame? It's all in the characters, Mistah Lucas...all the relationships are so carefully delineated in ""Serenity"", that you actually care what happens to all the denizens of the old junker firefly...that, capped with great dialogue, thrilling action and stunts and plot elements that don't all center around board meetings, makes for some mighty thrilling, whiz bang entertainment!"
5,Awesome movie,What a great movie! Shows you the kind of genius Joss Whedon really is!The film is 8 years old and sure didn`t have a huge modern-day blockbuster budget......But it still is one of the best Sci-Fi feature-films of the recent years.MUST BUY for any Sci-Fi fan!
4,Lucas take note...,"This is how a sci-fi adventure should be. The lines are crisp, the action is great, the back-story helps establish the movie's environment, the CGI is effective and used wisely (meaning that we don't have old men doing back flips just to skip using the stairs and actors are not surrounded by awful CGI environments), and the acting is good for the kinda movie it is.What kinda of movie is it? FUN like Star Wars was, The Thing was, Body Snatchers was, and the countless other movies that helped establish the genre from the '50's and on. And just for note Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and it's series), Angel, and Fire Fly (which is the basis for this movie) also created Toy Story and yes wrote Alien Resurrection, which he still says what you saw on the screen WAS NOT what he wrote... my point they were FUN, this is TOO!This is where the future of the genre should go... I for one hope Universal will allow this to become a franchise series, it is worth it."
5,Happy with the purchase.,I almost don't have to put it in the dvd player. I have scene the movie so many times I can practically see the movie just holding it in my hand.
4,"This movie, you guys...","All of the feels.Okay, so basically, this is spoiler-free, but still gives you an idea of how good it is.On a scale of Dinotopia to Pulp Fiction, this is a ""WTF, JOSS WHEDON IS FREAKING AWESOME WHY ARE YOU RATING THIS ANYTHING BUT A FIVE""I disliked the ending...not the, well, death of a certain person, but the frenzied climax of the fight. It seemed a bit forced in its resolution. HOWEVER, there is no reason at all ever in this world that you should not watch this.Fair warning, this movie is the sequel to the show Firefly. Watch the show first, or else you will NOT get what happens in this movie, and you will think it is dumb."
5,A Must for Firefly Fans,I was so disappointed that Firefly was cancelled. So many unanswered questions. But Serenity wraps most of it up considering they had a limited amount of time. Well worth your time if you're a fan of the series.
5,"Great Series, Great Movie","I've seen this movie twice, with friends who were Firefly fans and with total newcomers to the story. Every one of them has come away saying ""what a great movie"". The reason is not complicated, it's just that with all the big budget effects and action sequences that are part of the standard package these days, we've forgotten how satisfying a movie can be when it has an ensemble of characters we care about and a story which is well written and well acted. Serenity does have the ""fun factor"" of a rollicking sci-fi adventure yarn, the sort of feel Star Wars used to have, but it also has a depth that leaves you well satisfied and keen to go right back in and see it all again.The DVD extras are a bonus, and whilst I'd like to see more of them, any shortcomings here aren't nearly enough reason to reduce a full 5/5 score for this particular movie."
5,If you like the show,"This movie is a must for anyone who loved the show. Considering how many few episodes there were, you really do have to get this."
4,Frirefly Fan,If you are a Firefly fan then this is a must have film. Great in HD on the space scenes. Good acting and give the Firefly series closure.
5,Really enjoyable movie,"I agree with a lot of the posters here about the movie not being up to par with the DVD series. However, that's an unfair comparison. With a year long TV series, you are really able to get into it. You grow with it, and it can become something more than just a show. It becomes personal, and you can really feel and understand the characters. With a movie, you really only have about two hours to pack all of this feeling and emotion into the production. That's a very hard task. However, I think that Joss did a great job with that aspect of it, and, as movies go, this one ROCKS!! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think that the average movie-goer will to. It's a very exciting film that evokes a lot of different emotion. I highly recommend it.If you haven't seen it already, I also recommend the Firefly DVD series. It's simply fantastic, and it will give you a better understanding of the movie and its characters."
5,The best in Sci-Fi,"This movie was done perfectly from start to finishMake a movieMake one season of the show (Firefly) on TV building up to the movieAir the movie in theatersAnd stopNo sequels, no specials, nothingI watch the show now and then (I don't want to get tired of it) and enjoy it every timeUnique story line and interesting charactersTen stars!"
5,Perfect Sci-Fi,"This movie is hilarious as well as thrilling. I was not prepared (due to the slight humor of the characters) for the ending, which was as amazing as any movie with the best actors, directors and such of today."
3,OK movie,I didn't care that much for this movie. I did watch it before watching Firefly. Thought the acting and general program was better in Firefly.
4,"Double dipping isn't cool, but this DVD has so much cool stuff!","When I first heard they were coming out with another DVD for Serenity, I was mad. Double dipping with DVDs is just not a cool aspect of capitalism. Anyway, my brother is obsessed with this movie, so I got this special edition, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has everything from the first DVD release, plus a new commentary with the actors and Joss, as well as lots of new featurettes! This is worth it, but I wish they would have told us before we got the first edition!"
5,Now for the sequel....,"I loved the show and the movie so now watching the deleted scenes and getting the background information (which were amazing, BTW) I just have to say this: ""Joss push for a sequel!"" I know that this will never happen, but I can dream. Or I can really genie it and hope that the SciFi channel will come to its senses and re-up this show. Ah yes, back to Firefly.Anyone who even liked the show has to get this version of the movie! It is a must have for any DVD collection. And don't forget to watch it with the commentaries on."
4,Fantastic sci-fi adventure!,"I would not consider myself a ""fan"" of the TV series ""Firefly"" (I saw several epsiodes when Fox first aired the show, and enjoyed it, but haven't seen the entire season), but I do enjoy Joss Wheadon's style, so I figured that I would enjoy ""Serenity"".I was not disappointed. Fun special effects and great space combat. A good time and well worth checking out."
5,How do folks not know about Firefly / Serenity ?,"This film and this DVD presentation is so fantastic, as everything from Joss Whedon has been. It never ceases to amaze me that with so many Sci-Fi fans, and fans of just plain great story telling, there are out there that don't know about Firefly. The DVD iteself is full of everything I want as a film / TV fan, and I've used it to turn people onto this amazing world. Not to push sales onto folks, but it's totally worth it to get both the film and TV show, you'll be looking for the other if you get one anyway.It's simply that good."
5,LR Browncoat,What can I say? Ditto. I love this movie and the series Firefly. Is it possible to wear a DVD out by playing it over and over?
5,"Brilliant, Vivid, Awesome","I didn't know I could still find new details in ""Serenity."" But the Blu-Ray edition of the film is really that clear and crisp. No synopsis here, but kudos for Joss Whedon, Zoic (who did the visual effects), and of course the whole cast. The story is involving, and the characters, in spite of being far removed from our world, are strong and believable. And there is a LOT of action! See it. On Blu-Ray. You'll be impressed while you're being entertained."
5,Excellent,"I just discovered Firefly and Serenity and boy, do I wish I had found them earlier. This movie is a fitting big-screen chapter to the series. One does not have to have seen the series to enjoy the film, although having some knowledge of the characters might help a bit.Great acting, funny dialogue, and very touching ending. Far better than the Star Wars prequels. I hope they make some sequels to this film -- it deserves it."
4,Peace Be With You Always,"Just some more friendly advice from the Observant Hermit Crab: Do yourself a favor and watch the T.V. series Firefly before you watch this movie. Otherwise, I think you will be lost within the first ten minutes. Peace be with you always!"
2,Disappointed...,"I loved Firefly, but I found this movie to be quite disappointing. It was definitely weaker than any of the episodes from the series."
1,HYPE!,"Oh my God what is wrong with you people? 4*?! This movie was so boring. I give 1* for the FX, that's it."
1,Positive reviews fooled me,"I wasn't going to watch this. Joss Whedon had a huge loyal fan base for Buffy: he abandoned his fans at the end, giving us about a year and a half of ruination of what had been a really good story. I swore I would never watch a Whedon production again. But it has been a long time, there was nothing else promising available, and the reviews looked good. Boy, did I get suckered.This movie was not only poorly scripted with plot holes you could drive a Semi through, but it was also a thin propeganda film. The major plot point, around which all the others revolved, was a young woman begging to be forgiven for trying to make people better. Oh, please, Mr. Cowboy, save us from the nanny state.As to Joss being a feminist, puh-leez. He 'creates' stereotypical male charecters and then puts boobs and long hair on them. He wouldn't recognize feminist epistemology if it bit him on the nose.If you MUST watch this sorry excuse for a movie, please rent, don't buy."
1,Firmware Trouble Strikes Again,"This is NOT a review of the movie itself. The movie is great.I am not sure how the producers of Blu Ray expect us to continue like this. I have owned my Blu Ray player for a little over a year now and I upgraded my firmware twice due to not being able to watch a new release movie. I just upgraded the firmware last about a month ago. Now, one versioni later was released mid December and I can't watch this new release. My Sony player starts the loading process and then powers down and restarts again."
1,Are they for real!,"I really wanted to like this film, but as I was watching it the movie became more and more unwatchable. Here are things that I did not like about the film:Spoilers!1. The dialog in this film was just terrible!2. Good guys just went back and forth from the same planets.3. Girl name River was annoying and walked around like a zombie. Also, she sometimes went into some martial arts moves and killed off all the deformed looking bad guys.4. Ending was laughable!I don't have much time to write this, so I hope that my review was helpful."
1,Could not get any worse!,"I liked how the movie started and that's about it. I could not believe just how boring this film was! The reviewer ""Can't believe some people"" should not have critized others like the way she did. My friend, who is an english major pointed out that they were lot of errors in her sentences. She should have just made her point and left at that. Bottom line, you may like this movie if you liked the t.v. show Fire Fly."
3,Ok product,"This flat iron spray is a great deal. However, it left my hair really greasy and I would not over spray or anything and I also felt like it was not doing anything. If you want to save money I recommend it, if you are looking for high quality, you should keep looking."
4,Typical Representation of tunes of the period.,"I believe that if the listener pays attention, he or she will discover many melodies still popular today, &used in TV commercials, movies and such. The listener should make an attempt to discover the lyrics of as many songs as possible here, say on youtube and will attain much greater enjoyment from them."
3,Good basic kitchen primer,"This is a good basic book, but my main ""beef"" with this book is that it uses too many Processed,packaged foods, For instance, in the section on cakes, the author calls for using yellow box mix as one of the ingredients. I prefer to make a ckae from scratch."
2,not that good,"if you buy all the vampire books , hold off on buying these until you are desperate. was an ok book, newer outlook but not that new. author has the skill to write much better i think"
2,Save the money!,"I read this book after reading Celebration, USA by Douglas Franz and Catherine Collins. The Celebration Chronicles is not worth the money. Mr. Ross has written a ""scholarly"" work which manages to examine Celebration at arm's length. Mr. Ross obtaining an apartment in Celebration, a community he clearly has no vested interest in, does not qualify as being a truly involved resident of a newly created, struggling community. Franz and Collins give much better insight, mostly because they have invested in a home and are truly involved in the growth of the community.For a historical, sanitary view, choose Ross' account."
1,Boring Read about an elitist community,"Reading this book was like watching paint dry....I moved to Celebration in 1998. At first I was charmed by the Disney connection, distinctive house designs (for florida anyway), the nice, well kept streets.Fast forward several years....Celebration now has a -- TERRIBLE -- reputation in the central florida area for being snotty and elitist. It's is a shame what has become of Celebration. Someone should write a book about that."
1,Celebration Resident,What a piece of liberal trash! My five year old found it useful to press flowers.
5,"Front End Cover, LeBra, Vehicle Protection","Nearly perfect fit! This item was an especially good value, and shipping was free!! E-bay couldn't touch this one! Easy installation too! Great seller, super speedy shipping, arrived within 48 hours!!WOW!!"
3,"great band,lousy singer","The title cut is the only thing worth hearing on this album but the rest are tolerable.If you like what the Scorpions were doing around the time this came out you'll like this,too.But Udo's vocal style is unique unto himself...thank goodness."
5,Hard hitting classic metal!,"Accept totally rocks with aggressive sounding tunes and a massive wall of thick guitar tone. Udo is a unique vocalist to say the least, but it all comes together here perfectly. The twin guitar attack is to die for and the pounding rhythm section is full at right on the money. Gene Simmons from Kiss thought these guys kicked some serious butt back then and he wasn't wrong! Yes this is 80's metal at it's gnarly best!!This release along with Metal Heart are their best cd's."
5,One of the classics now even better,This was one of the great metal albums of the 80s & now it sounds better than ever. What a great idea to remaster this! It sounds killer & the packaging is nice too. The two bonus tracks are from the live EP Kaizoiku Ban (?; pardon my spelling) & shows just how great a live band they were as well. Pity I never got to see them. Let's hope they do justice to Restless & Wild & Metal Heart as well with an updated remaster.
2,their best SONG ever! ...,"This album contains Accept's only good song: the title-cut. And what a song it is! Simple, hypnotic, exciting, pure, unforgettable; just brilliant! It still sounds fresh even today. In spirit, it belongs on either Metal Heart or Restless and Wild. BTTW has nothing to do with the rest of the material found on this album--their darkest and what ""sounds"" like their best. The production is also the best of any Accept album. ""Except"" for this song, I'm not a fan of this band. So I'll just leave it at that..."
5,WTF AMAZON!?,HOW COME YOU **** LOVERS AT AMAZON NEVER POST ANY OF THE INTERESTING AND INSIGHTFUL HARD WORKED ON REVIEWS I WRITE? I WROTE A REVIEW FOR THIS AND ABOUT 20 OTHER PRODUCTS AND YOU @$$HOLES DONT POST ANY OF MY REVIEWS! WTF!?
4,"Remastered twice - One awesome, the other is terrible.","Since there are plenty of reviews that cover the music well enough, I'll address the sound quality issue itself.The latest remaster with the 2 live bonus tracks is a horrible mess of dynamic range compression that crushes the life out of this metal masterpiece.There was a remastered version issued in the mid-90's without bonus tracks, but what you DO get is a top notch disc remastered by Sony's Vic Anesini. If you know your audio, then you know who he is & his talents are comparable to Steve Hoffman. The sound has the full dynamic range that makes this album sound so good & reveals how well produced it was. It gives the original vinyl a run for it's money & is worth seeking out. The original catalog number on the disc is: EK 39241.He also mastered Restless & Wild at the same time, but it's this album that shines as one of the best sounding metal albums of the 80's. It's this version that allows you to hear it the way it was intended."
4,INCREDIBLE,"Incredible how a band full of accomplished musicians as guitar player Wolf Hoffmann, bassist Peter Balter and drummer Stefan Jaufmman could be led by such a dreadful singer as Dirk Scheneider, whou can write great tunes but just can't sing at all! Anyway, this record is fantastic!"
5,accept's got big ones,"i first got introduced to this album in high school by a classmate who recorded the title track for me along with a bunch of other songs on a cassette tape. next thing i know, accept gets my attention by grabbing mine in a vise grip and then hops into my music collection. accept isn't a band, it's a way of life."
3,"A Kennel Club Book, the Bedlington","I have read many books in this particular series (Bedlington terrier, Pembroke welsh corgi, Cavalier king charles spaniel) and have found their recipe for making these books: General info on breed, breed history, popular advocates, a little bit about common hereditary diseases, then general grooming/feeding/wellness/activities/training that apply to all breeds of dog. A nice book for the novice (it does talk briefly about copper toxicosis and has very lovely pictures), but for the die-hard Bedlington enthusiast, The Official Book of the Bedlington Terrier is the book to beat."
3,Once and Forever,I have read Constance O-Day Flannery's books in the past but did not enjoy this one. It was not one of those books that you did not want to put down. I would have been very disappointed if I had paid full price for a hardcover book but this was $7.99 for my Kindle. I will not keep on my Kindle for a later read.
3,Once and Forever,"It was written with her usual magical talent. The characters were great. I just had a very difficult time staying with this one written in the time period is was in..Anyone who enjoys the 16th century writings will love it. But I will continue to read all of her novels becuase she is a fantasic writer.. Hope to enoy her next on as much as I did ""Heaven on earth"""
1,THE WORST ROMANCE NOVEL THAT I'VE EVER READ!,"I actually wouldn't even give this book 1 star, but I had to pick something.The cover of the book said that Constance O'Day-Flannery is ""the queen of time travel romance""...I beg to differ. The characters are so LAME! I never got the feeling that Maggie and Nick/Aiden were ""true flames""! I can't believe that I actually paid for this book! If you want a really GOOD time travel romance, I suggest reading Lynn Kurland. For the ULTIMATE book in this genre, then read Diana Gabladon's ""Outlander"" series! Lynn and Diana knows how to develop the main characters in their books. They make you fall in love with them and want to root for them to get and stay together. I'm wondering WHO deemed Ms. O'Day-Flannery the ""queen of time travel romance"". In my book, she's just a ""lady's maid in-waiting""!"
2,Disappointing ... I'm soooooo sorry to say....,"Previous books I have read by Constance O'Day - Flannery were excellent. Though I haven't quite finished this one I am finding that I have to force myself to continue on. I just cannot seem to ""get into"" this book. I find the heroine's behavior bordering on obnoxious to the point that I actually found myself cheering on the bad guy today. YIKES! This book is definitely an exception to the rule with Constance O'Day Flannery. Her previous work was touching and captivating..... I look forward to her next book and a return to excellent stories with endearing characters."
1,Threw it in my fireplace!,"I really wish I had read the reviews on this book before I bought it; then I would have saved my money! I normally dislike time travel romances; they're awkward and unbelievable, but I decided to give this one a chance because it looked interesting. Was I ever wrong! Maggie was obnoxious and Nick was the classic hero, blond, strong, and gorgeous, but lacking any endearing features. The ""eternal love"" they claimed for each other throughout the novel wasn't evident to me. The whole book lacked substance and depth, and I kept putting it down before I FINALLY got through it. All in all, a huge reminder why I don't read time-travel romances all that often. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time(and money! )"
1,Yuck.,"I actually really *like* time travel romance and have previously found this author's work at least entertaining if not outstanding. This book however was egregiously awful. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Heroine annoying, hero boring (though supporting characters not too bad). Between introductions, afterwords, ads for other books, etc etc, you're not getting nearly as much novel as you think you are, but I guess given the quality of this book that's not all bad. The nearly non-existent plot is hopelessly uninteresting and completely peters out toward the end. I can't believe I stuck it out til the end - it never did improve."
3,A good action novel with an implausible scenario.,"This Coonts novel failed to live up to his previous works. I kept asking myself how plausible the scenario was--the Japanese invading the Russian Far East. The US role was murky--there was no attempt to explain how Japan just withdrew from its security alliance with the US. What was even harder to believe was Coonts' silence about China--its attitude toward a Russia-Japan war is not even addressed. Does Coonts think that China, no friend of Japan, is going to sit idly by while Japan invades eastern Russia in an attempt to gobble up Russian natural resources? I think Coonts gets carried away with his depiction of air battles. He could have written a more thoughtful novel with this material."
3,"Disappointing, seems like a rehash of another book.","I have long been a fan of Coonts books, but I found an awful lot of parellels with Tom Clancy's book ""Debt of Honor"". I did enjoy the alternative plot, but my initial reaction was dismay at what seems to be a reprise of another author's work. Finally though I will continue to read Coonts and I expect to enjoy his future works. Thank You."
2,Review,The book was okay. I found that it lacked in character development and didn't care how it ended.
1,Not Coonts best work,This book lacked charcter development. He gives you no idea what the charctes are like. This book was also a one sided story. The Story only told of three countries getting involved when in a war when i think if the Japenese invaded Russia more countries would have been involved. This book also had little discription on the current situations.
1,"Could have been worse, but he would have to have tried","Ok, so you think you've read to worst tech thriller? Not until you've tried Fortunes of War.Complex plot, believable characters, a realistic scenario...these are all dicarded in favour of some chest pounding and flag waving for the good ole US.Mr Coonts gives the Japanese a super plane to make the kids from the US underdogs but to allow them to win makes the Japanese so stupid as to be comical.I knew I was losing interest when I started skimming chapters to try and get to the end.A 14 year old could have done a better job.Quite simply: the worst book I've read this year.Mr Coonts, if you're reading this, I want my money back!"
3,"Nice light read, but not captivating","This was my first read of a Coonts book. It's not bad, but not of the caliber of Larry Bond or Tom Clancy. The character development is weak and many of the characters are unbelievable caricatures. Still, the plot is solid, if uninspired; this makes a good travel book (for reading on an airplane) for fans of the genre."
5,fortunes of war,"Book arrived within a few days and was in the condition that it was described or better, very happy with there service."
1,Implausible,"How can anyone swallow the idea that the US, in accordance with a mutual defence treaty with Russia, send only a non USAF non US government protected single squadron to assist Russia. The story relies heavily on the precepts of honour as they apply to individuals Only saving grace is great descriptions of air to air and ASW operations"
4,"Good, but not his best......","I enjoyed this book, but Coonts has done better. I would recommend for anyone who is a Coonts or Clancy junkie. Now, back to the A-6 Intruder."
5,Great Thriller,Also picked up a book with a blurb on the cover by Coonts: THE OMEGA MISSILE. Another great thriller.
4,"Excellent as usual, nice premise.","I thought it to be an interesting premise. Japan attempting to become a more powerful player in the world balance of power. The ending was predictable, but interesting. Can't wait for his next one."
2,My expectations from this writer were unmet.,"Mr. Coonts's descriptions of flying and dogfighting are excellent. However, his plot is very thin. And, nothing really earth shattering ever happens. How disappointing!"
5,"A NICE READ, BUT POINTLESS","this author, which has written books so beatiful, has given the world this one which is also beatiful, but pointless, i guess that the main character is himself. the book does not have a plot or at least is not going anywhere, but it is not boring, and it is a good read. i just loved it, even though when i finished i had the sensation of not being told anything new. the book has gone into oblivion and will propably stay there, the one i read i took it from the library and i was the only one who got it from the shelf in more than a decade, i guess it is there in the shelf at the library, waiting for another ten years until some reader will take it down, and write another pointless review about it....LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
4,The best destroyer simulation!,"I have read other reviews on this game and I think it deserves better ratings than it has received. It is a beautiful game as far as graphics are concerned. Ubi soft is a great software producer and they should really consider updating this game so it can run on Windows XP and other advanced systems. If you have Windows 95 or 98, this game will generally satisfy your curiosity about World War 2 destroyers. Other reviewers assert there are some glitches in the game. While that may be true, all games have some weakness. I think this game is worth buying. I wish it could run on my advanced operating system. I would be playing it and enjoying it thoroughly if I could. The historical accuracy of the game is educational and exciting. Someday maybe Ubi soft will come out with a modernized version. You may also wish to consider these:Silent Hunter III (DVD-ROM)andSilent Hunter 4 : Wolves of the Pacific (PC-DVD). Submarines are the focus but destroyers are out there!"
1,Dreary,"Dreary. Overly complex. Poorly thought out. Poor, hard to read manual. The first training task asked you to go to the bottom of the page and observe the action buttons there. The action buttons were not there and only seemed to appear randomly. Graphics were poor quality. Counter-intuitive menus leading god knows where. Game software should be written to be run without a manual. This one needs a manual and a magnifying glass to read the small print. Once you go through all that trouble you will still not understand what they are talking about. Save your money this is junk."
2,Maybe try it on version 20.0,"I have been waiting for a good World War II naval surface game, but with all the bugs I have experienced, I guess I still have to wait.On a side note, reporting bugs to the publisher is not an easy task......"
1,Save your money!!!,This game is as buggy as SH2. Ubi soft has not even released the patch for SH2. The AI in Destroyer Command and Silent Hunter 2 is so unrealistic it takes away from game play. Someone at Ubi soft should learn the proper way to write code for PC games. Save your money and buy from a company that has a track record and not a lot of hype and false promises.
3,Mostly O.K.,"This game has great gameplay overall, it has a wide range of mission, battles over land, sea and air. This game is much better than most navel simulations that does not envolve player flyable aircraft. Internet play is great to, allowing you to play with gamers from Silent Hunter 2. Don't get me rong it is not without flaws like every other game, the only one that I can think of is that the graphics are pretty bad. From a expert gamer, I recommend Destroyer Command!!!!!"
2,2 soft,"these tires look cool but for mountain riding, they stink. the rubber is too soft within riding about 40 miles on rough terrain the knobs have fallen or ripped off the tires. granted i do ride them hard on mountain trails with lots of rocks and cactus but if you need it for the street, they look great."
4,Rattlebacks,"I've put about 100 miles on these tires so far, almost exclusively on crushed gravel and (mostly) sand trails with a slight bit of singletrack and grass. The grip is fantastic. The tread life, however, seems possibly lacking. The knobs on the rear tire are showing significant signs of abuse in the forms of tears and ""shredding"" .. Maybe I should take pictures to help explain it. Anyway, it looks like I'll get maybe 400 to 600 miles from this set based on current wear which seems to me to be pretty poor for how much these tires cost. I've gotta say they do look nice on my bike, though. :)"
5,Best of Smokey Robinson & The Miracles,"What can I say, there is only one Smokey Robinson! All the songs on this CD are classic top shelf. I would recommend this CD to everyone who is a fan."
4,You Really Got a hold on me!,"Smokey Robinson is an American legend and his group, the Miracles, should be commended for their talents in the Motown generation and era. There was a song in the 1980s which was ""When Smokey Sings,"" and this compact disc tries to provide a taste or sampling of his talent and the appetite that the public had for his musical style. His voice is clear and soothing. His other songs here like ""Cruisin"" are just only a taste for his style. You'll want more from Smokey Robinson if you haven't built a collection in his honor. Still, the Miracles are also worth mentioning because they were his group. I don't know much about the Miracles but I only have a little taste of it. I also like the songs, ""Tears of A Clown,"" and ""Just to See Her"" on this disc but I think that they could have provided more songs."
5,Nothing is better than real LSATs!,"This is the real deal. Previously administered LSATs. No explanations or guidance is provided, but this book is just tests. Regardless of what source you use for preparing to take the LSAT, practice testing is the key to scoring high. This book offers 3 real LSATs. Other volumes are also available that offer other test versions. Simple, but exactly what you need."
2,"Lots of info, not interesting","While this book had plenty of facts, it read like a scrambled textbook, which may have been the goal. I was looking for something that was flowing and that had chapters devoted to each man. It was rather rambling in form. I feel the body of the text didn't actually follow the title. One of the few civil war related books I really didn't care for. I realize it was a compilation; could have been better."
4,Good book,I really like the book so far. Very informative on the Civil War. Would recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about the Civil War.
4,The Attic Is A Great Movie,I would definitely recommend The Attic.It's a great movie.It will keep you suspenseful throughout until the end.You won't believe the ending.
3,Does NOT fit 60 GB video iPod!,"This is a fairly generic case, and I imagine it works for a 30GB ipod, but it does NOT fit the 60GB video iPod. I either missed this in the item description, or it was not clearly stated (not sure which), but be careful if you have the 60 GB version."
5,Pink Floyd at its prime.,"Its that simple.This collection of live tracks is astonishing.This gives people the chance to experience the early and most abstract years/tracks of ""Pink Floyd"". Well worth the money for any collector or Space-Rocker :P"
4,A NICE READ FROM CHAIMAN OF THE BOARD,THIS IS THE STORY OF WHITEY FORD. IT IS VERY EASY READING AND ENJOYABLE BOOK. WHITEY DOESN'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT ALL THE DRINKING AND CAROUSING HE AND HIS BUDDIES (BILLY AND MICKEY) DID.BUT HE HAS SEVERAL FUNNY STORIES. IT QUITE ENTERTAINING AND ENLIGHTENING. WHITEY TELLS ABOUT US WHAT HE HAD TO DO IN HIS LATER YEARS TO STAY HANG ON. HE GOES INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT SCUFFING THE BALL AND OTHER WAYS HE USED TO DOCTOR THE BALL. HE IS A GOOD STORY TELLER AND I RECOMMEND THIS ALL BASEBALL FANS.
3,Slick My Life In and Around Baseball,"I enjoyed reading this book. I found this book interesting, funny, and informative. Most books I read seem to be dull and boring but this one was different. If you are a fan of baseball then i think you will enjoy reading this book. This book gives the point of view from a profesional baseball player and his expeirence of what goes on that people don't get to see pro athletes do and how they act. I would recomend this book to all readers because I think they would enjoy it as I did."
5,Superb usage of candomble Religion for divination,"This amazing book and deck allow for a truly supernatural experience in Tarot reading. Not only was I impressed with the results of the reading with this deck but it's consistent accuracy is a thing of wonder!The authors bring to vivid reality the Candomble religion and it's symbolism, and the Tarot's depictions of the Orishas are nothing short of breathtaking....It has changed my life...."
4,Interesting and one of a kind,"This is a very personal book to the writers system and path. You will either like it or pass it over as a personal belief system. If you are an open minded practitioner or a tarot collector you will delight in the work that has gone into this book and its translation. Keep in mind that Santeria in this more pure form will lend little to your Hoodoo practice, it is a very serious presentation of this mans training and life work and beliefs in Santeria. I am not a Santeria practitioner so I can not rate it in that category , but I enjoy reading this book from a old tarot readers prospective."
3,Tyrone,"I was a little embarrassed giving this as a gift for Christmas. It had a dusty look about it, as if it was a hand me down. I haven't heard anything from the child's parents since Christmas, so I assume there have been no problems and their son is enjoying it."
2,disppointment,"Very disappointed in receiving was suppose to sing a song and talk and all when you pushed its belly all it did was make a sick sound. I was very happy with how easy amazon made it to return. No trip to the post office, just print out mailing label put it out for ups/mail person and the credit showed up on my account."
3,Just Ok,Came with dead batteries. Cost $2 ea battery to replace and takes 3 so the batteries cost almost as much as the toy- be prepared. Sings cute songs and has one saying. My girls love Backyardigans. Not what I thought- overall save your money
5,Funny DVD,"Funny DVD for kids. Even though they make the dad out to be a doofus, I made sure to watch this with my son and explain that most dads are not doofuses."
4,A Classic,"Sort of hard to watch, as the protagonist and his friends are so self-destructive, but then it's probably a good depiction of a smart kid with limited life experience trying to make sense of the world."
5,Excellent review,"I have delighted reading this book, its organization and emphasis on basic ideas blend very well with the rather exhaustive coverage of practical issues."
1,This books reeks.....!!!! [money] wasted,"How can a person write this stuff?? David Bret seems content to make up a whole new life for Rudolph Valentino. He backs up the most wild stories of a secret gay life with........well nothing. No interviews, no references, no sources...at best conjecture. I would imagine that Mr. Bret..wishes Mr. Valentino had been gay. I am sure that this book paid his mortage for a while, but it does incredible damage to the legacy of a great actor and person."
3,valentino's latin sexualty,"although all of the undocumented homosexual affairs of valentino mentioned in this book may not be exactly true, his homosocialty rings true in my experience of the latin male sexuality where appearances are everything and anything goes privately. some of the mentioned associations may have been mere friendships between two friends who shared either homo or bisexualty. that valentino was sexually attracted to andre devan is convincing particularly in light of his travel diary published in the 1920s[ a copy of which i own]. it subtley reveals more than either valentino or the publishers may have known.this book gave me an insight into the sexuality of valentino ."
3,ANOTHER OPINION--WHO CAN SAY?,"Another book--Valentino was gay or wasn't he--or bisexual--Probably more gay than bisexual...but...what is the difference NOW---it was a big deal back then....It is an interesting book if you are have an interest in the Rudolph Valentino legend, that's all.........I would not say it is awful or not worth the money, it is just another book...."
1,Bio or Creative Writing?,"Curiousity got the better of me, so I read the whole thing in less than two hours. This was a repeat performance of his last book about Joan Crawford. David Bret seems to be following a recipe for mediocrity......collect all the salacious stories you can about your long dead victim (Valentino), throw in a heavy doses of gossip about friends and acquaintances (also long dead), flesh out the stories with graphic detail, call it a book, and sell it. Seriously, if you want to read an excellent Valentino bio read Emily Leider's book which is an objective treatment and well researched. Bret's book is a joke and not worth your $ or your time."
1,Why Does David Bret Bother?,"David Bret has a horrible reputation...Not only are his books complete and utter garbage- a cross between poor reiteration of common knowledge and ridiculous fantasy nonsense- BUT, he is known to crash fansites of the individual he's writing about and- if they've dared to acknowledge that his work is, in fact, garbage- unleashing an onslaught of tasteless, offensive vulgarities & insults. And he delights in this. Truly sick.I came across this book recently, and it's more of the same nonsense. What was factual has been written countless times before, and better. Beyond that he seems determined as a biographer to do little else than give credence to the ancient rumours of Valentino's sexuality.Skip this and find something more reliable, like ""Hollywood Babylon"" or the National Enquirer."
3,Undocumented sources,"The book is interesting in that it reveals Valentino's involvement with a number of male lovers, but it is frustrating in that no documentation is offered to support the narrative. David Bret fails to cite the sources for what he reports and quotes are likewise not cited. There are also a few factual errors in the text, such as referring to the California jail that Valentino was incrcerated in overnight as ""the Tombs"" (which is in fact in New York)."
1,Yet another blunder by Bret,"There has been no direct evidence that Rudolph Valentino was homosexual, yet that doesn't stop David Bret from trying. He'll confuse dates, names and places to get his message across that Valentino had affairs with Al Jolson or William Boyd.So if there is no direct evidence why do we need a David Bret to tell us otherwise? We don't."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered a few of these when our mom died to give to my sisters. After reveiwing it, I still have them all. This book is for women whose mothers passed when they were young and who haven't had a mother to bring them up. That isn't our case as the youngest of us is 46. It did us no good but I'm sure it might help women in that situation."
5,Very insightful and helpful book,"I lost my mother to breast cancer on October of 1999, at the age of 21. She was only 42 at the time of her death. Desperate to find answers to my questions and a justification for the feelings I was going through, I decided to buy this book after I read that Rosie O'Donell had recommended it. I truly believe that this is THE best book out there for women who have lost their mothers. It is a comprehensive look at what it is like to lose you mother at any age and under varying circumstances. I felt like I had no resources to turn to after I lost my mother, and this was truly my saving grace. When I lost my mother, I felt so very alone, as if I was the only person going through this extreme agony, but this book helped to show me that others had gone through the same very thing.Thank you so much Hope!!!"
2,"I was 16, not 32; it was heart disease, not cancer.","I lost my mother at the age of 16 on 12/24/98. This book was recommended to me by a lady saying it would help me, it didn't. In fact, it made me scared to have kids from the accounts of other womens' horror stories of trying to raise thier childeren after they had lost thier mother. Hope Edelman had lost her mother to cancer, as did seem a lot of the other women. She didnt touch down on other diseases besides cancer and also sucide. My mother died of a form of heart disease. It was mentioned only a couple of times. It was hard to read knowing that is Edelman's opion, Motherless Daughters will never heal. That they carry pain with them for the rest of thier lives. As true as it may be, it has severly put a negative outlook on my oun mouring. And for the record, childern can mourn just as long if not more than adults. And it hurts just as much. No matter how old you are........."
1,It Still Isn't Helping Me 2 Years Later,"I read this book 2 years ago and gave it a review then. Now, two years after my mother's death, I picked up the book, hoping maybe I was harsh becaues of the trama of the life changing event. Honestly, re-reading the book brought out the same pain I had felt. Apparently, people are being helped by it, but I found more hurt than help."
4,Motherless Daughters,This is a very good book that I would recommend to a younger female. I could really feel the pain of these young women! I
2,"Motherless Daughters: The Legacy of Loss, Second Edition",I didn't really feel that it helped me. I didn't really identify with it although some parts I did agree with.
3,Not really relevant to my situation,"I bought this book for myself, after a friend recommended it (whose mother passed away when she was 13). My mother passed away in August, and it's now February. I was really looking forward to reading the book, as I thought it would help in the healing process. I think the book is better suited for someone who lost their mother at a young age, like the author. My mother passed away when I was 41, and the book doesn't really touch on motherless daughters who are my age. There have been certain excerpts that have helped, but after finishing the book, I found myself wishing it had been different."
2,It didn't fit for me having lost my mother as an infant.,I would like to find a book that dealt with the loss of a parent at a young age. I was two days old when my mother died of a brain hemmorage (sp). I didn't get to spend any time with my mother and this book talked alot about having had a mother until the teen years or beyond.
5,A true inspiration to all young and old motherless daugters.,I am 20 years old and feeling the deep loss of my mother more than ever. My mother died when I was 16 years old of ALS. I was given this book for my 20th birthday from my college roommate. I could not put it down. It gave me chills up and down my back. I cried after reading just two pages/ It brought back memories I had suppressed for a couple of years. This book has given me hope and inspiration to move on but never forget. I will keep it in my book collection forever.
4,Age of loss,"I read and enjoyed this book when it came out in hardback in 1994. As befits the author's own experience, it concentrates on mother loss by daughters in their teens. I'd be more interested in a treatment of mother loss by infant daughters -- nothing against the book, though.I just read a review of a new biography of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who began his ""Confessions"" by saying ""I am made unlike anyone I have ever met."" I thought, ""That man lost his mother in infancy."" Sure enough, two paragraphs down in the review, ""His mother had died just after his birth."" I guess I'll just read the Rousseau biography for insight into shattering alienation from early mother loss. Though I may also try ""Don't Call Me Mother,"" referenced in one of the reviews below."
4,Motherless Daughter,Great resorce book that honors the impact of a daughter loosing her mother regardless of her age or circumstances. Can be used as a study guide for discussion in support group. Great resource for couselors and families members to help them support the grieving daughters and participate constuctively in their process of healing.
5,the only grief book that spoke to me...,"I read a ton of books after losing my Mom, searching for something... but was disappointed one after another. My sister and I bonded over sending each other books back and forth and discussing some of the points that made sense or didn't. Then she called me...told me she wanted to send me a book she had just read, but that I shouldn't wait, I should just go and buy it.I started crying a couple pages in...someone understood what I was going through. I felt normal, and in touch with the sorrow in my heart..but not alone.I have bought this book for other women many times. I agree with another reviewer that it might be best for a little time to pass after the initial loss before reading this book."
4,Learning I wasn't alone meant the most,"I resisted buying this book because I grew up feeling that I should just ""get over it."" I'm in my early 30's and my mother died when I was 17 months old. As wonderful as my father is, I have always felt the void of my mother's absence in my life, and more so as I get older. ""Motherless Daughters"" taught me that my feelings are not unique, but I wish there had been more about losing your mother as a baby or toddler. My mom died when I was walking and talking, so I am sure I grieved, but I have no memories of her life or death. It would be nice to have some follow-up about people who never had the precious opportunity to know their mothers."
5,Great book,Must read for anyone who lost their mother at a young age. Gives great insight into why you do things you do!
5,classic,"They play this movie all the time on Disney, and I never get tired of it. The characters are just so ridiculous and stupid, it cracks me up every time. And the Certifiable guy, oh.... so amusing. This is basically about this guy who has unrequited love for this girl who is (supposed to be, at least) very attractive, but these evil bullies thwart his plans for taking her to some concert by taking over his paper route. so in the end, they all band together to get the bad guys.classic."
1,Netaya cancels orders after charging my credit card?,I placed a lot of orders with Netaya during their recent sale. After not receiving any notification that my items had shipped I called them up to find out why. Netaya decided to cancel my orders because they had second thoughts about their sale. And they charged my card! Now I have to wait and see if they will give me my money back. What reputable company behaves in this manner?
3,A Good Not So Solid Story,"This is in review of the Audio version (1 Cassette, 1 hour run time). I was, overall, disappointed in this story. The thought of Captain Sulu crawling around on hands and knees through ductwork was humerous (although Kirk did it at least once). Takai sounds wooden in his acting role, and is at times drowned out by the sound effects (at least when listening in an automobile). I did enjoy the story, but it jumps around a bit, and the thought of a Star Base or base of any kind easily being taken over is ludicrous."
1,Crap!,"I should have known it was crap, but ever the optimist I decided to give it a try. It was not just bad; it stunk: `Star Trek: Envoy' was garbage from the word go. The CD had one (1) track, and my cars CD player only lets you skip tracks (no fast forward - but it does hold 6 CD's). Instead of reading the story, these morons added sound effects, background noise, and had different people reading different parts. I got through about 10 minutes before I went to the next CD. It was loud, pointless, annoying, and endlessly repetitive - pure crap! I didn't even get to any of George Takei's dialog."
4,Sporty tee with very good feel,"Bought this tee on sale for $18 from Dick's and very pleased with it because:- Loose fit and light on body, so makes you sweat less and play more.- Love the shiny/reflective trim on the front & back."
1,Cepia Battery Caddyy System Sprayer doesn't spray!,"It appears to be a great idea and should be a time saving and easy way to spray my plants without having to carry around a heavy container. However, I cannot get it to work. The pump runs, but I cannot get water that I was using as a test to come out of the sprayer wand!"
2,cheaply made,"This spray is made very cheaply, the handle broke off the second time I used it, it's a great idea if it was made sturdier."
1,don't buy it.,"This is the worst sprayer I have ever seen. Used it once, it never worked again.............."
1,Junk,"I have used TWO of these. They never last a year. Plastic breaks and pump simply stops working. I even took one apart hoping to fix it. No luck. All throw-away parts. JUNK product. When new it works fine, however it is so cheaply made it doesn't last!!!"
1,Neither a perfume or a skin moisturizer,"Liquid Satin has very little scent or moisture qualities. Thus, there is no reason to by this worthless product."
3,"""Sentimental"".","After an eight years hiatus, Tanita Tikaram comes back with an ordinarily new good album. The mood of the album is rather mellow and jazzy. It however complements well the 1998 release,""The Cappuccino Songs""(TCS). My favourite song in TCS is track 8, ""If I Ever"" is replaced by the beautiful melodic favourite ""Forever"" in Sentimental which is also track 8. Other favourite songs include, ""Something New"", ""Don't Shake Me Up"", ""Everyday Is New"" and ""Love Is Just A Word"". She could have added four more songs than her usual ten songs compilation to strengthen the album. She is a very talented artist & could certainly offer much more than what she delivers here."
3,NOTHING SPECIAL A DISSAPOINTMENT,dISSAPOINTING AFTER WAITING SO LONG FOR A NEW ALBUM BUT THE SONGS DO REPRESENT THE TITLE SENTIMENTAL VERY MUSHY BUT THE MUSIC DOES NOT STIR ANYTHING WITHIN ME AS HER PREVIOUS ALBUMS.ALTHOUGH i DID NOT LIKE CAPPACINO AS MUCH AS THE EARLIER ALBUMS
4,i liked this item,"this is the cutest piggy bank i have ever seen. it isn't tiny and it isn't too big. The only thing is that I did have to personalize it myself, and after 2 years, the personalization smuged off. If you are buying this piggy bank because of the personalization feature, don't buy it, if you like the looks of it, get it! it is a great bank."
2,wasn't personalized (as advertised),"The bank was suposed to be personalized with the child's name and birth date, even though the data was provided, the bank was blank when it was recieved. Had I known it wasn't going to be pesonalized (as advertised), I never would have ordered it. It would have cost me more to return it to have it personalized (not to mention, the time it would take as well as the trouble,EXPENSE and AGGRAVTION), personalization was the ONLY reason I ordered it. I'll be sure to tell my friends about my experience"
4,Nice collection,"This is a pretty full collection of plays by American women. I definitely preferred this collection to the previous one, 1900-1930. Each play is preceded by a brief biography of the author and description of her major works. Fun to read, diverse collection."
5,"Fans, owners, players and the role of baseball in the American society are all presented in a delightful and amusing manner.","Baseball fans will love this collection of cartoons that capture the essence of baseball in the American psyche. My two favorites in the collection appear on pages 34 and 72. The one on page 34 features a man wearing a religious collar standing in the stands and yelling, ""Thou hast eyes to see, and see not!"" On page 72 a player is being tagged while sliding into home. The umpire says, ""I don't know when I've seen a more magnificent slide. You're out!""Fans, owners, players and the role of baseball in the American society are all presented in a delightful and amusing manner."
3,Good picture quality but some limitations,"I'm really torn with this product, because it's really nice to have, the picture quality is good, it's small and easy to carry around and it didn't cost too much. However, I think I would get more pictures with a real digital camera (including flash and LCD).The upside is that the image quality is really good, it's easy to transfer the images to PC (as it goes straight in the USB slot and appears as a drive) and there's no worry about batteries as it's internal battery charges over USB.The flaws are as follows:- What appears in the viewfinder isn't always comletely in the image - chops peoples heads off on occasion for instance).- No LCD to preview images - a big deal when it chops peoples heads off and you don't know!- Doesn't work well in low light conditions- Not clear if/when the image is takenI think, if you have an extra $50, look for a real digital camera with zoom, flash and LCD, unless you really need the ultra-small formfactor of this device."
3,Not bad - Not Great - but handy,"I didn't pay for this. I purchased it with a free certificate I earned so I am happy for that. This camera is really handy and I like that feature and if you are still, the object you are shooting is still and if you are outside or have good light this camera takes a really nice picture. If you move too fast before it ""clicks on off"" then you will have a nasty photo. That is the worst thing about it."
5,Much better than the old version,"I had the original KEY070 a couple of years ago. It was cute, but this one is a huge improvement. The optical quality is greatly improved, which is good because the resolution is too. It also seems to perform better in low-light. It's not going to replace a ""real"" digital camera for indoor/low-light or for those priceless graduation pictures, but for a $60 camera you can throw in your pocket you can't go wrong."
2,Bad as in not good,"I am a long time fan of beach music, Carolina branch, but I must say that I am disappointed in the quality of this CD. Remakes of songs that did not need remaking, JD Cash sounds like bad Sinatra to my ears. The re do of Don't Worry Baby was surprisingly listenable. The beach music vibe was there on about half of the tunes. I have a feeling that this music and these bands sound much better live, with a cold beer in your hands in a club at ocean side. Maybe volume 1 has a higher quality of work. It's not terrible, just disappointing."
5,product comment,This was part of a series I have also been looking for for some time and not only was it in great condition but it came really fast which was great. I have purchased two books for hard to find series I have and neither of them a disappointment to me as they might have been. I would not any any problems looking for your company as I know you would more than likely have what I need and it would be in the best of condition. Many thanks to you.
5,Book #2 in Saga and a great one at that!,"Webb fought the newcomer's who rushed to claim grasslands where Calder cattle grazed. Lilli is a proud young immigrant married to a man who instigates fights with the Calder's. When her husband dies, she marries Webb and they fight droughts and harsh weather together along with Webb's nemesis Krueger. This man goes mad and kills Lilli. Webb is devasted. The love of his life... he only had a couple of years...is dead. BUT....they had a son, Chase!"
3,An Introduction to an experimental material,"Papercrete has that elusive scent of being a truly revolutionary material. It is both new and old (a new twist on paper machee). For alternative builders, it is the bigest thing since Fuller's dome. The book is crude and basic which is appropriate for a new material right out of the chute. It is enough to make aspiring architects drool. Forget those bulky space robbing haybales."
4,Good show for my 2 yr son,"My son loves the animation shows like bob the builder. I thought I would buy Jay Jay to try something different and he loved it! He sits there going ""WEEEEE! WEEEEE!"". He now loves planes and ""copters"" as he calls them"
1,Not Very Good,"My wife and I fell in love with Blue Mountain Coffee while in Jamaica. We bought two 8 ounce bags of JABLUM while in Ocho Rios. It was nothing like what was served at the resort. Rather than being a dark roast, it was lighter than Folger's. It tasted like dirt as well."
4,Audiophile sound at a great price,"Bought this for my dad who is an audiophile and loves the TEAC brand. He needed something smaller sized and I needed excellent sound at a great price. This met all our needs and exceeded my expectations. It came with a subwoofer and even turned up to the max there was no sound distortion. It could be mounted on the wall and took up very little space. Best of all, when I visit, I can plug in my mp3! The only drawback on this unit is that it only plays one cd but overall it was exactly what I wanted."
4,Great narrative of Antarctic flying,"Mark Hinebaugh's book about the experiences of an Antarctic pilot serving with the Navy's VXE-6 squadron is right on base. I know because I was there also. His recollections of the condtions that these men and women serve in should make the hair stand up on the neck of even the most seasoned pilot. Some of the writing may not be understood by a non flyer but Mark goes to great length to explain what exactly is going on down on the frozen continent to all readers. Although this is a very speacialized book that deals with one navy squadron only,it should do well with anyone who has ever flown as well as anyone who has ever wanted to."
5,Outstanding! Now I know what its like being in the coldest,place on the planet as only an incredibly brave Naval Pilot could. Thanks Mark for getting us there and bringing us back home again safely!
5,This is an accurate presentation of Antarctic flying.,"I was also an Antarctic piolt in the same squadron (VXE-6) a few years before the author. His descriptions of the continent of Antarctica, and the operations that the squadron performed, brought back many memories of my 3 years in VXE-6. He also expanded on my understanding of the history of Antarctic exploration. Anyone who is interested in a good description of a unique area of the world (that very few people ever get to see) would enjoy this book. Antarctica is a beautiful, but very unforgiving place, and the author describes it well. I would also recommend this book to anyone who has flight experience because the flying in Antarctica is unique and the Antarctic pilot's instrument flying skill is tested on a daily basis. The squadron's mission was to support science and exploration and ""to boldly go where no man has gone before"". How many places on earth can you think of that fit that description?"
3,Poorly informed pilot presents one-sided view?,"This book is a great read as a story of adventure. But as a scientist - and one with colleagues who have worked in Antarctica, including on one of the experiments touched on in this book - I found mis-statments in the narrative and footnotes suggesting that the author was not well-informed about the science he was ""supporting"". He certainly supported the science logistically, but he comes across as very unsupportive of the scientific enterprise in general. A pity then that an otherwise enjoyable book should be marred by a poor attitude towards the scientific research that provided the reason for the author to be in Antarctica in the first place."
1,Worked Once,"I purchased this for light duty use after my previous model (NOT Hitachi)finally gave up after more than 20 years of use.I was able to blow up 4 tires to 40lbs once. The next time I went to use it, It ran for a few seconds and then started to smell of burning plastics. It appears the stator burned out.So far Hitachi has not responded, and a little research shows the stator is a $135 part (I paid $99 for the compressor).So I have a large paperweight.I've purchased several Hitachi tools, some are quite good. But there's lots of good brands out there, and if Hitachi (or Amazon) won't stand behind a clearly defective product, they won't be seeing any more of my money.It's sad that the concept of customer service has little meaning, and making excuses is the order of the day.I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase."
2,poor factory quality control,The unit arrived yesterday. When I unpacked it I plugged it in and it started up normally. Then I noticed the entire control unit including guages and tubing were shaking and that whole unit was loose. Also the face of one of the guages was bent and broken and the safety air bleed valve was broken off so I needed a pliers to bleed of the air. The shipping box was undamaged so I'm sure it was shipped from the factory in this condition. Needless to say I am sending the unit back for a refund. Its too bad since I own some other Hitachi tools and they have been great.
3,A good description of the FW-190 service history,"This book does a good job of describing the FW-190 service in the Western Front in terms of the units and pilots who flew them. A comprehensive history is provided of the FW-190 from its design stages up until the last days of the war. The highlight of the book is the superb color plates of more than a dozen FW-190 variants clearly showing color schemes and unit markings at various times in the war that make this book perfect for any scale modeller.The only thing that prevented me from giving this book a 5-star was twofold. There are no interviews from ex-pilots (some of whom are still with us). Also there is a glaring lack of basic technical information (speed, dimensions, armament) on the FW-190 and its variants. Some technical information can be gleaned from the text but it is incomplete. In short, if you are a scale modeller keen on FW-190 markings, you will be overjoyed with this book. Otherwise it is still a good read, just not great."
3,Interesting read.,"I found it kind of hard to rate only because of how to categorize. If you like indepth novels then this isn't it. I would say it's more like the cliff notes. However, it still is a good read. I like the actual photos of the aircraft and hearing about the aces that flew them."
5,Just about every thing I wanted to know on this subject.,This book greatly expanded my knowledge on not only the P-39 and its strengths and weaknesses but also the methods and personalities of the war timeVVS. This is a great companion to Red Stars Against the Swastica which I recently read. When I was growing up in the 50s and 60s this kind of information was unobtainable.
2,Zzzzzzzzzz,"A difficult read due to turgid, repetitive Soviet-style prose. I would reccomend this book only to a historian or a very serious aviation buff. I count myself as one of the latter, and I'm having trouble working up the interest to get more than halfway through this one."

1,Broke Game in Half,This is by far the worst basketball game I have ever played. I bought it in a bundle on eBay and having not played a basketball game for some years I thought I'd try it out for $4.95 free shipping.Worst game ever. I couldn't even shoot. I snapped the game in half. Cut my hand open 13 stitches.POS.
3,Could be better,"Major flaw: Collision detection.For whatever reason, EA has never really gotten the whole collision detection thing with it's NBA Live series. Players tend to slip and slide around each other and there is no real sense that playing defense is even remotely possible. I don't know how many times I've played this game online and watched someone dominate on the inside with a mediocre-at-best big man. It's so frustrating!!With that being said...if you're looking for a run and gun, fast break basketball game...this is your game! It is fun to just cut loose and see how many points you can score. But if you are partial to fundamental, team basketball...this might be a bit of a disappointment."
1,bites big time,"don't buy this dvd. i thought it would be good because the concept sounded great, space visuals and techno - heck yea! i know my techno, for over 14 years, and the music is awful. also it's not a mixed dvd. it sounds like a bunch of b-side tracks they wanted to [put out] some gimmick. they even ruined some of the NASA videos my jerking them around to match the music. much more irritating then relaxing. i rarely return things to amazon but this one i will simply because it's so bad."

3,Uneven but still useful.,"This television version has many flaws--from actors stepping on each other's lines, to bad microphone placement, to an obviously robust Welles' proclaiming his weakness and frailty in the face of chaotic nature and bad fortune. Still, there are scenes that convey the play's meanings more straightforwardly and clearly than any you will fine in later filmizations. The crucial opening scene, for example, effectively and efficiently sets up the play in a manner that students immediately grasp. The film is still a useful teaching tool (and obviously of interest to Welles' devotees), providing one is selective in its use."
1,Dreadful,"I'm a huge Orson Welles fan. His MacBeth is still my favorite of all the versions available. But this is a disaster: horrible sound and video quality (like watching through your aquarium), a script butchered to nothing,the ending changed and Welles in an outfit that looks like it was borrowed from Lost in Space (the photo on the cover is from MacBeth). Useful as a curiousity peice for Shakespeare or Welles fanatics only."
2,heavily cut and overacted,"This Lear is of historical interest - old TV trying to be cultured, but it is a very poor enactment of the play. It seems to belong to the Shakespeare presentations of a century ago."
5,W.S. Gutierrez,I'm a big fan of all fiction. I love science fiction when it doesn't get so technical you have to be an engineer or astrophysicist to follow it and it has to have a good plot. This book contains both. The characters are sympathetic and compelling. It's easy to follow and leaves you waiting for the next installment! What an imagination T.P. Norling has! I hope he allows us into it again very soon.
5,perfect,compression fit indeed.good for cold or hot days whether for work out or casual wear underneath reg clothes to provide an extra layerof insulation especially if worn over a long sleeve under armor compression long sleeve on cold days aroun50 - 30 degrees.
4,Nice Book,"I am working on web based Telecommunications product development. We have to introduce voiceXML features in our product. I bought this book couple of weeks back. This book covers all the basic concepts include conventional telephony input, output and call control features, including: touch-tone input, automatic speech recognition support, audio recording (e.g., for voice mail), the ability to play recordings (such as WAV files), speech synthesis from plain or annotated text, call transfer, conferencing, and other advanced call management features.I have easily learned XML-based definition with an HTML-like appearance. This book is more useful for experienced web content programmers. The author explained every topic with real example. The ""Hello World"" example in this book is great."
2,VoiceXML for very beginners,The book is a general overview of telephony application and a thin introduction to VoiceXML. It covers important matters in a very rapid and unprecise way. It contains even errors in the examples.
1,very poor book,"I am very disappointed after buying this book. Lot of examples don't work. Lot of mistakes are all over the book. I just tried the example (p. 246) about <subdialog name=""..."" uri=""..."" /> then found out that <subdialog /> does not have uri attribute (p. 340) (<submit> doesn't have neither). Some examples use </block> as an begin-tag, some use <block/> as an end-tag. The author use <-- comment --> for comments everywhere in the book. I found a long error-list from this book. I wish the author takes more time to double check before publishing this book. The time you (beginner) spend to make examples in this book to work is more expensive than the money and time you spend on other books or FAQs in the internet. Right now, the only part I use from this book is VoiceXML Reference:TAGS part which, actually, you can find it in any VoiceXML web sites."
3,I hear the sound of music.,"This was the last album of the first era of the 4 Seasons. Half the album is 4 Seasons songs, with the other half being Frankie Valli solo recordings. The album is a mixed bag. The group's popularity was way down by this point. There were no real hits on the album, with ""And That Reminds Me"" and ""The Girl I'll Never Know"" just missing the Top 40. The album has some good songs on it, but it also has some rather forgettable songs. It will really only be of interest to serious 4 Seasons fans. The CD adds six bonus tracks, which were all either ""b-sides"" or flop singles."
5,Thurman: Mystic for Today,"I first became acquainted with the work of Howard Thurman when I found a leather-bound copy of Disciplines of the Spirit at an antique store. I was struck first by the practicality of his work, and then by the universality of his vision of spirituality and brotherhood. I am very excited to find this volume of his essays published. I hope it brings to many in 1999 and the millenium the practical, down-to-earth theology of this man who was a mentor to Dr. Martin Luther King"
4,A Really Good Introduction,This is a good introduction to the life and work of Howard Thurman. If you're at all interested in learning about the spiritual life and thought of a great thinker and theologian who was a major influence on the civil rights movement this is the book for you. This is a deceptively easy read. This work raises some really interesting ways to think about how we interact with God and with one another while also just being entertaining. I am very pleased with my purchase.
2,Too Many Holes For Me,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was fine to see alot of the more advance engine work but I wanted a more practical reference. Holes for me included characteristics of the sound system like speaker size and identification of the wires in the stereo deck wire harness, and wiper blade correction, it goes through how to remove and replace wipers, wiper motors, etc. stressing the importance of marking the wiper motor bolt ensuring the wipers are bolted on correctly but it doesn't say how to re-orient your wipers if they are already out of alignment. In my case they were out because of freezing rain and me leaving the wipers in the on position when I shut off the car.To me the book seemed patched together and some of the pictures didn't look like anything on my Crusier. I can't recommend it and I am still looking for a good reference for my '02 Limited"
4,They were the woods out back of my home.,"I did not know the location of this book when I picked it up. Soon into it I looked off my balcony and there it was, the ""Woods Out Back."" Then the characters started to form Gino was a one of a kind local fixture and very nearly the way the book describes him sans hammers. I suppose bottles would make an apt substitute. The local school, the land developments. The town of ""Lancashire"". A make believe world that was all too believable.Congratulations for taking some of uss there and back again.Slainte'Kiltone"
3,the woods out back. . .,"'the woods out back' by drizzt do'urden creator r.a. salvatore is a light-hearted adventure with salvatore's custimarily colorful characters. the storyline is every fantasist's dream: discover a fantasy realm similar to tolkien's middle-earth, and it's up to you to save the day. this is what happens to gary leger, the story's disillusioned main character from 'real-earth.' it's good stuff, but not great - which is no surprise, really, as salvatore hasn't been great since 'the dark elf' and 'icewind dale' trilogies. it's all standard fare for the most part, and salvatore's trademark action sequences are annoying now rather than riveting, as they offer nothing that hasn't been done before - wow, more goblin attacks. oh my, let me contain my joy. still, there's a certain appeal to the novel's concept, despite some cheesy dialogue and bland action segments. it's a good diversion, but little else."
5,Kelsenelenvial,"I wanted to note that this book was the ultimate book for taking my imagination on a run of what could be. And though Gary may be the leading character in the book, the elf Kelsenelelvial (sorry bout the spelling, trying my best) is truly the shining star to me. I hope that someday Mr. Salvatore writes more on him, or at very least a character very similar."
2,"Gary, the Ultimate Loser","Our main character, Gary, is magically transported to a ""Fairy World"". He asks little or no questions what so ever (It's just a dream, so enjoy it, RIGHT!). Does what he is told, risks life and limb for the ones who have basically imprisoned him in this world. Then the ending... What a loser, in this world as well as the Fairy World."
3,"Good, but check out Hip Hop Hoodios for best Jewish-alt album of the year","I definitely enjoyed the Leevees and caught them recently when they opened for Barenaked Ladies. They're catchy and I give them credit for bringing Hanukkah music to the masses....however, for hands-down the best Jewish-alternative album I've heard all year, I'd have to credit Latino-Jewish crew Hip Hop Hoodios, whose album ""Agua Pa' La Gente"" is an intriguing mix of funk, hip-hop, Rock en Espanol, and trilingual mayhem."
3,Yum!,"Well, I might give this more stars if it arrives in time for our Chanukah party on Thursday! We heard the clip on NPR (while browning kasha in the cast iron pan) and I had to hear more! One reviewer mentioned fun for ""They Might be Giants"" fans; I'd add REM and, hey, I adore the Ramones and I think these guys are great, too! Thanks!It got here, we're having a dance party, we're singing along! This stuff is great and my mom likes it, too! Five stars!"
1,OY VEY..THIS ALBUM STINKS,"This is supposed to be a""holiday""album for those who celebrate Hanukkah rather than,say,christmas,or kwanza..A nice thought,and God knows that there just aren't too many Hanukkah albums out there,of any kind...So it is too bad that this album is such a loser..The songs are neither entertaining nor particularly clever...My mother used to insist that if one did not have something good to say one should not say anything at all,but in the case of this terrible album I feel it is my duty to ignore mother's advice and proclaim loudly;OY VEY,THIS ALBUM STINKS...Adam Sandler wrote a cute little Hanukkah ditty,which is available on his album""Whatever happened to me""..the album has some dirty jokes and explicit lyrics,but his Hanukkah song is a constant delight,unlike ANYTHING to be found on this disc..."
2,Pretentious. Whatever.,"This album seems very ""put on"" with the intention of having listeners think it is not. Guess they fooled the record company though since they obviosuly have a deal and are doing well. That still doesn't mean the music is good. It means it sells. The unfortunate part of all this is that the group seems to have talent. They play well, sing well and have some cool arrangements. It's just to bad it's all wasted on a gimmick."
5,Spelled with a silent J?,"Tight, solid riffs. Subversive and hilarious lyrics on par (no, better!) than the best of Barenaked Ladies or They Might Be Giants. And, of course, terrific tongue-in-cheek Jewish humor, just in time for most bittersweet time of the year for the Diasporized.Please, don't buy this album if you are content to sing ""I Have a Little Dreidel"" all December. It'll be wasted on you--buy it for your hip nephew instead."
5,This album is Chot!,"I would say these guys sound like the Jewish version of They Might Be Giants, but I think those guys are Jewish too. Maybe they're like the Jewish Barenaked Ladies. But, wait, aren't they Jewish too? Anyway, the Leevees are a great band in their own right. Their lyrics are clever and funny, but probably only to Jewish people because when I played it for my non-Jewish friends they didn't know what kugel was so how could they laugh at a song about kugel? They did love the song about spelling Hanukkah though, because that is a problem that has befuddled Jews and non-Jews alike for centuries. Anyway, I too am so relieved to find a hip, cool band that sings about Jewish stuff in a way that isn't sad or klezmery or cantor-like. I hope they write a song some day about haroset. Which can also be spelled charoset."
2,Bought for my elderly mom,I thought my mom would like this because she liked a movie based on a book by this author. I think it was just a bit too literary for her.
1,Why would you teach your child to ignore you?,"I find that the premise of this book - Three warnings before you act teaches a child to ignore you the first 3 times. Kids are smart that way, they will catch on that you only mean it the 4th time."
2,I'm sure I'm in the minority here,"Here's what I didn't like about the book. He calls children ""wild animals,"" says parents biggest mistakes are ""too much talking and too much emotion,"" he recommends ""putting a lock on the door"" of a child's room, and says ""there may be a time when a 'spanking' is appropriate.""I don't believe there is ever any justification for striking a child. The author seems to think of children as inherently bad.I believe this book is good for parents who only have the time for the ""quick fix"" but as I'm a SAHM and believe in treating my child with dignity and respect, I'll give this a miss. Barbara Coloroso's ""Kids Are Worth It"" is much more my cup of tea."
5,Peace at last,"I can not wait to implement this behavior plan. I am starting as soon the kids come home from school. I already count, but generally my kids just ignore me. It is because I do all the extra talking and I don't follow through. I never had a plan before. I believe this will really work. I also agree with the author that is all the extra talking and the negative emotions that drag down a child's self esteem. YAY! An effective discipline plan finally. Peace will reign in our house and my husband and I will finally be in charge."
1,"Sure it ""works"", but at what cost?","Yes, 1-2-3 Magic can ""work"" for the parents, but what is it teaching the child? There are much better books to spend money on that offer many suggestions for problem solving with children, setting limits respectfully and truly teaching children. This method sends the wrong message to the child. Sure I can say, ""There is no discussion"", but I don't need to start counting numbers --that's demeaning to my child."
2,Teaches your child NOT to listen to you,"Maybe I'm too old fashioned, but I'd rather not have to tell my children anything 3 times. I like to have my kids listen to me the first time I tell them to do something. When one of my kids is having a public tantrum I want it to stop NOW, not after I give three warnings. There's something stange about calmly saying ""Thats 1."" to a child who is engaged in intentional misbehavior. It's like saying ""You have three more warnings before you have to stop."" I also think that kids need to learn from their mistakes. Saying ""That's two"" doesn't teach anything. I'd rather use more descriptive explaining so they can learn how to behave in the future. If you want some instructions on using positive parenting skills and raising kids who behave the FIRST time you tell them to try this book: Kid Cooperation: How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading."
3,Not kid friendly,"Although I have found the techniques used in this book to be helpful, I found the attitude towards children to be somewhat disconcerting. As a counsllor and educator in the area of child abuse and neglect, I would have preferred that more of an explanation of where kids are coming from when they push limits be presented in a more friendly way (towards children). I understand the frustration that parents feel when their kids push limits and argue... but it doesn't make them the enemy or wild animals to be tamed. That is the attitude I picked up in this book. I would recommend ""Assertive Discipline For Parents:A Proven, Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Everyday Behavior Problems"" by Lee and Marlene Canter... a much more friendly attitude towards kids but with the same outcomes as 1,2,3...."
1,"I am not a wimp, but this book is ridiculously punitive","I am not a wimpy parent, and I'm not one of those who thinks an occasional spank will damage my kids' psyche forever, but this book is just way too punitive, period. According to this book, every time your child opens her mouth, you shut her down before she can get out two words. Now, in my house, my husband and I are the bosses of our children, but come on! Don't kids get ANY credit for having an opinion? I usually donate my used books, but was afraid this book would fall into the hands of someone who'd take it seriously, so I THREW IT IN THE TRASH."
4,Worked with my 20 month -old,"I wasn't sure what to expect but this book was easy to read and the principles easy to use. My son and I are just entering the world of discipline and sticking to rules and this was extremely helpful in getting us to the place we needed to be. This, along with a couple of other choice books, are a good starting point for parents. Anything more than that the books begin to repeat themselves and things get jumbled. I was so surprised that my son got the counting idea so quickly. In many instances I only needed to count to 1. But it does require reinforcement. So slacking off on being consistent sets you back. Consistency is the key and this book keeps me there."
1,Nothing new,"There is nothing new in this book. If your kids are not doing what you say, you just count 1, 2 and on 3 you put your kid in time-out.If you can't figure this out for yourself or are not a very good parent to start with, this is your book. There must be better books on disipline, but I really haven't looked. I just know that this book contains nothing new.Oh yeah, on top of that, I have a hard time reading a book on disipline that mildly support spanking and the such. True, there is no outright acceptance of spanking by the author, but it seemed clear to me in reading 123 that the author did not really look down on spanking and may have even considered it a good form of disipline. But that is a side note. (There is useful information in the book, just nothing that makes it worth buying)."
2,One size does not fit all,"This book is overly simplistic. It assumes that all children are the same and will respond the threatened 1-2-3- you're in Time Out. This book lacks alternatives for children who don't respond ""textbook"". Also, I find it discomforting to ""train"" my children to ignore me the first three times I tell them to do something - which is what this book is really telling you to do. One warning. (Go ahead and ignore me) Two warnings (Don't bother to listen just yet) Three warnings (You have a few more minutes to misbehave) OK, now you're in time out. What exactly does this TEACH? Also, what about more severe situations? If my son is hitting his brother in the face with a toy truck, I certainly shouldn't be standing there saying, ""Kyle, that's one!"" I found other books to be much more realistic and practical, such as: Perfect Parenting: The Dictionary of 1000 Parent Tips. Because I want my kids to listen to me without my having to threaten them with a time out."
1,Not for all kids,"This system was implemented in my son's 3rd grade class and I frankly fail to see what is so ""Magic"" about it.....although it did magically transform my happy, excited about school little boy into a puddle of tears at the end of each day because the check marks were given out in front of the entire glass and he felt mortified. I didn't realize we are now parenting and teaching our kids via public humiliation...seriously?!"
3,Only good if you want the child to stop a behavior,"I was overall disappointed in this book which was ranked so highly. I found his approach simple and only a variation for what we already used in our home. Some of the authors ""Good"" examples of the 1-2-3 Magic approach would be unacceptable in my home because the child used backtalk between 1,2,and sometimes after the discipline was imposed.(3). The author also indicated that the use of 1-2-3 Magic was only a stop behavior (i.e. stop nagging) and gave only brief outlines of how to get a child to start an action (i.e. clean room, put away toys, start homework). I think this book is useful for the parent who has let thingstrfh get totally out of control and anything is better then what they currently live with."
4,Seems very simple and worth a try,"My son, like the Author, has ADHD. Having my child listen is very challenging. This seem very straight forward and the book reads easy."
1,Learning not to Listen,"This book is all about learning how NOT to listen to your children. I had heard about the book and thought it sounded interesting so I decided to read through it. Yuck! It takes the approach that children are like rats - don't find out what they're thinking but instead train them with the equivelance of small electric shocks. Yes, they will learn to avoid the time-outs. But, if there is a bigger problem will you ever find out what it is? Will you be there to help them solve it? Not if you use Dr. Phalen's method! While I know it will work for some problems, it should only be used in addition to listening, careful examination of the rules of the house, and true caring. Real listening is not 'giving in', as one reviewer stated. It is caring more about your child's wellbeing than about anything else."
4,"Wonderful strategies, easily modified for your child","I found this book to be quite useful in handling my 2 year old. I did not follow the book by wrote, and agree that you do need to talk with your kids about discipline issues. But his basic point is not to ignore what your kids say, but to not lecture them constantly about what they did wrong. I find this to be very pro-child. He is just saying that if a kid does something wrong, punish them and forget it...don't go on and on about it. He even mentions that any good discipline strategy is based on mutual respect and devotes most of his book to rewarding positive behaviors and spending time with your child. Anyway, this strategy may not work for everyone but it worked for me, and I am a earth-mamma attachment parenter."
5,FINALLY! An answer to disciple challenges,"I have been searching a long time for a disciplinary system that works. Who knew it would be so simple? The consistency is comforting to the children. The few times that I've forgotten to follow the rules, my daughter has begged to return to these guidelines. Imagine that. A child asking for a tough, uncompromising disciplinary system. We've recommended this book to everyone who has (or works with) children. Our son is learning disabled and the school system is amazed at how well he has adapted to this program. Thank you, Dr. Phelan!"
1,disappointing,"Ditto what Michael Polich said. More Cherokee than Creek/Muskogee - so why not use a Cherokee town name and say it is Cherokee? Or use John Swanton's Creek Religion and Medicine or Bill Grantham's Creation myths and legends if it is Muskogee? Or just make up a place and say unknown SE American Indian tribe/group/town?I was just plain old disappointed with this effort by Dr. Hudson. He has done better (Southeastern Indians). This isn't much of a literary effort or ""historical fiction."""
2,Not the True Sounds of the Genre,"There are some good songs on here, but the majority of these bands aren't really streetpunk. Streetpunk is fast paced punk music with an oi! spirit. Bands like Anti Flag, Bouncing Souls, and Swingin Utters aren't streetpunk at all. While I do like some bands on here, such as the Briggs, Defiance, LCB, Toxic Narcotic, Unseen, US Bombs, The Virus, and a couple others, I cannot say I enjoy this, or reccomend it. Not the true sounds of streetpunk at all, you'd be better off getting ""Pure Punk Rock"" or ""Punx Unite: Leaders of Today"" for a streetpunk sampler."
5,L'Enfant - Rent Now,"Foreign Drama. Young couple living in France -- father sells baby on black market -- could you imagine? Palm d'or winner at Cannes 2005. Simple and effective cinematography. Little dialogue, many subtle details, reoccurring themes. Trivia - they used 40 live babies during filming. Brother directors are two time winners of Palm d'or. Other film, ""Rosetta"", won in 1999. Amazingly, it is possible to feel compassionate towards the father. The film is subtitled and French."
1,pretentious & depressing,"I can't think of one good reason to see this film. The characters are unformed, uninteresting and, if they had not been played by beautiful actors, probably highly unattractive. The problem is that it is artfully made, and yes, the actors are good looking, so one is seduced into thinking that this is something one should be paying attention to. If you met people like this in real life, your natural reaction would be disgust and to turn away. They probably don't smell very well either. The main character starts out as a petty thief, involving small boys in his crimes, and it goes downhill from there. Way downhill. There is no moral, except perhaps that ""crime does not pay."" Didn't we already know that? Is there any good reason for making this film? Did it illumine the human condition? Was it beautiful in any way? No, no and no. Self-indulgent drivel on the part of Les Dardennes. I used to be a big fan of French films but I think their moment has passed."
3,Portrait of the Loser as a Young Man ...,"Bruno is an amateur loser. No job. No prospects. Won't work. Lives by thievery and his small-time hustles. Bruno - new father - tries to sell his baby to strangers without the mother's knowledge. For some reason, she reacts negatively when he informs her of the transaction. Imagine that!He spirals downward until he touches bottom and shows a flicker of integrity just when he is put in the slammer for purse-snatching. Can he turn his life around?Maybe but ... why should we care?Eschewing realism, the baby in this movie never cries. Bruno does, though. Due to this and the rest of his immature behavior, he is the true enfant in this film."
3,Jeremie Renier,"I like Jeremie, he is such a great actor. l'enfant is a movie that shows how on the surfact the unfeeling, is actually not."
2,One of the most overrated films in recent memory.,"This won the Palme D'Or? Absolutely ridiculous. I would call it a pretentious bore but there is nothing even artifically high-minded about the story so I would it an unpretentious bore. The main character is completely devoid of any trait that might compell us to root for, hate, empathise, admire, relate to or understand. Bruno (protaginist) is a bad boyfriend, horrific father, inept thief, bumbling con artist. Who cares what happens to him? The baby in the movie is a rubberlike being that never cries, poops, laughs. It's absolutely annoying to watch the young couple interact with such a lifeless prop. The only saving grace is Deborah Francois, who puts in the ony believable performance in the movie."
3,Fair,"Though predictable, this film is interesting. It's well acted and directed, though it moves very slowly in places. Despicable as it is, the story is quite plausible, and Jérémie Renier plays a great sociopath. The downfall of the film is that the conclusion comes out of the blue. There is no logical progression leading to the outcome, which weakens the rest of the story. Early in the film Bruno says something along the lines, ""I don't need to keep money; I find money."" This film is an example of, ""I don't need to make a well-thought out movie; I'll just roll the camera."""
5,Relevant and entertaining,"I have received Montana for the last three years. Articles are informative and often quite thought provoking. Recent articles on health-care history and social welfare in gold rush-era Virginia City relate directly to issues we face today. Other articles, if not directly relevant to me, have at least told interesting or entertaining stories on topics like pioneer women, Indian history, battles, etc. All in all, I look forward to each issue."
5,Great follow up to a great album,"I've been waiting for this album for quite sometime, ever sence picking up Highly Evolved few years ago. This album gives a good mix of songs that rock you hard, and those slow almost Beatle like ballads. I believe the big improvement shown in this album is overall songwriting, I found that the melodies are much more catchy, less plain old noise, and overall better musicianship. I would not call this album a masterpiece, no where close. But these are the kind of albums that build up to masterpieces. I beleive this album just proves that The Vines arent any other band out there right now. I enjoyed this album very much, and hope you do, too."
4,A Step Up,I believe that their previous album was a masterpiece. I think that this one is put together much better and as a whole this album flows better then their first album. Though I do think that the first album had some better songs on it.
5,Awesome!,This is a really great cd. ... This is one of the very few cds that has a wide variety of music on it. It goes from wound up punk rock to very somewhat sad melodies. It touched me deeply. It is really cool to see that there still are bands out there now that can deliver this kind of awe inspiring music. I suggest you go get this cd if you haven't already!!
4,The Vines Are Back,"The vines have returned and are better than ever, although there are no 'new' songs on the album, just songs that most people haven't heard... the re done versions are completly diffrent sounding than the original so it isn't much of a let down.Autumn Shade II is beautifuly done and Craigs voice completly captures you.Animal Machine, T.V Pro, and F*ck the world, offer the speed and energy the vines are infamous for.Though nothing is new or really diffrent than Highly Evolved I can almost gurantee if you liked it, you will LOVE Winning days just as much."
3,More Like Extremely Thick Weeds,"I have been looking forward to this album for several months now, and I must say -- I am mildly let down. Now, don't get me wrong, this is a decent album by most regards. However, it just seems like we have all been here before.Tracks 1, 2, 3, and 11 remind listeners of why they bought this CD in the first place -- to hear some new age rock performed in a refreshing way (Track 3 is especially catchy). A lot of the tracks are set to a slightly slower pace, which may remind listeners of some of the stints on Highly Evolved (stints we were all scracthing our heads about).Of course, we can't leave out the muffled lyrics of our good old boy Craig. But this is to be expected and is one of the reasons that make this band ""cool"" and refreshing. This is definately not Linkin Park or Limp --- which is a good thing. Overall, a decent album that picks you up, but then lets you down, and then picks you up again -- only to let you down -- again. (...)"
4,A Good Follow Up To Their 1st Cd,"A Friend of mine first turned me on to this band and I found that I really liked their sound. The second cd pretty much picks up where the first one leaves off. If I had to say there was anything that makes this cd different from their first, it would be that it does rock a bit harder. I am a big fan of good classic rock and good instrument playing. The Vines deliver with a worthy follow up cd, that while it may not have broken any new ground, it does deliver 40 minutes of entertaining and rockin' music."
3,Hmmm.....,"Wow...After listening to this album, the listener could have mixed feelings. One side could remember the high points, some could remember the low.This band is something I think we've all seen before....there are some moments that display mastery of songwriting...being pop and rock at once. Obviously the lead single ""Ride"" is a display of both, and upon listening to the second song ""Animal Machine"", the listener just has to think ""go back to the nineties""I'll just say, there are brilliant moments, but sometimes you just can't help but want to pay for them yourself to go back to the studio and make every damn song just as good as the high moments.This three rating I am giving them could be taken good and bad at the same time, but I am seeing talent that should be used more in the next album, and that's all i'm saying."
3,not too bad for this band,"I was turned on to this cd when I heard the song ""Ride"" and couldn't get it out of my head. And you know what, I still can't, and I've had that cd for months.I've never heard anything else from them except from this cd, which hopefully will change. This album certainly does have its ups and downs.Ups: Ride, Animal Machine, TV Pro, F The World, and some other slow song that I forgot what it was called.The Downs: Sun CHild, I'm sorry its not horrible but not my type of music.I would certainly recomend this album, The Hives are awesome and Nicholls (lead singer) has an a great voice that I just fell in love with. Do yourself a avor and buy this cd for yourslef, you won't regret it."
4,Not a shock,"For a while we heard that the new Vines record was going to be a heavy metal record. Craig Nicholls and his friends have been hanging out in Los Angeles a lot lately making this album. It is much like The Strokes' second album. Nothing new, more of the same. ""Ride"" is a great song, and this album's ""Get Free."" And maybe ""Animal Machine"" is this album's ""Outtathaway."" Maybe the last album was more about abandonment and longings for home. Winning Days is more about their past two years traveling the world. The whole time Nicholls is still paying tribute to The Beatles. Even though you can be unimpressed by this record, it may at the end be a far better one than Highly Evolved. That one was an immediate success. This one comes out at a time of the guitar band room being crowded."
4,A step foward.....,"With the 2002 debut ""Highly Evolved"" The Vines gave us an album that had stunning tracks but was barely scratching the surface of their potential. With ""Winning Days"" the band establishes itself as a true rock and roll force to be recognized. I gave the album 4 stars because I think the best is still yet to come. I believe this band will just get better with age if they stay together. This is a band I will love to see grow into the true Vines that they are capable of becoming"
3,"Pretty good at first, but falls short.","Winning Days begins with a great song, Ride, then continues with Animal Machine, TV Pro, and Autumn Shade 2. The first three are upbeat rock tracks, the fourth a ballad. All of them are very good. After Autumn Shade 2, however, there are several ballads that are just boring. Once you finally get to the good tracks at the end, your wondering whats on the radio. Look, its ok, but unless you're a Vines fan, you probably should look elsewhere."
1,Nope.,Just what we need-another band that wants to sound like Nirvana and The Beatles. How about you buy the original albums and not this crap. Maybe then it won't be a waste of money.
2,what's that song ride?,"the vines second album from the aussies bums of rock and roll and not the saviours i can say, i like the single ""ride"" it had an ergentic quality that wasn't apparent on their first album but i thought i would give them the benefit of the doudt and try again with the vines what a disappointment this album sucks just a mish mash of half baked ideas with no real voice to project the songs to the audience i've never played this cd after the first 5 seconds of the first songi really hope craig nicholas has given up and got some medicine to calm the bugger down please don't torment us with another album it's not worth it i say"
4,This isn't too bad.,"This album took awhile to grow on me, but it has done so. I expected it to be more...concious...sounding, and a little heavier (there's quite a lot of acoustic/clean guitars). To the point: Ride, Animal Machine, Winning Days, Evil Town, Rainfall, and F.T.W. are the best tracks. Everything else is...well...boring. Most of it lacks depth, but it has a nice sound, and there's quite a few sing-alongs here."
3,"Easy to slag, but decent album","Definitely not as good as ""Highly Evolved,"" which had a great mix of raw energy, youthfulness, and strangely, tuneful beautiful intimations of psychedelia and Beatlesque rock (along with a fair amount of boring crap like the useless ""Mary Jane""). Winning Days still has a good mix of songs that, while not as gripping or evocative as the songs of their first album, reveal that at least some of the hype surrounding this band is justified. Standouts include the sneering rock of ""Ride"" and ""F_ck the World,"" psychedelic and yet strangely still sneering ""TV Pro,"" and Britpop/Beatlesque of ""She's Got Something to Say,"" ""Sunchild,"" and ""Winning Days."" It's still kind of a limp album, still has some useless crap, but there are moments of inspiration."
4,"If You Liked The First CD, You'll Like This One Also","A great blend of classic rock, grunge, garage and shoe gazer rock. There are a couple of snoozers such as FTW and Sun Child, but the other tracks are good, solid rock n' roll.It's suprising that The Vines aren't more popular than they are.I find their music to be very catchy and listenable without being too cheesey or unoriginal."
2,Hit and Miss,"Swirling sixties sounds that feature ooh-la-la hooks and occasional drenched guitar (think the Apples in Stereo) meets hard rock propulsion and drive (think Nirvana), though not always on the same cut. The first three tracks show the Australian quartet's rock chops, while songs like ""Winning Days,"" ""Rainfall,"" and the unintentional Oasis tribute ""Sun Child"" show off the group's hooky side. The CD's final number, ""F--- the World,"" stumbles badly, however, sounding like a bad alt-metal (redundant?) throwaway.Standout tracks: ""Winning Days,"" ""Sun Child,"" ""Ride.""For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"
2,A meandering mess,"I have just been reading the reviews from other people on here, and I've been thinking maybe I should give this album another listen or two. Because I have obviously not heard what they heard. While ""Highly Evolved"" was a fun, rocking album, ""Winning Days"" is a little bit of a meandering mess. It actually managed to bore me the couple of times I listened. I was really expecting the album to have a lot more songs like ""Ride"", but to me that was the best song and the rest of the album didn't come close. There are too many slow, kaleidoscopic songs. Not as trippy and cool as they apparently think. I hope the Vines can remember what made ""Highly Evolved"" a cool album."
3,not as good as the first,"honestly, i was very disappointed by this cd. i really liked (like) their first cd and i had read a lot of good reviews on their new one so i got it. the only song that i really actually liked, though, was ""ride,"" and even that didn't live up to the standards set by the first one. whatever. buy this cd if you want, but if you like good music (in my opinion) i would go for something like the strokes (both of their albums were good!!) or jet.>>>THE FIRST VINES CD IS REALLY GOOD!!<<<"
5,"Great CD, LOUSY price!","Yes, this is a great cd! You can get it at your local store for $9.99 or thereabouts. Don't get fooled by amazon.com's rip-off pricing. (And the music companies and retailers wonder why people aren't buying cd's, but ripping them off the internet instead!)"
4,Winning Days!,"This is my first Vines Cd, so i can not tell You if it is better or worse than Highly Evolved. With that said i can tell you that I really enjoyed Listening to this album. It had fast and slow song which was good, and they kept switching styles which i enjoyed, the only problem i have with this album is it's only thirty minutes long!(but it's a good 30 minutes)You should buy this as long as you don't pay more than $20 dollars otherwise You feel ripped off, A very good cd!"
4,A charming and imaginative tale,"One enchanted night, under a full moon, the loners come out to walk inthe moonlight. The mournful music of a flute calls to children, wholeave their homes and walk into the woods. Dolls long forgotten comealive and begin to dance, and a mannequin walks out of a store windowand joins a male admirer for a stroll beside the railroad tracks. Thisis a short, fanciful tale about magical things than happen under thefull moon when lonely people go out to seek companionship. It was avery enjoyable, quick read. Very charming."
3,"Great writing, no substance","More like a prose-poem than a novel. Lots of atmosphere, beautiful language, but no point to it. I kept expecting something to happen, some little epiphany. Disappointing. Might be satisfying if you know ahead of time that it's light on plot."
2,Real Vapid Night,"I picked up this book because I was 'enchanted' by Martin Dressler. I also read the admiring reviews in NYTBR and Washington Post Book World.What a disappointment this number was! Ten little tales shuffled together at random. Patches of wonderful language interposed with lots of white space. This novella doesn't add up to a Twilight Zone episode, and there's not even a narrator to give you the moral of the story at the end.You don't suppose Steven could have put this together in a hurry for a little cash, do you?"
4,Gristle!,There is really some great stuff buried in here...but who has the time to even listen to 24 hours of the Throbbing Gristle Live. I managed only part of the albums. The previous 4 CD set was more concise and easier to listen to.
5,Super switch,Just right for our layout. Good quality. Would recommend to others. Have found that Bachman delivers where HO layouts are used
3,Good,"they work good, but are hard to incorporate with non-Bachman track. I like the hidden switch machines under the track."
3,well researched,"This book had an incredible amount of detail that provided me with more background on the historical points of Dan Brown's book. However, the thing that I found incredibly disguisting was how prejudiced the authors themselves were of anything that put their vision of Catholicism in a bad light. I hope that one day someone writes an entirely neutral and factual book on the so-called ""errors"" of Dan Brown's novel. I could not bear to finish this book because I knew that the rest would be just as opinionated as the several chapters I did read."
3,A Well Researched but Very Biased Book,"The book is very (very, very) well researched, and the authors take extreme care to footnote the references in every case.Unfortunately, it is as biased as it could be.All references to books and researchers who don't take Christian Gospel as THE TRUTH are doomed by the authors, regardless of their scholarship.Their strategy is principally based on making a ridicule of two books that are obviously Dan Brown's main references for his novel: ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln & ""The Templar Revelation"" by Lynne Pickett and Clive Prince.Unfortunately (again), they also take portions of Brown's novel out of context to prove how wrong he is... doing exactly what they criticize in Brown.Possibly the best read of the novel's ""debunkers"", but lacking the objective view, which I find mandatory."
1,Nothing but 300 Pages of Garbage,This book is nothing but 300 pages of two angry Christians ranting about how upset they are Dan Brown wrote a book about Jesus. Anyone who shows interest in Brown's opinion or agrees with him is portrayed as fool hearty and idiotic and those that agree with them are level headed respectable people. The Da Vinci Code is not meant to ruin Christianity and was not a way for Dan Brown to fight the Christian faith but you would never get that impression by reading this piece of lethargic whining. I could probably write a book on the problems with THIS book!
1,Why?,Why is everyone trying to disprove this book? It is Historical--Fiction!!!!....Fiction means that it is not fact....Historical Fiction usually indicates that a book is loosely based on historical fact...If you disprove fiction....that makes it fact you crazy people from the moral majority!!!!
1,...,"Carl Olson and Sandra Miesel's ""expositions"" are nothing more than a series of weak, desperate blows to Dan Brown's credibility, in attempt to refute a story that suggests something other than the beliefs that have been embedded in the author's minds. At no point does ""The Da Vinci Hoax"" present any opposing evidence or arguments that are any more credible to me than Dan Brown's historical descriptions."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This book was boring, biased, and poorly written. They assume the average American is not very intelligent and they never seem to get to the point - they're all over the place. Save your $."
1,The Da Vinci Hoax,"After reading Dan Brown's best selling novel, The Da Vinci Code, it was obvious that it was going to meet massive backlash from many people in the world who are devout Christians. The amount of books similar to the Da Vinci Hoax that have been published in an attempt to discredit Dan Brown's work is hardly suprising, as his views are against everything that the people of the world have been trained to believe. There are definetly truths in his views, however, and it would be good if people could just deal with the facts instead of blindly rejecting them before they have fully explored them. What if Jesus was married? All the people who have followed Christianity over the last two centuries have been living a lie. While that is hard to accept, it is obvious that the religious in our world need to have open minds, and stop trying to rob an author of money just because they cannot handle the truth."
3,DaVinci Hoax is Painstakingly (and Painfully) Accurate,"The DaVinci Hoax is a painstakingly thorough debunking of Dan Brown's bestselling The DaVinci Code. From minute to monstrous, each factual error is documented (and documented, and documented, and documented). If you are looking for an easy read, this isn't it. If you are looking for a book that quickly gives an accurate overview of what's wrong with The DaVinci Code, this isn't it. BUT if you want a precise, scholarly, documented (and documented, and documented, and documented) presentation of every error in The DaVinci Code, including Brown's sources and documentation of THEIR inaccuracies, this is it. The DaVinci Hoax authors are upfront about their perspective and thorough in their research. The only thing this book lacks is pizzazz -- and I don't think that's what the authors were trying to achieve. A good read? No. Good information? Yes."
5,Putting it all together,"This book is a service to everyone, Christians, non-Christians and anti-Christians. Dan Brown's book is a mess, and this careful study puts together all the evidence against it. Brown's tendentious and transparent argumentation is not worthy of an anti-Christian. At least get your research right when you are attacking Christ. Surely the greatest man who ever lived, and the Church He founded, is worthy of, say, a Bertrand Russell. But all this age has is the effete Dan Brown. The authors do the job on Code in less than 300 pages. A great read."
5,A scholarly page-turner,"I loved this book. I have read other sources of information on anthrozoology, but none were nearly as comprehensive, well-researched, and well-written as Serpell's work. This book has it all. It presents a fairly complete history of human-animal relationships throughout the western world. It also uses scientific research to assess the human-animal bond, and is peppered with many fascinating anecdotes and examples. With all these elements combined, it becomes a real page-turner. Great for anyone, whether you are looking for an introduction to anthrozoology, or you are just looking for a good book to read with your dog or cat on your lap.A+"
1,Extremely disappointing.,"Although claiming to be a study of human-animal relationships, this book offers an endless recital of man's inhumanity to man, to support the book's theme that man's history with animals has been even worse. Very poorly thought out and extremely long-winded, this book reads like an overblown Usenet message--""those other people are all so horrible, but we animal lovers are OK, aren't we?"" Oddly, Serpell seems so rooted in the very ""human supremacist"" philosophy that he rails against, that he ends up reinforcing that very philosophy. Not enlightening at all; I feel like a pall has been cast over my relationships with both people and animals. You would learn far more by taking the money and time you might waste on this book, and spending them on your own dog or cat or whatever animal you please."
4,Check Out Totally Hits 2004,"Ok, something that annoys me about some of these reviews is the fact of them listing songs that should have been on this CD. That's not so bad, but a great number of the ones you listed are on the Totally Hits 2004 CD released next month. So please save yourself some time, and check that CD out first. And I have my review up so this is just an added comment to that."
2,AWFUL,"PLEASE DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS TERRIBLE CD FULL OF THE LOUSIEST DANCE SONGS FROM SUCH FORGETTABLE FLUFF LIKE CHINGY,BRITNEY AND JESSICA SIMPSON.I AM GIVING TWO STARS FOR THE SONGS BY FUEL AND NORAH JONES.FOR A NICE DANCE CD GET DANCE OF DEATH BY IRON MAIDEN INSTEAD."
4,preety cool,"this cd is preety cool but some of the songs on it are old.here are the really stupid songs- toxic (this use to be my fav song but it is soooooo overplayed. - Bounce (I just hate this song)- me myself and i (one of the most boring songs ever) i hate everything(just anoying)- and there are a coupple other ones but i guess there are not that bad. here are some os the songs i hope will be on now 16. Tipsy, This love , roses , are u gona be my girl, and some other ones. I guess now 15 is preety kewl"
1,NOOOOOO! The Now goodness is shrinking!!!,"All I have to say is that this is not worth your money. Most of the album is rap. Not good for kids. Although, some of the songs aren't rap, they still aren't good. Now 14 okay, Now 15 the worst. What's going to happen with Now 16?"
3,too much bad stuff,"basically all i have to say is that you can't spell crap without rap, so don't even THINK about listening to it. the pop and the rock is good,but the best song it ""hold on"" by good charlotte. ROCK ON!!!!"
1,Now 15 Fails....but my predictions for Now 16,"First of all, Now 15 failed to live up to my expectations. I was disappointed big time.Anyway, Here are MY predictions for Now 16:*""Naughty Girl"" Beyonce*""Everytime"" Britney Spears*""Hole in the Head"" Sugababes*""Hey Mama"" Black Eyed Peas*""Game Over (Flip)"" Lil' Flip*""Extraordinary"" Liz Phair*""The Reason"" Hoobastank*""Dip It Low"" Christina Milian*""Take My Breath Away"" Jessica Simpson*""Miss You"" Blink 182*""One Call Away"" Chingy*""Dude"" Beenie Man*""Meant to Live"" Switchfoot*""Leave (Get Out)"" JoJo*""Freak-a-Leak"" Petey Pablo*""I Don't Wanna Know"" Mario Winans ft. P. Diddy & Enya*""Ocean Avenue"" Yellowcard*""Where are We Runnin?"" Lenny Kravitz*""Heaven"" Los Lonely Boys*""Scandelous"" Mis-Teeq*""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" Jay Z (I think it may be a long shot, since Now is known to pass by good songs such as this, but we'll give it a shot)."
2,"I can find one good song, and three okay songs - the rest..","are just terrible. These are NOT what I call music. I admit, ""Me, Myself And I"" is very good - and ""Sunrise"", ""Toxic"", and ""Shut Up"". The rest of the songs are mindless, annoying garbage. Just the fact that they would even think about putting ""I Don't Want You Back"" on it, says how low this compilation series as sunk. And the annoying, fake voice of Jessica Simpson on ""With You"" is enough to make anyone cringe. I sincerely hope this disc does not speak for the future music compiled in the series. Anyway, they missed some key hits like ""You Don't Know My Name"" and ""Yeah!"". Try better next time!!!"
5,I LOVE IT,"I love the music on Now 15. ""Now"" music is the ultimate solution to getting the songs that you like, without having to spend time copying CD'S. I have bought Now CD'S since they started, and I still think that their choice of songs are still great. This CD is really awsome, and I love 95% of the songs that are there. It is really awsome, and came out at the right time."

1,it blows!,"everything you don't want in music is here:1.- songs with no passion.2.- songs that sound the same in just different styles.3.- not one decent talented artist in here.4.- music for business, not for the art it is supposed to be.5.- all are overplayed.If you buy this, you must be an ignorant-don't-know-better-teenager, I hope you are proud to show it when you are 23... since all this songs will cause laughter from your friends to have this crap...Hightlights: The fuel song is all right.Lowlights: Britney is soooo talented, she can.... hummmmmmmmmm... well................. she can..... humm......."

3,Another average Now CD.,"I thought there were many great choices on here, but then I also thought there were some poor choices.Good:. It's My Life, Toxic, Holidae In, Me, Myself, and I, Everything, I Hate Everything About YouBad: I Don't Want You Back (it's edited, and I don't even like the unedited to begin with), Feelin' This, Gangsta Nation, Gigolo, Falls On Me, 100 YearsDon't care if they are there or not: Stand Up, Shut Up, Bounce, Shorty Doowop, With You, Sunrise, Hold On, First Cut Is The DeepestI think that covers it. Now, this is some of what I'd like to see on Now 16.1. Britney Spears-Everytime2. Janet-I Want You3. Cassidy-Hotel4. Beyonce-Naughty Girl5. Incubus-Megalomaniac6. Frankee-F.U.R.B.Hopefully they make it there with some other good songs, not some crappy filler music that I skip over, like the bad songs I listed."
5,ORIGINAL AND DEVASTATING,"Another author I never heard of (before or since), a book I never heard of, picked up off a book rack at the checkout of a local general store. Read the first 30 pages one night. Started the next night...and was up till 4AM finishing it! Absolutley could not put it down. I still tell people about it to this day, and I read it in 1992! Original, with real-life characters, it uses the ""supernatural"" not as it is used in ghost stories or horror, but as a backdrop that reveals the real-life events slowly unfolding, brilliantly and movingly telling of events of the past repeated in the present. Not an upbeat ending, but not downbeat, either. More about acceptance and cautious hope for the future, but laced with a touching sadness. To this day, absolutely one of the most memorable and devastating books I have ever read."
5,A very good book.,"Bought this book in a dollar store about 5+ years ago. Thought if I didn't like it, it was just a buck. Loved it, I would have paid 25.00, if I knew it was going to be that good. I could not put the book down. It has been passed around to all my friends and their friends. All thought it was a great read. Best dollar I ever spent."
4,A page-turner... once you get started...,"I stayed up late to finish this one. It starts out really slow and is a bit of yawn-fest while the set up the characters. Then the introduce Ginny and I was ready to just throw the book across the room. I didn't remember or read the back and I was kind of thinking ""Trite!""... but then... then... it got good. Really good. Oh, it's a tough subject, on many fronts. But it's so well written and reasonably well handled. Beautiful book, moving text, and an ending that I liked (yes, *I* liked an ending - that never happens). If you see this one, pick it up. It's a rough going read, but it's so well done and so moving."
2,"Great Flick, Poor Transfer","I was so looking forward to the release of this great B-Movie flick.... but the transfer from Cheesy is just that. Washed out looking and all-around poor. Too bad, it is a classic sci-fi stunner."
3,Line On The Bottom Of Screen.,I saw this movie as a kid it scared me back then. The only thing that scares me about it now is I paid as much money as I did for such a horrible tranfer. I could live with the washedout colors and the not so sharp picture but the line at the bottom of the screen (like the projector's frame had slipped) through the whole movie is unforgivable. I was just wondering if anyone else had the same line at the bottom of their screen. Thinking of returning this.
3,"Hey, it's 50's Classic Sci-Fi","This movie is an above average 50's Classic Sci-Fi, if you truly love them. This movie will have you rolling with laughter."
2,Horrible Transfer,"I remember seeing this when I was six years old and it scared the hell out of me. I also remember catching it when I was in my twenties at the end of long night of drinking with friends. It wasn't so scary, but fun nontheless. When I watched it recently the DVD last week my initial opinion was that it was a horrible transfer to DVD. Cheesy Videos also released Day of the Triffids (which is a good monster plant movie and it too looked......ehhhh.) Insofar as the actual quality of the movie is concerned, the story is challenging (in the sense that it makes no sense), the acting is jaw-droppingly bad, and the ending is devoid of any excitement whatsoever. If you want to see a bad movie, there are a lot of them out there that I would choose before this (such as Madmen of Mendoras [aka, They Saved Hitler's Brain.]}"
2,Just did not cut it.,Trying to forget. Slow moving. Bad acting. Lousy plot. I missed the boat onthis one. I was hoping it would get better as time went by. Still waiting.
2,When I was a kid.....,I saw this at the local theater when i was a kid. When I purchased this I was thinking it was a different movie but soon into it I remembered it from my childhood. The picture quality isn't very good and watching it one more time for me was enough just to see Mamie Van Dooren. I would say if your into the old black and white movies it's worth a look but don't spend more than a rental fee on it.
2,A mediocre SF thriller with a an extremely muddled plot.,"Even most science fiction buffs are probably unaware that popular SF author Murray Leinster had two of his novels made into movies. This is one of them (based on the novel ""The Monster From Earth's End""). Only a few good moments and having Mamie Van Doren to look at save this one from a one-star rating. The inept script and direction make it difficult to keep track of exactly what is going on. Not recommended."
3,CLASSIC CHEEZ!,This movie was hilarious and low budget like so many others of it 's time! If you want to laugh at all the unrealistic and over the top effects and acting?......you won 't be disappointed.MIG OUT.
1,Tragic,"Famed science fiction author Murray Leinster was not well served by the movie industry. This travesty was based on his novel ""The Monster From Earth's End."" The only one that was worse was ""The Terrornauts,"" based on ""The Wailing Asteroid,"" with God-awful 1960's-grade Dr Who spfx and a script by sf author John Brunner. They were both alive when these abominations were loosed on the world."
2,Be warned: 'Cheesy Flicks' DVD is a blurry VHS-dupe style mess,"So I was all excited to see this, but this release from a bunch of clowns called 'Cheesy Flicks' is strictly public domain dreck at a premium price. On Alpha DVD at $5 this might be worthwhile, but not at $10 or whatever... unless you have to have it, like I guess I do. It looks like they just bought some graymarket version at a horror convention and just used that as a source print - colors are washed out, image blurry, VHS streaks... the works! Beware... take care!"
2,Raddi's Rating,"I have always loved these awful flicks being a horror movie lover since I was a kid. I had looked very forward to receiving this movie in the mail, but when I watched it, I was terribly let down. The color is washed out and the movie is just plain out blurry. I have a VHS tape of this movie that looks better. Thumbs down to ""Cheesy Flicks"". They should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such detestable quality work!"
3,Cheesy DVD transfer is blurry and worse than the VHS,"Finally this movie has come to DVD, but the thrill came down real fast when youview the movie. This Cheesy company, from what i saw did a poor DVD transfer job,which leaves you with a kinda blurry version of the film. I have seen better, andfor now i would say the VHS beats out this DVD version.The movie itself is kinda fun...plays out like tv episode with funny music inthe backgroud for some scenes and a thriller with monster plants in other scenes.I enjoyed the movie when it came out many moons ago.....but this DVD version takesaway some of the fun."
2,Fun Movie - DVD looks Ruined by Monster Plant Acid,"Only thing that looks good is the cover art. Beware.Cheezy Flicks must hate monster plant movies. Their Day of the Triffids Disc was pathetic as well. Navy vs. Night Monsters is a fun monster flick from the mid-sixties well worth checking out, but the transfer is one of the worst and fuzziest I've ever seen and from a beat-up print to boot. Very disappointing (as was the Triffids release). I cannot believe the film was given such rotten treatment and looks like the plant monsters half devoured the movie. It's that bad!Gave 2 stars because I really have a soft spot for the film, but as was said by others, the VHS tape has much better quality than this wretched DVD.I hope a Man Eating Plant sprouts in the Cheezy Flicks Offices - Shame on you all."
5,WATCH OUT! ATTACKING TREES!,"I sorry everyone, I really liked this movie. Sure the print was a little bad. But the movie itself is very fun.Did anyone notice Billy Gray (Bud of Father Knows Best) in it? If you are crazy about B-Movies as I am, thenby all means buy this one. They should of named it ""ATTACK OF THE GIANT TREES !""."
2,"Are you a doctor, or are you looking for your own answers?","This is one of very few books dealing with Hypermobility Syndrome. But rather than beginning with a cohesive introduction, development, and conclusion of the topic, it is a collection of research papers.It is geared towards health care professoinals who are frequently encountering people with hypermobility syndrome, rather than towards the affected medical patients themselves. There is an emphasis on describing JHS patients to help doctors recognize them, rather than suggesting treatments and hopeful recoveries.The vocabulary employed required me to have a dictionary at hand while reading this book. I considered returning the book. But decided against it, in hopes that as I progress along my journey into the topic I will be able to glean more information from a future reading."
5,Great book,"This book was very informative and helpful for this condition. After I finished reading it , I gave it to my physical therapist and she loved it!"
5,Great Book,I could spend hours looking at and reading this book. As a photographer I know how hard it is to get a good candid shot and these are a good way to record our states history.
2,"Maybe great once, but not anymore","This book meant well, but we set out for Ireland this last March and found it to be horrendously out of date. We found ourselves lost for three hours in the center of Limerick searching for the hostels listed, only to find out they had all gone out of business. It also calls for bringing your own linens -- all hostels in Ireland now provide a blanket, sheets, and pillow. Pretty much the only linen under your own discretion is a towel. The beginning section is good for learning the base facts behind hostels, but it's still no longer a book to be trusted anymore... At least until a new edition comes out."
3,A P.C. Doherty she's not!,"This book is written in an irritating jump-around style, with pilgrim's tales roughly woven into the storyline in such a fashion that the reader is tempted to skip to the last pages to read the end. Also, Chaucer and some of the other characters spend so much time crying that the storyline becomes tedious. This author was clearly inspred by P.C. Doherty...and proves that inspiration alone isn't adequate!"
3,"Europe - The Final Countdown Tour, Live in Sweden 1986 (20th Anniversary Edition)",Somehow Europe doesn't translate to video from the in-person experience. (Maybe its my TV's speaker system.) The CDs of their records are much better.
3,"Seller was great, book was not","I love lesbian love stories, yet it's hard to find them. This book started out great, until a few chapters in. It turned into more sexual than most I love. ""First Times"", that series, I fell in love with. Since my girl is my first, I love to read about the passion, trials other go through, and after the reviews, thought this one was like that. Not done reading, but I have found a few. I gave it 3 stars because it was more half and half. I should have stuck more, with what I'm use too.The passion, feelings, and relationships involved with lesbians, is magical. I felt this book focused on only the basic stereotypes people have.As I said, the book is half and half. Well written, but not for me."
5,Mr. Tirone may Not reprint this book,"This is an exceptional book, worth many times over its price. However, Hewlett-packard in its ""wisdom"" has idiotically cancelled the HP17BII and the HP19BII calculators.I purchased this book some time ago from amazon and called mr Tirone for help (his number is at salestime.com/hp as I recall?) He told me that he doubted he would reprint this book and that he had a 6 or so month supply.The book is excellent and works well with the HP19BII (one of my new agents uses the book with her HP19BII) almost perfectly.Unfortunately this fine book may go the route of the HP17BII/19BII, though if there is a replacement I feel the author will convert his 17BII book over to whatever device HP stupidly replaces the 17BII and 19BII with."
1,Poor product,The Tanglefree dove decoys were a very poor imitation of the actual bird in that they were very poorly matched colorwise and the clothspin type anchoring sysytem was poor in holding the decoys in place if there was much of a wind blowing.
1,Awful Smell,"Obviously smell is an objective sense and I really like the Frasier Fir spray, but this Eucalyptus one smells like cheap old lady perfume that's been marinating in the hot sun for days. Too bad these products costs so much money, because I wasted $16 on this sneezy stinker."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED! THIS IS *NOT* THE SOUNDTRACK!!,"If I am able to prevent the disappointment of just one person, then the effort will have been worth it. I had been seeking this obscure movie soundtrack on CD for quite some time and was thrilled to finally find out, only to be disappointed when a totally unrelated CD of instrumentals arrived instead. After some investigation, it appears that the company that provides all of the album info to most of the dot.com retailers is the culprit and has attributed the soundtrack info to this dreadful CD without any good reason why. There is no evidence at this point that the ""You Light Up My Life"" movie soundtrack even exists on CD. I'm just going to have to create my own, I guess."
3,You Light UP My Life,"The contents of the tape is great, however the tape was defective and could not be replaced"
3,Not quite as advertised...,"If I could give half stars, this would get 3.5/5.I expected this book to be a chronicling of the B92 station in Serbia. However, it is more accurately an account of Serbia's political landscape in the 1990s, loosely threaded with a narrative of B92 and Serbian independent media. There is much less radio content than expected, and much more historical-political context.That said, the book is a pretty good read. It's a nice account of a turbulent decade in Serbian history, presented in a highly readable text. I believe Collin is a writer for Rolling Stone, which makes for a very digestable book.I was disappointed at how little radio content was included, but the history is quite interesting."
4,This phone rocks!,"Other then the size, this is the best cell phone I have had. The email software is really good. The speakerphone function works well and the reception is better than my last two phones."
4,A Moose for Jessica,"While visiting Vermont I was told the story of Jessica, at which time I remembered hearing it on the news several years ago. Immediately upon returning home I purchased three copies, two for Christmas gifts and one for me. I am really pleased with the overall book, story, layout, and cover."
3,A Good Read,This is far from being Ms Cameron's best work; but it is still a good read. Dialogue was good though transition between scenes was very often confusing; several times I flipped the page back thinking I had missed something. So many villains & the parents lack of involvement in the care of their severely injured daughter wasn't believable ... normal parents would want to see for themselves how she was. I own all Ms Camerons books and this is my first disappointment. I look forward to her next book.
1,Key West,"This was a completely annoying book to read. The heroine was a wimpy, unappealing person. She was described in the book as sweet, but she was boring and uninteresting. I can't believe Stella Cameron came up with such a disappointing story."
2,Mystery/Suspense-NO WAY,"I thought this was going to be a Romantic Suspense Novel, but what I read was Romance (i.e sex) and not much suspense, not even a really good plot. The Cops and PIs did not follow any of the accepted rules of investigation-follow the money, look for the paper trails. Sonnie is not a heroine I'd want to look at twice. This book left a lot to be desired, unless you enjoy reading about bed hopping. The ending was predictable, the characters two dimensional and no plot to keep me reading. Bad bad bad. Thank Goodness this was my first, and now my last book for this author."
2,Disappointed Stella Cameron Fan,"I am about 3/4 of the way through this book and debating aboutfinishing it. I found the writing to be confusing, as with otherreviewers I thought I kept skipping pages. Totally could not get into this heroine. I keep wanting to slap her, how stupid could one woman be. I too figured out ALL of the bad guys from the very first. This book was too obvious. Ms Cameron does reveal some of her villans quite early, but usually there are some twists and turns. I recommend you find some other romantic suspense to read, and avoid this one."
4,WOW - what a enthralling book this is!!! A page-turner that's hard to put down!,"Romances that are also suspense thrillers are not my usual genre, yet I was powerfully drawn to the exotic setting of this story and its likeable characters. One of the things that makes this book special is that the story is rather unique, distinquishing it from all the run-of-the-mill books out there that are different variations on the same theme. The compelling plot contained lots of exciting twists and turns: is Sonnie crazy, or is someone trying to drive her crazy; who's on her side and who's working against her; who can she trust? This is the perfect book for a steamy summer weekend, or beach vacation read. The only thing that held me back from rating it a 5 was that at 468 pages, it was a bit too long and slow-paced in some places, and I occasionally felt impatient to find out what was going to happen next."
1,How stupid can people be? It deserves a minus rating!,"If you are expecting a Laurence Shames type novel, forget it! This book is boring, predictable and easily forgetable. I too kept thinking that I must be re-reading chapters. The characters keep doing and believing the same dumbs things over and over, and over and over, and over and over.....yuk! I finished the book just to prove that I could, and now regret the lost hours. There is nothing worth recommending here!"
2,Lacking in Suspense-Predictable,"I enjoy romantic suspense novels, but this doesn't really qualify. The guilty parties are revealed early in the book and the one plot twist is predictable. The romance between the main characters is not very believable, but the secondary characters at the bar are well-written. The sad thing about this book is that the reader wanted the secondary characters more fleshed out and the main character of Sonny to just go away."
3,Not one of Ms. Cameron's better books,"This is not one of Ms. Cameron's better books. The story was really slow moving. I liked Chris the hero alot. The secondary characters,Roy Bo and Aiden, were great. I didn't like Sonnie. She was so whiny. The only thing I didn't like about Chris was that he could love Sonnie. I would wait for this to come out in paper back."
1,Don't Bother,"Not only was this book boring, I found it extremely difficult to read. The paragraph structure has the reader jumping from one thought to another in every sentence. The characters were presented as either completely unbelievable (the sister and Romano) or incredibly stupid (Sonnie). About halfway through the book I asked myself how this author could say so little in so many words!"
2,Bait and switch: the come hither of the 18th century,"The cover alone promises a walk on the wild side of Georgian England, a You ar There version of every bodice ripper ever written.In reality, this ia a rather dry compendium of stories, arranged by category of sin (pickpockets, bawds, highwaymay, foot-pads) with no real connecting link, no development of insight into the conditions and mores of the time.Disappointing"
3,A Pity,"This is not a bad album, it's just a disappointing one. Henry Butler has more talent than 99.999% of the pianists out there, but half of the disc is just pseudo-funk or smooth jazz schlock. I'm still waiting for Henry to release another disc as good as BLUES AFTER SUNSET--there's a five-star disc."
2,greaet funk but what' s that fake piano sound??!,Cant help myself but there is this cheap 80s electric piano sound I never got used to. When you have the choice between a grand piano sound and some poorly sampled sound I dont know why to go for the latter?! That spoils the whole experience to me. Band is good and grooves nicely. Snare is kracking in particular!
5,I like it,Luis Miguel and Bolero Music.. is very nice.. try it..many of these songs are 30 40 50 years old. yet.. a joy to hear
1,Better Buy,"I Also saw this - great - movie, and the soundtracks the were interesting enough for me to go over to Amazon to check out the album. But when I saw the comments, no thanks. I don't know which artist has made the intro, but the outro is a remix of songs taken from the album 'The Private Press' by DJ Shadow. I've got all his albums and you can buy everyone of them without listening first!"
1,Who chose these songs????????,"It is so ridiculous to omit the cool songs from this soundtrack. I now know who performs the awesome trailer song but could someone tell me who performs the song ""Operator"". I know they are real street singers, but can I get a hold of their music? I realize it definitely would not be through the obvious source of the movie soundtrack - too bad!"
1,Operator Song,"Operator song is sang by Manhattan Transfer, although the song in the movie is a cover and I haven't found who sings it in the movie :( ..."
1,Missing good Music from Soundtrack....,"Sorry.. Im hoping they make another sound track for Phone Booth. Where's the cool drum & bass beat in the beginging of the movie and the cool closing song ""Six Days"" during the end credits? Both of these songs I was hoping to get and arn't on this soundtrack. I don't want boring draggy scores. If your going to make a soundtrack.. PUT ALL THE SONGS FROM THE MOVIE ON IT!"
1,Missing Music On Phone Booth Sountrack,"Great Movie.. Yes.. But...wheres the cool drum & bass beat in the beginging of the movie and the closing song ""Six Days"" during the end credits? Both of these songs I was hoping to get and arn't on this soundtrack. I don't want boring scores. IF YOUR GOING TO MAKE A SOUNTRACK PUT ALL THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE ON IT!!!"
3,Looking for the Operator Song,"As the movie begins there is this great remake of the Manhattan Tranfer tune "" Operator"". Can any one tell me who is singing it and where I can get a copy of the song. It apparently did not make it to the Soundtrack CD."
2,Good score...but where's the rest?,"Where's all the other music that was in the movie? Kinda disappointing...I DO know the name of the song in the trailer though! It's ""The Shame of Life"" by Butthole Surfers. I recommend that you get the whole album on which this song is on: Weird Revolution.I wish that song had been on this album, though..."
5,Great Lasting Power,"I love Model in a Bottle. My eyebrows are very thin and light in color. By the end of the day I'd lose all brow color from my pencil and even the brush powder I put over it. Now, my eyebrows are still fresh looking at bed time. I also like the spooly option because it separates my brows and I can lift them up some so they don't look like a straight line. There's also another applicator that's like one you'd use for nail polish. It's a great product. It dries fast, too!"
2,DVD is not NTSC,"First, I must say that the music and video of the concert are absolutely first rate.The problem for some folks will be that the DVD will not play in all DVD players. The disc is formatted for Europe - region 2. This means that the North American video standard, NTSC, was not used.As mentioned in the previous review; you may own a player that reads all regions, however most players are not all region enabled.The second option for playback is to use second party software to convert from PAL, region 2 standard to NTSC and burn a new DVD.That is the option I used. The minor drawback with this method is that the Disc Menu will not function.This recording does merit whatever means are necessary to acquire and view/listen."
3,A technical guide to film making,"As a film student, this book is a useful guide in the art of film making. Whilst the information it presents is accurate and generally quite accurate, I found the format of the book to be particularly hard to follow. It is extremely technical and whilst it explains all the terminology it presents, it still leaves the reader feeling somewhat bedazzled by what is essentially an information overload. It is useful, but not interesting, which makes it a little more difficult to learn from and is far too technical too understand without some prior knowledge. This book will give you the technical skills to make films (albeit not the first time you read it), but if you are wanting more of a guide to becoming an independent film maker, I would highly recommend a great text by Greg Merritt called 'Film Production : The Complete Uncensored Guide to Independent Filmmaking'."
2,Outdated information.,"This book is good if I only was into filmmaking back in the 1980's! All of the written information are on film obviously as the book is written back in the days, however I would consider this as a film history book or a film reference book.If you are looking for books on nowadays film techniques, this one is definitely NOT what you are looking for!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Tables arrived packed OK, and the dimensions are as described.However, the color really doesn't have any red in it, as the pictures and description (""merlot"") would suggest. It is more of a walnut. In addition, the table tops are not well-done. One has a gash in it. Another is not completely finished. And a third has not been completely sanded and is rough in a section. Finally, there was no hardware in the box.Given that the contents had been resealed, I suspect that I had received a returned item. I picked this up on the Friday Sale for about sixty bucks, and it is going back."
3,"Violent, nothing worth watching here","Despite an excellent performance by Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails in so many ways. It relies on graphic violence to pull the viewer in. The Wonderland murders are all about what drugs do to people, but at the end we could care less for any of these people, including John Holmes.Wonderland is a movie that will make you wonder why they bothered making it. As many have said, hire the DVD for the documentary on Holmes alone."
1,fell asleep,"I tried to watch this. I fell asleep. I did not find anything redeeming about this movie. Watching John Holmes, former porn king, fall apart as everyone else loses his/her mind with drugs is not really my idea of entertainment, even if this was the way things happened in reality."
1,"7 INCHES OUT 11:-( VERY PORNING, ER BORING:-((","WATCHED PART OF IT ON SATELLITE, THEN BLEW THE REST OF IT OFF:-(( RENT DO NOT BUY!"
3,Good but Flawed,"The true life tale of coked-up ex-pornstar John Holmes and his descent into crime surely influenced that other movie with Dirk Diggler,a better film. Val Kilmer isn't sleazy or desperate enough to make it go. Script shows varying accounts of a true multiple murder that know one but the real killer knows the truth about.First account given is poor and unconvincing, and villians are not well established.Great timeline technique showing Holmes' girlfriend wating impatiently through a TV guide. Surprise performance by Lisa Kudrow who appearing a little older plays Holmes' ex-wife who has seen it all and just wants to live a normal life without drugs and porn.Very likable and well performed role."
4,What ever happened to John Holmes?,"""Wonderland"" is for all those out there that ever wondered what became of Johns Holmes after his iconic/illustrious career as America's ""Reigning King of Porn"" came to an end. ""Wonderland"" covers the events such as Holmes' drug addiction, affair with a minor, his estranged relationship with his wife who wouldn't divorce him, and his involvement in the gruesome quadruple homicides on Wonderland Drive in the Hollywood Hills during the 1980s.Great acting on the part of all those involved in this movie. This is not a pretty film and it takes a serious look at the events surrounding the Wonderland Drive murders and Homes' role in the crimes themselves."
2,the extras are better than the actual film!,"Presumably the director made this film frantic and confusing on purpose, to better simulate the world as seen through the eyes of coke addicts.Even assuming that to be the case, though, the technique wasn't successful. Tremendous demands are made on the viewer: unless you know a great deal about the Wonderland murders, you'll simply be on the wrong foot for virtually the entire film.Unfortunately, if you DO know something about the Wonderland murders, this film has little of interest to add.What's really great about this DVD, though, is not the film itself, but rather the feature-length documentary that comes on the second disk: ""The Life and Times of Johnny Wadd."" This is so well done that it alone is worth the price of admission: it will tell you all you ever wanted to know about not only John Holmes, but the Wonderland murders as well."
2,Dazed and Confusing Look at Graphic Murder Case,"I had read a few things about this bizarre case before seeing the film but ""Wonderland"" basically goes nowhere fast. The story is presented in two versions - neither of which make a lot of sense. This is an ugly story of drugs, sex, and blackmail that revolves around the totally unattractive but well-endowed porn king John Holmes (Kilmer, in a dizzying performance). The supporting players range from a tattooed and over-the-top Dylan McDermott to Josh Lucas and Eric Bogosian doing their standard sleazy guy routine. The best performance in the film belongs to an uncharacterically subdued Lisa Kudrow as Holmes' suffering wife. This film reminds me of Al Pacino's ugly ""Cruising"" and it is'nt better."
4,"good movie, but i have a question","i thought this was a great movie, but theres one thing i was wondering about. in the end they have a few things written about what those people are doing today. they mentioned that Dawn (Schiller) had ended up writing a book...i cannot find it. i was wondering if the book she wrote is about what she went through like in the movie or something totally different. if anyone can help me please do! feel free to email me at Jinksd4@hotmail.com thanks."
2,NOT Boogienights...don't be fooled...,"This film tries way too hard to be cool but ends up luke-warm.It truly does not succeed on any level. John Holmes is the ""star"" of the film, but he is the least interesting and most two-dimensional character here. I did not find myself engaged in the story or caring about any of these characters. An attempt at tension or dramatic suspense just fizzled for me.What is of interest here are the extras on the DVD, including an unbelievably graphic and grisly crime scene video. Now that was engaging... There is also an interview with Dawn Schiller, Holmes' then teenage girlfriend. Even though she seems to be cashing in on her connection to the story, it is always interesting to hear from the real people.Forgettable as a film -- somewhat intriguing as true crime."
2,"Dull, Plodding and Uncertain, It's Bad on Many Levels","Val Kilmer plays a drugged-out, bottomed-out John Holmes in this loose retelling of 1981's brutal Wonderland murder case. In presenting a number of competing perspectives on what exactly led to the killings, including several mildly different interpretations of the same scene, the idea is to leave ultimate judgment to the audience. Instead, the lack of conviction just results in a hazy, jumbled, inconclusive mess of rumor and uncertainty. Kilmer is miscast as the shady, self-serving loser at the end of his rope, and keeps trying to turn on the charisma when he should be cowering and sniveling. His big-name supporting cast only produces similarly phoned in performances, while a glut of gimmicky after-effects gives the whole picture the kind of sparkly, overproduced sheen that's usually reserved for car commercials. A drab, ambiguous, morally-vacant jumble that rides its barely-famous subjects' coat tails for as long as it can."
3,Interesting movie,"Wonderland is a good movie with an A list of actors. The movie is grurdome, nut I learned a lot about a crime story I knew nothing about.A good part is the documentary on the bonus disc, that tells more about Holmes and dives into info that isnt in Wonderland."
2,Interesting but no big deal ....,OK so the movie pushes the concept of Holmes and his fame as the premier porn actor but that's not what you are going to get... What you do get is his sordid and very very sad drugged out life story presented to the viewer in almost a dyslexic and disjointed late night news program ....Out of respect for Val's acting skills I gave the movie 2 rather than the 1 star it so justly deserved .....
4,FANTASTIC Blu Ray,"Most places won't have it til October, but Best Buy has the blu ray exclusively starting today. Picked it up today on sale for a crazy price of 7.99!!!Has all the bonus extra features including:Deleted scenesCommentaryInterviewscomplete 105 min documentary ""Wadd: The Life & Times of John C. Holmes""24 min LAPD Crime Scene footage6 min Court TV snippetGreat package at a fantastic price!"
4,a complete understanding of John's life,"The movie is good, not great.However, if you want to understand and inform yourself about John Holmes,this two-disc set is great.The second disc is a documentary that explains John's life through interviews with the people that knew him (manager,wives,co-workers,etc.).It is extremely interesting and honest.It runs close to two hours.I suggest watching this disc first and then the movie.Otherwise, you see only the Wonderland murders part of his life in the movie and not the whole picture.One of the special features on the first disc is the actual police crime scene footage of the murder scene.It is lengthy and quite gruesome.I am surprized that this was released for public viewing.This set runs for about five hours and if you are interested in the life of John Holmes,this DVD is superbly informative."
4,good effort,"ok, first of all i don't know why people or at least few did't like this movie!!, it said at the beginning that the story took place when ""the legend was over"", so what's everybody talking about!!!! the story is well written and was well blended with reality!!! this movie is not about the story of john holmes is the story of the murders that took place in 1981!!! but not to worry if your're interested in the story of the real john, there's another dvd (bonus) with extensive footage and story of the man known as the ""wadd"". I suggest you watch this document first, so you understand this movie first (unless you know the story) this document, tlaks of how john met dawn, the wonderland murders, and other interest stuff, so buy it.......like know!!!!"
3,Doesn't compare with the real thing,"The smartest thing director James Cox did on the DVD release of this grimy, unsettling film was to include the far more informative and engaging documentary, Wadd: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes, chronicling the entire career of the late s.p. legend. Holmes (Val Kilmer) serves as the central character in Cox's fictionalized retelling of the most lurid chapter of the actor's life: a grisly drug-related multiple murder in which Holmes may have been directly involved.Cox never allows you to care for or even like any character in themovie. Washing his actors in slimy green and brown light, he makeshis entire cast look dirty and seedy, which, though it may beaccurate for Holmes' sleazy acquaintances at the time, never helpsus care about what happens to these creeps."
4,raunchy adventure,"val kilmer plays a great john holmes. this movie is full of scandal, greed and just about covers all of the deadly sins. this movie will keep your attention. never a dull moment. i am pleased that i purchased this dvd. i could definitley watch it a few more times. and it dosent hurt that val kilmer was one of the sexiest men on the planet."
3,movie,yeah its okay it skips a lot and i even got a new dvd player and it still skips but its all good.
4,You'll need a hot shower after watching this,"A gritty and violent study of a group of thoroughly unlikeable and pathetic lowlives. It's very well acted, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Lisa Kudrow put in a nice performance as John Holmes' first wife. You almost feel like you're a fly on the wall choking on the secondhand cigarette smoke as these people slither and stumble through their stoned paces. Features a cameo by the always-annoying and vapid Paris Hilton that is redeemed by Eric Bogosian(playing L.A. drug/nightclub kingpin Eddie Nash) telling her to ""get out of here"". The bonus materials are great(how did they get that LAPD video?) and the limited edition version comes with the documentary ""Wadd"" as a bonus disc, which is also very good, arguably better than the movie."
5,VERY GOOD,"SHIPED VERY FAST, THE PRODUCT PLAYS GREAT, NO ISSUES AT ALL, REAL IMPREESED WITH HOW FAST IT WAS. JUST GREAT!!!"
4,Brought back memories,"LA the 70s. Family and funI dont know what else to say, man of few words blah,blah,blah, and then some ."
3,its god,actually buy the movie when it first thought is that I would have many sex scenes and scenes recorded when porn movies nothing that the movie is not bad since it is after it has ceased to be the exsito. not bad but I expected something moreen verdad cuando compre la pelicula lo primero que pienso es que tendria escenas de sexo y muchas escenas de cuando se grababan las peliculas porno de eso no hay nada la pelicula no esta mal puesto que es un despues de que el haya dejado de tener exsito. no esta mal pero esperé algo mas
4,Johnny Wadd,"This film gives you two points of view of the Wonderland murders. One from Dylan McDermott and one from Val Kilmer (as John Holmes). I think the sheer brutality of these murders are enough to captivate, but the film basically goes nowhere. You don't learn anything about Holmes other than the fact that's he's a major drug addict. The film has nothing to do with porn or sex. It's a true crime movie that just never really gets off the ground. The second disc is a documentary on Holmes himself. That is the better disc. It gives you an in-depth look at the life of a guy with a practical-joke sized piece of anatomy. This documentary is far more interesting than the film Wonderland.There is a 25 minute crime scene police video included as well. It is as graphic as graphic gets. The bodies are still there as the police carefully document the bloody scene. I assume it's there for shock value. Don't let your kids anywhere near this."
3,A wild ride but confusing,It was an interesting movie but If I didnt know so much about the subject matter I would have been lost in all the confusing back and forth scenes from earlier on in the month of July 1981 to a few days later. It was good overall. Liked the music and would like to buy the sound track.
4,An Excellent End to an Impressive Trilogy,"I am sad to finish this trilogy, as I've enjoyed my time with the Vaidens over the past few weeks.The trilogy began before the Civil War and continued through to the first post-reconstruction generation. Watching the South fall, rise, and fall again, all through the perspective of one family, was interesting. I felt Stribling did an excellent job of creating this world and I will miss it.That said, I don't know that this book would stand alone. I encourage everyone to read the entire series and to savor the unique look into American history that it provides."
3,"Not Great, But Not Bad Either.","Critics for the most part panned this musical Almodovarian clone about a pre-operative transexual whose dream is to become a biological woman. I understand some of their concerns, like lack of a true plot and awkwardly placed musical numbers. And, at times it felt somewhat derivative (especially a musical number that seemed like a ripoff of Michael Jackson's THRILLER). But, I was nonetheless charmed by this unorthodox, humanistic and profoundly touching celluloid poem to transgendered people. The respect it conveys to the central character makes her life, her dreams and, yes, her libido worthy of the highest form of celebration. My three star rating is more a statement on the film's less than perfect story arc than its overall message. If a little more time had been given to developing the script, this fairly obscure little gem would have done much better at the box office. I highly recommend it to those who are willing to overlook its flaws."
5,The BEST Sports game made EVER!!!,"This is not only the best EA Sports game ever, but also the BEST sports game EVER made! Very deep and easy to control. Very life like. Madden has nothing on this gem."
4,Intensely Frustrating,"The sports games for all the platforms are a total scam - you can only get roster updates until the release of the new game, requiring you to purchase the new game for $60+ rather than simply update a perfectly good game for a nominal charge. So I purchased NHL '08 a couple of months ago for less than $2.00, and it has served me well. The lag in the loading screen is a minor quirk, and I can't seem to unlock ALL of the jerseys (which is irritating), but it's a solid game otherwise. It is intensely frustrating at times, though: often times you pass to the wrong player, or select the wrong player, and it turns into a missed opportunity or a goal for the other team. But at this point the game is going for only a couple of bucks and it's hard to go wrong there."
5,The Greatest Album EVER,"If I were told that I would be forced to live out my days on a desert island, and I could take only ONE album with me, it would be Judy At Carnegie Hall. This is the best album ever recorded, and this includes all other live or studio recordings. Judy Garland is at her absolute ZENITH in this concert. If you are not a Judy fan, I dare you to buy this album and not fall in love with her. Her talent, showmanship and humor are stupendous. Buy the gold disc, because Judy is more out front, as if she were in your living room singing to YOU. I have listened to this album hundreds of times, and I know every note, every sigh, every word. Yet this album NEVER gets old. It's new, fresh and exciting every time I hear it. BUY THIS CD!"
4,"Great, but get Capitol's 40th Anniversary set instead.....","I have enjoyed Capitol's 40th Anniversary set of Judy at Carnegie Hall immensely since I bought it in early 2002. I had also read reviews about this gold edition from DCC, so I checked it out from the library for comparison. There is certainly a difference between the two. On the Capitol set you really do get the electrifying feeling that you are in the audience at Carnegie witnessing history. DCC, on the other hand, removed the ambiance of Carnegie Hall and instead feels more like a studio album with applause. Judy sounds so close, like she's practically sitting on top of you. That would be fine if this were a studio album, but this is a live concert; the ambiance of the hall makes it so much more powerful. Both editions are excellent, but Capitol's is clearly the album of choice. The DCC set is out of print and very rare; if you never come across it, no big loss.....the Capitol set, on the other hand, well....ownership is NOT optional."
4,"Great, but where's the overture?",This is the all-time best Judy Garland album -- excitement from start to finish. But the big (and only) disappointment is the absence from the CD of the great overture that was on the vinyl. That band cooks...
5,The Greatest Live Album Made,"When I was 18,The music I was into was rock.The Beatles,Carly Simon,Pink Floyd etc. But one night,my older cousin Kathy put on Judy,live at Carnegie Hall.I was blown away. I've never heard such a voice in my life. I never cared for Judy Garland untill I heard that album. And it wasn't just her that made the album. It was Mort Lindsley,the audience,it was perfection. There will never be a night like that again. From the first song to the last,it was Magic. I couldn't beleive a song like,Do It Again,was made at that time. The way Judy sings it is so sexy. And StormyWeather,Man,what a voice. My Stero never sounded this good. If there is a human being alive who can't get into this record,there something wrong with you."
4,Judy at Carnegie,"I recently read a biography of Judy and decided I had to get an album and check her out. The book seemed to think that the Carnegie Hall appearance was a smash so I got this CD. I certainly think that the album is well engineered and has a definite ""you are there"" feel to it. As to Judy, she appears in fine voice, except at the soft end, which she has apparently lost somewhat by this time. And it is pretty apparent to me that she is on drugs, as can be surmised from the slurred lyrics here and there, and the weirdly syncopated talking with the audience between some of the numbers. What a tragedy!"
2,Off His Game,"Even Andrew Lloyd Webber's lesser shows have an occasional song that is sweetly beautiful (even the rather dull Aspects of Love and the disjointed Whistle Down the Wind) but Beautiful Game seems to be lacking in even one song to grab on to. The lyrics by Ben Elton are pedestrian at best and far too repetitious (perhaps he was spurned on by the music). The performers themselves seem to be quite able, if not particularly distinctive. It does not seem the work of someone who has spent over three decades in the theatre. Lloyd Webber seems completely out of his territory with this material and only very briefly in the song If This is What We're Fighting For does the correct note of passion creep in but by then it is far too little and far too late as the listener's attention will have drifted by then. One can admire the composer's attempt to try new things but this should have been stopped before it reached this stage."
3,waiting for my replacements..,"these arrived in all their little plastic bags with cards marked ""CHINA"" - one of the bits had a nasty chip on the end and another had a burr i could've removed. this chip may have been a result of the packaging (was just wrapped in cardboard..)bearings were all solid.. i returned them in favor of a replacement set w/ no chips.. i had not used them to cut anything, so the 4 stars i am basing on a visual inspection of the un-damaged bits.. i will review again when i get a proper set.still appears to be a good value for the money, the return was absolutely painless- pack it up, print the shipping label, put it in the out going ups at work.Follow up -Weeks later my replacements arrived.. no chips, no burrs. I have used one of the pattern bit 5 times and the edge dulled to the point that i could not use it any more.. but i guess you get what you pay for."
4,Still Great After Almost 8 Years On The Market!,"After being on the market for almost eight years, Windows NT 4.0 is still a great option for people looking for a stable and powerful operating system. The OS is especially great for older systems as it only requires a 486 w/ 16 mb of RAM to run. (though a Pentium+ is recommended and helpful). Don't choose NT if you're looking for USB or games, though, as the support for DirectX & USB is skimpy at best. (it isn't hopeless, though) So, if you're looking for a good, proven OS, NT is an option."
4,i am kloot gone tuneful,"I got to know this fella courtesy of the truly fantastic Piccadilly Records in the ever sunny, rainy old Manchester. A Mancunian singer-songwriter in the vein of Johnny (Dangerously) Bramwell of I am Kloot. This chap isn't as dry as J.D. (which, for me is a good thing). He has strummy, intelligent songs aplenty and for fans of the Kloot, Stickboy is a must.If, Craig Edmondson (Stickboy), you fancy a trip to Australia, there's a spare room waiting for you, rent-free, in Adelaide! Bring your guitar - my beloved Jodie will cook the chili con carne and Guinness-es, down The Rising Sun Tavern, are on me!"
5,More Please!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a great page turner. I read this book until the wee hours in two days. I can't say enough good things about the concept, the characters or the twist at the end. I loved it. I hope Dichiara writes more. My only suggestion, because Dichiara isn't a scientist, is that he should research a little more. But the story was sooooooo good it still gets 5 stars."
4,Amazing Tale&#65533; kept me wanting more.,"A friend of mine recommended this book- I don't usually like sci-fi, but this book hooked me from the start- it was a great blend of science, mixed with a lot of intrigue and suspense. The story was riviting, and I was surprised by the ending- WOW! It was a great adventure/thriller. The more I read, the more I couldn't put it down. If you love an intelligent story, that has a lot of twists and turns, with great character development- this is the book to read!"
3,No UDO no deal!!,"Although David Reece does a very good job as a frontman, Udo will always be recognized as the voice of Accept. This is an album for Accept buffs and completists but if you want the real deal, skip this one and go to the classics like Balls To The Wall and Metal Heart"
3,staples,They are staples. Fun to shoot them into wood with the air nailer. Real use will be for upholstery work
5,The best staple for a Senco SLS 15,"Senco 3 Tool Finish and Trim Kit, Finish Pro 35, Finish Pro 15, SLS 15 Stapler with Heavy-Duty Rolling CaseBeyond the fact that these are the correct staples to use with a Senco SLS 15 (which I have), there is little more to be said. In other words, they work great in the gun for which they were designed."
4,Not the same impact on my little black and white Kindle,"My 5 year old granddaughter was curious about my Kindle so I downloaded a few children's books. Although she loves to be read to and has her favorites this didn't hold her interest. I think it wasn't so much the book, but the format. The illustrations look like they would be colorful and imaginative on paper but on my Kindle they are small, black, white and grey monotones. I explained to her that the mouse was reading a lot of books and pretending to be part of the stories. She listened a little while, but apparently thought the book was too long and moved onto something else.I think it is probably important for her that books be visually stimulating. My little Kindle is lacking in that.I would probably give the book 5 stars in paper form, but due to her reaction to my Kindle version, I have to give it 4 stars."
4,Reasonable well formatted,"The only weak point in the formatting is that what should be a Greek word is printed as question marks, for example, ""from the ??????????? of Demophilus."" Other than that, it's perfectly readable. The book is very informative. The more important writers have long articles; the one on Virgil takes 16 pages in the print edition. There is a paperback edition available for $10."
1,Bruno Sammartino: An Autobiography of Wrestling's Living Legend,"I was very disappointed and the lack of candor in this book. After reading the (auto)biographies of such wrestlers as Lou Thesz, Freddie Blassie, Roddy Piper, and larry zbyszko, i felt downright cheated by Bruno's lack of honesty as to the real workings of Professional Wrestling. When events in his book have been documented in other books with an entirely different approach (breaking of the wrestling omerta - called kayfabe) - either Bruno refuses to admit to the reader that decisions were pre-determined - or that wrestlers cut themselves for blood - or perhaps he has convinced himself that things never happened to him - in that case he needs psychiatric help. Did i enjoy any of the book? yes - his disparagement of the McMahons <haha> - all in all I can not recommend this book to anyone who wants an honest look at a career of a pivotal wrestler."
2,Bruno Is Great but book is just not accurate.,"I love bruno Sammartino but for bruno to not mention and deny that razor Blades were used back then is just bolderdash.If your going to write a book thats fine and I understand that bruno does not want to break kayfabe but in todays world Wrestling fans are some of the smartest people there are and know through books like Jimmy valiant and Interviews from people like Abdullah the Butcher,fans know razor blades were used and alot.Bruno himself had to have used a razpor blade at some time because he bled greatly in his matches with killer kowalski,Billy Graham and Stan hansen,and even hansen in interviews has stated that bruno bladed in there matches in MSG.So even though I love bruno he should come clean if hes going to write a book."
5,"Great laptop, great value","I use this laptop as a traveling IT project manager and business consultant. This machine is a great performer. The monitor is bright, crisp and color is great. Unfortunately, it didn't come with the option of bundling Office 2007 products with. So, budget for an extra $300 once you have purchased Office and Antivirus, etc.Now for the good part, when I am not using the laptop for work, game on! World of Warcraft is my recent addiction. With the settings almost maxed out, the frame rate is fluid with no flicker or freezing. Just dont try this with a power source. Gaming in High Performance mode will suck the battery dry in a skinny minute. The nvidia 7600 graphics card is an important option for anyone who intends to game or anything that requires intense video.Used the bundled software to burn mpeg movies to DVD. Worked perfectly at 2x.Wish HP had included on-board bluetooth. I had to buy a Kingston bluetooth dongle for $30."

4,Delightful holiday CD,"moe. lets loose and has fun on this delightful, funny holiday compilation. ""Together at Christmas"" and ""Home"" are great new songs, and the standards are played with joy and energy. Especially wonderful is the gorgeous slide guitar rendition of ""Silent Night,"" which goes into a Pink Floyd-ish jam."
4,Rosella,"My daughter got this one and the singing one for her Birthday in September. She likes to put her Barbies in the bath, so this one gets played with more. She likes to role-play with her and Prince Antonio. Nice quality, but then again I've never had any problem with Barbies."
4,Grandpaw for Grandaughter,"Purchased this doll for my grandaughters fifth birthday, it arrived in just two days, she was tickeled to death with her doll, and plays with it alot, the fast service enabled us to have it in time for her birthday,and the price was very fair, lower than local shops."
3,Nice Doll,"I had the chance to buy this doll and the singing one, but chose this doll because I thought her face was prettier. Does not sing and dress does not have sparkles. Also she does not have holes in her back like the expensive one because she does not have peacock feathers. Has a pretty crown and is a lot cheaper."
2,CD is not as good as I rember the tape being,"I liked this when it came out in 1980, but either I got more sophisticated (doubtful), this got worse (hardly), or it was just pure crap to begin with (most likely). The title song is really good, but the rest of this is just awful. Especially Liar, which gets on your nerves as one of those songs that you wish would just end already, as it just repeats the title over and over again. A five minute song that is four minutes too long. This has not aged well, CD is not as good as I remember the tape being. Get the Witchfinder General CD's instead, they held up better."
1,WHAT A DISASTER !!!,"I bought this paperback in a hurry, trying to find a workbook or something to help me structure some option trades. WHAT A DISASTER THIS BOOK IS. I have never seen such a poor attempt of writing a book. It is an absolute failure to address the subject. I cannot imagine anybody who had ever tried to start options trading, ever getting to first base after reading this tome. It is verbose, rambling, negative, and filled up with the perils of trading options. I was just astonished with the amateurish tone, and the lack of useful material in this book. And then, you wonder why Amazon is showing this paperback for sale at $133.00 (some weird type I guess). Just amazing."
2,Horrible book,"I have 2 years of experience trading stocks on the market, soon I'll be taking on some options trades. This book was supposed to clear up any confusion I would have about options, hence, ""demystified."" unfortunately, I was even more confused after getting through the book. It was boring, lacked graphics, and was overly explanatory on the stuff that didn't matter. It was as though the author expected you to already know some things without explanation. It would probably be a better second level read after you learn a few things."
4,Great read for Indianapolis residents who remember this case.,"This is a very complete look into the murder and trial of the Forrest Teel, a top amoral executive of Eli Lilly & Co. back in 1958. It is very well documented and well written. Especially for those of us old enough to remember the late 50's, just hearing about the places so well known then and comparing them with today is worth the time and money."
3,Pretty good,"I liked this book a lot, but the ending seemed very abrupt. Perhaps you are supposed to read River of Joy and Call Me Graywolf (I think these are sequels). If someone knows, please post the answer."
5,Amazon's packaging.,Jewel case was crushed during shiping. CD is scratched. No returns on open CDs. Thizz iz Five Star Muzik tho.
1,Bad DVD leads to bad Amazon experience,"Short story: I purchased this DVD but the DVD wasn't even formatted correctly. I tried the DVD on several players and on 3 different computers (Apple & PC) and the DVD never worked. The DVD was bad. I emailed Amazon about this. They told me they were going to send another with the correct formatting for free and well, the whole thing was a disaster. 15 emails later and a lot of confusion and stupidity on the part of the customer service department of Amazon and I still don't have a replacement DVD. Amazon is great when the items are good and correct but their customer service sucks when things go bad.Don't buy this DVD, unless you want to go through the same nightmarish experience that I went through."
3,"Entertaining, but excessive claims for central figure","This book is certainly intermittently entertaining, but makesexcessive claims for it's heroine. She seems to me tohave been a rather silly socialite who led a mostly self-absorbedlife, not a combination of Mary Wollstonecraft and Fanny Burney.Yes, women in the eighteenth century did have restrictionsin their lives, but many were able to rise above this andstill achieve.On publication and subsequently, much was made ofalleged links between Georgiana's life and that of the latePrincess of Wales, which seems to account for muchof the book's popularity. Yes, there are some, in thatthey were both born Spensers, married young, and subsequentlyhad marriages with difficulties, but also a huge amount ofdifferences, as anyone who reads the book will see.I don't think their lives spookily somehow echoed each other,and claiming they did is unfounded, and doesn'tadd to understanding either."
2,Georgiana,Not liking it at all. It is hard to stay focused when reading. The book just doesn't flow well.
1,Impossible Read,"This was a book club selection. I really, really tried to get into the book, but simply couldn't. After 100 difficult pages I just had to give up. Not even worthy of one star."
1,Disappointing character development,"I was so looking forward to a biography of Georgiana Spencer...this IS NOT her biography. It is a political discussion of the Whig party -the author must have thought a political book would not be lucrative so she cashed in on G's fame. There is no development as to why G's marriage lead to affairs on both spouses' parts. I do not have enough space to even begin telling you what is wrong with this book.DO NO BUY unless you want to read the biography of Fox, Pitt and the Prince of Wales!"
3,Love the Duchess,I am not a fan of documentary books.This book is mostly letters and and all facts...Still a good read just not my favorite.
4,Very interesting book about 18th centurery aristocracy,"I picked up this book after watching the movie Dutchess, and I think the book is much more balanced and realistic, even though the author still can't resist making assumptions(and who can?)about people's morals(like Bess'es and others). I wish there would be even more about those days culture, food, clothing, traditions, etc, and a bit less of politics, but overall it is an interesting story."
5,Very informative,I found this book to be very well researched and very well written. It gave an insightful look into the life of the Duchess as well as into the life of 18th century English nobility.
2,Very INFORMATIONAL. But boring on the political parts...snore.,"The author has done her homework, it is a very informational book. But not written like a novel or story, and less focus on her personal life than I would have liked. Some pages, and chapters especially the political ones bored me to tears. It wasn't worth what I paid for it, and it could be shortened. Informational and textbook-like...yes. Interesting...somewhat. Missing the ""entertaining"" part...yes! The movie is much better. Also note: this is the SAME BOOK as Georgiana: The Duchess of Devonshire, and THAT gets confusing. I wish I would have read the lower reviews before spending $15 at my local bookstore..."
3,Incredibly Dry,"Based on all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a fascinating read. But this book was anything but exciting. I found it really hard to get into the story. About halfway through, I finally gave up and just skimmed the rest of the book. This reads more like a history book than a biography. The author goes into a lot of detail, but she fails to get into Georgiana's head. I'm giving this 3 stars because the author did an incredible amount of research. But it's too bad her writing style is so dull. At the end, I couldn't understand why this book was written or why Georgiana was supposedly such an intriguing person. Hopefully, the movie does a better job of making Georgiana seem like a real person."
2,I gave up half way through.,"Even though I am a big fan of historical fiction and non-fiction, I could not get through this book. Too much politics. Not enough romance. My consolation was watching the movie, which took up far less of my time."
4,a great book and not a Keira Knightley movie,"This book became a bestseller in the UK, where it's okay to mix history with biography. In America, not so much. It seems to upset general readers in America to have to bother with history. This is a researched book written by a trained historian, and it's also incredibly readable. Yet, maybe because of the American movie, and the way the book was marketed here (""before there was Princess Diana there was Georgianna""), a lot of reviewers on this page complain that it's too full of history. (Also: ""not as good as the movie."") I liked it a lot. I don't want to read about personal foibles and sexual intrigue outside of a social and political context that affects decisons and choices. If I did, I'd read about Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton. This is a wonderful mix of history with enough salacious detail to keep the pages turning."
5,what a good book!,"if some one told me what really happen 18th century upper crust i would not believe them.money,sex,adultery,hidden preganacy,lesbianism,royality,gambling and drug addiction.fashion theather social scandals,politics,betrayal, blackmail and war.it's a soap opera that really happen.even a evil bestfriend who bears two childern by georgina husband is through in.this book is addictive.i didn't put it down till last page."
5,Dynasty meets the Royals 18th Century Style!,"Sex! Drama! Death! Politics! Power! Illegitimacy! Privilege!The life of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, reads like a movie. What a fascinating and absorbing life this woman led! To her fans and detractors, she was a beautiful, glamourous woman who exerted much power and influence. Her fashions were copied, her male friendships were gossiped about, her soirees were the parties to be seen at.Behind the scenes she was deeply unhappy, bulimic, a gambler, locked in a menage-a-trois with her husband. She embarked on a foolish love affair and paid dearly for it. Still, her adoring public loved her all the more.Parallels can (and will) be drawn to Diana, Princess of Wales, who like Georgiana came from the Spencer family. I found Foreman's book to be an interesting insight into a vanished world of privilege and wealth. If you are interested in popular history, then this is a book for you."
3,Very informative,"I am a big fan of historical fiction so I decided to order this one. First let me state, this is not an easy read. This is a biography so it lacks some of the flair of Dians Gabaldon or Philippa Gregory. However, it gives an interesting perspective of the politics of 18th century England. It also makes the movie much more intriguing."
3,Less is more,Georgiana is a very interesting person and can easily be compared with Jacky Kennedy in terms of popularity in the society. She had a husband who was unfaithful. People at that time did not mind having affairs and gambling was a big business even if they did not have the money for losing. However learning about history and behaviors of that time was great.Unfortunately the author spent to many pages on politics. A lot of political details were described and endless political discussions went on and on(most of them not necessary for a biography). If you skip them than it is fun to read this book. I expected more details on Georgiana. How did she overcome the problem of an unfaithful husband and the mistress living in the same house ...
3,Not at all what I expected,"This book was a big disappointment for me. I love historical novels, anything British, and biographies. I do not read romance novels or the like. So that's not what I was hoping for. But the way this is written is very dry, factual, and really doesn't read like a story. Georgianna did this, then she did that, and wrote to so and so... (boring)There is no dialogue in this book. I've certainly read many interesting and engaging biographies and this is not one of them, sorry to say.I give it 3 stars because of the amount of work that the author obviously put into it."
5,A beautiful book,"I just loved this book. I learned a lot about the time, and about an amazing women. I found the book to be heart-wrenching and sad. I love and hate Georginia. She is the most dynamic person I've read about in a long time. I only wish I could have known her."
4,Fascinating portrayal of a spirited woman,"Foreman really draws the reader into the interesting life of Georgiana, one of the most influential women in 18thC society. This is a very well-written portrait and makes for great reading. It contained a bit more about the politics of the time than is of interest to me, but for those interested in such things I imagine all of that was entirely riveting. I was most interested in Georgiana the woman and what motivated her, and here Foreman did not disappoint. An excellent biography and an eye-opening look in to the 18th Century."
3,The book The Duchess,"The book is very interesting and chock full of quotes and little-known historical facts. However, all of that did not make for a good read. I'm glad I read it but it's hard to recommend this book because it was laborious to read."
1,Boring,"I bought this book because I wanted to know about Georgiana and her personal life, about the events in her life and her history.. but what I found here was mostly her associations with Politics. I find that very boring.I am interested in her life, not Politics. I would skip this.. I wish there were other biographies of her."
4,Hard to find versions!,"Years sgo I read that the Diamonds had copied the original of Little Darlin' virtually word for word,after hearing the gladiolas version on this cd I can understand how the rumour was started.When I recv'dthe cd I discoverad it was defective.I e-mailed Amazon and recv;d a new cd in four days ,with no muss or fuss."
3,Item Picture is WRONG,"I ordered the double talk charger from Accessory One. The item pictured is NOT the one I received. I called and although the company was courteous, they explained that the item picture is discontinued. The unit I received is bigger, not as nice, but does work. It offers most of the same features. I explained I felt bait and switched. They said anyone can change the pictures-they cant control that. The best they can offer is a refund, but I would still be out the shipping charges to return it. I am very dissapointed in paying for a product that is not what was advertised, not being notified about the change, unit was admittedly not as nice as the old model according to Accessory One supervisor but...tough luck. I am out money if I return it, or just have to put up with being shown one item, and delivered one of lesser quality."
2,Great movie? No. Great fun? Yes.,"As far as movie-making goes, there are some serious issues here. As far as campy fun for those of us from South Dakota, there are some serious nostalgia factors in play.Without giving all the locations away, let's just say if you are familiar with the northern Black Hills you will recognize several spots. It's fun to see the Deadwood area way before legalized gambling took over.The story needs a lot of help and the not-so-special effects are horrible, but it had me thinking about what a modern remake would be like."
1,"Avoid this version of ""Watto Sitta""!!","There are a few versions of this album out there, but the version pictured here, which is on Terrascape Records, is a waste of money no matter how cheaply it may be advertised. Only two or three of the tracks have decent sound quality. The rest are dull and muddied, as if they were recorded through a wall. One track actually starts out fine, then becomes muffled half way through! I repurchased the album on the Celluloid label and the sound quality is consistently good. The music itself is tuneful and pleasant--very upbeat--and features Herbie Hancock as a guest artist on two tracks. I would suggest contacting the seller to make certain that they are not offering the Terrascape version, no matter what the photo information implies.Note: I only gave this a one star rating because Amazon's procedures wouldn't let me give it zero stars!"
1,Inconherent,"A melange of mumbo-jumbo that is esentially unwatchable and unbearably boring. Adds little or nothing to our understanding of the Unabomber or the emergence of the internet. In addition, this film does not provide captions or subtitles when English is spoken, and this may be a major deterrent for viewers who rely on them."
4,Nice Reference Book.,"This is not a story, but rather a collection of very short stories on each of the American presidents. Every author is a member of the Society of American Historians, and each chapter is written by a different author. These micro-bios average only 5 pages. The second half of the book is filled with transcripts of important speeches, including Inaugural Addresses, and much is devoted to campaign memorabilia. The book then is more of a handy (albeit limited) reference work, most suited to coffee-table duty."
4,Resourceful book!,"This is a very resourceful book, with rare pictures of campaign memorabilia and of the presidents, as well as nice brief chapters on each of the presidents. I was particularly pleased with this book because it included all the inauguration speeches by all 41 presidents. Most books have either one or the other (the biography of the president or the speech), but this book is a gem because it contains both! Though the text is a bit small to read, it could be enlarged a bit (this is with me using reading glasses, by the way).A very resourceful book to have, and well worth the price."
2,Defective Product,"While the bulk of the book is spectacular (the essays about each of the 43 presidents written in an almost poetic but informative style) the product itself was manufactured improperly. Abraham Lincoln appeared twice, Page 146 skipped backwards to page 114, and several presidents were left out."
3,"Interesting, but Slanted","Lot of good information and a quick history, but the authors seemingly never met a government regulation or expansion that they didn't approve of. They provide an interesting service in showing that the political leaders, including the presidents, have generally been largely incompetent and hypocritical, with little understanding or regard for the principles of the Constitution."
3,Good but a major flaw,"As noted below, this book offers a good, brief review of each president. One MAJOR flaw -- the editor allocates as much space for the presidents of little significance as for the giants. For example, William Harrison, whose presidency lasted one month, gets as much analysis as FDR. I would expect someone of James McPherson's caliber to have fought his editors harder on this issue - or was he himself committed to some misguided notion of ""fairness""?"
1,I dont own this...,"I do not own this CD (i am PROUD to say). Just looking at most of the Artists on this CD makes me sick...this is just an excuse by MoS to release a new CD, and make revenue off of the US. By using songs that many people have heard before in their original versions, they are hoping to get more American buyers. This hopefully helpful to you to avoid this CD at all costs. If you like this sorta commercial style...hey, go for it. But just remember...you're ruining the scene for everyone else."
1,does not work with out ferry corsten!,"simply aviod this onethe sound quality is terrible,and the songs are too commercialall the others in the series rock ,this one woobles!"
3,its not THAT bad...,"Alright - I admit it is absolutely nothing like what I would expect from Trance Nation (Ferry?.... where did you go?)... but I am an 80's junkie and loved the remixes - I thought Snap's 'Rhythm' was kinda cool. It is a fun album, but you can't listen to it expecting the beautiful trance that was many of the previous ""Trance Nation"" discs, and I reeeeally wouldn't recommend it if you have a headache or had a long day (too much pounding), and a few of the songs are rather annoying. I thank my lucky stars that I downloaded it, because I would be mad if I spent [$$$] for it."
4,Great. Not as bad as they are saying.,i know i know. this is labeled Trance. but a lot of it isnt. but its still a great comp. many stand out songs. one of the best being Heaven sent (#16) many beautiful songs. one of of kind remixes. very energetic. love it.
2,This is not Trance,"It is a shame that in the U.S. market ""trance"" has become the label to slap onto any repetitive electronic music. Sameness does not equal trance. What we have hear is what 90's raver kids are now creating that they are ""adults"" - moribundly repetitive loops without style or soul. Real trance music moves you and helps you transcend into altered states of being. This is pablum for the new raver masses. Look elsewhere."
1,Pants Nation 2003,"I was very disappointed with this so-called Trance Nation. This does not compare to the previous excellent albums, which had quality feel good tunes and excellent mixes. The 2003 album contains mostly re-hashed songs set to a monotonous tuneless 'bashing-type' beat, that sounds like it's straight from an old casio keyboard. The music was more like a repetitive hammer to the head. Don't bother."
5,Great Purchase,"I've never been able to get a Trance Nation Cd in my area, yet I saw this one copy behind the counter of my local music store and immediately snatched it up at a bargain price of $$$!! Wonderful compilation for the trance fan, although I can't compare it to the others that have come before. I highly reccomend this CD."
5,Good chain.,"I was hoping for a little more shine/bling with this chain. It is still nice though, can't complain, the price was right."
