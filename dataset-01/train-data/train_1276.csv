2,Ok sound...terrible cable,"Not to get too long winded, I bought as an inexpensive set of headphones for my ipod. Pretty decent reviews. Received the headphones and was satisfied with the sound. HOWEVER, every time I touched the jack I got a terribly static like sound. Definitely wasn't going to work. I don't recommend due to the jack issue. Maybe a fluke but nonetheless..."
4,excellent for the money,"I have little ear canals and these were comfortable for hours at a time. The sound was great and I loved the offset so they could hang around my neck when I took them out. Cord was a bit flimsy and broke after some admittedly heavy trauma, but I think it would have broken under much less stress."
3,Good sound but flimsy,These have great sound but not better than the skull candy in my opinion. The thing that concerns me is the durability. The wires are very thin and delicate. I don't think this is for someone who likes to roll up the buds and put them in your pocket. The other thing I don't like is the shortness of the cord and the fact the cables to the earbuds are not the same length. Why to they do this. all the weight of the cable hands off one earpiece which eventually works it out of your ear if you are active. I would only buy these if I got a great price because I don't think they will last too delicately built.
3,too sensitive to external disturbances,"the sound is fine, though a bit higher than the original Sansa headphones I have for my player. They fit nicely and comfortably inside the ear canal. The only, but potentially serious, problem with this product is that its cord is sensitive to every little tap, even of the hoop earrings dangling against the cord. It makes you feel like you are a diver under water surface and feel noises coming from outside world. So if you sit and listen to your music - everything is fine, but if you walk or jog - it could be very unpleasant."
1,Did not expect such cheap from sennheiser,"I am really disappointed with the piece i got on 24th. It has a noise when no song is playing, and the chord is not good if i movie the input pin a little there are cracks and jerks which are irritating. This happens with iphones. there is always a noise in background which i can hear clearly when song is not playing. Only pro is bass is good, so good for pop hip hop guys. I did not got a chance to test it like.. using it continuously for 2-3 hours to see if it has any itchy or load feeling on my ear. I had big expectation from sennheiser and did not expect such a poor quality. I doubt if the merchant HDMI king has given me a duplicate??Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)Chaitu."
4,Great earbuds,"I've tried several brands and these are the best for the money. Very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that they are designed with a short cable length on one side which I find annoying. I can't imagine why they designed them like that. Other than that, I am very pleased with them and would recommend them."
4,"Comfortable, Good Quality, but the length!","I ordered this as my third pair of earbuds for my ipod. They were nicer than the previous two, including the original apple earbuds. They are very comfortable, and went in my ear better than the ""jbuds"". They fell out of my right ear more than my left, however.At one point, one of the covers came off, so I didn't use them for a while. I found it a few days later, but the point is that they aren't the most secure. Another thing is that the lengths of the wires are not even, as stated in the description. The length is like that for running, but the thing is, if you go running with them, you can't hear anything, such as traffic. Therefore, because the length makes everyday use incovenient, these earbuds wouldn't be my top recommendation for you.Good Luck browsing!"
3,Great sound for the price,"These headphones give you great sound for the price. The picture does not show that they have an asymmetrical yoke, that is that the right headphone connects close to the left and from there to the jack. I personally hate is design as the connecting wire is always too long and gets in the way."
2,Sennheisers?,These earbuds are not what they're cracked up to be. The sound on them is tinny and cheap. Attempted to contact the seller to rectify the situation but was ignored (I never received a response from them).I definitely would not recommend their purchase!
3,A year's life,I purchased this item in September 2008. Now in October 2009 the sound has dropped from one bud. That's not a very long life.Besides that I've liked them fine.
5,Sennheiser - satisfaction guaranteed,"It was on sale at Amazon, I ordered two of them. They arrived before the scheduled delivery date. Perfect earbuds, you cannot go wrong with it."
4,They honor their warranty,"I bought these about 2 yrs ago when the price was in the mid $50 range. After a yr of use, left channel became distorted. I threw them in a drawer and forgot about them until this past October...with 2 wks left on warranty. I shipped them back with my Amazon.com receipt. Today, I got a brand spanking new set. They honor their warranty, I still question the quality. That will take time to determine. So far, very pleased with both sennheiser and Amazon.com"
5,"Excellent earphones, but not for everyone","- Quality is very close to what I heard from the Bose $90 ear canal phones in Target- [...].Good For:-Listening to music in workplace, home etc, while working on comp-Times when you are sitting in one place-Times when you want good music in noisy environmentBad for:-Jogging/Gym: noise of cord rubbing against clothes disturbs, and they do fall out.Pros:-awesome bass-sturdy build-variable size buds-very good reproduction of faint sounds, across the range-very good noise cancellation - cant hear yourself typeCons:- noise cancellation - when you dont want it :-)- no case- Sound quality depends a lot on the fit, so you have to take time to fit it properly- The PET packaging takes 15 minutes of hard work to open :-) But then, if you dont get that packaging, beware - you have mostly ended up with a fake. These are the most faked earphones around."
2,Pros and Cons,"Pros:Extremely durable-Plastic covered lines are unbreakable by slight damages.Above Average Sound-Decent bass and average acoustics.Cons:Short Line: For anyone taller than 5'10"", this will be very uncomfortable when walking and exercising.Uncomfortable-Although it comes with 3 sets of ear plugs, the buds feels very uncomfortable in ears and often falls out."
3,Very modest upgrade to stock iPod headphones,"These headphones are OK. They are about the same quality if not a modest upgrade from the stock iPod headphones - they do a little better job of sound isolation and a lot better job with bass. However, they are missing mid and high frequencies. If you've ever tried a really good pair of headphones, you notice a sense of space which I believe is brought in by the mid and high frequencies - you do not get that feeling with these headphones - even on strong vocal music. So... for the money, you're getting what you pay for - I don't regret the purchase... but some day when I'm rolling in it I'll drop $150 for a good set."
3,"For sitting, not for walking","These headphones are perfect for taking the train or flying. You get good sound quality and decent sound isolation for the price. They are obviously compact - perfect for the traveler. The problem is I do a lot of walking and the way these things are designed, you hear every footstep in your head. In fact just bumping the cable is audible like tapping the side of your head.The bottom line is that if you aren't going to be sitting still when listening, do not buy."
1,Had I only known the cords were designed this way I would have never purchased,The only thing I hate in a set of headphones is when they are designed with the right ear plug being the main (long) wire and the left ear plug is a shorter wire that comes out from the main right wire. This is a design feature that is so incredibly uncomfortable to me that I had to throw these right into the junk drawer. I wish the manufacturer would have stated this. What a waste of money.
2,Worked OK while they lasted.,"Sound is better than most stock earbuds, and they are very good at shutting out external noise. Takes a bit of work to get them sized up & fitted correctly, and after that it still takes a while to get used to them. If you get them fitted in your ears just right, they have good frequency range for earbuds, but if you don't, the sound quality seriously suffers.Would have been happy enough with them but after about six months, sound from the left earbud failed. Got them pretty cheap so it's hardly worth it to try to RMA them, even if they are still under warranty. I have the HD580 and HD560 Sennheiser headphones and the sound on those is fantastic and they will last forever. A big reason why I bought these is because I thought I'd get the same sort of quality in these earbuds. It's disappointing to see Sennheiser put their name on an unreliable product."
3,Very Weak Bass,"I am not a fan of heavy bass at all. But I do like SOME bass. These ear buds aregreat for mids and highs but are very weak on the base. I'll keep thembut will be looking for something better. Overall, disappointed."
2,its not enough,"these IEMs barely provide enough value even for its $22 price tag. it is fairly comfortable and looks decent. it does not last too long especially in regards to wax tolerance. more importantly, there are other IEMs that beat this out on value. Meelectronic's M6 comes to mind,as well as couple others. check out head-fi.org for competitors around this price."
1,Not for outdoor use,"Bought these for running -- regret it now. They significantly amplify the ""whistle"" from wind. Cord bouncing also produces a very noticeable clicking noise. They also do not stay in my ear as well as my last ear buds, but that could be just me. Sound quality is good as long as you're relatively still and not outside. I absolutely hate the asymmetrical cord -- real PITA -- doesn't hang down naturally and pulls to one side. Regular ol' Y style cable seems to work best when active."
1,Busted ear bud,"I received the ear buds in working conditions. However, within two weeks of receipt, the right ear bud busted.On the other hand, while the ear buds did last, I enjoyed using them."
4,Mother of BASS!!,I've got to tell you... This is by far the low-cost best bass earphones that I have seen... Every aspect of the earphones is positive expect for the joint of the two sides (I don't know the technical name for that but you get it). It looks a bit flimsy and a tug could cut it. But I would rate it 5 for its performance and 4.5 overall...
3,Good sound but dislike construction,"These were purchased as a replacement for my aging CX-150 set. Although the sound is good I won't be using them because of the cord. Two cord ""features"" I dislike very much is the asymmetric design and the thin/flimsy cabling.The cord on my ""lesser"" CX-150 headphones is robust and has withheld being wound up for storage/travel very well, but the thinner ribbed cord on these CX-300 earbuds gets tangled too easily and the runners into each earbud is very thin/fragile. The description of this earbud did not mention asymmetric design and I failed by assuming Sennheiser would use equal length runners on all of their earbuds. For me the asymmetric design is an epic fail. These earbuds are destined for the reject heap in my office if returning them turns out to be a hassle.I despise these compared to my CX-150 buds.rich"
1,Two of the three pair I own have stopped working!,"Like the title says, I bought one pair of these for my wife and she liked them at first, until they stopped working out of one of the ears buds. So since she liked them I bought her a replacement pair thinking it was just a fluke and just ordered an extra pair for myself. My pair has now stopped working out of one of the ear buds and we are down to just one pair again. I ordered a different style and manufacturer this time and we will see how it turns out."
5,terrific noise-reducing earphones,"I love these earphones-they are comfortable inside my ear, stay in place, and reduce noise enough for me to keep the volume low on my ipod. I can even listen to music on the train without blasting my ear drums! Unfortunately, they keep creeping up in price, undoubtedly because more people are discovering how awesome they are."
4,Sennheiser = great sound for the price,"I actually bought 2 of these, each for around $20. The rubber piece around the chord of the left earbud broke due to my negligence on the first one, but it was still working (just uncomfortable to wear). I lost the second one while traveling. I now use the CX300 II, which is much better than this IMO.Pretty durable, extremely comfortable, and great earphones to study with as it plugs your ears. I love how the chord goes around the back of your neck, which adds tremendously to your comfort.Only bad thing is the sound (which is great for $20 headphones). I found the treble to be too high, and the bass to be too low (I am a fan of a flat equalizer BTW), but this is common to all earbuds around this price range. This is still 4x better than the earphones that come with iPods."
4,Great value,Only thing that could improve is making them more durable. This is my third pair and they are good for a year each until the cord deteriorates or they short out (but I take mine to the gym 5x a week so I'm very hard on them). Great value. They sound as good as $350 buds.
5,comfortable fit,I like the comfortable in ear fit as opposed the hard plastic jam into the ear type. And the sound is good.
3,The wiring on this set feels delicate and easy to damage.,"While sonically this product is okay, the wiring gives it a cheap appearance. The uneven length of wiring for the left and right earbuds are a problem for me. Somehow I always seem to accidentally yank one or the other earbuds out. I have never had this problem with earbuds with left and right wiring being of equal length."
2,Ehhhh.,"After the first day of using it, the right ear started buzzing every once in a while, after a couple weeks the buzzing does not go away."
2,Disappointing value from Sennheiser,"Sennheiser does not provide any type of protective case for the earbuds or for the 'extra' ear cushions. After cutting and slicing out this product with scissors from the typical nasty sealed plastic packaging, you're stuck with all of these very fragile parts, and with no place to save and protect them when not in use. The earbud wires are incredibly thin and fragile, and I don't believe they will survive everyday use. The only thing impressive about this product is the `Sennheiser' brand name; otherwise I've seen similar 'cheesy' products at the 'dollar' store for far less money!"
4,Yes they may be cheap knock-offs but they are cheap,"I have bought 3 pairs of the cheap knock-offs so far, two for me and one for my wife in a little over a year. My first pair crapped out after about 5 months but they still kind-of-worked so I used them until the right ear piece gave out completely (within 6 months of purchase). My wife uses her's much less then me and they are still working perfectly. My second pair is about 6 months old now and I use them about 10 hours a week at the gym and running. They take a beating and for the price I am happy with what I got. I would recommend them for the sound quality vs. price comparison. Yes they may break and that would suck but it is a good risk in my book."
2,Disappointed!,"So I bought these earbuds b/c I lost my Sony ones, and b/c of the positive reviews on here re: sound quality. I admit to having a critical ear, but these earbuds are sorely lacking in this area. They're heavy on midrange and harsh, tinny highs, and almost no bass - contrary to many of the reviews here. My Sony pair wasn't expensive, but had far more range in sound than these things, including bass. The Sennheiser's sound like you're listening through small soda cans, to simplify it.The only positive I can give em is that they fit in the ear well, and are far better than the ridiculous earbuds that come with the iPods in fitment.Overall, unless you have zero concern re: sound quality and are satisfied w/ the sound of your stock iPod buds, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Muffled sound quality,"Too much bass response and the sound is muffled really bad. The price is good and the noise blocking is good but if you want really good sound quality, get something else."
1,"Lack Bass, sound is tinny","These earbuds sound very tinny and lack bass. The basic earbuds that came with my ipod sound so much fuller and have much more bass. I was looking for an upgrade in sound and these earbuds sound worse. If you like rich, full, bass sound, don't buy these."
4,Great Product - poor packageing,"TheseSennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)just arrived on my door. I plugged them in to my Ipod Nano and was surprised by the great sound and noise cancellation (I had to switch to the small plugs). I have the stereo on and a small space heater next to me and I can't hear either with the earbuds in.The cord is long enough. the only thing was the packaging. It was one of those crappy plastic blister packs that you must have a razor blade to open.UPDATE: I have had these for 2 years now and I still love them. they have held up to the test of time. I travel alot and the noise isolation is outstanding. even when not listening to anything I keep this in just as ear plug on the airplane. I have tried other buds, when I though I lost these, but they all felt and sounded like Junk. Next time I loose them I am buying an exact replacement set."
1,Cord Length is ridiculous,"I never post reviews and I'm not incredibly critical when it comes to products this cheap....that said the cord length is so awful that these are going straight in the garbage. The left earpiece cord length is about 6 inches - that's fine. The right ear cord is about a foot and a quarter - no exaggeration. I saw that these were rated highly on amazon so decided to give it a shot. I really regret not reading the one star reviews - which I usually skip - because I'd have $25 buck still in my pocket. Now I'm going to have to go out and buy another freaking pair of cheap headphones when I could've gotten decent ones for $50. If your thinking about buying these and don't mind a insane amount of cord drooping from your right ear, by all means go ahead, sound quality and comfort are both ok, but for me I couldn't handle right earpiece cord long enough to hang myself with."
4,four months and loving it,"There are sellers selling fakes. So if you have a bad pair, check it's authenticity.I've been just using the stock ipod earbuds for years. I finally got frustrated after a few years. The rubber kept tearing off and fairly uncomfortable after a period of time.Sennheiser CX300s are great. The quality isn't great on my netbook, but it's because of the netbook audio specs. For someone who isn't an audiophile, these earbuds sound great with my ipod. Also the sound isolation is very helpful for a college student with 3 roommates and likes to study at home. I just turn on Pandora and they don't exist (if they make loud noises, then yes they are audible but not bothersome). I can't speak for durability. I keep them in a tin case so they aren't squished and whatnot. The wire noise isn't bothersome when you have volume up enough to not hear someone speaking to you -- which isn't too high.Very satisfied."
3,odd cord lengths,"I had some Sennheiser earbuds before, and they were awesome! Braided wire on the cords, nice fit, etc. I thought I was buying more of the same with these.These were not the earbuds I was looking for.First of all, what retard likes the unequal length cords to the earphones? They tend to hang the weight of the whole ensemble on one ear, with the other earbud an afterthought draped across your chest from one side to the other.Other than that, they are fine. They have ""normal"" cords, not the braided wire ones I was looking for.So, if you get a good price on these, and you are aware of the ""alternative"" cord length, rock out. Otherwise, move on."
3,Not the best..but ok for the price,i recieved it with a left side working worse than the right...a slight difference..but it is still there...ofcourse i didnt return it to pay a 6 $ extra shipping on a 16 $ earbud!although any of the low priced philips sounded even better..this one is...just ok..not really good base nor full sound nor real noise cancellation though!
3,Earbuds handles the basics,"Fair price for the the ear buds. Sound is ok. Imaging and frequency response are satisfactory. Not audiophile level but does the basics if you just want something to listen through while on the subway, working, or exercising. Only true complaint is the cord is on the shorter side so if you are working from a computer and you try to swivel around your desk the cord will undoubtedly yank you back."
3,"Good sound, but comfort/cord length bothers me","I bought these after I lost my Sony MDR in-ear headphones while walking through the crowded streets of Times Square. I can't remember well enough to compare this Sennheiser sound quality to what I previously had with Sony's, but it certainly is good enough for casual listening and does a good job of blocking out sound during my commute.I'm a little disappointed by its comfort though. None of the bud sizes seem to fit my ear as well as the ones I had from Sony. I always find them sliding/popping/dropping out from time to time. And compounding the problem is the cord length that is shorter than what my old Sonys were. I find the cord is just taut enough that sometimes while walking my jacket or something can slightly tug on the cord and pull it out of my ear. Frustrating indeed..."
3,falls out,"I cannot keep the buds in my ears. Freguent changes of the bud covers does not help. Other than that, sound is good with my Sony am/fm portable radio."
5,Great sound,"Just opened the package to give these a try...WOW. I have a set of Sony earbuds that cost 2x these, and they do not compare. Great purchase...I would recommend these to anyone looking for a reasonably priced set of non-active noise reducing buds."
3,Good value,"Light. Good quality, but not as good as my Shure earbuds. Getting a good fit takes some time but the earbuds come with 3 different sized plugs to help."
3,"Good Sound, Short Life","In terms of sound quality for the dollar, these are pretty hard to beat. However, after 2.5 months of use i realized that the sound quality comes at the price of poor craftmanship. All the sound from the left ear bud just disappeared one day, never to return. Oh well, it was a good run while it lasted."
4,Not Bad at All,"I happened to catch these guys on sale and am happy with the purchase. I've owned some different types of the higher-end buds but they've all become damaged in one way or another, so I ordered the CX300's (pretty much out of randomness) and found them to do the trick. Overall they have a smooth frequency, good response and although the bass isn't ""boomy"" it's still present and alive.One thing to note however, the cord is a little short for these guys (barely reaches into my pants pocket) and I had to get a small extension for when I'm walking around or whatnot."
4,Great Product....Awesome Sound Quality,"The Sennheiser CX300 Earbuds are a great deal for the money. The sound quality is great, and they look very nice also. When you figure out which size buds to use, the bass is great, so s the treble and mid-range. Overall Great Product!!!!"
3,Fair Quality For Economy Ear Buds,Certainly not a bad deal for the price I paid ($15.99). They are definitely not a bass driven sound like Sennheiser claims. They have a fairly bright sound. I get much better bass from my V-Moda Vibe ear buds. I gave the CX300's at least a 15 hr break-in before comparing them to my Vibe's. They're a good backup set but they will not be my primary headphones. The asymmetrical cord length is not my favorite but it works and I didn't seem to be getting feedback through the cord.
4,A Disappointment,"After reading the reviews and the total number of reviewers, I bought this product. I have a 3G Ipod Touch and the earphone that comes with it is too big for my ear, thus too painful. I love the fit of the Sennheiser CX300-B, however I was disappointed as the current earbud that came with my Ipod Touch has a much, much better bass."
1,Stick with stock earbuds,"Read the glowing reviews for these when I lost my Zune stock earbuds, and decided to go for it. A cheap mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. I use my Zune while working out at the gym, and as soon as I started up my playlist with these connected, I noticed cracking noises and severe acoustic inaccuracies. As far as the noise canceling issue goes, I heard a conversation going on about six feet away while using these. Don't make my mistake; get something else."
2,You get what you pay for,"Have been scouring reviews on different budget headphones and earbuds. Decided to try the CX-300's due to mostly good reviews and price point. Sound is OK, a bit better but nothing extraordinary compared to the standard IPOD earbuds or my old Sony MDR-V200's. For the price ($21)they are fine."
4,pretty good,"i just got these earphones today and tested them out. They ""muffle"" most noises like people talking, cell phones etc. Don't expect absolute silence when you play your music. You CAN still hear things but they aren't as loud... just muffled. Small noises are absent. My only complaint it that if you hit the cord you will hear a thud in your earphones. If you dont move around alot its not noticeable. Fit is good and comfortable."
4,Pretty Smooth,"Noise cancellation is really top notch. I was looking for earbuds that were better than the run-of-the-mill ones you get as defaults or just buy really quickly in the store.Sometimes though, I can't hear the person next to me if I have one ear in. This is not terrible, but just saying.There is some ""noise conduction"" if you run or touch the wires. I'm not too bothered by this. It's a small price to pay.4 stars because I was expecting a little more on the high tones, and this is really just bass heavy. Otherwise, everything is great.I thought I read that amazon said it was a symmetric wire, it is not, which is even better.Oh yes, and now I can listen to music in a noisy area at the lowest setting possible...which is really amazing."
2,Won't stay in the ear,"I purchased the CX300, because it came with different size ear buds. However I found that none of the buds would keep the earphones in my ears even when sitting. I finally had to remove the buds entirely but then found that there was no base although the sound was good. I guess I have large ears would you think? They are inexpensive enough that I didn't send them back. If you have no problem with regular ear buds I feel sure that they would work for you."
2,Surprisingly... bad?,"These headphones have pretty solid reviews and they're Sennheiser, so they seemed like a sure thing. Unfortunately, they just don't sound good at all! I'm no audiophile but these headphones are about the same as or worse than my iPod buds. The sound is really a muddy, tinny mess most of the time and the bass is probably worse than my iPod set. Maybe I got a broken pair or something? Maybe my ears don't work? I tried these on my computer and iPod with no great results.Edit: if you set the EQ on your iPod to ""Small Speakers"" these sound OK"
5,"For the price, the best","This is my second pair, the other one is at my friend's possesion. Both are working well, excellent sound quality for everyday use with notebook, cell phone... Just couple of points.Make sure it is well placed in your ear to get maximum bass.Not very good for workouts, touching the wires makes funny sounds.No carrying case.The wire is the right size to have the player in your pocket near waistline.And, avoid listening at high levels, you will damage your hearing over time."
4,headphones were pretty good,"Not bad for the price, all though i'm not too fond of the longer chord for the right ear. I know your supposed to put it behind your neck, but I don't like that very much."
2,Loved them for 3 months till the cord quit working,"I couldn't be happier with the sound quality from these headphones, but that great sound quit working after 3 months. (I also had durability problems with my iPhone earbuds from Sennheiser.)Fits well: With the three sizes of ear pads, it is easy to fit them comfortably in my ears.Noise isolation: They do very well at blocking outside noise. I was actually at a postgame celebration for the Columbus Crew and was able to block out the outside noise and hear the audio at a comfortable level.FRAGILE: If it weren't for the terrible durability of the cord, I would highly recommend the Sennheiser collection of ear buds.Sorry, Sennheiser, you let a tiny wire ruin what could have been a near perfect product. Fail!"
1,Fine until they stop working,"I'm pretty careful with my headphones, and mostly use them when walking around the city. I have had 2 pairs stop working on one side since I bought the first in July 2009 (5 months ago). I won't be buying these again."
3,Great for the money. A giant step up from OEM.,"I rate these three stars on just about everything except value. They get 5 stars for value. A small amount of money gets you a giant leap above the dreck supplied by most MP3 player sellers.Unless you record at higher rates, you won't notice much difference if you spend more than these cost, anyway, so they are just right for a lot of people.If you record at 256k, consider spending a little more and buying NuForce.Watch our for counterfeit Sennheisers. These are so popular that there are poor counterfeits all over."
3,Good earbuds,"I'm not someone who knows a lot of terminology for the way music is projected. But I'll start by saying I bought these to replace the $20 VModa earbuds that cracked at the bottom of my purse. These have definitely lasted longer, and you can just feel that it's more durable when you put them on. The VModa earbuds, however, had much better sound/better bass/cleaner quality. These are really good too, definitely better than the buds that came with my Ipod. You can definitely hear the full range of sound and all the subtleties in the music. My only objection is that the bass doesn't really have a strong body, and there's still that cheap earbud static that trails some sounds. These are good for the price though, which is below $20, I wouldn't pay any more than that."
5,Well balanced sound,"I bought these after using JVC Marshmallows, Sony Bumpin Buds and several other earbuds. I listen to mostly classical and jazz and these are by far the best balanced sounding of all. They have great mids as well as extended highs and bass. I can recommend them highly to anyone seeking an upgrade in sound quality for their MP3 player."
3,Not THAT good!!,"With all the great reviews here, I thought I was getting a great set of earbuds, not so. Sure you can get alot of bass through them...if you shove them into your brain. I tried all 3 sizes of plugs and none of them allowed me to hear the bass. However, once the earbuds are fully inserted into yours ears and you press REALLY hard on them you can hear the bass. But tell me, who is going to hold their hands to their ears while listening to music. Nobody!The only thing I fould positive about these was that they did indeed block out outside sounds. When one considers the money spent on this versus the improvement of sound over the standard Ipod headphones it is a complete and total waste of money."
1,"""So called"" Sennheiser Earbuds","I'm sure if these were an authentic pair of Sennheiser earbuds, they would be great. What I received was a $5 knock off. Be careful who you purchase an item from. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The pair I received are junk. I tried to leave negative feedback for the merchant but removed it for editing and was unable to rewrite my feedback. I contacted Amazon about resetting the option for me to leave feedback for the merchant and haven't heard anything back. I also wrote the merchant an email and they didn't get back to me yet either. Junk."
2,Sound quality,"Compared to other in ear head phones I have tried I was very disappointed with these. I had bought some regular earphones from Senheiser and they were comfortable, efficient and had good bass.These in ear buds needed the MP3 player cranked up to maximum and the bass was lacking despite equalization compared to the give away ones you get with a Sansa MP3 player.I would not recommend these in ear buds and especially not at the price."
1,Counterfit,I have read other reviews for this item which warned against counterfits. This is one. A few months back I purchased the same item from a different vendor and based on how the first one performed for me I decided to purchase an inentical item for her. This earbud does not even come close to performing like the genuine sennheiser. It was not even packaged the same. One ear piece was longer than the other. The genuine sennheiser had a carry case and a device to wrap the cord around when the item was not in use. I would not ever recommend this item or this vendor.
4,"good, but watch out for 'line bumps'","I purchased these to make lawn mowing a little less painful. I needed some noise cancellation, but didn't want to spend the big bucks for active cancellation. They work fine for that.BUT, these ear-canal-type headphones transmit all manner of bumps to your line cord right up to your ears. When I'm not moving on my tractor, this isn't an issue, so I'm happy. But I don't think they would work well if you were using them and actively moving a lot, say during exercise. I suppose if I were more careful with the placement of the cord and my Ipod, this would go away. But I don't want to have to think about that, really.Of course, I don't think this has anything to do with this particular brand or model. I think it's just part of the ear-canal-headphone experience."
2,Skip Them.....,"The audio quality isn't great. I just bought a pair to replace my V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds that my dog recently destroyed. I would rather have the Freqs. If your looking for decent buds in this price range, skip these and head to the VMODAs .... trust me, you will be more satisfied."
5,"Great sound quality, Good Isolation, Bad comfort.",I am pretty happy with these despite a burning feeling when they're in my ear due to the friction from the rubber.Other than comfort I like the isolation (I can barely hear my TV when its on the highest volume).But the best part is sound quality its better than anything I have used.Basically SO FAR SO GOOD!!
1,Very poorly engineered--do not buy!,"This product is incredibly poorly designed. Like many, I use these earphones to listen to music while working out. The cord design is so poor that you hear incredibly loud and annoying sounds every time the cord brushes against you. I've never had this problem with other earphones, and it's so annoying that I'd be much better off listening to the much cheaper earphones that came with my MP3. I really regret wasting my $ on this product and strongly advise against buying it. I can't believe Sennheiser engineering is this bad!"
4,Real ones are great but I just received fakes from Amazon...,"I have bought several pairs of these headphones from amazon as I lose mine and I love them. Great sound and comfort and the rubberized finish keeps them from tangling too badly but buyer beware you may get fakes. I just got a pair and was almost fooled but the plating on the jack was gold and they just didn't feel right. I was on the fence until I played some music on them...wow what a difference....the fakes sound terrible and tinny...So great headphones if you get the real ones...FYI my fakes came from ""Your Best Deal Inc."""
3,Great Sound but Quality is TERRIBLE,I got these with high expectations and they were automatically filled. But after about half a year barely any sound comes out of the right ear and when I put them in my ear it makes this weird popping noise. I wouldnt recommend these.
1,even the best manufacturers have duds,"This is an altogether inferior product. The length differential in right and left ear bud feeds is silly and arbitrary. The buds do not fit well into the ear, no matter what size I use, and the sound quality is almost as good as competing products. After two months of light use, the left channel died. A week later the right channel died. Junk. Avoid. Fortunately, seller is taking back the junk for refund."
3,Good but Fragile,"On my second pair now after having my first for about 3 years.My first pair lasted about 3 years, up until the right ear piece started going bad, and eventually died.At first I thought it was natural wear and tear, especially considering I had used them on a daily basisfor such a long time.I bought my second pair back in May 2011, and have been using them on a daily basis up until now.Yesterday, the right earpiece started going bad, and today it completely stopped working.I do plug-in and unplug these very often as I use them with my iphone and only use them at work and school,so I do believe I use them more than the average person.But to only last half a year is unacceptable.I'm almost certain that it's a problem with the cabling near the headphone jack as the sound in the rightearpiece goes in and out as I turn or bend the jack.While the sound is great, it's just way too fragile to warrant daily use."
2,"Purchased in May, broken by December","This morning the right side just stopped working. Very disappointing, as I have only had these since May. I just use them on my commute to and from work, so not really putting them through much. Since they were sold by The Audio Max (fulfilled by Amazon) they are not eligible for warranty. Possibly could have been fakes. Before they broke though they were perfect, sounded great. Oh well."
1,dissatisfied,"the right earbud stopped working after 3 months, for no reason as far as I can tell. I didn't damage the earbuds in any way."
3,"Good sound quality, poor durability","This is my second pair of Sennheiser CX300-B's. The sound quality on these is really great for the price. I had my first pair for about 10 months and got great use out of them until the right earbud stopped working. I could get the audio to come out of the right bud when I pinched the cord in just the right place, but it was clearly damaged. I got my second pair 4 months ago and they were great until this afternoon when the right bud on this pair crapped out. I didn't put them through any particularly rigorous abuse. I kept them neatly wrapped in my pocket and used them just about daily. Both pairs that I've had broke in the exact same spot (about an inch from the input jack), which seems like an odd place for a break to occur.Needless to say, I'm going to step up to a higher end model now hoping for some additional durability."
3,Just Okay,"I bought these and a pair of Etymotic Research MC5 to compare. The later was $40 more, but well worth it. These just feel cheap and the cord is too short to keep the player in my shorts pocket. The earbuds don't stay in that well regardless of which size I use. They do have better bass than the MC5, but the noise cancelling is weak. All in all, they do the job for realatively cheap, but I would not buy again."
1,Not what I expected.,"This is my 3rd pair of headphones from Sennheiser. The other 2 have been perfect. The sound quality is fantastic and they have held up wonderfully. One pair is a ""waterproof"" running set, that I run with 4 times a week and always rinse off after I'm finished, and I haven't had a single issue with them. These on the other hand have developed static after just 5 uses. I'm so disappointed. I haven't heard a single ounce of static from my other headphones, but these have started to crackle badly if the volume is anything above the minimum. It sounds like a blown speaker. I'm worried I received a knock off brand set or something, as Sennheiser product should never act like these have."
1,These are the worst.,"Yeah, these broke after two months. Which is one month past the Amazon return window. The sound started going out in one ear, and I had to do that thing where you gently jiggle the cord and hold it just so, in order to find *just* the right position for stereo sound to work. In protest, both sides stopped working. Huzzah! I would certainly not buy these again."
4,Good sound for the price,"I like the sound of these ear phones.Good bass.I don't like the two long (right) and short (left) cords. Woundn't have bought if I new this before.Getting use to it.The ear phones also seam to stay in my ears better(if you don't snag them),than others I have tried,and they block out the noise.Plus the ear phone are small.I have sure ear phones,and I like these better because of this.I can ware these longer without them hurting my ears.I sometimes go to sleep with them on.Like all ear phones you have to set your MP3 to the right sound setting to get the best sound.So I give 4 stars,because of the cord issue.It all comes down to how they sound A+.Hope this review helps."
5,Love them!,"These earphones are great - I much prefer them over my Sony noise cancelling headphones as they produce better quality sound. For those whinging about the longer length cord on the right side - they are designed to go around the back of your neck! hench why one side is longer. I jog, walk and sit at work with them on and have had no problem with the earphone cord coming out."
2,Latest Model is Pathetic,"New Buyer Beware!I purchased the CX-300 B back in August 2007, and was absolutely thrilled with the performance. The right earpiece stopped working properly almost exactly 1 year later. The price on these was just right, so I bought a new set.What a disappointment.In A-B comparison, my left ear only model produced much better bass, and much more natural mid-range.The new model is overly bright in the mid-range, and the bass has virtually disappeared. Looking at the earbuds, the new model is a matte black, and the screen protecting the driver is a much larger ""grid pattern"".The old model has a glossy finish, a finer grid pattern, and inserts more fully in the ear.Now I need to try and find a place to repair my old ones. The new CX-300 is an extreme disappointment."
2,"Bright sound, not very durable","These are very bright, meaning there's a lot of high end compared to the midrange or bass. Not a lot of detail in the high end either. I am an audiophile.Bought these for my teen-age son. They lasted only a few months."
3,"Good, except for one major flaw","I ordered these a few weeks ago to use while working out. I use the smallest ear peice and it fits great. They sound good, providing a nice level of sound isolation, which is nice in a noisy gym. My one complaint, which is me being picky is that the legnth of cord going to your ears are not of equal length. You cant tell this from the picture. One side is shorter that the other. I never really understood why manufacturers did this. Anyway, I am not on the hunt for a different pair. I wish I could look past it, but I cant.If that doesnt bother you, then go for it. Cant find anything close at best buy for $20."
2,"Good sound quality, very poor fit","The sound quality is very good, but it is impossible to walk or even move your head without getting at least one of the headphones out of place. The cable is short too.If they could fit better definitely they will be the best option. I didn't wanted to spend more than $30 without sacrificing sound quality and that is exactly what I got, but you can't go through a whole song without getting them put of place."
1,These are just bad.,"There isn't much to say other than that these are horrible headphones. There is nothing good about them. The sound is horrible, they are uncomfortable and really shouldn't even be allowed to be sold. Typical german enginereed garbage. Style without substance. BMW, Audi and Senheiser all belong to this exclusive club."
2,Not worth it!!!,Nothing about these headphones works for me. The sound quality is lack luster. The earplugs all fall out of my ears and I tried all three sizes. If you want high quality sound and ear confort cough up the $100 and buy the Bose Headphones.
3,Decent cheap earbuds,"These are good cheap earbuds that come with 3 different sizes of earpieces. They stay in my ears pretty well and they do a decent job of blocking out outside noise. The sound quality is less than great but isn't horrible...maybe they need more breaking in. I am 6'2"" and if my player is in my pocket, the cord is short enough to tug at my ears. Should be ok for most people but I wish the sound was better and the cord was a bit longer. Decent value for the price (I paid $23.48)."
2,Sennheiser fan disappointed,"I've always been in love with sennheiser, until this. Great bass sound, but terrible tremble and midrange qualities. Absolute dirt."
3,"Great sound, but a little too fragile","These headphones have a great sound to them and were working out really well for a couple of months. About a week ago, without one major problem (yanking them out, snagging them on something, etc.) the left ear bud began fade in and out. Now, I am having problems anytime I wear them while my mp3 player is moving around. This is a problem for me because I walk to work and generally listen to music both ways. I have no problem with them when I am at work with the mp3 player is stationary (although I do occasionally need t adjust the wire), but they really just aren't the right headphones for me. I do like sennheiser products and definitely would buy them in the future, but this particular set of headphones just wasn't for me. If you plan to use these for a computer or while you are at work these are great headphones for the price. If you need them for exercising or basically anything active I would go with a different model."
4,Gets the job done,"Sound quality satisfies me. Only negative is the style is prone to popping out of the ears easily, even if your hand, inadvertently, swipes the dangling cords. That's not specific to this model, but to all earbud style headphones."
4,very good for the price,"I purchased these headphones through a sale here on Amazon.com. The sound quality is very good and they fit comfortably in my ears. I typically avoid in-ear headphones, but I haven't been able to find a good pair of headphones that rest just out side the ear. The offset length of cord from earbud to earbud may be a plus to some, or an annoyance to others. If you are looking for a good priced in ear headset, I definately recommend these."
3,"Better than xyz, but not great","I got a pair on sale, $10 after rebate when I read a thread at one of my favorite forums. However, even at $10 for me it's a waste of money. Reason is they don't begin to compare with the Etymotic ER4S earbuds I already have except that they are more sensitive. They are a lot better than what came with my devices, but even so I'll never use them. I plan to buy some Etymotic ER4P's, which are more sensitive than the ER4S's. The Etymotic are way more expensive than the Sennheisers but totally worth spending the extra money even for a guy on my budget!"
1,no thanks,"Product was way below my expectations. If I move my earphones around while listening to music, I start to lose sound. Overall the earphones is not so great. Not to mention I received the product a month after I ordered it without any response from the seller."
2,"Good Sound, Horrible Cable","I'm no audiophile, but here's my opinion...Pros:Bass2-year warrantyWarm soundSound-isolationCons:Price (probably b/c of the cons listed below)Assymetrical cable/J cord (it's annoying to wear and looks weird)Microphonics (I can always hear myself breath and the cord hitting against my body)"
3,Poor Durability; One Earbud Failed,"This product produced great sound and low cost only about $16.00 back in Sept 2009; however the earbud with the short lead failed to work after six month. I used it as my primary head phone set even though I have more expensive sets. I gave it 3 stars because I was very happy with it while it worked so much that I'm going to order another one hoping that it may have gotten damage when I was exercising. I'm going to try the Sennheiser CX300 Earbuds this time instead of the CX300-B basically because of the lower cost. Another reviewer stated that the ""B"" stands for black."
4,Excellent product with quirks,"Excellent product for podcasts--in bus, light rail, car, it's possible to hear podcast without blasting the volume. Very comfortable to use--much more comfortable than Apple's earbuds. Oddly imbalanced in length: 33"" plug to split; split to left earbud 12""; split to right earbud 20"". The idea is that you carry your player on your left side and run the longer right cord around the back of your neck. Has a tendency to pop out of ear when cord catches on something because of different lengths. Right wire failed after 9 months, then the left shortly afterwards (both at the plug), but I'll try to replace it under warranty or buy a new one. Very happy with it."
1,Don't Buy,These headphones have to be worn behind the head because the cords for each ear are different length. Also they don't fit in the ear comfortably with any of the different size ear adapters. Cheap feeling pieces of junk!
5,Very nice upgrade from the iphone ones,Clear sound and isolates outside noise to the best of its ability. Seller was very quick in shipping this out. Overall very pleased
4,Light and powerful,"I bought these as a replacement for my Shure E2C earbuds. While not quite as clear and precise, these earbuds have powerful bass and are much lighter than my Shures. For the price, these sound great and I would recommend them to anyone with an ear for quality."
3,"Sound is a bright, otherwise a good value.","Bought these for my son. They seem to be a good value. Haven't compared them to their competition. This review is based upon a short listening evaluation by an audiophile.Sound is bright, as in too much high end, with a full upper bass. This gets worse as you turn the volume up. My personal preference is for a ""flat"" sound with tight bass and detailed high end. The good news is you don't have to crank the volume too loud to get some detail in the high end. Overall, they are listenable headphones, especially at medium volume levels, if you don't mind the brightness. I couldn't find an equalizer preset on my Ipod that make these sound great.The three sizes of ear cushions really help get the bass right, since the bass is dependent on a good seal with your ear."
3,What kind of ears do you have?,"Sound reproduction is high quality, but I've not been able to get a satisfactory ""in-ear"" fit from these earbuds. The different size pads do not help. As a result, higher volume is required, and some MP3 players cannot drive the earbuds at sufficient volume. I think the fit problem is simply that these earbuds are too short to seat properly in typical human ears."
1,Overpriced...sound quality is not the best,I am not happy with this product. It doesn't sound very well. The cord is not long. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Do not waste your money,This is a poor quality product* Earbuds covers are flimsy and do not stay on earbuds securely* Unremarkable sound quality* Input jack has poor connection and makes a scratchy sound when moved* Not comfortable
1,:/ this ear phone is aight!,Cord length is a joke and the style of the headphones is like the phone ones. As in one cord is shorter than the other. I would NOT recommend these headphones
1,Worst Earphones to buy,"These headphones almost give me headaches as the completely block the ear canal, but thats of no use to block noise due to poor quality plugs, plus the sound is as if there is no bass in this world.Too much treble is deifnately bad for ur ears and head. I never expected this kind of product from senheisser knowing its reputation in the market, this product is highly just not what it says to deliver I suppose all these positive comments on this product are by themself.its better to stick to apple standard earphones than buying this. The wire is thin, the plastic is cheap, quality is poor, even the mesh kind of thing between also came off in few days and trust me i do not manhandle my stuff, i am still carrying my apple earphones since last 2 and half year and they are still in use as these headphones are of no use to me."
5,Stopped using my noise-canceling headphones,"These are the most comfortable and best-sounding earbuds I have ever owned. (Not that I have bought anything special in the past.) They are almost comfortable enough to sleep in, and the sound is a noticeable improvement over other earbuds. At the health club I notice that I can use a lower volume setting on my MP3 player because the earbuds shut out the noise. Best of all, when I go on bus trips with my ski club I have stopped using my noise-canceling headphones because I can hear just as well with these earbuds. I listen mostly to classical music, so I need the sound isolation to hear the quieter parts in a noisy environment."
3,Decent sound but too much cord noise,"The sound is decent enough for this range of earphones and they do a good job of noise isolation; however, they have their share of issues too. In order to get the proper sound and isolation, you need to put them all the way into your ear. Unfortunately, this causes every movement of the cord to carry into your ears as well. While I understand the asymmetrical or L-shaped cord is meant to have its advantages, I guess I'm a creature of habit and still can't get used to it. At first I even thought it was a manufacturing defect, until I read about it online. I've had these for several months and I'm still more comfortable with the cords leading to the ears being the same length. In the end, the sound is better than the standard iPod earphones and the noise isolation is nice, but the cord noise and asymmetrical design is just too bothersome for me."
4,Love them !,"In-ear bud are the only type that will work for me, and these work great, stay in place, and are comfortable.Sound quality for the price is good too."
4,"Not world class, but well worth the price around $20","Although the asymmetrical is a bit strange, these headphones deliver reasonable sound overall. The sound is not completely neutral and these phones warm and increase bass response compared to the way the music was recorded. Noise isolation is decent.psychic medium, alien encounters, government conspiracy"
2,these are overrated,"I bought these awhile ago because of the great discount on amazon ($35 less than list), and because of the great reviews. these buds sound *pretty* good, but i would have returned them if i had paid anymore for them. it is good sound for a price range around $20. the low and mid ranges are a bit ""muddy"", but clear enough to be listenable. the worst part about these is how easily they fall out of my ears, and how difficult it is to adjust them in precisely the right position to get any decent tone. that alone to me makes them not worth paying more than $20. for the price you can get better sound and better fit. just to note, the asymmetrical cables are really annoying. the short side is too short, and the long side is slightly too long. but, like i said, these things sound pretty decent."
4,One of the better Vampire Romance Books,"I have always been fascinated with Vampire stories and have quite a collection. I actually wrote a term paper (many years ago) entitled ""Vampiric Trends in Modern Fiction"". That aside, let me tell you that this is one of the best Vampire books in the romantic genre that I have come across. The book is well paced, the theme sophisticated by romance standards, and of course it is very hot. As to how to weigh my praise against your taste, I'll add, I love Susan Krinard, but loath Amanda Ashely."
4,A refreshing new angle,"I hate to sound repetative, but I am in complete agreement with the others who have reviewed this book. I have always had a love/hate relationship with the idea of vampire romances. Somehow, the idea of vampires is in itself not a very romantic notion...in most cases a living dead person. Yuk!! Ms. Creswell shines a different light on this topic and makes one want to read even more. She also throws in a story and a time period which is very seldom written about. Kudos, and I am looking forward to reading more stories by Ms. Creswell."
4,great finished look added to the tail pipe,Looks great on my Mazda3. It took me only 5 minutes using a socket wench to install.The chrome tail pipe makes the car look a lot more finished.
3,"Won't really fit a 2.25"" pipe.","Looks great and looks to be good quality. However, the clamps included will NOT fit a 2.25 inch pipe. I managed to get one clamp barely on and used the included bolts (took other two clamps off. They would not fit) and screwed them into the holes by themselves. It works but if you look too close, it looks kinda funny. But no one will ever look that close. It looks great on my 01 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT. Added a nice look to the back. So, 3 stars. 5 for the look, minus two for the fit."
2,Be careful,"Decent quality. The demensions info is incorrect. It does not fit my truck. Seller needs to have very accurate 'inlet diameter' demensions stated. It did have a 2 3/4"" inlet. Very disappointed. I give it two stars for quality."
2,"Not So Superior, Rusted After 1 Week","This tip looked nice when I received it and after being installed. However, after only 1 week of use it began to show signs of rust. I cleaned it the best I could but could not remove the rust. I'm glad I bought this tip only as a temporary solution before installing a dual tip."
2,size problem,"the part is ok, but my car exhaust tip < 2.5"" (about 2.2x), but it doesnt fit. be careful about this. its max only up to 5.3cm. now i dont want any bigger size. but i have to find a way to put it on, any suggestion?"
2,I liked BRAINS! better,"I purchased this video and ""BRAINS! Harnessing the Power of Emotional Intelligence"" at the same time. I'm going to return this one because my groups liked the BRAINS! video much better. BRAINS! was more money, but worth it because it really engaged people as they learned about emotional intelligence. It also uses examples they recognize and can identify with. You also get a DVD and VHS which I suppose helps defray the cost."
5,"3 in 1: My Big Truck, Train, Rescue","This is a great book. It has all kinds of trucks, trains and rescue vehicles. My grandchildren love looking at it. The pictures are great and it keeps them interested for a long time."
1,Yuck!,"My book club tried to read this book and no one was able to finish it! In an attempt to write what one woman in the group called ""high literature"" the author failed to connect and draw you in to the story. I only made it through the first 100 pages and gave up because it was just too hard to follow. Save your money and buy another book. Might I recommend ""The Last Integrationist"" by Jake Lamar or any book by Octavia Butler."
5,Sci Fi that's believable,"From the moment I started reading I couldn't put this book down. I know that's a cliche but with this book it was true. The characters really leap out of the pages as 'real' people.The main character, Shan Frankland, is one of those rare human beings, someone with integrity. Throughout the book she is struggling to keep her charges alive despite their best efforts. The whole environmentalist theme of the book really appealed to me. And Karen's view of the future, one of human society being run by large corporations, while at once sinister is also very believable. And the vision of humans rapaciously spreading to other worlds is all too familiar to human history so far.If you like your science fiction with a lot of realism, with a hard edge and without too much techno-babble getting in the way of a strong story, then this book is for you. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.Ripping yarn!"
3,Just too many coincidences for my taste,"Toward the end of the book, a character says the following line:""Shan Frankland has not changed at all.""A very true statement. Shan doesn't change much at all during the course of the book. Not bad in itself, but when the character seems to be tailor made for what the plot has in store for her, it ends up to be pretty boring. Once the lay of the land was established, I knew how things were likely to go down and it pretty much followed what I thought would happen.It also doesn't help that a certain event happens that is conveniently inconvenient for the characters. Time it too early or too late, and it is a very different story. It isn't a bad book, but it is ultimately not very compelling."
5,Very Nice,"Ok, it's simple if you like Code Lyoko or if your child likes Code Lyoko, get him this action figure. The detail is nice, and the quality is up there. It is a chunky blok, because well...that's what it is. It has a nice launching feature which adds to the realism in this toy. I do like this a lot. Buy it if you like Code Lyoko, it's just nice to have a little piece of Lyoko with you."
2,It is very fragile,"My son, who takes good care of his toys, was playing with this toy and after only 2 days the legs on the bottom broke off. He loves Code Lyoko, but the toys are of very poor quality."
3,"Overall, the book is beautifully illustrated","I was attracted to the book by it's cover, showing children of all ethnic groups. I said, WOW. This will be great for my Sunday School class. I was pleased with the opening story of how we are all the same on the inside and THEN, for the next 170 pages, with a few minute exceptions, there are nothing but Caucasion children. I left the book in the store."
4,"Dark, but uplifting! One of Depeche Mode's best!","If you are not a big DM fan, this album is not for you. I have followed Depeche since thier first album and this one is the best proof that their music has survived the genre that has past. Songs here are dark and moody but teneciously uplifting, David Gahan did sang his best vocal so far and Martin Gore's songwriting craftsmanship is truly, madly and deeply!"
3,Not excellent,"The album is very good, but it is not the best in depeche's carrier, It is amaziang how the Songs of Faith and Devotion live is better than this one. But songs like In Your Room, I Feel You are worth the album, plus the track # 8 Rush, one of the best depeche songs ever..."
3,intersesting but unfocused a lot of the time,"Many of the questions were well thought out. Many of the responses were wonderful and gratifying. But the producers allowed anyone to jump in at any time, and a couple of them did, drowning out the others' responses frequently. You barely get to hear Nina Dobrev at all."
5,Proven success,"After reading ""A Guide - Workplace Success: Ten Steps to Career Advancement, I smiled because I am a by-product of exercising all of the strategies, suggestions, and advice illustated in the book. Dr. Lenora Peters Gant was my mentor at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) dating back to 1991. She has help to groom me professionally. She has been a key to my career success. Today, I am a Branch Chief and I have already purchased copies of this book for members of my team, my new mentor and friends. Dr. Gant is also a proven success. She has reached the Senior Executive Service (SES) ranks at the Community Management Staff (CMS). Thanks for a fine tool..."
1,Pretty expensive per slice,"I bought this knife when it was significantly more expensive than the current price. I used it about six times before the battery failed. Moreover, I had to remove the plastic piece that made it necessary to keep pressure on the switch to keep the knife running,so I could use my full hand to slice. Finally, it didn't have enough juice to do a whole 10-pound ham. Almost, but not quite.After it failed, I tossed it into the trash and estimated my cost for its ""convenience"". About 10 cents per slice.BTW, I don't see much better in reviews of other brands of cordless knives. I'm back to corded again"
1,battery,"We bought the Sonic Blade 7865.00 knif about 2 moth ago. We are not able to use the knif, unless we charge over night befor we use it will not keep a charge."
1,Emerson/sonic should be dropped by Amazon,"Emerson, the parent company is as bad as the Sonic junk. The battery died and no one knows where to get one. Poor design. I called, email Emerson ten days ago. Amazon won't do anything either since it is past 90 days. So I am trashing this tonight."
1,GIFTS THAT DISAPPOINT,"Leaving the original's battery on the charger fried it - or so I thought. I purchased the 2nd for my wife's Christmas(and a 3rd as a Christmas gift for daughter to take advantage of free shipping) in the hopes that we would do better with the recharghing. Following the instructions - charge at least 10 hours before 1st use - the battery is simply not strong enough for the motor. The new knife is no different than the old one - the blades move slowly and once in the turkey or roast, totally bog down. (Then you saw with the blades as if using a regular knife). It turned out that the ""old"" battery is just fine. My advice would be that if you don't already have this unit, find another brand or manufacturer. Now I have 2 of everything and they're basically useless. If there was any ""return within so many days for a full refund, I would take it. Better yet, if you're still determined to have this unit, I'll sell you one for half price and throw in the second for free."
1,huge disappointment,"So i did what i was supposed to. Charged it overnight and was ready to try. It just flat out doesnt do what it is supposed to and it surely is not as advertised. The blades barely move back and forth for a few pulls of the trigger then it gets even slower and more pathetic. It doesn't cut any meat at all, not even a very tender brisket. This is one of the usual ""as seen on tv"" that just dont work. I would reccomend ANY ELECTRICAL KNIFE over this peice of junk. I hoped that the blades would fit my old corded electrical knife but not even that. I will say that the blades are very sharp, but big deal, they dont move hardly at all.TERRIBLE PRODUCT, I wouldn't want one for free."
2,Disposable Knife,"I took the title for my review from another reviewer's comments because I believe it to be so appropriate for this knife. I have been using one of these knives for 3 or 4 years now. I have no problem with the quality of the knife itself, but the battery is another matter. I am still using the original knife, but have purchased a pair of complete extra knives just to get the batteries. (I got them for about $24 each including shipping.) One of them is now failing. I have spent hours researching how to purchase just the battery and have found none. I have also spent hours shopping for an alternative CORDLESS knife and found none."
4,Cordless Electric Knife,"The Sonic Blade cordless electric knife is heavier than my regular electric knife so it took a bit to get comfortable maneuvering it relative to the turkey when cutting off the drumstick and thigh. With a regular roast there were no awkwardness. It had excellent power and overall, not having to be close to an outlet is a definite advantage. I would recommend this product!"
1,Dissatisfaction with seller,"I purchased 5 of these knives, and one of them was an obvious damaged ,inoperative return from a walgreens store..( tagged return from Walgreens) I sent it back 3 weeks ago, according to their instructions. NO RESPONSE!!I am going to contact my credit card company and cancel the payment.J Keller"
1,"very very bad product, just like the company who has gone bankrup","I bought this product, and the whole family complained about it ever since!As many of you have known, handle is hard to grab, battery is so weak makes the knife hard to cut even if on chicken, each time we have to press the blade hard to do the cutting. And each time we have to remeber to recharge the battery, all pain!I suggest to use a corded power knife, will be powerful, and hope with a good grip, not like this one has."
1,Great Knife Until the Battery Dies and You Can't Get a Replacement,"I have 2 of these knives and they worked great for a year and then the batteries would not hold a charge. I tried calling and e-mailing the Sonic Blade company and they never responded. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. You will wind up throwing the it away when the battery dies. I don't even know if they manufacture this anymore so while you may be buying a new product, it could have been produced years ago and that could minimize the battery life. Too bad because when it worked, there was nothing as great. Oh well. Live and learn from the horrors of infomercials."
4,sonic knife,"As far as electric knife's go, this is a great one. Easy to keep the battery charged, and a great knife to use."
4,sonic blade,"i have had a sonic blade before but the battery would not stop in the housing so i purchased another.i paid my 52 83 and thought that would be all, but when i went to collect it from royal mail i had to pay another 12 to retrieve it.when i questioned this i was told i should know the rules for imported goods.(how many do).the next thing was the plug which was sent with the knife. it is an american plug and willnot fit british socketsso how does one recharge the thing?.i rate the blade but not the service."
2,Follow-up Review,"Owned two sonics before that I bought in a store. First one was great. Second one, battery gave out. This time I bought it on line and the first three uses were fine then battery gave out. Tried to reach someone by phone, but they did not return any of my calls as yet. Very disappointed! Went back to electric knife."
2,Sonic Blade 7865.00 Cordless Rechargeable Knife,"The first time we recharged the battery it did not take a charge,after 36 hours.Now it does not hold power very long,after 8 or 10 consecutive cuts it seems weak.The lock on the trigger to turn knife on is a poor design because it interferes with the operational use,constantly getting turned off.The holding stand is a clumsy arrangement,not user friendly.I would gladly pay more money for a better designed wall mounted rechargeable knife!"
3,Battery powered knife,"This is a great idea for an electric knife. There is no cord to get in the way and the battery is easy to put in and take out. The on/off switch is tricky and hard to line up. Maybe it's just this knife, but it's been hard to get the knife started and then keep it cutting through meat. I have to move it several times before I can keep it running, or just keep it on constantly until I'm done. The on/off and safety switches have to be just right to make it work."
1,Battery Life,"I purchased a sonic blade a year ago, basically to cut my home made bread whilst it is still warm. The idea is great but I have just put mine in the bin. After charging the battery overnight there was stil only enough power to slice less than half of a 500g loaf. I then changed to a second battery that I charged yesterday and was still not able to finish the job. I purchased the second battery early on as I could not slice a whole loaf with one and it was impossible to carve a complete roast joint.I will now purchase a corded electric knife which will be ready any time I want it, be reliable and be much cheaperThis product is a pile of rubbish, bits of plastic break off, the battery life is poor and takes an age to recharge and it should be withdrawn pending redesign of what is basically a good idea."
3,cordless rechargeable knife,I purchased this as a Christmas gift. The recipient just happened to purchase the same product for another family member and was coveting the knife. He was really excited that he got one of his own. Haven't heard any complaints so I assume he is very satisfied with the product.
1,THE LONGER YOU HAVE IT THE WORSE IT GETS!!,"BOUGHT THE FIRST ONE [PART OF A 2 FOR $99.00 DEAL]ON 03/01/07 IT WAS USED ABOUT 10 TIMES A YEAR WITH GREAT RESULTS!! HOWEVER AS TIMES WENT ON THE KNIFE STARTED TO LOSE POWER. AFTER THAT, THE KNIFE WOULD NOT CUT BUTTER. I CONTACTED SONIC BLADE BUT NO RESPONSE AFTER 6 EMAILS, AND NO ACTION WITH THE 5 PHONE CALLS. THE OTHER SONIC BLADE WAS GIVEN TO A FRIEND AND WAS THROWN AWAY WITHIN A YEAR DUE TO NO BATTERY LIFE. BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE IN 01/01/09 THIS ONE WAS WORSE AS OF THIS LETTER 01/30/10 IT IS DEAD!! WHEN IT WORKED IT WAS GREAT,HOWEVER IT NOW IS WORTHLESS. I EMAILED SONIC BLADE LAST WEEK ABOUT BOTH UNITS, GUESS WHAT?? NO RESPONSE!! I EVEN HAVE HELD ONTO BOTH UNITS IN CASE OF A RETURN DEAL,BUT I THINK I WAS TAKEN AGAIN. SAVE YOUR MONEY UNTIL A RELIABLE CORDLESS KNIFE COMES OUT. AFTER SOME RESEARCH ONLINE THERE ARE NO CORDLESS KNIVES OF VALUE. IF YOU ARE A INVENTOR THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PRODUCT TO START WITH!!"
2,Battery life sucks but it does cut well....,"I hope this review will be helpful - contrary to several other reviews, the knife does actually cut very well. As I write this review, my husband is cutting thin slices of frozen beef off of a 3lb chunk of meat. However, the battery life is terrible. Even if you leave it in the charger right up until you use it, it always dies after about 5 mins of use. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he says it would be fine if it was corded. Go w/ a corded knife to eliminate power issues."
1,Piece of Junk,"This product is a piece of junk. The knife is weak and the battery will not even stay up one day. I wish I had my money back, but I don't want to go to the hassel of sending it back."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is by far the worst piece of junk ever made. After I let the battery charge I went to cut some cheese and it was like the battery was dead, it would NOT cut through the cheese so I let it charge again before trying again, same results. I bought this to cut turkey and it did ok(barely)cutting the turkey so I'm not going to go through the bother of trying to return it. There were no reviews when I purchased it, so I took a chance and now I am very very disappointed."
2,Do not buy....does NOT hold a charge,This is the second sonic blade I had in one year. I received it for Christmas 2010 and it worked for a short time. I tried using it again later in 2010 and it did not work. Could not muster enough energy to slice even once slice of turkey. I just purchaed this again from Amazon thinking the first one was maybe defective. This one does not hold a charge either. I am in the process of contacting Amazon about returning this. Beware..........this is not a good knife.
1,very bad purchase,I purchase the sonic rechargeable knife but I have gotten very little to no use out of it. The battery is life time warranted but I called today and the company said they don't make the knife anymore so therefore they will not replace it. I rate this knife a zero!!!
1,Company went out of business,"The company (800 970 1869) went out of business, there is no more support for this knife. Replacement batteries can't be found, our knife is now worthless. DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Ripoff,This product is a rip off - the battery doesn't charge and they dont sell a replacement. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,"Very,very disappointing.Garbage",Disappointing. The battery life is minimal.And no replacements available.Scandal!!!! Garbage. Would advise not to buy this item to any.
1,WARNING: NO LONGER MADE!,"I bought this for Thanksgiving. I followed all the instructions to the letter. My husband went to cut the turkey and it barely turned on. The blades didn't have enough power to cut through the meat. He had to switch to a regular carving knife. I figured that I should try to recharge it again, just to give it another chance. It actually worked for all of 1 minute. I called the manufacturer to see about getting a new battery pack or charger. The customer rep very politely informed me that THEY STOPPED MAKING THIS 2 OR 3 YEARS AGO. She was really sorry and let me know that the WARRANTY IS NO GOOD. It expired when they stopped making it. Apparently the product had TOO MANY COMPLAINTS. Shame on you Amazon for continuing to sell this item."
1,faulty product sonic blade,"Upon receiving the aforementioned, I followed the instructions and charged it for the recommended 10 hours before first use. The charge light LED turned red and everything looked ok.Subsequently I inserted the battery pack. Dead. I waited a few days and charged it again for an additional 2 hours. Still nothing. I checked the pins on the knife base and pried them slightly thinking that perhaps the contacts were bad. Still nothing. I want to exchange the product.What am I to do?"
2,SONIC BLADE,"The BLACK KNOBS on blades fall off. Any suggestions, is there a guarantee I only purcahsed it a few months ago?"
1,Awful!,Tried to talk to someone at the company and they said this an outdated product ...way back. No replacement on the battery!!!! NICE!!!! I threw it out!!
1,Lousy Knife,Battery failed shortly AFTER using it for a few times. No replacements available. Put it in the garbage. Would advise not to buy this item.
1,Sonic Knife,"This is my second knife. My first was great until the switch got a short in it and couldnt be fixed. It had alot of power , didnt have to charge it veryt often. Used it all the time.So I ordered a new one, because we liked it so much. This one wont even stay charged long enough to slice a loaf of bread, and doest have near the power the other one did. It almost seems like it has been used instead of being a new one."
2,SONIC BLADE,"I have owned one for 2 yrs, loved it. The new one isn't any good because the battery won't stay charged long enough to cut up a roast or even bread. Is there any way to get a replacement battery. HELP"
1,Cordless Knife,"Disappointing. The battery life is minimal, it is very clumsy to handle. I will throw it in the garbage."
1,The worst product I have purchased,Sonic Blade Electric Cordless Knife As Seen on Tv This is worst product I have purchased.Even if the blade worked (it doesn't) it would be awkward and difficult to use - near impossible if you have arthritis in your hands. But the product doesn't do what it claims. Cutting frozen meat is a fantasy - when it was new it was difficult to even cut fresh meat. About the only thing it was good for was cutting fresh bread. After a couple of months it doesn't even do that. The knife does not recharge no matter how long you leave it in the charger. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product
3,"Product 3 stars, customer service 5 stars","I have had my Sonic knife for a year or so, and when I needed it, it was there to do what I wanted. However, the red switch would not stay ""on"". The plastic holders fell off my rounded blade, and when I called customer service they immediately replaced it no charge. Months later the plastic holder fell off my sharp blade, called customer service and they not only replaced it, but to my complaint about the red button not holding in place, they sent me a new unit. Again, no charge. Can't complain about that.."
1,Not good...,"I just threw my Sonic Blade along with all the accessories that came with it in the garbage, as that's where it belongs.I have learned my lesson about buying applicances directly from the manufacturor selling them on TV. And even if I did see this Knife for sale at some major dept store, I'd write Corporate to warn them about it."
1,Of no use,"After receiving the sonic blade knife I charged the battery for over 15 hours. When I tried to use the knife the battery went dead in less than two minutes. I recharged for 24 hours with the same result. Contacted Bazingaroo.com and they did email me a shipping label for returning it. After about a week and a half I received an email from their customer support stating they did not have a replacement to send me and recredited my card. I am dissapointed but at least not out any money. I would also mention that the item was listed as ""used"" so one would expect that it would not perform like new ""but""."
1,Cordless rechargeable knife,"Really wasn't satisfied with this knife, the first time i tried to use it the battery died and had to go back to old method, don't usually give a bad review on things I purchase, but feel people should know what they are purchasing. Others may be perfectly happy with this knife, I'm just saying it wasn't for me."
3,could be better,This works great as far as an electric knife goes. It cuts very well everything I have cut with it has been done with ease. The biggest problem with it is the battery life. The battery pack for this says long life but that is farthest from the truth. It sucks it dies very fast so think ahead if it's something that might take more then a couple min to cut up.
1,Poor Excuse for a Knife!!,"Bought one & really liked it..for a while. Battery wouldn't stay in the charger and product support is nonexistent. Fast forward a couple of years. Bought another one hoping that it would work better. Nope!! Started off after first charge well. After about a month, the blades move in slow motion no matter how long the battery is charged. No, my blades are not binding and are properly lubed... I am an idiot for buying another one of these $50 paperweights!!"
3,Sonic Blade,"I bought this product a while back when you got 2 for the price of $99 plus the slicing attachment etc. the knife worked great slicing turkeys and roasts. not so great on frozen stuff. The battery does not hold a charge, they replaced battery once before 6 months was out and it's gone again. Does not hold a charge at all. the plastic guides broke off both sets of blades. I ended up using battery and blades from second set I got, and same thing happened to them. I loved the knife when it worked but save the time and aggrevation and buy a regular corded electric knife."
3,rechargeable knife,"I have had my knife for about a year, and I love it. Bought one for my son, and he loves it also. However mine has a short in the switch, and I dont know for sure if they can be fixed, and if it is really worth buying a new one. My husband can usually fix anything, but I dont think the case comes apart...I used this knife all the time until it broke..also on mine the little black plastic pieces on the knife fell off right away....still deciding weather to buy a new one."
1,Sonic Blade is garbage,"The knife was great out of the box. Worked well for 6 months and then the battery would no longer hold a charge. Sonic Blade is no longer manufactured, so replacement batteries can not be obtained. Don't buy this garbage, it is a waste of money!"
2,discouraged,the battery only last about 2 minutes and then it cuts real slow. I charged it for 2 days before using it.
1,sonic blade sucks,"The sonic blade has no power and the battery has such a short charge to it that it really is awfull. I wish I had read the reveiws first. I would have never purchased this junk. I wish I could get a refund. Maybe someone can start a suit and we can all be a part of it and get refunds. Yes, that is a good ideal."
1,are you kidding,This knife cannot keep a charge after 4 months. There is no customer service. I threw it in the trash last week.
1,Worthless,"I wish I had read the reviews. It gets one star because you can't rate it at zero. This knife is a piece of garbage. The first time I charged the battery it worked great. The first recharge and the battery is shot. It can't even cut air! STAY AWAY. If you read my review or any of the others that all share the same problem and still buy one of these you only have yourself to blame. The 30 day window to return is a joke because the battery works for about 45 days or so.Amazon, take this product off your listings."
3,Battery doesn't hold the charge,"The knife is working very good, slices nicely and precisely, but the battery doesn't hold the charge...Have to charge it before every use, lasts for only few minutes or slices...Other than that, very good product, easy to use, cuts nicely...."
2,not like on TV,"The main asset is it's convenience, if you have counter space to place this item. It does NOT slice through all the items as seen on TV. The blades do not seem sharp enough to do that. For example, on hard crusted bread, such as French or Italian, I have to use both hands (which is dangerous, I know) in order to make the cut. For more difficult cuts, I suggest a corded version."
1,Waste of MONEY!!,"Never worked well. After a few charges, and it's never charged when you need it (takes 24 hrs)it stopped working. I would have returned it but it was a gift and don't know where it came from. It's in the trash. DON'T BUY!!"
3,sonic review,"I have no problem with the sonic. The knife is ok. I do have a problem with your directions for ordering form. I was in a hurry, and I did not know I was ordering the more expensive knive from an outside source. I paid full price I would have liked, if the directions were more clear to have recieved the unit that was on special at around 39.95, perhaps a rebuilt item.Paul Pugh"
1,Horrible product. No customer service. You are on your own!,The battery did not work. The website doesn't exist. You can go through the manual for hours and not find a customer service number. Better business bureau should shut them down.
1,Awful piece of crap,This electric knife stopped working after only a little while. This is the worst product I have ever purchased. Save your money!!!!!!!!1
1,Not What advertised,[[ASIN:B001SAV7IU Sonic Blade Cordless Power Knife with accessories don't order this knife. I was so disapointed it does not cut through frozen meat or anything else frozen. It barley cuts anything. It's very heavy and a pain to use plus you have to keep holding the switch on or it shuts off. Cutting a turkey is a real hassel. My old electric knife that I've had for years puts circles around this knife.
1,Don't waste your money,"Knife works great until the battery will no-longer take a charge, maybe six to eight months. I used it very little, so I think it died way too soon. The straight set of blades (slicing) fell apart about the third time I used it. I would not recommend this knife to anyone."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I have a 1994 Land Cruiser, and my local Toyota dealer wasn't helpful in providing a part number fora wiring harness for my hitch. I found the Hopkins T connector on Amazon and immediately bought itso I could wire up my hitch to drive home my new camper. The detailed instructions and ample lengthwires were just what I needed and within 2 hours (I'm not the most handy when it comes to my vehicle, either)everything was wired up, tested, and my Toyota rear panels all secured back to normal. Someone experiencedcould install this in an hour I have no doubt."
5,Quality product at reasonable price,"Package arrived within estimated arrival time.All items are packaged neatly and included within the package.Instructions are very ceasy to follow. (Only take 15 minutes)Overall, Hopkins made a quality product for specific vehicles at reasonable price."
1,Please.....Do not waste money on this Creative Zen,"I was getting excited again when i heard about the new Zen Vision coming out, but guess what?My Creative Zen PMC died for the 3rd time!!!!!Same hard drive error. Error message 5.I've tried my best to barely even use the thing this time, used only ""official"" music, and still it fails.I don't have the patience to deal with their customer service all over again.I'll probably just get a cheap Iriver or maybe an Archos if I'm feeling empty without video.If the new Zen Vision is anything like this one in terms of hardware quality or the amount (or lack of) software updates, I say good luck to anyone who wants to risk that venture.Good job with the battery life of the PMC and your sound cards Creative.Everything else, not very creative at all.Trust me, read the forums on the Creative website. Then you'll see what I mean."
1,"If I could give it less than one star, I would","The player had to be reset often while it was working as there would be no sound or it wouldn't turn on. About 6 months after I bought this player the battery died so I replaced it. Since then the player won't work. It flashes error screens and none of the ""fixes"" on the creative site work to repair the issue with the firmware, the device is not recognized as being connected. Microsoft is aware of the issue and they say it's creatives problem and suggested some options that did not help. When I phoned Creative they told me that they no longer make this product and would replace it (at my expense) with a newer version (I purchased it in June 07). There is no fix option for this player should it break, you will never be able to update any software for it or diagnose problems with it on the Creative support site. Creative is a terrible company and I would not recommend that anyone purchase this item. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would."
3,When it works it's good,"Last Saturday I bought one and after a couple of days the built-in speaker broke down. So I brought it back, my new one didn't work at all didn't recharge or anything so I brought it back and the latest that I have works but there was no battery in the box. But after reading other reviews I saw that there were not reallt problems with broken PMC's so probably the store sold used player because the boxes were not new and already opened. But in the time it worked I enjoyed it and I like it very much."
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I notice there are many good songs on this CD, but how come that song by the Rolling Stones ""You can't always get what you want"" is not included on the Big Chill soundtrack? Gee, that song was in the beginning of the movie and a great opening for that film. So what happened?"
5,The Big Chill,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
2,Almost there..........,"This CD has all the makings of a great project- the provocative and still-timely work of H.P. Lovecraft and the imagination of Nox Arcana rolled into a well packaged and recorded form. Still, I get the feeling that the music is lacking something important. The pieces start capably, rumbling along nicely with ""voice of doom"" choirs and brooding keyboards. However, after the stage is set with all of this, no melodic development or ""B"" section occurs and no other instruments are tossed into the mix. After 3 or 4 creepy tunes the project starts to run in place. I give these guys high marks for their invention of cool ""seance soundtracks"" but the execution feels kinda uninspired...."
3,"Good, but not great...","I really wanted to like this CD, and I do... somewhat. But I bought it as background music for role-playing sessions and for that purpose I find it a bit lacking. The CD is only about 40 minutes long, meaning it could get repetitive over a several hour gaming session. But more importantly, the songs themselves are short, so the seemingly constant transition from one song to another is a real mood-breaker. When it comes to background music, I prefer epic-length songs (8+ minutes)that allow me to get lost in the music without constant reminders that I'm listening to a CD (Tribes of Neurot does this well).The CD is alright... and spooky. But as an RPG tool, it doesn't work very well for me."
3,Cool Picture but overall design not worth it,"I really love the photo that is used on this poster, and bought it due to that uniqueness. However, it was only when I received the physical poster when I noticed the rest of the poster. The font of the title ""trainspotting"" is written in a way very unlike the official font, which makes it look very unofficial.Trust me, if you want the pride of hanging a trainspotting poster on your wall, get an official one-- it will be much cooler.. even if you like the photo on this poster more. Not worth it!That's just my opinion, though. I just recommend you really look at the details of the poster before purchasing it."
5,The Big Lift is a realstic gripping drama.,"Paul Douglas, Montgomery Clift, and the beautiful Bruni Lobel are all outstanding in this realistic and true life drama of the heroic but dangerous and critical Air Force transport lifeline which sustained post war West Berlin during the attempt by the Soviets to isolate and strangle it. Airmen noncoms Douglas and Clift exhibit genuinely different attitudes based on their previous war experiences, but both carry on and still manage to become involved along the way with attractive frauleins albeit with very different and intriguing results. This movie is well worth the investment."
5,Another marvelous Monty movie...,"Having had a crush on Montgomery Clift since my teens, I have seen every movie he made during his short life. My favorite is Red River, but The Big Lift has just entered my heart. Monty is such the romantic. With his dark hair, thin frame, and piercing eyes he makes you want to hug and protect him.He is vulnerable in this film to a German woman looking to escape Berlin to be with her lover in St. Louis. She charms Monty into wanting to marry her and take her to the USA. In the end, when he discovers her affections are for another, he is crushed, as was I. You just don't take advantage of Monty that way! I was glad to see everyone turn their backs on her.The military footage, plane sequences, and constant reiteration of the difference between Democray and Communism is to be expected as this is a wartime film. But the real story is about the deception of heart."
3,"""They fly when even the birds don't dare!""","This DVD's manufacturer, California-based VINA DISTRIBUTOR offers a number of public domain titles, also Mexican and other Spanish language films. Their website seems to have vanished since a mid-2009 check.THE BIG LIFT (1950) has been available on home video since the mid-1980s. Most dubs of this post-WWII drama are in unrestored condition.The film transitions from a newsreel-type documentary on the 1948-49 Berlin Airlift that supplied a city cordoned off by Soviet forces, to a drama of two sergeants (played by Monty Clift and Paul Douglas) of the newly named U.S. Air Force. By the story's conclusion, the vastly different attitudes of these men on the German people, as well as their personal politics, are changed by individual encounters with some of the locals.Shot on location amid a ruined Berlin, the grainy b&w; bleakness of this slow-paced movie is surpassed only by the devastation of its environment. Primarily for WWII completists."
3,Good story but poor quality,"The plot of this movie is good but the quality of the print is poor. The story is set during the Berlin airlift in 1948 and it gives a good feeling of what it was like in postwar Berlin. However, the quality of this DVD detracts from the viewing experience."
4,The Big Lift,"The Big Lift is a period piece about the erecting of the Berlin Wall and how Berlin is kept alive by air lifting supplies. It is a bit of a propaganda film as the viewer is ""instructed"" to not be too distrustful of post WWII Germans nor to trustful either. Other than that, this is a feeding frenzy for ""wing nuts"" that is, aviation aficionados. Great shots of cargo planes in action."
4,Context Is the Key,"In spite of the title and promotional text, the story of the Berlin Airlift is actually only the context of the story of love and betrayal between an American GI and a German civilian in post-war Berlin. The black-and-white picture and sound quality are low, but the scenery is compelling. In 1948 Berlin, we see the extent of devastation left over from the War, including shots of the Brandenburg Gate and the Bundestag. Some amazing shots are provided of US transports flying below the level of apartment roofs on the approach to the Air Force landing field. Comic relief is provided by a sub-plot regarding the spilling of paint on the GI's uniform, and its loss by the German cleaner. As the main characters hide from American MPs, they flee into the Soviet sector, then escape Soviet guards by fleeing into the British sector."
5,"COOKIES! COOKIES!! oh, err, um, EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!!","This is a cool cookie jar. The head is the lid, so you can swivel the head around to point it in different directions while you're munching on that cookie and saying ""EXTERMINATE!!"". The body is pretty big and holds a decent amount of yummies. The paint job is well done and has the kind of detail one would expect for a cookie jar bent on taking over the universe. The eye stalk, plunger arm and gun arm are fixed in place, so be careful putting things near it. This goes great with the TARDIS cookie jar, BTW."
5,Great Biography!,"Well written biography of Marie-Therese, only child of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI who survived into adulthood. Alice Curtis Desmond does a nice job describing Marie-Therese's childhood at Versailles and her subsequent imprisonment during the French Revolution. She then details the next 50 years of her life, as she constantly moves all around Europe, never quite settling in one place. Fascinating!"
3,I was hoping for a better biography.,"This book was written in the 1960's by a lady fortunate to have the opportunities to travel and see the localities and read the original source papers. She had the access and the professional background to write an interesting biography. Instead she wrote a story based on the facts, and seems to have written it for a target audience of grade school children. I haven't finished the book yet. Got to about chapter 3 and put it down. I may pick it up later, but it's not on my 'must do' list."
4,"Nice one, Alice","This book is very well written and strong on facts. Mrs. Desmond is obviously an accomplished American writer. I say American because every possible American character that touches on the main story is dragged in. If you are American you will love it. I am not and felt that some of the other characters suffered as a result. In particular, Marie Therese's time in Jelgava (she spells it Yelgava, which is incorrect) is given short shrift. This is a formative time in Marie Therese's life and deserves more detail. Perhaps such details are unavailable. On the whole a good book to read in bed."
3,Get Over Yourselves,"Seriously, reviewers, get over yourselves. This is a budget release for the very casual fan or someone who is just looking for one song. Here's how it works: Sony has the majority of the Cheap Trick catalog. They release a variety of""Best Of/Greatest Hits"" packages at various prices and numbers of tracks to appeal to different interest levels of purchasers. The dreaded Sony is not a bunch of obsessive-compulsive collectors, they're business people trying to make a buck in the increasingly difficult music biz. You wanna buy the lavish and completist Box Set? Fine. You don't like how Sony treats the Cheap Trick catalog?Fine. Be angry at the sun for rising. This is a $6.99 list CD, which is currently selling on Amazon for A PENNY. As such, it has some good tunes and if it gives people pleasure, what harm is done? It's like criticizing an auto manufacturer for making a basic subcompact as well as the $50K GT Sports Coupe. ""Different strokes for different folks"" we used to say."
1,"Buy this, and you are a moron","If you are hardcore Cheap Trick Fan and you buy this, you are an idiot. There are plenty of other cds that are much better under the Cheap Trick name. Try Authorized Greatest Hits leave these crap to rot on the shelves forever. I curse you Sony, Stop putting out all this crap. I don't know who has more crap put out by you guys, ELO or Cheap Trick. And both bands deserve better."
4,Great supplement.,"We've been giving this to our 14 year old Australian Shepherd for about a month now, in conjunction with Glyco-Flex III. It is impossible to know which supplement is helping him more, but the combination of the two is working wonders. He has a lot of difficulty with stability in general, and getting up and lying down. This has helped his mobility tremendously, without the side effects of prescription meds."
2,Makes No Difference,I've used this product for my dog for over a year since taking other pain meds upset her stomach which is already not that good.I can't see that it helps her in anyway. I just kept giving them to her thinking well maybe it is working but I'm giving up on them.
1,All I got was a empty box!,I got a empty box. I got a refund but what I wanted was the movie! I had all my snacks ready to watch it and the dvd box was empty. I am so disappointed! I would have watched it several times by now!
5,Still a favorite,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I had a VHS copy that my dad had purchased because he had loved it as a kid. My oldest daughter, now 10, loves it too! She watched it on the VHS version but I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD and instant. I love it that this movie is still so popular. I still love watching it. One of the few movies that my kids love that I also sincerely enjoy."
4,Good old fashioned comedy.,If you like comeddy that is wholesome - this is it. I would be nice that one day we would get It Happens Every Spring on DVD too.
2,"I would say"" PASS"" on this one!!!","I love Bunny Williams but this book is a big let-down. Maybe I was spoiled after reading ""Affair with a House""."
1,cheep stroller,Had my stroller for about 2 months and the wheel in the front is bent and i cant fix it.. very cheeply made.. Also the kids sit way to far back not impressed do not recomend...........
2,Seat is too Short!,"We just tried this stroller out in the store. I have an 8 month old and a 3 year old who is 38"" tall. The top of the seatbacks have a metal bar that the fabric is attached to. My son laid back in the seat (which riders are forced to do since the seats do not sit upright) and his head hit on the metal bar. Ouch! So, back to searching!"
5,THE most tasty ambient album ever....I promise,"If you meditate, take brain altering chemicals, have trouble sleeping or just want to learn what chillin' is all about this is your ticket. I've had this album for a while (perhaps it was released much earlier in Britain) but it's well worn so I'm buying a back up copy. If you have any sense of taste then this will go straight into your ultimate top ten. Think Orbital in suspended animation. Building cresendos coming wave after gentle wave. It's gonna stop your heart and steal your mind.This is truly beautiful music.Take my advice - I'm doin' you a favour - buy it and know you'll see I mean"
3,"""Loose Nut""","For an 80's pop sound, this one is still pretty good, despite the rather deflated drum sound. Check out 'Bastard', 'I'm The One', 'Best One', and 'Sinking'."
4,always root for the bull,great story about a legend. great bull riding videos; shows some brave fellows getting injured.
1,Not worth the $,Very disappointed in the quality of the video. Amaturish film of a truly great bull. Definately not worth buying new.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"WHEN WE FIRST WATCHED BODACIOUS WE WERE SIMPLY DUMB STRUCK....WE ARE SO DIAPPOINTED WITH IT THE CONTENT OF THE VHS TAPE. WE WERE EXPECTING MUCH,MUCH MORE. THE ADVERTISTMENTS WERE DECEIVING. WE ARE COWBOYS AT HEART AND THIS TAPE LACKED THE EXCITEMENT, THE THRILL, AND THE ""EXPERIENCE"" OF BULL RIDING. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TAPE TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR THE UNEXPECTED HEART STOPPING ACTION, BULL RIDING ACHIEVES."
1,Total Bull!!,"I have always been thrilled to watch bull riding! While tuning in to world class bull riding recently I saw an ad for this tape. I have always wanted to see more of Bodacious because he is such an amazing animal and there have been so many thrilling incidents with him. I was charged a whopping 19.95 plus 4.95 shipping for this 26 minute joke! Since several minutes in the beginning and the end are distorted or in fast motion, I figure there is about 15 minutes of film, much of which is shown and reshown. They show Tuf Hedeman's ""pass"" in riding Bodacious but don't even show the ride that injured him so badly that he felt he had to ""pass"" on the next ride! With all of the thrilling action that goes on at Rodeos and how often they are filmed I would have expected to see more than what I did. I wish there was a way to get my money back!"
5,Must read!,"I couldn't put the book down. so much information and written with good humor. My child has down's syndrome and although the book does not discuss this condition, it clarified alot of a child's developmental abilities and offers hope to the human potential that exists in all our children. Loved it! I will be forwarding it to my friend with a cp child."
3,Good for VHS,I was disappointed that I could not find these cartoons on a DVD. There was a little flipping (rolling) at the beginning of this tape and the cartoons are classic so it was worth it in the long run.
3,Screwy Squirrel,There was not enough Screwy Squirrel. I was very disappointed when I only saw one cartoon with him in it.
3,Review of ANSYS Tutorial 8 Release,"I bought this release hoping that the tutorial would throw some light on advanced analysis capabilities like explicit dynamics etc. However, this release at best acquaints the reader with ANSYS 8 and how he could work on basic static steady state problems using it. It is a good reference for all starters who wish to get familiarised with elementary analysis capabilities of ANSYS."
2,bobbin mechinism keeps breaking needles,"I have been satisfied with singer sewing machines in the past so was happy when my daughter purchased this machine for me as a gift.This is the third time I have used it. The first two times I had no problems sewing bathroom curtains and patching a couple pairs of pants. This time however, while doing a straight stitch for a hem the needle kept jamming in the bobbin area breaking three needles. I noticed that there was a clinking sound when the needle would go down below the machine surface. Upon further inspection I noticed the needle was hitting on the toothlike part in the bobbin area. I have changed needles, tried to readjust the foot and even tested various fabrics to see if there would be a difference, but to no avail. I spent a good two hours trying to trouble shoot this problem (spent more time troubleshooting then actual sewing). I have given up for now.If anyone has a solution, I'd love to hear about it."
5,sewing,"i am enjoying the singer machine very much. have had higher dollar machines but this one sews very well and is simple to operate.i trust the singer brand and i am glad i ordered it from amazon. the entire order went through very well and with good speed, as well as arriving in a very timely manner."
4,Rap and goth don't go together!,"I liked most of this cd, but I don't know what was up with sticking a rap song at the end of a goth/industrial comp? I really like Alkaline Trio's cover of Lucretia My Reflection."
3,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be!!!,"I bought this because it has a song called Everyday is HALLOWEEN. It wasn't what I expected. In fact, the only song on this CD I liked was Lucretia My Reflection. I probably wouldn't recommend BLACK HEART RETROSPECTIVE!!!"
5,Nice...Very Nice...,"Picked this up, not really knowing what to expect, but in turn I was pleasantly surprised! It's a nice mix of 80's Pop/Goth mix, my favorite song ""Everyday Is Halloween"" by Ministry.I definitely think it was worth the money!"
5,another amazing album after Zen Arcade & New Day Rising,"It constantly blows me away how damn good Husker Du was. I mean, they played their music as if it could be everything at once -- the power of punk, the sheer melody of pop, and the emotions of alternative. And darned if they didn't succeed. This album is probably the best ""introduction"" to the Huskers from a normal rock fan's point of view -- not as sprawling as ""Warehouse,"" but not as hard as ZA and NDR.Perfect songs: Every Everything. Makes No Sense at all. Green Eyes. Divide and Conquer. Games. Find Me. Flexible Flyer. I could listen to these beautiful powerful songs over and over. Husker Du were my Beatles -- brilliant fusionists, singers, songwriters, and performers. Here's why."
4,Now that's more like it...,"I won't mask anything-New Day Rising pretty much sucked to me.It was a long mess of song fragments. Fearing that the next album would be even worse, I waited awhile untill I checked this one out. To my surprise, this is a really good album. Yeah, they slowed the songs down and don't yell as much, but this is a nice little set of melodies. A lot of hardcore bands kind of suck once they slow down (Circle Jerks) but this is great. As usual the first track starts perfectly, quite soothing. (Remember how the other two made you want to go out and rip things up)You can easily where Green Day got there lust for melodic rock from. The only thing is the production. I actually prefer punk music muddy and lo-fi, but man this is mixed horribly. It's got way too much treble, Greg Norton's bass is muffled, just like the drums. This would have gotten a 5 if it wasn't for that fact alone."
5,You WILL Flip Your Wig over this one.,Husker Du was the best punk/rock band ever. Get this CD and discover why!
3,Some of the best apples come after the fall...,"This album marks the beginning of Husker Du's decline. The clean production allows Mould & Hart the space to air out some nice lyrics and give us some tasty riffs, but only two songs really stand out for me: ""Flexible Flyer"" and ""Green Eyes"". Both are Hart songs, AFAIK, but they illustrate the level of synergy that Hart & Mould could achieve at their best: ""Green Eyes"", the drummer's song, has one of the most achingly beautiful guitar solos (and probably the only power-chord solo that I'd dream of calling ""beautiful"") ever recorded.If you're a Du fan, you should own this if only to hear what Mould was capable of on guitar before he got civilized."
3,Jumping the shark.. but making it..,"at the time this record came out I was sad.. hurt and broken up by the fonz jumping over the shark,.. or was is that who ever produced this didnt know how to mic drums.. and I thought there was only 2 or 3 good songs on it.. but now.. compared to the poo that is out there.. its a great record.. I still say ""thier jumping the shark on this one... but a last good effort..(www.ghlysptwld.com)"
2,I don't get it at all,"I read reviews of this album that make it sound so incredibly awesome that I can't bring myself to sell it. I'm convinced I'm missing something. The songs sound generic and boring to me. Nothing really takes off; it's all a mush of unadventurous and uninteresting guitar rock. Husker Du is often listed alongside bands like Minor Threat and their 90's incarnation Fugazi as being among the noble fathers and seminal bands of hardcore punk. I don't see it. There's no fury here. Even Bad Religion is more vital-sounding than this.There's a couple of good songs here. It's certainly preferable listening to the popular crap invading MTV and the airwaves today, but if you really want to find hardcore gems, stick to Youth of Today and Minor Threat. If you just want some quality punk rock - how could you go wrong with The Clash?"
4,Fictional story of Ancient Egypt's First Dynasty,"This fictional account is of a girl who becomes co-pharaoh of Egypt with her brother during the First Dynasty. It is lyrically and almost magically written, giving a sense how ancient Egyptians might have thought about themselves, their life and their religion. It is, however, hard to know and separate what are solely the imaginings of the author from what is based on known facts about ancient Egypt at that time."
5,Brilliant,"This book has more First Edition Feel than anything I've ever seen, including First Edition. More wandering prostitutes, more random obscure colours and more random exclamation points than you'd believe possible as well as some seriously aggravating iconic NPCs and monsters."
5,"A hoot, a laugh, and tons of useful material!","With its fresh feel that puts traditional gamers' ""panties in a bunch"", this product is a must have for any DM who wants to add some extra color to his or her game. With a variety of new (and often amusing) feats, as well as the ever-defining defects, your NPCs will become memorable aspects of the world you craft for your players. Stop wasting your money on the same old d20 material that every other company puts out and get this book!"
5,Skirmisher Does It Again!,"This irreverent and at times off-color resource takes D&D back to its roots, which, quite frankly, were sometimes irreverent and off-color. Some of these nuisances may hit a little close to home for some, but they have a place in every party. I found them hilarious. Bottom line: you gotta buy this one. Do it! Do it now!"
5,Worth it for the humor if nothing else,This book is mostly intended to make you laugh but hiding among the strangeness are a few very useful little tid bits.
4,Laugh out loud funny,"Ultimately, I buy RPG supplements because I am looking for new ideas to incorporate into my games. This book has about a thousand funny and interesting ideas that can easily be tossed in to just about any scenario. With chapters like Random Nuisances (#1) and Brothels and Prostitutes (#2), it's hard to go wrong. While much of the book is strictly for shock and humor value, there are actually quite a few charts, feats, defects, etc. that can turn your bland NPCs (or even PCs) into memorable people or a boring encouter to an unforgettable one. It seems like Skirmisher plays these games to have FUN, and this book reminded me that in the end, that's what it should all be about. Well, that and Succubi prostitutes with braided armpit hair, halitosis, and bad dandruff."
3,Not worth the money.,"Though interesting there should be more on the different Cherokee companies. It dosen't really hit on them. And for the price of this video, which was...... when I bought it, it comes to just over a dollar a minute. 27 minutes is on Stand Watie, the rest is all commercials on other videos available from Tully Entertainment. 8 minutes on the Navajo Code Talkers, 5 minutes on War Dogs-Canines in War, and the last 4 minutes on Seawolves of Vietnam. A total of 17 minutes of commercials. I could see paying...... at Wal-Mart for the video but no more than that."
3,average,"nothing fantastic. i bit on a light weight size. i guess because they make this stuff in china these days, they tend to skimp on quality. but for the price, its usable. and the best part, its got no poisonous aluminum in the core of it, but just copper."
2,Didn't stand the Test of Time,"I have been very pleased with this skillet; I felt the weight was appropriate and I too appreciate the fact that there is no aluminum in it. Copper is a great heat conductor. I also liked that it didn't have a nonstick coating, which always has a short life. Unfortunately, this skillet did too. I bought it 3 1/2 years ago, probably use it 3 to 4 times a week. I heard some loud crackings when I used it the other day and discovered that the copper base had warped- it has a large 'bubble' raised on the underside of the pan. I don't believe it's safe to use, and this time I'm going to spend a little more money and get something that will last."
2,I am not a stickfree pan,"I bought this copper advantage copper base pan because it did not have the black coating like the other pans, but this pan when you use it, everything sticks to it. I use olive oil now because thats better for me. I had no idea that I would be straping the food out of this pan. Even food does not stick, sticks to this one. Would not recomend this pan to anyone."
4,The baddest Brains?,"Like many, this is the album that really got me into the music of Bad Brains. Funny what 50 cents will get you at a pawn shop. Anyway, this is probably the first album to pick up from them, and maybe also their best. I hesitate to call it metal, but it leans in that direction more than some of their earlier more punk albums. However ""I Against I"" blends punk and metal like typical Ministry would blend industrial and metal. Obviously both work extremely well. My fave tracks here besides the title track, are ""Let Me Help"", ""Re-Ignition"", and the awesome ""Return To Heaven"". If you don't pick this album up, I suggest the self-titled, or the ""Banned In DC"" collection."
4,still great,"no doubt about it this is a great album,but when your living up to an album like ""rock for light"",it had to be good following such a classic.a good follow up,but can not match the previous material.."
4,Great hardcore album for a great hardcore band,this is one of the greatest punk-hardcore albums ever released. this was my first exerience with bad brains and it blew me away. the only reason i gave it a 4 stars is because before you buy this you should buy their self titled album. i am a serious punk fan. take it from me this is a great release.
4,Not quite what i expected..Not real bad but not real good,"Ive been a fan of these guys for a while now and have found a few Lps by them, out of what ive found this is definatly the least favorite. One thing i always liked about the Bad Brains was how they tied reggae in with harder music. This album has none of that, its pretty much all rock with little variety and a slight funk feel. Overall it really isnt a bad album and id recommend it to anyone.. After they get there earlier ones first."
5,Awwwww Cheeezit!!,You want a GREAT rock record???..get this!!!..I would rather hit myself in the crotch with a hammer than live without it.
2,"Geez, a big disappointment!","After the furious ""Rock For Light,"" this album was a MAJOR disappointment! The hardcore tempo that swept the listener through RFL is *gone*, replaced by a standard sludgy metal boom-boom-boom. Dr. Know's jazz-influenced guitar is also *gone,* replaced by lazy constant soloing over a 1/2-time rhythm section. ""I Against I,"" ""Let Me Help,"" ""House of Suffering"" and ""Return to Heaven"" certainly have their moments, but by and large, the album is self-indulgent and a betrayal of hardcore fans."
3,THE MISSING BALL GLOVE,"IRONIC AND FUNNY (AN I CAN READ)READER. OLDER IS USUALLY BETTER. IT'S CUTE AND IT'S ANOTHER GOOD BOY BOOK. THESE OLDER BOOKS ARE JUST BETTER FOR THE OLD FASHIONED FAMILIES AND MOST HOMESCHOOLERS THAT I KNOW. THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED, BY THE WAY."
3,"Darn it,Its Modern twisted retelling !","You think you've seen it, Then they re-invent Mary Shelley's Monster Wheel. I should start with the cast: RHETT GILES as Victor Franks/The Doctor, He has this Alan Rickman-Snape from Harry Potter twist. JOEL HEBNER (Need to interview) plays the reborn creature,I can't exactly say as Bernie Wrightson would draw him---But, Close. The editing was challenging to watch at first, Kind of like ""Memento"". Alot of scenes will make you feel all squishy for tributes- There is the Babysitter scene from first ""Halloween"", The interrogation moment from ""Silence Of The Lambs"", I loved the ""Kolchak"" moment the shrink had with a microphone at end. This would have been a Great Ending, Not the teaser throwaway that smacks sequel."
1,Limited to hospital transcription,"This book is only worth the money that you pay for it. There is really nothing wrong with it, but it deals only with hospital transcription. It presents only one format for each type of report. Having only transcribed for clinics, I really cannot judge whether or not is is relevant to a large range of hospitals. When we used this text in college, it was accompanied by a set of tapes, and the book served as a guide for data on the patients being dictated on. By itself, it is of limited value."
4,Great little accent piece,Better then I expected for the money and the item came fully assembled it's a great corner accent piece and was well worth the money
4,High-brow Christianity and its discontents,"As a novel Gardner's The Flight of Peter Fromm is somewhat lacking in narrative force and cohesion, probably because Gardner is not really a novelist (this is his only effort in that direction). But it is unsurpassed as a panoramic view of high-brow Christianity in the the twentieth century and its many discontents. It provided me of a good understanding of contemporary religious thought and of the emotional forces that drive it. It is surprising how much ground Gardner covers in this slim volume, providing lucid and vivid descriptions of the work of the religious existentialists, of Barth, Tillich, Chesterton and the neo-Thomists, the Unitarian humanists and of the underpinning emotional forces that drive these various attempts to conserve religion in the face of a scientific worldview that denies its fundamental factual claims and a high-brow worldview that rejects many of its moral teachings."
5,Running Down a Dream,"It sounds trite but with this film, it's true: if you don't see any other sports flicks, see this one!! What an eye-opener. Finally a great movie about WOMEN in sports. There are great highlights of Kaz in this film. She is awesome. The film will break your heart. I've already seen it twice!! Definitely a ""must-see."""
3,"Good story, but won't hold kids attention","I got this to show to my junior high basketball team (girls) and they couldn't have been more bored with it. The production quality is poor, the music is not modern and there is too much in there about the recruiting aspect of the game. I really was hoping it would show more highlights of the player and less of the all the recruiting stuff. Good story though, parents would get something out of it if they have kids who are getting recruited and facing the pressure of all that."
4,"I LIKE IT ALOT, BUT......","""Up on the Sun"" just might be the masterpiece that everyone says it is. But on the same day I bought ""Up on the Sun"" I also bought ""Meat Puppets: Monsters"". I enjoy the relaxing mood and accoustic rock of ""Up on the Sun"", but I think ""Monsters"" fits the title Masterpeice alot better. But this is a ""Up on the Sun"" review. ""UP on the Sun"" is exactly what Meat Puppets frontman Curt Kirkwood says it is, "" The Grateful Dead album for people who hate the Grateful Dead"". I couldnt of said it better myself. The album is a soothing mix of accoustic instrumentation but it still keeps its punk rock edge. My favorite songs are ""Up on the Sun"", ""Away"", ""Swimming Ground"" and the ""Hot Pink"" instrumental at the end."
1,very dissapointing,"I bought this record assuming the songs would be as poignant and memorable as those on II. Instead, I found the music to be busy and impersonal, and I thought the lyrics (once again in comparison to those on II) sucked. Its often said that Up on the Sun demonstrates the Meat Puppets coming into their own 'sound', and that its a vast improvement over II. I fail to see how their work on II was any less of a genuine expresssion of the bands vision than this frankly dull piece of work."
2,You guys are crazy,"What the hell is up with all these 5 star ratings?? Man. Meat Puppets 2 deserves 5 but this one? Up on the Sun is full of lame guitar licks, annoying whistling, chanting, wtf?? MP 2 is like a piece of art while this one is more like a piece of crap, sorry guys."
4,"I want to rate this as 4 and a half stars, so you know","I bought this album about the same time as I bought 'Too High to Die' and at first I preferred 'Up on the Sun' because it was more true to the 'Pups previous records, with it's psychadelic guitar and passionate vocals, especially on the title track, as well as the tracks 'Swimming Ground' and 'Seal Whales'. I say 'at first' because I came to be more addicted to 'Too High to Die'...if you're used to cleaner sounding lyrics and riffs that are fairly easy-going, go for 'Too High to Die', if you love the 'Pups for their excellent alternative riffs, backed by some brilliantly vivid imagery (lyrically and musically) and want a truly original, alternative record -(not that the others aren't, just that this one is more so than some of the later ones) -go for this one."
4,"A real Faith-Builder of the modern day ""Book of Acts.""","This book was passed to me by the Director of Education for our missions department. Rarely do I enjoy books that are mailed because of the recommendation of someone else. I usually like to browse the bookstores for myself to find something that would benefit me. Who better knows what I like to read than me?At any rate, I picked up Beyond Imagination and found it to be a book about real people working out real miracles exercising the power of a real God. This book is nothing short than a modern-day Book of Acts. Should we expect anything less if faith in God is evident. Jesus said, ""...the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do;..."" (John 14:12 KJV)."
3,A good travel bood,I bought 3 books before we went to Trinidad and they were all good in their own way. The trip was a surprise to my husband for our 22nd anniversary and definitely gave us lots of information and we felt prepared for anything we would find.
5,Stong Stuff,The content and pace of this interview is strong. I'm an accountant by profession and trade as a hobby; and the information contained in this interview blew me away.If you think you know what your doing in the financial markets you MUST expose yourself to this message. Failure to do is unquantifiable.
5,Harp & guitar,That is right Great harmonica & guitar from two of the best. This is a very good cd. Glad to have it in my collection.
3,Lights..Camera...Some Action!!,"This movie had some high hopes for me...it was good, but not great. The film opens with action right from the get go, so you think you are in for a real treat!! Dialogue between the actors in this film is pretty good, chemistry is definately there between all three main characters. Problem is...yes it is a movie, but some of the action sequences are very unbelievable!!Good shoot-em' up kind of movie, but if you are looking for better substance and more believablity, look to Assault on Precicnt 13..."
3,PRETTY GOOD ACTION MOVIE!!,"I'M NOT MUCH ON ACTION FILMS, BUT THIS ONE WAS PRETTY GOOD!!THE PLOT WAS COOL AND THE ACTING WAS PRETTY GENERIC...BUT THE MOVIE IS NOT TOO BAD!!THIS WAS AN OKAY ACTION MOVIE WITH A PREMISE THAT COULD BE A REALY 'GREAT' MOVIE WITH A BIGGER BUDGET AND BETTER ACTORS!!"
3,"Good, but old and incomplete","Well-written and excellent for novices. However whole topics are either skipped over hastily (e.g. troubleshooting) or omitted altogether (e.g. multimedia support). A bit out-of-date, considering it covers the original release, prior to all Service Packs. Even MS's support site offers more in-depth info on variety of issues.Still, a handy desktop reference. Those who want to dive in deep may want to look elsewhere."
3,Great Bookcase-BUT.......,"Definitely,a 'two man' job.PROS:Came well packaged,and all parts included.Very good quality and style.Nice,sturdy adjustable shelves.CONS:Assembling the backboard was a NIGHTMARE!Two pieces of paper thin plywood fit into a white ( sticks out like a 'sore thumb')plastic strip with a slot in it.Because the panels wobble,they keep popping out of the grooves.Also,some holes were not pre-drilled.SUMMARY: I like the bookcase but would not buy another,unless the backboard was rigid.Also,don't push your books back and hit the backboard!"
1,Barn of the BORED Dead!,"Ok, I don't care who is putting out what version, all this talk of the film, and the intriguing title, made me want to rent this, and I wasted a rental on this. I can't judge the quality, for the film is NOT 16x9 enhanced, which should be the norm nowadays, nor is it progressively scanned, so the picture played weird on my player. And to top it off NO NAKED DEAD! Just a moron who chains girls up and lives with his monster dad. Very amateur night, so what is the big deal? No naked deads here. Did I miss something?"
5,Response to the post below,"I released this DVD and would like to respond to these uninformed, malicious posters. This DVD is NOT mastered from a VHS tape, and it is NOT a bootleg. The quality is good, and it is an absolutely ""legit"" release, and is in no way illegal as this poster has erroneously charged. These comments are made from a group of rather vicious individuals based on unsubstantiated and biased information. The DVD speaks for itself."
3,"It is an ok movie, could have been better.","This movie is explaining about two love story happening at a different time in life, and how it was handle differently. Today's love story and yesterday's. This movie could have been written better, but the story wasnt too bad. I do agree with the other comment that the music was great. I would reccommend people to rent the movie before you make a decision to buy it.Everyone's taste is different. You might actually disagree with me."
3,Good film,"It's a film about two kinds of love, and makes a think about how important is to appreciate the meaning of love and take risks. But the thing is that there are some parts of the movie when it gets slow, nevertheless I loved the message, and totally recommended."
4,GoodGora reviews Love Aaj Kal,The movie is for the very modern Indians and probably for the Gora's too. How do you handle life in the fast lane and remain sane and connected. It is hard to do. It takes sacrifices that not all are ready to do.
2,Too many mistakes in the answer key.,"I started with the vocabulary section and found many incorrect answers in the answer key. This made me feel uncomfortable in trusting the answers in the remaining areas of the book. I purchased this book to assist me, not hinder me."
4,Beautiful & Inspiring,"This coffee-table style book introduces the natural riches of New Guinea through 196 photos accompanied by good descriptrions of each one. There are more informative books written on the topic, but as far as photographic ones go this is a nice one."
5,excellent,"I belive this book tells the true history of the APBT and anyone involved in this breed should read this book cover to cover but that is the inherit problem with a lot pit bull owners and breeders is that they don't know their dogs inside and out. The pitbulls I have owned are incredible farm dogs, I don't condone dogfighting but the realization is that dogfighting and dogmen kept this breed alive because 99% of the population didn't know what an APBT was before 1980"
1,not worthy of the paper it's printed on!,"This is a pathetic excuse for a book. Mr. Stratton seems delighted to stuff his pages full of all sorts of useful info on how to fight your pitbull ( a FELONY) and not get caught; how to befriend your local vet so that he will sew your dog back together without telling on you; and how to isolate your dog and degrade him into the agressive killer you wish he was. It is a sad commentary that this book does nothing more that feed the inhumane frenzy of scary, powerless men and women turning a defenseless puppy into an agressive fighting machine to make themselves feel big and strong. YUCK! Both the publisher and AMAZON continue to carry this book built on some first amendment call to arms. Let's have a reality check: this is no Ulysseus! Perhaps Mr. Stratton's next book can combine freedom of speech with the responsibility one should have toward innocent animals of all kinds. Why put sick work like this into the hands and minds of dangerous people?"
1,typical...,"Read this book years ago, and looking back it's almost comical in its style. 137 lb Korean chindo dogs? Korean, jindhos weigh about 45-60 lbs. Some of his claims are absurd regarding pitbulls and do the breed no favors, plus dogfighting is for criminals. So if you like biased, exaggerated portrayals of your breed this is the book for you."
1,Great book on animal abuse,"If you're a redneck w/a Pit bull and want to see lots of pictures of other rednecks w/Pit bulls, then this is the book for you. Great book on dog fighting and animal abuse. Pit bulls make wonderful pets, but you'd never know it from reading this book."
5,An excellent book by an excellent author,"I am an avid fan of the APBT and I chose to read several of Stratton's books before purchasing my first dog. Honestly, no one tells the true story concerning this breed like this author and his literature is a must for anyone interested in the breed. Contrary to popular belief, Stratton delivers the pluses and minuses pertaining to this breed with an open eye. In short, this is an excellent book for the newcomer to the breed or for the experienced."
4,A record to drink to...,"The second album by this legendary LA punk band was released in 1986 and was the first for their longtime label SST. This is a glorious mess of an album which is equally indebted to the Undertones as Beggar's Banquet-era Stones. The basic sound is punk rock via the melodic simplicity of the Buzzcocks but crashing cymbals and dissonant guitar lines as well as the absolutely puzzling lines sung by Falling James Moreland with such conviction leave the band far afield of simple punk rock a la labelmates Slovenly, the Meat Puppets and the Minutemen."
5,cheaper elsewhere,i will be the first one to say that i LOVE LOVE LOVE every single prodcut kerastase puts out but (whispering) it's $34 on their website... shhhhh...
1,Not reliable,"I bought this for my firefighter friend and he lost the magnet the first time out. With all the gear getting jostled around, the magnets became detached and one got lost. I love the idea, it just didn't work and I don't think this product is a winner."
2,Spikes Liberty Albums,These are Spike Jones Liberty Albums.His much better recordings are on RCA Victor.I wasnt too impressed with these.Id stay with his RCA 1940s years.Those are much better.
4,"Not what the band deserves, but a nice little package","Some DVDs can cost up to (dollar amount) for a product that should cost half that much. Luckily, this DVD ""single"" is less than (dollar amount) so no one will feel ripped off. The 'Ladies and Gents' making of is really an interview with J Spaceman in a church cut with some live European footage. Though the live footage usually cuts out mid-song, it is still nice to have something like this in the States, where Spiritualized has been neglected for 10 years. The ""Electricity"" video is like the ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" video, just J driving around and looking at things. The ""Come Together"" video puts J in place of Lee Harvey Oswald for a theatrical treat. There's nothing here for a non-fan, but the low price and goodies make this an essential purchase for those who listen to Spiritualized in their sleep."
5,A terrific improvement from the first game,"Dracula 2 is everything the first one wasn't. If you were disappointed with the first, I don't blame you. Although it had wonderful graphics, it was way too short. This game is ten times as long, ten times as challenging, ten times scarier and ten times BETTER! I love it!! There are many beautifully depicted environments to roam and explore freely in, all in a logical, strategy-driven way. The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible or too easy, they are perfect. It picks up right where the first game left off, so I suggest buying the first game as well. The graphics are, without a doubt, the BEST I've ever seen in a PC game. They are absoultely astounding...you really have to see them to believe it. Buy this game - it's cheap and tons of fun that will keep you busy for a long time!!"
3,"Excellent game, but it has it's flaws.","This is the second Dreamcatcher Interactive game I have bought. Excellent quality game for the price. The graphics and sound are excellent. The puzzles aren't too difficult, but clever. The storyline is long enough to enjoy the playing. It does have it's flaws though. The entire game runs from the CD-ROM making acessing the inventory take a minute or so, which is irritating at some points in the game. Also, the movement in the inventory is jerky forcing you to attempt to get an item several time. Overall, though good game and worth the money"
1,"Oh well, another turkey","I just received my Dracula 2 game from ... today. That's the good news. When you open the box the only thing inside is the jewel case which contains the two CD's and the worlds shortest ""manual"".There appears to be no way to change the resolution settings, color settings, sound or anything else. Or re-map the keyboard. Keyboard? There is nothing in the ""manual"" which shows keyboard assignments. How do you move forward? Who knows. Backwards? Run, walk or jump? Who knows. Want to use mouse invert? Sorry about that.Having played PC games for a couple of years now I am conditioned to the fact that you're gonna get ... sometimes, and this is one of those times. Think of it this way: I get to have turkey in April, because Dracula 2: the Last Sanctuary is a turkey (and it's not even Thanksgiving yet!)."
5,An Excelent game for fans of Dracula,The Lord of the Vampires has returned to London in search of Mina Harker in this thrilling sequal to Dracula: The Ressurection. You play as Jonathan Harker on a quest to save his wife from the clutches of Dracula. Witness the adventure as Jonathan uncovers the many secrets of Dracula's life and learn more of the mysterious Dragon's Ring and of a strange and horrible place where Dracula has hidden Mina. You must find her using only your wit and emotional strength. There are challenging puzzles and mysteries that Jonathan must master before he can enter the Final Sanctuary. I give this game five stars for excelent grafics and a plot that emersses you in a mess of myth and lore.
2,Dracula Schmacula!,"This game promised to be a good thing, but like most promises it was meant to be broken. The narrative graphic are beautiful and exciting however the game graphics are not really interactive. It seems as though you are just looking at a picture either up close or far away as you play. I don't like the way you have to move yourself around either, never felt involved. The directional arrows are ambiguous leaving you hanging without knowing why or what you are supposed to do. We were very disappointed."
4,Eerie Excelence,"Probably one of the best games I've played recently. Easy to manuever, great graphics and excellent storyline."
2,Pass by this game,This is not the best game out there. I'm a serious gamer and this is not a serious game here. I could have more fun out of solataire! The box looks good but the gameplay isn't there at all. You could pass this game up and not miss a thing. If you want a cool vampire game then check out Nocturne by Terminal Reality. That's a game that rocks and has tons of action and puzzles.
2,Two out of six were damaged,"Like other reviews mentioned. The low price is tempting, but 4 of the 6 bulbs were damaged. Moreover, the small carton it came in was not sealed, and was cracked. It's possible that I was sent a defective product that someone else returned.I got the Sylvania before and had no prloblems. In effect the price is not higher if you take into acocunt the Feit ones being DOA frequently, so I definitely recommend getting the Sylvania instead."
2,cheap bulbs but a dull yellow light,Got these because they were cheap but I'm not all that happy with them. The bulbs do not put out as white nor as much light as some Phillips bulbs that I had previously used. Will spend the money for the better bulbs next time.
2,I thought this book was very boring.,This book was not a good read. The character development was not impressive and the ending was very anti-climatic. This story was not half as good as her other works.
4,Goyim Christianity and Messianic Judaism,"interesting to note that messianic judaism did die when yerushalayeem died when roma burnt our beloved city to the ground and the Holy Temple destroyed by the savage romans. toda hshem (thank G'D) messianic judaism came back later on in the 20th century. one thing i noticed about the people speaking in this film failed to comment on is Shimeon (Peter) said ""Shaul's teaching are hard to understand and that people will twist his teachings to their own destruction"".too say that Paul spoke out against judaism,torah,and torah observance is not biblical and not true. when it comes to the monies that Shaul brought with him to yerushalayeem he got from his goyyim converts too the jewish believers, no one can say that the jewish believes accepted or refused the money. the scriptures never talks about what happened to the money shaul brought with him too the jewish believers.interesting film i give it 4 stars ****"
1,Uninspired & Uninteresting,"I have enjoyed many documentaries on the Christian faith on various cable (A&E) and public television channels. However, this particular documentary was very disappointing. The documentary seems unorganized and doesn't provide any genuinely interesting insights. I regret purchasing this DVD."
4,A Good Introduction,"I think this video could have provided more detail but it is far better than most films. To be fair, there is little information other than the scant information form the New Testament and thus they had to infer about these persons. It is good that they gave the historical context for the Acts of the Apostles and the accepted Gospels and presented deeper meaning for the incidents in the Bible."
2,An empty husk.,"I started this DVD with high expectations but didn't get very far I'm afraid. Maybe I should have stuck it out. I imagine its target audience is the nonbeliever who doesn't know anything about Christianity but has a historical curiosity. The work is certainly put out by nonbelievers - skeptics who have trouble believing the Bible and at the same time are trying to explain the most pivotal event in the history of mankind, namely the entry of the Christ of God into time and space. When I saw the little heretic, Dominique Crossan, interviewed over and over again I knew I had a turkey on my hands. The story of Peter and Paul is a great story, but without the power of belief the film isn't half as uplifting, awesome, inspiring , joyous and powerful as it could have been."
5,College textbook,I used this book to write my thesis for a college course in Criminal Justice. I am happy with this purchase. It was informative and exciting. This book told me all that I needed to know about women in authority in law enforcement and how they effectively deal with some typical situations in their careers.
1,Deserves zero stars - cliché festival,"This is supposed to be ""Canada packaged for American audiences"", with curling as the main subject. Yes, it is what Ebert calls a CLIDVIC - ""Climb from Despair to Victory"" standard sports cliché, which is already bad enough... BUT it is also a romantic comedy, and a ""everyone has problems that require lots of soul-searching"" story, both of which miserably fail. To add insult to injury, its ending is even worse and more simplistic than a standard CLIDVIC ending.Considering all the good Canadian movies available right now (get your hands on ""L'Odyssée d'Alice Tremblay"" if you can), this is a totally worthless movie and its producers should be executed for treason."
4,That Curling Game,"I had never heard of this movie, until my sister gave it to me for Christmas. Huge Huge fan of Due South and the idea of a quirky, romantic comedy starring Paul Gross was something I would never turn down. I loved it, I am not Canadian and still don't really understand Curling, but that didn't hinder me from greatly enjoying this film."
1,Mildly entertaining rubbish really,"We're great fans of Paul Gross who stars in this film. This was supposed to be clever and tongue in cheek comedy, but was pretty rubbishy really. The humour was far beneath Paul's other works (Due South, and Slings and Arrows, for example). The film was entertaining enough, but tepid. We didn't even really feel like we'd learned much about curling particularly, either.. but then we're Canadian already so what more is there to know?! We enjoy and ""get"" Canadian humour but this was definitely the shallow end of it. If you buy the video as part of a combined postage deal, great; if not, give it a miss."
2,Men with Brooms,"If you love the sport of curling, do not watch this movie! The acting is just okay. Don't let your kids watch this movie as there is a lot of profanity in it. The movie isn't awful, but it isn't good either. The curling action is not realistic."
4,"Canadians will love this movie. Americans? OK, I guess so.","I am a fan of the great series ""Due South"" and its star Paul Gross. So, I snatched up this film when I discovered that Gross and regular ""Due South"" guest star Leslie Nielson starred in it.I liked it. I really did. Gross is likable, as is the rest of the cast. I always love Nielson, and he does well in this film.But I couldn't help thinking that I was missing out on a lot of the jokes. There was a lot of humor or references that I suspect that only Canadians would appreciate. Not that I didn't enjoy this film--I certainly did. It was sweet and quirky. And even though I had no clue about this game with brooms that they were playing, I grasped enough to root for them. But that feeling of, ""I'm think I'm missing something here"" was in the back of my mind a lot of the time.Oh well, I still recommend this film. Especially if you are a Paul Gross or Leslie Nielson fan."
4,Men with brooms rocks,"I just rented Men with Brooms, and I really liked it. I think that there is nothing that Paul Gross can do. Since his fun-filled days on Due South, Paul has demostrated a knack for the sublime and is able to turn it into watchable fodder. I may be an American, but a curling movie is not that hard to understand as long as it has a good plot and some really good acting.If you love Canadian and/or British humor, then this is the movie for you."
2,size was small,"Would rather the picutre be on the back and I ordered a large, usually plenty big enough for my husband, but seemed more like a medium.Order size larger than you wear."
5,My favorite Pups release,"This is my favorite disc by a band with a fantastic musical dynamic that draws on such a wide influence of styles. This disc has a pretty strong country flavor, the playing is swell, most of the songs are good ones. I really like this period of their work, but my main attraction to this band is that each album is unique in style, yet so absolutely Meat Puppets! Curt Kirkwood's guitar work is bitchen, as always!"
3,Dissapointing,"After getting the excellent ""Up on the Sun"" and ""Meat Puppets 2"" albums, I had high anticipations for ""Mirage"", but I was very dissapointed. The album is very polished but lacks in energy and the songs are weak, and do not fit Curt K.'s vocal style. You're better off buying the previous two albums."
5,Very revealing tale of conservative politics at their worst!,"""Capitol Games"" is a very revealing book that takes the reader behind the scenes in one of the most controversial Supreme Court appointments in this country's history. Phelps and Winternitz have written a well-researched tale of how Thomas was picked by the Bush White House over several more qualified candidates to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall on the Court. If you ascribe to the principle that only the best and the brightest should be appointed to the Court without regard to race or ideology, you will be surprised or, as I was, angered. Although this title is out of print, I strongly recommend finding and reading it to find the truth behind what amounts to little more than blatant manipulation of the appointment process (I will admit to having some bias in writing this review, by the way)."
5,A Guide to Cinderella,"This is an excellent collection of articles on the fairytale Cinderella. My particular favorite is Dundes' own article on the origins of the story we've come to know as King Lear in one of the early Cinderella variants. For anyone interested in the history and criticism of fairytales, this is an excellent book with many different view points on various versions of Cinderella."
5,Trumpet Kings,"This video is a must for jazz trumpeters and historians. It covers the history of jazz from a trumpet perspective. It includes live performance clips and still photos of the great jazz trumpet innovators like Satchmo, Roy, Dizzy, and Miles. Also includes information on other trumpet greats like ""Red"" Allen Bix, Bunny, Clfford, Lee, and many others. Informatively narrated by Wynton Marsalis. The video concludes with a performance by The Wynton Marsalis Quartet. I enjoyed this video because this was my first opportunity to see many of my favorite trumpeters in actual performance."
5,Trumpet Kings #1,"I hope they re-release this on DVD or VHS as soon as possible 'cuz it's been out-of-prints for days, or I'ma say years as for example. As to say this is very essential to those that like trumpet pioneers or trumpet kings I'll say who are in the looks of who's the best out there in jazz history: For example, Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Fats Navarro, Harry James, Chet Baker, Bunny Berigan, Art Farmer, Donald Byrd, etc.I actually seen several times on BET on Jazz and I didn't know it's was on VHS be4 it came on TV. Maybe 'cuz I'm specially a trumpet player who is learning to play jazz professionally like I did in the jazz band @ high school. A must."
2,this isn't music it's a documentary of sean paul's life,this cd tells all about the beginnings of the great artist Sean Paul and of the many artists who influenced him to be a dj. the people speaking have a british accent and it's a little odd but the cd is very informative if you want to do a biograpy or would like to know more about Saean Paul.
3,Decent...,"I use this item all the time, but I have found that it is hard to get it to stay on your arm. For instance, I tried to tighten it once and it became undone and slipped right down my arm. I found that this is due to the strap not really having something to hold itself in place. It's just looped around a plastic piece and you use velcro to tighten/loosen it. I don't know if that makes sense at all, but it is worth note. I just placed an office clip on the strap to stop it from sliding back in itself. Otherwise it's a good idea."
3,Belkin Sports Jacket Case,"This Jacket is flimsy, but it works. I have had it for a few years and it is still holing together. Good for gym not too great for running."
3,Only okay,"Holds Zune securely, but flops on arm during workouts, and it leaves the screen is exposed. Also, the band pinches your arm."
3,It's decent depending on what you use it for.,"I ordered this case without expecting much, seeing as i haven't cared for sylicone cases much before. The case does leave availability to all ports and buttons, however, for full protection you will need to invest in some screen covers too. This case leaves the screen wide open for injury. Also, if you plan on doing anything physical with this case, be careful. The armband slips right into the sylicone jacket making this a not very sturdy hold. If you will be moving around a lot, (like jogging) this case will allow your player to flop around quite a bit. All and all it is a decent case to store your zune in for minor bangs and scrapes and scratches... But that is pretty much all it is for."
5,"This is an amazing, exciting book for kids.",It is a shame books like this are no longer in print. Septimus Bean and His Amazing Machine is a truly excellent childrens book. The story is written in poetic narrative with tons of onomatopoeia and rhythmic imagery. The illustations capture the memorable moments with a vividness like water colors. I had this book memorized by the time I was 4 years old. To me it is a classic.
5,I still remember!,"This book was so amazing, exciting, and impactful for me as a young child that I still remember it today! I'm heading off to college and was recalling favourite memories of my childhood -- this book is one of them. Although the title had slipped my mind, I remembered the plot and the great illustrations.The title is comical, and as I recall, the events in the book were as well -- it was light-hearted and fun, but you also had a sense of satisfaction after finishing the story: a pleasant story that parents can enjoy reading to their children.It's too bad this book is no longer in print; it's really a treasure! :-)"
1,wrong advertised title of book,"this review is for amazon, the product you get here is ""Blood and Steel"", it is not ""The Path of The Warrior ""as the title says, for the ""Path of the warrior"" go to:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193065247X/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details"
1,Lame videos,"Pink has no taste when it comes to good music videos. First off There you go, the video doesn't make sense because that is clearly a hardcore RnB song but the video has her skating around. Since when do you see skaters in the hood?. Come on Pink. And plus she looks so pale I wonder if she's related to Powder. Joke. Most girls is less horrible, but the dancing is not smooth and you can tell she isn't in the same skill as Britney or Mya's dancing. Both of these videos show Pink as some really frustrated psychotic girl with mental problems, which I don't like at all. She isn't even rap music, so why act so tough?? Pink just doesn't know what is cool."
2,The Economic Way of Thinking,"My teacher recommended to purchase this book. He said that the concepts in the book are clearly explained. As a student who never took Economic, it is a little bit hard to understand some topics sometimes."
1,"Nice effort, but falls way short.","I was reading the reviews for this book, both 11th edition and 10th edition, and was surprised to be the only reviewer that disagrees with the quality of this book. The authors tried to teach Economics in a totally different way, no graphs, no tables, no data, etc. and failed miserably.The fact that there aren't any graphs, pie charts, etc. makes it hard to follow especially if you're more a visual person. It has a hokey ""down home"" feel to it that doesn't connect, except in a geeky-dork way. And the book is disorganized in terms of the material covered.In short, the book is written like a novel or a story, NOT as a textbook. If you enjoyed ""The Worldly Philosophers"" by Robert Heilbronner, you'll like reading this book. But to use it as an Economics textbook, BIG MISTAKE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST TEXTBOOKS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY COLLEGE SUBJECT OUT THERE.I give it an F or 1 out of 5."
3,NO INDEPENDANT STUDY'S HERE,"This book has considerable information for advanced studies, but is lacking more down to earth presentation. It needs more simplified terminology.This is not a book for a first year colledge student."
5,Must Be a Great Book,I haven't read this book although it's on my wish list (waiting for a lower cost). I have the fourth edition and it's an amazing publication thanks to the extrodinary knowledge of the author. I rated this unread book a 5 star because I believe it has to be a fantastic writing and I'll be gald when I can purchase it.
1,Bad Experience,"According to the description, this book should be a hard-cover one. However when I received it, it was a soft-cover one.The seller explain that ""The content are the same"".And never reply my mail again.Bad experience ever in Amazon."
3,Reference for Electrical PE Exam,"I purchased this book after receiving recommendations for it to use as a reference on the PE Electrical exam (Power Depth). The recommendations have come due to the lack of depth in the EERM. I've been working through this text for a while now, and I am not finding it very helpful as a review or reference for the PE. I've seen other texts that do a better job explaining motors, generators, transmission lines, etc. Overall though it is a decent text."
2,Basics only,It treats only the basics of electrical machines and it is very outdated. I would recommend it instead:Electric Machinery Fundamentals
2,There are better books out there.,"I have to say that I am not very impressed with Ms. Singer's first foray into bookwriting. I looked the book over because I like her Web site, Knitty, but this book disappointed me.First of all, the instruction sections are not as clear as they could be. The pictures should be bigger and there should be more written instruction. Besides, as the editorial review above states, it sounds like she's trying to imitate SnB. That's never a good way to go about writing a book, even though it is the sincerest form of flattery.Secondly, the patterns were very, very disappointing. Most of the patterns not available for free on her Web site are extremely basic. I am glad I only looked this book over in the store--had I bought it without looking at it, the patterns would have been a huge disappointment since half of them are available for free and the other half aren't very good. :/"
2,Disappointing,"My knitting skill rates somewhere between beginner and intermediate level, however I found this book's knitting instructions too vague for me to follow.It would've been very helpful if the good people at [...]had bothered to include the required ply for each pattern. The 'how to' section in the beginning of the book skims over ply and other details but really doesn't tell you how to do much of anything. It was also disappointing to find all of the patterns in the book are available to download from their site. My copy of this book is going straight onto eBay! Meanwhile, do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on Debbie Stoller's Bitch Nation books. They are packed with valuable information, the patterns are easy to follow and the garments are so much nicer."
4,"Fun, but sometimes too Funky","There are a lot of great projects in this book for knitters of all skill levels. There are some I truly love, like fuzzy feet and the pixie hat. Then there are some that are a bit scary, like the Freak Vest and the Jelly Belt. I like the information it provides for new knitters. She goes into good, but not excruciating, detail on differences in yarns, needles, and other important tools, as well as instruction on how to knit. It is written in a friendly, easy-going manner that is probably very helpful for nervous beginners, while not seeming like it is dumbed down and too simple for those with experience. It is a pretty good book, even if some of the projects are a bit scary."
3,Check out Knitty.com before you buy,The tutorial in the beginning of the book is excellent. The stand-up style of the book is very convienant for hands free follow along knitting. The patterns in the book are creative and cute. Most of them are also available online FREE at [...]I wish I had known that before I purchased the book. It would make a cute gift for a beginner. Overall I didn't find the book a treasury of patterns. It just condensed some of the cuter ones from the website. It is ok.
4,Got me back into knitting,"Has quite a few good patterns with things I might actually wear or use, which got me back into knitting. Clear explanations, good patterns. Like most knitting books, it serves as a good jumping off point to do your own thing.The design of the book, however, is an enormous pain in the posterior. It's bound on top with a nifty construction on the bottom that allows it to stand upright (handy), but once you flip a page you have to flip the book around to continue with the same pattern. This is silliness."
4,"At last, a knitting book that makes me smile","I teach knitting and have prayed for this kind of book, both to inspire beginners and people returning to the craft after a break. It's probably not fair to compare it to a 'cult' style publication, and certainly the illustrations are to me much better. They are fun, clear and inspiring. PS - I have have no connection at all with the author, but I look forward to a sequel!Anna."
3,Nice knitting book,"This book has a variety of projects, has helpful knitting instructions and information for a new knitter and the text is laid out very well with directions that are easy to follow. The book also has sort of an easle type back so it stands up while you're knitting - something I thought was clever and useful. My favorite project in the book was the water bottle sling."
3,Not for Beginners,"This is a good book--the projects are great, hip, and interesting, and they make you really want to get to work. But one problem was that in one of the first projects, an 'easy beginner's' project (the nosewarmer), the whole project depends on the knitter's knowledge of Wrap-and-Turn, or Short Rows. Beginners will not have this knowledge, especially not if the information in the ""basics"" section is new to them. In addition, nowhere in the book is there an explanation of Wrap-and-Turn, and only after consulting three other how-to books and the internet was I able to get a grasp of what that meant. To do this to a beginner can be quite discouraging. And it's too bad, because the book is overall very good, and the knitty.com site is great."
2,"Try this book if you are a young, intermediate experienced..","I agree with a lot of other reviewers who say tat this book is a mixed bag. As a crocheter trying to teach myself to knit, I bought this book. The format and the patterns really attracted me.With some difficulty I am now knitting; crochet experience helped a lot. However, in hindsight, I'd like a bookwith more technique, how exactly do you hold the needles? Some of the patterns say they are easy, but as much as I like them, I am going to need much more experience before I attempt them. The patterns are not written with very easy to follow instructions.Try this book if you are a young, intermediate experienced knitter. Otherwise, try another one."
3,"good patterns, despite poor quality & quantity of photos","The patterns are good (regardless of whether they are free or not), but my complaint is the quality of the photos - or rather, lack thereof. For example, check out the pixie hat on the back cover. That photo is the only one you get in the whole book. Ho-hum, boring, boring... but then you come across a picture of the finished object on someone's blog, and you realize that the hat is fabulous, especially from the side. However, had I not seen someone else's photo of this hat, I would not have bothered taking a second look at this book.(...)"
5,A GREAT book if you like fun projects!,"I got this book and at the same time, my sister in Oregon bought it for herself! There are some really neat projects in there, like a guy's sweater I made for my brother (my very first sweater!) and an ice cream pint cozy (I love Ben & Jerry's) and I'm going to make a laptop cover for my computer. The Pixie hat is on my list, as well. I made the Coif from the book and it turned out really nice and wasn't very difficult at all!"
2,Not worth the money,"Don't even bother to purchase this book! I went through & counted how many of the EXACT patterns you can get for free online & it is 16!! I don't think it is ethical to put together a compilation of patterns that you can get for free (anyone with a computer can) and sell it as a ""NEW"" book. Just my opinion. Borrow it, but don't buy it!"
1,"Just go to knitty.com, don't waste your money","I was eagerly awaiting Amy Singer's book b/c I am, as a lot of other reviewers have commented, a big fan of knitty.com. I was highly disappointed to see that all this book is a a collection of those same patterns that are currently available for free. While there are some new patterns that aren't on the website, they are nothing new and nothing that couldn't be found in a more original book elsewhere. That being said, I returned the book. I did feel a twinge of guilt about it b/c I really wanted to support Amy Singer. But, why should I pay for something when I can get it for free?"
2,really used,The MP-3 player was really used. The lock slide switch was not present. Sometimes the songs on the SD cards would stick.
2,Less Than Stellar,"A recent purchase of this product left my head spinning! For days now I've been attempting to get music to the MP3 player from the web downloaded MusicMatch Jukebox, but without success. The software that accompanied the player is missing critical components, such as any usable plug-in. When attempts to retrieve the plug-in from ANY web site, it's nowhere to be found. Neither MusicMatch nor Windows Media Player can even find the MP3 player at all! Obviously, this is an old player in terms of the electronics industry. The Users Manual leaves something to be desired as well. With letterhead only an ant can read and the fact that it repeats completed installation steps only leaves one wondering if a step was missed. On the brighter side, the sound quality is up there with the best. Overall, if you don't mind premature baldness, get the player. Otherwise, forget it and move on...."
1,Does not work with low-bitrate mp3 files,"I have quite a few mp3s of spoken recordings done in mono, 24kbs,which is fully adequate for this purpose.The manual it says that only bitrates 32 to 320kbps are supported.24kbps recordings sound like chipmunks.Sadly, I had to return the unit.It would have been nice if their had been mention of thislimitation on the package."
2,Ok MP3 Player,This player worked perfectly for one year. After that it just broke for no good reason at all.
5,rca lyra mp3,I downloaded to the mp3 player tonight and was very impressed at the ease of use. The player sounded great! I'd buy it again. Matter of fact I did. I have two of them now!
4,Life Expectancy has some issues,"I bought this handy little gadget for a trip out of country in October 2005 -- I needed something to run on batteries. The Lyra did the trick and I've been very happy with it.Until now.It has taken to eating batteries at a rapid pace and now takes several attempts to get it to turn on and off again (by taking the batteries out and putting them back in). Granted, I played the little dear to death... but I would have liked at least a year of life. October to March isn't quite what I hoped for.Would I buy this device again? Yes, of course. Now that I know its life expectancy. It's just too darn handy not to do without!As an aside, I never had problems sending information -- music or otherwise -- to the device. It transports everything I ask it, even if it can't 'play' the non .wav files. I don't use MusicMatch either, and just use the Windows file transfer system."
2,Below average.,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad mp3 player, but the shortcomings of it are unacceptable. My wife and I both have the 128 meg version of it and on both players the same problems arise.The most annoying is the fact that when you add extra memory, the player has a tendency to freeze up on you. You have to pull the battery out and reset it that way. That happens far too frequently.I suppose it's good for a budget mp3 player, but don't expect anything significant out of it."
5,Fun and Durable,"My son just received this for his 4th birthday. He has no problem fitting the pieces together, so it is probably best suited for a child at least 3 1/2 years old. He will sit and play with it for hours. My only complaint is that the boulder launcher does not knock the tower down--you have to hit the X button or knock it down manually. He also has the I-Fell Tower and loves that one too. Everything is very sturdy and well-made. I would definitely recommend this toy for other children of his age group."
2,Overpriced,I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old son and I regret spending the $20 on it. There are grooves on the columns that makes it too difficult for a young child to build it themselves. Then the only thing they do with it is press a button and watch it fall down. Don't waste your money. The only positve thing is that it is very durable.
2,Not as scented as I'd like,I had hoped that this would be a nice light citrus scent but it just isn't scented enough and it doesn't last on the skin at all. It may just be my body chemistry.
5,golf clubs grips,I am very happy with the grips and got them in just a few days.Great quality easy to replace.
4,New Tech,Have been mixed up in golf club repair since wooden headed drivers.these grips have a great feel for the money nice supprise prompt shippment as well.
2,This was a 2 man job,"Getting the grips on the shafts was quite a struggle. Finally needed some assistance. One guy to push the grip, one guy to pull it onto the shaft. Perhaps we were using the wrong solvent. In any case, it was less than a satisfactory experience."
1,Disappointed! Bad combo of 3 books for readers of different ages.,"The book itself is attractive with bright photographs, and there ends the positives. It is a mis-mash of 3 books for readers of different ages. It is overcomplicated for young readers (e.g. do adults know what egrets and kookaburras are, can you tell gosling and duckling apart). The pictures are unclear (e.g the turkey and rooster only have close-ups of the head, which makes them look pretty alike). The worst is the Dinosaur book, which is inappropriate for kids under 7-8 years (who I suspect wont need to learn school bus and cat from picture books). Full 10 pages are devotes to dinosaurs. The names are unpronouncable (Xenotarsosaurus, Stenonychosaurus), and the pictures are menacing and scary. A waste of money (the list price is quite high)."
5,Great Product,"There is only so much one can write about a griddle, but for the price, this product is excellent and works well. Highly recommended."
2,uneven Surface temperature,"I bought this grill based on customer reviews, but mine heated very unevenly. With the temperature control set to 250 FWith a non contact infrared thermometer I checked 4 spots.Here are the results. #1-335F #2-349F #3-284F #4-298FThank goodness for amazons return policy. I returned the Presto and bought a Broil King PCG-10I have it two stars because its a nice looking griddle with a drain pan"
3,Works but needs improvements,"Personally, don't like the fact that it is tilted. Eggs, oil, and other things run to the front and down into the grease slot. Biggest disappointment is that the removable grease drawer upper sides bow inward so the drawer falls down! I had to make an expandable wedge to insert in the drawer to hold the sides straight. The ends of the cooking surface get hotter than the center. Have used for over 2 years but will replace with a different model."
4,Sure buy,Excited with this griddle....turned out exactly what I had expected. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for indoor/outdoor quick fry/grill
1,Too BIG,"this griddle works fine but there is NOWHERE to store it - too long to fit in a standard kitchen cabinet... I end up storing it on top of the fridge where it gathers dust... Therefore I don't really use it that much. A good use for it, though, is on the lowest setting it makes for a great appetizer warmer plate at a party!"
2,Uneven heat and not hot enough,"Decent for flapjacks, but they cook much quicker on the right near the power connector.Doesn't maintain high temp for serious browning though."
5,Terrific griddle!,This is the first griddle I've purchased and it's great! You can cook a lot on this one.
4,Good Cd,"I really thought this cd was descent, the screaming seems to be only 1 or 2 tones but the signing is perfect, not enough to be called a punk band but there was enough to keep it away from the death metal genre. This is definetly one of the better metalcore bands.Another thing is who the fcuk lets these tard reviewers post threads here? I mean seriously the kid who wrote the review below me is a total dumbass. I agree that it is a good cd but where would these guys be without shadows fall or killswitch engage? No one would have even heard of ""Diecast"" without looking at a killswitch or SF cd. Its unbelieveable what BS is posted here sometimes, dising the gods of metalcore for a GOOD but much lesser band. (Nothing against Diecast just some people piss me off, O and go ahead and rag on Bleeding threw all you want F*ing screamo band all should be shot) DONT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY JUST GETTING THE POINT THREW!"
4,"Not exactly a masterpiece, but...","ok, first of all, this is in no way revolutionary, or origional, or a masterpiece. It is simply a good metal album, nothing more. Personally i liked the album, being a fan of the thrash scene, it's nice to see diecast bring a bit of the old 80's thrash and update it, it makes an awesome song. You won't like this if you dont like metal, but i'm assuming if you're here you like metal. I'm not an expert, i'm 15, i listen to a ton of music new and old, from Tool, to The Rolling Stones, to Weezer, to Slayer. So i'm all over the place musically, and this cd just happens to be one of my favourites at the moment, and is getting pretty heavy rotation in my cd. Like other reviewers said, this is not LoG, or Shadows Fall. Both of those bands are awesome, but dont expect anything like either of them on here. Rise and Oppose and Fire Damage were the best tracks in my opinion, but it's all pretty good."
3,Not too shabby...,"But, They really arent doing anything new; Its a pretty standard metalcore album... Good Songs, but I dont think it has staying power. Ever since Killswitch Engage - Alive or Just Breathing? (which is the blueprint, and probably THE best example of metalcore), Many, Many bands have tried to duplicate the sound. And, in truth, these guys are pretty close.... but nonetheless, would benefit by carving out their own identity instead of sticking with the formula.Songs such as ""Savior"", ""Traitor"", and ""Fire/Damage"" are standout tracks, though."
3,SS Grill For My Tahoe,"The Stainless Steel seems to be of Good Quality, The Grill Installed Easy, and The Polished Finish Was Nice.My Only Complaint Was The Diamond Cut Outs Seemed Cut A Bit Rough Makeing This Purchase A Little Disappointing To Me. But Iam Certain No Birds, Bugs, ect.. Will Ever Break It."
2,skip this!,"This is a really bad movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the beauty pageant thing can be quite funny, but this film is taking an otherwise funny topic and not doing enough with it. Minnie Driver is MUCH more charming and likeable in Return to Me."
4,Better than I Expected,"I thought this movie was adorable! I loved the way it started out with Minnie Driver's character as a child- the endless amount of energy (and make-up and money!) the little girl put into her pageant efforts was hilarious!The ""Miss America Miss"" pageant contestants were classic- it makes you realize just how ridiculous those things are!Yes, it was cheesy and overly dramatic, definitely unrealistic, but it was clearly intended to be this way. This satire was also very sweet with the very young Hallie Kate stealing the show!"
3,a good movie to watch with your girlfriends,"This movie is funny, charming, and at times just plain cheesey - the perfect movie for a girls' night out! I think the funniest part of the movie was when little Mona couldn't eat an orange because she was on a diet.. A good movie overall, worth buying as long as it's a good price!!"
1,Great cast and director.....DISASTER of a movie!,"Wonderful cast and excellent directo.....I am a fan of all! But, for directoral debut, come on Sally, you could have done a lot better. Sally is one of the best in show biz, wealth of experience.....such a disappointing start in the director world. Starts out as a cute, feel good story....then, goes down hill. Pathetic story twist and a stretch at making a very well intended message. Avoid this movie!"
1,Horrid,"I unfortunately had to sit through this in the theatre, and it was one of the worst films I saw last year. The Pepsi Girl does what she can, but Driver is annoying and Joey Lawrence Adams is wasted here. ""Miss Congeniality"" covers similair material in a much more likeable fashion. This film is mean, stereotyped and not worth your time."
3,Beautiful is Ugly,"I have faithfully watched Ms. America since I was knee high to a grasshopper, in hopes that one day I could wear the crown. (Maybe, just maybe.) But Beautiful, though written in fiction, is very cold. It makes beauty contestants look like airheads, and people who are totally self centered. Maybe some winners out there are like that. But all in all, Beautiful makes pageants look bad. Minnie Driver plays a lady who has wanted to win Ms. America since she was little, and will do anything to get the tiara. She even would lie about having a her illegitamite baby, just so she could win. The movie ends rather predictably. I enjoyed the movie, because it was so, well, darkly funny, and of course, involved pageants. And yes, it tries to tie some family values in at the end. I'm starting to ramble, I better stop. To put it plainly: Watch it. Laugh a little. Just don't come yelling at me when you get sick to your stomach."
1,The movie is bad,"I thought with Minnie Driver in this movie it would be good. It's not. The plot is shallow, the acting is okay - the actors just don't have much to work with. Stopped watching it halfway through and sent the DVD out the door."
5,Great ALL AROUND,I am completely satisfied with my order. I love the movie BEAUTIFUL and couldn't find it anywhere! You guys had great customer service and fast shipping and handling! I am a very happy girl when my packages arrive as should!
5,love it,i love this movie i usto watch it when i was younger and i recently was trying to figure out what this movie was called and than i seen it on tv and watched it and it was the movie!! i recoded it on my dvr untill i can buy it!!
4,A Wonderful Look At One Woman's Quest for Success,"A very good film. Minnie Driver had no one to help her succeed in attaining her goals. It is so refreshing to see such a well-rounded and determined female character in movies today. She did want she wanted to do, and didn't ask for help."
5,a gift,bought this as a gift for someone who has always been in love with old England! She enjoyed the book.
5,Terrific Read,"I read this book in its entirety the day I received it in the mail. It is an incredible story, one that is told in a riveting narrative. I absolutely could not believe the lengths to which this oil company went to deny, delay, and stonewall the efforts of so many different people and organizations to hold them responsible for an underground oil spill they had undeniably caused. This book was an eye-opener. If you care about the environment, about energy, or about the law, read this book. I hope someone makes a movie out of this thing; it is such a great story."
3,A Weaker Novel of the Childe Cycle,"Gordon R. Dickson's 'The Final Encyclopedia' is easily one of the greatest novels of science-fiction. The novels that precede it in the series are also all first rate works. But sadly, the three novels that follow, 'Young Bleys,' 'Other,' and 'The Chantry Guild,' are considerably weaker. While 'The Chantry Guild' does give some reward to the readers who've followed the series for years, it still lacks the final resolution that we've waited for, (no doubt Dickson is planning more books in the series), and the bulk of the work is just plain uninteresting. If you're a fan of the series then you probably should give this one a look, if you're new to the Childe Cycle you might want to start with 'Tactics of Mistake,' of 'Soldier, Ask Not.'"
3,Super Reader,"The sixth book in the Childe Cycle is fairly philosophical. Hal Mayne visits the Chantry Guild, in its incarnation in this time. He spends a lot of time with them on the planet Kultis still trying to understand and spearhead the final transformation of humankind.As before, he is sometimes opposed by those that want to stop him, Bleys specifically."
5,A gem of practicality,"Few books offer so many practical rewards for lawyers (indeed for anyone who uses Acrobat). Cleanly written and full of screenshots to aid you, this is a one stop shop for ""everything Acrobat"" a lawyer could possibly want to know. David Masters is renowned as a lawyer/expert who speaks nationwide about the use of Adobe Acrobat in law firms. If you get the chance to hear him speak, you'll thoroughly enjoy him in person, but the book is a reference tool that you'll go back to time and again. Most lawyers who read this book are shocked by the many things that Acrobat can do - and they practice better, more efficiently and more securely as a result. This book should be in every lawyer's library."
5,Really Great,"This book really walked me through using Acrobat Professional.I'm know computer wizard, and this book has been really useful to me."
5,The ESSENTIAL Guide,"If you're a Clive Cussler fan, this should be your Holy Book.Wayne Valero is a champion of his craft. The amount of effort and dedication he put into this work boggles the mind. It is, quite simply, the most detailed -- entertaining and even scholary -- approach to Cussler's work. EVERY single edition has been meticulously documented and served in a mouth-watering dressing of accompanying facts and notes.The bibliography delivers everything you might expect -- and then some. Wayne Valero provides a running commentary on various Cussler-related topics -- from the Grandmaster's trademark style that impacted the genre, to insight on the Raise the Titanic movie script.This 376-page book is crammed with value.Savor it."
2,we were going along fine...,"Escaflowne is a great series. It's wonderfully animated, has an epic plot, well developed characters, and plenty of backstories. But this particular tape was pretty disappoiting. When they finally met Emperor Donkirk it was very anti-climatic. I suppose you should expect that from anime, though. And it seems like as the series progresses the romance gets more heavy-handed and physic power thing gets more ridiculous. I haven't even bothered watching any tapes after this one, but I hope it gets better again."
2,"5 Stars for Content, 0 Stars for Format Problems!","There's not much to be said about the Escaflowne series that hasn't already been said - but a warning must go out to all Playstation 2 owners who use their machines as their exclusive DVD players... ESCAFLOWNE - PARADISE & PAIN (Vol. 5) and ESCAFLOWNE - FATE & FORTUNE (Vol. 6) are NOT PS2 compatible! This problem has been verified with DVDs purchased from multiple sources, on multiple machines - the fault lies not with Amazon, but with Bandai.Let me reiterate - Vols 5 and 6 of Escaflowne are NOT PS2 compatible discs! Why this is so, I don't understand, as ALL of the *other* discs in this series *are* PS2 compatible. Other than this inexplicable and irritating problem, this series is of the highest quality, with excellent picture and Dolby Digital sound to boot."
3,not the band I expected,"gave this 3 stars, ulthough I was greatly dissapointed when I recieved this cd. If you are wanting THE SWORD band that released AGE of WINTERS, then skip by this one, this is actually a defunct canadian band that sounds in no way like the sword I was expecting. So I was gonna give no stars but decided that If this is the band you were wanting, then it would be a good purchace, decent recording and a lot of songs"
5,Works Great!,"I bought this riveter to install an exhaust heat shield on my car's rear bumper. I tried this riveter out and it worked great. In the end, I decided not to install the heat shield, but am looking forward to other projects where I can use this tool."
1,Doesn't eject stem,"I put one rivet in and used it. It would not eject the stem. The directions say it ejects the stem automatically. I could not get the stem out even with pliers. I returned it and got a new one, same problem. Got a refund."
4,One Night Stand,"Punk had transitioned to post-punk in the mid 80's when this gem appeared from out of nowhere. Well not nowhere, but LA, the home of THE premier indie label of the time, SST. I put this disk on for the first time expecting hard core. What I got was somewhere between punk, garage and rock. Falling James and company sound a lot closer to the Ramones and the Replacments in spirit, both musically and otherwise. You can feel the scars, smell the sweat and alcohol, and feel the motion.The album is like it's name: It feels goods, sounds good, is sloppy; and like most times, is way too short. With the exception of the long afterglow (What The President Meant To Say), this is a fun wild ride with a good climax, meant to be repeated as often as possible for your pleasure. Add in ""Drunken Version Of You"" and this would be a classic debut."
2,Irritate Your Parents,"Well, if the title of this album doesn't put you off, then the music will. I bought this when it came out because I wanted to take a dare. I have since sold it back, years ago. Good stuff if you want to drive everyone out of the house."
5,Ace Frehley Strings,"Quick Shipment, arrived in great condition. Excellent product for the price. If you can't afford the guitar this is the next best thing."
3,There Are Better Strings Out There...,"I, as I'm quite sure many of you are, am a huge fan of the Spaceman. So, when finding out that GIBSON was producing Aces' signature gauge strings, I decided to give them a try. First thing I noticed (after stringing them up on my Les Paul) was their tone, of course. Very bright. Extremely bright. Not a bad thing. But, for me anyway, my D'addario 9-42 Super Lights have a better feel. More depth. A nicer, smoother feel on my fingers in general. Very easy to bend and manipulate notes. These Gibson's are not bad...Just not very well suited for every player. Don't buy these just because Frehley's picture is on the box."
5,Attacks business issues head on,"Berger, in his typical style, attacks the issues head on. He cuts through the nonsense and identifies the fundamentals that organizations must address from within in order to get on a growth curve. His concise thinking is reflected in the roadmap for change that is laid out, and the mini case studies provide excellent examples of how real life companies have successfully applied the principles that Berger outlines in the first half of the book."
1,Odd background flavor,"The texture is fine but this has a very odd background flavor to it. I've tried to place it and think it might be from the coconut but I'm just not sure. Though I enjoyed this brand's Oatmeal Raisin granola, I would never buy this flavor again."
2,Crumbly,"The granola was too crumbly. I assumed that granola should be more stuck together (more chunky). Instead of eating on its own, I had to use the crumbs for cereal. Taste was average. I was rather disappointed. I would not buy this product again."
1,moldy taste,"I thought this product tasted musty or moldy and would not recommend. As if it had sat in a warehouse too long. I'm a granola fan and I LOVE the Erin Baker cookies, but this granola didn't cut it."
3,Too soft,"The flavor is good, but this fruit and nut combo is soft and chewy. I prefer crunchy granola"
3,Tasty Granola,"It is somewhat hard to chew, but after several minutes in yogurt it was great and filling."
2,Don't read Angela's Ashes first.,"After reading Angela's Ashes and Dublin Girl, I craved more gritty Irish memoirs. Unfortunately this seemed disjointed and self-indulgent to me. Many of the author's trials seemed self-inflicted, in contrast to the poverty and family tribulations exposed by the other writers."
5,These are perfect!!!!,I bought two pairs...black patent and brown patent. I gets compliments every time I wear them and they are COMFORTABLE!!! I could not love them more. These shoes made me a bigger Charles David fan.
2,Charles David Heels,The shoes look great but the quality is terrible. I purchased these heels wore them once and the leather around the heel was peeling and the sole of the shoe was poor.
5,Note by note,Beautifully done film. I greatly enjoyed it. It goes into detail about how hard it is to produce such beautiful works of art and how each one is unique in the end. Great film.
2,Boring,"Somewhat interesting...I like that concertizing pianists were interviewed and how they shared what they look for in a piano. Otherwise, the behind the scenes look at the workers and whatnot is very boring. I wanted to know the history of the Steinway family and how the pianos were first made with such fine precision. Not enough history for me."
4,Not A Bad Debut,"This record is more nostalgic then anything, but that being said it sets the tone of the other early albums. Punk and Psychedelic tones mix throughout the album and although Mark's voice would undeniably improve, it still is fun to listen to what he was like at 18 years of age. Barriers and The turning are the definite high points for me, but they only got better from here."
5,DIVA style,"Whitney and George Michael are two of my best performers. I enjoy the DVD and I bought it three years ago and still could not stop watching it. BTW, FINE is just fine"
5,CLIC READING GLASSES,ABSOULTLY SATIFIED WITH PRODUCT THEY ARE ALWAYS AT HAND NO SEARCHING FOR MY GLASSES ANY MORE THEY ARE COMFORTLY HANGING AROUND MY NECK AND EASY TO PUT IN PLACE. I WOULD RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE WITH AN ACTIVE JOB AND NEEDED FOR READING OR CLOSE WORK.
2,OKAY - Do not fit everyone. Need to return.,"I ordered these for my dad because my boss had a pair and I thought them very neat and a cool idea. My dad constantly buys the packages of 5 or 6 reading glasses because he breaks or looses them all the time. What I did not factor in or realize after purchasing them, wrapping them for Christmas and once given to my dad they didn't fit because his head is too big. Even on the loosest setting. What do you do!?Rebecca"
4,Attracts attention,"Everybody like the color and specially the front opening magnet. Good for ""youngs"" from 15 to 61 years (my husband is 61). Only difficulty is that you need both hands to handle it."
3,"Works ok, but very tight to my face.","I'd say I have an average size head. When I put these on, they pull up so close to my eye my eyelashes hit the glass. I don't remember if there was a ""size"" when I purchased these. But if you want a pair of these, I suggest buying them at a store so you can try them on."
3,Good for men,"I haven't got used to them yet. I'm the kind with a set of reading glassed pushed back on my head and they are forever falling off when I bend over. But they are easy to flip up and down. The CliCs are a little awkward and if you slide them up quickly your hair is lifted and sits over them in a goofy way. So if you don't want to look silly you have to fix your hair. They would work best for men or women with short hair or if you wear your hair in a ponytail. Not good for reading in bed as the band is behind your head. Get a chain or string to attach to your reading glasses to hang around your neck...faster, easier and much cheaper."
4,Clic adjustable readers,"They work great...only problem I have is that they are a little tight on my head, so they are tight. Otherwise great because I don't lose them like I did with most of my other readers."
4,Can't lose glasses,"These glasses are great especially if you're used to using a chain. My only criticism would be more or some flexibility in the frame &/or some extension capability on the sides. Otherwise, they are very satisfactory & user friendly."
2,glasses that give you hat hair,"The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head. Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you. Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet."
1,CliC Fit,"The CliC Adjustable Front Connect Readr, 3.00 Strenght, Tortoise Frame is a beautifully made artifact with the right strength. But it does not fit. I don't have a particularly big head, yet I can hardly get the thing around my head, let alone fit it on my nose and read comfortably."
4,advertising,"I love the glasses. I've had them in the past and needed a stronger strength. BUT, there is a permanent advertising of ""CLIC"" on the top of the left lens."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"I didn't expect the back part to be hard plastic like that.I thought it was that tubing like stethoscopes are made from, so I could roll it up small& carry it in the glovebox,or generally make it more portable.I think that would be a better concept.Other than that I like how thy're out of my way when they're on my neck for work or whatever.jim"
5,Adjustable and convenient,"I bought a pair for my father last year and he has used these so much that he asked for two more. Once he figured out how to adjust the length (pull the frames out to make them longer) he's had no complaints. They're convenient as he works his hands. The other pairs that hang on strings around the neck dangled in front of his work and got in the way, but these just slide around the neck when not in use, out of the way. Highly recommended."
5,exterr plug in harness,This harness allows you to add a trailer harness to your vehicle without complicated splicing and cutting. Simply plug the male end into the matching female socket on the vehicle harness and you are ready to tow in minutes!
5,"Power, Music, Electric Revival","Absolutely the best music video dvd I've bought. B.O.B. is the best rap video ever, up with there with ""It was a Good day"",""Natural Born Killaz"", ""Triumph"", and ""If you really wanna party with me"". This video is (...) incredible. It also has an interview and the ""Ms.Jackson"" video. I highly suggest you buy it."
1,delivery,"The US dealer of my purchase, friendsoftopekashawneecountry, delivers only in the USA. Fortunately I have relatives in the USA and the parcel arrived there in good condition. It was sent by US postal services to my address in Holland, from Baltimore MD to New York and from NY to Abu Dhabi!! I keep you posted as to it will ever arrive in Holland!Sincerely, Tijn Vellekoop, Gouda, Holland"
3,Madonna fans will love it. I'm not so sure about anyone else,"This is a movie from another universe! This movie is so bad that it's good, and it's actually a lot of fun for the Madonna fan because we get to see her try her hardest to be a combination of Marilyn Monroe from ""Some Like It Hot"" and a Lucille Ball from ""I Love Lucy"" (she even does the Lucy nasal voice at times). But she just can't pull it off, and that failure, combined with the myriad of other things wrong with this movie (the plot, for one), make this one of the worst movies ever made.Like I mention, though, it's so bad that it's good. This movie is sort of in the genre of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" Your jaw hits the floor at the thought that anyone would have even considered this movie had any chance to work. And, after a while, Madonna's performance even becomes endearing. This movie is destined to become a cult classic."
3,"We ain't talking Oscar here, but...","if you want a semi-mindless, screwball comedy that will almost make you wet yourself laughing...then this is the film for you. Madonna and Dunne are a great combo. Don't look for any meaningful, socially-redeeming value in this one...just sit back and laugh"
3,Who's That Girl- DVD,I love this movie but I have to watch DVD's on my playstation and it doesn't work..so I just have to wait untill I can buy myself a new DVD player.
4,Guilty Pleasure,I bought this DVD as a Christmas present to myself. It's a movie that I watched repeatedly as a young girl when I was obsessed with Madonna. I've grown up but (I had her in my cab once) I still love this movie. It's what it is and nothing more and that's what I like about it.
3,It Was Alright,"Being set in New York City, the events in the film were kind of unrealistic. But it's a comedy so I guess it doesn't matter. Madonna's acting wasn't that bad but her character Nikki Fin sure was annoying. And what was up with those eyebrows and those silly outfits? The only time Madonna looked halfway decent in the film was when she wore that white dress. Other than that the movie was somewhat cute and entertaining.The music was also good."
5,Madonna's best movie performance to date,I absolutely love this movie. Very cute and funny. Madonna played an awesome part and did a GREAT job. A++ in my book.
3,"Well, at least one scene was nice.","Monday, February 16, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Once upon a time, I actually liked Madonna's `Marilyn' era. Pappa Don't Preach and Open Your Heart showed her dancing around as a pale platinum goddess. This film came out around that time as evidenced by her transformation in the inner city wildlife sanctuary. I'm not sure if this film has crossed over into camp/cult status but it is often referred to as one of the worst films around. Foppish Lauden Trott is set to marry ex-16 Candles bombshell when he runs afoul of Madonna playing a framed convict with a whiney slash freaked out way about her. Hilarity apparently was supposed to ensue. It's a harmless movie that doesn't aspire to be anything more than it is. The cougars were beautiful though."
3,"A modern version of ""Bringing Up Baby"".","This movie is really hilarious. I thought it had a clever plot, and a perfect sense of screwball comedy. As I watched ""Who's That Girl"", I couldn't help but think of the Cary Grant-Katherine Hepburn film, ""Bringing Up Baby"". Both films had a big wild cat on the loose, and both showcased a female in love turning the life of the man she loves upside down. Madonna is no Hepburn, but offered a wonderful performance as the loud, boisterous Nikki Finn. My favorite scene was Madonna having to pose as Griffin Dunne's fiancee in order to get an apartment, and then the cougar shows up in front of the landlords to add to the confusion! I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the kidnapped bridesmaids who practically deafen their abductors by constantly screaming throughout the ordeal. The movie is a wonderful misadventure and just good fun."
5,Madonna is Hilarious (Intentionally!),This is a FUNNY FUNNY ( one more time ...FUNNY!) movie. Madonna as Nikki Finn was BRILLAINT casting. Don't listen to the jaded journalists who have pigeonholed M into only one medium of entertainment.(OK SO SHE HAS MADE SOME BAD MOVIES...BUT THIS ISNT ONE OF THEM) Griffin Dunne is great as M's sidekick in this fast paced comedy. Give it a chance.....its no dud!e n j o yCIAO MADONNA!
5,Totally Underrated and Misunderstood,"I've seen this movie so many times, and I just love it more every time I see it. I know it got really bad ratings from the critics, and also from a lot of people who have it set in their mind that Madonna is a bad actress. One thing about this movie that a lot of people don't realize is that it's not supposed to be deep and profound. It's to make you laugh, and Madonna accomplishes this EXTREMELY well. As long as you go into this movie knowing what to expect, you should like it, too."
2,Wow! Who's that Girl? !!!!!,"So yeah, the film, & the script has a lot of problems, but I don't understand why critics gave Madonna a bad review. She played this character like a pro. She was funny & sooooooooooooooooooo adorable! She made me want to be Nikki Finn.I think Madonna got on this path of bad films because somebody in the industry wanted her to fail as an actress......there's no reason for Madonna to be coined ""a bad actress"" because of this film......she was just as natural here as she was in Desperately Seeking Susan."
3,Where's That DVD???,"April 2003 and still no sign of it! I can't believe they released ""Body Of Evidence"" on DVD before this Madonna flick. Yeah, I know, not the greatest comedy of all time; but had it been released around 1939 it would have been a huge hit! It's just good, ole slap-stick humor that most people can no longer understand because current tastes have become a bit more ""sophisticated""........? Anyway, I hope we don't have to wait much longer for this......my VHS copy is long worn out.UPDATE: August 2005 and I ain't gettin' any younger here! And yes, they've done it again......released yet another stinker before WTG......""A Certain Sacrifice"". How much longer must we wait?"
2,Where's that girl?,"Ok, let me just start by saying that I am one of Madonna's most rabid fans...loved her in Evita, Dangerous Game (any of you seen that one?),Desperately Seeking Susan, and A League Of Their Own. The problem with this movie is not her acting, which is better than usual, but Madonna herself...she's as irritating as she has ever been with this shrill performance--channeling Judy Holiday on a really bad day--it's no Holiday and nothing to celebrate. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the writing is smart; Madonna single-handedly ruined what could have been great."
1,This Hagdonna movie was a MONSTER FLOP!,"Triple H(as Fed Up): Like Madonna is my hero! Shawn Michaels(as Hellraiser): This movie was so awesome. Triple H: Let's get some facts straight, this movie FLOPPED BIG TIME! Shawn Michaels: The dumbo played a typical loser Italian American convicted felon who steals a yuppie away. Triple H: Hagdonna only had one successful movie in the box office which was Evita. Shawn Michaels: The rest of her films all tanked and now her music career is dead! If you are not down with DX WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells ""S*CK IT"")"
2,Disappointed in the description,"Although I love this movie, no matter how terrible the acting and plot, the DVD was not as described. For the price, I won't complain too much, but I suggest a more accurate description on other products. I probably would not trust this sellers' idea of 'New'."
4,an unappreciated gem,Madonna's first attempt at a comedic role. She was successful! Surprised that this wasn't more popular than it was! She was perfect for the role of Nikki Finn! I wish she had done more movies like this one!
3,not bad...,"I give it the stars, only because it is the only English translation of the great Shaykh Al Alawi. The BIGGEST mistake of the book, and why oh why did they get away with it was when the story goes how Al Alawi was given the tariq. pg 68 says that he received the tariq in a dream. This is incorrect, and if it wasn't for that I would have given this book more stars! All in all, it was a nice read, there is a photo of him Rahimullah, Is it really him though?? Although it is a biography, at the end there are some of his wonderful poetry, and Mystical sayings to his murid's! That was the highlight of the book, oh and some nice brush ups on Islamic history of that time in the Maghrib area!"
5,Best way of eating for women ever!,"Best diet/way of eating for women after we get to ""that stage"". Plenty of good food and an immediate weight loss noticed.....with great compliments. This book has never gone out of style."
5,Jean Carn's two best PIR albums on 1 CD.,"These were Jean's 1979 and 1981 PIR albums and she gives some of her most beautiful and breathtaking performances on songs like ""Mystic Stranger"", ""Was That All It Was?"", ""Don't Say No To Love"", ""All I Really Need Is You"", ""Intro/ My Love Don't Come Easy"", ""Love Don't Love Nobody"" and ""When I Find You Love"". Incredibly, these two albums' sales figures and chart placings were very poor- they are, however, excellent albums. Like the late Phyllis Hyman and Angela Bofill, Jean Carne was too good a singer for mainstream record buyers and radio to appreciate."
5,my two favorite Jean Carn albums!,"Two for one and my two favorites! Love it, love it. Gamble and Huff were never better during these years and Jean got the benefit like so many other Philly Int. artists.."
5,This can opener rocks!,"After reading other reviews for this product, I decided to purchase the can opener. Am I glad I did! This can opener is the smoothest, easiest to clean can opener I've ever owned. Well worth the price, and better than many of the higher priced can openers I've seen. I would purchase another one of these without a moment's hesitation."
2,Just OK,"This can opener does the job... that is, it opens cans. However, it is not very powerful and it works very slowly. A decent feature is that the cutter can be removed to clean. Other than that, however, not much can be said about this item."
3,"ok for small cans, otherwise needs a little help","This can opener does a fine job opening small cans (tuna etc.) but with larger cans (15 oz. beans, soups) there are difficulties. The magnet cannot support a medium sized 15 oz. can, therefore you must hold the can in place while the opener turns. This is tricky, and it sounds hard on the motor (slow, sluggish, chugging.) In the future, I will try to leverage the 15 oz. cans with some cardboard wedges for support. Maybe this will be easier on the motor. Who knows? I'll give it a try!"
1,Not the best on the life of Luther.,"I agree with the person above who said this PBS documentary was bland. The dramatizations were sparse and unneccessary. Mostly, Luther is shown as an old man, riding in a cart, or on his deathbed, with cut-ins of scholars, expounding on his life and influence. Not really a ""Life and Times of Luther,"" but more of a ""Collection of Opinions about the Life and Times of Luther."" Very little is said about his faith. More is said about the politics of his times.Some better resources: Martin Luther (1953, starring Niall MacGinnis), Luther (2003, starring Joseph Fiennes). I even thought that Luther (1973, starring Stacy Keach), with all of its shortcomings, was a better presentation of Luther's life than this."
3,"Good, but not what it could be","This is a very well rounded documentary on Martin Luther. One of the interesting things about this documentary is that actors play luther and other people in Luther's life, this is a nice way to see a historical life play out instead of just through pictures and texts. The only thing that could have been better about this documentary was that it is a little bland for such a revoltutionary life."
5,Babylon In A Jar,"""After Muscling through sharp greenery and after lopping humped limbs back as far as lopping shears would take them""So begins a poem in Babylon In A Jar who's structure and form evokes the mythic narrative quality of the best of Gary Snyder married to the intuitive grasp of rhythm that Dylan Thomas wrote in so well. Hudgins speaks in a common language rich in metaphor of simple moments in life, yet without wallowing in the sentimental.This is by the far the strongest single voice in poetry to write consistently well - poem after poem, book after book, within the past decade. I checked out five of his titles from the library and opened each at random without disappointment. Nothing good said of this writer should be taken for hyperbole. Babylon In A Jar is among his best."
1,Don't waste your time/money,"Of course, with poetry, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This was recommended to me and I found it to be awful. Too bad there's no zero-star choice in ranking it."
5,Outstanding T.V.,"I have had the 4270 for 2 weeks and I am now finishing up my break in period. I have seen zero IR of burn in. I think as long as you turn down the settings on initial break in, and watch at full/zoom- you will be fine. I have other friends with various Pionner plasmas, and they have had zero burn in either, so I am unsure where any burn in issues are coming from....This TV is ridiculously nice- I researched pretty extensively, LCD v. Plasma, Panny, Sony, Philips, and on. I think at $1350 this TV is the best on the market period. Best picture, aestheically, it looks the best, and it has the top notch Pioneer quality. Another bonus, is the attached speaker on the bottom actually kicks out some good, quality sound and works very well until I get a home system put in.Bottom line, this tv is flawless so far, and I have zero complaints. If you are looking for a '42 - this TV is too good to pass up, pull the triggerI would have paid 2k for the set......"
1,Cheap Crap,"This product appeared to be a great idea and still is if it were made of a better plastic. I'm embarrassed to admit that I bought 3 of these and not one latest more then 2 months. The problem is that the plastic used is of very poor quality and tends to be very brittle and snap very easy. I have called and mailed the company to complain, but they never returned my calls or E- Mails. That tells me that they do not care or stand behind there product. I will no longer support them and buy any of there products again. Beware there are other companies out there that make the same cheap product, they are no better. There all made of the same cheap plastic."
5,Good!,"I honestly don't know why a lot of people are saying this is a cheaply made item? It's all plastic, yes, but mine works great! No problems at all. Picks everything up like it should too, especially in grass."
2,Not like my grampy!,I read this book because I am sad about my grampy. He has this disease and the book is not like what I am going through. Your own situation must be like this but mine is nothing like it. I'm not sure if you actually have had this experience in life. It's the only way to know what it is like. It is much harder to understand and it didn't exactly happen like in the book. Oh well maybe someone will enjoy it more!Thanks anyway
2,"Nice light output, terrible durability","The light these throw is excellent, the wiring harness includes everything needed, though I wired mine slightly different than shown. I ended up replacing the switch because the indicator light in the switch burned out within a couple days, their customer service is pretty bad as I called to get a replacement switch and they told me to uninstall the entire set up and return it to amazon. The biggest problem however, is the lights themselves. So far in under a year I had one completely shatter and I was forced to replace it and now my other has a vertical crack the entire length of the lens and will need to be replaced too. I always use the stone guards when these lights are not in use, which is far more often than when they are on. I'm looking for another brand to replace these with as hella turned out to be a hella big piece of garbage."
5,great target,I bought this for target practice with my .40 cal pistol and my .22 pistol works great for both. very sturdy steal construction I am fairly new to pistols so I am not the best shot I hit the fram with the .40 and it held up to the shots. Great buy!!!
4,Nice product,"I did take this out of the box and it should work great for my son and i. We plan to use it for 22, 17 and even 9mm. I gave it a 4 star because i haven't used it yet."
5,Awesome,Very nice and heavy duty. Shot some .22 pellets into it and it has held up very well. I can't wait to shoot some .22LR and some 9mm into it!
3,review for target,I like the principle & the movement I wish it were larger not the target but the frame it needs to stand higher
1,Broke 3 shots fired at it 9mm,"Product broke, just above bottom plate. I hit it 3 with 9mm times brand new out of the box... Extremely disappointed time at the range. I do not recommend buying this."
3,Not Very Challenging,"I expected to get my behind handed to me, and after about 10 minutes I was like, ""meh"". I've done the complete workout twice, I might do it again. It gets points for actually resembling a meditation tape, and I found myself focusing elsewhere while doing the workout, which was kind of nice. Very pretty sets, pretty instructor, and pretty piano music. I don't think I'll rely on this as a staple in my exercising repertoire, but may be relaxing every once in a while."
3,Challenging but not very exciting,"This is a really difficult work out (in my opinion anyways). Every move is done for four sets of 8, and at my level of fitness (I workout pretty much everyday and am in great shape) I can only manage three sets of most moves. It's almost entirely floor work and the workout is a bit uninspired. There's not much ballet incorporated into it besides a few minutes at the end during the standing series. I do this once a week and am never excited about it, but I do feel like it's one of the most challenging exercises in my rotation. If you're looking for more of a ballet-focused workout, I really love the xtend barre workouts."
1,Not A Ballet Workout,I was expecting a ballet barre type workout but this did not seem remotely ballet-like to me. I've been doing to Core Fusion workouts and really like them and was looking for so something to do do in conjuction with them. This definitely did not fit the bill. Basically a boring floor workout.
4,Tough but good,"This has good pieces to it.I don't do the video in the order it defaults to, because then all the easy stuff is at the end and you don't get a good warmup. The inner & outer thigh workouts were amazing! Abs and arms, eh. The bridge series is okay too, but doesn't seem to work my buns like it is supposed to.I like the pace of the videos, and the music isn't distracting."
3,Not Sure,"I bought this item as a gift for my step mother. I'm sure it is collecting dust with the other workout videos she ""needed"" to have in the past."
3,"Needs a ""how to"" introduction","This was a really good workout (I'm going to be sore for days), but it really needs an introduction that explains how to hold yourself, what the terms are that she's using, and how to do the moves that she's doing. She moves through things VERY quickly, so you don't get time to understand what you're doing before she's moving on to the next thing. I think a quick introduction that gives details on how to do the moves correctly (how to hold yourself, etc.) would make this good workout GREAT."
2,Doesnt play on my dvd player,I cant even play it on my dvd player because it does not support the content. Says I need a certain code to play it on my dvd.You should notify your customers that it may not be able to play in certain parts of the world. So frustrated.
2,Not what I expected,this dvd is straight up toning excercisethat is very intense with some very quick stretches in the middle that don't actually allow any strethching. There really is no ballet type exercise in this dvd. I think I'll trade it in.
2,Did not enjoy this workout,"I am not experienced dancer, so I found this workout uninspiring. The movements were very repetitious and the stretches between movements consisted of little more than bending and straightening the legs. While pleasant, the simple piano music in the background did nothing to add interest or motivation to the workout."
1,"Very few moves, repeats","This DVD was a letdown. She does just a few moves, and does them to exhaustion. So, of course it burns because you are doing the same move. Beginners would not have the strength in their legs to do these workouts, but if they do a little each day they will build up strength. No dancing in this video. Doubt I'll use this more than once or twice..."
2,Experienced ONLY!!,"If you're already in great shape or need a warm up because you've been an dancer for years, then this tape is for you. If not, skip it. The routine is really hard for someone who just wants to get a good workout. When Ms. Bowers stretched out by bringing her leg up, over and across her body to touch the floor behind her head -- in an effortless motion -- I knew I had purchased the wrong tape!! It will take me YEARS to achieve this level of flexibility and fitness. I just don't want to work this hard!!"
4,A bit advanced,"I tried this two days in a row and it is extremely fast paced. Might want to increase my flexibility before trying it again, but I am definitly looking forward to working out with Mary Helen Bowers more and more."
1,Extremely Repetitive!!,"This workout was just way too boring for me. It was extremely repetitive and totally uninspired. The scenery, music, and Mary Helen Bowers were all beautiful, but a workout DVD has to be more than just looks."
3,Effective but Repetitive,"This workout is done somewhat rigidly in sets of reps, and Mary counts off each rep, which can be annoying. After each set, there is a stretch so brief I can't imagine it is effective, but I don't seem to be any the worse for that after the workout. You have the option of doing the workout with music and without Mary's constant counting.I find this workout challenging (in fact, I can only manage about 70% of the work; on a bad day even 50%) but it does give you results. If you're feeling particularly brain-dead, it doesn't take much focus to follow along. Mary is lovely to look at, has a nice voice, and the cool look of the set is nice."
3,pretty basic,"i guess i was looking for the workouts to offer a little more exertion than it did. it wasn't overly expensive, but for the price i paid, i expected more extensive training to be offered. it was nothing that i couldn't find on youtube on my own."
4,Nice workout with good presentation.,"This was a challenging work-out that targets individual areas. Some of the routines are close to impossible to finish (and I consider myself to be in pretty good shape), but Ms. Bowers never appears even slightly winded. Not at all an aerobic work-out (although I think she makes a few comments that it is), and the arm work-out in particular is fairly minimal, but one should probably expect that in a ballet based routine. I found the long introductory music segments before each new section to be annoying as it is impossible to switch quickly from one section to another. I wouldn't rely on this as my only strengthening DVD, but it makes a nice change."
4,hard,I have only did one day of this work out. I never thought ballet would have your muscles sore wow
3,3.5 stars if I could ...,"Beautiful, she's lovely and gives good pointers to beginners but she moves to FAST for beginners and doesn't explain some of the positions so if you have had no ballet ever you'd be lost! Plus HELLO if you are beginner there's no way you can stretch like that, some explanation of stretching,etc would be helpful"
5,Quality Arabic Black Metal,"I bought Arallu's CD ""Satanic War in Jerusalem a few years back. These guys play raw, dirty, and fast Black Metal and do it well. To me, they sounda bit like Immortal, old School Black/Death bands of the 80's & 90's. The vocals are barked out, similar to Venom. Being from a land that know s what war is like, these guys know what they're talking about. Check them out for yourself."
2,I need help,I have been using the book and I have a problem. My teacher wont help me and it is to hard so I am trying to find the translations in english. I need help.
4,Deep Impact is intense!!!!!,"This is my first ECW dvd purchase, and I am absolutely sastified with my purchase. I have heard about ECW doing their best of collection, so I decided to buy one. And Deep Impact has not failed to deliver their trademark matches. First of all, Tajiri and Pichosis is without a doubt among the top five non-hardcore matches in ECW history. And Sabu and the Funker cannot be missed, they are the craziest s.o.b's to put out such an intense match. Taz and Bigelow is also has a ECW trademark in thier match, the ending cannot be missed. If you are an ECW fan, get the collection. I'm planning on buying the other three DVD's."
5,deep impact,"this is ecw like it should be now adays.but anyway 1st of all Sabu vs the funker BORN TO BE WIRED a hellasious barbwire match a must see.Also a 3 way between Steve Austin, Mikey whipreck,sandman 3 way average;Funk,sandman vs Foley,Douglas in which foley gets burned a hardcore classic + Taz vs Bigelow from 98 good hard hitting match..."
5,This Will Be Historical,"ECW Deep Impact will be a must have DVD simply for just one match. Everything else to me is a bonus. This match was one of the most brutal matches ever, it was Born to be Wired. Sabu vs. Terry Funk in a barb wire match for the ECW Heavyweight Championship. To say it was incredible would be insulting to the effort these competitors put in for the match. Every so called hardcore match after that will be nothing compared to this battle. It was not a total gorefest as some people would think reading this, but it did have a lot of blood. If you want a piece of ECW history that you can watch over and over again then I recomend you get this DVD. I have seen tapes of the Born to be Wired match be sold for an average of 20-35 dollars, for just that match, this is DVD quality and you get at least 5 other great matches. This is an absolute must have for any wrestling fan."
3,very good,"i was very satisfied when i bought extreme evolution. however path of destruction isn't has hardly any extreme matches. you get 7 average matches... none suck, but they are great. if you want to see big bumps don't get this DVD. stick with RF Video or Extreme evolution. hopefully the next DVD from ECW will be more hardcore. But if you are a hardcore ECW fan or just a respectable fan then you should buy the DVD, you will get your money's worth. If you just like big bumps, save your 25 bucks"
1,poor,"Ok, so I've gone to streetbrawls.com and that site offers greater value than this tape. I did not like the tape. In fact, I returned the video in consideration of the poor quality. Shop elseware."
4,real good movie,"Awesome movie,would of been alot better if Elijah Wood was not in it.He just seemed a little out of character.Edward Norton or someone who can be a bit nerdy but also tough would of been better.Oh well still a real good movie."
1,Avoid,"This film is well intentioned but awful in it's execution. If you want to see a film that is closer to the truth of football-related violence in England, find ``The Firm'' with Gary Oldman from the 1980s.Green Street Hooligans suffers from being made and acted by people who have no personal connection to the subject matter. Attempts to portray the reality of such gangs come accross as staged and false. The attempts of some of the actors to do authentic accents makes it laughable to anyone who has been within a 1000 miles of England. That's unfortunate as the film looks OK and seems to be reasonably well shot."
5,"Charlie Hunnam, I love you","I won't lie, I bought this because I think Charlie Hunnam is the sexiest man God has made thus far :D. This movie however blew me away, it was amazing, it's about a Harvard student (Wood) who gets kicked out when his roommate sets him up for his own stuff. He has no where to go so he moves in with his sister in London and gets caught up with her brother, and the thug life in London. It's an amazing movie and I don't want to give too much away, it's worth a watch."
4,great movie,gives light to a side of football (soccer here in the US) not known about by those outside the football world. where there are sports and beer...violence is bound to follow
4,Great flick,"I liked this one a lot. If you like Snatch or Boondock Saints you might like this one as well. It was pretty good, seen it a few times now. I'd recommend it."
5,Raw and Honest,"I was told about the movie by a friend and I am sure glad he told me about it. The fight scenes were somewhat violent but just showed the reality of these ""firms"". I thought the end scene where Matt confronts his old roomate portrays the point shown at the end of the fight scene between the GSE and the Millwall fans. He knew when to walk away as he says after the fight and that just illustrated that point."
5,Wow,"This movie totally surprised me!!Albeit some parts seemed unrealistic it is a fictional piece that still talks to the human sprit--""standing your ground"" and not giving in even if you are only maybe 5'7"" and weigh what? maybe 120 pounds soaking wet like fab Elijah.I love Elijah, and it was interesting to see him meld into this sort of role. And of course Charlie Hunnam is a HOTTIE!Loved it."
4,Violent underbelly of London,"An American expelled from Harvard moves to London to be near his sister and gets drawn into the world of football firms or gangs that use their allegience to the local squad as a reason for incredibly violent brawling with rivals. The film is somewhat cliched but still very engaging as it explores a side of British culture rarely explored in commercial films.Well acted for the most part, the violent fight scenes at times degenerate into slow motion blood spitting montages but overall I enjoyed the movie."
3,"Good, but not as good as I.D.","Similarly set up to the 1995 film I.D. (though not as good), Green Street Hooligans sheds light on organized crime and hooliganism in England.A Harvard student and journalism major is framed by his roommate and expelled from college on allegations of narcotics possession. Flying to England to visit his sister he gets drawn to the world of football violence.Elijah Wood, and most of the cast's acting is pretty good, but nothing great.Claire Forlani was delightful as Shannon; let's see more of her!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music, are overall good.In short, though not as good as I.D., Green Street Hooligans is still a film that will provide for an evenings' entertainment."
3,Bubbles Pretty Bubbles,I thought this was a pretty good movie. I am a Yank and I know little about football. But I still enjoyed this movie and all the actors although I found it hard to believe that the little Lord of the Rings guy was a badass or became one or could beat up anybody. Still a pretty good flick.
5,Great Movie,"I have a huge movie collection(500+)and this is in my top 50. Not a very well known movie, but very good. It is entertaining and keeps you interested in the main character."
4,Good.,"I'm not a fan of violence, but this movie was successful in making me understand to some degree how men such as these could enjoy wich a brutal hobby. I thought the struggle the central character went through was convincing and fascinating. It was only too bad that a few hokey moments sneaked in at the end."
5,Wow! What a surprise.,"I don't think many people say ""Wow there's a new Elijah Wood film I just gotta see"". No they don't. But soon they may be saying ""Wow there's a new Charlie Hunnam film that I gotta see"".When I started watching this DVD I wasn't expecting much. I'm not really a fan of English movies because I have a hard time hearing and understanding their dialect. But as soon as Charlie Hunnam appears on the screen he demands your attention. He puts in a riveting performance as do the others in this gem. This is a violent movie, perhaps it's more of a guy's movie then a woman's but it is a powerful movie with many powerful performances.For me it was an introduction to the Hooligan gangs that patronize the soccer games in Europe. It seems we Americans are quite ignorant of the phenomenon.Everyone I have recommended this movie to have said it was one of the best movies they have seen in a long time. I highly recommend it."
2,i believe the dvd is USED not NEW like stated,"i ordered a ""new"" dvd, or so i thought, i opened the dvd which was obviously re-wrapped in much thicker plastic then dvds normally come in, anyway i opened the dvd and it had numerous scratches all over it, which clearly means it was NOT new and it was USED and wrapped again.. Had it been a more expensive item i would have returned it, but its not worth the hassle, i will take my loss and go to a legit store and buy the same dvd for a few bucks more considering i spent double on shipping....They may resolved my issue with the dvd but its not worth it for me to go through the hassle for a $4 dvd ..."
3,Cute Ring,"I wasn't extremely impressed when I received this product, but then again it was inexpensive. The band with the cz looks good but the other silver band had rough edges and I just didnt like it. I would recommend it for a teenager or youth. I will say it was very cute for the price. Great design."
3,pretty but...,"I love silver, and CZ but I thought they'd be a bit shinier! Wear it everyday though so it must not be too bad eh?"
1,Cosmetic,When I received the ring I was so happy! It came and the box was beautiful. The shine on the ring was excellent. But if you are one of those people who never take off your jewelry then this is not the ring for you. Within two weeks the ring had already started to discolor. The rusty tinge made it look so fake! Definately not good. I wish I could get my money back!
2,Wrong size???,"This ring is very nice; I like the looks of it. The only problem is that I bought this ring to wear in place of my wedding ring toward the end of my pregnancy. I ordered it a full size larger so I was sure it would fit. When it arrived, I couldnt even get it on my finger. When you hold it up to my wedding ring, they look to be the same size. The box it came in gave no indication as to which size was sent. So, they either sent the wrong size, or they run small somehow. I guess it will be worn after the birth of my son instead of now."
2,CZ are sooooo small,"The ring looks pretty different from the picture online.CZ stones are really small.Although it's ok for its price, I still feel a little deceived."
3,could be better,"the ring is beautiful but one of the stones fell out the second day i had it. i still wear it occasionally, but have to turn it a certain way so it doesnt show. ok for the price, but stones could be set better."
5,SS CZ Twin Band Ring,"I ordered four rings at the same time from Gem Avenue, they were delivered quickly and I was impressed with each one. This ring however has garnished me with the most compliments. What a beautiful ring, and for the price -- it's an amazing deal!The ring is a little wide, so I wear it on my pointer finger, but it always catches peoples attention! The little gift boxes the rings come in are darling!This product is a great value!"
5,Scholarly Book with great color photos,"I was greatly impressed with the historical text in the beginning of the book, which sets the stage for the rest. I have several books on Kyoto and Gardens of Japan, but this one is now my favorite."
4,"Nice, but small","My daughter wears a size 4 shoe, so I bought a size 4 flip flop. They fit almost exactly like the ones she had from last year that were a 3. I called Teva and they replaced them with a 6 to give a little more room for growth. But the quality of the flip flops is great and they last a long time."
3,Great book for a get to know feeling with issac newton,"The book, Isaac Newton and the Scientific Revoultion, was a good book beacause it went futher than the inventions and into Isaac Newton, the man. The book showed his public and private fueds with rival scientists. The books also shows his emotions; lots of resenment and hate, love of the unknown, and joy of experinicng life to the fullest. The only bad part of the book was it was to fast; it didn't show enough of the discoverery, it raced along to show what happened to Newton after the discovery like his fame and how it destroyed his rivals. But in the end you feel like you knew Newton and lived in the Scientiic revolution."
3,4 Minutes of Here With Me,"Buying this DVD is a difficult decision: now matter how great the experience, you get very few minutes of it. If you are a die-hard DIDO fan, get it. Otherwise, bide your time until a more complete DVD comes out with more footage and additional features -- this DVD is short on both."
3,pretty decent,"this dvd contains the music video to the song Here With Me, a live performance of the song Thank You (performed with only a guitar backing), a bio about Dido and a photo gallery. the photos and bio are the identical to the ones at the official Dido website (and every other website as of 01/2001 for that matter).I bought this dvd despite the fact that Here With Me is probably being my least favorite song on the No Angel album, because I really like the song Thank You. The video for Here With Me is pretty good (perhaps better than the video to Thank You) and the Live version of Thank You is fine. Honestly I was somehow hoping for more, but this disc contains exactly what it says it does, so I can't get too bent out of shape. I was probably just spoiled by Bjork's Volumen or something.other info: on this disc her shirts have very long v's in the necks. and the main menu is tastefully animated with music."
3,Half & Half,"I really enjoyed Here with me. Thankyou was done more like an unplugged intimate thing, but did not impress me. Overall it is pretty short to just put two songs on a DVD. The CD on the other hand is awesome."
2,Disappointing Re-Issue,"This was a disappointment. It is really unfortunate that for this price no effort was put into re-mixing or re-mastering these two iconic albums. After years of listening to the original vinyl in college on my old Acoustic Research stereo system these modern digital discs played on equipment superior to my old AR gear were an unpleasant surprise. The sound is flat, muddy and thin. The music and the energy still stand out. These classics deserved better treatment."
5,Still good,I have this album on vinyl which I still listen to. It's getting old and well played so I added this cd to my collection.
1,Where's the enhancement?,"I purchased this CD and although the sound is great I find no enhancement on it. I wrote the company and we bickered back and forth, I see the original one that was up they touted as Rhino-WEA and when I questioned the Elektra they stated the E in WEA stood for Elektra, so it came as a German import not a UK import as stated in the description. Lastly, I found no data on the CD which would make it an ""ENHANCED"" CD and they never responded when I ask them for their definition of the word... Is it worth the cost? Guessing that would be up to you"
2,Too old,This book was published too long ago to be relevant. I don't recommend buying it. Look for something more up to date.
4,Absolutely fascinating!,"Reading Mr. Morehouse's experience in his remote viewing of Dachau concentration camp, literally raised the hair on the back of my neck. I had previously visited Dachau while I was stationed in Germany. Incredible!"
1,Doesn't add up,"This book could have been an interesting novel, but that's about it. Way too many inconsistencies...like the carbon monoxide incident. Yes, carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, but the exhaust of a ""Briggs and Stratton"" engine is far from odorless. The fact that his daughter suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning and was rushed to the hospital, (her lips were blue), yet the firemen allowed the rest of them to remain in the house while they ""aired"" it out. Six hours later (after being delayed from the hospital for an hour and a half) David went to pick up his wife and daughter...YEAH RIGHT!!! As a diesel mechanic I know all too well the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning...it takes a long time to get over it.His whole mission was to reveal remote viewing to ""save mankind"", and can now be learned from him at $1,200 a class. What a humanitarian!!!Also his mentor and good friend, Mel Riley, is working with Lyn Buchanan instead of Mr. Morehouse. In this book 5 + 5 = 12."
3,Psychic fiction?,"This book may be a mixture of fact and fiction.In online discussions with several former members from the Coordinate Remote Viewing unit at Fort Meade, David Moorehouse's book drew strong venom from most of the people who were there. They said that Moorehouse's account of the Stargate Project is somewhat embellished.Specifically, that his accounts of remote viewing sessions are plagiarized versions of lectures given at the Monroe Institute's Gateway Voyage program. That they are somewhat fictionalized accounts of out-of-body experiences rather than actual coordinate remote viewing, which does not involve actually ""seeing"" the targets.That being said, the book still is very interesting and whether you believe Moorehouse's account or not, remote viewing is for real and is one of the most significant discoveries of the century, if not all time."
2,Where's The Proof?,"After a promising start, this book devolved into anecdote after anecdote of the author's supposed remote viewing trips and the ill effects on his mental state and marriage. Could have been a decent article in a magazine, but for a full length book, it didn't work for me. Plus, if I say I entered a state of mind and remote viewed something, does that make it true? Where was the proof that it could really be done?"
5,Fascinating reading. Hard to put down.,"A great book. I read it almost non-stop. An interesting disclosure about government secret activities. Morehouse probably should not have become involved with this group. Am glad he was able to get out of it alive. Reads like a spy novel, but best of all it is true."
4,Well worth reading,"This book is well worth reading for anyone interested in psi in general, or remote viewing in particular. For a more comprehensive overview of remote viewing, I also recommend Jim Schnabel's _Remote Viewers : The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies_. You'd also enjoy a book by another remote viewer, Joseph McMoneagle's _Mind Trek : Exploring Consciousness, Time, and Space Through Remote Viewing_.If you have a chance to hear David Morehouse speak, or to attend one of his classes, do so!As an aside, the previous reviewer who disbelieved the book because ""there were no ovens at Dachau"" is wrong: there were five ovens at Dachau, each with a capacity of several bodies. Check the web."
2,The psychic warfare program might have existed...,"but I'm not sure if this book is the best place to learn about it. Too many things on the military side don't seem to add up and it left me wondering how much of the information in this book is accurate, how much is conjecture and how much is just sensationalism.I don't doubt that the U.S. conducted research into remote viewing... evidence is very strong that the Soviets did as well during the Cold War. But remote viewing would have been of very little value and the program itself a dead-end militarily. It's a pity that there don't seem to be any books which seriously looks at this subject, the origins behind it, any possible successes, etc. Instead all we seem to have is this.A fascinating read, but take it with a grain of salt."
2,"An entertaining, if inaccurate account of remote viewing","""Psychic Warrior"" is admittedly an easy-to-read and entertaining account (even if the writing is a bit formulaic and riddled with trivial textual errors). And it accomplished its primary goal: to sell itself to Hollywood. But unfortunately it is also a highly inaccurate portrayal of the remote viewing process and its history within the U.S. government. A much better (and, ironically, less-expensive) book is Jim Schnabel's ""Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies"" (also available from Amazon)"
3,Silly delusions.,"I am as of yet to become aware of a single episode of ""remote viewing"" that is not in fact the product of imagination. I don't want to believe the US government would waste so much time and money on something that doesn't exist. Just because I can vividly imagine events on the other side of the world and in the past or future with great accuracy doesn't mean it is a separate sense. It is imagination coupled with intelligence, anyone who thinks it is some special reality is deluding themselves and fraudulently pursuing funding."
3,Interesting but check this out,"This is a very interesting story, but only a fraction of it is true. Check out; (...)""The accounts in his book are, at best, a highly fictionalized version of events that transpired.""""The fact is this book is the epitome of hypocrisy. Morehouse, encouraged by St. Martins Press, has hit a series of topical ""hot buttons"" including, angels, Government assassination conspiracies, and Gulf War syndrome, family values, and wrapped them in the American flag. There is abject disregard for truth. Do not buy this book. If you must read it, borrow it from library."""
1,"Pure egotistical, twisted accounts of the truth.","This book is exactly that. I know Mr. Morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book... my father, Mel Riley. All I can say is, you should read Paul Smith's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the Stargate and RV stories. There is also a documentary, if you can find it, made be Discovery BBC called ""The Real X-files"" featuring a true and honest view of RV and it's history with the military and all those involved. Giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence."
4,Fact or fiction?,I find the brain/mind to be very interesting. This book (assuming it is indeed true begins to explore our potential.
3,I've read the cover...,"Notice in the title that this book is about an ""Awakening."" That's all you really need to know in order to understand the authors' motives. That is, of course, if you already understand that the controllers are using suggestive language to facilitate your, yes YOUR, brainwashing. It is hoped that eager beavers will buy into the idea of millenarian ""Enlightenment"" which basically means you've given up thinking on your own and resigned yourself to a life of consumerism and obedience under the reign of a shallow, elitist and capital C Communist core of Satanists."
1,Total tripe,"The only things sadder than this ho-hum, poorly-told tale is the fact that not only do plenty of people believe it wholesale, but that (as garnered from other reviews) many of its readers actually find it ""well-written"" and ""moving"". Frankly, I fear for the future of mankind. Just about any episode of ""X-Files"" is more entertaining, and my third-grade report on ""ESP"" was probably just as accurate as anything herein. Oh well, back to Jean Jacques Rousseau."
2,"Sci-Fiesque fiction, clearly Anti-Government leaning","I read this book with amusement, It was shallow, hollow and filled with inaccuracies.The implication that our Government is so utterly sinister is not only outrageous, but smacks of hysterical alarmnest fiction. It is indeed a waste of paper, I would not reccomend this book to anyone except to diehard X-files devotees."
2,Wanted so much to like it.,"Morehouse's book begins to unravel as one reads. The accounts of remote-viewed things were far too generic and received (ark of the covenant, Mars, complete with ancient living beings, angels in flowing robes no less who guide him) to be believable. Truth has a certain baroque quality, which this story is lacking. Also, the reader is informed that angels informed Morehouse that they live in ""a dimension parallel to yours."" Hunh? We live in a three dimensional world (if you do not count time as a dimension) in which each dimension is perpendicular to the other two. So how is some other dimension parallel to all of these three? And are the angels saying they exist in a single dimension? They inhabit a straight line? We are further informed that God lives in a four-dimensional world. Gee, so do we, if you count time, which most physicists do. So... what distinction is being made? The story smacks of the scientifically impoverished imaginings of the author."
5,Great!,"Even though this show is 20 years old, it was great to watch it. Despite his problems, Michael Jackson was a performer to be reckoned with. That Billie Jean performance never gets old. This video also has one of Marvin Gaye's last performances. Knowing his fate and watching his perfomance is almost haunting. There were so many great performers at Motown so I'm still baffled as to why they spent so much time featuring acts like Linda Ronstadt and those dancers when they could have featured more performances by Martha Reeves and the Commodores. Finally, we also see the performance by Diana Ross that marked her downfall. Too bad most of her behavior was edited out. Her bump and grind on Where Did Our Love Go is something that could have used some editing. I don't understand why Motown won't release this special on DVD along with their other products like the Jackson 5 cartoon and Lady Sings the Blues."
5,Motown 25,"This was a classic show - saw it first when it was broadcast before DVR, DVD when one couldn't save it for future. It was great. I'm glad I own it."
4,Hale to The Funk Brothers,"Wow! I was blown away to find out that all that great music that I litened to, fourty years ago came from about a dozen Black and white folks that were affectionately known as the Funk Brothers.Like a lot of people I thought thoes great artists,Like Marvin gay and Stevy Wonder, the temps, the tops I thought they went to motown, with there own Bands and came out with a hit.The funk brothers were Barry Gordy's personal selection of musicians he had hand picked and is very plain that the funk brothers were very much responibale for that great motown music that came out of studio (A) that is listened to by the entire world.I thought the video (standing in the shadows of motown)was an out standing documentary but also a great tribute the funk brothers that truly made motown great.Of course motown wouldn't be Motown without the thoes great artist's; But where would they have been without the funk!.so... Hale to the Funk brothers ,they were great. MC"
1,A foolish take on an important topic,"Why Nylund would choose to classify Huck Finn as ADD/ADHD is odd. Did he take other factors into account, such as Huck's physically and emotionally abusive alcoholic father, who is a criminal and often absent? Or the fact that he comes from a single-parent, broken home (having lost his mother at a very young age)?Still, may be helpful to thopse dealing with ADD/ADHD (parents or therapists)."
2,??,"Oh . . where to begin. First of all, I love Diane Keaton - in fact I like all of the lead characters. But this movie is SO bad - I couldn't believe how bad it was. It supposed to be about Diane Keaton being a 'smothering' mother - huh?? You don't even see her do that much. Maybe it's the writing, I don't know. It just didn't make any sense at all. Except for Ken Howard (Diane Keaton's husband) - he was the best of the lot - the second star is for him."
3,"KEATON IS MORE CRAZY THAN SMOTHERING, BUT IT GETS BETTER AS IT GOES ALONG!","Another screwball comedy with a good cast, this one with Diane Keaton as a kooky woman who comes to stay with her son and his wife during a fight with her husband. At first it's more irratating than funny, but it does have some good laughs as the film progresses(the Funeral is a highlight). It's nothing special, but it's not all that bad either."
2,couldn't finish,I could not finish this movie. Got too boring in the first half hour. Sad cause I like Diane Keaton.
3,AVERAGE FILM,"This film was okay so I cannot recommend it unless you are big fan of Diane Keaton, Liv Tyler or Dax Shepard.The movie had some pretty funny moments (most of it is crude) but the bad acting (Liv Tyler's delivery was wooden), over acting (Diane Keaton was over the top) and lame script did not make for a great comedy. There are better overbearing mom movies out there to watch (Monster-in-Law (New Line Platinum Series)comes to mind).This movie was watched while I was sick and taking NyQuil D so I might have added a star too many."
2,Diane Keaton just seems crazy,"This movie has a funny concept that usually can't fail - overbearing parents. However,Smotherjust isn't that funny. Rather than being funny, Diane Keaton's character often just appears annoying and crazy. Rather than smothering her son, she seems like she should be put in an insane asylum. I don't think I laughed much at all throughout the movie. At the end, I just ended up feeling depressed about the characters complaining that they had wasted their lives. I was also upset when Dax Shepard yelled at the geese. Not funny.If you want really funny comedy about a smothering mother, check out the sitcomEverybody Loves Raymond - The Complete Series."
2,A slender story,"Rachel Griffiths, some beautiful singing, and the hills of South Wales don't save this from being rather trite."
3,Very Welsh Quirky with a terrific cast to pull it off!,"This is one charming if not extremely oddly refreshing 100 minutes.The story and it's characters are totally implausible, but the overly-talented cast of Ionn Gruffudd,Rachel Griffiths,Jonathan Pryce and others really shine as they always do.There are laughs and there are tears,and there is stunning cinematography of South Wales;but the storyline is just too bizarre for it's own good.Alot of belief has to be suspended in order to savour this 'Very Welsh Quirky"".I think maybe 3-1/2 *s is most appropriate.Still,one viewing is worth the time. Companion filmsto VERY ANNIE MARY would be BIG EDEN and STATE AND MAIN."
3,"weird, but endearing","Very Annie Mary is definitely one of the weirdest films I've seen and has some of the weirdest characters, including Annie Mary in the major role, but at the same time it certainly has its appeal and leaves a strong impression. Makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you wonder. The story sounds simple when reading the summary, but you have to watch the story to see what can lie behind ""simple"" things. Like Annie Mary seems simple, simply simple-minded with not much to say or to think or to feel - but it's only the surface. You can see that Annie Mary has her own dreams, feelings, desires and is willing to fight for them, even if she does not / cannot do it like ""normal"" people do.Rachel Griffith was great in this role, evoking all kinds of cathartic emotions: compassion, pity, liking, strong dislike sometimes and respect.Sometimes I still don't know what to think of this film, but I certainly won't forget it in a long time to come."
1,Power plug getting stuck,"There is definitely a problem with some Nintendo DS power plugs. They are getting stuck. I just bought one and have been checking the online forums. It is not a problem with the cable, but with the DS."
1,Do NOT buy for the DS Lite!,"I got my DS Lite today and picked up this travel pack for it as well. I charged the DS on the way home and everything was fine... until I went to remove the car adapter. It was stuck. I mean, seriously stuck. So stuck that we thought it was locked in place and we had to press on something to get it out.We couldn't figure out it for the longest time, even after having my dad, a mechanical engineer, examine it-- the best suggestion he could offer was just to pull incredibly hard. I was so afraid I would break the DS, I didn't want to try it, but finally my boyfriend took a pair of pliers and managed to get it out. My DS is fine, but I will NEVER use that adapter again.DO NOT BUY!"
2,A PC Game Fan,"When I got this game I thought it was cool, but when I got it was a normal role-playing game. The graphic's were fairly good. It feels like a very short game. They say it has sixty hours of game play, but it feels like only a few hours. They also need to change the content rating from ""M"" to ""Teen"". That's why I would give it two stars"
2,Not for me,"The author truly fails to see the real balance in the world. Alaska is no different than every other geographical place in this world...failure to protect from the human race usually leads to disaster. But failure to take advantage of a country's natural resources leads to poverty. He doesn't seem to realize that all the flights he takes, driving the VW van around, tossing a camera with a battery in it...is as toxic for our environment as anything else.I truly didn't care for the writing as it drifted off into old memories, yet the topic itself, Alaska, is fascinating. Too bad the author failed to captilize on it, and instead focused on the politics."
3,not enthusiastic,"I bought these toaster tongs to replace an old cheap pair from England, which didn't attempt to be nicely crafted, but which worked much better. The English pair lasted for more than twenty years, and gripped the toast better. Because the old pair were metal, I suppose there may have been some danger of electric shock from them, but I never had trouble with them. This wooden Adams pair is prettier, but the two parts of the tongs that slide down along the sides of the toast are thicker than the corresponding parts of the English pair, which impedes their working. Also the cheap English pair squeezed onto the toast more easily. In the Adams pair, the squeezing action is tight and limited by the nature of the wood. Most of the time, I find myself lifting the toast out with a knife or my fingers instead of using the Adams tongs, simply because they aren't terribly well suited to the task."
4,Work great for toaster pastry,"I bought these specifically for Nature's Path organic toaster pastries which are shorter and thinner than bread. The tongs work perfectly so no more burned finger tips. I don't understand how others are having an issue w/ the length or the grasping ability. They have perfect flexibility to grasp 1/8-1/4 inch and can reach to the botton of a regular depth toaster. The magnet is a nice touch, just wished it had a sheath to protect it. I plan to purchase more as gifts."
1,Very Unhappy with Tongs,"I was very unhappy with these tongs because they were (1) too short to reach English muffins in the toaster; (2) too stiff (probably because they were too short and had no ""give""); and (3) broke because I had to squeeze them too tightly in order to grasp anything being taken out of the toaster. The only redeeming feature was the magnet on the back."
5,Nifty Grippers,"These are terrific toast tongs. That's three T's to make the point. Totally American from the Green Hills of Vermont (at least so it seems). They grip the toast just right. No more pushing a knife into the bread or muffin at the risk of hitting the zone where the electricity lurks. If you like tongs, go for these and your tong-yearning will be satisfied. You'll like the toast too. You can also gamble with meeting the gods of electricity with a knife. I'd rather buy and use tongs."
5,Great for toast to bagels and no burned fingers,Had something like this years ago and lost it. This is quality made with a nice magnetic touch---I put in right on the toaster and everyone knows where it is!!! This is also a practical gift idea as alot of people don't even realize they make something like this...
5,Works perfectly,This works very well and has a built-in magnet to allow it to hang on the side of a nearby appliance ... like the refrigerator.
2,The things that can be done with pocket change...,"This film is really cheap and really cheesy. Do not buy. Rent.On the plus side, the plot line could have been decent. It was hard to tell under the bad acting and poor film quality(ever taped something SLP? Like that.) There's a short Henry Rollins sighting (one line) and both Stan Lee and Frank Miller have bit parts. If you've ever played Whitewolf's Vampire RPG, you'll recognize the vampires."
4,"Sexy suspence and horror, not for the weak of intellect",Blair's first attempt at a feature length film is quite impressive. He melds together the intense images of gothic horror and supernatural sexuality. This film is not for the faint of heart or weak of intellect. The metaphors for the frailty of the human spirit and it's susceptability to be seduced by the lure of vampire imortalty are intriguing.
1,sham2475 is right!!,"To whoever criticized sham2475's excellent hate review towards these sorry excuses for human beings,, you're a stupid idiot and YOU'RE the poser for actually bleeding your ears with this ""music""! I bet you're one of the dumb little ""gC rEpReZeNtAz"" and you always talk about ""waLdORf"" and ""bEnJi aNd JoEL""- oh shut up already!like sham2475 said, this is BSB with distortion, made for rich preppy mallrats who think they're 'punk' for going to Hot Topic.... POSERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GC sux, emo sux, and all posers suck- Listen to REAL punk like PENNYWISE!DOWN WITH GOOD CHARLOTTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Once again, the irony is so delicious :)"
5,GC is awesome as always,"this album truly shows how Good Charlotte has evolved from this band that constantly talks about how everyone sterotypes them and basically they are who they are. i don't care what anyone says, but if you say they're punk, you're wrong, if you say they're pop or pop punk, you're still wrong. Good Charlotte has made themselves a genre of their own similar to how Nirvana did when they first hit it big and people were trying to categorize them. Cemetery... is a Silverchair song which GC did a cover of. personally i didn't really care for their version as much as the original. Joel just doesn't have the right kind of sound for singing a song like Cemetery. but still, the cd is awesome from beggining to end. keep it up you guys. mad love to GC."
4,Awesome,"I love almost all of the songs on this cd. ""The Day That I Died"" is different from the others. ""Movin On"" is my favorite. Good Charlotte is cool and I like the guy who plays the drums. I hate ""A New Beginning,"" ""Say Anything,"" ""Young and hopeless,"" and ""Bloody Valentine."" I like the other songs. All in all this cd is awesome!"
5,good charlotte rocks,"i bought this cd when it first came out and if you are into punk rock bands like blink-182, mest,NFG, etc. you will deffinetly love this cd. It is a GREAT follow up to their first CD! Reciently I went to the Civic tour that they were at and they sounded AWESOME! it was like listening to the cd, but they were there. They have great TALENT and if you are thinking about buying a new cd you should deffinetly buy this 1!"
5,The grandaddy of wargaming,In 1913 HG Wells wrote this book on wargaming.This edition includes many of the original illustrations. The block buildings in the photos are evocativeof the Moorlocks' buildings in The Time Machine. Although some of Wells rules have been surpassed many of his ideas for wargaming are still relevant today. Best of all is his humour and whimsical imagination.
5,Before the Big War,"What a treat to finally be able to read the original words of H.G. Wells' ""Little Wars."" I'd seen it mentioned many times in other literature and I knew it was a treasured piece. And indeed it is.I learned that many of the wargame rules I used as a youngster had already been perfected by Wells decades before. As a historian, I was intrigued that Wells had developed and published these concepts just before the Great War. Wells' comments are timeless, especially a remark in his final chapter, ""You have only to play at Little Wars three or four times to realise just what a blundering thing Great War must be.""This 82 page book also features Wells' own sketches and photos of his indoor and outdoor wargames. This is a great book to add to your collection."
5,Been looking for this,"Nice to see this back in print. Had a huge influence on miniatures gaming and RPGs, as Gary Gygax mentions in his forward."
5,Very Cool and a Bargain Too,"A game, an illustrated historical text, and a humorous read all in one!H.G. Wells took his hobby of wargaming very seriously, as shown by the photos of Edwardian gentlemen crouched or lying prone on the lawn ready to ""kill"" each other's toy soldiers. The book consists of explanations of how he and his friends developed their game rules, the game rules themselves, variations on the rules for indoor and outdoor games, suggestions on toy soldiers and the construction of buildings and other game pieces, a demonstration game, and suggested expansions on the rules. Photos and hilarious little drawings accompany all these and during the demo game Wells ""transforms"" himself into his imagined soldierly counterpart, the fierce mustachioed General H.G.W. of the Blue Army.Any wargamer should have this in their library (at this price you can't afford NOT to) and fans of Wells will enjoy this pleasant surprise, back after so many years."
4,One of the most professional martial arts video,"As a student of Oshiro sensei, I am very happy that this video is being marketed outside of Dragon Times/Tsunami productions and receiving wide acceptance. The production is extremely professional and brings out the mastery of Oshiro sensei. Uchinadi II also has a treat for Yamanni-ryu kobudo practitioners in that it shows two sai katas in a way that only Oshiro sensei could perform! I hope that in future productions Tsunami will incorporate more bunkai oyo applications for viewers to appreciate the power and grace of Oshiro sensei's karate."
2,Stroller Problems,"Whereas this is a good bargain, the stroller is not very sturdy. In comparison to one of my friends Grace Quatro stroller, this one is rickety. I have even exchanged the stroller once thinking it was just a defective one. Yet, I have the same problem with the new one. The other pieces of the 'package' are great though. Point of the story, I would pass on this one."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"I registered for this and so for we love it. It is easy to fold up and fits easily into my small trunk. the only thing I don't like it that the tray scrapes the ground when you fold it up. My baby has not even sat in this without the carseat yet, and the tray is all scratched up. I have never used the diaper bag that came with it because it is so small. Otherwise it is a great buy."
4,Great Stroller.,"I like this stroller because it works well and is very sturdy. I like the fact that it comes with two car seat bases, one for each car so you can click it in and out of the car with hardly a thought. I rode in someone elses car and had to install it without the bases... what a pain.The things that I don't like about this stroller are that it folds to the ground and the snack tray keeps getting scraped, and the basket underneath is a little difficult to get to when the seat is fully reclined (which it has to be when the infant car seat is snapped in). I also have not used the small diaper bag that it comes with because I usually lug around more stuff, but I'm sure that I will use it down the road. The stroller itself is also a little heavy to lift into the back of a car.In my opinion, you should really consider looking at a lightweight stroller that folds upright on it's wheels."
1,I am very upset that this is not the same product as on the pictures !,They sent me a cheap Chinese towels are not even where the label was not from where they took them! Label was cut becouse they do not wont to show people Chinese Different ITEM ! I ordered terracotta color but they send me yellow becouse they do not have terracotta color so why they show picture it`s so different ?
2,Just doesn't hold your attention,A quick page turner but just doesn't do it for me like maybe the first 100 pages of The Da Vinci COde or a Lawrence Block book. Disappointing.
3,Amusing and entertaining,"I first came across Donald Westlake's work in a recent Wall Street Journal article eulogizing his unfortunate passing earlier this year. Money For Nothing is the first of his books I've since read, and I'll definitely be searching out others at the local library.As another reviewer mentioned, I too can't get over the feeling Westlake treated this particular project as a personal challenge, attempting to throw everything but the kitchen sink in the protagonist's way, just to see if he could devise a plot which would lead the character to an appropriate conclusion. Regardless, the story starts fast, sparking intrigue from the very first page, and is well worth your time!Incidentally, if this book is indicative of his usual writing style, Westlake writes with an amazing clarity and at a level the typical teenager would easily be able to digest. If you're attempting to turn a son or daughter onto reading for leisure, Westlake's work might be a great place to begin."
1,Westlake Needs to Retire,I am a great admirer of Donald Westlake and his older works. The Dortmunder series is wonderful. But this novel had no depth and the storyline was weak. Hang it up and rest on your past works.
2,Unbelievable Plot,"Westlake took an unbelievable plot, but even then it might have worked had he not put two bumbling characters in the middle of it. If they were able to be witty, sarcastic and foolish, in the face of death. Then it made it hard for the reader to be too concerned over their fate."
2,Ho Hum...,"I'm just about done buying books from the bargain bookshelf by authors that I don't know. Everytime I do I seem to get something like this. Granted, out of my last 3 bargain books by unknown authors, this was the best. However, the competition wasn't very stiff.This book was slow, anti-climactic, mostly boring."
2,Money for Nothing...Indeed.,"What a disappointment. Westlake has some funny moments in this book, but I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. The premise is intriguing and the plot absurd. Often times, these capers can be fun, but not here. There is little character development and the plot is not even intriguing. The writing is simple and fast, but I did not really care what happened. I was bored by parts and glad to see it end. Westlake must be good--he has the awards to show for it--just not here."
3,Offbeat tale of a regular guy in a real jam.,"Ample and very entertaining cleverness is on display in the opening chapters of this book, as author Westlake constructs a truly imaginative yet believable scenario where an everyday middle-class New Yorker suddenly wakes up to find himself an undercover operative for a radical activist group from the Ukraine! Ample and very entertaining cleverness is also on display in the middle section, as our hero (the middle-class New Yorker) finds satisfying ways to regain a measure of control and turn the tables on his foreign handlers... for a time, anyway. The final chapters, alas, dispense with the ample and entertaining cleverness, but still deliver serviceable scenes of escape attempts, confrontation, and resolution. All in all, then, we end up with a pretty good thriller that is easily worth spending a couple of days reading on the porch or at the beach."
5,Great on Everything,"This seasoning has got to be the most awesome thing EVER! good on everything from soups to potatoes, but best on steaks! I havent used salt and pepper for prolly 10 years. Thanks Konriko, PS hire a marketing team and get this in some stores again!"
5,5 Stars in their price range,"I recently purchased a pair of these as a gift. Leupold has surprised me once again by besting everything I looked at in the price range of the Cascades - roughly up to $300. That included models from Steiner, Minox, Zeiss, Nikon, Bushnell, and several others. While Leupold's own Pinnacles are better - at twice the price - I have to say these compare very favorably.Ergonomically, the Cascades are wonderful: comfortable, fold-down eyecups, easy and effective diopter adjustment, precise focusing, good armour, comfortable to hold, and come with covers for both eyepiece and objective lenses. A decent strap and neoprene case are included. Optically, they are bright, well-aligned, crisp well out to the edges, and have good coatings. Viewing over long sessions does not tire the eyes."
5,No Spoiler-Simple Review,"Escaflowne is the one of the greatest masterpieces ever. And I mean ever. Everything is done right... from the plot, the characters, the originality, the beautiful music, everything. If you are into the fantasy genre, you have to check this out."
5,Escaflowne is a true anime masterpiece...,"The Vision of Escaflowne is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) anime series of all time. It combines action, drama, fantasy, romance, and many other elements to create this fascinating, thoughtful, and compelling tale. In addition to a superb storyline and expert character development, Escaflowne has an incredible musical score composed by Yoko Kanno. Performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus, the music in this series is truly remarkable, and can rank among the best in both the animated and live-action world. In short, The Vision of Escaflowne is a true anime masterpiece, and should not be overlooked.****(Although I would higly reccomend buying the DVD or at least getting to see the uncut Japanese version as well as the uncut dub!)"
1,"it's true, it won't work on a PS2","*sigh* I really hate it when companies are making a really great thing, then change it. If all you have is a PS2 don't even think of picking this up. Finish your Bebop collection instead or something. On a side note, they changed the casing too, and it's horrendous. Thinner casing, bad snap shut thingie, and it's harder to take out the DVD and put it away than just about any other DVD case. Why Bandai? What have I ever done unto thee...?"
1,ps2 not ther fault but dvd?,its not ps2 fault you see the ps2 has a dvd drive which reads all dvd codedid region 1 and all and ntsc brodcast not pal or secam its the manufactors fault recall some saying he could not get his to work some times on his dvd player and a other person said his worked fine on the ps2. or its posible that if a dvd does not bare a region marking that it wont play as said in the ps2 manual but neon genesis evangelion does not bare a region symbole and it works fine on the ps2. and the dvd i think must be silver not light gold agin as stated in the manual but ive had the same problem disc read error whith neon genesis evangelion 0:1 i think its one no region symbole two not silver but the other neon genesis evangelion dvd work 0:2-0:3 cause their silver on the bottom i think that the problem check the lens is it silver? or is the codeing the same?
1,Nesco pressure cooker in dumpster,"This was a great piece and I made many fine dishes with it.I was SO enthusiastic about it.Then it died after 6 months mid coq au vin romantic dinner.FIZZLE. NADA. DIALTONE.Please consider a mechanical pressure cooker with zero computer programs instead.It takes a little more effort to figure cooking strategies, but don't you want it to last generations?My Nesco is in a landfill now. Sadly, it was a wedding present."
4,Misleading description,Please be aware the unit doesn't come with a glass cover. Although it's on the internet site it's not in the manual or the box.
5,Easy to use,"Preformed as expected, and was easy to use, once I learned how to make sure the cover was properly closed before creating prussure.I liked the timer and the automatic cool down."
2,Nice Form - Horrible Function,"I got this as a gift for 25 years of service with my company. I loved using it for making rice and pressure cooking. Unfortunately, it lasted for about 10 - 12 uses, then inexplicably, it just died, right in the middle of heating a dish. No reason, just shut off. I've tried everything I can think of to get it working again, but no luck. I've let it set for a couple of days, I've plugged it into another outlet on another circuit, no dice. Like I said, it wasn't used that much and is in great physical shape.... it just refuses to work, and after reading up on it, I'm not ever going to waste my time trying to get Nesco to do the right thing.Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM NESCO PRODUCTS."
1,Nesco pressure cooker,do not recommend this item. Ist one arrived in pieces 2nd one would not work kept coming up with E4 on electronic screen. I called NESCO and they said it was a manufactures error code and would have to be returned. They said they did not know what it meant because the product is still too new. Maybe after they work out the bugs it would be better. Amazon has been great with the returns.
1,Loved it while it worked....,"I was absolutely in love with this pressure cooker. I was even going to buy one for several folks on my Christmas list.Then, in October, after five months of use, it died. I called the company and a delightful woman answered the phone and verified that the error message meant that it needed a new circuit board. She asked us to send it back to Nesco, which we did with RMA number and delivery confirmation receipt. Now two months later with no word at all, when we phone the company they have no idea where it is. They admit that they signed the delivery receipt. They have no idea where the cooker is. The nice lady once again answered the phone and promised to call us back right away after her investigation. That was last week and still no word.I would never buy a product from Nesco again. I am off to buy a new Pressure Cooker. I can't really live without it!"
3,Hard to release pressure,"Very messy when manually releasing pressure in a hurry, not good for adding stuff half way. Take quite some space on the counter. Controls are simple and nice, safe for old folks. Very quiet, but needs good planning to use it. Can't get use to it. Returning it to get a stainless stove top model to replace my old aluminum one."
4,Very good product,I've been using this product quite a bit since I got it. I'm still working to find receipes to prepare using the pressure cooking feature but so far it works great. My only concern about the unit is the selector valve on the top. You use the valve to choose pressure or steam and then to quick release the pressure. It's made of plastic and seems a bit flimsy. I haven't broken it yet.... That is the only part of the construction that seems suspect.
4,Wonderful Kitchen Addition! It Works!,"I purchased this pressure cooker after I bought an older house with older, tired kitchen appliances. The electric cook-top units are way to small to support a cook-top pressure cooker. I also want to cook and not use too much electricity.This modern electric pressure cooker is so quiet I thought for a moment it was a dud!No more CH! CH! CH! CH!I was able to let it do it's thing while I did something else in another part of the house.This is a pressure cooker for the 21st century. One of the advantages of this electric cooker is how LITTLE energy it uses. This is important with expensive electric and gas costs.I am very happy with my Nesco electric pressure cooker."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Our family has had a Nesco roaster in it for three generations so I was confident buying this product. It was wonderful to work with and a great time saver. However after just a little over a year and at the most using it 14 times, the digital readout freaked out and the whole thing quit. I have read of this happening in other reviews but could'nt believe it wasn't a isolated incident. Its not! Between the cost of shipping back and est. repair of 40-50 dollars (from Nesco customer service) I am going to buy the Cusinart model with a three year limited warranty. My mom is still cooking in the roaster she used when I was a little kid (40 years ago) Nesco shame on you - if you have a defective product, own up to it and service your customers instead of hoping the problem doesn't surface until the warranty is over."
4,Took 2 Adults to figure it out - needs better instructions,I gave this 4 stars because the illustrations and the instruction manual need some improvement. I have a Russell Hobb's pressure cooker that I have used for about 5 years and really love. I bought the Nesco to take to a vacation home we have. It came unassembled. I tried putting the rubber gasket in different positions to no avail. Could not get the lid to seal properly. My husband and I looked at the manual over and over again and were about ready to just bag the whole thing when he told me to try the gasket in one more different position and it worked. Thank Goodness.I took a picture of how it was positioned so we will remember where to place it the next time!
1,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,"PLEASE read the reviews that talk about the shoddy electronics going out! I was excited to get this unit and start cooking, I did the pressure test with water... check! I put in a chuck roast on ""brown"".... check! Then loaded up the other ingredients.... plugged it in and.... NOTHING! No lights, no beeps, NOTHING! I tried everything, pluged it into another outlet NOTHING! Unplugged it for 30 minutes, NOTHING! Then, in what I must say was horrible rage and disgust, nocked it off of the counter and dented it! So.... Please read the reviews that talk about the electronics!!! PLEASE. My cooker just became target practice... Don't let this happen to you, buy a different brand PLEASE."
1,Dented on arrival [FIXED],"I wish I could review this pressure cooker, but it arrived with a big dent in the side. Not due to shipping, by the way - either it came that way from the factory, or somebody else returned it and they turned around and shipped it out... I'll let you know when I get a replacement...EDITED 11 Apr...Amazon was very prompt in sending a replacement. Tried the new one last night - worked like a charm! I'm changing my rating to 4 stars. Only nit pick is that the steam release lever is too short - be a little careful when releasing pressure)."
1,Extremely short lived!,"I bought this cooker on December 6, 2007, which is less than two months ago. Initially it worked beautifully. Today, as I was using the browning feature... it died. Quit functioning completely. No, I didn't trip a breaker. It doesn't even light up.Probably I can get a refund, but it will be a royal pain, boxing it, sending it back to Amazon or Nesco. I'm very frustrated."
3,NESCO PC-6-25 3 in1cooker,"The NESCO 3 in 1 pressure cooker is performing up to specifications. I have no problem with it. However, in an attempt to find a replacment part for the gasket seal (the one item that would render the unit usless) I have contacted NESCO many times by email from their website and even a personal letter. They ignore me. They apparently DO NOT provide spare parts or will not quote on providing them."
5,"minutemen without D Boon, but some guy from ohio","We were all way into the minutemen in HS in Houston Tx, all 7 of us, in a school with 4000 kids. When this came out, we could not believe how good it was. It simply dumbfounded us. No D Boon, and this incredible disc? It was so minutemen, but different. On this tour, the guy ED from Ohio, had no musical background and played his guitar, poorly but earnestly.Mike W and GeorgH just watched him, half laughing at his Mel Bay guitar book chordplay. I wonder how the songs were written, if he brought fresh blood in to inspire these classics. IFN was almost as good, Flying the Flannel ok, and then they nosedived.This music was too early to capitalize on grunge, but bands like this one are why Kurt Cobain seemed embarassed to be credited as the one to 'break' punk rock, when so many did it before and way better than Nirvana. RIP D, Curt."
2,"Ok, but nothing like the other reviews.","The other reviews must be from band members and/or family, because it is just not all that. I previewed a couple songs at mp3raid.com and it was very amateurish."
3,Liquid Bandage Spray 4 Ounce,"Seems to work pretty well as a bandage, but so far it hasn't stopped or slowed down my dog from licking the wound, so it doesn't seem like the bitter taste slows him down."
2,may work pets wont stick to people,does not stick to peoples skin i was tired of paying 6 for 1 ounce ofnew skinspray google liquid bandage to find 3 ounce liquid bandage for 5 is better than buying 1 can per month of this product at cvs
1,Must pay a Mechanic to install,"Please read all the reviews carefully. You will notice that you must remove the interior paneling of the Toyota Sienna 2003. This is near impossible for an inexperienced person. Note that one review admitted that they took it to a mechanic friend. I have found no information on how to remove the paneling. To exaggerate to make a point: this being easy to install is like saying putting rings on your piston is easy, just remove the engine, remove the pistons and it snaps right on. This product is worth the money, it is just extremely difficult to install. After 4 attempts on the car and 5 attempts on the internet, I have still not found the information necessary to install."
2,Not what it says it is,"This product's desription is mis-leading. Let's look at the details:my comments are in ()s:T-Connectors allow you to connect your trailer's wiring system into your vehicle's wiring system (I never got this far)Prewired to provide right turn, left turn, taillight and on some models, the backup function (Again, who knows?)The two-piece system provides for a more versatile installation as well as a simple plug replacement option if the unit ever becomes damaged (Could be true, if you ever got it installed)Simple, 4 easy steps (not true, installation requires the removal of the complete rear interior panels)No cutting, soldering or taping (Again, this may be true - once you have taken the entire rear compartment interior out of the van)comments: This is not a ""4 easy steps"" installation"" at all. special tools are needed to remove interior panels without damage. Supplied instructions are useless. Over-all a complete waste of money."
5,EASY!!!,This was extremely easy to install and works fantastic! Couldn't have asked for an easier installation! The cable is flat enough that it fits under the rear hatch without getting pinched and is long enough that I am not concerned with corners.
4,Perfect Fit,"Getting all the trim off of the back of the Sienna was a bit of a trick, but the fittings on the product fit perfectly into thos of my van. Pretty cut and dry, just plug them in which is nice.I had trouble with one of my trailer lights not working, but I haven't had time to determine if it was the trailer wiring or the new product."
3,Spoofy,"I had seen this movie years ago, and decided to buy it when I discovered it on DVD. It is funny at spots, but not a laugh fest. Its humor is mostly based upon the absurd; somewhat like that of Green Acres. There is a host of possibilities in the basic premise of a large nuclear powered bus, and its colorful passengers. The first time you watch it, it will have you wondering what will happen next. If you have read the other reviews, you have a feel for the plot, so I won't go in to that again. Should you buy it? Well, if the price is right I would say yes. It isn't the kind of movie that you will watch often, but it is the kind of movie that will make you happy it is in your collection, so that when you want to watch it again, it is there."
4,a funny look at disaster movies,"this spoof of the disaster movies is very funny but a little slow in spots.it's the first run of mankinds greatest leap foward,the launch of the cyclops,the first atomic powered BUS????????and people want it to fail! very much like airplane(years before it) but a few to many misses to get 5 stars. still a lot of silly goofy fun,give it a try"
5,It does exist!!,"I told you there WAS a MOVIE called THE BIG BUS, but you didn't believe me. Why? Why? Why? You laughed at me.....You made me cry. There was a bowling alley in the bus. That was cool. Really. Cool."
4,A Spoof that Should Have Worked,"Like the ""Airplane!"" films that succeeded it, ""The Big Bus"" is hilarious parody of the oh-so-popular disaster flicks of the 1970's. It is really like a disaster film as seen through the eyes of Tex Avery, the master animator who threw everything into his 'toons, including the kitchen sink at the expense of some poor soul.""Bus"" features a superb cast of movie and television performers who mimic every big name actor featured in bigger budgeted extravaganzas like ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" and ""Earthquake.""In the words of Spike Lee, one must ""get on this bus"" for a fun-filled ride."
3,The Big Bus VHS,"This is a very funny movie if one likes goofy comedy as our family does.However, I've never seen a good VHS copy and I've seen several. All of them had bad sound and not so good quality picture. We recently bought a DVD and it is much, much better."
1,DVD out of print???,"Gee Paramount- thanks for taking the DVD out of print (along with lots of your other titles) but allowing us to still 'buy' it from Amazon VOD, which we can watch in lower-than-DVD quality on 'registered devices'. That's SO much better than a pesky disc taking up space on my shelf."
3,Have you seen Airplane?,"I didn't expect it to be great. I have a ""nuclear movie collection"" and I had to have this one. The Big Bus is a lot like Airplane. It's dumb humor. Anyone in the nuclear field would probably get a kick out of the technical ""points"" but other than that the movie sucks. I got the humor from the technical points."
5,Psychedelic rock doesn't get any better than this!,"One of my all-time favorite albums. This is a psychedelic acid-drenched joy ride of a collection; a true gem in the late '80s SST catalog. Better than anything Kendra Smith did solo and better by far than anything Dan Roback did with Mazzy Star, this is a slow fuse burning and burning and burning thru the night. Happy Nightmare Baby, Rocket Machine and Magick Power are tracks I could never forget and never get tired of hearing."
4,excllent,"Nice little band I got hip to, twenty years after the fact.Someone gave me their copy after storing it on their hard drive. Opal sounds a little like Physical Graffiti Led Zeppelin with its middle eastern shadings. But Opal dispenses with the heavy production of Jimmy Page. This music is both exotic and punky, with enough sophistication to keep a listener engaged."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Rain Parade, Mazzy Star. In fact, I had ""Early Recordings"" when I was in college and thought it was great. This CD is very disappointing. The sound quality is very bad - it sounds like it was recording in a bathroom. A recording of a recording of a recording. Very muddy and unclear..."
3,Get the 1st album (if you can find it!),"Although ""Happy Nightmare"" has a couple of compelling tracks on it, the band's true masterwork was their debut album. ""Northern Line"" and ""Harriet Brown"" are as hauntingly beautiful as anything I've ever heard. We had the LP at my college radio station in the 80's, and it took me 2 years to find a copy of the CD through one of those rare/out-of-print search services in ""Goldmine"" magazine. It was worth it. Next to that record, nothing on the 2nd album or by Mazzy Star even comes close."
4,Talk thru the Bible,"This book is exactly what I needed for my women's Bible study. It's very helpful and informative. There are a few notes written in it from the previous owner, but most of those were written in pencil and are easily erased. Thank you for the prompt shipping!"
2,Already have a study bible?,"If you already have a ""Study"" bible - meaning you have an introduction to each book that talks about when written, who wrote it, the theme, an outline, etc.... then you DO NOT NEED THIS BOOK. It adds very little/nothing to what you have in a standard, e.g. NIV study bible."
2,old,"Pretty old school. There are so man new ""Jewish"" names, and this book pretty much covered the obvious."
2,Jewish First Names,The author was too selective as to the names that were included in this book. Many of the names I was researching were not included.
5,Pendulum . . . by Jack Carpenter,"I have read a lot of books about early aviation and especially Glenn Curtiss, and Mr. Carpenter's book is among the best. It has been very helpful to me to put the entire chronology of the Wright brothers and Curtis and the development of flight in perspective because of the way he organizes his information. This book is most helpful when read AFTER a Curtiss biography, such as Roseberry's book on Curtiss."
2,Who to remember? Ruchira Avatar Adi Da Samraj!,"I bought this book because of rave reviews by a ""parent"" and a ""therapist"" and a follower of Ruchira Avatar. Research shows me that they are all the same person. ""They"" correctly point out that the book is beautifully illustrated and includes important thoughts on life and death to share with children. However, the word ""Who"" in the title is the only word underlined, and the one to turn one's attention to in order to be happy is the author. I was under the first impression that it was Buddhism or Zen for children, but the ego of the author is all too present."
1,Very bizarre,"Some interesting and spiritually grounded points are made, but ultimately, the book compels children, in no uncertain terms to worship the author. That's far beyond the realm of a spiritual book for me - that make it a tool of the author's religion, which I respect but do not have any desire to share with my children. If you follow Adidam, Adi Da Shamraj's religion, you will appreciate this... otherwise, be cautious."
3,A little weird...,"First, let me say that I am very open-minded and enjoy spiritual diversity and religious pluralism. That said, this book is a little bit weird. Some of the concepts are so abstract they could be challenging for some adults to grasp, and I think children might struggle with the ideas. Also, the last two pages are just worthless, in my opinion, unless the author happens to be your guru. He says that ""you should constantly forget about yourself and think only of Me."" If you substitute ""Me"" for ""God"" or the ""Spirit,"" it is a fine image. But unless you are one of his followers, you probably do not believe that the author is a full incarnation of God, so in that sense, it's a bit weird. I wouldn't buy it again, but there is some good in it, so I will just focus on that."
4,Looks like emo. Sounds like... The Smiths?,"Some bands are really good at hiding their influences. Some bands shut themselves up from all outside music while they write and record their music, so that nothing seeps in. Rarely can you, upon first listen, know exactly what artist was stuck on repeat on every single member of the bands iPod. ""I Want To Be Buried In Your Backyard"" is definitely one of those songs. From start to finish, it has The Smiths written all over it, with more to spare! Just when I thought it didn't get anymore obvious after hearing ""The Dears"". ""Nightmare of You"" however, tops even that. Don't get me wrong sounding exactly like Morrissey or The Smiths would with an emo sounding singer is actually more enjoyable than one would imagine. It's very refreshing to hear a band that by all appearances and history should be hardcore, and yet has a distortion deprived mix. Not many bands can pull off the whole emo look with 80's pop sound. Hats off."
3,Arduous Pallor?,"Nightmare of You has put out a grand introductory album.While some reviewers may frown on the album because of its amateur composition the rest of us (i.e. those not intending to use the album as a Berklee course outline) can appreciate Nightmare of You's self titled album for what it is, specifically, a fun, infectious album.Unfortunately, I cannot give this album the four stars that it otherwise deserves until I figure out how one can ""travel shore to shore/ in such arduous pallor."" That doesn't even make sense--figuratively, literally, emotionally, symbolically, existentially--THOSE WORDS DO NOT GO TOGETHER!"
4,"Catchy, Quirky Tunes","Nightmare of You by Nightmare of You is catchy. I haven't listened to the album in months and I can still hum the songs.Positives: Did I mention this album is catchy? My Name is Trouble is one of those songs that I have to dance to. When the lyrics are at their most cheeky they're loads of fun.Negatives: the album feels unfocused, like the band hasn't yet found their own musical or lyrical voice. Some of the lyrics are creepy and I'm not quite sure how I feel happily singing along to them if I'm not paying attention to what they are actually saying.Definitely a good early album from a band I hope we hear more of in the future.***1/2 Stars"
1,Worse Movie EVER,"They should not have released this garbage until they wrote a script for the film! There is no substance, just one computer animated fight scene after another and a couple of gratuitous sex scenes. Total waste of time and money."
5,Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War,Great book - Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of Warif you like history!!! I was a member of the Officers Club that Boyd and his team met at. I never got to meet this genius - wish I had. The book is great and I have bought other books about Boyd's theories.
5,A Quick and Dirty Review,"I read a number of the one star reviews before reading this book, and almost didn't; in the end I took a chance - and am glad I did. The book isn't only about how Boyd saved the F-16, or the debate over guns vs. missiles in the 1960s/70s. It's about someone who took on a corrupt system, and there is NO debate about how corrupt a system it was, and it is damn well written. Well done, Coram.I wish John Boyd were still alive today."
5,Read this book!,"An excellent book even for those who were not in the Air Force like myself. Interesting view of the inner workings of the R&D part of the Air Force. Unusual individual. I can see why he did not fit into the mold of what the Air Force wanted as a career officer. It can get a bit technical in spots, but a good read anyway."
5,An insight to military thinking from battlefield tactics to acquistion strategy,"When you read this book you are getting much, much more than the story of one man. This is an insider's guide to military air tactics, DoD bureaucracy, and weapons system acquisition. As a retired Naval Aviator, and Defense engineer working on weapons systems, I found this book to be extraordinarily enlightening. I plan to give several copies to friends of mine in the active-duty Navy and civilian defense industry. This book should be on every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine's bookshelf."
2,Disappointing,"Boyd was obviously a genius in some ways, but the book paints him as all-knowing about everything regarding warfare. You get the feeling that anyone who disagreed with him was stupid or crooked.Imagine how effective he could have been, if he wasn't such a jerk.Imagine how much better the book could have been, if it wasn't a ""Boyd Fan Club"" publication.And his nearly complete disregard of his family, borders on criminal.I'm glad he was on our side.I'm glad I never had to work with him."
5,Why don't we know of Boyd?,"Once I started this book, I could barely put it down - Who was John Boyd, and why didn't I know of him? As a former US Air Force fighter pilot with a degree in Aero Ed, I'm familiar with energy-maneuverability diagrams, but never learned who created them.Today, as I watch the news of the war in Iraq, I'm amazed at the skill, speed and tactics of the US Military, John Boyd was the man responsible for our sucess.Finally, the OODA Loop will quantify my consulting business - getting into my competitions decision time!"
1,"Ooof, this book sucked.","This was a really awful book. What an unpleasent, uninspiring ego-maniac.... Reminds me of ""About Face"" another awful book. Save your time, read ""I Could Never be So Lucky Again."""
4,"If national defense is a concern to you, Boyd is a must.","One word keeps popping up in my mind as I read this book: unvarnished. An insider tells us important things we rarely know, a brainy and gnarly insider striving throughout to get it straight and true.Boyd's story is not only prologue but guide to how we even today make major mistakes when we try to acquire the best possible defenses. Even the brainiest and brightest often get it wrong.Analysts today should have this book as a basic reference on their shelves."
1,Hero worship should be left to comic books,"Having been in the Air Force during the Vietnam era, and having served at the command level, I found this book to be rather insulting. I served with many fine staff officers, and flag officers, who were trying their very best to do what was right for this country and the Air Force. To try to lump these fine individuals into Robert Coram's classification of ""Blue Suiters"" is repugnant to me at the best.The book is long, boring, repetitive and somewhat poorly written. As an Air Force veteran I have great difficulty finding John Boyd the savior of the Air Force and the country. Hero worship should be left to comic books."
5,A rivetting read from start to finish,"I just chanced upon this book in Boders while visiting Penang recently and was pretty much riveted from the moment I picked it up to the moment I finished it, about 3 and a half days later. It is really an intriguing and gripping read and the life of this extraordinary man is certainly worth studying. The author (Robert Coram) is clearly fascinated with his subject and brings his passion to bear on this work of modern historical writing. The only fault I can find is that, as a piece of historical scholarship, it should have been much more diligently and thoroughly footnoted, which could have been done without reducing the book's excitement or the ease with which it can be read. I definitely will buy multiple copies of the book and hand it around to my friends."
4,First Directorate,I've been researching spying in the Cold War for a couple of months and have read many books on the subject. First Directorate is one of the best. It describes the experiences of Oleg Kalugin who was the Soviet Chief of Counterintellignce in the 80s. He had a long career with many interesting experiences. Some of the things that he did are surprising. By reading this book you will gain a good understanding of how the KGB operated during the Cold War and a good persective of the Cold War from the point of view of a Russian.
1,worst game ever,"Could this possibly be the worst adventure game ever?Granted I did'nt finish it but who would want to.Clumsy game controls(you use the keyboard not the mouse)terrible character animation no soundtrack music whatsover to set the scenes.If you wat to buy a real adventure game buy ""The Longest Journey"".This just stinks."
1,The most most ... game ever!,"This game ... The graphics are two years old, the camera always will stop, then close up, and then when you get far away again, it stops again, and then close's up. The voices stutter no matter what( during insstalation it alerts you of this, but you have to intstall another 150 megabites.) I did this, and it didn't work. Did it again still didn't work."
4,Much better than expected,"Actually found it was much better than expected. Let me admit I am a Leslie Nielsen fan, however, even then some of his films are a bit on the ridiculous side. This actually had something of a plot. It was a bit less silly than most of his films, having him play a harder-edged character than usual.Not sure where they came up with the cover. Rather unrelated to the movie. Obviously not an Oscar caliber movie, but worth kicking back and enjoying on a free evening."
3,MILDLY ENTERTAINING,"Leslie Nielsen has certainly given us some funny movies, look at the Naked Gun series..and his foray into comedy after years of serious roles certainly endeared him to those of us who like our comedy a little corny and offbeat. However, as years have gone by, Nielsen has merely called in performances in some really impotent comedies, this one included. Blame director James Keach for some of it; his pacing is so slow, it can't come anywhere near the airplane and naked gun movies. While I have admired Lochlyn Munro's performances in some recent films (the Scary Movie ripoffs, Blacktop), he doesn't possess the comic verve necessary to carry the weight of this movie. William Forsythe does well with his sheriff role, but Vanessa Angel (from ""Sabertooth"") continues to perform like a high school thespian. The laughs are there, but they are far and few between."
4,Best on the market,"This is not simply the Franklin 1470 in a different container, as one commenter claims. The 1470 contains the Merriam-Webster Spanish Dictionary, while this contains the Larousse Concise Spanish English Dictionary, which is much better.This is by far the best electronic Spanish-English dictionary on the market at the moment and worth the extra bucks. My only complaint is that when using the Merriam-Webster English dictionary, which is also on this unit, it automatically switches back to the Larousse dictionary after switching off, instead of remaining where is was between shutoffs. That's annoying if want to keep using the English dictionary. However, if you use a Bookman card, it returns to that after shutoffs as it should."
2,underpowered,"Although the Larousse dictionary is very good, the user interface for this product leaves much to be desired. Getting from one function to another is cumbersome, involving many non intuitive button presses. The translator/dictionary is also very slow and would benefit from an upgrade in processing speed. I would not recommend this product."
3,good dictionary but.............,"I've had several Franklin translators and have had varying degrees of luck with them. I did my research before I bought this one and although I was concerned about the lack of a back light feature, I bought it anyway.After several months I am experiencing intermittant power failure, which every time wipes my word list memory and yes, the screen really needs a backlight. I can't think why they would omit this given that it came with previous models. Also, of course the flip cover is a joke and has long since disappeared. This is a pocket translator after all but consistently fails to deal with the rigors of pocket life!However on the positive side, I have to say that the Larousse dictionary is excellent. It's very thorough, it includes many useful related phrases and it is not at all prudish.For me Franklin seems to have the software down pat but cannot come up with rugged enough hardware to make a great translator."
3,DVR not DVD,Be aware that this is NOT a studio release but a DVR copy. It has nice packaging and the use of the 20th Century Fox logo used in their recent DVD releases is a nice touch. If you like the movie and want it in this format rather than a used VHS that's your call but buyer should be informed beforehand. You are getting an unrestored dub off a VHS with all the soft edges and washed out colors.
2,Great movie bad copy,"Terrible copy of a great movie , had to watch it on my computer wouldn't play on my BluRay worse than and old VHS tape."
2,unused,i could not download this item so i cant rate it.i also took and deleted it off my videos and did not watch it
5,Great addition to my collection!,I love Christmas books and this is a beautiful addition. Andrew Greeley is a first class author! You won't be disappointed.
5,Star Bright; A Christmas Story,"I have read this book many times and I like it better each time, it tells about Christmas like it should be."
2,Same old same old from Father Greeley,"I got the impression that this book was something the publishers asked Father Greeley to dash off in time for Christmas. Same Irish-American hero from Chicago with large family, same strong heroine that said hero worships. Yawn. At least she was Russian this time; that added a bit of interest to the story. Don't get me wrong, I've read all of Greeley's fiction, am a big fan. It's usually much more interesting, with actual plots and villains and such. This was just a bland little holiday story."
2,Star Bright: A Christmas Story,Did not like this book. It is not up to the standard I usually read from Andrew Greeley.
5,Truly wonderful!,"I was listening to the tape one night when I was in the midst of a crisis with my health. As I listened, I brought my full intention to Ron's words, praying for a direct experience of the holy spirit. I suddenly became aware of a very large bright light expanding outward from my heart. It lasted about 4 seconds. I felt this remarkable feeling of warmth, comfort and peace that did not take away my problems but soothed me and made me feel like everything *was* alright. If anyone is looking for a way to bring the holy spirit directly into their experience, I highly recommend this book. Ron Roth is such a strong conduit for the message that the holy spirit is there for us to experience, we just need to get out of the way (I am obviously a work in progress in this regard). Blessings to all."
1,BEWARE!!!,THERE IS ONLY ONE BRUSH DISPITE THE PICTURE SHOWING SEVERAL!IT DOES SAY BRUSH BUT THE PICTURE IS MISLEADING.
5,Very helpful when dealing with grief at any age,"I wish that I had this book available when I lost my father at 15. I recently lost my mom and reading this book, even as an adult, helped me grasp and get a hold of my emotions of pain and loss. There is nothing more honest than looking at grief from the eyes of children. I would recommend to have this book handy if you have living parents or if you are a parent as we all have to deal with death at some point in our lives."
5,They are Wolf Parade and they love to entertain.,Jump on the Canada bandwagon. These guys rock. If you like Modest Mouse you probably already know about them. The keyboard/singer has a killer stache.
1,I don't get it...,"Isaac Brock's attempt to pass the mic to this group of Canadian hopefuls has resulted in two things: A. another singer that sings with a lisp and, B. failure to come up with anything original. Arcade Fire? THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN??? Not even close. Do yourself a favor, save your scratch and become a Gary Numan fan instead."
2,THias is BAD,"badly produced, low quality, garbage is all this album is. its definetly not worth your money. and as for being up there with the arcade fire, not a CHANCE. just another, indie overrated band who are never gonna make good listenable music."
2,Been there...heard that...,I'll go ahead and admit that i haven't heard this album completely (just listened to the samples) but from what I have heard this seems to be a disposable album. While the songs sound decent there is nothing new here. I already love Modest Mouse as well as Frog Eyes and the music here seems to be a copy of both bands. Stick with the original bands who created this style and forget about this one.
3,Between competent and compliment,"Promising debut of frazzled indie rock, clearly mining the vein compatriots Arcade Fire ripped open, doesn't quite have the melodic staying power to burn more than a few numbers into the brain."
4,Stop with all the comparisions people,"Stop the madness! Wolf Parade vs. Arcade Fire vs. Modest Mouse vs. Tom Waits vs. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah vs. Wilco vs. Bloc Party vs. The Decemberist vs. M Ward vs. Franz Ferdinand vs. everything else you can imagine. Oh yeah, and Dan Bejar sounds like David Bowie, and George Bush is Einstein.Wolf Parade is a fine album. Listen to it and decide for yourself; they sound like Clay Aiken eating a doughnut in France on a Wednesday in spring on a park bench next to an old lady with a blue hat who smells musty."
4,Quirky and pleasant,"Wolf Parade hails from Canada, and their sound reminds me somewhat of that other Canadian band Hot Hot Heat, with heavy reliance on assorded keyboards and synths, and slightly off-center singing.""Apologies to the Queen Mary"" is the band's debut album, after having released a couple of EPs. The album starts off strongly with ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son"", and the song is as off-beat as its title suggests. Other highlights include ""Shine a Light"" (those 2 songs appeared also on the EP released just before the album), ""Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts"", and the slower tunes ""I'll Believe In Anything"" and ""Dinner Bells"", the latter a 7 min. mini-epic of sorts, but very nice.It's pretty clear to whom this album will appeal greatly: if you linke indie-alterna-rock, this is for you. Fans of bands like Hot Hot Heat, Aqueduct, etc. will eat this up. Whether Wolf Parade can break into bigger success remains to be seen. But this is a fun debut album."
4,What...? frank Black is back?!,"What the heck? I'll tell you what, these guys are what The Pixies would be if they had never taken a hiatus...or aged. The vocals are reminiscent of Frank Black-like whoops, screeches and on the edge intensity. Then again, on ""We Built Another World,"" they seem to say, ""Sorry chiefs, but we're our own band. But, thanks for putting us under the influence!"""
3,Had a hard time processing it... Can't get past Krug's singing,"I loved most of the music delivered by this Canadian band, but every time Spencer Krug starts to sing, I find it to be a real turn-off: with all due respect, it sounds more like moaning than singing.I have given it a shot many times, and every single time I end up skipping the tracks where he sings. So, accounting for the music, I am giving the album 3 stars, but Krug's singing looses them a full two stars."
4,Good Tunes,"I like this album. My only thing is that the songs that are hits on this album are the best songs, and there's only 3 or 4 of those. They rocked, but the whole album isn't solid. I would still buy this cd over and over though."
5,Good New Music,1) Take a listen all the way through.2) Repeat.3) Stop listening to what the media says and enjoy some good new music4) Go see them live and you will realize these guys are for real
4,"Enjoyable, quirky indie rock","This is a pretty solid album and ""Shine a Light"" & ""We Built Another World"" & ""Fancy Claps"" are really great songs. There are two alternating lead singers which are both good. They are talented musicians and seem to have a lot of interesting ideas musically, & have a likeable quirkiness to them.I actually came to amazon looking for a follow up disc from Wolf Parade, hopefully there will be one soon!"
3,Almost from Scratch,This book looks very interesting and should be a big help for my family. I look forward to trying the recipes
5,great!,I was so glad to find these. I couldnt find them in the store and buying from the website they wanted over $15 bucks for one. Thsi saved my vacuum and my wallet!
1,Poor Quality!,"My earlier comment on quality - again, poor quality material led to these belts bursting after a single use of the equipment.Get the manufacturers recommended belts."
5,Worked as intended,"Was shipped fast, fit correctly, there were two belts in the bag and it was still extremely cheap. What more could you ask for?"
3,DIRT DEVIL ACCESSORIES,"Product as described and a good deal, however, tried to cancel due to wrong delivery address but was not cancelled and I bought twice what I wanted."
3,informative but a bit dry,"good read overall, but i had a hard time turning the pages of the book. full of facts and at times reads like sterio instructions. recommend it for hardcore enthusiasts of the genre, but if not skip it and get the civil war narrative from shelby foote, much better reading."
5,Battle Cry of Freedom is great!,I have always heard about this classic book about the Civil War. It is everything I have heard. The author is very detailed but he does it in a way that is not boring. Excellent book!
2,Wonderful Book!,"This is the greatest book ever written on the Civil War. It is accurate in every detail, yet manages to fit this enormously complicated conflict into a single easy-to-read volume!"
2,Battle Cry of Freedom,"It arrived as advertised, except it was touted as being a book celebrating the 150 yr. Anniversary of the Civil War. I thought it would be a new book about the Civil War, but it's not. It's last Copyright is 1988, so I'm really disappointed. I would rather send this back, and see if it comes in a Kindle version, because there are very few pictures, which is disappointing as well."
3,VERY TEDIOUS READING...,"I GUESS YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE A CIVIL WAR BUFF TO READ THIS HUGE SAGA. I AM READING THIS FOR A COURSE, NOT FOR PERSONAL INTEREST AND I JUST CAN'T GET PAST PAGE 50. IN TERMS OF REVIEWING THIS BOOK AS A TEXTBOOK, THERE IS NO TIMELINE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SKIM THROUGH THE UNNECESSARY DETAILS. FOR STUDENTS, ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS BOOK WOULD BE HELPFUL, ALONG WITH A TIMELINE. WE DON'T NEED UNNECESSARY DETAILS, AND THE CIVIL WAR IS NOT AS INTERESTING AS, SAY WESTERN CIV, AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE 1,100 PAGES I READ. I WAS RECOMMENDED BROOKS D. SIMPSONS BOOK, ""AMERICA'S CIVIL WAR,"" WHICH I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING BECAUSE SUPPOSEDLY IT IS MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND HAS 200 PAGES."
1,Go read Shelby Foote,"If you wish to read the account of the American tragedy from a true historian, and not a socialist mutt, pick up Shelby Foote's brilliant, un-PC, 3 volume set. There's really nothing else to say. James McPherson is to history as Lenin is to Russian peasants...........a butcher!"
1,ugly american book,"Just another detailed selective researched bash america book,take a few writers and paint both sides ugly in a left handed way.Slavery existed then and still exist`s today in to many countries around the world do you realy think ten percent of all Northern males 20-45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18-40 died not counting casulties did this for slaves (how simple minded)it was what all civil wars are fought for power and control of whatever view of the future they had for themselves and their children.Slavery was an axe to grind for control of the gov. same as today who gets special favors,taxes,ect.So if you are of a bent to the ugly american side this is a book for you.By the way after 200 pages i deleted from my kindle."
1,My thoughts on Battle Cry of Freedom,"This is the most boring book.. It will only be read by those younger than 40 through assignment or forced torture. *AHS* vIf I could give it a negative 500 stars... which would be inverted stars like something squashed, I'd give it to this book!"
5,The war was all about feudal vs nation-state power,"Feudal nations that carried over in that era would have completely sided with the South, realizing that equality of all citizens means the lessening of privilege for the wealthy agrarian section of society. All present day nation states would completely agree with the Lincoln doctrine so eloquently expressed in this book, that of ""popular sovereignity"".I find this book to be very engaging and not tedious even though it is huge! I would highly recommend it and would urge folks to read the chapters before the war even came about. The compromise of 1850 is not that well known and is worth the read."
5,History as it should be told,"The opening lines of th is work on the civil war are the following sentences: ""On the morning of September 14, 1847, brilliant sunshine burned off the haze in Mexico City. A mild breeze sprang up to blow away the smell of gunpowder lingering from the bloody battle of Capultepec. Unshaven, mudstained soldiers of the United States ... (p.3). In moving, often dramatic and empathic prose, James McPherson has written a simply wonderful work of history. From the ""novel-like"" first lines to the closing chapter, McPherson delivers solid, scholarly work with a grace and a style that lulls the reader into thinking he or she is reading a work of fiction. It is perhaps, one of the best comprehensive works on the Civil War, (and the Civil War era) not only for its depth and scholarly attention to detail, but for its expansive readability. 900-plus pages, and it IS a page-turner. Highly recommended."
5,Complete and encompassing,Most complete and encompassing Civil War era tome written. McPherson expertly details each event by first laying the foundation so that every detail can be understood in it's context.
4,A Very Informative Book,"Have not yet finished this book; however, what I've read so far is outstanding. I'm amazed at the similarity between today's politics and the politics of the Civil War Era. I've read a great deal about the Civil War through the years...this is the most interesting one by far."
5,Great book,There is a reason the author won a Pulitzer prize for this book. It is an amazingly well written civil war book.
5,This book is great!,"The Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of The United States) is a great piece of American Slavery history book, because it gives actual facts about what happened, where it happened, when it happened and how it happened by real accounts from historical records. The author reveals more about slavery in its early times and late times about why it existed. I had to study this book for a college history, which made complete sense as to why it happened and why the Civil War took place as it did. If you are a history in the field of American Studies, especially about Slavery In America. I recommend this book to be on your A-list. I love my copy of this book, because I am historian with a degree in History and Political Science, which this book totally ties in, which I teach my History to students about Slavery In America. I am also the Author of Adrian & Jade In Queen Lara Vega's Secret Roses Volume 1."
2,McPherson takes the easy way out and sides with his own bias,"James McPherson did an admirable job compiling a wealth of information and presenting it in the early stages of ""Battle Cry of Freedom,"" then dismissed with a wave of his pen to embark upon an anti-Southern crusade. He fell back upon the old trick of painting the Confederate Army as a sea of amorphous white faces, devoid of racial or ethnic diversity. He tiptoed around the thousands of African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and the multiple immigrant groups who joined the Confederate Army and fought side-by-side. Where did he document the Emerald Guard, the Mobile German Fusiliers, the 1st Choctaw (or the other 28 tribes who fought in gray), or the Spanish Legion? This book is awash with personal antipathy and politically correct revisionist historical claptrap."
3,"Good, but biased","McPherson gives a good history of the war, but his opinions are evident. This professor is a strong Unionist, staunchly supports the idea that slavery was the cornerstone for the war, and has denied fact-based evidence of black Confederate soldiers. Worth reading but don't use it as your sole resource"
2,You'll Cry If You Don't Like Politics,"If you a political fanatic and Civil War buff well then this book is for you. Personally, I am not into politics so that portion of the book was not for me. It took over 300 pages to finally get to the first battle of the civil war, The Battle of Bull Run. Everything up to that point was ladened with hard core political reasons as to why the civil war was fought."
5,US BLOODIEST WAR EXPLAINED WITH GREAT CLARITY,"More American soldiers died in this war THAN IN ALL OF OUR OTHER WARS COMBINED! The total is over 600,000!. This does not include civilian casualties.This is the most important war in US history, and McPherson's book is a very valuable contribution to its record. This book explores the causes, battles and conclusion. It is a highly readable story, told with such finesse that you almost feel that you don't know how it will come out.I especially like the way McPherson points out areas of deep controversy and analyses them. Also very interesting are the changing attitudes beginning with a war to perserve the Union and ending with the 13th Amendment.The amazing thing about this book is that after 130 years, the issues are still relevant, the material fresh, and the importance of this to our own lives, vital."
5,Great single volume narrative on the Civil War,"This is a fantastic single volume history of the Civil War, and a pretty quick read. Highly recommended."
5,extremely informative,"Connects the dots on how the Mexican-American War, the subsequent opening of the remaining western territories and the overwhelming question of whether they would become free or slave states seemed to make the Civil War inevitable. However while it then seems the war WAS about slavery more than states rights the author shows the deeper fear (paranoia) the South had about losing their agrarian way of life (which of course included slavery)to the rapidly expanding industrial revolution and it's ""worker class""."
5,Great Overview of a Complex War,"Having read many civil war books and by no means an authority on the subject of the civil war ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" is a great read for an overview of the subject.But I must state from having also read Allan Nevins 8 volume set and Shelby Foote's three volume masterpiece of the civil war that if one is truly interested in the fine print and specifics of the war these works must also be read.Each author has their own style and content which is different in each writing. These authors James McPherson, Allan Nevins, Shelby Foote, Douglas Freeman and many others make the subject of the civil war just one outstanding discipline to study.Have enjoyed it over the years and intend to continue this pursuit of knowledge in this area."
4,Battle Cry of Freedom,"This is a very good general history of the Civil War in one book. It is easy reading. Do not get this book if you are looking for great depth of history on the War. But if you are a novice enthusiast of the Civil War, this is a great book to read. It will give you a good base of knowledge to build upon."
4,Great description of the Civil war,"Lengthy and somewhat difficult read, but you won't be left wanting for facts surrounding this dark time in US history. Great to read before seeing Lincoln the movie."
5,Civil War Buffs: Read This Book First,"I saw a newspaper article where 10 Civil War scholars were asked to list the best books on the Civil War. 'Battle Cry of Freedom' was one of the only books to show up on multiple lists. I researched the book further, and found out it won the Pulitzer. How could I go wrong with this book?I bought it, and started reading it. It was exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't as tedious and solely military oriented as some of the other Civil War books I had started in the past and never finished. Finishing the book a while later, after reading 2-4 chapters a night, I realized even more what a great read it was. This book covers economical, political, military, and social aspects of the war.For anyone wanting to study the Civil War, read this book first. It is a well-researched, perfect introduction to the subject. I wish a book like this existed for every major historical event - it would make life as an armchair historian much more pleasant."
2,Kindle Edition has problems,This review is purely as to the flaws of the Kindle transfer -- the book itself is a masterpiece I've reread with pleasure on paper over the years. Unfortunately the transfer is a rough scanned-PDF type that is MUCH harder to read than other Kindle books. Caveat Emptor.
4,Extremely valuable,"I can't imagine someone doing a better job with that subject matter than McPherson. He covered all the important events and policies that led to the Civil War, going back to war with Mexico, and he provided a great history of the Civil War era that is sure to turn readers into Civil War buffs who will seek out more books on the time period. Because there is so much information packed into these 800-plus pages, it was not a remarkably quick read; everything is so important, it's hard to breeze along. But his style of writing is outstanding, mixing in humor and emphasizing the right points. It was very valuable for me."
4,Incredibly well written and very deserving of the Pulitzer,"It is almost as good as Shelby Foote's excellent three volume epic on The Civil War.Unfortunately, I cannot give Battle Cry that fifth star no matter how good the writing. If there is one thing I love in historical works, it is objectivity. James McPherson has none. He is yet another ""slavery is the cause"" historians who ignore obvious facts and evidence to the contrary. Several times throughout Battle Cry he states as fact, slavery was the cause, without even acknowledging the other evidence. Unacceptable."
3,good deal for the $$,"I'm glad this item didn't cost too much. It was a very last minute purchase, and it turned out okay! I was glad it looked a little nicer in person than it does online. It's better than paying $50 on etsy!!"
3,A little boring,"There is certainly some great information in here, but the tone of the book is very academic/wordy and isn't really a page-turner. The book doesn't really flow perfectly from cover to cover and was boring for me, personally, but there definitely is plenty of good subject material inside."
5,OUTSTANDING,I think these sheets are outstanding. I don't think I can ever go back to the 200 or 300 TC sheets. I also purchased these for my mother and she loves them.
5,very soft and cozy,These sheets feel delicious on your skin ~ you will love them ~I have washed them on the gentle cycle with woolite and lots of sofner to keep them perfect ~ they are my favorite of all time!
4,Intriguing Look at a Hapa Life,"I enjoyed Paper Bullets immensely. Kip Fulbeck's writing is real, forthright, honest, and nothing short of entertaining. His humorous moments of the pitfalls of dating for multiracial people struck a very strong chord with me, and while his vignette about a teenaged relationship gone wrong was a little overarching, its realism and painful admission guaranteed its success in the overall collection."
1,Drowning in a Sea of Narcissism,"In the final pages of his ""fictional autobiography,"" author Kip Fulbeck writes of his gift for putting words on paper. This single line speaks volumes, but as Narcissus drowned from staring at his reflection, so too does this writer. Sadly, the reader is the real victim. If I were imitating Fulbeck I would spend the remainder of this short review wringing this analogy dry. There are some clever ideas, but Fulbeck is too in love with his own wit to let anything stand. Every metaphor is taken too far, and the result is a book that become tedious and frustratingly annoying. The character (Fulbeck?) soon reveals himself to be a person you would not want to know, despite his constant reminders of how talented, good-looking, and accomplished he is. Interestingly, Fulbeck seems to have spent a lifetime being disappointed in the people around him, who never live up to his own standards. He himself, he reveals too often, is nearly flawless."
1,psycho man meets neurotic man,"Read the reviews and checked out the book. What's wrong with the narrator? Since this is a ""fictional"" biography, the narrator can wiggle his way in and out of funky --I mean, funky situations. I sense a neurotic writer who is probably insecure and a bit on the ""edge"" (not cutting edge, but psycho-edge), who used this book as therapy. Yeah, the writer intrigues at a real elementary, base level. . . The hapa is represented in such a pathetic way, I was wondering if Fulbeck was resurrecting the tragic, neurotic,psycho mulatto (the main character of this book is reminiscent of Soaphead Church of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. . . Pathetic. Bad representation of hapas. Get over yourself! Please don't speak for all hapa guys, just your ""fictional, biographical"" self. Can we move into the 21st century with more realistic representations of hapas already!?"
4,Excellent,"A very artistic memoir of a rather disconnected family and a gay brother dieing of AIDS. Chase, who himself is also gay, weaves the bond that ties the two brothers throughout his book. Mainly childhood conspiracies and special games they created together. In the end, however, as his brother's health failed, he had to face and come to terms with the separatism that one must feel when they cannot truly share something as profoundly significant as death. Like most, he was left to sort out the emotions of the living"
3,Easy Read,"This was an easy read, but I was somewhat bored with the plot. I needed a little more action and twists. The serious car accident was played off in a page and 1/2. Not normal Coulter standards."
2,not worth one's time,"The book, though contemporary, is a throwback to both the romance novels of the 1980s and historical romances. The girl is virginal and shy, and the rich, wealthy, powerful male comes to care for her, falls in love, and brings the girl out of his shell.The book's somewhat realistic, in that the guy sometimes lashes out, and says incredibly stupid or cruel things. Some readers find this provides a less escapist experience though.Some parts are adorable. The heroine, despite her British heritage, becomes a huge American football expert. More parts are simply dull, or perhaps eyeroll-inducing. The execution is not good enough to rise above the cliches. Examples include the heroine's Cinderella transformation, a case of mistaken identity, and a vamp's attempted seduction of the hero.The book's not that bad, but it's still not worth one's time."
2,Not Worth Your Time,This book was not up to par for Ms. Coulter. It was very dry and slow. There was not much of a plot and was missing much. I would not recommend nor read again.
2,Not very good,"I've read several other Coulter books, and usually she's a great author, but this one was pretty bad. I couldn't even finish it! My recommendation is that if you still want to try this book, at least get it from the library! I was definitely glad I did, so I didn't waste my money! Happy reading!"
1,Disappointing,"I was deeply disappointed when Ms. Coulter used the phrase spoken by Brant on page 107 of the paperback version: ""He wanted to tell her that Daphne wasn't retarded but she was sliding her hands up his arms to lightly clasp his shoulders."" As a parent of a child with a disability I find this passage to be very offending. It is perpetuating the word ""retarded"" to be used as an offensive phrase. It is as bad as using the ""N"" word and I am hoping that Ms. Coulter refrains from perpetuating the common use of ""retard"" and ""retarded"" as acceptable forms of derogation."
5,Great Video from the viewpoint of the common soldier,"This video is home movies that 5-6 individual German Soldiers took on the Eastern Front from 1941 - 45. The movie is in German, with English subtitles. I found it to be extremely interesting. Well worth the money."
5,The title says it all.,"This is not the world war of the history books. This is the life of a soldier. A German Soldier. (Actually several individual soldiers.) All politics aside, what it gets right down to is that soldiers do not fight for a cause. They fight to survive and to make sure their comrades survive. This is World War II through the eyes of a Wehrmacht soldier. The Wehrmacht were regular German Army. They were not necessarily Nazis. It is important to understand that the SS and The SA (Storm troopers) were Hitler's private army or the army of the Nazi party. The Wehrmacht on the other hand, were regular German army. Watching their handheld films and listening to their narratives will tear down the concepts of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, or us vs. them, and will leave open and naked, the human condition."
5,LOVE Mob Wives!,LOVE Mob Wives!Look forward to the new season of drama. vh1 did it right not so sure about chicago but NYC is awesome!
2,dissapointing,i really wanted to like this book. heard so much good about the book. but the ending was so disappointing. it is very pro integration and left little's in my system anxious and worried.we changed the ending to something that fit better for us and that helped some.
4,"One big, wet, instrumental masterpiece.","Three nerdy white boys riff their way through this excellent release, bouncing from soulful rock to pounding metal to atmospheric jazz and--for a complete curveball--dub reggae. B.I.G. predate Don Caballero by a few years, but their math-metal pedigree remains the standard by which acts like Creta Bouriza, At The Drive-In and By The End Of Tonight thrive upon."
5,Excellent calculator,"Works very well to calculate loan numbers, highly recommend especially if you are in the finance world. Small enough to carry anywhere."
2,Not Thrilled,I guess I'm not really a big fan...- No solar power.- No square root option.- Dust builds up under the display.
4,The Dillards - Back Porch Bluegrass/ Live ...Almost!,"Back Porch Bluegrass/ Live!!! Almost!!!An excellent re-packaging of the first two Dillards albums onto one 75 minute CD. The first a great collection of traditional bluegrass played superbly by the core Dillards quartet, and the second a live concert. Later on in their career they added a drummer and a fiddler, but these albums are just guitar, string bass, 5 string banjo and mandolin ( plus Rodney's harmonica on Taters In Sandy Land/Gimme Chaw T'Baccer).Both are first class albums, but the live one has the added benefit of the Dillards' penchant for self-parody and satire."
5,"The Dillards from ""The Andy Griffith Show""","This is a wonderful Bluegrass group. Their sound was well received inEurope. We really enjoyed them on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" & were pleasedto find their records available on Amazon.Some critics suspected that their music was electronically enhanced, but after investigation foundthat it was just ""The Dillards"" own rapid fire playing style. This musicis highly recommended for any bluegrass music fans."
4,finger pickin good,"A lot of fun , especially when the guys go bonkers mad on tunes 'hickory hollow' and 'duellin banjo'. Funny too on the live album:'we're from missouri..we're hillibillies'"
3,poor sound quality,"I love the Dillards, Mitch Jayne, especially. I bought this album for a friend who is an Andy Griffith fan. I am so glad I opened and listened to it before giving it to her. The audio quality was horrible! Static almost completely over powered the songs. I tried returning it and re-ordering. Same problem. Tried another seller, and still, very bad sound quality. Customer service was excellent, however, with both sellers. I finally downloaded Back Porch Bluegrass from Amazon and got the sound quality expected. But, I still don't have Live!! Almost!!I am hoping it was just a bad batch of CD's."
1,Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya,"The rating is for the defective product. The seller refunded my money promptly, and asssured me that he could exchange if he new the DVD was ok."
5,Best Book on the Subject,"Woodworth brings to light important aspects of source material from common Civil War soldiers that most historians disregard or dismiss with a quick sentence or two. The extensive quotation of what soldiers said about their faith in letters and journals gives an authentic picture of what real individual soldiers of the time thought and believed. Woodworth may have had his own biases in selecting the material presented, but I greatly appreciate what he has done in letting the soldiers speak for themselves. I have a special interest in Christianity during the Civil War, and this is the best book on the subject in the past half century or more."
1,Warranty is nearly worthless!!!,I bought three of these from another store that was going out of business. Two of the three ended up being defective(one would not hold any charge and the other had less than 1hr run time when fully charged). The Energizer warranty stated free replacement for one year. So I followed the warranty instructions and mailed the batteries in for replacement. One month later I received a letter from Audiovox(the actual manufacturer) stating the item was discontinued and no replacement was available. They offered me a refund but that amount would not be enough to replace the battery not to mention the $8 it costs to send the battery in. I believe Audiovox is lying in stating that a replacement was not available as the Energizer website still shows the item as active. I would recommend you avoid this product due to high failure rate along with the warranty not being fully honored by the Audiovox.
1,Serious Reservations about buying Serious Concerns,"Serious Concerns is an 87 page collection of self-indulgent, cynical jabs at the publishers and commissioners, as well at the reader and at other poets. It is one big in-joke that belongs in a very small circle in a depressed part of Britain."
3,interestng,I didn't really know what I was getting myself into with this cd but it is interesting and may prove useful in mixing
4,must express love,"el toro is not only a great band, but a great group of guys. marcus went to my high school and got el toro to come back to play at our after-prom one year. while in high school he played with a group called the mercury decision, who were a big deal in our area. its just great to see a small band of committed musicians finally get some recognition."
5,Christophany: The Fullness of Man (Faith Meets Faith Series),"This book is fantastic for looking into a positive future when we ""shake off our ancient prejudices and build the earth"" as de Chardin said so many years ago. It is a must read for Christians who want backgroud for interreligious dialogue."
2,No noticeable difference,This is far from a wonder drug. I continued to have gall bladder problems well after I had begun swallowing these huge nasty pills.
5,K&N 69-7070TB Typhoon Air Intake,this is a cool intake you can hear it and it sounds great i put it on my 350z the only thing is after i had a shop put it on it moved one of my belts over just so and rubed a hole in my a/c hose so check that after you have it put on but after i had that taken care of its great!!
2,What Guarantee,There was very negligable power gain. And If I could afford to test before and after an install I could ceretainly afford a better system! Fuel ecconnomy did improve approx 7%.
3,Rainbow fans avoid!!,"Fans of Jackson Browne might enjoy this disc; but if you're buying this because of JLT's Purple connections you are gonna be wasting your money. If you enjoy Joe's voice, and want something silly and enjoyable, I'd recommend something more like ""Rescue You"" from 1986; in which JLT does the cheesy Lou Gramm thing; and very well too! But Fandango is just a whole other genre. I haven't heard the rest of their output; and I gave this three stars because I'm not qualified to rate this sort of ballad driven americana either up or down...but it has nothing in common with his later career whatsoever...don't say you haven't been warned."
2,Form Over Function...I Don't Recommend this Pet Carrier,"I bought this pet carrier for my new Boston Terrier puppy - probably 5-6 pounds right now. The ""Small"" size Argo carrier is still much too big for him. However, even if it were the right size, the quality doesn't match the price of this carrier. It looks great, but 1) The holes you load the dog through on the sides are VERY small, even for my little dog - I could barely get him into the thing; 2) The inside is lightly padded on the bottom, but is covered only with hard plastic - other carriers have nice furry insides; 3) It doesn't have any pockets to hold your personal items (wallet, cell phone), or the dog's items (clean-up bags, treats, etc.). The peep hole is nice, but there's no way to cover it up (in case the dog gets over-excited in public, you want to make a quick run into the grocery without anyone noticing him, etc.) In summary, the bag looks very cute, but is not very functional. I returned it immediately."
5,Quality is fantastic!,This carrier is a great buy and the seller is extremely responsive. The shipping is very fast and you will not be disappointed with the quality. The item is sturdy and appears to be made of quality materials that will last a great deal of time. I have had this product for approximately 6 months and it works wonderfully with my miniature pinscher.She likes sitting in it and the cushion is removable inside. This helps for easy cleaning. The inside materials are not easily soiled so cleaning is not required often.
3,Cute..but Bulky,"I was very excited when I ordered this bag for my 2.5 lbs. Yorkie. When I received it, I put my dog in, she had plenty of room to sleep and the head hole is very roomy for her to peak her head through. The only downfall of this bag (in my opinion) is that it is quite bulky when you are carrying it. I've only used it a few time because quite honestly, it's easier to just carry my dog verses the dog in the bag."
3,"Very nice quality, some design flaws","I bought this carrier in blue. It is nicely made, and as someone addicted to assorted carriers for my pup (over 20) I can tell you that this one is about the quality you can expect for the price. A big plus is that it doesn't collapse the way that many do, so your pet won't have to endure the 'oh no, my world is caving in'. On the bad side, you MUST use the attached leash clip that is inside, otherwise your pet may climb out of the head opening. It would be perfect if there was a zippable mesh around that hole, or if the bag came in a smaller model. Longer straps or a shoulder strap would be nice. Not the best for a dog under 5 pounds, but would probably be fine for 5 to 10 pounds."
4,Extremely Large Opening,"I purchased this for my Min Pin puppy (currently 2.5 lbs). It was difficult to get her into, and she immediately jumped out of the hole, which is quite large. There is a fastener that connects to the puppy's collar, but even after adjusting it to shorten the length (as much as possible), she could still jump out... she just couldn't go anywhere because her collar was still connected to the bag. I returned it immediately, and purchased theTeafco Argo Petascope Airline Approved Carrier, Small, Kiwi Greeninstead. There is no way for her to jump out of it. Additionally, it can be carried, and has an optional shoulder strap, which is padded very nicely.To provide an idea of the size of the opening, my sister has a Miniature Schnauzer (3 human years old), which would be fine in the carrier, although I cannot imagine it being easy to put her into the carrier. I am going to go ahead and give it 4-stars because it is a great product for some animals, just not for my puppy."
5,"can love last, the fate of romance over time","Excellent book. Brings to light the psychology that lies in a relationship. You will understand what may have went wrong in past relationships and learn to love with a greater knowledge of self andother, making future relationships easier."
3,An AP student's Perspective,"First off, I use this book for AP European history. I find that it is generally good, yet at times there will be very vague sentences, such as this one: ""They sought French aid, and the French barely failed to land a sizable arguments."" There have only been 3 typos in the first 8 chapters. Though a few funny sentences such as ""The French, naturally uninterested...""In all its a decent in depth book about European history, and to all other students, I would like to share a link:[...]"
4,"Good Puzzles , Good graphics with an English heroine","This game has really nice graphics. The Louvre is an interesting setting for your adventures, which are in many different centuries. This is a point and click game with difficult to solve puzzles. The English heroine wears warrior like attire and is trying to save the Earth from evil villians, who are always a step ahead. There is very little violence in this game and it's not bloody at all. It's a fun game. The plot could be a little more developed as well as the star character."
2,"Terrible, terrible low resolution graphics",This game will install on windows XP and it will run if you run it in Windows 95 compatability mode... but when you finally get it running it looks terrible. This game is in 640 x 480 resolution only and you can't change that. It looks very faded with lots of pixilation. It doesn't look anything like the box shots at all.
5,DO NOT CONSIDER THIS GAME VIOLENT,this is a second review from me-after reading all the reviews-i had to add this-i do not know why this game is rated teen or considered violent-i despise horror games and even feel that seven games of the soul-minus the violence- is morbid and inappropriate for children -the underlying theme itself is morbid-this is not a bloody game at all -or- in my opinion-inappropriate for anyone-i have seen kids movies and cartoons with more violence-i would reccomend it to any age-i think that some parts of these reviews -and the teen rating-are very misleading
1,Horrible!! If you buy buy it ...!!,"I was so excited when the game arrived so I popped it in as soon as I could and it started out okie, the intro movie was a little choppy and boring but the musem break throu was cool. I think that was the best five minutes of the game the rest was horrible! The main character was annoying I mean come on who has to change clothes to throw a rock? there were so many cut scenes that were not needed. I swear the girl had to change her clothes to do the smallest things. The puzzles were [disappointing], the characters didn't even open there mouths to speak and looked almost like zombies and the ending didn't even make sense because you can barely understand what the hell they are saying. This is the worse game I have every played I'm so glad I only paid four dollars for it."
1,Not a pure adventure game.,"One star for the little bit of adventure. I started the game but couldn't stick with it, gave up playing it even when I was craving for any adventure game. Too technically gadgety. Boring."
5,EXCELLENT,"If you are looking to get with God and clear up your life this book is for you. It leads you into a intimate relationship with God. It takes forty days to go through the book, it took me 60 so don't get discouraged if it takes you longer then it is supposed to."
2,shocking,"Shocking -- because I read The George Eliot book first, and based on that (even though it's essentially chewing gum for the eyes of TVphobes) I sought out Skom's other two books, and this one is unbelievably amateurish -- not at all as smooth as book number two. Even so, neither of Skom's first two books present her protagonist as much more than a robot. As I said in a comment to a reviewer of the George Eliot book, there is a tremendous temptation to psychoanalyze: has she become an academic because she is unsuited to anything more social? Asberger's syndrome? Definitely obsessive. And not particularly logical in her pursuit of dangerous perpetrators: would you venture into isolated quarters when you know there's a killer around, a killer who is probably after you? (""Who calls me coward?"")A question: does Northwestern University library use the Dewey Decimal System?! Most academic libraries use the LC classification..."
2,Disappointing,"This really gets 2.5 stars for me (rounded down to 2), because I was able to finish it, and found it interesting enough, but it really lacked something. I could not get into the characters, and the literary references all over the book were mostly over my head. The mystery was okay, convoluted enough to have an interesting resolution, but the investigation felt amateurish considering one of the protagonists was supposed to be an FBI agent. What's an FBI agent doing investigating the theft of books from a university anyway, even if they are valuable? If he'd been called in after the murders, maybe, but it comes across as really contrived to me. Murder by karate chop to the neck also came across as corny even if it is plausible. And the attempt at romance felt gratuitous and limp. I picked this up because it was supposedly nominated for several awards for best first novel but it was disappointing."
5,Love it!,It is great fun reading about a life lived to the fullest with the most interesting travels and meetings. The subtle sense of humor throughout the book is also reflected in the authors art work.
5,Expanding Fun,"Of course this is an expansion on the original Typhoon Rising. Yet, it adds more levels and more vehicles. I love the dirtbike, and when you hop in the abrams tank oh man, you better watch out. This game is so much fun to play whether on a team vs. another team or on a team vs. the computer. I can't recall how many nights I spent playing this game hours on end. Make sure you have the required setup recommended even better, because it will definitely strain your system. At least it did mine."
2,WAS lots of fun,When this game came out in 03? it was a blast! now the graphics are dated and the fact that Nova Logic doesnt stay on top of punk buster like they should turns this once great game into a non-playable. I give it 5 stars for what it once was.
3,Not too much of an add-on,"Yeah, this game rocks, but it didn't add too much to the original. Sure, you feel good because you completed the JO set, but I've found myself liking the servers with the original JO better. The only thing I found better about this game was the tanks a little and the dirt bikes. I found a server with all hills like a construction zone. I took the dirt bike and OH MAN! I had so much fun getting hangtime by jumping off the hills and getting air! Very fun! But other than that, I don't think this game is worth $30 just to add that little amount of stuff."
2,Where did this book come from?,"When I read this book, I was fascinated by the story of Cook's life (who wouldn't be?) but I was sure this book was a reprint of some turn of the 19th/20th century author. But no, it was published in 1995. So where does this guy get that Australian aborigines are negrotoid and Inuits are mongoloid? Has he read any recent anthropology? Does he still believe in phrenology? He seems not to have read anything besides Beaglehole's biography and Beaglehole's editions of the journals, except for a few other journals by the crew. There is no historiography and no analysis. This book was originally a manuscript Hough found in a Victorian attic, I am sure of it!"
4,Let us celebrate discoveries that did not happen,"The author did a most diligent job in charting the life of Captain Cook. He writes well and the prsentation can not be faulted. But, clearly, he is a great admirer of his subject and seemingly partial to him at times. Cook was more of a surveyor than a discoverer, and some of the heroics might be displaced. His third voyage shows that he was not stable enough mentally. Even his seafaring pales in comparison to his famous predecessors who achieved more with less. Think of the incredible yourney of one of his officers, William Bligh, in an open boat, without supplies, across 3'600 miles of ocean. And why was Cook always returning to Tahiti, even though it was out of his way? It seems to me that there are many questions yet to be answered, in an unbiased way."
4,Much more interesting than I had expected,"When I purchased this biography I expected it to be dull and tedious...much like a high school history textbook, and I was pleasantly surprised by the book. The narrative is exciting and engaging and the settings and scenes are vividly descriptive. I found myself genuinely caring not only for Cook, but for his crew members as well. It's an extraordinary story told with remarkable skill and deference. I highly recommend it."
3,Getting into his mind,"Commonly the outstanding figures in history are understood by their attributed deeds and not by much else. But, of course, they were as human as you and I, and therefore variously quirky. This book not only follows the famous Capt. Cook's curriculum vitae, but also paints a picture of his somewhat inscrutable and sometimes dark personality, revealed in his relations with his crews and others in his life -- a bit much of this morbidity for my tastes, but perhaps necessary to a full conception of the man. I'm a landlubber, but it's not hard to imagine what bobbing up and down at sea for months and years with no one but English sailors for company might do to the mind."
4,This is a readable biography of Capt. Cook.,"Hough does a fairly complete job of biographing Capt. Cook. The book provides not only his story, but an insight into the lifestyle of a British Naval captain. Although not as thorough as Beaglehole, it is easier to digest."
5,A great read! Highly recommended!,I highly recommend this book. It gives a poignant overview of the tragedy and a compelling overview of the man behind it. The author has gone to great lengths to research the disaster and it shows-- in a very readable way. An enjoyable read!
5,Exactly what i was looking for,Excellent book. I recently heard some references to this incident had absolutely no idea thatbit had happened at all. I really wanted to know the whole story. This was riveting and complete. Loved it.
3,Disappointing,"There have been a few books written on this disaster at sea, and this book got good reviews.... But I found it disappointing. It seemed to me like a longggg magazine article. Maybe the problem was that the characters are all so very unlikeable. After the fire and the chaos, for which there was no excuse, there are many good words written about passengers, but the crew was, almost to a one, petty, ignorant of their duties, and just basically unlikeable, so I didn't care about what happened to them. I don't like cruise ships, anyway; I find them claustrophobic and boring, unless perhaps if you drink and gamble, which I don't do. I am aware of improvements over the past many years since this incident, but still we read about almost-disasters happening in our seas week after week. After reading this book, it just confirms my refusal to ever go on another cruise."
1,Do Not Purchase! Kindle Version Incorrectly Formatted!,"I was thrilled to see Fowlie's Rimbaud translations available for the Kindle. Unfortunately, something went completely awry in the conversion process, and the French and English are randomly mixed together. It's completely unreadable. Different poems are even mixed together in some cases. Hopefully the publisher can fix this, as this version is not only a huge disappointment, but a complete waste of money."
5,Poetry's Young Genius,"In two words - beyond spectacular. Sheer Genius this is not poetry it is magic. Dark Poetry, but sheer poetical genius. Rimbaud is well beyond the league of Verlaine his famous contemporary and friend. How can you leave this book without being touched by the sheer emotion. Here is the poet's cry from the very depth of the human abyss. I can reread Rimbaud endlessly and yet feel spellbound each time."
4,comprehensive -- perfect for acolytes & people becoming operas,"Possibly, the best translation of Rimbaud's work yet.After you weep with the orphans, this bookwill take you all the way to Ethiopia,& you will wonder if he left his family there."
2,Drys great but the lint catcher is terrible,We've owned this dryer for over a year and a half and it has destroyed the spaghetti straps from numerous tank tops and my childrens overalls. The drying itself is great but anything with a strap will get caught on the lint catcher-it's a terrible design...I wish we would have returned it right after we bought it.
2,Is it Full of Moths,This was a highly rated dryer so I bought it. I have been using dryers for years and they normally last 15 years or more. So I moved and I needed to buy a washer and dryer and bought this. It dried fine. But then I started to notice little pin prick holes in my clothes. I am saying to myself maybe these were here and I just never noticed . My mother was very sick and I was her sole caretaker she had died and I just moved. So I might have missed them because I was stressed. But no I brought new clothes and there were holes in them too. Next thing was to figure out if it was the dryer or the washer. It was the dryer. I called repair and he mentioned that he is getting calls like this all of the time. I called Frigidaire and told them people are complaining all over the internet about the same problem and the repairman told me he has been calls to. Mind you he said not just Frigidaire dryers but other brands too. Frigidaire and me came to a amicable agreement. But buyer beware'
5,Reads like a novel!,"I just finished up this book and felt I just had to write a review. I thought it was interesting, and entertaining start to finish. It reads like a novel, and I even dfound myself laughing at the antics involved.The ingenuity, planning, fearlessness, and in some cases blatant disregard for one's safety was amazing. It was mind-boggling difficulties involved in not only escaping the castle Colditz, but escaping Nazi-occupied Europe in general. It put alot of things into context, as one cannot simply ""boy-scout"" it throught the hills and woods to the Swiss border. Indeed, an escaper's journey was only starting once he left the walls of Colditz.I second at least one previous reviewer that this book is not just for hardcore history readers. Theres something in it for everybody."
4,Good,"A great book that deals with the origins of sexual disorders in a curious way, by reviewing the work of the renowned scientist Magnus Hirschfeld. The book was written in a friendly manner which touches all men with problems in an intimate way, and is close to the suffering man, but it's not as detailed as ""The Advanced Man! The quick and easy way to turn your small, or average sized penis into a large super human love tool without wasting your money on B.S. ... Book on CD-Rom for PC & Mac Computers"" by Platinum Millennium, a book that i think you might find more suited for you"
5,Excellent Watch,"I bought this watch months ago, all was excellent, the time of delivery, the watch, all. I love it."
2,breaks very easily,"I had one of these scoopes for 8 years and it was fine, I got a new pup so I thought I would buy a new scoop, supposedly the same king. NO NO NO, this scoop breaks in the same place everytime, the plastic is weak. I have purchased three of them in one year! Poor product."
2,Almost a Winner,"The Allen Scooper works great until it breaks, which is frequently. It's made very cheaply with flimsy plastic parts that just won't hold up, even without abusing the device. It's too bad, because right up until some part snaps in two, the scooper makes scooping droppings almost fun. It's quite easy to use. They just need to make either some design improvements or notch up the quality of the parts."
2,Works well while it lasts,"The product picks up the poop and empties very well (have a large dog) but the plastic pull up handle always breaks between 3-6 months. If the product would last longer it would be a great value for the $$$$. Seems to me for very little money the product could vastly improve it's longevity. This seems to be a wide spread problem, at some point nobody will be left willing to pay $12-$15 for a product with such a short useful life. Good function, lousy longevity."
1,Do not buy this product,"Do not buy this, I have bought two of them and they both broke within a year and the company will not stand behind them. The little plastic ""arms"" that open the scoop are too weak."
4,Great Scooper!,"We like these scoopers for the yard, even for smaller dog stuff, because it has a long handle and is designed to let the grass stay put. These are made of plastic with some metal parts and they do not last forever, especially since we keep it outside where it's needed every day. So we always keep two spares: one for when the current scooper dies (usually after a year or two) and one to give away to the visiting friends who say they MUST get one! How else can you make a friend so happy for 15 bucks?!"
3,2BigDogs,"Packed well... but took forever to receive... customer service was helpful... the second time around.I have two big dogs and thought this would make cleaning my backyard a breeze... WRONG!It has a very weak spring, and leaves half the poop in the grass.Save your money and just use your grocery store bags."
3,Maybe it needs to get some design changes...,"This article seems to be a strong piece of plastic but after 6 to 8 months using it there were too many break-points every where...Probably it will better if used on carrying lil' dog ""cakes""... I have two Collies and it wasn't hard enough to ""finish that hard work""...Cheers,Eddie."
2,Breaks your heart when it breaks...,"Went to an over-crowded pound and was adopted by a cute little lab. So of course I had to buy one of these. It is wonderful, you get used to just squeezing the handle and it opens up, surround the 'present' and let go of the handle, the 'present' is surrounded for correct disposal.Then one side, plastic I find out, breaks. No longer will the jaws open. Not much point to this thing unless the jaws open. Meanwhile, the puppy is now a dog. The 'presents' are a lot bigger. And, I was spoiled by the ease of cleanup when this thing worked.I'm sure somebody makes this in a more sturdy model. Wiser now, I will look out for anything plastic and avoid it. Good idea. Just not really well done.I'm still looking."
2,Frustrating,"Wonderful until it breaks. I've had 3 break in 2 years - On 1 - handle broke, On 2 of them the part that open & closes broke, on 2 of them springs broke."
3,Loose joints,"It is fine, but not really sturdy. The hook at the jaw gets loose and undone. Just a bit wobbly."
5,One handed Pooper Scooper,This product is great. It allows me to pick up the patties using one hand for the scooper. It's large and strong enough to handle the leavings of my mastiff. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an easy way to pick up after their dog while remaining at a distance from the stinky stuff.
3,QChord cartridges,It's okay but not as nice as I expected. I thought the arrangements were pretty simple. I would have preferred more complicated ones.
3,Easy to read but LOUD,I got this watch yesterday while my Wenger is being repaired. The face is easy to read even at night due to the Indiglo feature and the luminous hands. My only complaint is that the movement is very LOUD. The tick tick tick can be heard in a large room and is grating on the neves after a while. sounds more like a Baby Ben alarm cloch than a watch.
3,Watch looks significantly different from the image shown,"The watch shown in the picture is a women's watch with a white dial. But the watch that I received was a men's watch with a larger brown dial. I'm really disappointed as it was actually a gift shipped to my sister.I've made up my mind that I will not buy from this seller again. Very poor product description!!!!Apart from that, the watch itself is nice. So I started using it."
1,Poor quality,Very poor quality--seams unraeled just by unzipping.Cannot possibly hold the weight of a bunch of books.Material is light weight and too filmsy. Company customer service is awful--especially if purchased through amazon.I do not recomend this item at all
2,Maximum Rancid,"Ok, first off, everyone THERE IS NO RANCID MUSIC ON THIS CD. What it pretty much is, is a cd of a brittish sounding woman reading a magazine article on the band. The ""interviews"" with the band are a joke. I think there might be 2 sentance clips from each member. It pretty much tells the story of how the band got together, their influences, and success. It gives about a sentance explanation for many songs. The best thing I got from it was the other bands that were mentioned as influences or side projects that I had never heard of before. Unless you can find this dirt cheap, I'm sure you can read everything that is said in multiple magazine articles or websites. If I would have heard it before I bought it, I would not have bought it."
2,Not for Dummies Who Don't Understand Web Design (HTML),"A lot of good information if you are familiar with HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) Don't most of us today use an Editor when creating our web pages? How many of us are still comfortable using HTML? This book is my second dissapointment this week with the ""Dummy Books"". Maybe the publishers are no longer winking at us when they refer to us as dummies. Methinks they mean it literally now after after being ""taken"" twice this week.In the promo for this book there is no mention there is going to be a heavy reference to and a working knowledge need for HTML. So unless you are buying this book for your guru web editor it will be of limited value.There are a lot of good ideas in this book, however, the publisher should have been a little more forthcoming about prerequisites necessary to understanding what this book is all about."
4,Good for beginners,"A bit repeatative at times and a bit dumb not but once, but hey, afterall it's a book for Dummies :-)I am still reading the book, and I can say that for someone with very little working and theoretical knowledge of SEO, this is probably the best start you could have.The world of SEO is huge and you wouldn't want a book to clutter you with emmense amounts of detailed technicalities because it would probably be overwhelming, so what's the point?Read this at ease - there is still an enormous amount of info in this book to get you started and broaden your horizons as far as SEO is concerned.Good luck! :-)"
5,An awesome Book on Search Engine Optimization!,"I recently finished reading this book and found it very helpful. Peter Kent clarifies what search engines like and don't like and what you need to do to get high rankings. I'm just beginning to implement some of the suggestions and ideas from this book. I'm a non geek so if I can do it, anyone could. This is a must have book for every website owner/builder, whether they are webmasters or newbies. I just wish I had read this book before my e-commerce store was dynamically built. I could have avoided a lot of headaches for myself later on. I'm stopping my pay per click keywords (they're too costly and havn't brought me that many sales anyway) and going to get listed naturally with the help of this book!"
5,love it,"This book is my kind of read. Straight to the point, he tells you exactly what to do. By applying this book to my website I will save thousands of dollars in advertising. Now thats a great investment!"
5,Search Engine Optimization helped a Dummy,"I have been blogging for some time. But my blog was only creeping up in popularity. It was an invisible spot in cyberspace. After reading only the first three chapters, I learned how to submit my blog to the Interet so that it would be highly visible. And I learned about keyword rankings, and how to make the best use of these in my title and my writing.Thanks[...]"
4,Learning the basics easily,"As the name suggests this really is a book for dummies. But you don't have to feel bad about not knowing anything on this subject. In an ever rapidly changing world of Search Engine Optimisation, this book will get you up to speed very quickly. Although the various search engine algorithms have probably changed since this book was printed, if you follow the easy to understand steps you will be absolutely doing the right thing.The most important piece of advice in this book is, after you have implemented all the tips, be patient! It takes time to make an impact on the organic SEO circuit! - Again, a great book, but you must have patience."
4,Read this before building your website,"I attended a few training seminars on SEO and social media marketing. The seminars had been very helpful in fixing many things in my blogs and websites. But many questions remain in my head after observing what some sites have been doing. This book covers practically all of these issues. UIt does not provide you only with the ""howtos"" but also answers the ""whys"". Understanding the ""whys"" makes the SEO process not at all a mindless task of using keywords and backlinking. I don't fully agree with all the recommendations though. The book somehow leaves the impression that websites are put up primarily for SEO purposes. Websites serve many purposes. Design is also very important. The book does help one find the balance between SEO and website design and writing."
2,If Your A Newbie Than This Is For You !,"Hi,I purchased this product and found the information somewhat outdated and iffy. It covered the basics, so for a newbie it would be a good book to get you started. I needed something a more advanced and this is just basic information. All in all it is a decent product for beginners.Todd"
4,Great for Newbies,"If you're up-to-date with all the latest and greatest this is mainly a review. However, if you're not completely familiar with the terms and usage of SEO this is a great book.Very informative, easy to read, nice to reference.I would recommend this book to anyone working with a designer who is unfamiliar with SEO (most) or anyone who wants to brush up on the basics.Although this book nor any others will be the tell-all guide this is a good start. SEO changes so rapidly more research is always required. This book gives a great start to the research."
5,Very Informative an Easy read,Peter has created a wonderful way for you to become listed in the top 10% or higher ( Depending if you are willing to follow his suggestions totally) I have been able I have been able to raise my own website to the top 1% by just following Peters Suggestions.
4,Good SEO starter book,"This is a good book for those new to SEO (Search Engine Optimization). The author gives good tips on how to get indexed in Google and other major search indexes and engines. Most importantly, this book details what not to do, so as not to damage the Google PageRank of your Website."
4,SEO for Dummies Review,Great read! More informative than most but lacked in-depth detail about directories and human edited directories for traffic purposes. It also had little on buying links for traffic purposes or similar. There were lots of links to consider and most were of quality. I recommend it if you haven't had a lot to do with SEO to date.
4,Very knowledgable Author,"Impressed with the authors knowledge on this ""black art"" topic.This book is very well written and gives excellent advice to beginners and intermediate webmasters looking to advance their website rankings.It has given me great guidance on how to increase hits for my website.Andy - Webmaster(...)"
4,Every website owner must buy this book!,"I bought this book to learn what I couldnt afford my web guy to do for me. My website was not generating much traffic and I thought it was a lack of good key words.Here's what I learned in the first 3 chapters: By looking at the source code on my site as instructed by the book to do for basic elements I found:My web pages beyond the home page had no title, description or key words! And more disturbing, my web guys business info was listed in the top area of every page where my page description and key words are supposed to go! I also learned I was not listed in an important directory, which I was able to do myself in 10 minutes.I am hopping mad at my web guy and looking for a new one! BUY THE BOOK!"
1,Used with low results,"The author of the book knows his stuff, when it comes to SEO, however he doesn't know how to explain it well. For as long as this book is, there is really only about six chapters that contain practical information for those working to SEO their site.I don't recomend this book simply I because there is too much useless information on a subject that needs direct answers."
3,avarage,"there are some mistakes in the bookfor exampleon page 108 the writer claim that it is possible to separate keywordsin a name with dashes.but by google [...]read the Terms you want to exclude (-)also in the book it is mention that yahoo get its search result for bing,it is not true."
3,It is not good and it is not bad.,"I will say I did learn a few things reading this, but it is not the book to spend money on buying it new. I would get it at a used book store, you will need more than this to get on your way, it is like the beginners place to start and then be preparied to read a few other books, watch some youtube videos and then you will have some knowledge to work with where SEO is concerned. Thanks to google it is a lot more work than it once was and they are changing every month so you have to stay on top of it."
4,"Not new to SEO, picked up a few tips","I found this book valuable, even though I'm not a complete newbie to SEO. I flagged a dozen or so useful tips that I plan to use on my site. Perhaps the strongest and relevant portion of the book was the local search info - I'd recommend supplementing that with information from Google Adwords for Dummies and the Perry Marshall Adwords book, all of which I've read recently. With those in hand, you have a good shot at improving your ranking for local search."
4,Great for Starters,"I liked this book because users with different levels of computer proficiency are able to follow all the information. A good ""for dummies"" book"
4,It's whorthwhile,This book is better than I expected. It's really a good SEO guide for beginners like me.
1,Formatting renders this unreadable on Kindle,The layout of this book has not been reworked to suit the epub format. It is completely unreadable and unusable. Don't bother with the kindle edition.
5,First search book that helped me (of two),"I maintain a lot of volunteer websites (social sciences) and recently had to move many of them from one server to another -- ie., from one domain to another domain. Getting good advice has been hard -- some of the SEO message boards,etc., never really want to answer questions -- perhaps not wanting to 'give' away secrets, etc. I ordered Peter Kent's book, thinking I might not keep it if it didn't help. The information that I found was really correct (based on my personal experience with about 1000 sites), useful, and covered some areas (importance of title tags, for example), that other books hadn't given much coverage. I was helped, and do recommend this book. Follow his advice and you should have a site that is at least liked immediately by search engines, if not loved... (given content, content, content, of course)"
5,AMAZING,"You must read this book. It will open your eyes to what friendship is... and should be about! We have many ""mis-conceptions"" on friendship...I recommend to everyone, it is truly amazing!"
5,Spanish/English tanslaor,Great product for those looking for a Spanish/English translation aide. Use is very easy to master and dictionary is extensive. Just the aide for a serious user or student.
1,"Forget this DVD, get the Orion VHS!","There really isn't much to say about the film. If you don't know it already and like it you probably won't buy it anyway, because it's just an obscure Korean monster flick. But if you want it, here's my advice: Try to get one of the old Orion tapes and just forget about this DVD. Though my DVD-player says it's encoded at sufficently high bit rates, the image sometimes looks as blocky and noisy as a VCD. I thought I could upgrade from VHS to DVD, but surely not with Alpha's horrible release."
4,A Good Piece Multicultural Literature,"A young Korean girl, Nico, feels different from all her friends. All of Nico's friends and families look like one another but Nico and her sister, Angel, all do not look like her friends or even their own parents. Nico and Angel were adopted. Her mother explains to Nico that all families, no matter different, are all tied together with a special kind of glue, called love. After this Nico explores the city which she lives in and discovers there are many types of families. There are stepsiblings, grandparents, single parents, and much more. Nico realizes she is just like everyone else.Families are Different is a seeming good multicultural book because it highlights groups of people outside the sociopolitical mainstream. The selection exhibits a positive perspective towards multi-ethnic families. It encourages diversity and could help a child feel more confidence about his or her self as Pellearini explains that families are composed of love."
5,Wonderful story about not-so-different families,"I really enjoyed the way this book explored not only issues of adoption, but the way in which so many families now are not ""traditional"". I am glad that this book is around for my daughter to read. The families are presented in an honest, straightforward way -- and really don't seem that ""different"" after all!"
4,Eclectic oldies compilation,The track listing is as follows:1. Wicked Game by Chris Isaak2. All Around the World by Lisa Stansfield3. First We Take Manhattan by Jennifer Warnes4. Moonlight on Water by Laura Branigan5. Crazy by Seal6. I'll Always Love You by Taylor Dayne7. Drive by the Cars8. This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) by Natalie Cole9. Up Where We Belong by Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes10. Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight by James Taylor
3,Good thinking but too basic,"I can believe Mr. Apostolico would make a tough tourney opponent.Unfortunately this isn't The Idiot's Guide, it's ThePocket Idiot's Guide. It's not everything, it's everything that fits in your back pocket.The whole thing runs about 200 pages and there's an awful lot of the basics covered here: examples of HE poker hands, a glossary, where to find poker tournaments, and on and on.I'm looking forward to his book later in the year on the Pro Poker Tour. That may well be a worthwhile read.For now, read one of Dan Harrington's tournament poker books instead. He knows his stuff. (If you know the ranking of poker hands and have played a few times, you can follow it.)For HE in general, read Getting Started in Hold 'em by Ed Miller for basics and the mindset needed for Texas Hold'em."
5,The coolest Pokemon,"I bought beanie Squirtle because he's my favorite Pokemon.He's one of the three starter Pokemon.He comes with a tag that tells his hieght,weight,and Pokedex description.beanie and/or Pokemon fans should get one."
4,really fun!,"finnaly a soft cute pokémon stuffed animal,desinged as the pokémon under water element... squrtlie!with blue soft cloth this stuffed animal is a great toy."
5,New Graduates Must Read This Book,"This book expresses real thoughts and emotions everyone goes through when they graduate and must step out into the ""real"" world."
4,a notre sante,"The rest of this album did not quite match my expectations after hearing the genial recording of a notre sante. However, I suspect it will grow on me. A notre sante is a wonderful song for use in French 2-3 classes!!"
3,Doesn't mix as well as some others...,"Although tasting pretty good, this stuff doesn't like mixing up very well with milk. Also, mine didn't come with a scoop (unless it's floating somewhere at the bottom and I'm just too lazy to dig through.)I may buy it again, but I can't say for certain. I got it cheap"
1,ARTIFICIAL CRAP.!,1st of all look at the ingredients... you see artificial flavors then SUCRALOSE which is an atrificial sweetener... ARTIFICIAL EQUALS CRAP... Try hemp protein if you want 100% Organic Foods... NOT Modified or Engineered... HEMP is the best protein!!!!
2,A disappointment-,I still refer to my original settlement cookbook. I don't like the way the new book is organized. I don't feel as if it is a quick reference guide which I was hoping because that is how I use my first version. Menus aren't simple and don't help me as a working mom.
5,Excellent old fashioned cook book,This is a replacement copy that was worn by the years of use. Good advice that is not available elswhere.
1,"Nice toy, but fragile","Our boys liked the toy. Unfortunately, the underside of the control handle started fracturing a few days into playtime, and the rod connecting it to the truck cab snapped clean in two after a few more days of play.Next time we'll get Fisher-Price."
2,Full price for a used DVD?!?,"I purchased this DVD from the site (not another seller) last month. When it arrived I realized that there was no way that the DVD was new. It was tapped closed (not with normal security tape) and when I tried to remove the tape it ripped the whole cover off. Then, when I got the package open the plastic prongs that hold the DVD in place were broken and the DVD was scratched. So, I am really happy that I paid full price for an obviously used item. Thanks! The only reason I am giving 2 stars it because I love the movie."
5,Womanhood at it's best!,"Not only did this movie portray the essance if a womans soul but by diversity and strong will, the four main characters experience what few other women ever have the chance too.They all reveal a common bond established in girlhood,It is what gives them strengh,love of self,it will continue bind them together for a lifetime. And as the next generation follows, she too is brought into this sacred sisterhood. Like Steel Magnolias,a dynamic protryal of strong women we all want to be."
4,excellent adaptation,"I totally loved this film. Fans of the novel will NOT be disappointed. Some of the scenes are altered from the book, and some of the plot is omitted entirely, of course, but that's the way it always is with movies based on novels.Ashley Judd again gives an inspired performance in my opinion. James Garner is great also, as is Maggie Smith.Sandra Bullock is OK as Sidda, but you know how that is-- Sandra Bullock is never much more than just OK.Callie Khouri did a great job directing this-- it's like watching life itself unfold before your eyes.A great line from the movie is ""they'll explain it at The Betty""-- just wait until you see it for yourself; you won't be disappointed.ken32"
3,"The Blah, Blah Sisterhood","I love Maggie Smith, but please Maggie stick to English characters........"
3,"Ya, ya - So, So","This movie has been tagged as a ""woman's"" or ""girley"" movie but since this movie is about relationships guys should see it too. I loved the Southern setting but the accents could have been a little more""Southernish"". I wish there would have been more stories from the years passed as they all arrived at that point in time with their continued friendships. I was let down by the ""Secret"" thinking it was something more dramatic than it was. Along with laughter there were a few tears and sniffles shed at the end. A great movie to share with friends, mother, daughter. This movie will rekindle friendships that have been ignored."
2,One of the most depressing movies I have ever seen,This was a big disappointment. Very dark humor about alcoholism and abuse to treat manic depression. Not how the movie was promoted. Where we were the whole audience left feeling uneasy from what they saw. I think this move went a little too far. If you wish to be depressed from a show - Go see this movie.About 30 minutes of the movie is wonderful and gracefully turns into a Hollywood nightmare.
2,Seen it all before!,"This is the kind of film you go to because you want to have a feel good movie watching experience. Unfortunately after about 20 minutes you'll be checking your watch to see how much time is left. The secrets revealed in Ya-Ya are nothing new, in fact they are not even interesting. Sandra Bullock plays a successful working woman who complains just a little to much about her mother who lives hundreds of miles away. Sandra thinks her mother is crazy, but in a funny and goodnatured way, little does she know that the secret the movie is all about is that her mother IS really crazy. Ya-Ya is a lot of talk and no substance, you feel nothing for any of the characters, except for maybe poor James Garner for being trapped in a movie his character is not needed in and appears not even to be wanted in. My advice to is to go rent 'Fried Green Tomatoes' and see a better movie, and save yourself a buck."
4,Pretty good chick flick,"This isn't bad for chick flick. Sandra Bullock and James Gardner were really good in this movie. Maggie Smith was pretty funny as Caro, the friend. It's a touching story to watch. It's also very moving too."
2,We have a winner ...,"Our house has the competition to find the worst movie on earth and boy we have seen some poor movies. This one is not the worst however, as Camilla just cannot be beat for that. But this is pretty awful. Great cast, nice premise, but over indulgent directing. Cut 20 to 30 minutes out, make this film move and you'd have a winner, because it does have smart, funny and poignant moments.Slow, ponderous, turgid are words that come to mind."
2,Not worth the money,"I rented this movie, hoping it would be kinda Steel Magnolia's all over, but I was sorely disappointed. All the older actresses had these horrible southern accents, and Sandra Bullock couldn't remember if she was from Louisiana or the Midwest, and kept bouncing back and forth between the two accents (and yes, I am southern, and have lived in the south my entire life, so I can spot a fake accent). All in all, a waste of my time and money."
3,Yawn-Yawn Sisterhood,"There's really nothing special about this movie, and Callie Khouri should almost feel bashful for going from ""Thelma and Louise"" to this. The only thing that's effective about the movie is its ability to evoke emotions courtesy of typical chick flick devices -- the mother/daughter confliced relationship, girly-girl friendships.I suppose it's much more enjoyable viewing this if you've read the book, because you can tell how it's trying really hard to capture the vibrance the book is so famous for. However, it seemed to me much more like a string of 10-minute skits of little schoolgirl plays."
4,mothers and daughters,"Roger Ebert hated this movie, but I liked it as a story of the young woman Sidda (Sandra Bullock) who comes to grips with her strained relationship with her mother through the help of her mother's three lifelong friends."
1,"ZZZZ Looking for a storyline, here . .","If you like contrived, surrepetitious, and lazy stereotypes . . you'll love Ya-Ya. What an incredible cure for narcoleptics!!!Certainly, there are many other films - much more adept at exploring mother-daughter angst and guilt, and shared feelings of the adult sorority . . ."
4,Ya-Ya and All Things Southern,"Thanks to the viewer from New York. I have read other reviews by this person and recognize the value of his/her voice. I do have some difficulty on his/her opinion when it comes to ""Ya-Ya"". The only advice I have is to re-read Wells, Conroy and Faulkner...and possibly Capote's short stories. And, if reading doesn't strike a chord, travel the south for a year or more.I have some southern relatives who speak as gracefully as the cast of characters in this film. There is mostly good dialogue...with only one or two scenes that make me wince. Anyway, hooray for Ashley Judd and Cheri Brooks. Taj Mahal's band tribute to the 40s in Lousianna is superb. I am not sure how another film could capture ""southern"" today and past in one. Wonderful wardrobe and melding of characters over time. Good blend of humor and drama. Hooray! I'll watch this DVD over and over!"
2,"ya-ya, yeah, yeah...","If you've read the book, do not see the movie. Miss-cast, miss-directed. Take an endearing story of women of strong character, and replace the layers so carefully revealed in the book with strident screaming women with acting about as animated as a wooden puppet on steriods.If you haven't read the book, you may enjoy it as complete fluff. But only if you really beleiuve Sandra Bullock is the next Great Actress. Wait for the video."
1,Run men! Run!,"I watched this movie because I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock and this is just about the only movie of her's I haven't seen. The Ya Ya Sisterhood is just WAY too much of a chick-flick for me. All the women in this movie are nuts. You're left wondering why in the world the two guys in the movie stick around. The guys even look like they hate being in this movie. It's not even funny. The flashbacks are often boring and depressing. Women will love this but if you're a guy just stay away. The worst part of the movie is the use of the ""Ya Ya""s. That alone was incredibly annoying."
5,Ya-Ya's Unite,"I caught a sneak of this film last night & really, really enjoyed it. Sandra Bulloch, Maggie Smith (she should get a Best Supporting), Ashley Judd (hello, Oscar?)and Ellen Bursten are particularly wonderful in conveying ""the Southern way."" I think everyone in the audience could take something away at the conclusion of the film. It's poignant, funny, happy, sad...just a wonderful product from Bette Midler's production company!"
4,Ya-Ya,This is a moving story of how challenging parenthood can be and how the results of poor parenting can leave children in emotional turmoil. It tells of a woman who had a somewhat difficult childhood because of being resented by own mother and how she struggled to raise her own while experiencing a nervous breakdown. The woman's daughter (Bullock) grows up resenting her mother for the way she raised her not realizing all her mother had been through in those days. The story also show how important true friendship is and how it can help us to face our demons and overcome our fears.
5,one of my all time faves,this was a great chick flick. right up there with a walk to remember. well lets start by saying i saw this on its opening day and it is a movie for everyone. Sidda is a frustrated daughter of a alcoholic overly abusive mother. her mothers friends the yayas go to bring sidda back no matter what it takes. it is worth watching. go see now. ya ya rules.
3,Sisterhoods are for the youth,"This is an okay movie. Sidda (Sandra Bullock) and her mother Vivi do not get along, but the Ya-Ya Sisterhood tries to bring them back together. The Sisterhood was started with four girls in 1937. Vivi is one of the members, but she has usually separated herself from the group.Vivi is a bad mother and an alcoholic. She married her husband more out of necessity than love. The sisterhood is fun when they are young, but annoying when they are old. I think it would have been better without them. I liked the scenes about the past better than the present. I think Sandra Bullock was really pretty in this."
2,Packing Problems,I had ordered lots of movies for Christmas presents. They all came in one box and 4 of them had damage to the cases. The center plastic stabilizer that holds the DVD in place was broken and the DVD was sliding all around inside the case. The cases are no longer usable as the DVD won't stay in place. I was not happy with the packaging and the lack of protection. Several of these movies had been banging around in transit. I am most upset by 3 things: 1. I can no longer use the original case to store the movie. 2. The movies were scratched due to being loose inside case. 3. I have never had this problem in ordereing from Amazon before.
5,"Best Buy, Great Service",I couldn't beat the price or the service. I will purchase all my movie orders this way from now on. This was my first time ordering movies online and don't know why I didn't do this years ago. Very happy!
5,YA-YA BABY,"This is definately a DEVINE movie. Great story and one of those that you can declare a ""keeper"". It's on my future purchase list. The South shall rise again."
3,What happened?,"Loved the book, and the movie was okay once I got used to the changes...First of all what happaned to Vivvie's boarding school days, which in my opinion were very important to building her personality...and then Sidalee's wedding? Disappointed by the omission of the two paramount portions of the book..."
3,BLAH BLAH,"This movie (to long to write) was all right. The acting was pretty good. The standout performance was Ashely Judd. Maggie Smith was also good as was Ellen Burstyn, but here character was really stupid and annoying. Her character was a huge drama queen, but it was way too over-the-top. I do not think a mother would burn and cut out picturesw of her daughter no matter how angry she was with her. Sandra Bullock was pretty good, but her accent kept on appearing heavily and reappearing. Maybe it was supposed to have gone away from living in New York. This movie was also a little long. The movie would have been better if they showed mre with Ashley Judd, because she was really good, and her character was interresting. Also they could have shown the aduld children of vivi's and told whose house sandra bullock was staying in. See this movie if you are dying to see it; otherwise, wait until dvd or video."
3,Maybe you have to read the book...,"to get the most out of this film. I found it to be hard to follow and full of holes. Don't get me wrong, the cast did a great job with what they were given, which wasn't an awful lot. It's basically a back and forth journey from the present to the past, with none of the segments being particularly well defined. I must also mention that the older ya-yas were the true stars of this movie. Be prepared to call your Mom when it's over! There was way too much cussing, and when it was over and the credits began to roll, I found myself still staring up at the screen asking, is that it? Not because I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end but because I had so many unanswered questions. It's a true chick-flick, and rightly so. There is a lot of screaming, crying, hormonal hysteria, occasional insanity, and identity crises. Oh yes, and did I mention the cussing?"
5,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"Anyone who has ever been a sister, mother or daughter will love this movie! Great acting all around."
3,Disappointing,"After reading the book, I was so excited to see the movie with some of my favorite actresses. The movie was entertaining but really didn't make sense and was hard to follow. Too bad."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"A real downer that goes nowhere good.The commercials made it look like a comedy, so I watched this movie on tv tonight. Well, it's anything but.It's a hodge-podge of reminicenses about a woman who lost the love of her life early, never gets over it, becomes an alcoholic... while her siblings (hence the sisterhood), subsequent husband (a boring self-appointed martyr) and innocent children suffer right along with her.Ashley Judd gives a good performance, but it's not enough to save this film.My rating: Skip It"
1,Not Even Close!,This is quite possibly the worst book to movie translation. There are so many unbelievably HUGE differences that make the movie absolutely nothing like the book. One of the worst movies I've seen.
1,Another POS,"""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" is one of those movies you'll see and wonder why did I rent this? Hopefully you didn't take the extra step and buy it before viewing it. Buyer's remorse to the tenth power! The movie is about a mother (Ellen Burstyn) and daughter (Sandra Bullock) who have disowned each other and a group of older women's attempts to bring the two together. The movie goes back-and-forth with flashbacks from the 60's and present day. Hitting the phone has never been so much fun! Blast those things for being so loud! The movie tries to make you cry and it works! I was crying so much because I had wasted three dollars for the rental! A terrible movie and one of the worst of 2002."
3,3.5,"I absolutely adore Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd, that's the only reason why I watched this movie. At the end, I wasn't that disappointed but I wasn't thrilled. I have seen much better, not that Bullock and Judd didn't give amazing performances, I just think this could have been better. Firstly, I know it's how the ladies are looking back on the days but Judd should have been in it more, at least had more lines. I loved the wit of Bullock's finance though! It's probably a much better movie for older people, maybe when I'm 30 I'll see it again but there's nothing much I can really say about it."
2,A Waste of Time,"To say that this is a ""chick"" movie is insulting to chicks.If you like stories about gals from the South who drink like fish, talk too much, and act like fools then I guess this is the movie for you. It bears slight resemblance to the book, except it has the same characters. The jumps in time are confusing, the situations the women find themselves in are contrived and implausable, the characters are outrageous, but if this is what floats your boat, and it obviously does some people's, then pop some corn and let your mind go numb."
3,O-O / Ya - Ya / OOPS - Yak !,"I like Sandra Bullock ! But this film was so boring , I should have fallen asleep ... I didn't - this was Christmas Eve ! Why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 ? Because my girlfriend ordered "" Eight Legged Freaks "" just to make up for the torture of watching this very boring , very fake ""film"".I thought that it is a "" chick's movie ""...I watched it ... turned to my girlfriend to say how boring it was ... she was trying to take all of my sleeping pills at once... to avoid my comment...Do I need to say more ?!"
5,Wonderful,Th service on ordering and receiving this product was excellent. Enjoyed viewing the movie even tho it was the second time around.
4,Read the book,"Movie was good but the book was better! Was disappointed that they changed so much, and left so much out. Still a good movie and worth the watch,."
1,Flawed DVD replaced right away,"The DVD had wavy picture and static. Amazon to the rescue. They replaced the video immediately, which impressed me . My out of town guests were able to watch with me as planned. Ya ya Secrets is a wonderful movie especially for us older ladies. I love Amazon. I order with confidence."
1,"Disappointing, to say the least...","I don't know, maybe there's something about this movie that I just don't get. I didn't read the book because, quite frankly, the ""cutesy"" title turned me off. However, when the movie came out I noted (as others have) that the cast was quite respectable. I thought James Garner, Maggie Smith, and Ellen Burstyn weren't likely to waste their time appearing in a negligible vehicle. Having watched the movie, I will say that I definitely don't get how such old pros got themselves involved in making it. In fact, I would suggest a much more descriptive title for the movie (one that might help others understand what they are in for before they sit down to watch it): ""Southern Gothic Meets the Stoogettes in Self-Indulgence Land."" If that sounds good to you (and everyone is certainly entitled to their own tastes), you probably will enjoy this movie. If not, you might enjoy Steel Magnolias, Fried Green Tomatoes, or Driving Miss Daisy a heckuva lot better--I know I did."
3,Nah!-Nah!,"I went to see ""Secrets"" because of the cast moreso than the story, which I read years ago, and because I could relate to having been raised by a drunken mother I need to forgive. The actors did not disappoint but the story does--it's long and dreary and everything ties up a little too neatly in the end.I did enjoy seeing (recognizing!) the chemistry between the grandmother and the mother--the horrible jealously and consequential withholding of love and the devastating consequences for the daughter--long blurry rides on the pity paddywagon. But hey, don't invite her to the wedding!!!"
4,Secret of enjoyment,"Movies are not books. They can't reach in your mind and work it out the way you ""saw"" it when you read. That being said enjoy the great cast and unfolding story as if you'd no idea what was coming and all will be well. I had no trouble staying involved - sorry for the folks who would find this unmoving enough to watch without caffine - it had emotional punch enough for me to have tears in my eyes. Also my husband enjoyed it so it's not just a Chick Flick."
1,A waste of good talent. Forget about it. Read the book.,"Because I had read and enjoyed the book several years ago, I was curious as to the kind of film it would make. It was billed as a comedy but turned out to be a bad soap opera. And any real similarity to the book were just on the surface. It seemed to follow the plot outline, but jumped around in time much too much. And the characters all came out as caricatures.Basically it's a mother-daughter story, with Sandra Bullock cast as the daughter, Sidda, and Ellen Burstyn as the mother, Vivienne. What a waste of good talent! Ashley Judd is the younger Vivienne and does a pretty good job. But the audience hasn't a clue as to why she abuses her children and has a mental breakdown. It all seemed staged and not a bit plausible.As for my recommendation: forget about it. Read the book instead."
2,The magic of nostalgia did not work,"I enjoyed the conversation among ya-ya sisters and, off course; Maggie Smith gives us laugh here and there. Somehow, the magic of nostalgia did not work for me with this movie when they try to describe how the mother has reconciled with her daughter over the tough time they had in the past due to her alcoholism. May be it was beacause I just didn't see the connection between the mother in 40's that Ashley Judd played and the current one."
4,i liked this and i am a man,my wife wanted to see this so we rented the other night and i am glad we did because i also enjoyed it. but movies about family coming to gather and the freindship just touched me. i don't know why this put down so much i think there was some good acting and i alway like most movies james garner is in. i think this this movie was funny and sad at the same time i know my wife was'nt crying alone i had tears rolling down my face also.this movie is'nt just for women it for anyone who enjoys a good movie.
1,Does not seem to work with AXIM 51 running Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC,"I installed driver from disk and everything went just like the directions said. Dell Axim 51 pocket pc registered that software had loaded properly, but when I plugged in the wireless adapter and tried to initiate the config, the STATUS line indicated ""Driver not installed"" and the program summarily ended, kicking me back to my desktop. I called customer support at Linksys and they were not able to offer any assistance. I tried downloading the driver from the Linksys website and it appeared exactly like the build that came with my product installation disk. Behaved the same also, gave the same error - DRIVER NOT INSTALLED. I'm sending it back."
4,wireless on a PDA,"Easy enough to use, install the software and plug it in.There are a couple of small issues with it though:When setting it up, the field for the network id on a WEP connection will not let you enter a long value. It appears to run out of space, at least it stops accepting characters. You have to write it elsewhere and cut/past it in.The power management is poor. The power management setting of on (or even auto) drains the battery. The manual is no help, just repeatedly stating:Power Management is a power saving mode. The lower power consumption may also lower the wireless performance. To enable Power Management, select On. To disable Power Management, select Off.The power LED stay on, even when the PDA hibernates. I have to remove the card to prevent this."
4,Product description need's to be clarified,"Although it has ""OETIO"" on the cover (Operating Engineers Training Institute of Ontario) I never really noticed it until the book came. Not knowing if this is going by the same EXACT standards as what we are using here in the USA I don't think I would have purchased it."
2,"Good for beginners, that's all.","Bought the book, and going to be returning it for a more complete book. If you are a beginner with the Windows 9x interface, and need some handholding, this book is for you. Otherwise, I'd imagine you'd be better off buying a ""Mastering"" book of some sort."
5,A Total Knock Out!,This book is gorgeous. An amazing output by one of todays most admired and followed designers/artists around. This piece of work is surely no longer an insiders' tip but at the same time far from being mainstream. It's a standard all of its own.Outstanding. Five stars. Absolutely recommended. Thank you!
3,not complete,"A nice book, featured with really good design. Depending on the category you can have more or less choices of objects without a real criteria. It probably needs an extension with other elements of everyday life now missing. Good quality for the price."
3,Helpful resource,"Helpful resource, although included font doesn't have many useful characters. Clip art is OK - good concept but not as awesome as I'd first hoped."
2,Not so hott,The quality of the tee is not a good as i hoped. i washed and wore it only once and the writing is already starting to fade.
3,"""Glide"".","An ordinarily satisfactory release from talented Tom Cochrane, but this is no ""Mad Mad World"" by any stretch of imagination, but has a few gems interpersed within this album. My favourite song from this album is track 2 ""Glide"": Life's a highway it's been said, Sometimes the road gets rough it hurts my head...,Tom Cochrane sings, great song! Other notable songs are ""The Party's Not Over"", ""White Horse"", ""Didn't Mean"", ""Rough And Tumble"", ""Out Of My Head"", ""Deep Breath"" & ""Northern Star"". Overrall quality of the release is satisfactory but well below par that of the landmark 1991 album release ""Mad Mad World"". It's rather mellow, just a bit better than ""X-ray Sierra"" album (his weakest). Hoping for a better next release by the talented Tom Cochrane!"
4,"Tom Cochrane ""No Stranger""","More very listenable, good song writing from Tom Cochrane of Red Rider fame. I liked this album more with each play which is always a good sign. ""No Stranger"" has a light rock, somewhat country music feel, which is consistent with Cochrane's tendency away from his Red Rider mainstream rock work of the 80's."
3,Smaller than it looks,"Just received this item, purchased as a Christmas gift for my nephew. Another reviewer mentioned that the drawers were somewhat small for all the pieces. That appears correct, and I was surprised at the overall size of the item. I didn't think to measure, but 12"" is not what I would consider a normal size board. The size will probably work out to be nice for storage, but it wasn't what I expected."
3,Overpriced for quality,Quality of this product was not what I expected based on many purchases with/via amazon.com. NOTE: the game pieces do not fit in the drawers without a lot of patient arranging for the chess/checker pieces and the two drawers open on the same gameboard. For the price I innocently assumed there would be at least a fabric bag to slide the gameboard into to protect the wood if one needs to store or transport the unit.
3,Not What I Wanted,"It is a hard to fine lure, the smaller version know as the Devils Tooth pick isn't made anymore but Smithwick is still in business. The company is owned by another company who decided to discontinue that model. I think the wooden lures have certain qualities about them that attract fish. The lower tones emitted by wood travel longer distance in the water. All in all the larger bait is acceptable but not what I was expecting."
2,Ho Hum,"Okay book of this particular genre. Tries to be suspenseful, but fails miserably. Don't buy, check out at the library."
2,she can't sing...,"Okay, I have to admit, this song is pretty catchy. ...But her voice is horrible! She cant sing. It's so bad that it disrupts the song.What more can I say?"
2,Not what I ordered,"The item I received and the item described DO NOT MATCH. I purchased this cd single only because of the supposed duet with Esthero (""I Feel You""), as described in the song listing here. Only the cover art is the same (grinning Nelly). The REAL song list is: 1. I'm Like a Bird 2. Party [Reprise] 3. My Love Grows Deeper 4. I'm Like a Bird [cd rom video]. NO ""I Feel You"" with Esthero!!!! They should change the description so customers aren't disappointed."
2,Horrid,"This movie is awful. Yeah, I understand what it's about, and yeah it's funny at times. However, the only thing that could save this horrible movie would have been to put Dominique Swain in the role of Caroline McDuffy. And the only reason I gave it 2 stars was b/c of her. This movie got worse and worse as it went on, and I can't believe I spent the money and time to rent it and sit through the god-awful 2 hours it took to finish it. The idea of the movie is different, granted, but it didn't have to be told in such a stupid way."
1,This was pure garbage,"Do not follow that BS review on the dvd that says it's funny cause this film was just plain BAD. I'm not even going to go into the fact that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen and that it's a love story between a girl and a....hmmm I really can't say cause I'll get flamed for it so I'll just put into simpler words for you... DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! It had a very cheesy storyline, Christina Richi got on my friggin' nerves ont this one too and was just a really lame love story that I won't go into details with...This doesn't deserve 5 stars BUT it does deserve 5 stars for Garbage...Cause that is what this film is...Peace"
2,Completly forgettable,"Don't waste your money to buy or rent this movie. The only good characters were Cici and pumpkin, the rest was dull. The movie moves way to slow and the acting is uneventful. Unless you are a big fan of Christina Ricci or love moves of this genre I suggest you skip it and spend your time more wisely."
1,"Trying to hard to be ""indy""","As another reviewer below said, I gave up on the film in the EXACT same spot she did....when Ricci's character is walking through the campus and gets disgusted by the garbage, rats and a dead bird.There is a point where some indy films decide that quirky scenes make up for a lack of plot or character devolopment. Many, MANY things in this film felt rushed, the plotting bordered on schizophrenic (the filmmakers seemed to have a clear vision of ""point A"" and ""point B"", but no clue how to drive the ""car"" between the two points) and even though you can tell Ricci's character is trying to redeem herself, you have NO clue WHY she is doing so. A few minutes spent with her ""special"" charge is supposed to make her entire life turn around? I just don't get it, and after 45 minutes I didn't want to anymore. (and isn't it interesting two people both gave up at the exact same time?)Save your money, and your time."
4,"Is it Just Bad, or is it Funny?","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was not at all what I expected... it was much better than just a tear-jerker coming-of-age film about a sorority girl and a ""challenged"" man. It is all satirical and pokes fun at sororities and even itself. The parts that seem really bad are hilarious if you go into it realizing that it is intentional. The car crash scene cracked me up. The actual footage of the car bursting into flame was obviously from some other movie or just stock footage. I think that the people who reviewed this movie poorly just took it too seriously. You have to laugh at these characters. If you thought that they seemed like real people and not exaggerated stereotypes, then you missed the point. Really."
1,"Not One, but ZERO stars","This movie is terrible. I could almost feel my brain melting... that's how bad of a viewing experience it was. When we rented this, I was excited to see it because I like Christina Ricci as an actress, but this was SUCH a TOTAL MASSIVE LETDOWN. Not heartwarming at all. The characters were cold, flat and unlikeable. It also seemed rather insulting/offensive to disabled people. Overall, I was completely dumbfounded at this hideous excuse for a film."
3,Just Rent It,"I really liked the audacity of this film, and its thematic richness. But it ultimately didn't quite work for me. There was something unwieldy and graceless about the whole thing; too many scenes suffered from a distractingly awkward melding of serious and comedic elements.I tend to like challenging or quirky films, cinema with the guts to defy conventions. So there was much in this movie to keep me watching. I only wish my enjoyment of it hadn't been interrupted every few minutes by another clumsy ill-conceived scene."
5,Hilarious movie--too bad people don't understand the humour,"It's sad to see people be offended by the movie and not find it absolutely hilarious. It's black comedy--the stereotypes are designed to make you think and reflect. The acting is incredible and the performances by the supporting cast really help make this a strong movie. If you like movies that make you think,laugh,and then say ""Oh now I get it"",you should like this one.just one question: Where on earth can i buy the soundtrack?"
3,Charming concept but not developed well,"This came so close to being a great movie, it was a great premise and had some well-conceived scenes, but it just never develops any depth. The transformation of Ricci's character from spoiled sorority girl to idealistic humanitarian is just not well done, not believable in the slightest.And what's even more poorly developed is how in the heck Ricci's character ever falls in love with the retarded guy in the first place. They never show him doing anything, never saying anything, never never is any action of his offered up to the viewer as particularly charming when he is around her. Therefore her love for him is not believable.They blew it, because they really had something here, I think.A charming concept that didn't get handled in a way it could have."
3,Ricci takes another risk....,"Christina Ricci is a brilliant actress and a young woman willing to tackle risky roles that leading commercial actresses would turn down in a heart beat. She has made big budget films (Addams Family, Sleepy Hollow) and smaller independent films (The Opposite of Sex). In all her roles, she is always intriguing and fun to watch. ""Pumpkin"" is a strange film that deals with a taboo subject---the relationship between a special needs person and a so-called ""normal"" person. While I applaude the directors and star of the film for looking at this delicate issue, it was like watching a bizarre combination of ""Legally Blonde"" and the Mel Gibson film ""Tim"". I wouldn't call it a great film but it is definitely a movie that will get a good deal of conversation at the water cooler or with friends. Check it out, especially if you enjoy the fine acting of Ms. Ricci. She never disappoints."
5,Life is funny... and beautiful,"Pumpkin is not a hilarious comedy-- and if it was, I think I would have hated it. It is very amusing -- but its greatness lies in its freshness as a story. It simply is a story about how life is so strange. So, the only reason I laughed was because life is funny. As ridiculous as the characters act, they still hold so much truth. Real people are this ridiculous! If you're looking for a story you haven't seen before -- you need to see Pumpkin ... and the soundtrack is amazing, too."
2,It's no pumpkin patch of a movie.,"Pumpkin starring Christina Ricci is an uneven, confusing, and strange little film. I heard some great things about Pumpkin and I was excited to see it but it was not what I expected at all. Yes, I knew what the concept of the film was, a young sorority girl who falls in love with a mentally challenged student. This film was just too stereotypical for me, it wasn't funny or that witty. I was extremely disappointed with the outcome of the film, too bad Pumpkin wasn't something special, two hours of nothing, that's all it was to me. I'd skip this one, what was the point of this film anyway, to make fun of handicapped people? Avoid this at all cost."
4,The edited version cuts out 20 minutes,"This movie was great, but this version is missing 20 minutes that have a lot of great stuff in them. Just a warning."
4,One of Ricci's best roles,This independant film starring christina ricci is well worth watching. it's about a college girl in who helps train challenged athletes and ends up falling in love with the athlete she's helping. it's a very touching story and a good film.
2,"Forced, but still somewhat watchable","Pumpkin stars Christina Ricci who is as good as usual in her role as a sorority girl. The movie should get some credit for trying to be a satire, I guess I respect any movie that attempts to shed some light on appropiate targets. However, it misses the point entirely, and is incoherent and unfocused. The filmmakers actually started on an interesting premise and didn't know what to do with it. And a sub plot with the smothering mother of Pumpkin involving the almost exploitation of her son with the ""Special Olympics"" type games should've been developed to fruition."
2,She looks REALLY GOOD. The rest of it doesn't.,"Hard to know exactly what made this one fall apart: the writing, the direction, or the editing? My guess is that it's a little bit of all three. What is admittedly an interesting premise gets pretty much ruined by a completely botched pace. Everybody's sense of right and wrong does a complete 180 at the same moment, but I'll be darned if I can say why. Oh well. It beats Desert Blue."
3,Someone got it right,"Wow. What a mix of perceptions and opinions from all reviewers. Read other reviews for plot details.SPOILER. I think that the reviewer J. F. Rick got it right with a possible explanation of the filmmaker's methods: ""My interpretation is simple: Carolyn succeeds at suicide. The rest of the movie, after the suicide attempt, is simply her imagined happy ending as she slips into the beyond.""Makes sense. I'm satisfied with that insight about the movies uneven and ludicrous 2nd half. A lot of it is a metaphor and dream exaggeration.Obviously this movie is not for everyone. I would not rank it a ""must see,"" but I enjoyed it when my other options were limited."
1,Rotten Pumpkin,"For the first 2/3 of this film, it wasn't bad. Christina Ricci was interesting to wacth, as always, and any film with Brenda Blethyn already has a few points in its favor. However, the last fifteen minutes of this film contained the absolute worst dialogue and situations I've ever experienced. For example, the vain star tennis player drives off a cliff, his car burst into flames, then he is next seen in the hospital, unscathed, but paralyzed. Within a month, he is coaching the very special needs individuals he loathed. Hmm. Don't waste your time or money on this drivel. Sorry, Brenda. Sorry, Christina."
3,Still Thinking about it,"I'm a fan of Ricci's and decided to rent Pumpkin. I'm still not so sure what exactaly the point was (and i really pick movies apart). Caroline McDuffy (Ricci) has a perfect life and then falls in love with Pumpkin a mentally challenged boy. She claims that he understands her...when really he didn't know anything about her. She just seemed to fall in love too fast and for no reason. We really didn't get to know Pumpkin at all either. The 60s fashions/traditions were a good move. I took it as a symbol for the lives the charcters were trying to live, although this took place in the present day. Ricci was great, and i actually laughed a lot. I would recommend it."
1,revolving genres,"Christina Ricci, whose performances I normally enjoy, couldn't save this movie from its' shattered existence.The movie centers around Ricci's perfect, shallow, sorority sister character, who falls in love with a mentally challenged young man. Filled to the brim with jokes about ""retards and minorities,"" the movie tries, but falters. A satire? Sometimes, but most of the time I felt this movie struggling under the weight of what it was trying to do. In fact, I'm not quite sure the directors knew what they were doing. I found myself questioning the intent throughout.Approach with trepidation.If you're interested in seeing these risque ideas played out in a more effective manner, rent Storytelling instead."
1,HA HA HA!,"If I could reveiw this movie lower I would have. Whoever liked this movie must love horrible dialougue and acting. The [things] she say's is embarassing. If I were Ricci I'd stay out of the movie buisness until this one blew over. I'll just put it this way, it blowed bad, way worse then I could even imagine. I won't waste anymore time writing because I wasted too much time watching the awful movie."
1,Directors need to go back to sch & pay attention this time!,"An absolute horrible waste of time. I never did figure out what the author and director were trying to do. I spent most of the film feeling sorry for the actors for getting caught in such a badly written, totally out of touch, non-funny, non-poignant, piece of garbage. Total lack of character development, a plot that at times could be understood only by someone who grew up in southern California, complete inability to bring any intensity to the camera from any of the cast, these guys (the Directors) need to go back to school and pay attention this time!Don't be caught up in the idea (like I was) that the plot could be marvelous....it's a good idea very badly done. Don't waste your time."
1,"THIS MOVIE WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN ""REAL LIFE""!!!!","WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ALL YOU PEOPLE GIVING THIS MOVIE A GOOD REVIEW???? THIS IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE!! IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN IT 0 STARS I WOULD HAVE!! TAKE IT FROM A GUY WHO WOULD KNOW....I MYSELF AM ""DISABLED"" AND I WAS GOING OUT WITH A ""NORMAL"" GIRL AND AFTER ALMOST 4 YEARS TOGETHER SHE DUMPED ME BECAUSE I WAS ""DISABLED"" EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS FINE WITH IT IN ALL THAT TIME, COME TO FIND OUT HER FAMILY WAS AGAINST OUR RELATIONSHIP FROM THE START. SO TO SUM UP........THIS MOVIE WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN ""REAL LIFE""!!!!P.S.DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!! 0 STARS!!!"
2,Are there 2 versions??? I want to see the other one,"I read the reviews before renting this DVD and it had mixed reviews.. I was wondering is there two versions. The version I seen was predictable. shamefully poorly directed. and I was thinking 1/2 hr into it ""Glad I didnt waste 8.50 at the theater""I believe this is what happens when banks invest in movies instead of stocks. There is always a buck to be made regardless of how bad a movie is. .. well i digress.. anyway this is yet ""ANOTHER"" coming of age movie.. and the funny parts are predictable.. so much so they fail to be funny anymore. Very little in the way of character developement.. so muckh so you can start watching the movie at any point and pick up on it. The movie is entertaining enough to be a made for tv movie.. This is definetly not a movie for the collection...maybe the trash collection. Keep your cash or rent something funny like Sorority Boys."
3,Bjork song?,"I didn't mind the movie, I'm usually into suspense thrillers, but this movie wasn't bad. The song that's playing when she runs away to the tech school sounds like Bjork, and it's about going away or something. I was just wondering if anyone knew that song"
1,Please do not waste your money on this movie,"This was horrible. I don't know how it got rated as hysterically funny or even in the comedy category. Stupid? yes. Funny? NoThis movie was insulting to handicapped persons and overweight persons (of which I am neither). It was insensitive, stupid, poorly filmed, whatever a movie shouldn't be, Pumpkin was. What Pumpkin was NOT was entertaining.Please do not waste your money buying this movie. Don't even waste your money renting it (like I did)."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"Not even worth one star. I have never been so discusted in my whole life. I am in shock that anyone could think this movie is either realistic, touching, or meant to be taken seriously. It wasn't funny, but I found it in the comedy section. If I hadn't rented it I would have broken the disc and thrown it right in the trash. Please do not watch this movie unless you want your intelligence to be insulted by this extremely sickening movie. The story might have had a small chance of being pulled off, but the people who produced this film have managed to create a disgrace, and the acting was so pathetic I wanted to scream!!! Nothing in this movie was believable."
1,Am I missing something here?.........,"I read on the cover and it says is hystaraly funny? What the hell is wrong with you people. This movie should have bin in drama. There was like nothing funny about a sorrity girl falling in love with a mental challenged person.I dont really find that extreamly funny. To the idiot who said if you dont laugh youre lame, shut the hell up cause if you sad films like this funny than you have no taste in movies. The movie was quit borring nothing special.I didnt like it at all. Not only that......was this a chick flick?Anyways dont get this garbage just cause the cover says its very funny. Liars........."
4,Pretty Good,"This movie was pretty good for the most part. At times it was very unrealistic and dissapointing. It was made for the Sundance Film festival which explains it's quirkiness. But if you are a fan of independent movies and the Sundance Channel then you will deffinately love the movie Pumpkin. Basically a two Sorority's are competing against eachother for a contest and one which is lead by Carolyn (Ricci) have the job of coaching mentally challenged athletes. Crolyn ends up with a mysterious young gentleman Pumpkin whom opens up new realizations to her life. This movie is weird, dark, and amusing."
4,Not for the literal-minded,"As with most things brilliant, this film is misunderstood by the simple. If you take this film and the love between Caroline Duffy and Pumpkin Romanoff literally, you should justifiably be offended and disgusted. The metaphor in a nutshell -- Pumpkin represents pain. When Caroline is finally introduced to pain and embraces all it has to teach her, she sheds the vacuous shell of a person she was and begins her evolution into a truly thinking, feeling, and enlightened being. That's my kind of love story. Oh, and did I mention it's hilarious?"
5,Awesome!,"This movie, although practical, has hidden meaning and is a real eye opener. It teaches that the most unexpected people can have the greatest beauty on the inside."
2,Not recomended,"I thought this was an amazing pillow! well you can never trust items with only 1 exellent review on items...This pillow its way tooo big!!! the ratio between your neck and you shoulder should keep your head and spine straight but this pillow makes your neck hurt ""unless you are really tall! 1,90 mts and the distance between your head and shoulder is far away dont buy this, I should have bought a normal memory foam""it feels like sleeping with a ballon"
3,Fretless AZM - Astral Cinema,"Astral Cinema, the fourth Fretless AZM album on Holistic Recordings, leaves behind some of the noodling that marked his earlier works and instead goes for more straightforward tracks. The opening track, ""Framed in Funk,"" is succinct and clean, which makes it more effective. ""Thought for Food"" has multiple lines vying for melody (plus some ghostly noises), while ""Steppin on the Cracks"" has a thoughtful groove and some nice guitar work. ""Big Wheel Butterflies"" adds some modal melodies to keep things mysteriously interesting. The final track, ""Out House,"" is pretty gentle, but nonetheless pleasing. Check it out."
4,Use different 3-D glasses,Many of the reviews here complain that the anaglyph conversions are misaligned. This is somewhat true of a few pictures. The real problem is that the 3-D glasses provided with the book are just plain terrible and the images suffer considerable 'bleed-through.' Use standard red/cyan 3D glasses and most of the pictures are magnificent.
2,Delusion!,"Harold Lloyd was a good 3D photographer and managed the 3D very well, only too well I cannot say the same on whom prepared the photos for the book.I worked several years using stereo photos, I take stereo photos for hobby and I must say that the 3D photos in the book are bad formed and printed.Often they are misalligned and the colours of the glasses ""lens"" don't match with the printed colours.You may try to use green-red glasses, or perhaps it should be better if the two stereo photos were printed side by side (as in the ""3D-Hollywood"") and not so badly merged as in this book."
3,"Great photos, too bad the 3-D is badly reproduced","Lots of great photos and some good stories, but the the 3-D reproductions don't look/work very well. Compared to a book like the excellent Civil War in Depth, the 3-D is terrible. Side-by-side images is a much better way to reproduce stereo photographs than the botched red/green separation in this book."
1,I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this,"The anaglyph conversions were poor, to put it nicely.(Honestly, I've seen better in TV Guide.)I'm a stereo aficianado, and was quite disappointed that none of the original stereo photos were included.Also, not all of the photos were 3-D, and I found it quite annoying to be putting on and taking off the glasses every third page or so."
3,Not as good as Harold Lloyds 3D Hollywood,"I expected this book to be as good as Harold Lloyd's other 3D book (3D Hollywood). It was not.This book uses 3D anaglyphs (viewed with 2 color glasses) instead of 3D parallel pairs. Color saturation in anaglyphs is not as good as 3D parallel pairs. Another problem is that many of the stereo images suffer from ""windows violations"". This is where the eye is forced to diverge to look at distant objects while trying to focus at the media surface where the images really reside. There are also images where an object appears in one color but is blocked (and does not appear) in the other color. Both circumstances make it difficult to focus the eyes when viewing the image.On the other hand, the ladies are very pretty."
3,pretty good book,"this is a pretty good book,dig the pictures&the concept along with the storys.the texture of printing the pictures isn't done as well,but the inital pictures&whatnot are cool.a interesting book nevertheless."
2,a letdown,"Harold Lloyd may have been a brilliant man but they clearly didn't know much about 3-D photography back then. The stereoscopic displacement just doesn't work quite right--the image never really aligns well, and many of the images resist being resolved by the eyes."
2,not enough 3d,"I was dissapointed in this book as The stereo images on the whole were just not good enoughas,as well as being to few. The book quality was good, I feel this book would have been have sold in one of the many cheap book stores."
1,titilation for perverts (& Ghosts),"poor quality photo's. Very tame. A guy I know who ran away from two 'forward' girls on a train once may buy this. Shame, could have been a cracker."
3,good 4 what it is,i bought this 2 relive my 20s again. they whine a little but the music is good. i guess being married with kids prevents me from feeling the loneliness that used 2 grip my life. sound musicianship.
5,Good rockin!,"Dinosaur Jr.'s sound falls between REM's classic Murmur and Nirvana (the band). Almost all the noise of Sonic Youth but not as abstract. This album is certainly one of their best. I own just about every one of their efforts, and they consistently reveal good artistry. True about the singing being far from perfect, but listen to the music. I think you will find that it rocks."
5,BEST OF ALL TIME,"This album is up there with Bee Thousand as the best of all time. Buy this, crank it up, and rock out to this!!! J. Mascis is such a good songwriter. Though they sort of start to sound alike, that's a good thing cause it's all like one big song (which is, by the way, the big secret to making a perfect album. but keep it on the DL)"
3,5 star album... 1 star reissue.,"Merge really dropped the ball on their reissues of the first three Dinosaur Jr. CDs.For whatever reason, the era appropriate ""Show Me The Way"" was replaced with ""Just Like Heaven"", which was recorded two years later. ""Just Like Heaven"", as well as all the b-sides from the single, would fit better as bonus tracks for Bug.Don't get me wrong, the album tracks are as good as they ever were. It's just that a reissue of this landmark album deserves better attention to detail."
1,"Biased, poorly-written","Totally biased, written to make people and development look disgusting and the poor animals the heroes. This is written by adults with adult themes, designed to brainwash children agains 'bulldozers and chain saws.' People bad; nature good."
3,High in the Clouds,"There should have been an age restriction. I started to read to my 4yr grandson, and he was terrified! So I am saving it until he gets older."
2,Not his best work,"I'm a McCartney fan as much as anyone, but......I'm sorry to say, this is not Paul's best work. The undeveloped characters (and there were a plethora of them)reminded me of the work of my 5th grade students, as did the writing of action-for-action's sake. I'll continue to buy all his music though!"
1,Gretsch review,"Since my name is Dinah Gretsch and I have 13 grandchildren, how would I be able to buy my grandchildren this book, when Evil Gretsch is referred to? Wonder how that name came up, since it is one of the most popular Guitar lines in the world and Paul is also one of the most popular guitar players?"
1,"Badly written, full of nonsense, bad jokes and cliches -- wouldn't have been published if it weren't by Sir McCartney","My son was given this book for Christmas. I didn't notice who it was by, just started reading it to my son, and then looked to see who the author was because it was so bad. I feel badly for Philip Ardagh because as a genuine writer of children's books, I'm sure he did what he could to make the book readable. I don't think Sir McCartney was taking many suggestions."
3,Tara's better on her own,"I am a huge fan of Tara MacLean, loved ""Silence"" and ""Passenger,"" and wanted to give Shaye a try. I was pretty disappointed in this album, maybe just because it didn't feel like enough Tara. It sounded very mainstream pop-rockish, and the lyrics just didn't have the poetry of the aforementioned albums. I loved the haunting sounds of Tara's solo albums, and this one just didn't grab me. Seemed a little too bland."
4,'Subversive Southerner' is a must-read,"'Subversive Southerner' is a must-read for anyone interested in southern history or in the social and cultural upheavals of the 50s and 60s. It's a riveting story of personal transformation and courage in the face of unrelenting persecution by authorities, and a reminder of how fragile and how precious are our civil liberties. Anne Braden is a heroine-- dedicated, single-minded in her pursuit of civil rights, but compassionate and always interested in individuals. There's plenty of bombings, arrests, and HUAC subpoenas to keep you turning pages,and lots of quotes, oral-history style, from major figures from the 50s and 60s. It's well-written--Fosl is an expert interviewer and very good writer."
4,Good but not Great,"This is the first Dead Video that i ever bought, and im quite impressed. They did such a great job on sugar magnolia on this DVD that song alone was worth the price. They missed alot of really good songs though like China Cat Sunflower and Casey Jones though. Plus i must be the only one but I loved the special effects they were soooo trippy. Everytime i have ppl over they always want to wacth it just for the special effects."
5,But - I miss the Dylan sets!,"The Oakland show was my second Dead show. I got ""on the bus"" in Eugene - went to see Bob Dylan, LOVED the live Dead experience. Too bad they couldn't get clearance to put the third sets and encores with Dylan on these concerts (of course, then they would probably be two separate releases).Memories -""doses - get your ice cold doses!""Bobby going nuts on ""Hell in a Bucket""- ""least I'm enjoyin' the ride!""The low-budget special effects on the Oakland A's big Jumbotron behind the stage - the colors would change, and I would change them back in my head.A woman having a bummer trip in front of me on the ground - tore my heart out!Frisbee in the parking lot for hours after the show.The eyeball rolling back and forth across the dashboard of our vehicle as we drove south to where we were crashing - with the California Highway Patrol following us for a few miles before passing us by."
3,Bobbie's gay apparel,The music is somewhat muted a.k. trendless but the star of the show has to be Bob's short shorts. We love to laugh at Bobbies apparent gay side that he shows every once in awhile. Big thumbs up Bobbie!
3,Bob Weir's cut-off short-shorts will make you turn away...,"Seriously, the music is great. Like others, I could do without the weirdo special effects, but I can live with them. But those shorts .. my God, it's like watching a gay porno. They're hideous. And it's two shows, two nights apart. Through the first one I kept thinking ""well, the second show will be fine because he won't have on those shorts."" But.. lo and behold, he wore the same damn ugly shorts for both shows! The best moment has to be right at first when Weir is having trouble tuning his guitar. He's been a professional musician for 20 years at that point, and he can't tune his guitar. Then he acts like it's the tuner's fault and gives it a heave. Meanwhile, Jerry is laughing at him. Of course, we don't really know if he's laughing at Weir's ineptitude or because of those silly damn shorts he's wearing..."
5,The little show that roared !!!,"Wow, it always amazes me the amount of talent and incredible dedication and caring there exists in this world. In this video you will see it in abundance. I'd love to see this show on television for my children on a regular basis. The attention to details and truth is great. Very informative too and a very cute format. This is a highly reccomended video. A+ !!"
3,"Good Primer, provides little analysis","This book is a good primer but contains little analysis or original ideas. It does a good job on giving a brief historical background on several examples of the sexual revolution, without getting very deep into any of it. Chapters devoted to television programming do little more than summarize episodes and state that they were groundbreaking, mentioning media examples referring to them as such, but does little to analyze the effect on society. A good, light, book for those who don't know much on the sexual revolution, but a better book would be David Allyn's Make Love Not War."
4,2003 malibu heater AC controller,"I had a hard time finding the right product. Actual pictures were not available. The first item had to be sent back because it was the wrong item. The product is what I had expected. I read that these controllers don't last very long. However, they are easy to install. And are worth one car payment over a three year period if that is the case."
5,best!,"dude, if you don't have this, you're blowin' it. milo goes to college is the best record by the best band ever. the other stuff is just a bonus cup."
5,"If you are interested in Hopper, DO NOT miss this book!","This is one of the most intelligent and interesting books on Hopper I've read. And I have a good-sized collection of books on this American artist because he's my favorite.Not only are there rarer paintings and etchings in here not often included in coffee table books on Hopper, but author Kranzfelder shows his influence on photography, and shows the influence of other artists (notably Degas) on Hopper. Kranzfelder puts paintings and photos on one page, and the particular example of Hopper's work on the other so you can see the comparison side by side.The text is also interesting and full of rare facts and a good analysis as well. If you want a great book about Hopper's work, this is one of the best I have seen. HIGHLY recommended."
5,IT'S A HOPPER!,"I have read the FRENCH translation of this book,and i enjoyed it,even if the approach often is on the intellectual side.No AMERICAN art in the first half of the previous century gets near that man, who visualized his country with a personnal perception.The paintings of HOPPER often gets to you in their quest of lonelyness.PEOPLE IN THE SUN for instance is fascinating.The most interesting aspect about HOPPER,is that his paintings are about the persistance of vision;the way one can try to read his mind."
3,Kids Needed a Lot of Help but Lots of Fun Too,My 5 and 7 year old needed lots of help to make the spa products but it was a fun activity for all of us to do together.
4,Scientific Explorer Spa Science,"My daughter loves this kit. We made soap and she was so excited and uses the soap each night at bath time. We did have to add a lil bubble bath to the solution to get the appropriate formula/lather. Otherwise, the bar would serve as an exfoliater, not that soapy."
4,How adventurous are you?,"If you don't mind helping your child make a banana scrub for your feet and an oatmeal mask for your face, you will have fun with this kit. It presents chemistry at its simplest in the form of spa products and if that whets an interest in mixing things and seeing what happens, that's the idea. You do make a mess but cleaning up is part of learning and we cleaned up together."
3,This was ok...,"This was a good project for the bath, however, the rose pedals are not the best thing for the actual bathtub! And, I would have liked more fragrances than peppermint and lavender. But, not a bad toy."
3,It's okay,We did the first experiment and I had to get extra baking soda from my pantry to finish it. My daughter had fun with it but for the price it should have enough supplies to cover ALL experiments in it!
2,Not worth the money!!!,"My daughter got this for Christmas...What a joke! The box looks so fun but the materials are lack thereof. The kits contains some ingredients but most of the stuff you must get yourself. Basically a cool box with an instruction guide. We opened it thinking we were going to make soap or bath foam..no not without tons of other ingredients...my daughter was disappointed!!! We purchased other kits, basically the same...don't waste your money when you can go online and get the same recipes."
2,Go to a craft store instead,"Unless this is majorly on sale, this is not worth the money. For a scrub, they give you oatmeal but you need yogurt and lemon juice. For the face mask, you need to combine yogurt and honey. I would have rather gotten a kit with more functional ingredients at a craft store or bought a book with recipes instead."
4,Good Clean Fun,"Spa Science is probably more of a recipe than a science experiment, but is still alot of fun. Girls mix fragrances and bases into fun bath prodcuts. Some fizz and release bubbles (carbon dioxide-hense the science part). My 10 yr old dughter enjoys mixing things and creating new blends of ingredients, so this kit was right up her alley. Alot of fun for all girls. It may transfer into an interest in science, but science is not the main focus of the kit."
4,"Fun, but needs more stuff","This is a good concept, but it seems like more should be included in the kit. You can make a facial and some bath fizzy things...but not a whole lot else. However, the experiments it did come with worked."
5,Best toy ever,Almost every thing you need is in the kit.every thing is very relaxing my friends and I play with the kit all the time.
2,Science? What science?,"I read the other reviews and bought it anyhow. There really is no science to this at all. There's also no real fizz to the fizz balls you make for the bath. Directions are poor -- to the bath salts you can add any herbs of your choice, but they give no guidance on which herbs might blend well with the lavender or peppermint oils. Then, there's getting the herbs out of the tub and out of your hair....There are not enough ingredients even to make one of each item discussed in the directions. Rather disappointing, actually."
1,Hardly science,"Outside of the sodium bicarbonate and citric acid bath fizzes, this can hardly be called science. A total waste of money, and a Christmas disappointment to my science-loving daughter. This is really just an expensive make your own spa-in-a-box."
3,Good with Additional Materials,"I would say that this product would have made a better book than kit. The kit does not include enough materials for all the experiments. My daughter was very excited by creating the spa items, but had to add a lot of science behind the projects which was lacking. We took the formulas and bought the needed ingredients to create a more full fun / educational experience."
2,Won't stay on,"I put this on, as tight as I could get it, and it falls down my leg when I run. I returned it. The McDavid one stays on and provides better support."
2,It's ok.....,It didn't say on the description that it doesn't come with a frame or anything. I'm still searching for a frame that matches it and fits it correctly.
4,EGAD this thing is bright,"Bought this for my brother in law, who lives out in the countryside. He already had a spotlight, but nothing like this monster. It has two settings, low and high. The low setting is quite nice, and the high setting is unbelieveably brilliant. I was a bit surprised by the size of the light. It is about the size of a standard tool box. It is not uncomfortably heavy, but it does include a shoulder strap to help carry it over longer distances. The casing is very sturdy."
3,Born in the UK,Heard them live so I had to get the CD. Not bad - definitely not Bewilderbeast but has a few great songs.
5,Excellent Cd,"My german professor has introduced me to these guys. If you want a break from the typical mainstream pop music like N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, this is THE album to start with (along with Sehnsucht by Rammstein) My favorite tracks are Soul Therapy and Disneyland. I really wish these guys would release an album in this country because I beleive they will make it big."
5,The IFR Big Picture made easy,"I like Rod Machado?s Instrument Pilot?s Survival Manual 2nd edition because his book describes the techniques, procedures and more importantly, the reasoning behind them. Learning to fly on instruments is so detail oriented that for many getting the big picture only happens just before the checkride. But we learn better when we can understand the purpose behind doing something. If you are learning to fly on instruments or you are already instrument rated and want to gain more insights about instrument flying and weather Machado?s book is the one to buy. D Schick, Master Flight Instructor"
5,Rod Machado's Instrument Pilot's Survival Manual,"Mr. Machado's instrument book has been a key resource in our IFR training programs since its first publishing in 1991. Our students delight in the author's writing style combining humor with substance. In operating our school, I depend on authors like Rod to help equip our students with the highest possible level of aeronautical knowledge which in turn enables them to make sound inflight decisions. I particularily appreciate the exceptional manner in which Rod teaches the proper use of approach lighting systems pursuant to FAR 91.175.Mark Wilson, Owner, IFR Flight Training School, Austin, Texas"
5,Learning is Fun and Effective With Rod Machado,"I own several of Rod Machado's books and some tapes. As I now prepare for my instrument rating, I am pleased he has updated his ""Survival"" guide and I thus replaced my older version which was handed down to me by another student (The new one has incorporated the glass panel technolgies while maintaining its ""to the point"" elegance.While Machado is known for his humor, it is his clarity of instruction that I most value. It seems like he is my CFII in the right seat and I appreciate having his practical and friendly instruction. The key is, that while I read everything aviation I can get my hands on, it is Rod Machado's lessons with laughter that help me to remember what I need to fly safely and have fun.I really use this book (as the dog-eared coffee stained pages will attest) and I am not sure there is a better instructional aviation writer as he slices to the stuff that is actually used in the plane."
3,"Good info, but not my cup of tea.","Machado has become known as a humorous aviation pilot. Sometimes this may be good, but too often it feels like he's always trying to put something ""cute"" or ""funny"" in there, even when he doesn't have anything worth putting there. I would have preferred it if it had tried to amuse me less.There's info here for the new instrument pilot, and a little for the more knowledgeable. If you've read much and subscribed to IFR, etc., then save your money."
2,"not too funny, not too organized","Machado's schtick is funny here and there, but elsewhere is an annoying distraction. The biggest problem though is how disorganized the book is. The chapters just follow a stream-of-consciousness ordering, with nothing to tie them together except for a clever little quip. There are lots of good tips in there, but it's not a *book*."
3,"Look nice, but rather cheaply made.","I'll start off by saying I'm a little over the recommended weight for these, but I doubt that had much of an impact.The fabric is nice and soft, and they're certainly opaque enough, but the bows are very loosely and messily connected (by a single stitch), and the frills around the top have many loose threads, one of the frills even started unraveling.Maybe I'm asking for too much, but I expected a bit more for the price."
4,Tights,"comes as shown. one size fits all. i'm 5'11 and they were up to thighs. if short, may have to overlap tights by heel so they dont come up to the butt. would recommend!"
3,Cute But Not Very Durable,"While these thigh highs are adorable and were great for a Halloween costume, the bows fell off during the very first wash. The actual hose have held up very well with no runs."
4,Super Soft Fabric,"I love the feel of the fabric and the ruffles and bows are so cute! Like all other thigh highs I've purchased, they are not for short girls. I'm 5'2"" and they come to the very top of my thighs - which still technically makes them thigh highs, I know. Just a little longer than I'd like, but other than that, no complaints."
3,too tight around the thigh,"if you are a size 12 in womens, and you have bigger thighs, not huge, but sexxy thighs with a bit of meat on them, I would recommend that you buy for plus size because I am 5 foot nine, 170 pounds and they look tight around my thigh"
2,Very small for the size listed,For the money spent on these I didn't find them worth it. Didn't even wear them for what I ordered them for. :( I ordered the plus size just to be on the safe side and they are so tight my thighs buldge over the tops. NOT attractive!! I wear a 12/14 jeans and I think these would fit my gf much better and she wears a size 8!! So definatly not a good plus sized item. :( Was sadly dissappointed.
5,great book,"this book is a must read for coaches of all sports. Great quotations, great stories. I have learned a lot from it and compared other situations also."
3,Quantity over quality,"Rather than devoting the appropriate attention and analysis to a few key cases for a given concept, this treatise gives cursory analyses (usually one or two sentences) to a vast number of cases. The general format is as follows: a vague statement of the law, followed by numerous cases that add (often irrelevant) bells and whistles but do not really deepen the reader's understanding of the concept.I could see how this book would be useful to a practitioner who might use it as a reference point to begin research, but I don't recommend it for a student who needs to attain a deep understanding of admin law. For this, the E&E; is better."
1,Index is all wrong!!!,"This book is completely useless because the index and table of cases cites incorrect pages!!! Chevron v. NRDC is apparently cited in note 7 on page 95, but there is no note 7 on page 95!!! In fact, there is no mention of Chevron on the entire page!!! Pages 411-414 are supposed to be some sort of deep discussion on the case, but again, nothing about Chevron there!!! This has been a complete waste of money. If the index can be so screwed, I wonder if the analysis in the book is worth anything at all."
2,The Boy Who Owned The School,"This book is alright but I wouldn't strongly recommond this book to people who like action or funny booksa. Because this book is neither one. I don't like it that much but you may. It's about a boy named Jacob who does not want to be seen. And he has an F in English. To get his grade up, he has to work the fog machine in the school play. But he didn't want to do it. To find out out if he does it, you have to read the book."
3,"Kind of a shy, nerdy Black Flag","ripping thru two minute ditties. Arguably the archetype for pop post punk like Weezer. Milo is hung up, hates the jocks, gets ignored by the girls, has rich folks and doesnt want to be anything like them. He's got heart, thinks he's pretty cool, but no one really cares to understand. Every nerd in love with the popular girl should hear ""Hope"" so they know they aren't alone. Not quite as good as the ""ALL"" record, but might be worth re-visiting the inner dork and listen to this in case you've forgotten that youre still him."
5,One of the top 5 all-time best soCal punk albums,"I initially wasn't going to write a review on this album since it's legacy speaks for itself... but after seeing another review here where someone ignorantly slagged this album without backing up their diatribe with anything substantial, I just had to jump in and state the obvious... THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST AMERICAN PUNK ROCK RECORDS OF ALL TIME.The proof is in the pudding... listen for yourself! I mean... maybe if you grew up listening to Aztec Camera then of course you're probably gonna hate this, but I grew up listening to this album.Short, sweet, simple, and raw is how some of us like it."
2,Boring,"Ok - it's punk! Woo hoo. Boring, repetitive, uninspiring; it probably did mean something in the past. But the past is over for a reason - for heaven's sake when I was younger I thought that Aztec Camera were good and I've learnt from my error.This is an album for music snobs who like to lecture folks about what is 'real' punk, and like to ridicule those who aren't sheep like losers."
4,Forget its flaws. This album is too much fun to ignore.,"Fitting in; looking for girls; and wondering why they couldn't get any... that's what makes this record such a punk milestone. Sure Milo can be a bit whiney, but who cares! Part of this record's fun is the immature anger and frustration of being a teenager torn between fitting in and wanting to give everyone the finger."
5,Blah,This is definitely one of the best punk albums of all time. The album is filled with raw energy. Great songs like parents and i'm not a loser. BUY this if you don't already have it.
1,"Fortunately, I didn't pay for this book.","The book title and description are misleading. They imply that this ""book"", which is really an ad pamphlet for the author's software, will teach the reader even a little about ""technical analysis"" and ""intermarket analysis"". While these phrases are used liberally throughout this ad pamphlet, the author only says that the detailed analyses are performed in a software package that he wrote, the name of which he uses just as liberally but one I won't mention since the dishonest nature of this book's title and description give me an idea of what the author and his software must be like.While I'm glad I got this book for free on as a promotion by the publisher, I truly regret wasting the time to read it and wonder if I can seek compensation from the author for the time I wasted to read it. Unfortunately, there is no rating of negative stars allowed."
1,Trend Forecasting With Technical Analyis,"I think it's safe to say that there is absolutely no useful information in this book. The author should be ashamed of himself for selling it. At best it should be considered a thick brochure for his product and given away for free. It's not even worth the postage. Mr. Mendelson must think the public are idiots. This book is a dishonor to John Murphy who presents good information throughout his own books. I am stunned that Mr. Murphy is happy to have his name this book. John, what were you thinking?"
1,The trade secret is to buy the software!!!,"This book dealt very little on ideas and methodologies. It is a hard sell on the author's software. Don't expect to learn anything new nor on any trading ideas.Nevertheless, the book is an easy read and served as a confirmation on general and common knowledge. This book came free with other purchase. I would seriously discourage people to spend [...]. on this manual."
2,Agree! Disappointing,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I bought the book because I wanted to learn more about intermarket technical analysis, but I was totally disappointed. Instead of explaining clearly how intermarket analysis actually works, Mendelsohn just tells you how good his software is forcasting intermarket trends. Save your money and buy John Murphy's Intermarket Analysis instead, although it's a bit outdated. (Granted that his software is very good piece of forcasting tool, I still feel duped reading 120 pages of infomercial. I would have returned the book if I hadn't made any marks on it.)"
1,Worst peice of S ever written,"This should not be called a book..empty..empty..empty.. Shame on this ""author"" ...do not write anymore...shame on you..This book is absolutely EMPTY ..you Learn NOTHING ..ZERO"
4,Neural Networks,"If you are interested in learning more about neural networks, you will find Mr. Mendelsohn's book a worthwhile read. Along with John Murphy, you've got the two leaders in this fascinating approach to trading.If you are using Vantage Point software, the book is a ""must."""
5,Information Rich Treasure,I used an older edition of this book in my crystallography studies. It is fasinating to see the pictures. There is a complete section that was helpful on using the polarising microscope. It also has an identification guide which is useful although a modern database could also do this type of searching. A good book for a geology student.
3,Interesting but not my favorite book of the genre,"If you are a fan of books about British gangsters/tough guys, you pretty much have to read this book, as Shaw is one of the most famous (or infamous) of that genre. Personally, this was not my favorite book of the genre. I liked it, but Shaw spent a lot of his life in prison, so naturally a large portion of the book talks about his time there and after a while it just got a little boring for me. I liked McLean's ""The Guv'nor"" better."
4,PARSON CHAIRS,Product is well made and easy to assemble. Use caution when tightening the bolts attaching the legs to avoid detaching the bolt housing mounted in the seat of the chair.
2,What a pain in the ....,"As far as looks, good. Comfort, they feel like there stuffed with newspaper but the price is cheap. Unfortunately so is the care. Chairs had many missing pieces for the leg/floor support and 2 of the 4 had ink marks, inch in length on one! Are you kidding me? Is anyone in charge over there? Believe in quality control? [...]"
4,Great chairs,These are great for the price. My dining chairs needed replacing and I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars. These are pretty comfortable and look great with almost any wood table. And they were not too expensive. They are microfiber though so sometimes I have to spot clean but it ususally comes out easily.
