5,Byron Will Be Byron,"Literary biography is rarely so amusing as Elledge's treatment of Byron's adolescence. But then, Byron will be Byron, and Elledge knows that better than anyone. A leading expert on English Romanticism's bad boy, Elledge expresses both the rigor of a scholar and the histrionics of his subject that defined the ethos of an age."
2,not worth it,"Pro: cheap, uses SD card, AAA battery, good battery door (the door is not an electrode), button control not a joystick (I can never remember where things are under the stick, old age!), has a hold button.Here are the unforgivable cons (in my opinion): only plays continuously in serial or with one repeat A-B without remembering where it left off, not even shuffle, EQ mode is horrible the only mode that is bearable is mp3 (this is on an excellent aiwa headphone), displays track number and time left of that track - not even the track name, the button controls are good but they are on the opposite side of the SD card slot hence pressure on the buttons and counter pressure on the card when you push...This one is not as good as another cheap simple player by JWIN which has all practical functions and sounds good except for the joy stick and battery door seems to want to burst at anytime...So still I am looking for a perfectly simple digital player..."
3,Simple MP3 player,"This is a very simple MP3 player. User interface is not great, but usable. I like it because it uses standard AAA batteries and I bought it for someone who is not too computer savvy and may not know how to plug something into the USB device for recharging (like most MP3 players do these days)"
1,Sucky product,"This product did not serve me well from the moment I got it. It was a handicap to me that I needed a memory card to operate the mp3 player. Also, there is no shuffle option so I had to listen to all of my music in the exact same order everytime. Additionally, the whole mp3 player would freeze up if I tried to switch songs too fast, and I would have to remove the battery and put it back in before the product would resume working. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,"Ok, you'll love it, but...","I think it's one of the most moving-feets songs the boys have done for a while, but I also think they should be already looking for a more complex side of dance music, and it's just a too easy option for a single... why don't you try with, for instance, For Your Own Good? That's a REAL great song, and remixes could be really cool. In brief, a fab dance song, but nothing they've never done before..."
5,olsen times!,"through the years mary kate and ashley olsen recorded lots of wonderfull songs, since their first sound track :""brother for sale"", they've recorded more then 4 c.d's! and shooted more than 20 musical videos! this c.d is a collection of all of their songs from their musical movies, c.d's and more ! i've really enjoyed that c.d and i think that you will too!"
1,TOO CUTSEY POO,"Nobody will deny that Mary-Kate and Ashley are very talented girls. They are now at an age where stinky junk like ""Nobody Tells the President What to Do"" and ""I am the Cute One"" are way too babyish. These songs do have some value -- they are family friendly and hopefully make girls feel better about themselves and more confident in their abilities. The songs do seem rather juvenile for these now mature young girls."
4,It is pretty,This book does have a lot of beautiful pictures. But most of them you have probably already seen before or can find scanned on the internet. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because there was a little to much white space on some of the pages and I did not like the pictures that span over 2 pages since this is a paper bound. Then paper it was printed on is good quallity and you will probably fiind the cheapest copy from amazon. If your a big fan of Cardcaptor Sukura then buy this book. (there are a few pictures with other characters to but the focuse is on Sukura)
3,"Lots of pictures, but not worth the money.","This is a large book, with many, many pictures of shelties,quite a few of them in color. However, there is not much elseof practical use to the casual Sheltie owner."
4,Obscure but entertaining,"I happened to pick this book up at the library quite randomly and I was pleasantly surprised. The narrator is a clever, curious, observant Scottish girl, about 9 years old, who describes life on her family's WWI-era farm in odd but poetic language that I found fresh and amusing. The main plot centers around the Miss Boyds, six ""old maids"" who settle into the nearby village and create havoc with their loud, indiscreet ways. It's not really a book for children--it's not a Scottish ""Little House on the Prairie."" The plot takes a few twists that, while not extremely graphic, are a bit more young adult. This is the first in a fairly extensive series of ""My Friends"" books, and I think it is well worth searching out if you are interested in something a little offbeat."
5,"The ""My Friends"" series by Jane Duncan","For sheer literate good writing, you can't beat the ""My Friends"" series by Jane Duncan. Not only does she have an excellent ear for dialect and dialogue, and skill at strong characterizations, she excels at plot. Even though the plots are often small in scale, the books have great texture and complexity. These are not children's books, nor are they ""nice"" books about a cozy time long ago, although those elements are present. You will find independent women here well before the feminist era, and loving but complex ""families, seriously troubled people who meet sad or tragic ends, all overlaid with themes that resonate very much with today's issues, despite copywright dates that are 55 to 35 years old. The series takes the female protagonist from childhood to middle-aged widowhood with wisdom, humor, and just plain good storytelling. Thank heaven there are so many in the series to enjoy!"
5,Just might be my favorite series ever,"I, too, randomly encountered this series at the library - the colorful illustrations on the dust jackets and the ""My Friends"" also had me wondering if this was a children's series. Far from it. I randomly started with ""My Friends the Mrs. Millers"" and was hooked; then I went back to the beginning and read the rest in order as much as I could. This book is first in the series chronologically and tells the story of the narrator's early childhood growing up on a remote Scottish croft. Interesting and compelling characters, a fascinating snapshot of life at that time in that place, and just damn good stories, all 18 or so of them. It's a shame that Duncan has fallen into obscurity--these books deserve much better!"
5,A thorough analysis of QoS and Traffic Engineering,Jerry Ash is a well known expert in the field and managed to provide a thorough and comprehensive analysis on QoS and Traffic Engineering. The reader will undoubtedly find in this book a large amount of valuable information illustrated by case studies. A recommended reading for anyone interested in QoS & Traffic Engineering.
3,Soda chargers cartidges,"must have if you have a home bar. Its for your Seltzer bottle,easy to make soda water from .I love it. Helps make a great Tom Collens."
3,Expected more,"The video actually felt really short. It's not too engaging is my guess on why some people cannot watch it in one sitting. I would have like it if they went a little more in-depth with the cars with some key people responsible for them. Even the feature cars were merely just touched upon. With that said, the video quality was excellent and the narrattion by Mike Shepherd was easy to listen to."

4,Pretty Good Compilation,"If you're an Ohio Players fan like I am, you'll probably enjoy this CD. My favorite song is ""Let's Do It (Interpolated with ""Let's Love""). Next to Earth, Wind & Fire, these guys are my second favorite band of all time."
1,Sominex by the pages,Mr. Antin has spouted his views on how advertising should be and at the same time single handedly created copydrones to carry on his boring dictums. Thank God for Luke Sullivan and many other creatives that follow their own drummer and keep this business alive and vibrant. I think this book should have a pillow top cover so when you fall asleep reading it you at least have somewhere to rest your head.
2,He's living in the 1950s,"The ads he advocates (he gives numerous examples in these pages) were bland 25 years ago. TIme has moved on...but Mr. Antin has not. If the idea of advertising is to capture your audience attention, why do what has already been done? What you can see on any UHF station anytime? Mr. Antin apparently doesn't like to be challenged, because there's nothing here a bright twelve year old could not come up with."
2,Absolut Waste,"If everyone did what Mr. Antin believes in, advertising would be dull. Duller than it already often is, even. He seems to think that Readers Digest headlines and banal wordplay are the sin qua non of advertising creativity. It's sad that he lectures to members of the business community, and that they apparently take what he says seriously. It explains why so many clients are reactive, imitative, and why their advertising blends together and is quickly forgotton. And why when a company or industry breaks the ""rules"" they create memorable work (Nike, Got Milk, Porsche, Isuzu). 256 pages of waste."
4,Customer-centric Advertising Sells,"I read Tony Antin's book. As a print advertising copywriter, I found it very useful because it supports the idea that ""customer-centric"" advertising is the way to go. Antin doesn't say you can't be creative or memorable. Just the opposite, in fact -- as long as you quickly and clearly communicate the most compelling reasons why the target audience would want your product. I highly recommend the book."
3,Not what is shown,The product received was not what is shown in the picture or in the description it is an earlier version by Lucent Technologies. Though it is usable it takes aditional effort to add them into an existing Avaya phone system.
3,"Enjoyable, similar to other Irish groups","I liked the cd, but it is average compared to others I have. I recommend it if you don't have other groups, but first I'd compare them by listening samples on Amazon."
2,Okay speed but loud!,"I've had this PC for about three weeks and so far its been good and bad.The good part is it is much faster than my old K6 but much slower than my brother's Gateway 2GHz P4. He had it over the other day for some head to head gaming and his screamed at higher settings. Mine cost less though!!! And so far all but the newest games run great. I did notice the new Castle Wolfenstein was a little choppy, but I have so many older games I have been ithcing to play I don't mind. For [more money] I can buy a new video card and play anything I want.The other thing is the noise! This thing is loud! I could hardly hear my brother's P4 but my fan on my Compaq is a persistent loud hum. I have taken to turning on music in the background to drown it out. I called Compaq to see if I needed a new fan and the guy told me it was normal. Funny they didn't mention it in the add!"
2,Display/Network Woes Presario 6010us,"Picked it up about a year ago, and it worked ok. However, when upgraded memory with PNY pc2100 512mb x 2 dimms, the computer has random lockups, video degradation and just generally unstable performance. Freezes playing dvd - and before that has a lot of random horizontal lines going all over the screen, spontaneously reboots while downloading from the internet via the network connection.Memory has been tested and is known good. Motherboard and hard drive were replaced at an authorized facility and still the same results. I think it's the MSI's realization of NForce chipset, and I may be SOL. Definitely annoying and unworkable.Support is difficult to get and wastes a lot of your time before getting you permission to ship to a repair facility. So, stay away :)"
2,So-so,"I bought this to replace an old Dell which was beyond it's time. The price was right but the quality isn't the greatest. The power supply died the first week I had it. Not a big deal but I could have done without the hassle. Next time I think I will either go with Dell, Gateway or maybe HP. If you are looking for a bargian and don't mind technical problems then this is probably a good deal for you."
2,Thomsas Cleary is a bad translater,"Zen Antics contains Zen stories without any profundity. It was a simple translation that does a diservice to people who love beautiful stories. It does not express the simplicity, irony, and beauty of Zen. I would not recommend buying this book."
4,NOT awful,"I hate to do this but ""a musician"" is very incorrect. If you read the first line of the information the publisher says this book is designed for ""classroom use"". I used this text in college and now use it to teach my Advanced Placement Music Theory Course. Without a teacher (or the teachers edition) the book is essentially a lot of music examples with the first note(s) written in. The point of the book is to develop the ear. It is clearly not a self study book. (Of course, if one bothered to read the information on site one would know that)."
2,without CD,I received the book for ear training technique for listening and I have not received the CD of the book. Please can check and send the CD to my address. thanks
3,Yes to music.,"I was right about this book. I found something I ordered. Thank you, this is the first step I took to learning ear training."
5,"""flowing, soothing and meditating ~ I Muvrini""","Their polyphonic harmonies take the Corsican vocal form and make it into an art form ~ unique is the sound of I Muvrini with a latest release ""Pulifunie"", offer powerful moments within a realm of nine voices. Performed a cappella sharing a soulful haunting harmonic voice of freedom. We hear exceptional voices of Alain and Jean-Francois Bernardini spreading love and respect for you the listener and fans ~ deeply attached to their roots brings the revival of Corsican music.So enjoy the entire album, slow-moving voices drift over melodies like a breeze over clouds in the sky ~ you feel every note and phrasing. Wonderful second album from Higher Octave ~ this will be in my collection now and years to come.Total Time: 39:47 on 11 Tracks ~ Higher Octave 82621 ~ (4/22/2003)"
5,spot oiler,used to lubricate model train engines and parts. very handy and easy to direct oil to a specific spot. more than satisfied with this product
3,pretty good disc,this cd has some good songs on it.such as love makes things happen.a great duet with BabyFace.giving you the benefit is tight.most of the production was done by LA&Babyface.the slow songs work alright.some of the material hasn't aged that well but overall it's still a pretty good disc.
4,Well done!,"I was finally able to get a copy of ""Always"" from a used bookstore. I remember seeing the videos for ""Giving You The Benefit"" and ""Love Makes Things Happen"" almost 10 years ago. I was not disappointed with this album. ""Giving You The Benefit"" is still the jam and ""Love Makes Things Happen"" is still a great ballad. Some of my personal favorites include ""Always,"" ""Why Do I Believe"" and the extended mix of ""Giving You The Benefit."" I like ""Backyard"" but it sounds different from the maxi-single that I have. The album version is only OK. ""Give It To Me"" is the weakest track, in my opinion. The other songs are OK too. Anywayz, if you're a Pebbles fan then you won't be disappointed. It's a really good album. Trust me."
3,Some Good Songs In Here....,"What I like about Pebbles even more than her singing was that she knew how to promote herself, and when to get out of the game on top. She always looked nice and classy, like a true lady. I can't get enough of ""Love Makes Things Happen."" She looks very beautiful in the album's booklet."
5,"""NOT JUST ANOTHER CUTE SINGER,THIS GIRL CAN REALLY BLOW !","PEBBLES,ALWAYS IS A COMPLETE PACKAGE OF DANCEABLE GROOVES WITH SOME FUNKY BASS LINES AND SLOW LOVE BALLADS ABOUT REAL LOVE AT IT'S BEST ! I GUESS THAT'S WHY IT WENT PLATINUM,BECAUSE OF THE TALENT AND SPUNK THIS BEAUTIFUL LADY BRINGS TO THE FOREFRONT OF RHYTHM AND BLUES !"
4,Always? Only if you were there,"""Always"" is one of those ""time capsule"" albums that simply reminds one of the music of the 80's. Yes, while tolerable to the ear, the recording is dated and can only, for the most part, be appreciated by those of us fortunate to have been around at the time...and remember her.Pay attention, Ashanti!"
2,Hard to learn,This is very complex software for a beginner even though it is advertised as very easy to learn. I later bought the training CD for $50 and it teaches none of the basics needed to use the software. The training does tell about the differences between older versions and version 16. The support on their website does not work nor have they replied to any of my correspondence asking for assistance. I have worked for days to get very limited results and will probably remove the software from my computer and chalk it up as a $100+ experience.
3,"Pretty color, not very usefull","The little lip on the lower edge does not do a very good job keeping recipe books open, and forget about trying to use this with a thicker book like Joy of Cooking. The little magnets are cheaply made and two of them fell apart almost immediately. Too bad, it's really cute and I love the orange color."
2,Is someone padding the reviews?,"If you look through the 10 reviews (at the time I am writing this) you will notice that three of them were authored by ""A Reader from The Hamptons"". The reviews read like they were written by the same person and it makes you wonder if Mr. Crayton (or his mom) lives in the Hamptons!I do own a copy of the previous version of this book, which was entitled ""A+ Adaptive Exams"". That book was very brief when it came to tutorial material, but the book was praised by reviewers as having practice questions that were a lot closer to the ones from the real exams than appear in most books brought to market.I haven't followed through on taking the exam yet, so I can't verify that personally.In any case, the phony reviews make me a little hesitant about the book at this time. The book may be an excellent resource, but the phony reviews have slowed down this ""Reader from NYC"" in purchasing one particular ""Certification Book From The Hamptons""."
2,Haste makes waste,"I purchased this book because, at the time, it was the only one I could find covering the recent CompTIA A+ test revisions. Sadly, the editors seemed in such a rush to get this out to print that they missed several detrimental mistakes and typos in the book AND on the CD. I find this to be inexcusable, ESPECIALLY since it has been out for several months and no errata has been presented by the publisher. Choose this book at your own risk!!"
3,"Average, but not great","I used this text as my sole study source for the CompTIA 2003 A+ exams and passed both on my first try. That's the good news. The bad news is that after taking the tests, I didn't feel that this text adequately prepared me for these exams. I was asked several questions on items that were not even covered in the text (IPv6 and Subnet masking for starters). There is also at least 2 questions in the chapter review questions that list the wrong answer. I also discovered at least one wrong answer on the practice exams. Overall, I would say that this is an average study guide but I can not give it a strong endorsement."
3,Good but not enough,"I just took and barely passed my A+ Hardware exam. This was one of the 2 books I read in preparation [the other was the A+ ExamCram2 Practice Questions and it had similar shortcomings]. Maybe it's true that no single book can be comprehensive. I found this book to be informative but not closely reflective of the test itself. This book will help you pass but that's it. I agree with a previous reviewer - if you want to score really high, you'll need some hands-on experience.I just passed the OS exam on August 14th. In this case, I think the book was closer to the test. However, I passed with a low grade so I stand by my original opinion."
3,Useful but not perfect,"It's been a very helpful guide, which reminded me of a lot of things I should know as an Info Tech Professional, like stopping and restarting the Print Spooler as a possible first step to resolving printer issues, and I did learn a thing or two. I did however find some mistakes in it, like page 237 where it talks about NIC adaptors having 10 digits - Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are 12 digits hexadecimal, not 10. That's probably just a typo, but it's a pretty major item for a test. Christopher is really good about giving the reader web sites that cover various topics more in depth."
4,"The A+ Exams Guide: (Exam 220-301), (Exam 220-302)","...The other reviewers for this book are accurate however, I have an issue with the errors and typos IN THIS BOOK!!!I bought this book to correctly answer the exam. Lucky for me I realize some of the errors, but I EXPECT Charles River Pub or the author to create a webreference to CORRECTIONS where the editor & fact checker FAILED. Publisher/Author take note: we're talking 2004 and expect 100% accuracy when paying $45 for a reference.Thanks, enjoy. (buy it used, buy several titles.)"
5,I passed!,My friend used the book A+ Adaptive Exams and passed both A+ tests before they changed the exam. He told me to get this one. I did and I passed both of the new comptia A+ tests. I am A+ Certified and I am freaking happy. The book was really easy to understand and prepared me well for the test. The test was a breeze.
2,Only if......,"This book may have scraped up 3 stars, if it weren't for the lack of pictures to help. Every page it seems there is a caption ""to learn more about this goto...."" and then a webaddress. I strongly would recommend the Mike Meyers A+ book. I passed using this book only as a quick refresher, but found it was missing way too much. I did pass my exam, but no real thanks goto this book."
5,what are you waiting for ???,"picks up where moon safari left us, perfect for the wind down after a heavy day. Aloud will make you relax and remember what summer evenings are for, enjoy."
3,Better for getting the creative juices flowing than anything else.,"I will just say briefly: while this book does clearly diagram where the lighting should be for each shot, many of the shots involve set ups the average photographer won't be using, such as a pool, or directly overhead large lighting. I would have gotten more out of it if he had done more shots with a simple set-up, showing you how to get by without owning a bunch of different lights. It's an interesting book that may get the creative juices flowing, but if you are looking for a comprehensive guide for easy set-ups with one light, this might not be what you want. There are many examples, however, of natural lighting set-ups. But you may not have the luxury of three windows on differing sides or a nice leather couch to take the photos on."
2,Since when does nude imply female?,"This book should be titled ""Lighting Nude Photography of Young Women."" While it's very helpful, there is little to no consideration of other body types or the lighting of men. While many of the techniques are similar, it's still a poorly titled work."
2,"Looks good, but burns in!","I bought this monitor as a replacement for my HP that I was very happy with, but broke accidentally during a recent move. I should have opened my wallet a bit wider and replaced it with the sale monitor, because my Westinghouse (though it looks good) burned in at the top of the screen after a mere 2 months of normal use. The Internet Explorer toolbar has etched itself into the top of the screen! I've tried every trick I could find to get rid of this image ""memory"" but to no avail. If you think LCD monitors can't burn in, think again."
4,Sheen Shines,"I hadn't seen Bishop Sheen for many many years...not since he broadcasted on TV. He made an impact on me then and as I watched Angels, as an older and wiser person, I realized that this man was amazing and ahead of his time.This particular video is classic Sheen and he imparts his information amid gentle wit and wisdom. Even if you aren't Catholic, I think you'll like this DVD. If you grew up with Bishop Sheen in your background, the nostalgia factor is 5 star."
5,Angels,Bishop Sheen Message is as relevent today as when it was firstshown on TV. It is full of wit and wisdom.
3,"No, too much missing to call their best","A fine album, as far as it goes. But it is missing too much oftheir better, and earlier work. No ""Who's Gonna Take TheWeight"", ""Funky Stuff"", ""Let The Music Take Your Mind"". Sure, the work here is fine, but to call this collection their ""BEST"", would be a gross understatement. Instead, go for ""The Best of Kool & The Gang 1969-1976. More and better cuts."
3,Little but nice,"Product is tiny, much smaller than I expected. This was an impulse buy and had I researched a little more on the net I could have found this medal for half the price. But it is what it is, and it is small, but well made and nice looking, just order a magnifying glass at the same time."
4,"Mild, Wonderful Blue Veined Cheese","'Saint Agur originates from the mountainous Auvergne region of central France, an area renowned for a centuries old tradition of blue cheese making. A rich blue taste with a smooth, creamy texture, Saint Agur is ideal for snacking, cooking and the cheeseboard.'"
5,Saint Agur's 4th Miracle,"I tasted this in a local wine and cheese shop, and it quickly became a favorite of my husband's and mine. Rich, tangy, salty, oh so creamy, this is a frequent visitor on our cheese board. We serve it with Australian wafer-thin crackers..........when we have guests. When no one is watching, I sneak nibble after nibble just on its own. Dolloped on a perfectly grilled rare ribeye, it melts beautifully into an ambrosial accompaniment."
2,blue cream cheese,"I had a sample of this cheese today, it is very creamy, maybe to much for my taste, I prefer an harsh bite like Danish blue or Stilton, with a low cream content preferably."
5,Very amusing look at FAT cats,"As the proud owner of two fat cats, I enjoyed this book. I thought my 20-lb cats were fat until I saw some of the critters featured here. If you are a cat person, you'll like this collection of incredibly fat and funny felines."
5,A girl's good book,We thoroughly enjoy this book and the whole series. It was hard to put down and yet my daughter was really able to understand the story and relate to the characters.
3,Old-fashioned but good,"I enjoyed this book, as I have all of the books in the Elsie Dinsmore series. However, it is written in an old-fashioned, somewhat syrupy style. I also found the anti-Catholic bias of the book somewhat disturbing."
3,Not up to her usual standard.........,"Unless one has read Ms. Paretsky's previous novels in this series, one would come away from this book with the sense that Lotty is a raving nutcase who is very hard to care about, despite the interspersed chapters about her early life. I also found it difficult to get interested in all the insurance brouhaha, which at times was confusing. Ms. Paretsky writes well, and V.I. is great, but I felt that this time around the story was just not all that riveting."
2,Washawski confusion,"I've looked forward to hearing more about Lotty Herschel. She is an enigma with a past, but is more loving and giving than any that Vic has met since the death of her mother. The close bond between Lotty and Vic has been a special thread through all of her books. So, when the ""story of Lotty"" was coming out, I was all eager to read the secret history.I now have slogged through over half the book, primarily because of the promise of the idea it dangled in front of me. However, many places do not make any sense and VI is constantly banging into one person, then careening to another ""pin ball game"" is how the character refers to it. Lotty just shut up for this first half of the book. No loving kindness, just hautiness. It must be her evil twin. And the black subplot goes around and around, sort of like the drain in ""Psycho"". I am very disappointed with the book."
3,"Too much book, too little reward","I've read all of Paretsky's books so far, and I will read more--because she's a good writer, and I'm not giving up after one grindingly boring experience. Yes, there were good moments in this book, and a glimmering of history which redeems it. But in a world saturated with holocaust stories, Paretsky's use of this background and character motivation was neither exceptional nor believable. And in a genre which depends on strong characters, suspense, and careful plotting, the obsession with the WW II background causes the novel to trip and stumble, and the reader to yawn and wish the book would come to an end."
3,Where Is the Mystery?,"I found this latest entry in the V.I. Warshawski series oddly compelling. I really shouldn't have liked this book. This series has never really made it onto my must-read list -- maybe its V.I.'s character? Even the Chicago milieu isn't very interesting.In Total Recal, the ""myster(ies)"" werent't very mysterious (there were several in this convoluted plot) and the solutions relied on a variety of coincidences. The plot was quite unbelievable. What kept me reading was the Lotty subtext. Again, there was no real mystery (A woman takes a leave of absense due to ""illness"" and disappears, never to speak to her lover again? -- hmmm, I wonder what that means?).What kept me reading was to see 1) if I was right about what was going on -- I was; and 2) Lotty's story."
1,Torture,"I have been attempting to read this book for two months. I refused to put it away without finishing it. But, the thought of reading it was torture. It is soooo slow paced and drawn out. I feel like the real story could have been told in half the time. Did I really need to hear about how she juggles her time in the car between time on the cell phone. How about her time at a diner while on the cell phone. I mean really? Why should my time be wasted on this?"
1,Sara... you blew it with this one!,Let me start by saying I LOVE the VI Warshawski series! This is the 11th in the series and I'm reading them all in order. I've really enjoyed the first ten but I am struggling to even finish this one! I sure hope the rest are better! Please don't make this be your first VI Warshawski or it will probably be your last!
2,"""Total Recall"" is truly forgettable","In Sara Paretsky's 2001 V.I. Warshawski novel, the private investigator's boyfriend tells her that she bounces all over Chicago like a deranged ping pong ball.Listen up Sara. You're trying to tell yourself something.In ""Total Recall"" Warshawski spends far too much time in the car. In fact, she seems always to be in the car. And it's not that interesting a drive.When not scooping the Loop, Paretsky takes the reader down a tortured and twisted Nazi Germany survivor side plot that isn't very diverting and comes into 21st Century America in a very confusing fashion. But through it we learn more about V.I's physician friend Lottie.Still, learning about Lottie at this late date is too high a price to pay when she becomes the only character in the decades-old series with any depth.And if Sara Paretsky continues to introduce parallel plots, she'd do well to make sure that she gives V.I. as much of a life as she gives history a voice."
3,Not Paretsky's best,"Sara Paretsky is one of my favorite authors and with Hard Time she's surpassed herself. I was disappointed with Total Recall even if it does shed some light on Lotty and I now understand the her much better than I did before. She was a lovable character but I did wonder about the reasons for her extreme aloofness. Now I understand and I like her even more. However, even if some of the power is clearly there (Lotty and her story), some is missing (the Swiss people are not very much alive, and the therapist remains a mystery).However, it's a wonderful book nonetheless. I love Sara P. and Vic."
1,Disappointing,"This story was by no means a mystery . How V.I. keeps being a friend to Lotty IS a mystery . Now that her past has been revealed , maybe she can stop being so nasty to everyone .I had looked forward to this book ; am glad I got it at the library and didn't waste the money ."
2,Not up to her usual standards!,This book was very disappointing. Many of the characters are 2 dimensional (especially Radbuka and his ridiculously overdrawn therapist) and much of the dialogue is unrealistic. The coincidences employed to bring the plot together really stretch the limits of credibility. I read it to the end but put it down feeling I would hesitate before buying the next VI.
2,strange storyline,"Paretsky seems to have dropped interesting characters in favor of a convulted, unbelievable storyline. Having V.I.'s boyfriend on his way to report on the dangerous Taliban turns out to be the most believable part of the book."
5,Paretsky's Best Book to date!,"I have always enjoyed her books, but this was the most profoundly great story she has written yet. I couldn't put it down."
3,disappointing,"Generally I find sara paresky's V.I. Warheski novels very enjoyable. Unfortunately the novelist makes Lotty Hershel to much of a victim. I guess I liked the strong,dedicated character to the self pitying character I found in this book. Although I realize the author tries to let us know her past, I do not enjoy his foray into WWII meladrama. Also everybody is wrong but the little guy. Really Sara your only missing your attacks on the roman catholic church and the people who work in Chicago's steelworks. Hope you can back your writing about strong women in modern chicago."
1,Mixed at best,"I agree with those who didn't much like this book. Paretsky tries to bring together three threads -- a murder mystery around an insurance scam; a mystery as to whether a man who has been subjected to ""recovered memory"" therapy is who he thinks he is, and the story of a victim of the holocaust. The connections are at best coincidental, and the first teo stories are unconvincing and frequently dull. I did, however, really enjoy the third story (which makes up about 20% of the book) and found it very touching.One other thing. I didn't read the book but listened to the audio tape. The narrator did a superb job, and I think made the hearing richer than reading would have been."
1,"If you like REAL mysteries, move on...","500 pages of boring dribble. Typical political nonsense: rich people are evil, corporations are evil, the judicial system is evil, and all poor people and prisoners are simply victims of all above. The plot and action are all too unrealistic. I am a mystery reader, I like to be taken through unexpected journies. I like suprising twists and turns. I like characters who seem to be so unreal, but so close to people you really know. Nothing suprising in this book at all. And the book just fizzles at the end when the killer and motive are revealed. Even more unvbelievable is how VI gets ""even"" with at least some of thos evil entities listed above. If you like to read about the plight of the poor and how evil the world is, be my guest and get this book, everyone needs to make a buck, even Sara. If you like real mysteries, skip this one!"
1,A muddled read,"I plowed through this latest VI Warshawski book. It was hard concentrating on the story itself when I kept trying to figure out how Paretsky tied all the threads together in the first place. Lotty is brusque as usual, but this time she is also just plain miserable. Carl is miserable, Don is miserable, Calia is miserable - in fact everyone in this latest disaster is miserable. The only goodness comes from VI and Morrell, but it's not a ""good"" goodness. VI has changed. No more fighting, fuming, or chasing. The down-on-her-luck, tough as hell VI seems to have disappeared and has been replaced with this gentle soul who has found true love. BLAH! Couple this with the fact that we're treated to Paretsky's (and I guess VI's) political views on the Holocaust, slave reparations, and even the Taliban. I liked VI so much more before I found out she was a liberal!"
1,"If I am not me, den who da hell am I?","If I could give this book no stars, I would. There is no Arnold, no Mars and no three-breasted alien women in this book and is totally undeserving of the name Total Recall. Avoid at all costs."
2,Another Fine Statue from McFarlane,"Like almost every other action figure issued by the McFarlane Toy company, this is an excellent-looking specimen.And like every other ""action figure"" issued by the McFarlane Toy company, there is no ""action"" to the figure at all. It's a statue. Let's just start calling it what it is. It's only good for a single pose on its partial diorama and has no articulation at all.For all their skill at sculpting - which is considerable - the engineers employed by McFarlane should explore how to marry that talent with the option of creating a figure that can actually be POSED."
5,Wish I'd Read This Book Sooner!,"I purchased this book a couple months after becoming part of a team of women who are developing a women's ministry at our church. The first few chapters alone would have saved us a ton of work, had I read this book earlier. Not to despair, however, this book is packed full of practical advice and encouragement, touching on every conceivable aspect of developing a women's ministry from the ground up. The author's style is friendly and easy to read, yet the book is organized in such a manner that it can be easily accessed as an reference. We purchased books for every member of our women's ministry team and all have found it to be excellent. Highly recommend."
5,A Must Have,This book is amazing. I recently took over our WM and this book has been a lifesaver. It's full of great ideas for events and retreats. This book was more helpful than the one I bought entitled Women's Retreats. Also great suggestions for creating your team. This is a must have.
4,Visitations.,"Who do I hear here? Michael Hedges (obviously), Leo Kottke, Pat Metheny, and John Fahey. I don't really hear Kaki King, but I believe that her ""voice"" will come forward at a later time.At this time, this CD reminds me of some other very talented quitarists... and that's not a bad thing.The hatred evidence by some of the reviews is unwarranted, and sounds like the jealous complaints of people who have lost out in a musical competition.A nice listen holding promise for the future. Worth the price."
5,Dangerously Flawless,"You would never expect the sounds coming from this unsuspecting young woman. It would be perfect mellow background music if it weren't for the fact that her playing commands your rapt attention. Highly recommended for guitar or instrumental lovers, or any amatuer accoustic guitarist who wants to be shamed into never picking up the instrument again."
4,kaki king for president,i saw kaki king pretty recently and it was definitely some of the greatest musicianship ive seen in a long time if not ever. im not really sure if she played the songs on this cd but im sure its still worth checking out.not only is she a good mucisian she also seemed like a really nice person so if you get a chance to see her dont turn it down.
4,What an amazing guitarist!,"If you love unique sounds and intricate acoustic arrangements - - this CD is for you! Kaki King is amazing and her music is nothing short of amazing itself. The style is like none other - a mix of blues/jazz/folk/classical and is a delight to the ear. If you are a fan of Tim Reynolds, then you will absolutely love Kaki King as well."
2,"It's OK, but give me a break","Obviously no one in these reviews has ever heard of Preston Reed. Kaki sure has as most of her music is a straight ""lift"". I do like her song Carmine Street as that sounds original. Please listen to the true master of tapping and the ""over the top"" technique , Prston Reed, before you crown her queen."
5,A must have.....,"I just saw Kaki King at the Bonnaroo festival in TN the weekend of the 13th. I had never actually heard any of her songs before the show and went on only having read about her music. I must say that I was completly blown away right from the start. ... her technique isn't exactly groundbreaking, but she does it so well, with so much dicipline ... that it is nothing short of amazing. The first person I thought about was Michael Hedges upon hearing her play. I can't wait to see the direction she goes in the future...especially since she is only 23!!"
5,"The guitar, not just a melodic instrument","I definately disagree with one of the reviews made. The guitar is a percussive instrument. The art of abstraction through guitar can be seen in kaki's playing. Although not perfect, it almost seems as if she will only continue to grow as a musician, her tracks vary considerable on attack and complexity. I'd expect more on her up and coming albums. Nobody has ever said experimentation will lead you to the perfect solution every time. In Kaki's playing, her experimentation on various levels is merely her way of pushing the envelope on music showing guitar in both light-hearted and rocky compositions. Don't lump this girl in any category as a wannabe, you might as well say everyone whose ever tapped on guitar is a van halen wannabe and evereyone who plays a power chord is a nirvana wannabe. Believe me, an appreciation forthe auv on gaurve (spelling?) genre never hurt anyone. Its art, not politics. Listen to reed and hedges carefully, they vary considerably."
1,a lump of coal in my Christmas sock,"Reecived this as a gift on Christmas. Never heard of Kaki King before.Can't make any sense at all out of this sound (can't even bring myself to call it ""music""). It's just a lot of aimless, unfocused, and shapeless sound. Sometimes she gets a rhythm going, but then she loses it, and the entire piece falls apart. This happens in several tracks.There is not a single melody anywhere on this CD. How can anyone record an entire CD with a complete absence of melody? What is the point of that?It's like writing a novel with a lot of loose words and phrases, but nary a complete sentence. Just lots of words, but no story, no characters, no plot. It's pointless.This CD is pointless.There are so many truly fantastic acoustic guitarists out there. This poor girl is no match for any of them. I much prefer Muriel Anderson to Kaki King.This is a very weak effort. This music should never have been released. What a shame."
5,Refreshingly original!,"I just finished reading this novel and I loved it. I have read many Holocaust novels, and so many of them sound the same. Lynne Kositsky has been able to take the genre one step beyond. Her characters are real and complex, and the story is one that hasn't been told before. I like how she shows the bad in good people, and the good in the bad.I have read many of Kositsky's novels, but this one is her best.Bravo!"
5,GreYt bed!!,This product is wonderful! We have a 75 lb greyhound and he looks small in the bed! We actually get to sit on the couch now that he has a nice big comfy bed to sleep on!Thanks So Much!
1,don't buy this book,"This is the most over-priced book I have ever purchased. I expected to get a comprehensive, well-organized book. This 189-page book does not fit that description. It does contain a compilation of games, drills and tips, but often they don't list a purpose or objective. I was left wondering why or when I would want to do them. Also, much of the information is not new, gathered from such sources as Tennis Magazine and Tennis World.The book appears to have been hastily written. It looks more like a first draft than a finished book. It is filled with typographical, grammatical and punctuation errors that were very distracting to me."
4,some great ideas,"When coaching tennis you can get in a rut. This book is great for some new ideas to make practice fun. Even the games for little kids are adaptable for all ages.Most irritating, though, were the typos. I am at a loss as to how this made it to print! Example: ""Split the students uiD3 on each side...point will continue unt-:Il someone misses the ball..missed the ball rec@eves 1 letter..."" Very frustrating when you have to interpret the entire paragraph! Granted, another reviewer found out is was a software problem - but why publish it!Getting past those typos, though, those of us with growing frustration over lax grammer will still enjoy it. A great reference to keep handy when you need to spice up practice or lessons. We all need a little help now and then!"
5,The best book ever,"Tina Hoskins wrote the best book on tennis ever. I read the book which she donated for my school fundraiser ""Night Under the Stars."" It has so many things that help tennis players like me today. Tina is really nice and is my tennis teacher. She teaches the game very well and shows it in her book. She is the best tennis teacher and write ever.Larissa S."
1,Improper advertisement,"The patches I received are not as described. The patch was advertised as 4""x3"". The patches I received were 3""x2.5"". There is no problem with the quality of the patches, they would do well attached to a baseball cap or something small. They are just too small to be used as a shoulder patch on my uniforms."
4,Poorly Executed Xfer to the Kindle,"THESE ARE COMMENTS ON THE KINDLE EDITION.I love Flashman. When younger, I enjoyed Hornblower, but Flashman is more to my taste nowadays. Just the thing for an airplane trip or a summer at the beach.Now someone tell me why this edition does not have footnotes that work. Lots of other Kindle books handle footnotes. Click, select footnote, click, read footnote, click, return to text. Great. But couldn't the publisher get off his duff and do the job properly?Fraizer's footnotes about Flashy's historical setting are half the fun."
5,Vintage Flashman,"This may be one of the weaker entires in the Flashman Papers, but any Flashman is superior historical fiction. Anyway, in some ways it is right at the top, illuminating a forgotten historical event and making it come alive.Some grumpy conservatives have complained that in one or two places, G.M. Fraser lets his opposition to the war in Iraq show, but Flashman transcends politics and, while I am a firm supporter of the war, conservatives ought to lighten up. If leftists could champion the Flashman series despite the author's incorrect politics and support of imperialism, we conservatives ought to be able to overlook a single paragraph in the latest book. Anyway, King Theodore, whom Flashman and General Napier depose, is not even as bad as Saddam Hussein, and Fraser rightly praises that venture, so, like all Flashman novels - like all great literature in fact - you can take what you want from this book. Enjoying it all the way."
3,Flashman,"Another great yarn although Flashman is getting a little predictable. However it is a ""must have"" if you are a Flashman fan, like me."
4,Another rousing episode episode of the Flashman Papers,"What can I say except that Flashman delivers again. This story has all the characteristics which we have come to expect from the series - a distant and exotic locale, a mad emperor, Englishmen in distress and a gallant British army to the rescue and of course Flashman. A Flashman who has matured, who is wiser and more assured than his youthful self, but who at heart remains the same lecherous coward, bully and all round rogue.But what really make the Flashman series special is that the events described - the British Army's Expedition to Abyssinia to free a group of hostages from the clutches of the Mad Emperor Theodore -actually occurred and have been rigorously researched by the author. So read this tale and you will learn about a fascinating but largely forgotten event in Victorian history."
2,Going through the motions,"This was a disappointing entry in this series, as most of the earlier books have been quite entertaining. The author seemed to be going through the motions of writing his style of book, but he was basically cutting and pasting a scene here and a scene there from previous novels. You had Flashy with the lovely but dangerous women; Flashy in mortal peril; fearful Flashy abandoning others to save himself; Flashy looking bluff and manly but inwardly quaking; and Flashy's presence at crucial events being misinterpreted to his favor. It was all very rote and leads you to believe that the author is getting tired of it all. The historical wrapping was different from the other books, of course, but it came across as generically Foreign and Exotic; it seemed as if the author had run out of interesting adventures to slot into Flashy's timeline and so chose this one as a second-best option."
4,Foghat Rocks!,"This recording, consisting of songs from the bands most recent video release from 1997, rocks. All of the great Foghat songs are here, live, as well as some more recent material. A great value for the price."
4,Great for the price!,"The whole ""extended version"" series of cd's is a little dubious. You have to be careful as a lot of these discs are disguised previously released material! For the faithful, this is a good clean sounding recording from their live dvd. A welcome addition to your collection. For the casual fan, its a great party/picnic cd. The opening song / salute to their Savoy Brown roots (Louisiana Blues) is totally awsome! Nice fat guitar tones throughout! Its a nice historic audio document of the original boogie men! Long live Lonesome Dave & Rod Price!"
2,Great performances but poor sound quality,"Big disappointment. I've heard better sound on a telephone. I imagine the recording engineer was inexperienced, distracted, or lazy. The sound is very compressed, which removed most of the bass and drums. It's mostly loud guitar and vocals. The quieter songs have a better mix."
3,Problems with getting to the soundtrack music,"The music was fine once I found the non apparent means of access. When the disc is inserted, the flash preview program comes up and there is no apparent way to the soundtrack music. I was about to give up when I brought up explore, right clicked on the disc title and clicked on run. The Real Player came up and I was able to listen to the soundtrack. Not nice."
2,winged migration,"I can't make a rewiew of the the purchase, since i have not recieved the cd yet. Where is it?"
5,BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT,This was an AMAZING CD. I just received it in the mail and it is everything and more I thought it would be. I LOVE IT. BUY IT if you can. You won't regret it. The music is beautiful. Absolutely BEAUTIFUL.
4,Boot Camp For Mecha Soldiers,"Intended as a game-within-a-game, the Accelerated Training Program casts player characters as cadets in combat school, with a series of simulations, exercizes, player-against-player sparring, and other quick-run scenerios."
3,Unique music,"This CD contains three pieces of music, the primary one is a symphony composed for the three Lord of the Rings books. This album was composed before the movies by Peter Jackson, and so bear no resemblance their soundtracks. The music is classical in form, but modernist in genre. All the music on this disc is similiar to the compositions of other 20th century classical artists such as Philip Glass, Igor Stravinsky, and Charles Ives in the unusual melodies, lack of consistent emotion, and complex tunes. This music is absolutely different from the score used in the LOTR movies; which are evocative, dramatic and simple in tune. The compositions on this disc on the other hand, are almost impossible to hum due to their complexity. Overall, the disc is worth listening to. The music is interesting but not great."
4,An excellent recording of excellent music.,The performance is absolutely wonderful. Althought the interpretation (especially in the Gandalf movement) differs from other times I've heard this (namely the Air Force Band) I can't say it's any better or worse. Anyone who likes Lord of the Rings will also like van der Roost's Spartacus that follows.
5,VERY GOOD INTERPRETATION...............,"THIS A VERY GOOD INTERPRETATION FOR THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE MUSIC IS DESCRIPTIVE IN IT'S OWN WAY. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWNFEELING AS TO THE MUSIC OF MIDDLE EARTH AND THE LORD OF THE RINGSAND I FEEL THIS IS ANOTHER VERY GOOD VIEW OF MIDDLE EARTH. MY FAVORITE IS DAVID ARKENSTONE'S MUSIC ENSPIRED FROM MIDDLE EARTH.I FEEL IT IS THE VERY BEST MUSIC OF MIDDLE EARTH. BUT I RECOMMEND THIS MUSIC FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HOBBITS, WIZARDS, ANDADVENTURE........."
2,Should not put too much faith in Ginko,"Yes I am one of those persons that are in search of the memory panacea. Well, I do not find it in this product or most any product that has Ginko as the main ingredient. All I have read leads to my conclusion that ""Ginko"" does not work for me. I wasted my money. But the search continues."
1,Sandcastles/Born to be Sold DVD,Although I gave this item a good feedback - I had not watched the DVD before I did so. It looked like any other dvd I have seen but the quality is like a bootleg. The quality of the film on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best) is a one. Very disappointed in the quality. Very dark and blurred. For the money I paid - I am not happy with the purchase.
4,Pretty much as I remember it....,"Sandcastles -- saw this movie many years ago -- and it stuck with me. My goodness but Bonnie Bedelia was young! And Jan-Michael Vincent, perhaps not the greatest actor of his generation, but probably the best looking man born to woman, all-time. Slight and a bit corny, but touching all the same. The picture/sound isn't great, but it's perfectly watchable. Very glad to see this on DVD! Now if we could just get ""Baby Blue Marine"" and ""Tribes""...."
3,cute but average,Great idea not well executed. Sloppy construction - not all characters will stand due to variations in plastic bottoms. Music is so tinny that it is exceptionally annoying to listen to.
3,"Love Veggie Tales, but disappointed in quality of this toy","Our family has loved Veggie Tales ever since it's beginning, and have almost all the videos, so I was excited to get this nativity toy for my kids. It is very cute, but I was expecting a better quality toy for the price, which was $24.99 (normally $29.99) from the Veggie Tales website. I was hoping for something more like my Fisher Price set, but it was not like it at all. The plastic seems cheap and flimsy, and the recording of the song (which on mine is not ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" but some song I've never heard that says something like ""Jesus's love is kind and good"") is poor quality and the words of the song are hard to distinguish. My 3 and 5 year old have loved playing with it and we'll keep it, just because it's Veggie Tales. I just hope it lasts more than a couple seasons."
5,Great fun for older preschoolers,"This is a great toy for the older three to four range. They enjoy that all of the nativity characters are made up of the Veggie Tales characters, which they know and love. Children at this age level can identify them and identify with them. They have great fun sharing and playing cooperatively in either teams or groups of three. It is a classroom favorite."
5,What a treasure.,"Those of us who grew up in the 70s with vinyl and 8-track never dreamed the day would come when our albums would be unavailable or unplayable anymore. How wonderful that Anne Murray's albums have been remastered onto cds.Greatest hits are nice, but don't always contain all the songs you love by an artist. These two albums contain some great songs that I haven't been able to listen to in years. That silky voice singing some of her best songs during her Jim Ed Norman produced years.What a treasue to have these albums on cd."
5,A Probing and Thoughtful Book,"This short book argues a threefold thesis: first, that the same actions, events, texts, or phenomenon are perceived and interpreted from different points of view, e.g., commonsense, biology, theology, etc.; second, that these interpretations take place on several interacting levels, namely, as descriptions, as explanations, as evaluations, and as giving meaning; and third, that the resulting interactions between points of view and levels take three typical forms: rejection, absorption, and accommodation. A recurring motif is that genuine conflict is present and unavoidable, yet interaction continues to be inevitable. Thus accommodation ends up being the most adequate stance both descriptively and normatively. A truly thoughtful and probing book."
5,Our dog LOVES his bed,"Our shepherd mix (65#) Max - Loves his bed, Quick delivery on this item and item received as advertised. Nice thick cushion all around the bed."
4,Great bed for a snuggler,"Our puggle (30 lbs) likes to curl up in this bed. She has more than enough room in the medium size, but I bought it big so she can stretch out in the summer. The sides are nice and high so she can push up against the side and get comfy!"
5,dog bed,I did a ton of research before making this purchase. I found out that some peoples idea of large and mine are different. I have a 75 pound labrador retriever who loves having her bed to go to every night but the one she had was old and needed to be replaced. I was thrilled when I got this bed. It is large enough for her to be comfortable curled up or not and she loves her new bed.
4,Needed larger size,"Great bed! I took the opinions of the online reviews and manufacturer's as to what size to get. My dog weughs 76# but could have been more comfortable in one size larger. Otherwise, so far so good. He has only been using it for 3 days."
4,Large Dog Bed,"Nice bed, fast delivery only regret is that I didn't get the XL for our 55 lb Golden.She fits fine curled up but it's too small when she is stretched out."
2,JUST OK,I have labradors and cavaliers and none of them liked this bed. Fabric although weather resistant is not inviting and padding is lumpy. I eventually gave it away.
4,My Dogs LOVE this bed,"Over a year ago I bought this bed for my dogs, 2 black labs. If one isn't in it, the other one is...they both love the bed so I've decided I just need to get another so they each have one to call their own. It's worn well and cleaned up nicely after a small ""accident"". I would recommend it to others."
4,Nice!,"Unless you're trying to sleep in this yourself (which is tempting), it's perfect for the pooch. Appears to be a quality item. Only four stars because it is still untested. Looks just like the photo, nice weight to it, but not too heavy to move around easily."
5,Great bed!,"I ordered this on Amazon from PetSupplyFactory. My dog is 50 lbs, but I ordered the extra large. I didn't really pay attention to the measurements provided and when it got here I was shocked at how big it was! It came in a small box so I was actually afraid it was too small, but then when I popped it out, it was gigantic and way bigger than I expected! It seems like it is going to be very comfortable for my dog, and she seems to like it so far. The outer edges are almost like a pillow for her!"
2,Very little padding,"I recently purchased this item as a Christmas present for my 28 lb Cocker Spaniel as was very disappointed. Why the fabric is a decent quality the padding is almost non-existent. My dog like to sleep like the Lab in the picture but the padding in the donut part again is so soft and of little his chin sits in the ground. The picture is very deceiving and makes the bed look a lot nicer than it really is. I purchased the bed because the company's track record however I emailed them about returning the product a week ago (12/29) and no response. There price was only $5 cheaper than similar beds from Lands End, Ovris, LL Bean, or Dr. Foster and Smith. I have since replaced his bed with a much nicer one from one of the company's listed above. Bottom line don't waste your money."
2,Betrothal at a Tender Age: 'Twas Nothing New...,"Except that the gentleman was a kidnapper!Lady Lucinda Esmond's swine of a father was forever gleecing young bucks in London's gaming halls - until he met Captain Mark Chamfrey who, having been cheated, promptly kidnapped ten-year-old Luncinda for ransom!But, when Chamfrey thought better of it and returned the girl, Esmond exacted his own price: Chamfrey could save his skin by marrying his little victim nine years hence. Time enough for Chamfrey to inherit a title and fortune.Lucinda's father could not have foreseen what a beauty Lucinda would become. Nor that Chamfrey, a newly made marquess, might welcome the fulfillment of his punishment!"
3,What a great show,"Steve Austin is the man! The Six Million Dollar Man was the first real-life superhero I remember watching on T.V. as a kid. It was an original idea with great, state-of-art visual effects. You would laugh at them now but they were top notch when they came out. I would recommend this to any die-hard 1980s fans of military, sci-fi and comic-related T.V. show."
1,Great TV Show. But Time Life in Cheap! NO CC are SDH.,A great TV show.. But Time Life in cheap. NO CC are SDH for the Hard Of Hearing..I will get it when it comes out season by season with CC are SDH on it. I did just get season one. from Universal.. It has SDH on it...And will get season two when it hits the store.. Got the Bionic Woman also...;)
1,How can anyone like this song?,This song is just sooooooo bad! How the hell can anyone enjoy it? Don't buy this
3,Somewhat Pleased,The video would be great for those who are dressing for the first time and /or going to perform in public for the first time. I am a thespian vet so a lot of the make-up tips I already knew. The costuming part was helpful. I always enjoy seeing a performance at the end of a tape especially since they were in costume but 1 dance is enough. To me it seemed like the performance part went on for 10 minutes or more. I would have liked to see more instruction instead like how to fix your hair when you aren't wearing scarves. But that's JMO.
4,Very Cute!,"""Off the scale"" cute, but the only reasons I didn't give it five stars is because (1) the video is produced in short bursts. The longest continuous filming scene is probably ten seconds, with most much shorter (that makes it sort of jumpy), and (2) the audio is ""non-descript"" music, not really unpleasant to listen to, but certainly not pleasant. The first scene with ""Molly, Chews a Thing"" shown on the cover, is nice, as all the other kittens. I DO LIKE IT, but it could have been better."
2,Let's Go to the Zoo,"While Mr. Cuneo discusses each of the various Catholic positions taken by the persons and groups he mentions with some fairness (at least with respect to each other), all positions a serious Catholic might take were treated equally lightly, as if none of them could be taken seriously. One really gets the feeling that he exhibits each of them like animals in a zoo: ""...and in this cage we have the anti-abortionists, and over there are the sedevacantists...oh, look; the sedevacantists are making another pope; isn't that cute!"" At least one source is misquoted so as to make an invalid point. Although it is written so as to seem fair and objective, it actually gives the reader no good reason to join any of the fine groups of those who take their Faith seriously."
3,A Decent Glance,"Michael Cuneo has done a fair job of suppressing his own bias (without actually hiding it) when discussing those groups dissatisfied with the direction the Church has taken since Vatican II. If he is somewhat unfair to the 'so-called' conservatives, he is closer to the mark on the traditionalists. By suggesting that the conservatives have not produced any scholarship of note, he does beg the question of who is doing the noting.Yeoman work, but hardly the last word."
5,Sounds great plays like a guitar,"Can not say enough about this. It is great sounding,priced right and the shipping was quick. Some of my family thinks I am actually playing a banjo. ( I won't tell them any different"
4,"Very Clear, Systematic History of Creative Writing","As a teacher of writing, I found this book extremely interesting and clear. Myers provides a lucid, organized history of the evolution of the teaching of creative writing in this country. While the book will likely not appeal to a layperson, anyone who plans to teach creative writing or enroll in an expensive creative writing program has a stake in what Myers is saying. I am surprised by other reviewers' comments about Myers' view of creative writing (MFA) programs. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find Myers' remarks venomous or even especially harsh; rather, I found them even-handed and common-sensical."
2,dated and not terribly interesting,"I had hoped that this book would explore some of the changes in the pedagogical approaches to creative writing since 1880, but mostly, this book contains fairly dry history. Some of the assumptions (for instance, that any poet with an MFA can get a job) are no longer true. Its argument that universities have replaced the patron-based support of writers is marginally convincing, but one can't help but feel that the writer has a bit of a chip on his shoulder, as much as he tries to sound even-handed.If you're deeply interested in the history of who taught writing when and where and how programs have grown, than this book would be worth a read. Otherwise, I'd give it a pass."
5,elephants teach,"Perfect condition, the past users underlines helped too! The book is an arduous read but I have to know it so I'm glad I can share the experience with those who have gone before me."
5,Classic Shaw Brothers Masterpiece,"This movie has many pluses going for it.....that is if you can get a copy. First of all, it has Asian Movie Queen Ivy Ling Po in a great role & she again acts her heart out. This is an excellent tale of court intrigue.In addition to Ivy Ling Po, veteran actor Ching Miao also shines as the famous black-faced Judge Pao. Another Asian movie queen Li Ching appears in a guest spot as a ghost. We also see two veteran actresses Ouyang Sha-fei & Kao Pao Shu playing 2 rival empresses. Buy this tape before it goes out of print."
2,Codeword Dictionary,"To be honest, there is nothing wrong with Codeword Dictionary. It provides the Codewords for a great many operations and provides a brief description of each of them. It is useful on occasion to look up references that you find in other works, however most of the information is basic and is usually included in most other authors works on any particular topic. So while useful on occasion, you can easily get along without it."
3,book order..,The book was in fair condition as stated. It arrived in due time as noted on the shipping time. I'm content with my purchase.
3,Photoshop Restoration and retouching,Definitely for advanced beginner: Make sure you know your basics first. Also make sure you like to read as there are a lot of details to digest. If you are serious about restoration it will teach you a lot.
5,Excellent Photoshop Book,"Really detailed and an excellent source of knowledge for anyone that is interested in restoring or retouching images. I'm only part the way through the book and I've already found out heaps of ways to do things, and the background to why you are doing it and how it works."
4,Lost Without This Book,"Having been tipped by regulars at the Adobe Photoshop forum and in the process of restoring a whole collection of 10 to 150 year old family pictures, I was eager to obtain this book. It has been everything it claimed to be. As a novice to intermediate user of Photoshop in my first year of experience with it, I feel like I tripled my supply of tips and tricks. Beyond what I learned in the book, I have increased my willingness to tweak, temper, and experiment with the software. Almost all the examples in the book are provided on a website for download, allowing the reader hands on experience with each image. The entire file downloaded in minutes, using cable internet. My only concern so far is that the chapters are not necessarily as descriptive as they could be. It is easier just to flip through looking for something on which you need clarification."
5,The most important Photoshop book I own,"I have been in graphic design for 8 years, since Photoshop 5. I have purchased/read/borrowed every major book made for Photoshop from Peachpit and New Riders. From cheesy technique books, to instruction manuals, quick start guides, classroom in a books, and this is hands down, The most important Photoshop book I own."
4,The Cosby Show,"With the English subtitles, my family and I enjoy the Cosby Show even better.It was a great buy. My children have been watching them over and over again.Thanks a lot!!"
3,Cosby but.......,"Shows are great...some of televisions best, however, the dvd quality is bad. Two sets both with bad flaws such as skipping and scrambling. Also you must play episode by episode for alot of seasons."
3,Faulty DVD's,"I was really happy when I first opened the package and found the complete series of Bill Cosby. As I couldn't wait I started watching the DVD immediately. Only to found out in my disappointment that some of the DVD's had a problem and they got ""stacked"". I had to skip some episodes and that was really frustrating. I have 2 DVD players at home and they both couldn't read the DVD's. I don't know if I was just unlucky and got the problematic case, but I felt I should inform other potential buyers."
3,The Cosby 25th Anniversary Series,This was a Christmas purchase for a family member. They really enjoy the Cosby but some of the disc will not play correctly. This was a new package but has a few defects. May have to consired returning this item.
2,CosbyShowreview004,"So far, we've viewed shows from Season 1's first three discs. Each one has MAJOR skipping issues. One of the discs has black marks over it and it causes problems viewing each show in the DVD player.Please reply back to me to let me know what can be done to correct this issue. I've always wanted to own the complete series of the Cosby Show. However, so far, I haven't been able to enjoy the shows without interruptions.Sincerely,Dinah Patterson"
1,Skipping - Scrambled DVD's,"Please notice that I am not the first to report this... it seems pretty common. I ignored the reviews, hoping that my set would work fine. It did not. My DVD's are all in really bad shape, and non of them will play in any of our DVD players. They are not scratched, but more like smudged. It's under the clear coat, so it's a manufacturing issue for the DVD's that were used. I had to send it back, and it broke my heart! The Cosby Show was my favorite and I was really looking forward to my Codby Show Marathon this weekend! :("
3,Cosby Show 25th Anniversary,I love the Cosby Show and would have loved this product if it had worked properly. It is not packaged the way DVD's should be. The discs all slide in a cardboard sleeve and are most likely going to get scratched if they aren't already when you make your purchase. I am sending this product back for the 2nd time because of faulty discs. I am hoping the 3rd time around will be better.
5,Great,"We've only watched the first few episodes so far, but it's just what my wife wanted!It's the entire show!"
3,5stars for the show 2stars for dvd quality,very annoying defects in the dvd makes it a shame to such a great series.i would have waited till they made a new batch and rectified such bad production and i hope the peopleresponsible paid for doing such a rotten thing.
5,A well written and informative approach of one of the most elusive style of ships.,"I approached this book as an introduction to the subject of triremes. It was interesting to read how the authors came together to reconstruct one of the most investigated and yet elusive styles of ship building in ancient Greek history (since there is only artistic and literary evidence of a trireme, due to its construction, leaving no material remains). It gives a thorough insight into the study and developement of the trireme and the practical problems that arose in building it. It also gives information on the trial runs of the Olympias, their reconstruction of a trireme, and the amount of skill that was absolutley essential to rowing and maneuvering these ships in naval battles. I thought it was a good read and is a great place to start when entering the subject of triremes and ancient Greek naval warfare."
2,A Disappointment,"I purchased this book on the basis of the review listed here and was very disappointed when it arrived. The book is a cursory review of what we know about triremes from ancient sources and devotes a few pages to the most important battles. I learned FAR more from other books (some with contributions by the same author). The book has one short chapter on the reconstruction of the Olympias, the trireme currently operated by the Greek navy, and most of this was devoted to technical information of the most basic sort. I was hoping to read an account of how the project came together and what it was like for the people who participated. The title seemed to promise this. Nope. If the book were moderately priced I still couldn't recommend it. Hope the authors write a more personal account one day."
2,Nothing Special,"I concur with the previous reviewer; this disc definitely does not show the band at their best. Leslie, Felix, and Corky are all here, but they sound terribly rusty, and both Leslie and Felix flub lyrics to songs they had been singing for years. David Perry is also here, but (a la Steve Knight) makes no discernible contribution. In addition to the lackluster performance, the sound is little better than bootleg quality, and the clumsy editing only makes things worse. It's not as lousy as ""Twin Peaks"", but it comes close. This one is for completists only."
2,Where's the bass?!?,"At first, I was very disappointed with the bad recording. You can hardly hear the bass at all and without hearing Felix Papalardi, this is only half a Mountain album. BUT for the price, this is a good sample of Leslie West at his best. These live cuts really show that he was and is one of the best rock guitarists ever. Just remember, if you buy this album, be sure to adjust your bass levels and you'll almost feel like you're listening to Mountain."
4,Great HD TV for the price,"The previous review is accurate but a bit unfair. You cannot expect a High Definition TV to deliver high definition quality picture to television broadcasts or other input sources like DVD when those sources do not offer high definition resolution.For broadcasts which are offered in high definition, the color and clarity of image produced is spectacular. Some people who have seen programs on this set assume it's a plasma and are surprised to hear that it's not. Some have even said certain programs appear to have a 3-d quality. The quality of the HD is that good.Of course, the exterior is not as thin as a plasma set however for the size of the television, it's still thinner than most units.Overall, this is a great HD unit for the price. If you are not willing to spend the extra cash on a plasma set but want a great HD picture, this unit will meet your needs."
2,Not the best...,"The sewing machine was very hard to thread, and the thread would get caught while I was sewing, resulting in multiple re-threads and broken stitching. I think the concept is great, and I loved the mini sewing kit that it came with, but the frustration was not worth it. It broke after 5 or 6 uses..."
1,....want to pull your hair out...buy this.,This item worked while it was all setup from the box...but I could not repeat the process.There are other good deals out there ..ie more substantial machines.I bought one for $50..that works....a Euro Pro.
3,wankerWho.,"I'm not sure if this has already been discused and argued about and then settled, but I was at a nine inch nails website that had close up pictures of the Into the Void Single on it, there was no Halo number but on the Into the Void Promo used for radio stations which only has the album version and radio edit of the song says that it is Halo 16. But, on all previews of the upcoming ""Things Falling Apart"" it is labled as Halo 16 as well. oh well"
5,track listing?,Please someone put a track listing here. I can't find it even on nine inch nail websites!
3,Not a Halo!!!!,"Just to set some things straight...I just came from nin.com and nothingrecords.com and accessed a list of all halo's. Halo 15 was WITT and Halo 16 is going to be the new remix cd due Oct 24. This does not mean that this single is not worth owning, just don't buy it thinking you have to have it to complete the halo's. 16 is coming soon, so hold out."
4,I think there's something missing,"There's 2 versions of this single-- One with the tracks listed which is the Australian version and the Japanese version (this one.) On the Australian version inside the CD it says halo_sixteen .... This one doesn't. I guess that thing about it was a trick. But this one has its regular tracks (Into The Void CD and vinyl versions) plus hidden tracks from We're In This Together (That song, from #2 and #3 and 2 other songs from that) and #2's The New Flesh (also a bonus track on the vinyl edition of The Fragile) plus The Perfect Drug (and you can get it almost everywhere including: the Lost Highway soundtrack, Closure, and WITT version 3.) Buy this if you're a collector."
3,Not for collectors,This album is not recomended to NIN collectors because it's not a halo and because you can find all the tracks on other discs. On the other hand the c.d is made up of only good NIN songs and is great for riding in the car. If you don't collect NIN music than this c.d is probably for you.
1,Need info on this title.,I need to know if this is an official Halo release. If it is it should be Halo 16. Please let me know if you have this title and it is.
2,Halo ?,"This item is in a cardboard sleeve which does not feature any HALO numbers.The tracks may all be found on the various releases of ""We're In This Together"" - but at least they chose some of the better ones :)If you don't have 'The Fragile' AND the WITT singles then this is a good purchase with two good album tracks, a remix and the original version of 'The Perfect Drug'."
3,Forget it,"Who needs this? Into the Void and We're in This Together are on The Fragile; and The Perfect Drug and The New Flesh on the far better We're in This Together singles. Now this isn't even a good collector's item, because unlike the other Halos it doesn't even have a neat design (even paper sleeve!). Not even I as a hardcore NIN collector will include this one in my collection. By far the worst NIN CD that ever came out. Still three stars because of the five-star song quality, but otherwise completely unnecessary."
5,GEEZUZ!!!!,"LOOK AT THAT PRICE! LUCKEY I BOUGHT THIS YEARS AGO. FOR 25 BUCKS! HA! OK A LOT ARE COMPLAINING CUZ THIS IS DOES NOT HAVE A HALO NUMBER, BUT THIS IS PRETTY COOL CD TO HAVE. YOU GET INTO THE VOID, AND WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER (they can be found on the fragile or halo 14) THE PERFECT DRUG (from the lost highway soundtrack, this version is slighty longer) AND THE NEW FLESH (witch can be found on the we're in this together halo 15, i forget witch part this is from) ANYWAYS BY THIS AND YOU WON'T BE SORRY. ARTWORK: 3/10. SONG: 10/10. COVER: 2/10."
4,Great Book but a little out of date!,"This was the first for kids by kids book I ever owned! Now I own them up to the 2000. This book now is a little useless but still accurate! If you want a more up-to-date book buy the 2000 or 2001 addition. This book could still help but not as well as it did in 1996. Some things aren't in the book that exist now including whole parks or hotels. Some things in the book aren't there any more. For example this book says 20,000 legues under the sea is still there but it has been replaced by Ariel's Gotto. I should know I have only missed going there 1 year since I was 2. I'm 12 now! I missed 1999. I hope I've helped you choose which book to purchase now!!"
3,floot mats for f 150,"The mats are well made, durable and tough. I was a little disappointed with the fit. There floor mats are not a perfect fit for a F150. On the passenger's side, there was a small raised area on the floor mat because it did not fit exactly in the space. Most probably would not notice, but it I was always pushing the mat down into contact with the floor board."
5,"Funny, clever, beautifully shot","Louie CK is the best comic working today and his one-man show (he writes, directs and stars in it) just keeps getting better. Great guest turns by Melissa Leo and Parker Posey and writing that is sharp and poignant without veering into sentimentality. Each episode is like a self-contained short narrative film, beautifully shot and scored with a jazz soundtrack, Louie's not afraid to take risks with his writing and his casting and delivers something unexpected each week. Highly recommended."
5,Amazing,This is one of the best television episodes I have ever seen. It was nice to see Louie triumph in his own somewhat downtrodden way.
4,Louis is a Boy,"In this episode we get to meet Louis ex-wife, she's hot, sexually and socially active and is played by an African American- what's that supposed to mean? She's earthy, no-nonsense, and cool?Meanwhile Louis' almost significant other also has his number. She realizes what is going on even before he does and makes everything so easy for him, including avoiding unnecessary heartbreak.Loved the whole motorcycle bit, the look the salesman gives him when he says, ""So buying a motorcyle is the smart thing to do?""""What about Obama?!"" the old lady patient cries out, so true, so sad. I should know I live in SW Fla. God's waiting room."
1,Horrible,"I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I fine this series not funny at all. It's full of talk of oral sex and stupidity. If I could, I'd get my money back. Don't waste your time or money"
1,Terrible episode,"Spoiler Alert.I""m used to this show taking a sudden left turn and being weird all of a sudden. But this episode was a giant WTF. It starts out good with Louie going to the store to buy a dvd player. But it's followed by an extremely boring and weird conversation with his uncle who takes forever to say ""go see your father"" The end of this episode makes absolutely no sense.I want my $2 back."
1,worse episode ever,"This was the worse episode of the season ever.I generally loved all his episodes from the two previous season but have just liked a couple episodes of the third.What I liked about the first two seasons he's almost totally gotten away from,now it's just a mishmash of disjointed scenes.No longer looking forward to the next episode as they just seem to be getting worse with each one."
4,Beautifully Crazy,"Haven't reviewed a Louis episode yet, but I felt compelled after watching this episode. Very moving episode, but not necessarily in a way that makes you want to just cry. It moves you to points of uneasiness, to points of humor, reflection, etc. Words really can't describe this episode. You have to watch it to understand."
2,not funny,"pointless, non-sensical, horribly un-funny end to my curiosity was about the great louis ck. wanted to like but each epidode just gets worse, goes a little deeper off the wt? end. no longer curious."
1,Compared to the Free Wikipedia CD version 0?,"Lots of information but I wonder how this compares to the free wikipedia schools CD, the first version of which you can download or get on CD for free? I think these paid CDs are no longer worth the money and the WP one keeps getting improved and re-released. You can find the WP CD by googling for ""2006 Wikipedia CD"" or at FAQs at Wikipedia. Browse online and compare for yourself"
4,Works ok - but thanks for having an obscure character,"My daughter is very interested in Code Lyoko, even though it's hard to get. Thanks for making this product."
4,Golden Recipes,"This is a small book but has a total of 8 recipes to try. I have made 18K Hash twice, and it's simple and good tasting! An easy book for the younger people to read and tells you what type of equipment needed to make each meal. Also provides history of the gold rush and why certain food was made. A good book to have of the bookself and use from time to time! I really liked this book but wished it could have had even more recipes in it."
5,Beautiful,"I almost did not purchase these because they looked really red in the picture, but they were such a good buy I could not resist. They are the most beautiful shade of brown with amber tints - not red at all - gorgeous!!"
3,Quick but not right,"The seller got the book to me in a timely manner, unfortunatly, the text that I received was not the right edition. The title, edition, and picture matched when I ordered it but not when it arrived."
5,Another great resource,Must have for any special ed teacher whether your are just starting out in the profession or you have been teaching for 15 years..This is a great tool.
5,Writing Measurable IEP Goals and Objectives,"Extremely helpful book. Our county has adopted the Maryland State IEP format this year. Having read this book, I feel much more prepared to produce meaningful documents that will meet the needs of my students and measure their progress."
1,Not Recommended,I bought this book hoping to see some good examples of IEP goals that I could revise in order to put them in the IEPs I write for students with specific learning disabilities. I found this book not helpful at all. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Useful examples,"I found the examples very useful, to give me a guideline when I'm creating my own IEP's."
4,Good Basic Book,This ia good basic book to help parents and teachers see how their goals should be written.
2,Censored Series,"I hate to say it, but not that great a DVD set. No bonus features on the show, and missing episode #6 Wisconsin."
3,Hard 'N' Heavy (With Marshmallow),"This album was a bit of a comeback effort on the charts after the poor showing of ""Something Happening"" but it still didn't crack the Top 50 on Billboard's pop album charts. Hits include ""Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon"" & ""Cinderella Sunshine"". The latter has two versions on the album, the 45 version and an album version that's considerably different. The best album cut is ""Time After Time""; after that the tracks fall off. This album has a better reputation than that of their previous album but they are both close to equal. The bonus track ""Do Unto Others"" is an outstanding song that was issued as a B side on a 45. This song has always been one of my favorites by them, and, in fact, was the deciding factor in purchasing this album."
3,"Up In The Sky...It's A Bird, It's A Plane, It's...Condorman?","Yes, it's Condorman, vulture of the western world and superhero/spy extraordinare! Disguised as mild-mannered comic book writer/illustrator Woody Wilkins (Michael Crawford) by day, Condorman must fight a never ending battle to save the world from the ever growing forces of evil that threaten to engulf it, while at the same time trying desperately to protect his beautiful Russian spy girlfriend Natalia (Barbara Carrera) from the clutches of the villainous Krokov (Oliver Reed)!Highlighted by a well above average cast and an exciting musical score composed by the one-and-only Henry Mancini, and loaded with tons of adventure, action and excitement...""Condorman"" is certainly a very fun movie to watch and is one that can be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how young or old they may be!"
3,"Low-quality filmmaking, yeah, but still entertaining","I saw this movie for the first time in third grade and LOVED it. I recognize now that (probably due to the time period in which it was made) it's not the best quality movie, but it does have some cool ideas. The whole gypsy truck turned sports car turned hovercraft thing is too cool. If anything, the kid in me still loves the idea of a cartoonist turning into a spy/superhero."
3,Great Spoof,"I rented the film for $1.99 because I found the sale price way too high. It's a charming, funny, lighthearted spoof of the secret agent genre. I'm a big Michael Crawford fan and this is the only work available where he's not lost in the character like Forum or Dolly. I wish he'd done more film work post-Phantom of the Opera. He has a true gift for comedy."
5,"Condorman: A Seriously funny, romantic and fast paced Movie","A movie by Walt Disney Productions (Circa 1981) and a suprisingly funny, romantic and most of all fast paced and exciting spoof on the James Bond Film genre. The characters are memorable and fun to look at from a post Cold War point of view,"
1,Absolutely dreadful!,"This is a terrible film -- low-budget seat-of-the-pants filmmaking with an exceedingly thin plot line. But in a way, it's still worthwhile viewing for fans of the sublime Oliver Reed, who makes a wonderfully sinister villain (Russian this time); and Michael Crawford, who is his usual endearing self. The latter's performance in ""Condorman"" is reminiscent of his role as Cornelius Hackel in ""Hello Dolly,"" which is to say it's about as far away from the Phantom as you can get. Still, the film is amusing at times. But check out ""The Assassination Bureau"" if you're an Oliver devotee."
2,choix des seigneurs,"i enjoy review this pictures because it was wonderfull like marvels heros and more funny i think but i don't find it.i hope that you have it to send me, thanks."
1,Miserable garbage.,"Grade-Z spy spoof starring the insufferable Michael Crawford, who would fortunatly redeem himself as the Phantom. The movie plays like one of those bad low-budget afternoon adventure shows on the USA Network. And the special effects are dreadful. Sure, the movie is targeted toward children, but even they will notice that the wires are easily visible when Condorman flies. This isn't uncommon in special effects movies (even the most expensive productions have their faults), but in this case the wires are so visible and distracting (they almost look like ropes) it ruins the entire fantasy element. I'm surprised Disney even greenlighted this project. Pathetic."
4,Condorman dvd,"This is such a fun movie. We actually purchased it in the dvd format after having it in vhs when our children were younger. When our son got married this summer, he and his bride-to-be listed some dvds that they would like. Although not officially part of the list, he verbally mentioned Condorman, so we bought it. The problem is the audio is not of very good quality. I was disappointed, because that really did effect its entertainment value."
4,Love the Condorman!!!!,"James Bond comic book style by Disney. Brought to life from a comic book figure the writer entangles himself by falling in love with another agent from the other side that wishes to defect shortly after they meet in an simple document exchange. Upon her choice she will only defect if the pick up and transfer is done by Condorman!!! As this is the name the writer provided when they met. It is a cool adventure through the countryside with hang gliding, a gypsies truck that turns into a race car and then a hydrofoil with awesome care and boat chases through the Italian Mountains. So Kick back and Enjoy a great movie!!!!"
5,High flying fun,Corny but a lot of fun. Have been looking for this DVD for quite some time. Big names in the cast that truly fit the different characters.
1,THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT (MUST READ),"IF you know about webkinz, you might know about the e-shop (a online store where you can buy overly priced anamated items, and pets with out a stuff animal). People are taking avantege of others when they sell there anamated pets on ebay for more than they are worth. I just wanted to tell you all that you can buy this pets on the e-shop for $12.50, the speical pets(like the floral fox) are sold on certant days,like webkinz Wednesday,surprise Saturday,and super Sunday."
4,Webkinz Chichuahua,"The item was received promptly and was as expected, it was not any better or worse quality than was discribed in the specifications. Cute."
4,"Stuffed amimal, computerized/registered toy",My niece is having a lot of fun with this webkin online as well as her brother with his. Their cousins hacve chows and they love then and her brother got one in Virginia so I wanted to get her one. She loves hers.
5,Webkinz Chihuahua,"Ordered this for Christmas. My little boy has been collecting Webkinz for a while now, and he loved this Chihuahua! Very durable and plush and just a cute little guy!"
5,Solace from Amazon!,"My grandson hugged this little dog so tightly while his father, a surgeon,stitched up a tear to his ear after a minor accident Christmas morning. He wassqueezing this one with two other webkin and they sure helped! Thank you,They mean so much to children!"
3,Webkinz Chihuahua,"The item is a real Webkinz, new tags and all. I purchased it as an addition to my collection, I am trying to get the very first ones made and especially looking for those without the Magic ""W"". I believe there are other ways for a child to be educated and entertained. A short period of time with a Webkinz on a computor might be better used as a reward for other responsibilites that have been well done by a child."
1,Pitiful!,I order from Amazon all the time and this is my first negative review - that's how bad this product is. The face of the dog is deformed and it looks old and matted. It looks NOTHING like the dog in the photo. I'm very disappointed and will not use this vendor again
4,"My chihuahua lover, loves it","Personally I think the stuffed dog is not proportioned very well and not all that cute but my 8 year old thinks ""she"" is absolutely perfect. She loves taking care of her dog on the website. This was our first official Webkinz purchase. We had a lot of the stuffed animals that we'd received second hand but now my daughter discovered the website aspect so we had to buy a new one so she could use the ""code""."
2,"Great for knowing moves, not much for fatalities","I recently got this guide a couple of days ago thinking I was gonna be able to learn all the moves and secret characters and fatalities. Well to my surprise, this strategy guide doesnt have all that. Only a few of the characters fatalities are given, hardly any of the new ""Hara-Kiri"" fatalities are given and the walkthrough that is given only covers the obvius missions, none one the secret ones. If you wanna get all the info on the secret characters and all the fatalities, mind you that each character has 2 fatalities and a Hara-Kiri, the guide tells you to check out their website. Now I know what everybody who bought the Final Fantasy 9 guide must have gone through. So if your expect to learn all the fatalities and finding all the hidden stuff with this guide, your gonna be dissapointed."
1,completely useless,"stupid. $14.99 for nothing. It has maybe 4 fatalities, and like 2 hara-kiris. And the konquest guide is no help. ""Go to location A-8."" Like I know where A-8 is! And there is no help for side missions. Only primary missions. And there are many grammar mistakes. And it doen't cover anything about the krypt! Of all things, this is one of the most important. Nobody cares about every single little move a character has. We want their fatalities! And some of the special moves are not even right. Don't get it look on the internet."
1,Good thing Wal-Mart lets you return stuff.....,"I'm so glad I bought this guide at Wal-Mart as opposed to an actual videogame store. I bought it for the Fatalities, the Konquest mode, and the Krypt. This strategy guide had NO INFORMATION!!!! It actually said to look up info online! I even went to the website listed and it still had no info. Besides, I have gamefaqs.com if I want to get guides online. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Mortal Kombat: Deception Official Strategy Guide (Brady Games Signature),One think I can say is that it sucks!It didn't help me finish the konquest game of mortal Kombat deception. Don't even waste your money on this!
5,"For once, a walking tape that is worth listening too!","I am a fitness pro and I love having music to work out or to walk to. I have bought walking tapes in the past and each time I was disheartened to find perfectly great songs ruined by a new cheest rendition by some unknown singer who has no vocal talent at all. However, I took my chances on this audio and I am thankful!! There is no room for cheese here as the instruments shine through your favorite classical song of Mozart, Bach, and more! Definately for the classical music fan at heart and soul."
3,Take the previous reviewers comments with grain o salt,"I love thai food, and enjoy going out to restuarants on a regular basis. Based on this one review, I was expecting decent to good Thai food.The green curry was not very good at all. The sauce was runny and wasn't all that flavorful. I was expecting a little more kick, or spices but it just wasn't there.This isn't bad for 2 lunches per box, but for dinner it leaves something to be desired. I even added green onions and chili paste to kick it up a notch and made it slightly acceptable.I have made Thai food in the past from scratch (I have all the ingreidents). Sometimes, I am just too lazy to spend the time to put it all together. So for something quick, this isn't too bad, but don't expect 5 stars."
1,The last Star wars film,This movie stink It has great Graphics I will give it that but this is not Star Wars this is horrible Dave Filoni needs to have a personal date with vader and let his lightsaber kill him Revenge of the Sith was the best film of the films while this one was the worse thanks Dave for destroying a classic .
1,Dissapointed,"Very dissappointed in this order, due to the seller. Seller said Video Game was New. New does not mean the disk is scratched, not in original wrapping, and not missing the instructions that come with a NEW purchase. This was defiantely used.We contacting the seller first to give them a chance to fix this before we wrote a bad review and they did nothing to resolve this issue.I have made hundreds of Amazon purchases, this is the FIRST I have given a bed review to."
2,It could have been so much better.,"What a let down. After watching and totally enjoying the first Clone Wars cartoons, I was sadly disappointed when this was released. All of the characters appear carved from stone with their total lack of facial expression, and it is very distracting. If they had told the same story as a real cartoon, and not this cg garbage, it would have made a HUGE difference. Do your self a favor and skip these video game cut scenes and go find the real Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons, still available used on Amazon."
3,Ehhh,"My son was very excited to get this movie, but only watched it once. It is a bit boring, but maybe that is just my take on it. Kids may enjoy it, but son (who is 9) did not, and he is a big Star Wars fan. The animation is good, just the story line dragged on a bit."
1,Purchased in error,"I purchased this movie in error, so I've never watched it. The movie was very expensive. I would have never purched a movie that cost so much. I wish I could've deleted it ant received a refund, but by the time i figured out I had purched it, it was too late to reverse it."
3,"Good, but not as good as the original movies","I think that this is an interesting movie, but not as good as the original six movies. It's animated, and it gets boring after two views. Buy the original ones."
5,Great Star Wars Movie,This is a must own for any Star Wars Fan out there young and old!!Get ready for a Action packed movie i wont spoil any of it for anyone that has not seen it. A 5/5 stars for sure!
5,great movie,The Force is with us in this movie that takes place after Star Wars Episode Two. A must wath for any force user.
2,Worst. Star Wars. Ever.,"Voice over? VOICE OVER? Since when does a Star Wars movie start with a poorly read voice over? What happened to the opening scroll? That is just the begining of a movie riven with poor voice acting, poor dialogue, a shotgun pattern of plot holes and clunky animations. The lightsaber battles are underwhelming. The story overall does nothing to move the Clone Wars story forward. Terrible.The DVD transfer is excellent as is the sound quality. Its a shame the movie is so bad."
3,Good start for the TV series,"Not really a movie, but episode 0 of a TV series. And the TV series is great!"
1,From worst to OMG,"This movie was, is and always will be the worst movie in the Star Wars Saga. This mountain of a terd should have been created. Ok CGI is not bad but the story does not follow the events that happened in the movies or books. Don't bother with this !"
2,Dear George Lucas,"STOP SCREWING WITH THIS FRANCHISE, I BEG YOU. Episodes 4 - 6 practically re-invented the sci-fi genre, but then Episodes 1 - 3 took a serious downturn, due in no small part to the mis-casting of Hayden Christensen and also the violation of what you had set up in 4 - 6. George, what was the point of this film? Where in the timeline of the series does this movie fall? Why didn't we see Anakin's padawan in any of the live-action films? Why have plot and character been sacrificed at the altar of the aciton sequence? Granted, this is an animated movie, which usually means a kid's movie, and with their short attention spans, things have to be kept moving, but understand their parents are the same people who saw Episdoes 4 - 6 when they were kids themselves and are ruining it for them. You are ruining this once-great franchise, so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP SCREWING WITH IT!!! Thank you.PS: May the Force be with you again, because you've certainly lost it."
1,Probably one of the more awful things I have ever watched.,"Everything in this entire movie was shallow. The dialog was so poorly written and repetitive that it hurt my head. They repeatedly stated the plot verbally so many times that a 3 year old with ADD and an IV drip hooked up to a bag of sweet tarts dissolved in sprite couldn't lose track of what was going on. Sure, maybe kids will like it, in the sense that kids like a lot of trash, you can show kids other better things and they'll still like them. The argument, ""kids will like it"" is pretty shallow praise. After the original 2d animated series I had very high hopes for this film and was just entirely let down by the whole thing."
1,A major disapointlment.,Watch the 2005 Cartoon Network Non-CGI animated series of shorts and you'll know what I mean when I say this doesn't measure up. The 2005 shorts deal much more with the other films. After watching those the CGI cartoons just lack so much. The least of which is connection and relivence to the movies. I recomend true Star Wars fans skip this all together.
1,The Worst Movie of All Time,"If you are about to buy this, DON'T!This film is absolute crap.The story is crap, the acting is crap, the animation is crap, everything is crap.If you want to introduce your young children to Star Wars, this is not the way to do it. Show them A New Hope instead. This garbage is not worth your time of day. Please do not buy this."
1,Garbage put out there to make $$$$,Thank You George Lucas!!!! Finally I am free of ever thinking or caring about anything having anything to do with Star Wars ever again!! This is so close to being the worst movie of all time it made me HATE Star Wars and I used to be a fan. All I can say is Thank You!! Thank You George Lucas for total lack of artistic integrity and total disregard for quality!! Keep shoveling the crap out there and destroying the name of a once respectable film series!!
5,My 3 boys and I love it!!!,"My 3 young boys and I watch this movie and love it......a new generation in my family get to know the starwars universe. They love Commander Rex, Cody, Fox, R2D2....and of coarse lightsabers. The voice-over for Obi wan is just perfect!!! Love seeing Ben in his prime. Cant wait for the Season one DVD of the cartoon series."
3,Clone Wars Had Such Potential...,"And yet, we get a mediocre story with okay voice acting and pretty gorgeous computer animation. The whole thing is just one big piece of eye candy. The square-faced look takes some getting used to, but it is rather nice in an artistic kind of way.The script's terrible. The only good lines were given to the battle droids. ""Why?!!!!!!!!!"" (as it is getting chucked off the platform)The changed opening was just tacky.The battle scenes were decent, but not amazing, hence 3 stars and not 1 or 5."
3,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"Most fans of the Star Wars movies will enjoy this animated filler that gives us some background information about what happened between Star Wars Episode II and III. The graphics won't impress you to the point you say, wow that's good, but they are decent enough that you shouldn't mind watching them. The storyline is also good enough to hold the interest of most people that liked the movies. Worth at least a rental. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury"".CA Luster"
4,Fun movie.,"This is a fun take on the Star Wars universe. It was made to set up the kid's show that is now in its third season on Cartoon Network. There are significant changes from the traditional Star Wars movies that we fell in love with, but they are all acceptable. It is clearly made for children to enjoy, but even adults can have a good time watching it. If you keep a lighthearted mindset throughout and expect to enjoy it, then you will."
4,not as bad as you think,First off I thought this was going to be the worst aspects of star wars dumbed down for kids consumption.While there are those elements they aren't anywhere as bad as the movies.Granted the Asokha (sic) is fairly annoying she couldn't hold a candle to whiny Anikan.I was reluctant to get it due to the various complaints I had heard. I felt I would be lost if I got the series and didn't have the movie.What I found is that the themes that carry through all the Star Wars franchise are here. The whinny kid apprentice is the main one I was afraid of.Makes me wonder how George really feels about teens and pre-teens. I'm aware that the movie had a fairly heavy hand of Lucas involved. I also know that as the series progressed he wasn't as involved. So I hope this was helpful and cleared up some of the same issues or misconceptions about the movie as I had if you are on the fence regarding this purchase.
4,"Disappointed in WB, not the film","Be forewarned that even though the description says the Blu Ray comes with a digital copy of the film, the chance to download it expired in November of 2009. Other than that, an underated film that has led to a good series on TV."
3,"I want to say this movie sucks, but ill say this","The movie is more/less a half made Star Wars product that is geared towards padawans.If this movie was made for an older crowd, i think it would of been better.The movie did have awesome clones VS droid battles..... but the movie could not keep me awake."
3,The Clone Wars,Not a bad movie. My 8 year old loves star wars and watches the show every friday night.
5,movie,The item came exactly as described and very quickly. I was impressed with how quickly it was shipped out and arrived.
1,Are you f'ing kidding me?,This is so amateur it's almost unbelievable. Tom and Jerry was like the Mona Lisa compared to this drivel.
2,"Mostly a period piece, but you still might like it...","if you like Zindel. Although ""My Darling, My Hamburger"" and some of his other books get criticized for being dated, this book is the only Zindel book that I think is really a period piece. The main character, a bored teenager, falls in love, or at least in lust, with a wacky teenage girl who steals drugs, cleans house in the nude, and has long conversations with him about finding oneself and other early-70s themes. It was considered ""hip"" and ""racy"" for 1970s youth readers (and came in a cool psychedelic paperback jacket then) but now it mostly just seems silly. I'd recommend it for Zindel fans only, or those who like books about teens in previous eras. The coolest thing about it is probably its title."
2,No fue lo que esperaba,"Acostumbro a comprar libros de esta autora ya que la considero una de las mejores. Sin embargo este libro no me sorprendio en lo absoluto. Me parecio mas o menos, pero considero los demas libros de Doreen muchisimo mejor que este."
1,Definitely not a much awaited sequel,"If you love Gone With the Wind, you will not like this sequel by a different author. For those who liked the historical fiction element in Gone With the Wind, it is no longer there in this sequel.My biggest problem, however, is that Scarlett is transformed into a completely different character. She is nothing like she is in Gone With the Wind. It's like she's a completely different person.Save your brain the pain of reading this book- it hurts more to read it than to not have read it at all."
2,Iffy,"I ordered this collection, as a childhood favorite of mine... The movies themselves are great... The packaging had flaws- some of the discs were loose in their cases and were jumbling around as I opened the box... Luckily, no major damage.... My BIGGEST PROBLEM would be that on my first movie, although there IS sound, there are no voices.... The background music plays, general movement sounds are there, but when the characters talk, their lips move and no sound comes out.... It's baffling to me- I don't know how this is possible, but it makes the movie practically unwatchable with no dialogue whatsoever... I suspect I may have gotten bootlegs or something? I clearly don't understand how the voices are just GONE.... Pretty disappointed... Luckily, I tested the second movie and the voices are there..."
3,"Good package, but can be confusing","I recently purchased this box set, because my wife and I both really enjoyed the first two Subspecies films. When I received the box set, movies 3 & 4 were mislabeled (3 was 4 and vice versa), but the set as a whole was still enjoyable. If you like cheesy vampire films, this is recommended highly."
3,Good price slow slow shipping.,"I found it for a good price but It took way too long to arrive. I tried contacting the seller time after time and nothing.. After about a week of constant messaging I finally got a response, saying that my item was sent back to them due to shipping error. Yeah right.. lame excuse. Beware! Do not buy from unless you are okay with waiting a long time to receive your item and you will most likely never get them to message you back."
4,Gotta love Radu,"I hold my hands up and honestly say i love the Subspecies films,i love the authentisity,i love the atmosphere,i love Radu's long wobbly fingers and messy eating habits,yeah i love these films,cheap,oh so cheap but good.Its such a shame the film images haven't been cleaned up or remastered at all,they have the look of old video tapes but not even that ruins their spell over me.Where the Radu Subspecies movies are dirty,squalid (and lovely) the Vampire Chronicles episode is aiming for the oppulance of Interview With A Vampire, it almost hits the mark as well,it has a sumptious quality and style that is the other end of the spectrum to the Radu films but they meet perfectly.If you're a Goth (like me) if you like vampires (like me) then sink your teeth into this boxset,worth every penny (though the outer box is flimsy)"
3,subspecies,"I had seen a couple of these movies previously and purchased the collection to fill in the gaps in my viewing, I shouldn't have bothered, just more of the same with no real plot or character development."
5,Subspecies,"For years, I have been looking for the complete set on DVD but could never find the first two; they were only available on VHS. I am glad I waited; made lots of popcorn and enjoyed watching every movie."
5,Subspecies (The Epic Collection),"these movies are in line with the old view of vampires, they are blood sucking monsters. Go Radu!!!! they should do a remake of all the movies with modern tech. of today that would be awesome."
5,My best Favourite Vampyre Movie Ever!,"For Vampyres Movie lovers SUBSPECIES it's a must! I love Rumania, the music of this film is amazing, Anders Hove and Denice Duff makes the main attraction of the movie. Ted Nicolau it's a great director as well and he created a legacy in vampyre movies of the 90's."
1,Poorly made.,"I wore these two times and the crotch busted. I bought the correct size and they were not too tight. In fact, they were a bit loose. I washed them using Woolite hand washing detergent.I had a pair of these before and found they were like pantyhose, only with a higher pricetag.Save your money. The quality isn't there. You'd be better off going to your local retail merchant like Target and buying a more substanial product.The only good thing is that the product does make you look better in pants or whatever you're wearing.I just think they could be made more durable."
2,price to high for quality of product,Product was priced to high for the quality of item...not as I thought according to discription
1,I'm disappointed!,I received an e-mail stating that my item was shipped but that was weeks ago and still no merchandise! I will rate this merchant as poor until I receive what I have paid good money for.
1,Horrible Book,"This book is by far the absolute worst book ever. Please save your money and invest in a much better book.The author is clearly very one-sided, and takes a very strong defensive stand. His strong negativity comes out starting in only the third chapter. He says that malnutrition is impossible in the USA and that no one living in the USA has any nutritional deficiencies. This is obviously false and the author is very ignorant towards homeless people, poor people, and the elderly which can very easily and quickly become deficient in various vitamins and minerals. After reading that in the book I simply could not trust anything else he wrote, and was very happy to burn the book.If you want a good, complete nutrition book, I highly recommend ISBN-13: 978-1592574391. It's the book I purchased after this one to learn all the fundamentals of nutrition (and exercise)."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is outdated, biased, and more opinion based than fact based. Contrary to the cover page quote by John H. Renner, MD., President, Consumer Health Information Research Institute, ""every family does NOT need one [this book]"". Because of Renner's endorsement, the credibility of the Consumer Health Information Research Institute just went down the tubes. Don't waste your money. Good grief, there must be a better and more current resource out there. I'm looking..."
1,Bias,I bought this book to learn about nutrition. Not be inundated by your beliefs (not FACTS). I will not recommend this book.
2,This is not a book I would recommend.,"This book was written by several authors, but they had two things in common--a lack of footnotes and a condescending attitude toward the reader. It was also disturbing that some authors seemed to find certain serious illnesses amusing."
1,"Very disappointing, stay away from this one!","I purchased this book because it had a section on nutrition for infants, but it turned out to be a very long book with no detailed information. (Over 800 pages, but the recommendation for infants aged 1 - 2 years included a suggestoin to feed ""Sweets to meet caloric needs"" with no definition as to what these caloric needs are. (I admit I was suprised to learn that I was supposed to feed my infant sweets.) Victor Herbert also spends a considerable amount of time looking down his nose at anybody who would sell Vitamin supplements. He believes that any vitamins, such as a multivitamin, or vitamin E or C supplements are completely worthless. His references for this information appears to be the many articles he himself has written over the years. He apparently makes quite an income on dubunking other nutritionists while offering absolutely no scientific evidence of his own. This book is 800 pages of his opinion - I wasted my money - don't waste yours!"
2,Not exactly the future,"If you're looking for innovative computer-generated graphics and a thumping dance beat, look somewhere else. For a video that should pride itself on the clarity of the graphics, they are grainy and uninventive. The same images are repeated over and over, the lack of detail is annoying, and the music could be alot better. It's pretty much a mix of trance and house, but nothing new or innovative. Do yourself a favor: save your money and go listen to a CD while watching a colorful screen saver."
2,Very Very Unhappy.....,We bought this travel system because it was nice looking and so compact. We used it for the first 5 1/2 months with the car seat attached and then when our daughter could finally sit up we started using it alone. Now the stroller works horrible. If the driving surface is smooth at all the right front wheel just drags and you can't steer it. The frame is very weak and it squeaks loudly every time you turn a corner. Also the wheels are made of the cheap plastic and they wear down very quickly. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you only want to use it when your baby is little.
3,Good for a smaller travel system,"I want to start out by saying Graco usually makes good products. When I saw this was coming out I was very excited because my quatro tour travel system is rather large. I wanted something smaller and a little more portable. The fact is I found this stoller rather awkward. It was hard to fold up quickly - unlike what I was used to, and the stroller itself did not provide as much support to my 5 month old daughter as my quatro tour does. I will say that if you are short on room or have a small car this is probably a good option, but I returned mine and just purchased a maclaren umbrella stroller. My quatro tour fits fine in my camry and my daughter is much happier in it than the mosaic. As far as the car seat goes, it is great as all graco snug rides are."
5,"I book with mystery, and adventure","A twisting plot. One of the best Noel Streatfeild books ever. Please put it back in print with the ""Shoe"" books that are out of print (also by Noel Streatfeild.)"
3,"Dog loves it, but I don't after reading the ingredients","First thing first, my dog goes absolutely nuts over this!She can smell the roast beef flavor from another room.I originally bought this as a healthy alternative to rawhides for my dogs teeth.But after reading the ingredients, there is really nothing healthy about it.It's nice the product is fortified with vitamins, but not so nice when it's full of grains and fillers as the base ingredients.I went with Sam's Yam's Sweet Potato Raw Hides, as they are truly ""natural"".But for those who are feeding low-grain or no-grain dog food, this should be ok as a once-in-a-while treat.But if your dog is on a more generic dog food, then there is absolutely no place for even more grains in their treats."
5,Very special treats,"Boy our dogs go crazy for these treats, I buy the regular sized ones and cut them into thirds, they are easy to cut and our dogs are small Yorkies so the third portion is perfect for a treat. They are good for their teeth too. We have one 12 year old and her teeth are perfect. They are one of our dogs favorite treats that we buy. Your dog will love the flavor and they are made in the USA. Can't beat that, just wish they were a bit cheaper."
2,Not for hardcore chewers,"I bought this product for my 9 month-old, 30lb puggle. She is a crazy chewer so I figured it would keep her busy for at least a few hours.After 5 minutes, she had chewed a few tiny chunks off of one end. After 10 minutes, maybe half an inch max was missing from the same end.After 15 minutes, 90% of the bone was gone. I don't know what happened but she must have figured out a way around the chewing. For the next 24 hours she was obviously in discomfort as her body passed the chew, and she drove us crazy acting out because of it.This product is nothing more than a really expensive dog biscuit. DO NOT BUY if your dog is an intense chewer. Light chewers may be able to make it last, but honestly I wouldn't risk your dog's health. Stick to original nylabones."
4,Quick Disappearing Bone,"My dog chewed it up & made it disappear in about 5 minutes, while I was emptying the box. He definitely likes it but its a little costly to go so fast."
2,doesn't last very long,"As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile. I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist). It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess. If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster. So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product. It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it."
1,Not recommended,"I do NOT recommend these. My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes. It is a very expensive treat and I'm just hoping we don't have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the Edible Nylabone. I will never buy these again!!!"
1,If you love your pet don't buy!,"Fed to dog and she got violently sick and vomited the whole this up after eating it. Don't buy this product if you love your pet!!Nylabone Healthy Edibles Bone, Roast Beef Flavored with Vitamins, Regular Size, Triple Pack"
4,My dog loves it...,"... but it's gone in 60 seconds :-). Considering the cost of the bone and how fast it disappears I will only be buying intermittently,"
1,$7.99 gone in less than 7 minutes,"I paid $7.99 for the colossal sized one I got my Great Pyrenees puppy. In less than 7 minutes she had eaten the entire thing. I cannot afford to entertain my dog for more than $1 a minute. She loved it, but I will not purchase this product again. My girl is actually very gentle with her toys too. At 11 months old, she has yet to destroy a single one of her stuffed toys. If it's an edible chew toy though, I've found nothing that can stand up to her jaws."
2,JUST ANOTHER DOG TREAT,This bone is nothing more than a big dog treat. I have a 2 yr old Pit who ate through the souper in 5 minutes. After reading other reviews I took it away from him and will save the rest for a later date. I was hoping for a bone that would last a little bit longer as a chew toy and not just be eaten like a treat. Will not be buying this again.
4,Interesting take on the audiotext industry,Almost didn't buy the book after reading the bad review written by another PSO but decided to take a chance. It was pretty good and insightful for anyone that has no idea how the modern phone sex industry works.
2,IT DOES LIVE UP TO ITS TITLE,"Phone Sex Diary is exactly what it is. I too read it within a couple hours. There were a few spelling mistakes as another reviewer mentioned, but you still knew what she meant.I too am a phone sex operator/owner and in the process of writing my own book. Even though I plan on describing how I got into the business and why, as she did (although I won't take up the entire book telling you this) I will take it further and explore many of my calls/callers and go in depth with each one. Also my feelings at the time of the call, this is all part of phone sex and its ashame that Cassandra didn't share some of her conversations with her clients to her readers. If you're looking for a story, and just that a story about a young girl's road to being a pso, then this book is for you. I too feel I could have spent the $19.95 on something better."
1,USELESS.....,"There was absolutely nothing contained in this book that was even interesting! No in depth information at all...a novice could have taken a better shot at writing a book about the life as a PSO! Don't waste your money...you can have my copy for free...a TOTAL WASTE OF my hard earned CASH, coming from my life as a PSO! BORING BOOK...had it read in an hour!! If you have any imagination or creativity at all, you do not need a book to teach you how to do phone sex. Did I mention all of the grammatical errors? I would like to know who proofread or edited this book....you should be ashamed!"
2,It looks cool... but that's about it.,"I purchased this product with the hopes of getting better reception from my stereo receiver. I currently had a ""rabbit ears"" antenna and didn't like the look. I thought this would not only look good, but would also provide excellent reception. When I hooked up the antenna I immediately lost reception of my favorite channel. I tried many different antenna positions and various amplification settings and still nothing.The verdict: The ""rabbit ears"" are back and so is my channel."
2,poor reception,The Terk AM/FM Amplified Stereo Antenna with Gamma Loop may work in some places but it didn't work up state AZ in the mountians. It pulled in only those stations I could get before I plugged in the Terk. Sorry. I have since sold it.
5,Inspiring!,This book should be highly recommended to doctoral candidates as they begin their adventure- it approaches the journey as a reasonable and woth-while effort.
4,LoverGirl Teena,"I love this collection. I play this often and it never gets old or tired. Teena was one of the few real artist who could write and produce her own songs. Too bad she was always underrated. While I love this collection as some reviews have pointed out, alot of great songs are missing (Ooo La La La?) but its still good and if you love real music buy this.My Faves1. Square Biz2. Behind The Groove3. Portuguese Love4. LovergirlR.I.P Teena"
5,Teena Marie: Ultimate Collection,"I will always love her, music is just timeless. I have not bought her new cd as I'm truly an old school type of girl, but I'm sure it is a hit and I will try and listen to a few snippets and see if she still has it."
4,Teena Marie: Ultimate Collection,"I have been a Teena Marie fan since a kid; growing up in 80s how can you not be? A white girl with s soul sounding voice! This CD is awesome and has the best of her best in my opinion. Great tracks like; Portuguese Love, Fire and Desire, I want to be your lover girl, all these and the rest of the songs bring back great memories of growing up in the 80s. A great buy!"
1,Missing & incomplete tracks,"Buyer beware. I just purchased this item from an outlet other than Amazon.com, and several of the tracks on this compilation are not full versions. Instead, they are ""radio edits."" Unfortunately, there is nothing on the packaging that indicates that several of the tracks (including ""Square Biz""; ""Behind the Groove""; and ""Fire and Desire"") are truncated. (There is a full version of ""Portuguese Love,"" however.)I agree with others who claim this CD set fails to include several key tracks. The track listing, however, is something you can check before you buy the item. In contrast, there is no way to know whether a CD includes ""radio edits"" until you actually purchase the item (or get the item used and check the insert before paying). This is major and common failing of too many compilations, and the primary reason why it is worth buying the complete album whenever it is available."
4,Not the Ultimate But Good,"Lady T is All Of that.She&The King Of Punk Funk Rick James are Touring Again I Can't Wait for that.Teena Learned all Her Craft from Rick&Ran with it.As A Writer,Arranger,Producer,Musician&Vocalist Lady T. is One of the All-TIme Greats.But this Set is Missing Motown&Epic Material.Still Nevertheless it's Worth Having.Her Genius Needs Too Be Known.She is Way Underrated."
4,Most Enjoyable,"I enjoy the soulful sounds of Teena Marie. Anyone that enjoys R&B, would difinitely appreciate this CD."
4,"Good compilation, but short-changed on ""Square Biz""","I bought this CD mainly for my 3 favorite Teena Marie songs, ""Square Biz"", ""Just a Little Lovin'"" and ""Portuguese Love"". I was a little disappointed to find that Square Biz is a shortened version, missing my very fav Teena lyric ""I'm gonna hip you to the T...The T?...What's the T?...Well you know that's me..."" All in all, though, not a bad compilation of her songs."
1,"shallow, desultory and thoroughly offensive","Mrs. Howell acheives a blend of narcissism, buzz-saw word spirituality and general dissipation only found in small publisher poetry."
4,Tight fit for Panasonic TZ3,The Lowepro Rezo 30 is a tight fit for the TZ3. I do a lot of action photography so it is a little tight to replace the camera between shots but it is compact and tidy for casual shooting. The material is high quality and seems like it will wear well. The zippers work well.
4,Krups blender jar,Works fine and saved me from adding to the land fil by throwing away the whole machine (:-)))
5,Good Classic Book on the Subject,Very nice presentation on the subject. Enjoyable to read and easy to follow. Desciptions are concise and too the point. Book assumes reader has some background on modern control theory.
4,Lots of good pointers,"This is an easy to read book with lots of good pointers for success at duplicate bridge. It does NOT include much in depth analysis or large numbers of example hands. It is mostly rules of thumb and anecdotes. I would have preferred a bit more content, but what was there was excellent.I recommend it for beginning to intermediate duplicate players."
1,"Trillville, Lil- Scrappy and lil-jon are ridiculous","this cd is horrible! Trillville, lil-scrappy, and lil jon have no talent except for lil jons djing skills. I would never recommend this cd or any from these guys in particular lil scrappy. Trillville, lil-scrapy, and lil jon could neva eva get on my level."
1,"I wish I ""neva eva"" got this CD","I'll rate this CD 1 1/2 stars, because I like it somewhat, but I don't take Trillville or Lil' Scrappy seriously. One day, I had a chance to get a CD, and I couldn't decide what to get, so I got this CD. I thought I'd like it, because I liked the song ""Neva Eva"". It turns out this CD sucks. The chrouses are nothing but a bunch of inane phrases being shouted out. It's more pathetic than Lil' Jon's Kings of Crunk. At least that CD featured good rappers. If you're a fan of Trillville, I'd recommend J-Kwon, T.I., or Petey Pablo. I like the last three rappers I mentioned because they actually have creativity unlike Trillville and Lil' Crappy. If you want to hear some real hip hop, check out Eminem, Dr. Dre, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Obie Trice, Royce Da 5'9"", 50 Cent, etc."
5,YES!!!!,"This is what all current young rappers should use as a role model. With club-hoppin' as popular as ever, Trillville inserts a hardcore message into all of these bangers, and the result is a disk full of rap anthems for today's listeners.The best song is ""Get Some Crunk In Your System"". There's no complicated message here, they're just telling you to get hyped for the music. It's a great song to listen to on your way to work, too. The next-best song is ""F.I.L.A."", and both of these songs are meant to bump. This is why subwoofers were invented. Get ready to go deaf.I only dislike the radio song, ""Somecut"". It's sappy garbage that's boring. Thank God that the very next song is an absolute banger.Other than ""Somecut"", you could pick any track from this album and bump it through your subwoofers. I think this album is a classic. Every single track is hot."

1,Cloned!,"The lead-off story in this collection, ""Articles of Faith,"" is a wonder. But each subsequent story is a clone, following the same pattern, which becomes so familiar that the reader could write the stories herself. The theme for each story is: the thorn causing the characters' unhappiness is the very cause of enlightenment, and it brings peace in the end. Changing character's circumstances and characteristics doesn't change the story; therefore, they are all much too predictable."
2,"Somewhat fun, but not very well made","Jimmy Wang Yu stars as a famous executioner who is about to make his 1000th beheading. Chin Siu Ho plays his disciple and from there it gets really weird. I think every single prson who dies in this movie comes back to life. There are a lot of special effects, sometimes fun ones. The worst part of this movie is that there are no good fight scenes and the acting is horrible. chin Siu Ho shows some real talent, but he can't carry the movie by himself.2/5Picture and sound quality on the Image DVD is good."
1,Whoops,Was not the movie I was looking for. Didn't much care for the film. I found it slow and the martial arts were a let down.
2,A lame effort from a usually-good writer.,"John Barnes has written some first class books. This isn't one of them. First, it's full of inconsistencies. Do people's minds travel among parallel universes, or their bodies? The answer: both, with no reason given for why it's sometimes one and sometimes the other. Second, the basic plot is mostly hackneyed. The one original twist is a heavyhanded allusion to TV channel-surfing that isn't enough to sustain a novel. It might have worked for a short story. Perhaps that's what this book is: a short story stretched into a short novel. Anyway, I left it feeling cheated, an experience I have never had with a Barnes book before."
3,More than just a little weird.,"This is one of those books that just doesn't seem to be the right length. Some of the concepts would make great short stories, but stuffing everything into about 300 pages left a number of spots that either needed to be expanded on or left out.While I can't say that I want my six bucks back, I also can't really feel comfortable telling all my friends that they should run out and buy this book. I can say that if you haven't read some of Mr. Barnes' other books, this is probably not the best one to start with."
4,Possibly the best multi-worlds story I've encountered,"I've only started reading John Barnes' books lately, but this one really caught my interest. There have been a number of attempts to write a multi-worlds story that made sense, but most of them were either drowned in pointless hard-sf jargon or almost without any science whatsoever. The ending is a little unsatisfying, but does go okay with some of the character's standpoints. It was a story that kept my interest the whole way."
1,Limp,"This is an amibitious attempt at a parallel worlds story. In the narrator's worldline, the Germans won WWII though other clues reveal earlier discrepancies between this worldline and ours. The plot features a breakdown of worldlines with individuals jumping from one to another. This idea is not new, indeed its the central feature of one of the oldest and still one of the best works on parallel universes, Murray Leinster's Sideways in Time. In this book, the engine of worldline jumping turns out to be quantum computing, an idea used previously by Robert Sawyer. Beyond the lack of originality, Finity does not have well fleshed out alternative worldlines, particularly good character development, or a compelling plot."
3,Good story without an ending,"Good read, bad ending. The beginning was very well done and had me hooked before I knew it. Looked forward to see how it would resolve. Unfortunately, the ending never resolved anything, except to end the book. Seemed like the ending was rushed, put the book down with a feeling of disappointment."
3,"A good book, but ends up short","The overall book was good, the plot was good, but the ending sort of let down. The hero hops through thousands of alternate universes to find his girlfriend, brings dead cat back to life thanks to even more universe hopping, and then settles down in the middle of nowhere, staying away from things that may cause him to change universes. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew goes on to travel, etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked this book, except for the ending.The idea is good, the background history is amazing, but there is a lot of useless information. Why do we need to know that the Germans have orbital colonies around the equator? That never comes in handy? If John Barnes had taken the time to do the ending right and clarify a few things, this would have been a 5 star book."
2,Great work- if it had been finished,"The first thought I had after closing the book was that it was a great work- Well, would have been, if it had been finished. The ending was the worst I've read in a long while. It wasnt really an ending, it was more of a stopping. Not to mention the whole thing was a stretch of imagination. Tolkien wove more believeable tales than this. In the end, I felt that the two dollars I paid for it at the Dollar General store was a buck and two bits too much."
2,"A brilliant writer takes a dive with ""Nazi's in Space""","I've been a big fan of John Barnes after reading his wonderful novel ""Mother of Storms."" He has a wonderful knack for adding special elements that kept the reader interested, as well as establishing believable characters and well woven plots. His collection of short stories, ""Apostophes & Apocalypses"" (Dec 98) was also superb.So what happened? This novel contains one of the most overworked themes, chopped up storylines and only glimpses of his usual brilliance. Maybe it could be hacked together as a ""Nazi's in Space"" b-grade movie for Hollywood--but even that would take some doing.If you are a die-hard Barnes fan, you may find some satisfaction here. I'm sorry to say that I didn't."
2,Clone of another book -,"This book, which looks interesting on the outside, becomes a different animal once you start into it. This one involves multi-universes, existing (? ) simultaneously and our ability to jump from one to the other. In plot it is reminescent of the TV show, SLIDERS, but in style and text it is a clone of The Man In the High Castle by Philip K Dick - but without that author's flair.As usual we are given his fascination with both nazis and communists (communist victory is a common thread in more that one of his books). The story grows slightly confusing and the ending is obviously botched (endless possiblities?) but for a diversion it will do. As other reviewers have noted, it suffers by lacking a historical setting as a base. All worlds are alien and different. Please read The Man In The High Castle for an excellent treatment of this subject."
1,confusing...unsatisfying,"This was one of the most confusing books I've ever read. Now don't get me wrong; I love books with plots and suspense and foreshadowing and all of that good stuff. I guess the problem I have with this one is that the plot and the ending aren't ""worth"" all the confusion in the first 3/4 of the book. While I admire the author for not falling back on a perfect little ""happy ever after"" ending, the ending he does give just isn't satisfying.Actually, the style of this book reminds me a lot of the movie ""Twelve Monkeys."" If you don't adore twisted mind benders in your SF, don't bother with this book."
2,"Not as Lame as ""Mother of Storms""","This is only the second book by Barnes that I've read, and as was the case with the first one, Mother of Storms, I enjoyed his writing when he was dealing with the science, but found it very lacking in everything else. While the characters were better developed in Finity, they were still not very compelling, and I had very little sympathy for any of them. Also, it's a pretty predictable book, and the while the science of alternate/parallel universes was well done, it's hardly a brand new idea.I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, except maybe just to pass a couple of hours on an airplane, without having to pay too much attention to what you're reading."
4,Bob Schneider is a genius!,"First off, tracks 1 and 5, Blue Skies for Everyone and Round and Round, respectively, are by folky popster Bob Schneider, NOT Lonely Land!!!And these tracks make the album worth every cent! Like Tom Waits mixed with Paul Simon, only cheerier, Bob Schneider's melodies and quirky lyrics are beyond infectious. Who can resist something so fresh as a little opera singing layered with poprock on Round and Round?!Also, Sandra Bullock's mom sings opera on the last track...cool."
5,must have for safety,"I bought this for my cat. It's the safest and most comfortable way to take you pet for a walk or any where. I use it to take my cats to the vet. They feel safe while being able to see what's going on around them. Also way easier on me, my guys are no light weights to be lugging around. I wouldn't be without it. It stears so easy and folds up when not in use. You won't be sorry for purchasing this."
2,The two zippers break,"The stroller itself is fantastic but the two zippers that close in your pet are made of very low quality plastic. The zipper tracks are wavy, thus causing the zippers to get stuck, then eventually they will break off."
5,Outward Hound Pet Stroller,"My cat and I both love this pet stroller. For his viewing pleasure there is see through mesh on three sides; for my viewing pleasure there is a mesh top so I can see him at all times. We have put many miles on this pet stroller and enjoyed our jaunts together throughout the neighborhood and downtown, including going into stores since he's totally contained. Love it!!!"
5,The perfect solution!,"My Yorkie recently suffered a spinal stroke and wasn't allowed to walk for several weeks to allow the spine to heal. I used the stroller in the house to keep him with me at all times, and he loved being able to go on walks with me. It is so easy to push, and stores nicely. It's very well made, and perfect for a small dog!"
3,More info in description please,"size is indicated as ""LARGE"" While other strollers would provide dimensions. As a result I can not make a buying decision with info provided."
3,Outward bound stroller,"Dear SellerWhile i love the outward hound stroller the ""hood"" part of the stroller doesn't open.The box arrived with tape across the top- clearly had been opened. We set it up and then found the carriage hood would not open. I am afraid to force it as it looks like it would break it.Wondering if a mistake was made and someone returned this box and it as sent to me.I don't want to return it because of the cost involved but this item seems to have arrived broken or defective.Please advise- i am disappointed."
2,Buy The Life and Times of Steve Marriott Instead,"Everything on this DVD is available on ASIN B00004Y57A. The only difference is that the footage on that one is punctuated with the faces of aging rockers giving interviews, and perhaps a little truncated. Despite those aesthetic blemishes, however, the Life and Times of Steve Marriot is just a better product.Incidentally, if you *must* purchase this, one of the cool things about it is the DVD jukebox feature, which is 10 videos from Leon Russell, Jack Bruce, Procol Harum, etc. That may be worth the price of this DVD alone - however, most of the footage is from the later years. And in any case, the full Leon Russell DVD is a better purchase anyway."
1,SITTIN' DOWN TO A TINY SLICE OF PIE WITH A LARGE SIDE OF ADS!,"Ain't much Pie on this plate.What little crust there is (four songs) all appear on the ""Life & Times Of Steve Marriott"" DVD.However, there are a TON of advertisements (33!) for other titles.It's even possible that the disc space allotted to the ads may exceed that allocated to the small piece of Pie footage.The producers of this disc should have concentrated on baking more Pie, instead of trying to peddle their other wares.There is nothing here to whet your Humble appetite, because this sliver of Pie has virtually no filling.Thanks for reading my review.. It's been pun!"
5,Two hidden diamonds,"These are two of Anne Murray's best albums, with divine ballads, hearty rockers, country rambles and some real grit. Brother Bruce joins her on ""Player in the Band"" and ""Dancin' All Night Long"" is one of the truly memorable Murray ventures. These are albums which stand the tests both of time and listening again and again. They're fresh and sassy--don't miss 'em."
5,Key Largo Guitar,"It came in the mail quickly, about 4 days, in prefect shape and it is fairly easy to play, the sound is good, and it is beautiful."
2,Good Collections Poor Quality,"If you are die-hard collector of 12inch versions,it's worth to buy.Especially for ""Prove Your Love""by Taylor Dayne and ""Stimulation""by Wa Wa Nee.But,these tracks are not from original master tapes.They are from old used vinyls.So,there are scratch noises all through the entire tracks.Moreover,some of them are not 12inch mixes.Because,extended versions of ""Got To Be Real""or""Play That Funky Music"" are not exists.If you want ""Boom Boom""or""Jackie""or ""It's Raining Men"",you'd better find other CDs with better qualities.You will be disappointed."
5,LOVED IT!,Very happy with this item. It was exactly what I was expecting!!! Very detailed and a few extras with it as well!!
4,Good Single,"This single is really more then the average single. It has five tracks total (Push it, Push it (remix), Push it (diff remix), Bled for Days (live), and Down (non-album song). The two remixes are pretty good, although i think the first is the better of the two. Bled for days live is alright, and Down, which is really a demo and not a new song, is awesome. They also have push it and a live recording of bled for days videos for your comp encoded in the cd. All in all, a must have for static-x fans. Static-X has a new song on the ""Negativity in Black 2: A tribute to black sabbath"" album. Make sure to check that out. peace."
3,What happened to the good remixes!,"I love the song ""push it"" but the remixes are not that great if great at all. The unrealeased track sounds a lot like push it, but its all good. ""Bled for days"" live, whats up with that its the same as the original version except there are stupid people claping and screaming yeah yeah yeah... Well This single is not that expensive and it was mostly good so go out and buy this baby. Oh this also has the video to ""push it""."
4,does not fit Lotus Esprit,"listed by some users as a cross reference, it rotates in the wrong direction to be used on Esprit"
2,New design is NOT durable.,"It works ok as a pet door. If you had a very slow feeble dog it might last longer. Any wind over ~10mph will hold the door open as the magnetic latch will not reliably catch after a pet goes through.I have purchased three, the last one of these doors just gave up, after about 10 months use by our four dogs. The first one that we purchased was several (about 7 years) ago. It lasted nearly five years with continuous heavy use by three very active terriers. The hinge pivots finally wore out and let the door jam against the frame. I noticed that the replacement (same staywell model) was much lighter and of different design. The new design lasts about 6 to 10 months. If this was a $15 product, this would be acceptable, at $40 to $50 it is not.Find different manufacturer."
4,"Paul Revere & the Raiders, Goin' to Memphis","Often called one of America's forgotten groups, Mark Lindsay and company stretched their range on this album and perfectly blended the Raider's style with Blue-eyed soul. Peace of Mind, the only hit off the album, was actually an ad on to the Memphis sessions. If you like seeing how your favorite groups can do something a little different, try this one; a real tribute to Mark Lindsay's vocal and song writing talent."
3,a soul salute that's ok.,"This one was a soul salute cd and the band (studio musicians probably here) really needed to be heading in a more rock direction and this wasn't it. It's a decent cd though if you like sixties soul which is great stuff and the versions here are decent enough. But this didn't help the bands career at all at the time, it's ok though and i like it but casual fans looking for sixties rock and pop should grab other raiders cd's first."
5,This seed is a tree.,"This is not a promising ""beginnings"" album that points at better things to come.This is a very strong album with no filler.No song is weak. Any Townes fan should be happy with this CD."
5,Want to know what a legend sounds like? Get this CD.,"Words can't do justice. Townes Van Zandt was a genius. If you are looking for something that is a little Bob Dylan, a little Hank Willams SR and a lot of gorgeous music to listen to by the campfire, on a road trip, at a party with music lovers then get this. Once you discover TVZ, you'll want all of his stuff. Rest in peace, Townes. As Steve Earle put it, ""TOWNES VAN ZANDT is the best songwriter in the whole world, and I'll stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that.""I am a huge Dylan fan, and when I first discovered TVZ I thought there was no way, but I think Earle is right. Don't tell my Dylan friends though. ;)"
5,Townes' Best Studio Work...,"In the beginning, from the start this should have been Townes Van Zandt's first album... after hearing all of his studio albums in the troubadour box-set, most of the recordings were over-produced, overdone & torturing the natural sound of Townes and his mesmerizing songs... here this disc possesses a different story to tell, the way it should've been. The recording is short, to the point, the ten songs are strong TVZ originals, the singer/songwriter is in top form, and the audio is ferocious... other than this compilation Townes Van Zandt's live stuff is his best, recommended studio albums, - ""Delta Mama Blues"", ""Townes Van Zandt""."
2,Not recommended,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
1,THESE BATS ARE JUNK!!!!!!!,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. As another reported, AA batteries are too big and do NOT FIT into many devices correctly. 3rd or 4th time I used the charger that came with the batteries it significantly overheated and I believe would have caused a fire. I threw the whole mess in the garbage where it belongs. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK OR ASSOCIATED CHARGING DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,horrrible batteries,"The batteries were not what I expected. Some were already dead. They only last 1 hour after recharging. Acid leaks, weak and should be replaced. I did not want to pay again for shipping and handling. Refund, refund, -- do not recommend ordering."
3,Worked Great... for a while,"I've been using these for almost a year now. I've replaced the AAs in almost everything with these. Remotes, flashlights, GPS, etc. Wish I had more and will probably buy another box. They all seem to charge just fine and last fairly long. Brandname alkalines would probably outlast these in most devices, but they're cheaper than an alkaline and can be recharged numerous times. I use an old Rayovac charger that handles NiMH, NiCd, and rechargeable alkaline. Slow charging (~12-hours) is always going to give better results than fast charging (1-8 hrs).Edit Jan 2013: The first batch of these batteries had a thin blue label at the top and worked well but consistently lost capacity and made it about 3 years. The next batch I bought had a wider blue stripe on the label at the top and barely lasted a year before they all quickly lost capacity and became useless."
4,Blish at his best.,"This is an expanded version of a short story that didn't tie into any of Blish's other fiction originally. As with the other short story that became an expanded work, Surface Tension, he kind of 'cannibalises' from his writings the way the French composer Berlioz used his earliest music as the basis for greater and more developed musical works.Oh, and Blish was a music critic on the side, so he probably would've dug being compared to Berlioz."
2,True fans- Skip this DVD,"This DVD is nothing more than drunken, overly aggressive, ignorant fans at concerts. These people are the reason that concerts aren't as enjoyable any more. As for the ""Host"" of this disaster, this guy needs a razor and a shower. The shots of James drunk outside of a club were just unneccesary in light of his new sobriety. You can tell that this was an ""unauthorized"" biography, if it could be called that. The scenes with the host ""interviewing"" a couple of fans looks so staged it is pathetic. I have been a fan of the band since '86 and own every DVD Metallica has put out. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because it IS about Metallica, and that is the ONLY reason. True fans should skip this and stick to the authorized DVD's the band puts out."
2,leave this one on the shelf,"I got this from a discount store, very cheap (less than what it costs with shipping and handling online here), and I really wish I had the money back. It is a underground documentary that that is supposed to be focused on the fans of metallica, trying to be heavy metal parking lot. However, this is a far cry from it. The folks this movie shows are either tweeking on meth or too drunk to carry on a meaningful conversation. After the first two interviews with drunk people, the novelty wears off, and there is no funny left. Sure there are a few appearences by big stars such as Rob Halford, but not really worth puchasing this disc for. There is no insight, nor redeaming quality this movie. It is almost insulting to Metallica and their fans, and me being a fan, I wish they would have had a bigger cross section interviewed to show how broad the fanbase is, and how productive and insightful we can be. Let this movie sit on the shelf."
3,What makes the Divine Monroe an ICON?,"I am a high school student, trying to write my term paper on one of the most influential women in Amercan history. What it is that this book lacks, is the ""stuff"" that made her an icon. It goes into her early years and helps the reader to figure out who Norma Jean (a.k.a. Marilyn Monroe) really was. I hope that anyone who buys this book realize's that it won't be of any help to them, if they are trying to prove how she got to be an American icon, and what it was she did to get there! I only gave it 3 stars, because it has some great pictures of Marilyn."
5,awesome,This is a wonderful movie.... highly recommended. It is not widely known that many and diverse people were them victims of Nazi horrors. This film focuses upon a family of Christians who help Jewish neighbors escape and are themselves imprisoned.
5,Loads of fun!,"I bought this for my daughter since I loved the old model myself, as a child. It is so cool!! i think I played with it more on CHristmas morning than she did!!---although she really loves it too!"
4,Way OVER priced!,This price of this is totally ridiculous. I too used to have one back in the day and as much as I would like to have one. I WILL NOT pay this price!BTW: I only rated it because it would not let me proceed without doing so. It's based on what I remember about my old one.
3,Takes up a lot of space!!!!,"I found this to be a very heavy car seat. The stroller is very wide and requires two hands to pull out of my trunk. When using the ""easy 1 handed fold-up"" I find it still requires two hands. One hand to push the button, and the other to fold it, as it is not spring loaded. This stroller takes up my entire trunk and I have a large SUV. Also the car seat is so long that I can only use it in the center seat to allow it to go past where the front seats lie. However, the stroller does drive smoothly."
1,Worthless as a keyboard,"Thanfuly, Ididnt haveto pay 40 bucks fortithing,I fund in sale fo eigt. Tre, itdoes roll up and the bxclms oucan evn tye n shaow water. Big ea! It only wokf ou're illing o tye very slowl wit ne fingr. ne sar since o cn roll it pand iyu, but tally worthle s a cuer kyba.Thankfully, I didn't have to pay 40 bucks for this thing, I found it on sale for eight. True, it does roll up and the box claims you can even type in shallow water. Big deal! It only works if you're willing to type very slowly with one finger. One star, since you can roll it up and take it with you, but totally worthless as a computer keyboard.NOTE: Both paragraphs say the exact same thing. The first was typed using the Flexible Full Sized Keyboard. The second was done using the keyboard on my laptop. Any questions?"
4,good keyboard,"This is a good keyboard but it requires some learning curve before you become productive. Two things to note:1. the backspace key is a square instead of a rectangle. If you're used to the plastic keyboard, you will almost always miss the backspace key and end up hitting '\'.2. hitting the corners of the keypad doesn't register. Instead, you need to hit the keypad near the center. if you're a lazy or inaccurate typist, you'll be frustrated. This is especially true with the Shift key-- pressing the corners of the shift key isn't good enough.That said, the keyboard makes no sound and is very easy to clean unlike plastic keyboards where dust/dirt gets in-between the keypads."
2,An ok product.. could use some work,"I just recently purchased this keyboard. It is an ok product but could use some work. It is hard to type with and you have to press down hard on some of the keys in order for the letters to show up. I have found my typing speed to dramatically decline with it. It's a lot easier to type if you just use your index fingers with it instead of the proper way.. haha. I wouldn't recommend it for long-term use or permanent use, but it certainly comes in handy for my laptop on the go.. especially since my laptop keyboard does not work any longer."
4,For experienced typists,"Some may complain that it's too difficult to type with this keyboard, but it really just takes some getting used to. This isn't just some keyboard one gets to learn to type on-- this is a keyboard for someone who knows how to type and can deal with learning something a little different. I am typing on this keyboard right now and I am having no trouble typing what I want to.This keyboard is flexible, durable, and in my opinion kind of fun to type on."
1,Too many misfire.,"Especially the keys in the num pad. When I press ""7"", it fires both ""7"" and ""Num Lock"". When I press ""6"", it fires both ""5"" and ""6"". There are a few more...it's unpredictable, hard to type in password. The typing experience is bad...I recommend geting the Kensington washable instead."
2,Incredibly Difficult to Type On,"I bought this for the PC in my kitchen because I though it would be easy to clean. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to type on. One has to press each key in the exact center and sometimes repeatedly to get the characters to appear on the screen. Very irritating. I've since removed it, thrown it away, and replaced it the the original keyboard that came with the PC."
3,Neewer Portable Flexible Keyboard,I find it easy to take with me if I need it. But the typing with it can be an issue and alot more difficulty in pressing the key's as it takes great effort with finger pressing to get the key's to register what you are typing unlike what my other keyboards allow me to do more quickly and easily. Not as big keyed and easy to type with. But good for if in bind and out and about and have to use it. I am keeping it for back up if ever needed. It does work just with extra effort in the fingering of the keys.
2,"Excellent Product, but died a few months latter.","When I first received the package, it had been damaged in shipping.I contacted the manufacturer via amazon.They quickly sent out a replacement.I received it and am very happy with it.I will be keeping this product in mind when I need to get another keyboard.-- Edit --A short time after getting the replacement, I had it die also.These keyboards are NOT spill resistant and do NOT handle being rolled up to be carried."
1,Horrible,"I did not like the keyboard at all. The q w e keys did not work, and the e key is one of the most used keys. I would not suggest getting this keyboard."
1,Worked well the first time,"I used this once and it seemed to work as well as a flexible keyboard would be expected to work. The second time I went on travel and tried to use it some of the keys would not work. I pressed in the area where the wire enters the keyboard which caused some keys to work and others not to work so there must be a bad connection there.Claims to be ""Virtually Indestructible"", maybe this is true for spills but be very gentle and don't travel with this keyboard and expect it to be reliable!"
3,not functional,if your shopping for a very quiet keyboard then this is what you want. But you have to press hard for the keys to work and we finally have up after about two weeks and went back to the loud old one.
2,What?,"Maybe my mind is too cluttered or I am lacking a certain ""zen' quality, but I don't find this book very useful at all. There are 81 ""chapters"". Each ""chapter"" contains an oriental pen and ink picture and one page of text. If you're looking for real content, you won't find it here."
5,Life-long process,"Leadership is not something you are born with. Nor something you buy in the local deli. It is a life-long process of ever changing, growing, empowering others. And in the end - the best leaders are those, people around them will say ""We did it ourselves."" If you are ready to develop yourself into being such a leader - this is the right book for you. But be worn and remember - it will take you years to develop this unique capacity. The good thing, though, is that each and every one of us has this capacity within us. Good luck! Ronen Ben-Naphtali (Israel)"
1,Either/or,"Coffiin is caught up in a world of false dichotomies. Everything is war or peace, love or hate, atheism or fundamentalism. And yes, I do think atheism is his alternative. As much as he talks about God, it is clear that the God of his belief has very little substance. I've heard pastors talk like this of ethical niceties, but when you really question them about whether or not Jesus was God, they offer little more than a shrug. This book is a distracting fantasy."
1,Say what?,"I have to say I don't really get it. I picked up a book expecting just that, a ""Credo,"" which is a statement of faith and belief of some kind. But this could not be further from it. W.S. Coffin doesn't believe in anything. He seems to think that pulpit witticisms constitute doctrine. I can't get a real feel for anything he believes theologically. Instead, he's substituted tepid politics for church talk. If I wanted this, I would read a book by William Clinton instead of William Coffin, and it would probably say the same things."
1,Don't Get It,"I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of this book. Usually after I read a Christian book I either walk away inspired to follow, or challenged to change, or urged to obey, or something like that. I walk away from this book thinking ""Coffin really thought he was clever."" In fact, though, there's not much take home value to the book."
1,Why Try?,"Coffin's collection of (somewhat scattered) thoughts seems to boil down to the basic idea that the world would be a better place if people were gracious to each other. However, one wonders, if God is such a small part of the picture all along, what is the reason why people ought to be gracious? He seems to pull the carpet out from under his own feet. Why should people honor one another if God is just a farce that we have put on to soothe our consciences?"
3,Just O.K.,"I was rather disappointed by this book. :( The plot it's self was pretty exciting, and so was most of the book. But I was expecting something a little more exciting for the ending. For example, Colton's ""secret"" was BORING! Also, I think it wasn't very pratical, interesting, OR excting how Mr. Turnbull, just up and decided to be cheerful. Something should have happened and showed how Ms. Keech changed his mind. Also, I don't think it was pracitcal how they convinced Ms. Keech to paint Mr. Turnbull so they could sneak in the tunnels. If he was that much of a grouch, why would he let Ms. Keech paint him, and why would Ms. Keech want to!?!?!?Anyways, even though it wasn't a complete and total waste, it wasn't what I expected and you may want to think about wether you have an hour to waste on a ""Just-Okay"" book before you decide to read this."
4,Truth in Advertising - CD is Exactly What It Says It Is,"It's Old School 1990's Trance.It's the Extended Versions.If that's what you're looking for, this CD is 100% truthful and it delivers exactly what it promises."
2,This is NOT a DBA handbook,"This book falls far short of being a DBA handbook. It is more useful to someone who needs to ""get by"" for a few weeks while their DBA is away.It is ok at showing you how to ""do things"" in some cases (hence 2 stars). But, if you need to work backwards (i.e you might want to query dictionary tables to find out where something lives and why) then this book is almost useless. I am an experienced Oracle DBA and decided to write this review after referencing this book 10 times in the past week and not finding any help at all from this book in each case. The index is worse than useless.This books title should have been ""a DBA overview"""
1,"This is not fair, Oracle 8 stuff in an 9i book cover!","Mrs. Theriault, Mr. Loney, the Oracle guys developed a milestone 9i with a lot of new important database features. In your book I can find features of Oracle 8 and 8i. That is not fair. I'm a lucky man, because my company has bought the book! As an Oracle teacher I must order all the new books, but this book I cant't recommend to people who actually have an idea about Oracle 8!"
4,Good reference material,"Good for reference, obviously I would not enjoy to sit andread this book in a setting. But if you want to learn aboutindividual subjects and have a guide book is great."
4,"Good offering, but does not represent.","This CD doesn't really represent what these guys do live, but it has some interesting moments. My complaint is at 42 minutes (plus CD-rom capabilities with video) it's much to short. These guys play 3hour shows with endless upbeat jams, and the tunes here are in the 3-4 minute range and more subdued."
5,The trio that gives 133%,"The album does a good job of reflecting the wide variety of sounds at the live show. Charlie Hunter, Skerik, Stanton Moore, and Mike Dillon each contribute. The bass and guitar are in synch: it's actually one person as Charlie Hunter plays a combination guitar/bass on this album. Skerik brings lots of energy with his horn (which is black and made of metal) and some distorted voice improv. Stanton Moore does the usual terrific job on drums. Mike Dillon adds some great percussion into the mix.There are two versions of the CD: one has the track listing indicated by Amazon, the other has Gat Swamba as the #2 track, Sprung Monkey as #6, and Interpretive Ape Dance as #8. If you hear big drums on track #8, you've got this other version of the CD."
2,Not what I Expected,"I have enjoyed the music of Charlie Hunter, especially ""Right Now Move"", but I'm afraid this one is a bit over my head. The lack of structure and ""noodling"" quality of the solos is irritating enough on first listening that this CD will probably never see number 2. I'm a fairly polytonal kind of guy, an old fan of Capt. Beefheart and Zappa, but this was just grating."
4,Rocks! A lot of fun!,"I picked this up after hearing one song on XM radio. I'm happy I did! Very hip, fun to drive, party and lounge to. A little slow and a little repetitive in parts so no 5 stars, but hey, the rest is really great.The videos to play on your CD-ROM are pretty worthless but the links are cool.It's music you can't feel bad while listening to... and that's a good thing."
4,THIS DVD IS OK,"THIS DVD IS OK, IT IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THEN THE OTHERS BELOW.I HAVE JUST ORDERED A FEW GREEN DAY DVDS AND HAVE JUST WATCHED THE DVD COMBO FROM SWEET CHILDREN TO AMERICAN IDIOTS AND THIS ONE GREEN DAY MUSIC IN REVIEW THE ARE THEY SAME DVD DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. (THOUGH THE DVD BOOK IS GOOD). I HAVE ALSO JUST BEGUN WATCHING GREEN DAY ROCK CASE STUDIES, SAME PEOPLE TALING ABOUT GREEN DAY NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS."
5,Brings back so many memories,I absolutely love Pokemon. Everytime I watch the 1st season on DVD it brings back so many childhood memories going back to when I was 8 years old back in 1998 if you like the show I definitely recommend this DVD set so you can go back to the very beginning to see when Ash ketchum first started on his journey to become a Pokemon master. I give this DVD set 5 stars all the way. Hope you'll love the show as much as I did.
3,Great Shipping,"Shipped very quickly and in great condition! Only concerns were the messed up transactions occurring in my account after the item being shipped. Product was automatically payed for after ordering on here but shortly after (about 2 days) the transcation info disappeared, money was returned into account then a few more days later the transaction came out of my account after the item was confirmed shipped. It was very confusing and made me uneasy that my account information was accessible after the item had been shipped out."
5,pokemon,Nothing was wrong with any of the discs except it didn't come with the box that held them which isn't a big deal to me. It also arrived in a timely manner.
5,Pokemon Indigo League FTW,"Season One of Pokemon is the best season there was. And if you somehow own all the seasons but this one, then you're lost. Get it now. You need Parts 1, 3, and this one Part 2."
5,Great for all Pokemon lovers!,"My son and I are avid watchers of the Pokemon series, and we were thrilled to find out that they were continuing to expand the boxset collections. The Indigo League lays a great foundation for the series and is essential to all Pokemon fans to have! Video and Sound qualities are excellent. A must have!"
4,stunning,"Amano is one of the most interesting artists I've ever stuidied. He fuses traditional Japanese culture, art, and stories with intricate and modern patterns. There's tons of color and each print can be viewed over and over again with different images appearing each time. In other words, this man's art never gets old and he's created a style all his own. Definitely worth purchasing. My only complaint here is that some of the prints were small and it would be better if a few more pages were devoted to single images and not serveral at a time. Downsizing limits detail. However, this is still a beautiful book that can be enjoyed for a long time."
4,AMANO fans only,"The book is well put together and has great image quality, but unless your a big Amano fan than this book is probably not for you. Honestly I wish I could truly give this book 5 stars because I love his ink designs but some of his fairy concepts is not my cup of tea. As for range this book delivers like few art books do and you truly get a feel for his style and what he's about.If you got the change to spend and love art books than this will make a great addition to your collection. Otherwise I would go to a store and flip through it a bit to see if it is for you."
2,Not up to my expectations. . .,"I've seen his work on the Arts channel and am impressed, but when I looked at this book I was disappointed. I hadn't realized he did violent, prurient comic books for adults, and much of this book is devoted to those examples. However, his line and color and the flowing mystic quality are what attract me, but I am turned away by his subject matter."
4,Beautiful Yoshitaka Amano works.,"There are beautiful images of Yoshitaka Amano work, but I wish they were all big images, in the end are thumbnails of images that are not in a bigger size in the book, they are more as a catalog, which is the downside. Nevertheless, is a great book of his works."
3,Great background to modern drug wars,"Great in-depth research on the history of Asian drug dealing, but stops short of covering the post WW II situation. While the authors deny the global conspiracy, at the same time they provide much evidence for drug dealing as part of official policy. In China, Japan, even among Euro corporations profits allow for official corruption. The authors say Yes the CIA was part of Asian drug dealing, but claim it is not a conspiracy? We are at war over drugs, yet allowing our secret police to play a role. The authors should return with a sequel, and re-think the ""no conspiracy"" stance."
4,Great sweat and easy to follow,"I started doing this video two years after the birth of my 2nd child. The moves are easy to follow without a lot of confusing ""dance"" movements. This tape does each move several times so you really start to feel the burn in your lower body. The stretching portion leaves a lot to be desired, but the aerobics are great."
5,As pictured,"My son is a huge fan of the BBC/ICE Cream apparel line. (by Pharrell) On the official site (which we frequent) the shoe line has yet to be offered so we turned to Amazon. This is his 3rd pair of Ice Creams by RBK. The colors are exactly as shown, they fit comfortably and we just ordered another pair."
5,I Kept My Knitting Needles!,"I ordered Elanor Lynn's delightful knitting book as a gift for a friend who is a new Grandma. While wrapping it I read the whole book cover to cover during a summer I was busy downsizing my home and moving into a small apartment. The delicious photos of healthy, happy infants and toddlers, the inviting styles combined with the instructions in the friend to friend voice of Elanor reminded me of the fun I used to have knitting. I moved my needles from the ""give-away"" pile and started a swing coat and hat for a baby a neighbor is expecting. I am so grateful to Elanor for writing this book so that I and others can benefit from her knowledge and creativity. Knitting is such a peaceful activity I tuck in my bag and take with me during the many unexpected moments of waiting. She says knitting can change the world, it certainly change my perception of it!"
5,This was to replace a copy that went missing in the middle of knitting a sweater from it.,The projected arrival was far in the future. And the actual arrival was even beyond the longest projection by WEEKS. I'm hoping the sweator will still fit.
3,A Time Trip,"This CD takes you back to a simpler, more fun time when songs like ""Unknown Girl"", both plaintive and endearing, could be enjoyed just for the artistry of it and ""Kicks"" could still get you moving. While not the top of their CDs, I consider it a valuable addition to my collection."
3,Not bad for poly,"I really like this tie, and I wear it all the time. It has good texture, ties well. It's a quality tie, and I'm surprised that it is polyester."
2,Not great quality,Ok for a kid's room - not the guest room. Think Wal-Mart quality. Would not buy again.
2,Nice but soooo heavy,"These are really nice slipper, but they are the heaviest slipper I have ever tried to wear."
3,Song Collection,"This disc contains many of the Japanese songs heard in the various films and TV seasons of the Space Battleship Yamato franchise (from the first season all the way through to Final Yamato). Note, it does not include any English-language songs. It also does not include anything from the most recent film, Yamato Rebirth.The album will appeal mostly to Japanese fans, but to some hard-core English-speaking fans as well. The reason is that the English adaption of Yamato (called Star Blazers) did not feature songs aside from the opening and closing credits."
2,OMG,"Have read many of Foresters books and really enjoyed them hardly could put them down. However the mentor is not one of her best, its soooo slow and elementary don't think I will finish it. Hope some of her others are not as boring."
4,Mentor,Rebecca Forster has written The Mentor with insite on the legal profession - agree or disagree - with a story thet keeps you guessing. I have enjoyed this and other of her books.
4,Kept me interested,"I enjoyed this book - it started out a little slow, so I had to re-read the first few chapters to make sure I knew exactly what was going on. But I really didn't have the ""who-dun-it"" figured out til the end."
4,Couldn't put it down,Couldn't put it down - I read it months ago & can't actually remember it - but Jonathan Kellerman is always a page turner
3,Bit of a slow start...,"Having enjoyed the Witness Series, gave this one a shot. Was a tad disappointed; very slow start, confusing. Action soon picked up and made for fun and exiting read. Lauren was a little too perfect, and Allen such a super-ego. Will continue to read R. Forster."
5,Forster Scores Again,"Once again Rebecca Forster proves her worth as a top legal thriller writer. As usual Forster not only serves us with the ultimate in unputdownable fiction, she also privileges us with a 'fly-on-wall' perspective of the sometimes weird but always interesting machinations of the legal profession."
1,A very slow page turner!,I think this is a very boring book so far. I don't understand why this book got such a good review. I stopped reading it about half way through the book. Is this her first novel or what?
1,This is not the Cotillard FAIR PLAY.,"I ordered this film thinking it was the FAIR PLAY listed in Marion Cotillard's resume. Up, nope -- it's two Westerns.I found the seller was unresponsive when I attempted to exchange or even ask if the seller had the original film I'd searched for. If you have also had this experience, go to Amazon customer service; they worked very well with me to resolve the situation. But it's not the film with Cotillard."
3,Interesting!,A fascinating take on humanity's 'origins'. It's clear that the author could not dissociate his understanding of present human disposition when forming the idiosyncratic nature of his characters.A good read!
2,I won't bother reading the next book.,Is this really for a youth reader? I never hooked me in. It seemed dull never getting anywhere. Sorry I didn't get it.
4,Great sandals - bad straps - use tape,"Use duct tape to secure the sandals on your boots or shoes. I know, the straps are very poor and they will fray forever once the ends start coming apart. I use duct tape on one of my sandals which has only 1 strap now. The sandals work very good and will aerate your entire yard while giving you a good physical workout."
2,Garden Aerating Sandals,"The Sandals did not perfrom as expected. The strap retaining clips broke during use and I was unable to continue use of them. I have not contacted the seller, but I will.The tool provided did not allow for easy assembly.Because the nuts were of poor quallity it was difficult to tighten properly. I used my own tools and was successful at that point. It took quite some time to fully assemble and the instruction manual provided was of no use.If the clips had been made from metal it would have been the perfect tool for my lawn.I would probably not recommend it for others for purchase."
2,"I love the concept, but...","I thought this was a great idea, and it still could be. Two problems: The straps are too cheap. I've broken two of them by just tugging on them a little too hard while trying to make them tight enough. And the nails need to be tapered. As they are, they quickly fill up with debris as you walk around, making you have to stop and clean them. I think they would self-clean if the nail was a little wider at the top than at the point."
1,Don't bother,"The idea is great, but the product isn't. You need to have very large feet and large work boots to wear these. I have a womens size 10, and they didn't fit well. The straps were as tight as possible and the shoes continued to wiggle loose. To use, I had to pull a foot out of the ground, then push it into another area, working one foot at a time, that is with dry hard soil. With soft soil, it was a challenge to move at all, it felt as if the ground was sucking the shoes into it. Too much effort to use. My shoes will now gather dust."
2,Need improvement,"Lawn aeration shoes are a fine idea, but this model has a critical flaw that needs improvement.The toe strap works fine, but the back strap and heel stop combine to fail to hold the foot in place, and after just a few steps your foot pops out. Tightening the back strap sufficiently to hold is a dangerous idea, because the flimsy plastic sinch will snap.My workaround solution was finding a now disposable pair of shoes, and using liquid nails to bond them permanently to the aerators."
2,Cheap buckles,"I bought this because they looked heavy duty. I spiked about 10 square feet of my yard and the buckles became loose. When I went to tighten, the buckle snapped (very cheap plastic). I did not pay much for these so I guess I can't complain much, you get what you pay for, but I would have hoped they lasted longer than 10 square feet. I was going to buy new metal buckles, but the nylon straps (heavy duty) are sewn & glued around the buckle. If it wasn't for the crappy buckles, I would say good buy for the money. Otherwise they aren't worth it."
5,Great Product,"Spikes a very sharp, which makes it easier to penetrate the soil. The Aerator shoes have a natural feel to them, much better then other aerator products which are not as affective."
1,"Take the money, grab a lighter and burn it","This is the worst waste of money that i have ever spent. Within three minutes on one broken, the other one kept falling off. The first three minutes were great. Do you realize how much walking you would have to do to do a whole yard? It would take days."
1,Broke on my first step taken,Broke on my first step taken. Going to return to get my money back!! I would not suggest this product.
3,Just about OK,All the previous reviews are correct. The straps are too long. But you do not have to yank it so hard that it would break. One can find a way to keep them on without much difficulty. I tested a small portion of my yard and it has given good results. The real test will come this fall when I try the whole yard.
1,spiket shoes,I can't use this item as they will not stay on my feet no matter how hard i try to secure them!
2,Come off your feet too easily,"I've tried using these aerator sandals multiple times, and it is always the same outcome: I'm able to get them fastened securely using the original straps, but after about 10 minutes of pushing my lawn mower around, they start coming off.Up until they come off, the sandals work fine. The sandals are sturdy, and the spikes are able to penetrate into my soil. But being limited to ten minute intervals is a big bummer. I really think a lawn aerating shoe should be just that--an actual shoe or boot you wear, which would prevent the product from slipping off your feet.Bottom line: I would not have purchased this product in the first place had I known how easily they slip off my shoes."
3,Aerating Spikes,"I think the concept for these shoes is amazing. However, the straps just ruin it. They never stay on. You walk about 10 steps and have to continually keep tightening the straps. If these straps had some sort of locking mechanism, I would give them an A+. To keep securing these straps is frustrating and makes the purchase not really worth the effort."
3,Cheap strap otherwise useful product,"As confirmed by other users, the plastic thinggie that holds and retains the strap is indeed cheap and flimsy. Broke as soon as i threaded the strap through. But fear not, i had some old hiking boots and pretty much threaded and wrapped the straps around the boot and staple gunned the straps onto the side of the boots...resulting in Boots +3 vs Earth.:D"
4,jimmy rigg em',"Here is a more accurate review: the aerators alone deserve five stars. The straps however are one star piles of uselessness. That however is easily remedied. Here's what you do, GO BUY NEW STRAPS, found at any camping supply store, and fairly inexpensive."
2,Strap broke on first fitting,"I should have been prepared. I started a paint/epoxy job in the home garage and put these on after I was nearly done. Had I known the strap was going to break THAT easily, I would have been better prepared with Velcro or something, anything!"
1,Flimsy Implementation,"Within 10 minutes, the buckles on both shoes broke. I had to tie the straps around my feet to keep them on. The spikes are high quality, but with such horrible a system to attach them to your feet they really aren't usable."
1,gardenshoes,you can tighten them as much as you want and with the first step they'll come off of your feet
1,Not as robust as you might think...,"I purchased this item because I thought it would be better than making something similar myself...why not let someone else to do right. Well, I did like the plastic shoe design, though I've only used it once...what I didn't like is the cheap plastic buckles. In fact I broke two of them simply cinching them up around my boots and I didn't even put that much tension on them. These shoes would be a reasonable buy if the manufacturer just used a reliable metal buckle....I picked up a set of two for each shoe at my local camping store and they seem to work fine.....go figure. Bottom line....unless you want to change out the buckle....pick a different solution.IV"
2,Aerator Shoes,My only concern with this product is looking like a huge buffoon in my front yard. Anyone had that problem yet?
1,I had to buy velcro to keep it on,I had to buy velcro to keep it on.. Not sure why they wouldnt fix this problem
4,Works Well,It works pretty well. You just have to put them on really tight and be ready to do a lot of walking. I was able to see some real improvement until the drought and the heat set in. Maybe next year I will get the lawn looking even better.
1,Save Your Money!,The shipping cost was ridiculous but the price of the sandals seemed too good to be true...until I tried to assemble them. The directions were not helpful and the lock nuts used to tighten the spikes didn't even fit. The sandals won't fit a normal sized foot.Beware; you get what you pay for!
1,"they broke on 1st use, don't waste your money","I tried these on my lawn. The straps wouldn't stay tight so I kept slipping out of them (I wore boots). Also, the sod was getting stuck in them so I was basically pulling up the turf instead of aerating. After 10-20 feet one of the little nails broke out of them. I tried pulling the straps tighter to keep my shoes from lifting out and the cheap plastic strap keeper broke on one of them.Don't waste your money."
4,Lawn Aerator Sandals,"The item arrived as ordered, and is great considering the low cost of the product. The product is great for small projects/area. I would not recommend for large areas. Be aware of the condition of your soil. Mine have small rocks under the topsiol which caused the spikes to slightly bend."
1,the broken shoe strap!,"the same day I tried themthey broke @ the strap & they are hard to keep on your feet when walking on your lawn, i would buy these again if they were to make them more comfortable & extra durable!"
1,Please Do Not Buy This Product,"As I was putting these shoes on for the first time, the plastic buckle broke. Upon further inspection, I found that the buckles were so flimsy and cheap breaking them is inevitable. Without ever having been used, I tossed these shoes into their proper place. The trash can.The company that is making this garbage knows darn well they are putting out crap. No company who shows such little regard for the hard earned money of their customers deserves to be in business."
1,Green giant spiked aerator shoes,"Great idea, just really hard to use. I did manage to get them on, tried to aerate my lawn, and finally gave up. They did not come with instructions on how to place them on your feet so that they would stay on when the user is stomping around the lawn. And it looks so simple, how could you screw up? Now they just take up space in my garage."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"They do NOT stay on and they are impossible to use. For that reason, I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,Mediocre at best,The base of the shoe and the spikes are very well-built and sturdy. the straps couldn't handle a simple tightening before the buckle snapped. This would be a great shoe if they had better fastener.
1,does not work,"don't Bother this product will not stay on your feet. A Total waste of time, go ahead and it done with the correct tool."
3,HOW TO FIX THE ANKLE STRAP PROBLEM,The back ankle strap needs a lot of torque to keep your heal attached to the spikes. The pathetic cheap plastic buckle is a major design flaw that is probably giving the manufacturer major returned good chargebacks from online retailers. A strong metal buckle may not be enough to provide the torque needed. I cut off the ankle buckles (one had already broken) and slipped both ends of the strap into the racheting mechanism from a couple of tiedowns in my truck. Then the shoes worked great! I balanced myself with a pitch fork in one hand and covered about 750 sq ft in 30 minutes -- a lot faster and easier than if I had to use the pitch fork.
4,"not bad, work as expected","before I bought this shoes, read the other buyers review so I used my own tie-down straps (very tight) with my safety shoes. it seems like a good pair and I walked my 4000 sq. ft yard two three times and the shoes never come out. and sometimes when I walk on a tight clay soil it's a little hard to pull my foot out so I guess if I had used the shoe's strap the tiny thin plastic piece on the strap would break for sure. only one thing that I feel the spikes are not so long, just 2"". with my own strapping system I wish it could be 4"" so punch deep into my clayed yard. but I guess the other spike shoes are all 2"" spike. now I have punched hundreds of 2"" holes in my lawn and hope it works. anyway this is a good spike shoes for the price and the design. but develp your own strapping system like the previous reviewer said."
2,"Good spikes, bad straps","Have used them 4 times and the nylon strap buckle broke. Unless you're wearing Boots, these are extremely uncomfortable to wear as they cut into your skin..."
2,flimsy floppy ankle breakers,"i was so excited to get these spiked aerator shoes so i could toss my worthless two pronged step aerator. however, i will be using that old thing for another year becauce these shoes are horrible.the straps are so flimsy that they can not stay on. with the slightest resistance if the spikes dont come up easily and you have to pull your foot up with any force, the straps immediately come flying off your shoes. So one shoe is stuck in the ground and the other is falling off and well i hope you have medical insurance because you could really break an ankle with these things.even if you are brave enough to try, dont buy them for your dad or hes going to break a wrist in the fall or his hip.Really these are terribly designed and not even worth free."
1,"Great Idea, but piece of crap product.","I usually don't write negative reviews on products I don't like, guess it's the whole if you don't have anything nice to say about something deal, however I feel would be doing future buyers a disservice if I didn't warn them on this useless piece of crap. The idea is great on these, the execution not so much. The buckle is a piece of plastic mess that's too weak for it's intended purpose and broke on first attempt at tightening. After rigging it so that I can try to at least salvage some of my money, it didn't stay on, kept slipping off after every few step. I wouldn't waste my money buying these spikes if I had to do it again. In the interest of being positive, the spikes seem really strong so if I was looking for useless spikes, then this would be my choice, and I ordered Amazon prime and got them super fast."
1,Garbage,These are garbage. In Theory they would be great if the strap buckle didnt give out ten minutes into my walk. Do yourself a favor and rent the big powered aerator locally for $40 bucks or buy the walk behind push guys.These are not like your dad's aerator sandals.
3,green shoes,I have been wanting to purchase these for quite some time now and have been very hesitant. Well after getting my oldest son (16) to do all the screws we looked for the velcro straps and nothing! So I didn't get the straps that everyone says sucks so badk anyway. I ended up tying them to my feet and went out in my lawn with them but i'm thinking the ground was too soft cuz I kept on sinking. They seem like they will be great once I can find a strap to strap on them and can really check them out.
3,Poor design of the strap-tightening mechanism !,The straps are difficult to tighten on the shoe. Better tightening mechanism and better instructions should be provided with the product.
1,waste of money,I got it and had a try. What I found out is that it didn't work well. it's broken after a couple use. I don't think grass get help in any sense.
1,Terrible,The shoes would not stay fastened to my shoes. It took forever since they kept falling off. Next year I am just going to rent an aerator machine.
1,Neat idea but no go,This is a great concept if it worked. I could not get them to stay on. The shoes kept loosening and slipping. I did try to put the straps through my shoes and them strap it with some success but the toe area kept slipping off.
1,Don't waste your money.,I work at a golf course and every year they plug the fairways and greens. The machine that does this makes 1 - 2 inch plugs that are removed from the surface and mulched. Tiny prong aerators that fit over your shoes or the ones you press into the turf with you foot do not do the job according to the course supervisor where I work. The plugs must be at least one inch in diameter and about 3 inches deep for proper aeration. I have a pair of these shoes and he told me I wasted my money.
4,Worked Great,I went through the reviews and followed the one that said to put the buckles on top of the foot and that worked perfect. I really had no problem with them staying on my feet. I stepped on one of the straps while I was walking and have to replace it but that was the only problem. I trimmed them before hand but it wasn't short enough.
4,straps will break..,i used an old pair of shoes and just duck taped them to the shoes....worked great...perfect for walking behind the mower and getting oxygen to the roots....I use them on our baseball field and have great results....good price
1,Not worth the money,"Great idea if they worked but unfortunately a waste of money. Once spikes gripped the sod, shoes wouldn't stay on my feet, despite numerous adjustments. Buy a hoe instead."
2,aeration shoes,"I experienced difficulty in keeping the shoes on my feet. The straps appear not to secure the shoe enough while walking. The rate of speed when walking is relatively fast due to the ""time is money concept."""
3,My grass thanks me for it!,I will agree with other reviews. The aerator sandals don't stay on by themselves. I just tied them in with my shoelaces and that worked fine. They did a great job aerating my lawn. On a funny note: don't expect to look graceful while using these!
3,AERATOR SANDALS,"Overall the product is great except the plastic buckles broke after a few uses, and they need to use a strap with velcro ends."
2,Nice concept - Poor design,"If your foot is anything bigger than 8.5 mens, then don't even bother! Even with a smaller foot, you probably won't be able to use them with modern tennis shoes, as they won't fit. There must be a reason that the photo on the box pictures a person wearing loafers - When's the last time you mowed your lawn wearing dress shoes? Then there's the strapping system with its completely useless instructions. Did the person that designed the system actually try it out to see if it works? I don't think so! Bottom line - Save your money or just get a Rubik's Cube, it's easier to figure out and would probably fit better on your foot."
2,Aerator Shoes Evaluation,The straps buckles were a big disappointment to me like others have stated. They simply do not hold the straps tight and thus the shoes keep coming off. My solution was to replace the proved buckle with one inch plastic quick snap buckles like you find on a day pack. These stay tight and I can walk all over my lawn for an hour or so and they never come lose and slip off. I used the one inch straps that came with the shoes.
2,Broke after 10 uses.,They worked great for about 10 times and then the strap broke off the shoe part. They cant be used now.
2,Strap too long,I was disappointed the straps were way to long.It did not make sense why then were so long. I cut them but I cut one too much. It was a pain.
2,Marginal Product,Shoes too small for anyone with a decent size foot. Company had no symphathy when called and complained! Did some rework with them to fit over shoe. Would not deal with company again.
2,Hard to walk. Straps bust easily.,"You need big solid shoes or these won't work. If you tighten the straps too much, which you have to do to stop them from coming off, they will break. If you have thin grass, the dirt will stick to your aerotor shoes; tearing up your lawn."
3,takes some practice and patience,"These seem like a good idea, but the spikes are so long that it's hard to walk. You have to pull straight up with your foot, to avoid ripping out pieces of sod. If the ground is a little wet, these get caked up with mud pretty quickly.That said, I use these instead of buying a larger tool, and find that with a little practice, they work fairly well."
1,Waste of money,"I thought this was a nice idea to be able to aerate the lawn while mowing. I attached them to my feet and the first step, they slipped off my feet. I messed with the straps for a couple of minutes but everything I tried resulted in the same result, them just falling off. I then tried to pull one of the straps tight and broke the plastic buckle. My last attempt was to just tie them around my shoes and I managed about 5 steps and thought, ""hey, this is pretty cool"". Just at that moment, one slipped off, I tripped over it and almost impaled myself on the 12 spikes. I wish I could have seen myself because it was probably a pretty comical scene. In all seriousness, I would avoid these shoes until they come up with a better way of keeping them on your feet. The few steps I did take, they seemed to be doing a nice job."
3,Good idea - Awkward to use,"Aeration shoes are great in theory and with some practice can work. However, my feet slid out of the shoes on the fourth step and the strap broke when I tried to put them back on. I have now rigged the shoes to work. Be careful, don't draw the straps too tight. The buckle is plastic and breaks easily."
2,poor construction,"It seemed like a great product. An easy way to aerate while mowing the lawn. The first time I put the sandals on, before stepping off the deck onto the lawn, the buckles on the left sandal broke. Good idea, poor construction."
3,Spiked Heels,For the most part the sandals are functional unless the ground is too hard. The soles are also a bit stiff. Cost factor was fabulous! Shipping costs were outrageous!
2,"Good idea, poor design..","I got them yesterday and I tried them immediately. I can confirm the most of the reviewers opinion: the straps are the worst part. They are way to long and need a design improvement. After some time of spike walking they come loose, they need to have a FASTEX quick release buckle. The heels of the spike soles are way too low. Using both soles at the same time needs some walking practice. Do not forget a stool to attach them to your shoes and start walking - Moist dirt sticks to the soles stay in gras areas.Now using them for 6 months I had to replace the complete attachment straps because the buckles broke. I bought real good straps at an outdoor shop for climbing/hiking and attached Perungia 1' Fastex buckles. Once adjusted to the shoe, I used to wear mid size hiking boots and attach the rear strap behind the shoe flap - now they working fine."
1,Do not buy,"I found this product NOT worth the money.The sloe of shoes do not bend which makes walking impossible. The lenght of the spikes may be okay if you could actually walk. The straps did not hold feet in and kept going off shoes. I almost fell several times trying to make them work then just gave up. It pulls up the lawn. Shoes falls off feet constantly.I had other family members try these shoes as I think it is a great idea but they also could not walk and almost fell down.The way I use them is tie rope through the straps, step on the shoes then pull the shoes up by the rope. Too slow going for me.I think they are a waste of money and so do my family and friends that tried them. I will look into getting golf shoes now to aerator.The one plus is they have several places in the sole you can adjust the strap to see if you can use but I gave up. Not worth a broken hip or leg.In all fairness product is as described. Just cannot use it."
1,Alif,The plastic on one of the straps snapped the second time I used it. Did not want to take the pain to return the shoes so have made do using some shoe laces to replace the straps.
1,Poor Quality,"One of the straps broke the first time I used them. The second time I used them in TN where there are some rocks in the earth every time I walked and stepped on something hard the spikes broke off, be careful you could get hurt with these."
1,Beyond Worthless.,"Believe no one who says these are worthwhile, unless of course you're interested in destroying your lawn. You see, as you walk forward your leg tips forward but the spikes DO NOT. This means that as you pull your foot the grass gets torn up as you walk forward. ALSO you'll be exhausted pulling the spikes out of the ground. In theory its a good idea...in practice its a terrible idea. Rent or hire someone to do this job."
1,Broke During First Use!,"I loved the concept of these aerator shoes which would make manual aerating of the lawn a lot easier. However,upon the first use, both of the plastic clips broke on one of the shoes. Its just a thin plastic that is supposed to hold the strap tightly to the foot. The spikes are going into the ground and have to be pulled back out before taking the next step. Obviously, something durable is needed to withstand a little pressure when the spikes are pulled out of the ground. The packaging says durable, but these things are not the slightest bit durable. We had to rig them up with rope to continue using them. Very disappointed."
2,Not well built,"Like everyone else, the buckles broke just while tightening up the slack. No real pressure at all and they broke. Now I am going to tie the straps together and try to use them that way. They just aren't worth the trouble of sending back. Don't at your own risk."
2,MEH,the plastic and nails seem to be pretty sturdy. the belts are adustable but the will not stay on. the first time I went to put them one the plastic part of the belt Broke off.Not very satisfied with this product
3,Confirmed Bad Ratings,"The set arrived quickly, but the damn buckle broke the second I tried tightening it!!! Tried rigging an alternative buckle system, but have not yet found the right solution. Great idea...Poorly executed by manufacturer."
1,Broke right away!!,"Not a fan! My husband bought these and he put them on, tightened them around his shoes, walked around for about 5 minutes and the plastic piece that holds the straps on broke. He had to duct tape them all around his shoes to keep these on...THE FIRST TIME. He threw them away after that. $13- down the drain. Look for something with better straps and better quality plastic."
1,Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Straps do not hold these sandals on at all. I was able to go about 3 or 4 steps before the sandals stuck into the ground and my feet left the sandals.I know these were cheap but I expected much more. I just threw them into the garbage Don't wast your money!!!!!!!!!
1,Dissapointed,Horrible experience with the shoes. Straps were not tight fitting enough to keep them on tight. When I attempted to tighten the two of the four clasps broke.
1,not for me,I bought 4 sets of these shoes and am not very happy with them. seems like now matter what shoes i have on they slip off and its hard to tighten the straps. the part that goes on the back of the show should be higher
2,Not functional as delivered,"Simply put, these don't stay strapped to my feet as designed and delivered. You need to add additional lacing or web straps at minimum running from the toes to around your ankle/heel to provide the basic stability necessary to take more than a few steps. Your foot isn't a rigid piece of 2x4 making perfectly repetitive heel-to-toe steps over perfectly flat terrain. The buckles on the straps provided are also incredibly flimsy and shattered easily; I resorted to feeding the strap through the loop sewn to hold the buckle. I did complete my lawn, though I'm not sure how thorough the job was. Although I did it while mowing, I don't think I would want to be on record as recommending that strategy for safety reasons--even if the product had worked perfectly. Consider this as raw material for a DIY project at most."
4,Fertilizer and seed spreader,Works great with all the different types of products I needed to use thought it would be a disappointment but it actually if great to use.
4,review before you buy,"After reading the reviews for the aerator shoes, I thought for the price I would give them a try. Like the reviews said, the straps are useless, but if you use skate laces along with the straps they stay on fine. Also, make sure your yard is dry because if it is wet you will pull up chunks of sod. I have a small yard and these shoes work very well. The shoe base is a sturdy plastic and the spikes are strong and secure. I get some strange looks from people walking by but this product has done what I have wanted them to do."
3,Serviceable,"The spikes appear to be solid and they puncture the ground pretty well. The straps are weak (one of the buckles snapped in two the first time I tried to tighten them) and aerating this way is not optimal. For a low price, it was worth a shot. I have fairly compact soil that is clay-based; these probably work better on lighter, loser soil."
3,Strap broke day 1,"The strap broke on day 1 and I really didn't pull it that hard at all. They work well, but the straps are definitely the product's downfall. Do be careful with the spikes as well, they are extremely sharp."
2,grass aerators,"Not too impressed with this product. Hard to keep on and use. Perhaps I just don't weigh enough (thats a first!!),but very hard to use."
2,Mediocre book!,"Basically the author takes the most common techniques and doesn't do a good job of explaining them. The repertoire is trite, overdone material. This book has nothing new to offer and is probably not the best introduction to classical music and techniques."
1,Piece of junk,"I read a previous review that this thing was a piece of junk but ignored it anyway. Well, I should have listened. I own a business and needed a ""fitting room"" type sensor to alert me when customers came through the door. I thought that this device was doing the job although it was annoyingly loud even at its lowest setting. However, it stopped working after 2 weeks. I returned it and although was kinda PO'd that I had to pay to ship it back, I was hopeful that the thing was just a lemon and the next one I would get one would work. I was wrong. The second one stopped working, too!"
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought 4 of these and they stink, pice of junk. Your better throwing your money in the wind."
1,Wish I could give it a BIG FAT ZERO,"I am an in home care provider and stay at night with a woman that has alzheimers. I was concerned that I would not wake up when she got up and would get out of the house. I put this just outside her bedroom door to alert me through the night if she is up and about. It worked great for about four months. I thought she messed with the first set, as I used to leave it at her house after my shift, and ruined it. I am now looking for a different product as the second set is now shot. I have taken the second set home with me when my shift was over, so I know she nor any of the other providers messed with it. I also set it up after she was asleep and it sat on the floor three inches past each side of her door. My advice is to invest in something much better! These are a total waste of money!!!"
1,Don't purchase...not good for anything,I can't say anything good about this item. It just doesn't work. It has to be plugged in to do anything. There is no use for this product. I gave it a one star just to be able to write the review. I'm sorry I didn't send it back right away.
1,Advise against this.,This product does not work if there is any kind of light coming from any source. It goes off randomly and does not go off when it is supposed to.
1,failed after one day,"Worked great for one day. I have tried to go back through Amazon, to no avail. I can't find the manufacturer online. Still trying to return and get one that works."
5,The Short and Medium of It,"Arrived in good order and after using it for several hours in one day I can report no problems and it functioned well. The kit lens that came with the camera was good for the Sony A350, but this lens enhances the camera's utility and effectiveness greatly."
3,This lens frustrate me!,"For portraits and flowers it's a great lens.But for small insects, like plume moths, it's terrible!- With auto-focus the lens is always searching for the moth...- With manual focus, everything is out of focus!I have to take several shots for 1 to be good!"
4,Good lens,"While the 50mm macro is cheaper and lighter (and sharper), the 100mm allows you to have a greater working distance between the lens and the subject, which makes lighting easier. For full 1:1 magnification, the working distance is over 6"", compared to just under 2"" for the 50mm lens. It is much less awkward to use, and not as invasive into the space of your subjects, which might be inclined to fly or crawl away. Moreover, the 100mm focal length is better for portraits, where this lens also serves admirably, with a smooth bokeh (background blur). It is lacking a little bit in sharpness at the widest apertures, but that cleans up in the mid-range. I'd been eyeing this lens for a while, and finally found one on this site used, for a nice discount. Definitely a keeper."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought this for use with the a99. It produced very sharp images but it hunted for focus way too much, even in bright sunlight. To many of the images I shot were out of focus. It was also rather noisy when focusing and the color it produced was not rich enough for my taste. I was unhappy with the lens and returned it."
3,Not as helpful as I thought,"First off, I have super thick curly hair and it holds on to water for a long time. I could see this being great for someone with normal hair but for me it's too thin. My hair soaks the whole towel thru and it's not any drier than if I had used a normal terry cloth towel. I'm going to try it with a regular towel over it and see how it works."
1,poor product,"This is a scam product, the absorbency is no better than a thick turkish hand towel one can find for half the price at TJMaxx or Marshall. It is made in china- that says it all."
2,Short and unenlightening,"I knew it would be short as I saw the word count, but I was hoping for $6 it would tell me SOMEthing I didn't already know.Save your money; if you've ever seen or used a chat support you already know pretty much everything this article has to offer."
5,Great Book,I gave this book as a gift for a couple moving to NYC. They were so excited to receive it. They immediately looked through it and loved the information. It came in good condition and in the timeframe promised.
3,anti gravity chair replacement cord,"Easy to work with but the pieces were a bit thinner and shorter that needed for the chairs we'd purchased four years ago or more at Kohls. Ended up using two kits for one chair, but do have a functional anti-gravity chair again."
3,zero gravity replacement elastic bands,"This product has worked well, but is not easy to replace. Little info about avoiding prolonged exposure to UV rays was the reason my lacing deteriorated. When left stored in sunlight, it should be covered with some form of cover.My own experience with the install of new banding is against their recommendations of working with one side at a time. When working them simultaneously,(back and forth) you'll see they install evenly spaced between the webbed fabric and the side frames. Better instruction details would have helped - especially how best/ where to start the procedure, as well as applying as much tension initially as possible.PS: Newer models have the lacing doubled up throughout-and to order this properly without a model # will make for greater difficulty for customers making this purchase in the future."
3,necessary,"unfortunately, I needed to make this purchase for a repair to a chair well less than a year old that was given as a gift- how embarrassing! I will not reccomend buying the chair"
3,"Good, but not long enough for all brands of recliners.","I bought these to relace two lafuma chairs. The laces were not long enough to relace the chairs so I had to reuse some of the old laces at the foot of the chairs to accomplish the task. Not ideal but it worked. Be sure you know the brand of chair you want to fix before you order. Otherwise, the laces were good enough."
5,Dan,"Great Purchase. A must have if you like traveling, scenic or creative pictures, without matter how much you know about photography."
2,Display Problem,My Sony LCD large screen TV is just over one year old. It has yellow splotch about mid upper screen. A close inspection of the screen reveals a circuit board trace like pattern that is yellow. The set has not been abused or exposed to temperature extremes. A UPS should be used with these units to keep the lamp cooling fan powered in case of a power failure. The lamps are at least $250.00 I would definitely recomend the extended warranty. Is the technology not proven on these large screens? Is the screen going to fail after 3 years when the extended warranty is expired? Sony will not stand behind their product after the warrany is expired. (mine is two weeks out) Other than the display problem the unit has performed flawless. It's a lot of money for a TV that doesn't last more than a year!!!!
4,Fun trip back to pysch. '60's!,"Country Joe hooked up with the Bevis Frond after meeting them in Berkeley and, finding out Nick Saloman was a huge fan, aked if they'd like to back him up when he came over to play England and Scotland. Adrian's son was drafted to play keyboards and this was his first public appearances. The Fish covers are awesome and very psychedelic! Fish and Frond fans alike won't be disappointed!"
3,Better than her newest book,"This book had some insight into it, her latest book was such a disappointment after this book. It took me 5 years and thousands of dollars to have a baby and after having a beautiful child, I too suffered from post partum depression which I would have never believed could have happened since this child was so wanted and so loved. I appreciated that she brought this subject out into the open and was really looking forward to her latest book which was a waste of money. It was nothing more than ""look at me, life is great, I can deal with everything and laugh about it.""This book did mention about her suffering some sexual abuse but she brushed it off like it was no big deal. Sexual abuse in any form is a BIG DEAL! She has daughters, how would she feel if someone even touched the in an inappropriate manner? Call a spade a spade. Sexual abuse should never be glossed over because the abuser will continue and whose child will be the next one on his list?"
2,Her journey to PPD but not too much detail of getting out of it,"The book was just okay for me. She spent most of the time writing about her experience of being severely depressed and how she was just barely surviving day to day, hour to hour. She seems to be a bit ""ANTI"" anti-depressants. I would have liked her to spend more time on her journey out of her depression; how it effected her husband and children, and how she was able to heal those relationships (she mentions that her husband and her seperated for 6 months, kind of as a side note). Also, she talks about questioning everything in her life and her motivation behind everything she is and does, but fails to mention any changes in lifestyle that made a difference in her healing process. Was it only her green manure tea, bubble baths with candles, and going on Oprah that healed her??"
4,Good Advice,Having experienced postpartum depression I could relate to a lot of what she spoke of. This book was helpful to me and getting past some of my experiences with dealing with postpartum.
5,A Man's Point of View,"First, as a fan, I willingly disclose that I purchased the book because it was about Marie. I did not realize that it would have such an impact.I discovered that some of the PPD symptoms were similar to severe PMS symptoms my wife had been suffering from for 20 years. Because of the treatment options suggested by Dr. Moore I was able to make an appointment for my wife, and thanks to the treatment and supplements, the physical symptoms all but vanished.I am now divorced, and on a recent re-read of the book, I was surprised to find myself relating to Marie's feelings of guilt and loss of self-esteem connected with her PPD. The poem at the end of her section of the book has had a profound effect on me as I work to deal with the effects of my divorce.This book will always have a prominent place on my shelf. Thank you Marie and Dr. Judith."
1,FEEL HER PAIN!!,"This book is nothing more than a Victim Seeker's Bible. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her? She is using a sickness for personal glorification and a reason to sell a book. I felt that this book was a big feel sorry for me ego trip and was disappointed because I thought it would have some interesting facts on postpardum depression.Boy,was I wrong."
3,Printing Issue,"Great fit, the problem is that the radiation symbol on my shirt was angled.(slightly shifted)"
2,Quality is only fair.,"The price is reasonable, but there was apparently only one pass for the yellow silkscreen; there's an obvious pattern in the yellow part of the image that shows the black behind it in many places. Could have easily been fixed with another yellow layer. All in all an okay shirt, but not worth more than the ten dollars they charge."
2,"NOT BAD,BUT I'VE HEARD A LOT BETTER 2.5 stars","Carnal Forge has always sounded the same throughout their career but overall not a bad band. This CD has more songs that offer a different sound from their previous releases. At first the listener might find the vocalist annoying(he has a weird pitch between sometimes too high/low plus I have no idea why he tries to sing at times)) like I did,but it kind of grew on me with time. Also the guitar work is excellent on most tracks with more varied riffs unlike their first 2 releases which was nothing that notable. Standout tracks are(BREAKING BOURDARIES,H.B.F SUICIDE,DESTROY LIFE,MY BLOODY RAMPAGE)"
2,Not very impressive,"This book is one of a series dealing with the cuisines of various cultures. I have bought two so far and I am not in a hurry to buy any more, although I do note that the different books have different authors, so perhaps some of the others are worth the money. This particular book, I have to say, is not very good. Other than the section on the medicinal use of foodstuffs in China (which is not bad), most of what is presented can easily be found elsewhere. Most of my Chinese cookbooks give background information about food and cultural practices and cumulatively they cover just about everything I read in this little book. I also note that there were several factual errors in the text. I have to say that, when I come across something in a book that I know to be wrong, I am disinclined to take that book as being an authority on anything else. I am not going to keep this one for my collection."
1,"Poor packaging, disappointing score","I don't recommend purchasing this CD because the packaging was poorly put together and really you get the same music that you get on the original 1CD release. All the additional music sounds poorly recorded and there's a reason that it was unreleased. Overall, very disappointing."
5,You will be mesmerized,"Wow, I am liking this trend. First it was the Star Wars: Special Edition Expanded Score, now it this Warner Bros Archives Complete Superman Score. The sound is phenominal, and I'm still kicking myself for buying the Varese Sarabande release of the ""complete"" score re-recorded...somehow this one is more complete...which means the Varese people lied :( Tis not good that they did, but they earned my money, as does rhino for making this restoration sound better than any re-recording ive heard. Kudos."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST OF ALL FILMSCORES,"Along with Ben Hur and Empire Strikes Back, Superman must rank with the greatest Romantic soundtracks ever penned. John Williams is one of the finest film composers alive, and in the late 70's/early 80's we have him in his prime (in a 6 year span of 75' to 81' he wrote Jaws, The Fury, 1941, Jaws 2, Dracula, Close Encounters, Star Wars, Superman, The Empire Strikes Back, ET, and Indiana Jones...!). This Rhino release is especially noteworthy for the extra versions of the main love theme, in particular the instrumental version of the ""Flying"" sequence (sans Margot Kidder's voice over... thank goodness).This is Williams' masterpiece."
5,SUPERMAN THE MOVIE IS WONDERFULL FOREVER!!!,"It's the very,very,very music of the super-hero movie. It's soundtrack is created for beyond of all generations. Superman The Movie is the last movie view with my dear father,today dead. John Williams,special congratulations from under of my heart. Richard Donner and all working in the montion picture, very thanks forever."
5,"Priceless, a treasure!","This double-CD edition of Superman is outstanding, a true film music gem if ever there was one. I own 70+ John Williams CDs and still can't decide whether this is his best soundtrack of all time. Without this fantastic music, Superman in my opinion wouldn't have gained half of its success. This music is a work of genius.A big round of applause must also go to great talent and wonderful, inspired playing of The London Symphony Orchestra and to rerelease/remaster team. It's really an example of how a great collector's edition of such a great score should look like.If you are a serious collector of JW's music (or soundtracks in general), I believe you already possess this. In case you don't, make sure you do. You'll never regret it."
4,Super CD,"This CD is a wonderful addition to anyone who enjoys the music of John Williams. The extra tracks on the disc alone make it worth owning. There are several cues, mainly ones used either during the Krypton sequences, the Lois and Clark romantic scenes, and the from the last 20 minutes of the film that were not on the original ST album. Sound quality is crisp and clear, but acoustically dry. Wish they added just a touch of reverberation to make it more listenable. The dryness makes the horns in a couple of the alternate versions sound sharp. But the London Symphony Orchestra is performing, and they sound great. The album notes give any fan of the film plenty of fun reading. Only real complaint is the packaging jams the booklet and CD jewel case case into a metallic paper cover which doesn't quite fit. Mine is going to come apart any day now.Still highly recommend."
5,Flawless,"This is John Williams at his finest. This music is so indescribably good, it's a marvel that with each listen it retains it's brilliance. This is what all film music should aspire to be like."
4,All Time Favorite Soundtrack....Its Super!!!,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
3,FLIMSY PLASTIC COVER,"THIS IS A NICE PRODUCT BUT, FOR THE PRICE THEY COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB ON THE PLASTIC COVER. THE STICHING IS POOR AND THE PLASTIC SHOULD BE THICKER.I ONLY HAD MINE A FEW WEEKS NOW AND THE PLASTIC IS ALREADY TORE TWO PLACES ,ONE OF THE SMALL RODS WAS ALSO MISSING THEY SENT IT A FEW DAYS LATER."
4,Perhaps interpretation differs.... but quality is good.,"I am a huge conniseur of choral music, and this CD is not as bad as those other people have made it out to be! Yes, some of the songs may have been performed differently than I have, or they have performed it, but then again, why is music performed? We all give our own interpretations of music when we conduct. Who are we to say which interpretation is better than another? It is all personal taste. Do not let those two pessamists dissuade you from trying it out. They generally blend well, they have dynamics and emotion, and they sing in tune, so what are they griping about! I've enjoyed it."
2,"Holst Singers subpar, singing music of their namesake","This should be *much* better than it is; the singing is less refined here, under Stephen Layton, than the ensemble's older recordings under Hilary Davan Wetton. Much of the repertoire fails to be compelling, too, which is a second strike. ""I Love My Love"", probably the best and most loved piece here, is sung at a painfully slow pace... Sorry, folks, but this disc just isn't worthwhile."
1,Complete rip off,"This video has nothing for kids and is a complete waste of money. I would have thought that the ultimate junior lesson for kids would show some interaction with kids. At least we would have known that the kids are able to understand Clay Chappell's lessons, but NOO!!! We don't even have one kid hitting one ball! All we have is Mr. Chappell's monologue and his mantra "" Hello Mr. Golf Ball, I am going to smash you!!!"" After paying for the video, I feel like saying ""Hello Mr. Clay, I feel like smashing you!!""Buy it only if you really like larger credit card balances."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was excited by the name of this router : ""Open-Source Wireless Router"".Unfortunately soon after plugging it in I was sorely disappointed. The initial setup does NOT WORK WITH FIREFOX - it REQUIRES MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER.How's that for an ""Open-source router""??Eventually, after getting it working (to repeat, you MUST use MSIE for the intial setup), you can, as far as I can tell, capably administer it with Firefox.On to the next problem - no printed manual. How much would it cost to throw in a short manual, Linksys?No documentation explaining how to hack the supposedly ""open-source"" firmware. No links provided either. There is a ""Router Upgrade"" link which lets you upgrade the firmware, at least. I can see I'll be doing that very shortly - hopefully with non-Linksys firmware."
1,It's a toy,It's cheap plastic and the blades are as sharp as a bowling ball. It actually hurts to shave with it.
1,Not worth the bulk,"I was shocked by how bulky this liner was when it arrived. Not only was it bigger than my actual sleeping bag, it weighed more than expected. If you are purchasing this as an extra blanket for couch lounging than it might be the right liner for you. But if you hope to use this outdoors, it is better to fork out the extra money and purchase a silk liner."
2,:(,"This was an odd book. It starts off with a two year old (Nathan) telling his friends in baby talk (that the adults are not supposed to understand) that he is going to get a daddy while on vacation with his mom (Marissa). So they go on vacation, with his mom clueless to his plans, he grabs a jogger on the beach, and the jogger (Jack) breaks his leg and fingers. Marissa feels responsible to help him out, so she does. Nathan starts calling the man daddy right away. After a week they are both in love with the other, but do not want to admit it because of there past heartaches, especially Jack.The story itself is basically about the things that Marissa does for Jack, and the past that is haunting Jack. And it is all wrapped up way to fast at the end. Just when you think that the story is going to start its over. There was so much more that the author could have explored with these characters and it was disappointing that she didn't."
3,This guide is..well.......alright,"I think this guide is alright by telling me where to go but... This guide lacks the info. about the Pokemon. The name of the game is Pokemon, you beat the game with Pokemon. I think that just a guide with the Pokedex showing the moves, evolutions, ect. would be a good guide for me, I bought the guide for that reason, and it was there..."
3,where's the pokedex,This is a helpful book if you don't want pokemon information.The Red and Blue Guide does have pokemon info.
2,"Ok, whats the deal with the pokedex?",Its ok if all your looking for is a way through the basic gym game but if your some one who enjoys the colecting part of the game this guide is a real rip off. Prima you are sorry for seperating the pokedex from the guide and selling it seperatly.
5,It was great,I was listening to my son reading it in the crown books and learned almost everything from it! It will take you step by step and let you have a sourse of help when you need it.
1,Lack of Pokedex VERY FRUSTRATING,"I was disappointed in this guide, due to the lack of detailed strategy. Also, it seemed to gloss over a few of the important areas and treat them like they didn't even exist.It seemed as though the authors quickly wrote it, without verifying strategy and concepts that they described. I expected much more specific and accurate strategy from an official strategy guide. It sure wasn't worth the money in my opinion.If you're really into the game, this ""guide"" will leave you extremely disappointed. I have used Prima's other Pokemon guides and loved them. As a result, I didn't even look through this one before I bought it. I wish I had. If I had known that it didn't even have a pokedex I wouldn't have wasted my money on it. The ""guide"" part isn't that great either. It leaves you guessing on many, many points and is just really confusing. I'm sure there are better guides out there somewhere."
2,Poorly Done to me,I have finshed scanning this guideline for the game and it is a little poorly done.i was so messed up where I was trying to get to next city in Sliver where i have reveiwed.If you do buy it then the money that you have spent is wasted.The text is not writen well.I gave it two starts because the phtos are nice and because a litle was good.The text can be written better but they are other guidelines which I have reveiwed.
2,Prima as dumb as Nintendo's,"This book was a disaponitment. No checklist, no pokedex, and they say NEW pokemon MAY BE HERE. The maps are good and walkthrough is ok. But Nintendo's players guide was even worse. oh well"
2,Helpful.. but could be better,"The book is useful for a beginner. But, more complete info (like a Pokedex) would have gone a long way. There are better websites than this book, if you're looking for g/s tips..."
4,Like new!,The book was a little raggedy from being old but the secrets were still sealed and nothing ripped so it was a great deal instead of having some terribly torn hand-me-down.
3,Prima Pokemon Gold and Silver looses luster,"This guide is not like the past Prima books. It is missing crucial information especially on Pokemon. Will there be another version coming. Let's hope so. If there is a Pokedex available by prima I'd invest in it instead of the guide.The reason I rate this book three stars is because it walks you through, but in the order of trail...not in the order of how you should go. So you will be doing al lot of skipping around in the book to find where you are at. Do we want more. I think the answer is an emphatic yes."
3,Almost a perfect Prima Guide...,"but only almost. This good book to get through the game quickly. As far as finding Pokémon or finding out what they learn at each level (Pokédex info), it only shows Pokédex info on a few of the new Pokémon. The maps of the areas, towns and caves are done really well, as they also show you all the items that can be foundas well as (most) Pokémon listed by whether they appear in the morning, day or night. The charts on the trainers/gym leaders are also well done. The sealed section in the back is useful, if you really get stuck or need a hint. If you prefer more information (i.e. Pokédex, etc...) I recommend the 'Versus Books Official Pokémon Gold & Silver Perfect Guide (Collectors Edition)'."
5,Excellent!,"I read the Angel's Luck Trilogy while in college and immediately went on a search for this book. It took seven years of searching, but as soon as I found it, I bought it, read it and loved it. This is the best JCF book I've read to date. Cool action, slick suspense and engaging characters make this book a must!"
4,A Human Story in a Dystopian Future,"It's not often that I come across a novel that captures my imagination in the way that ""The Company Man"" did. Its premise of an irradiated world run by a collection of mega-corporations is both compelling and fascinating in an odd way. I also enjoyed the characters who inhabit this world, from the main character of Andy Birch, a hit man, spy and saboteur for one of the big corporations, to the evil-hearted scientist on the verge of a breakthrough that Andy Birch is sent to spy on, to the gorgeous Brazilian model wife of the scientist who has some secrets of her own. All in all, this was a great tale, and I've read it at least half a dozen times without tiring of it. For me, this is Faust's best work that I've read so far, and I hope to read more from him in the future."
4,Captivated me....,The Company Man captivated me as a youth when I read Author Joe Clifford Faust's 1st printing as a teenager. I enjoyed it immensely. I felt pulled in by his words. Very nice and I still have the original paperback. :-)
4,Very good book on leadership,"This book was worth its money in my opinion for chapters 1, 2, and 3 alone! In the first three chapters, Finzel writes from a plethora of leadership experience on ""the leader"", ""the task"", and ""the person"". He deals with several issues that most other ""Christian leadership/management books"" don't, such as leadership doubt (10), and the work on the organizational structure that a leader must do (23-24). To me the first three chapters were what set this book apart and were the unique contributions of this book to a market swamped with leadership books saying mostly the same things (not that we don't need to hear it!). The rest of the book was great as well, but the first three made the book excellent...definitely a worthwhile read!"
4,Nice model,I bought this for our easy street trolley line - My grandson and I have some fun with the K-Line easy street series of model trains and roadways. The layout needed a power station to give it purpose and this prebuilt model did the trick. It is simple and very nice and close to scale to give the idea it is making power for the trolley.
5,"It's dabomb, B* witched is great with the music bis",Its fun to listen to it makes you want to get up and dance. The song is good and the music video just puts the iceing on the cake if you no what I mean. If you are not already a B*witched fan this song will make you become one. I wasn't a B*witched fan intill I heard it on Disney. It was one of there music videos. It was dabomb. Hope you people get it because it is selling out quick!
2,Accelerated Hairloss,"Let me start by saying I had high hopes for this product. Needless to say those hopes were dashed to pieces. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have to say that I have more scalp showing then previously before. I will never use this product again. Based on the other reviews it seems to work more for women than men. If you like gambling with your hairloss then roll the dice."
3,Confused,I read may reviews about this product and then finally decided to use it. I feel that my hair only looks healthy once the product has been applied to my scalp but in the longer run I don't see growth of any new hair. I have used it for 4 months now and am contemplating whether to continue using it...
2,Ok,"Bought this one based on reviews of others.Pros: this bottle last for over 3 months (have applied it every evening).Cons: see no results /improvement at all, unfortunately (switched to american crew vials with good results after 2 months of applicatin 6 months appart- hair became more dence, stronger, thicker looking, and less falling).So,maybe for somebody it really works, but I personally would not recommend the NuHair Serum."
3,NuHair Serum,"I am using this product in conjunction with a capsule formula. I can't see that this makes any difference, one way or another although it does feel like it is increasing circulation to my scalp."
4,Heads Up,Please check comment which I wrote in the Vitamin column.I see an improvement using this product for my hair.
2,Nu Hair....new hair do,"Disappointing. I read reviews and thought this was a good product. Upon application, the texture of my hair went from straight to naturally wavy/kinky. It was very greasy and wet. Ive used Dr. miracle and never had this result. For me, its not worth the cost if I cant use it daily without re-blow drying and pressing my hair- kinda defeats the purpose."
2,nu hair,"I didn't use it long enough to see results. I only used it 4-5 days. It made my scalp feel good when I applied it and it made my hair shiny. However it, did not stop the shedding problem I had with my hair."
5,Great product,"I purchased this because it was cheap and figured if it didn't work no real loss. Well it WORKS. I have been using it for about two months and I started seeing results after a month. New hairs have started growing in around my hairline. I saw a commercial for a mascara that was suppose to elongate your lashes but it had the side effect of turning your eyes brown and it might not reverse once you stopped using it. So since this serum was working on my hairline I decided to try it on my lashes. They have grown soooo much. They were long before but like my hairline my lashes had begun to fall out. This stuff has returned them to their original thickness and they are even longer than they were before! I'm talking Diana Ross long! I bought four boxes since the price was so cheap and I'm glad I did because it definetly works! I am about to start a new bottle the first one lasted me two months. I used it twice a day instead of once. New hair growth and longer lashes, I am a happy customer."
3,Missing Major Songs.,"This collection is missing major songs in it. Such as Bryan Adams ""Everything I Do(I Do It For You)"", Michael Jackson's ""Black Or White"" or Paula Abdul's ""Rush Rush"". Otherwise this collection is good overview of 1991. 1991 was a strange year in music especially how 1980s it really was and how the 1980s look and sound lasted longer than you think it did."
5,Best Star Wars making-of book,"What an amazing book! I was fourteen when Star Wars was released, and I used to have ""The Art of Star Wars"" back then. This book, however, is a wonderful treat for us fans, especially now that the movie is thirty years old. It's amazing what the artists, designers and movie crew could do back then, especially if you consider how inexpensive the movie turned out to be (by today's standards, that is). Thanks to J.W. Rinzler for writing this. The one thing that surprised me: it's a big and very heavy book, and it's not a coffee table picture book at all, but a well-documented history of the making of a movie that changed the lives of many."
2,The type is way too small.,"Great book, great illustrations, great stories, but the text is way too small. Make sure to buy a magnifying glass, even if you're not a geezer."
4,Needs a harder cover,"This is a great book for those who love how the original Star Wars movie was made. This is a heavy book and needs a thicker cover. Otherwise, it's great!"
5,Very interesting stuff,"Based on never published interviews done around the time of the shooting and release of Star Wars, this book surprised me in every sense. It's well written, the pictures are great, the interviews lively and very informative, and the result is a truly original book on a movie I thought I knew all about."
5,The Best Behind the Scenes Star Wars Book Hands Down!,This book is phenomenal! I've been a star wars fan since age 3; saw it in the theatre in '77 and yes...it's left an impact. I'm fascinated by historical events and how things are made. The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film (Star Wars)by J.W. Rinzler is no exception. You book was resonably priced and fun to read.Petesasauce
1,Dissatisfied,Difficult and timely to assemble when you just want to inflate the aerobed and go to sleep. Frame cut into mattress and punctured it ruining the aerobed. My suggestion is to purchase the double mattress aerobed if you want a raised bed. It's more comfortable and inflates in a minute.
5,Great Book! This would be a perfect Baby Shower gift!,"This is my first pregnancy and my husband and I have read just about every book out there. We love this book because it gives you more than just the facts - you get incredible life stories, tons of information on baby products, and coupons to save you some money. This book understands that pregnancy is more than just facts, it is an emotional journey. Finally, this book is a great buy - I'll be giving it as a gift at every baby shower I go to!"
4,Great Shredder!!!,"This is a great shredder. It does exactly what I expected it to do. I wish, however, I had paid a bit more to get one that would shred CDs."
5,I love it!,"ThisFellowes Powershred PS-67Cs 8 sheet Confetti Cut Shredderis my 2nd paper shredder. The 1st one I got from Wal-Mart. It was a terrible experience. So I intend to get something nicer. I shopped on line and read the reviews. I am very happy with this one. If I want to be picky is it does get messy a little bit when I take out the trash. It looks good. It doesn't easily jam up even when the papers twist a little when enter the shredder. If it does jam up, I just need to reverse it a bit and it'd recover.I am happy with the look, the price and the delivery!!!"
4,Great Shredder,"This is a great unit, no complaints. We were concerned with spending the extra $$, but we believe you get what you pay for. This is a really good home use shredder, we will probably not use it enough over the years to reflect it's actual potential."
4,CONFETTI PAPER AND CARD SHREDDER,PRODUCT WORKS JUST FINE. SAW THEM FOR MUCH MUCH CHEAPER IN STORES. THAT WAS DISAPOINTING. I REALLY THOUGHT AMAZON WAS HELPING ME SAVE. NOT THIS TIMEFellowes Powershred PS-67Cs 8 sheet Confetti Cut ShredderALSO 8 IS PUSHING IT 5-6-IS BEST FOR MACHINE IT SEEMS. JAMS OR TOO THICK AT 8.
5,Another great shredder,"The Fellowes PS-67Cs is a replacement to a 5+ year old PS60C-2 which stopped working the other day. The bin is a bit bigger than expected, but no real complaints. The cutters seem well built and handle the suggested 8-sheets at a time without issue. The dedicated credit card slot is a nice bonus. The unit is relatively quiet and the proximity safety barrier is a nice feature. For the price, I am very happy with this replacement."
4,Fellowes Shredder,"Good product - however, this is the second one I've purchased due to paper jamming frequently. I just need to be more mindful of the number of sheets I shred at one time. Other than that, serves my personal use quite well."
4,shredearlyshredoften,"Works well. Have had shredder for about 1 month, good power, I shred only 1-2 pages together can shred all my junk mail and disposable paper without any problems. Would reccommend to buy."
2,Not impressed,"I did so much research on shredders prior to chosing this one. Well, so much for that idea. I ended up returning it the VERY SAME DAY I received it. This shredder jammed so many times that I decided no matter what.... I was not keeping it. I never even put more than 8 sheets of paper into it. So disappointed, that I went through all this hassle for this item, and repacking and shipping it back was no fun. I ended up spending more money and ordered the Fellowes Intellishred PS-79ci shredder and I am soooooooo glad I did it. NOT ONE TIME has it jammed. It is also more pleasing to the eye, easier to empty the trash can and I love that it has wheels. I would recommend anyone to look into the upgrade proir to ordering this particular shredder (unless you have extra time in the day to deal with constant paper jams). I comment Amazon for such fast shipping. On both items, it only took 3 days for free shipping."
4,Confetti Cut? Not Quite,"Got this today and while it does do its job as far as shredding, not jamming too often and holding a good amount in the container I don't know why they say its confetti cut when its more like strips. I was led to believe that it cut up the pieces smaller (into actual confetti or crosscut small pieces) then what they are. The cut is about 1 inch in length which to me isnt as secure as a true ""confetti cut"" would be. So for those of you who are expecting this to make actual confetti, it wont. If you want a sturdy shredder that shreds and doesn't jam up, then try this one out. So it still gets 4 stars for its performance (so far) but no star for its cutting technique."
2,Pain to use,"This item requires a lot of ""jostling"" of the shredder head in order to align the shredder to the sensor in the basket or else it will not work. It is very frustrating, to put it mildly. Once you get it in the right position it shreds well, but if you move it even a little bit while it is shredding, it loses the contact and stops. I don't recommend it at all -- there are much better shredders out there to buy."
2,NOT A Confetti Shredder,"I looked at some shredders at Office Depot, and went through 15-20 reviews on Amazon, and a few more on other sites. By the time I got to this one, I wasn't paying enough attention. I saw the high ratings and the words ""confetti"" shredder.So, it's my fault for not paying enough attention to the specs. But it's also Fellowes' fault for claiming that the output can be called confetti. Two inch strips are not confetti. The shredder seems to be ok as a strip shredder, from the small usage I've given it. As some others have noticed, that shredder head is heavy, and you need to take it off the capture bin to empty the bin.Time to find out how to return this to Amazon."
1,Never worked properly,"I have owned mine for a couple of years, and it's never worked right. The ""Safe Sense"" technology has always detected jams when there aren't any. I have always had to fiddle with it to get the green light on for shredding. The switch to disable ""Safe Sense"" is not functional. For the past two months, nothing I seem to do can get the green light. While I invested in a better shredder for my office within months of purchasing this one, I've kept this one at my desk as a personal shredder. It's now going to get thrown away. I guess I got a lemon."
4,I recommend it!,"Excellent shredder. The handle for lifting the shredder head is invaluable, because the piece is quite heavy and therefore bulky. It had a somewhat unpleasant (like machine oil) new-product smell for the first few days, but that has dissipated entirely. Capacity is excellent and it shreds credit cards well too. I definitely recommend this machine."
2,Does not last,I purchased this item as a gift for my husband. Just for normal household use. After 7 monthes we need to cool it off after several sheets. I am very disappointed with this shredder and would not recommend it at all. It even smells like the motor is burning.
3,Where is the Manual?,It arrived yesterday but there was no manual. There was nothing about the 1 year guarentee. There was nothing about the use of shredder oil. I had to go to the manufacturer's web site to get this information. Was this a mistake of does the company not want to provide this information?
4,Rugged and fairly quiet,"I purchased this shredder to replace a Royal that we had for several years. The Royal was noisy, slow and unattractive. It got slower and slower and finally gave up the ghost. After researching medium priced shredders, I settled on this one. It is solid and quiet, and seems to be of much higher quality than my previous shredder. My only caveat is that you have to pick up the whole mechanism to empty the bin (as opposed to sliding a drawer or some other system)."
4,Does the job,"So far (2 months) this machine has lived up to its claims. I got rid of a lot of old papers, and used it 3 or 4 times, pretty constantly for several days in a row. Only once did it need to stop for a rest, but it shredded everything and is easy to handle and empty. I've been very pleased with this product."
3,Fellows PSC5C,"Don't like how heavy the top is to remove and empty the shreddered paper!Fellows PSC5C..a little different model, but looks the same. Very heavy for a woman."
5,dutchman,"I bought this watch for my grandson, who had given me a picture of it that he had obtained from a magazine. He loved the picture and I am sure he will love the watch."
4,A SKILLFUL FICTION DEBUT,"In this, his first book of fiction, poet John Allman paints poignant pictures of working-class New Yorkers. The eight stories present the lives of characters in naturalistic settings as well as a futuristic pursuit, in which a father follows his estranged daughter through the years.Precisely written yet shaded with a poet's pen, the tales are without artifice but complex. In ""Courtship,"" Lucille with her hennaed hair and ample middle-aged figure has left her husband, whom she castigates for having a wandering eye. It seems that Lucille does a little wandering herself before she returns. Home.We meet a night watchman who believes that a co-worker met with foul play, and that he himself may be the next victim. In one of the most smile provoking tales, a psychologist undergoes acupuncture while he broods on his failings and the world's.""Descending Fire & Other Stories"" is a skillful and striking fiction debut.- Gail Cooke"
4,Very good book!!,"I love this book!! It's so cool!! well ... 2 be honest.. i love ALL two of a kind books.. LOLI really like the part where Mary-Kate have 2 go on-stage and then find out she got the wrong ""Sugar"" (by the way.. that's a horse) .. and the ""sugar"" she got now doesn't listen 2 her at all!!! But it all works out anyway...In this book, Ashley get's in a fight with her boyfriend Ross because of a magic-trick, And Ashley didn't know you can't open the magic-box from the inside, so when Ross walks away from her, and she's going to practice by herself.... well she get's stuck in the magic-box, but at the end Ross saves her!!! It's a pretty funny, nice and cute book.. but, i still like ""Surprise,Surprise"" better!!!"
2,Time to go with the flow,"This is the second single off ""Songs for the Deaf"" and on it's own, it's rather good. Imagine crossing stoner rock with progressive pop and you're almost there; definitley something you can dance and sing graciously along to.Why then did it only get two stars? Well, if you're new to QOTSA then it's a good start, but for those like myself who've listened to their whole discography (and maybe even Kyuss)this single had little to offer. Not only is the single on the album, but the two live recordings, ""Do It Again"" (off Songs for the Deaf) and ""Regular John"" (found on their self-titled debut) are badly produced in comparison to the superior ""Song for the Dead"" on the first ""No One Knows"" single.Shame really as ""Go With the Flow"" is one of the strongest tracks on the album."
4,Lucas Arts Got Game,"A great game by Lucas Arts. Granted, Pod Racer was produced in the '90's, but is still a fun game to play in 2009. This product works great with my XP system. Even without a graphics card, the visuals still perform well. There were NO technical glitches while loading the CD. Everything went well. And for the price it is well worth it. My 6 year old son enjoys this a lot. I recommend this game to anyone who hasn't already played current games that use intense graphics like other Star Wars games such as STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT."
1,Bad,I'll make this short I tryed this game on 10 diffrent computers half crash on loading of the game the other half had graphics problems during the game. I had this game before a long time ago and before the cd cracked it was a blast.
3,no split-screen racing,"...You cannot race in split screen! Sure, you can race against 2-8 other players on a LAN, but how many kids have a LAN in their house? We were very disappointed that our two sons wouldn't be able to race against each other like they can in some of their other games, like Lego Racers and Hotwheels. Buyer beware!"
1,What a waste of money :(,This item is useless. I figured it would be a good product considering the price but the door doesn't stay shut and it's not worth paying the shipping to return it. I would discourage anyone from buying this item!!!
4,Oops! SMAP did it again!,"You're witty and informative, and I think you might be attractive! Read my review! At first, this album crept through my delicate veins, bludgeoning them with sharp sticks! And shattered pottery! But soon, I realized that each member of SPAM is like the Planeteers: the five elements being mastered and controlled by rings on their fingers! Also! One is French! SMAP often reminds me of a boy band from the future! You know, when boy bands will be composed entierly of robots with such perfect singing voices, that there are no pesky minor chords! The album makes a happy Englishman of you and your dog if you imagine the songs as predicting the plot for a film (also from the future!)! The Englishman becomes sad when he is left in the pantry!"
3,the power of one,"Personally, I didn't care for this album overmuch. However, I will never regret buying this album since it contains one of my favorite songs --- Takuya's solo ballad, Natsu. As for the rest of the album, I barely liked 3 other songs including Fly, Asahi o mi ni ikou yo mellow session take, and Blues Master Kill and they are by no means my favorite smap songs."
5,"Songs in this album are all great! especially ""5 true love""!","SMAP is the best! At first I like them because I like them (no other reasons). This new album ""Birdman"", I have no special extra feeling towards it. But since I went to the SMAP's concerts this year, man! It was AWESOME! now every time when I listen to the CD, I can hardly forget how the concerts were... excellent!"
2,Why Alouette??,"If you can stand the unbearable overperkiness and artificial constant excitement in the ""children's"" voices, it's a nice intro to music from around the world. Kids don't seem to mind and love it.All expected country stereotypes are duly reinforced, without a mention of any of the issues many of these countries are also associated with. Fine, it's a sugar-coated Dora world.As mentioned before, especially given the mickey-mouse speed at which they speak/sing (CD length is achieved thorough over-repetition), lyrics & translations might have helped.Or not: The French song selected, ""Alouette"", is an extremely CRUEL song about plucking a little bird's feathers, body part by body part... rendered in Dora's excruciatingly upbeat way. Sigh. Couldn't they have picked any less gut-wrenching song, e.g. ""Sur le pont d'Avignon"", ""Frere Jacques"", ""Au clair de la lune"", ...?? We're always skipping ""Alouette"" because I just know too much French to bear it."
4,Quick & easy,"The recipes are really quick and easy, i've already try some of the recipes. There are up to 3 step-by-step photo tutorial with the stunning food photography also. Since the dimensions is a magazine sized, the pictures is big enough to make you drool :)Each recipe also provided with enough information such as: Preparation time, cooking time, serve, Nutrition per serve and sometimes with a small cook's file tips."
2,not so custom,These floor liners do not fit very well. You have to cut tabs off to make them kinda fit. The tabs are not a big deal to cut that really isn't the complaint. When your done cutting them down they still don't want to sit on the floor nicely. I have had them in my Superduty for about 3 weeks and I am not very impressed. I have purchased floor mats for other rigs that fit a lot better.
4,Hell of a Backyard Party,"I had a backyard party for the holiday, and this blender did the job. The Strawberry Daiquiris, Margaritas and other mixed drinks were great!!!! The blender handled the ice without hesitation, and the drinks were really smooth. Great success! I think I might buy another one just for the kitchen and one for just backyard parties. Very good product, and also very beautiful sitting on my kitchen countertop. Wonderful product.Babbs in Chicago!"
1,Atrocious Tai Seng Quality!,"I would like to make it clear from the very start that the 1 star rating is NOT for the movie but for the video quality.I am a big fan of Brigitte Lin after watching her in Swordsman 2 & The Bride With White Hair. It has come to the stage where I must collect all her movies. This is why I was so excited to find this 1983 movie at Amazon. My excitement turned to disappointment when I played this tape. Obviously Tai Seng must have recorded this with dirty video heads.The picture is smeared & lacks focus. There is picture interference.Most important of all, the English subtitles fall off the screen after the first 12 minutes after being only slightly better the fist 10 minutes. Selling this tape is detrimental to Tai Seng's reputation as there is no quality control!"
5,Oreck Portable Vac Bags,There have been a lot of negative reviews on this item but the one I received was a genuine Oreck product and that makes it a good deal for the price.
3,Oreck Canister Bags,"These vacuum cleaner bags do not work with the Oreck (Ironman) canister. I will try to do my best to use them, since they are so much cheaper. The vacuum I have uses the round opening, and this has a small square opening, and square design."
5,A Clean Sweep..,"These vacuum cleaner bags are the best price I have ever gotton, Usually the cost way more than I paid. Stock up on this GREAT DEAL."
5,Vacume bags,I received my bags on time and they were in excellent condition.I have had great experience with ordering the vacume and the bags both.
1,oreck bags,"I CHOSE THIS BECAUSE THE BAGS YOU SENT ME,FOR THE MACHINE I BOUGHT FROM YOU, ARE THE WRONG ONES.YOU SENT #PKBB12DW AND THE BAG IN THE MACHINE SAYS IT SHOULD BE #PK12FC1000.THE ONES YOU SENT WON'T EVEN FIT IN THE SLOTS.I JUST OPENED THE BAG TODAY AND NOW YOUR WEBSITE SAYS IT IS TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.I WOULD LIKE BAGS TO FIT THE ORECK I BOUGHT,THE ONES I PAID FOR ARE OF NO USE TO ME.THEY ARE FOR A HAND HELD MACHINE.THIS COULD REALLY STOP ME FROM ORDERING FROM AMAZON,I AM VERY UPSET AS I NEED THE BAGS NOW."
5,The Oreck portable is great,The bags for the Orect portable fit perfectly. The cost is great. I am glad I was able to purchase
5,Great Service,"Since I was not having much luck finding these bags in retail stores, I was happy to see they were being sold online. The bags arrived before the promised date and in perfect condition."
1,Mislabeled. Generic Envirocare Bags,Seller needs to be more clear that these bags are Envirocare generics and NOT Oreck
5,great for me!,"I was a little hesitant to buy Oreck items on line for fear that they would be a similar but fake product. These are the exact same bag that I purchased from the Oreck store but paid dearly for them. With six cats and a dog, and hardwood floors, I go through these like crazy. I am extremely pleased to get a great product and at and super price! Fast shipping too!!"
4,replaces the bags that I had been using,These bags work great!No problems with them.they are what came with the vacuum .
5,Works perfectly,"I have the Oreck XL handheld vacuum, and have been looking for a source for replacement bags. Glad I found these! They fit perfectly and (as far as I can tell anyway) are genuine Oreck replacement bags. They look exactly like the one I took out of the vacuum (which was the original bag from the manufacturer), and I haven't had any problems with the bag becoming loose or not fitting properly."
5,Exactly as described,"I was skeptical about ordering these bags because of the numerous negative reviews stating that the bags they received were not genuine Oreck bags. Unfortunately, the reviews do not indicate the merchant from whom those bags were purchased. I decided to take the chance anyway, and I'm glad I did because I received exactly what is described here. I ordered these, as well as two other types of Oreck bags from GoVacuum and they were all as described. I have no complaints with my purchase and wanted to leave feedback for anyone who is leary about ordering because of the reviews."
5,Osteoportante,"This is a solid text concerning everything Osteoporosis. Contains useful charts, tables, and diagrams. It lacks in the color-picture department (or color-anything [excluding the groovy colors on the hardcover book's exterior]), but this lack of colour and pictures is not a deal breaker for me. It is still a great book."
3,Richard Smallwood's Journey,"Listened to CD online and thought I would really enjoy product. That said, the CD is marginal at best. Richard Smallwood is still a genius. It just didn't show up on this project."
3,"Richard Smallwood ""Journey: Live in New York""","I am a Richard Smallwood fan - was looking forward to this long awaited CD. I play Live in Atlanta all of the time. However, when I got this one and played it through, I was disappointed - it really didn't grab at me like his other work. So, I played it again, giving it my complete attention - no change. I really haven't played it much since then. I don't hate it, just not thrilled with it. It's pleasant, but not really one that you throw on and play over and over again."
5,Awesome Lady,This is an awesome CD like all of Richard Smallwood's music. I too have waited for this project with great anticipation. My favorite selection was JOURNEY with Kim Burrell. This is a classic Smallwood song. I just love it and can hear it over and over again. I applaud Minister Smallwood for bringing in some additional voices such as THE HAWKINS & THE ORIGINAL SMALLWOOD SINGERS. I grew up in their era. I just love their music. Keep it up Minister Smallwood.
2,Richard wat happened?!,"I will start of by sayin I am 17 and every since I was 6 I have loved Richard Smallwood, I would beg my mom 2 get me his cds. However when I heard he was doin I live recording back in ""2005"" I was so excited and then I was disoppointed by the 2 yr wait. I was so excited on June 5 I got in my car and rushed 2 walmart 2 get it. When I got 2 my car and heard the cd I was felt cheated and let down. I was so lookin foward 2 this cd and it only had 2 songs I liked and a 1:30 rip off praise break I felt cheated out of 15 dollars. In sayin all this I luv Richard but da cd sucks!"
4,Good CD,"It was nice to hear all of the groups from the past come together and sing. I also enjoyed the Kelly Price song. She should have been singing gospel all the time. That's where she belongs because she has really flourished as a gospel singer. The only thing missing was solos by Vannessa Williams, Mauretter Brown-Clark and Charisse Nelson-McIntosh."
3,"Pretty sad, but it's still Wing Commander...","As mentioned before, there were a lot of things wrong with this book. Blair was a weak old man, getting beat up in bars, Vagabond and Catscratch weren't even there, and the character of Decker, in my own opinion, was all wrong. Some things were a tad unbelievable, such as fighter pilots flipping through an actual book in the cockpit instead of looking at a computer or something. After all, it is the twenty-seventh century! Sure, this book has some major problems, but it is still Wing Commander and a decent read nonetheless."
4,Editing has a purpose,"I have to say, after Reading the Price of Freedom, that I understand why the origin people decided against putting much of this in their game. I do not agree with the Romance with Sosa(We all know she was Catscratch's gal, hence her appreciation when you save him), or his vagrant appearance. Heart of the Tiger showed the true Blair, A patriot, not at slob. I was very unhappy with vagabonds cameo..but everyone knows Blair was an idiot and stayed with Confed until the last minute. However, the author is articulate in pretty well everything else. I recommend this rather highly!"
2,To different,"This book has it all wrong. The border world's flying outdated craft. NO WAY!! Tolowyn is potrayed all wrong. Same with Blair. Blair never fell in love with Sosa! What happend to Catscratch? He was in it for about two pages! And last but not least, The Lexington is not a Concordia class carrier! It is the same class as the old rust bucket in Wing Commander 3. The Victory. Anyway. On the bright side it has the wing commander name on it and that has to count for something ehh?"
3,A Major Shake-Off,"Hardly to believe! The plot and story was quite based on the WC4 game, but the Border Worlders flying outdated crafts? Quite ridiculous and inconsistent with the game, such as the Avenger and Banshee-class fighters don't appear in the novel. I would say the story is good (including the unnecessary romance between Blair and Sosa), but the fighters' details are all wrong."
1,Too many liberties with the storyline,"This book simply butchers the story. Blair was a hero and a tough guy, not some weakling, who just about gets killed at the beginning. Furthermore, the idea of a full Colonel, who is over forty, having some sort of romance with a Lieutenant, who is not only his subordinate but about half his age, is simply disgusting, not to mention having nothing to do with the actual story. Avoid this book, if you have any concern for accuracy in the Wing Commander universe."
5,One of the best,One of the best hands-on leadership books I have read. Excellent tips and practices. Great stories. Very practical with items that can be implemented immediately. Very thought provoking.
5,Tales From the Top is a must read for business leaders,"""Graham's experienced, original, honest approach in helping business unit leaders improve themselves, which in turn improves the companies they run, is powerful and full of real work and world wisdom. Tales From the Top is a must read for managers and business leaders"""
5,awesome,"voices are great -music is great -kids love it --i even like it !!some great singers children and adults alike-also very educational while not seeming to be ""lessons""-its fun and sounds great"
4,Not exactly what I wanted,"I was looking for a CD of French folk songs or popular children's songs in French and this is not that. Every song is sung in English AND in French within the song with a lot of English dialog. If this is what you are looking for, then this is perfect. I wanted all French to immerse my child in that language, rather than flipping back and forth."
4,"The ""tricks"" to pad expenses were very clever","Employee X is obviously very good at thinking up ways to cheat his employer. I am a Controller at a company that has about 75 expense filers. After I read the book I reviewed some old expense reports and realized that we had no way to catch some of the fraud the ""author"" recommends. I dug deeper and looked at the sales department expenses and was floored by the amount of errors and outright cheating. Thanks to Employee X we looked at ways to improve our auditing. We ended up going with a web product called expense expert and our employees suddenly started submitting smaller expense reports and we could easily spot ""mistakes"". Read the book if you are in finance but keep it away from your sales people."
3,how real is this?,"It all sounds too good to be true. These days there is so many good tools to enforce expense report compliance.I've used e.g. ABUKAI Expenses for my expense reports [...]. You take photos of your receipts with your phone, then it creates the expense report for me automatically. It makes life so much easier, but also ensures compliance. Better for the company an for me as an employee... We spend too much time on expense reporting in this world... and now we even write books about it. :-)"
2,Conflict and Silence of the Heart,This is two movies on one disc. The first movie Conflict I only gave it a 3 stars. The picture quality and color was not very good at all. THe 2nd movie Silence of the Heart I gave it three stars as well but it was an ok movie.
3,Just a quick review,"Im sure anyone reading this knows, that this is not a metal album, i only start with this cause i know a few people who love burzum just by downloading random songs and they have no idea varg even put music like this out. But basically this cd is kinda like the soundtrack to a RPG game on a super nintendo. Its not great, but you love the game, so it gets stuck in your head, you hear it everywhere you go, then when you come back to playing it, You start to dig it cause its has a fimiliar quality to it, so get a cheap old rpg, mute the tv, and put this in"
1,No..,"I can easily and absolutely say that ""this book is not a book that satisfy me about my area.I am looking for alternatives..."
3,Overrated...,"Johnson's High Speed Digital Design (1993) is widely cited as the definitive book on signal integrity for digital design. I've had it on my bookshelf now for about 4 years, but to be honest: I regret buying it.The subject overview is definitely useful; however, as some have pointed out, the theoretical coverage isn't very good. Johnson presents a lot of equations, but without giving readers an intuitive understanding of what's really going on.Also, IMO, Johnson isn't a good writer. He lacks depth and the ability to explain things clearly. To be honest, to learn signal integrity, there isn't really a good book out there."
3,An overview/summary with little theoretical development,"An overview/summary of many basic concepts but with little theoretical development based on physical models. For example, the authors discuss transmission lines but don't trouble themselves to show the incremental circuit model of a transmission line or the differential circuit equations, they simply state the solution of the differential equations. Likewise the authors inadequately discuss how terminations affect transmission lines and fail to show how the reflection coefficient follow from the physical model. The point of showing the theoretical underpinnings is to make clear when the stated solutions are valid and more importantly, not valid. In ignoring the physical models, the authors do a disservice to their readers. An altogether disappointing book."
3,"Ok, not as good as Philadelphia Chickens!","This book and CD was not as good as I hoped. I did buy it for my toddler son, however, so maybe it had more to do with him not getting into the music as much as I thought he would. The book is very cute, though, and I'm sure there are many kids out there who love it! As always, the songs are very creative."
5,Calming for Autistic Grandsons,"We have two Autistic grandsons, 2.5 years and 5.5 years old. They love this book and music so much we had to buy a second copy so they would not fight over the book. The older boy likes to follow the lyrics in the book while the CD is playing and has memorized many of the songs. The younger one likes the pictures.The CD is especially helpful in the car. We get stuck in traffic driving from daycare to therapy and the trip sometimes takes an hour. The CD smoothes everything out for the boys.And, we, the grandparents, like the music so well that we sing along.We have bought two other music books by Boynton and Ford. We like them but ""Tap"" is still the winner!"
4,rhinoceros tap,"This tap will make a long journey shorter with little ones in the car. The tunes makes a change from the usual nursery rthyms that we endure in the car. The music is funky. The songs are funny and easy to learn. It is the only tape my husband will have in HIS car. Occasionally I find him tapping his toe to the music. The book helped me learn of the words and when my daughter is older I am sure she will enjoy reading it too. At 2 years she is still a little young to even appreciate the graphics. Our favourite tune is ""Tickle Time"". When the whole family joins in we usually end up on the floor laughing. This tape will always remind me of my family having a great time together. It does not fail to put a smile on my daughters face."
5,"The Best Tapping Songs, Let's Hit It!","My 33-month toddler has outgrown his nursery ryhmes. If you have an active toddler who has a sense of humor, you may want to try this out. His favourite tunes are definitely ""Tickle Time"", ""Lonely Peas"" and ""Rhinoceros Tap"", but most of all, he enjoys all the songs, including ""Turkey Love"", ""So Long, Doggies"" and he will shout at ""Horns to Toes"" etc.Catchy tunes, witty words, funny creatures with really fun songs, my son's rhythm tapping is getting pretty steady. Though it's a bit more to pay for this audio book (as per our currency exchange), I couldn't find any other children's songs as creative as this ONE! See the way my son tapped along with the songs, I knew Sandra Boynton had it all!"
5,So Much Fun,"This CD is fun for children and their parents and the book is a plus. If you are musical, the sheet music makes it even better as you can play the silly songs any time."
5,Great for both adults and kids,"I've always been a fan of Sandra Boynton's sense of humor. I was delighted to find that the songs in this book have humor for adults, especially music-lovers, as well as for children. My 2-year-old daughter likes to hear me play the songs at the piano as she plays along, and ""tickle time"" has become a buzz-word at our house! I only wish there were a CD version."
5,Childrens Music that adults love too!,"I have a hard time listening to most ""Children's Music"" even once, but no one in our family ever tires of this one. The music is sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy but simple and catchy enough that children love it. My 3 year old knows all the words. The music is varied and the lyrics are witty and humorous to all ages. This has been the birthday present of choice for all my daughter's friends this year. It's hard to find though - I was happy to find it here."
5,Brilliant and fun for kids and grownups alike!,"My son got this as a gift as a toddler, and I immediately filed it away, figuring it was probably just another cheesy kid's CD (I am a total music snob and can't stand most music marketed for kids). Somehow the CD made its way to the player one day and WOW! The songs were actually quite ingenious and musically charming! The production is pretty basic- it's pretty much one guy singing with a synthesizer providing most of the instrumentals. If the songs weren't so cleverly well-written, I would probably have a hard time with the somewhat limited production value. The singer, and Sandra Boynton, score major music geek points with me for pulling off so many different styles of music on one CD. And of course, the lyrics are silly enough to entertain even the most stoic of adults- not a small victory when you're trapped in the car with a little monarch who wants you to put on the same music EVERY SINGLE TIME!"
4,"Witty and Playful, and Adults Won't Hang Themselves","My 3-year-old daughter LOVES this book & CD. She's always been a Boynton book fan and she would have this CD on 24/7 if we'd let her. And we almost do. Like all truly good children's works, it appeals on a basic level to the kids with the pictures of the cute animals and the silly situations, but it also has just enough under-the-radar puns and allusions that adults won't go stark raving mad on repeat #118. The music is really well written and perfectly satirizes the various genres it shoots for. Adam Byant's vocals are fun and camp. Nice job to the whole crew who put it together! Next birthday will be Philadelphia Chickens."
5,Seriously Silly is an Understatement,"These children's songs are upbeat and good for play time. The production qualities are high, as usual with Boynton CDs, and much thought went into the selection of the silly lyrics. Maybe not as much fun as Grunt (a bed time favorite at our house), or Philadelphia Chickens, the children have had a lot of fun with moving to this music."
3,"Looks nice, but fairly small","I really like the look of the shower curtain, but it doesn't fit over my standard liner. Measure carefully if you care, it barely fills my standard size shower."
3,Waffle Shower Curtain,"Great item but I got one at WalMart after I ordered this one, for $20. So shop around. Nice weight and perfect for what I wanted though."
3,s. curtain,"OK enough, but part of the ""weave' is SHINY, not what one expects from waffle weave - also it doesn't have the three-d quality of real waffle weave - this is a flat, mini brocade like fabric, not anything like the pottery barn cotton waffle weave s. curtains it affects to copy."
3,Scholarly Sondheim,"This is an excellent publication, but very dense, and designed for the musicologist rather than just the fan. This covers Sondheim's works up to and including ""Into The Woods"".Banfield is not ""starry eyed"" about Sondheim, and is, at times, critical of his 'borrowings' from other composers. He also insists on placing all his citations within the body of the text, rather than as footnotes or as an appendix at the end of the book. This makes for a very disjointed reading experience.Worth a visit, but quite a plod through it's technicalities."
3,"Impressive, arrogant, unclear...","Despite the wealth of information which is hidden in this book, the professorial writing style makes it very difficult to unearth. The average sentence runs on for 7 full-length lines, and is annoyingly interrupted by literary name-dropping (Sondheim 1980) disguised as references and countless ""the former"" and ""the latter""s. Many opinions are arrogantly offered with no clear examples, which is sadly typical of the ""professor"" mentality. I'm ashamed that my own college music lit professor is the editor of the series, and didn't ask the author to rewrite the book in a style meant to communicate rather than pontificate."
5,Thoroughly satisfied,"I bought this product as a gift for my father. He wanted good quality, durable shears, and that's just what he got."
4,quick and easy arts project for little tots,"the other reveiwers are right. the stamp pad dries out so quickly. it also takes a little strength to create a good enough stamp. my two year old still has trouble, my 3 year old is better at it. it is nice that it comes with two little wooden boxes so each kid has a set of their own. the little stamps are perfect for their hand sizes. they seem to have more fun stamping their hands and arms and me than paper though! every time i pull it out to play the fun lasts about 10 minutes before we're on to the next game. clean up isn't bad either, just hand washing. don't need to guard their clothes as the ink dries quickly or sweep or wipe anything down. i'd recommend it for a quick and easy arts and crafts project."
1,"Poor design, inkpad dries out too quickly","The storage box for these stamps is poorly designed. Theres no lid, which means with kids, no chance of keeping all of the stamps together. The stamps are cute enough, quite small impressions, rougly half an inch. I gave them to my son and his cousins (ages 4, 3.5 and 2) and they played with them for one session and then were bored. we've already lost a few stampers, the ink pad is pretty much dried out and the kids say no when I ask them if they'd like to stamp again. Definite waste of money for us."
4,Thanks!,Bought it new for a price you couln't resist. The cd jewels case have a little crack probably done on it way here. My favorite Usurper Album for $5 new! Thanks guys!
5,Awesome!!,"Marc Estes is an incredible man of God!! I'll be honest, this book isnt for everyone but I highly recommend it. Having the chance to work with Marc on little side jobs here and there has allowed me to see his heart towards this book and if just one person was touched by it, all the time he put into it was worth it. Awesome job Pastor Marc!!"
3,"Donnie Yen Collection,vol. 2",this movie sucks... all English subtitles only...I only like two movies in this one. even though I'm a big fan of Donnie Yen Kung fu films... it was a disappointing experience to actually thought that this was gonna be the bomb...you know!!! I wouldn't recommend this to the people I know...sorry:-( poor quality of picture and sound....
4,A kick-butt pragmatic review - USEFUL!,"This is a great book for someone who is hoping to steal financial engineering practices from one industry to apply them in another. I loved this book- we've already ordered two more copies for people in my work group. Experienced or neophyte, if you're into risk management and/or developing new financial instruments get this one"
3,"All Seeing I, The - 1st Man In Space","The All Seeing I, with the first of two 1st Man in Space EP, shows how expansive their music is. Leaving off the strangely catchy lead single, ""Sweet Music"" is a house track that rivals any other the dancefloor, while ""Luxury 1"" is more or less a rock song, with severely processed guitars and whistling synths. Full of pep!"
5,Love the storyline and the clothes,"I first read Paradise Kiss in the Japanese mag, Zipper. Since I don't know Japanese, I don't know what the story is all about but just admire the drawings( the clothes are just so awesome!). Now I have read the manga (finally!) and I think Ai Yazawa is quite stick to the reality that we need to face every day. Of course, she has magnified the small parts which makes the manga a lot funnier than we are in real life. But this does not make her manga plain. The clothes are so glamorous (u will wish to wear those out!) and detailed; and the characters are very different from one another. Trust me, you will like it! ( I bought some of her other mangas too!)"
1,"Much too expensive, warranty sub-par","You can find comparable 13 watt CF bulbs at Home Depot for $4.88 / 4 pack. The Home Depot bulbs have a longer warranty.I bought both these bulbs and the Home Depot bulbs and can not tell a bit of difference in color, ramp-up time, etc.Save your money -- which you are probably aiming to do by shopping for items like this anyway."
3,Good compact size but weak initial illumination,Compact size is definitely an advantage. I was able to directly replace two ceiling incandescents enclosed in a decorative globe and didn't have any fit issues. The only issue is that it takes probably a good minute sometimes for them to start really lighting up. The issue seems to be more noticable in colder environments.
4,They Fit!,"I love these because they are the only CFLs I could fine that would fit in my Craftsman Garage Door opener.The plastic base (the ballast) is smaller on these, than other CFLs, so they fit down in the recessed socket on the opener. Yes they may be more expensive than other CFLs at your local home improvement store, but if you are having trouble finding ones that will fit certain fixtures because of the base being too big, give these a try."
5,Great guide for Southern California and Santa Barbara,Not too heavy but packed with information. This guide will take you from Santa Barbara to San Diego.
5,Very Helpful,"These guides are always helpful. There is something for everyone. There's a good mix of everything you could want; from shopping to dinners etc etc. I've always found their books to be 99% acurate (as far as prices etc for sights), and they are well detailed. This book is no different. You'll find your travels much easier with this."
2,Bah,So-so. The Authority at least meant Millar could cut his teeth for The Ultimates. Read that instead.
1,I couldn't make sense of it all,"I picked up this comic in the library as I was not familiar with the premise for The Authority. I gathered that it was about a bunch of superheroes storyline.Obviously I am missing something here as I couldn't understand the book nor did I bother to finish it as it was obviously part of a running series. If these heroes are world beaters, why do they have everyday problems? Stan Lee did it best with Spiderman. But Spiderman was no world beater.Funny how comics has evolved to the point where it is all about niche interests and on-going cataclysmic events. What is there to do for a finale?"
1,Does NOT fit Jeep Cherokee!,"Badly designed and does not fit a 2001 Jeep Cherokee as claimed. The brackets that bolt to the undercarriage do not have holes that match holes in the undercarriage, and you have to drill extra holes in the 1/4"" steel. Not easy unless you have access to a large drill press. The brackets are angled wrong; you're supposed to be able to install the drawbar on the side brackets had have it parallel the bumper and frame. The brackets do not permit this. When installed, they point inward at the wrong angle making the drawbar virtually impossible to install. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAPPY HITCH!"
4,reese towpower,the hitch is working out great i put the hitch on a 86 nissan 720 king cab v6 we had to drill 4 holes for this truck i have towed a lot of cars with this hitch it is a good hitch the only thing i did not like is the receiver slide size 1 1/4 i wish it would have been a 2 the shipping was very fast overall i got a good deal and a great hitchthank youdiane
5,Roll Top Desk,"I am delighted with this item and it ticks all the correct boxes for me. It looks a really nice substantial piece of furniture and the workmanship and finish is very good. The desk is so functional with lots of storage space to encompass all requirements of a home office and its comfortable to work at. I did a lot of research before I purchased this item but it has exceeded my expectations in all respects. Delivery was quick and operators were efficient and friendly, the entire purchase could not have been any better.There was a minimal amount of set up required and I undertook that myself. The final step is putting the top onto the base and 2 people are needed for that."
2,Deceptive,"This seller fails to mention that this product is made in China. It is not made of hardwood. It is made mostly of particle board. Very flimsy and easy to peel off the finish if you are not careful. I never believed Deluxe, as a real deluxe rolltop starts around 3000 or more. If you just need a cheap everyday workstation this is ok. I would seriously consider having the seller assemble and install as returning 500 lbs of product yourself would be a seriuos undertaking. Even if you get a refund. Mine had minimal damage on the base from particle board peeling off. If I had seen this before I would have had them take it back. I decided it was not worth the hassle to repackage it and send it back since I can't see the damage behind the desk. But particle board is a long shot away from hardwood."
2,Not as good as I was expecting,"I had seen several clips on YouTube from various episodes of VPN so I was expecting this to be a lot better than it was. I'm not a big fan of Zombie Family, and there are too many Zombie Family scenes for me."
1,"Terrible Sound, NOT A GOOD PURCHASE","I purchased this for my 3 year old because it was similar to my own piano (minus the pink coloring). The sound was aweful, non piano like, and the keys were really loose. So bad that you could slide them from left to right. Definatly NOT worth the money. Its cute, when not being played. Its not in tune and sounds aweful. If you don't care about what it sounds like, the this piano's for you. If you want it to sound like a genuine piano, look elsewhere."
2,Not for fans of more simplistic art,"This was one book that I wouldn't have bought if I had ""browsed"" thru it in a book store. We are new to scrollsawing and therefore were buying various pattern books for ideas and such. The word ""artistic"" in this book's title should have tipped me off; the majority of the patterns are quite ""artsy"" by which I mean they are a little too odd for me; pretty modern stuff. I seem to favor patterns like those of Judy Gale Roberts."
3,"patterns only, not a how-to book","The patterns are definitely different & there are several that I want to tackle. Unfortunately, there are almost no instructions. Some of the color photos give a little info, such as wood type used & thickness. The items that I am most interested in, however, don't give me nearly enough to get started. There is a great-looking dragon table, but no construction info. The metal pieces say they are cut from copper, but not what thickness. It does say at the beginning of the book that woodworking instructions are covered in previous books , and at the end there is a very good 6 page review of other books by the author. I'm sure once I know what I'm doing, I will enjoy using this book."
2,Pass on this book,This book is extremely over priced and has very little value to the hobbyist scroll saw worker. The book offers almost no usable help or information. Save your money and buy a child's coloring book and you'll get the same patterns for a lot less money. I have two scroll saw books by this author and I wish I had saved my money and not purchased either book. This book is nothing but silhouetted sophomoric drawings and has very little substance.
5,quilt of mirrors,"Kafka and Joyce would've loved this multi-storied story. Taking us from Florence to Peru's urban and jungle life in a single bound, the author gives us a friend's devotion, and a people's insular lore. A perspective on perspectives, the book's rarified heights of awareness open vistas on storytelling as a cultural bloodstream: anti-establishment, subversive and yet nutrient-rich. Who, though, will follow in the storyteller's footsteps? Llosa is a mental emperor contemplating existence as a cockroach, a peruvian dreaming he's an innocent primitive, a sophisticate drinking expresso, dreaming of pristine jungle streams, and strains of stravinsky amid the confusion of birdsong. Llosa shows us the fly on the wall's complex view of the mind and the ingenuity and prerequisites of elemental humanity's endurance."
1,Ridiculous book,This book makes no sense. I normally enjoy books of this type but this one was incomprehensible. Didn't even finish it.
4,The impossible story,"This book is a dense and rewarding exploration of the meaning of stories in cultural identity. It takes a penetrating look at a tribe of Amazonian Indians that is uncompromising in its effort to represent their culture on its own terms. Alternating between chapters which describe the ""First World"" narrator's discovery of his story and chapters which attempt to record a cultural history through the stories of the tribe, the book draws our attention to the serious difficulties of cross-cultural understanding. What is translation? What is culture? What do we do when we ""study"" culture, when we translate language, when we approximate or translate the forms of their stories? The book is dense in the storytelling chapters, but the challenges have tremendous rewards."
4,All you need to know!,This cd contains the story of all the spice girls how alotof them come from diffrent backgrounds. None of them dividedfitted in any where acecept for in the spice girls howall of them got to let their personalitys shine in thespice girls and everyone's diffrent so even if they were allplaine individuals i would have still accepted them as a person.
5,caution,"This line is incredible. However there was one problem I encountered. A few of the pegs which are esential for display purposes were broken. And of course this is only evident after opening the package. I found I was able to fix it, but still."
5,Excellent resource,"This book is an excellent, no-nonsense emergency preparedness resource. No fluff, no filler. Mr. Lundin is straight to the point on the why and the what on this topic. Heeding the advice in this book, as well as developing the proper mindset and ability to think on your own could very well save your life or the life of a loved one.Good photo section and advice on the preparation of an emergency preparedness kit.Well done."
5,Great Book,"Lundin goes beyong just the gear list for a ""survival kit"" and discusses the importance of regulating body temerature. Most other books do this but they do not go into as much detail to help you understand. Lundin also discusses the psychology of a survival situation that other authors do not do at all. Unless you have been lost in the wilderness alone you will not know what happens but Lundin does an excellent job of explaining not only what happens but how to overcome the situation. Excellent book to read but like he says, in order to fully understand the concepts you need to get out in the wild and take a survival course."
1,Borrow this one before wasting your money,If somebody has ever told you that you don't have enough common sense to know when to come in out of the rain then maybe this book is for you. Or if you are unable to figure out how to light a fire with a match when you are cold then this book may be for you. I could keep going but I will just end by saying that there is nothing worth paying money for in this book if you hung onto the lick of common sense you were born with.
5,One of the best approaches to wilderness survival I've read!,"Much of the information in this book might seem like old news to many survivalists, but for newcomers and veterans alike, this book puts survival priority setting into a perspective that most other survival literature doesn't even begin to address. Cody's focus on minimalism in gear and his in depth knowledge on the working of the human body in extreme environments is unparalleled and invaluable. If you love getting lost in the woods once a month or you go car camping once ever other year, you should read this book, it could save your life and the lives of ones you love. His great sense of humor and extremely accessible writing style means you can give this book to just about anyone and they can expect to learn a great deal on the art of staying alive!"
4,great read,This Book is an awesome read and is full of great info that you can use in your everyday life not just surviving but for living
2,Not what I was execting,"I purchased this book and alsoWhen All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need To Survive When Disaster Strikesbased on the overwhelming positive reviews. After attempting to read both books, I've finally given up. The style used is very cheesy and hard to follow or even determine what point the author is trying to make. I could not glean any useful information from either book and would not recommend them to anyone that I know. It seems like Mr. Lundin is a good and knowledgeable survival guide, I just don't think the written word is a format that is best for him.Personally I've found much more value in books such as:SAS Survival Handbook: How to Survive in the Wild, in Any Climate, on Land or at Sea. I was expecting something of this caliber when I purchased this book."
2,98.6 serves up lukewarm,"I had high hopes for this book but was very dismayed after reading it. Despite the author's attempt at over-the-top humor and cute buzzwords, much of the information seems derivative like it was cut and pasted from other survival books I've read before. Having worked as a lead instructor for many years for NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School), I was rather disappointed to see another book that will fill the reader with bad information. I would recommend Davenport's books on survival or any by Ray Mears- both of whom have real-life experience with the skills they write about."
3,"Buy the real book, not the Kindle version.","The info contained in this book wasn't bad, but it's painfully obvious that they didn't put a bit of thought into how the lists and illustrations would appear on a Kindle screen . The Kindle registers them as images, not text, so the resizing tool is useless.Unless you enjoy reading size 3 Arial, buy the physical book, not the Kindle edition."
4,I like this boor\k,"This book is unique in the sense that it brings the issue of survival to in a different perspective.The author's ability to make it ""real"" and personal makes for better reading than the typical sterileapproach."
4,Lundin's fine book focuses on a practical hierarchy of priorities,"I teach a brief segment on survival skills, and I completely rewrote my class outline after reading Lundin's book. Lundin explains why silly diagrams on building a figure four trap and a solar still do not add to survival skills, but core knowledge of the key priorities of shelter do.I'll give it four stars instead of five because there is some silly rhetoric in it irrelevant to the survival issue. But I recommend this book to anyone interest in practical advice."
1,"Terrible, do not waste your money.","This book is a complete waste of money, it does not offer any useful information to anyone who has even an ounce of common sense. It is boring and repetitive and does not seem to contain any useful information. I can't believe this is even a real book, it could of been summed up, probably more coherently, in a pamphlet. With all the positive reviews I decided to disregard the negative reviews and buy this book, what a mistake it was a bunch of drivel. I paid regular price for this but even if it was free I would not recommend it. There are better books out there, do not waste your time or money on this one."
4,Book order review,"The book was sent quickly and is in great shape, however there is a VERY STRONG tobacco smell that seems to be inbedded on the paper. Other then that all was well."
2,Science lessons,"the first half of the book goes over the science of stress physiology, physical and mental responses. Not really helpful unless you don't remember biology class from high school or college. I could be biased because I have a background in medical. The author is right, the book is not a traditional survival how to, so it is quite lacking in that aspect. I was hoping to experience Cody's specific techniques but what I got was an overall suggestion of be safe and positive when s*** hits the fan."
5,More important everyday.,"Cody has a light, easy to read style that keeps you attached and learning. He covers all of the basics in easy to understand terms. Glad I have it and hope to never need the information. Better to be prepaired and not need it, than to need it and not have it."
2,98.6 Degrees: The Art of Keeping Your Ass Alive,"The first thing you see is the publisher's terrible DTP. Huge font is another thing you might not like. As to contents, it's OK."
4,Good Tips,"This is a great book, there are a lot of tips and tricks, simple stuff you don't even think of. great illistration. i would recommend"
5,Excellent and must-have resource,"This book is entertianing, and easy read and (most importantly) full of good information. Cody Lundin has a great delivery and keeps things light-hearted and humorous while still driving the point home on the oh-so-important basics. This books has nothing but good knowledge, starting with how to avoid bad situations but teaching you how to be prepared for when you fail to avoid disaster. This book isnt just for the weekend warrior or the outdoors enthusiast... EVERYONE should read this book."
5,must read,cody lundin realy knows his stuf you have to check this book out it is the best read so i would say buy it ASAP.
1,"Unorganized, poorly written.","I found this books useless. There is much better books out there, even if you are a new beginner. In this book there is not any word about Java infrastructure of Oracle 8i, which is the main difference between Oracle 8i and Oracle 8. On the other hand, it tries to explain you some java related tools. No figures, charts or graphis of any sort to make the understanding easier. I could not find any correlation about how the authors organized the chapters and the chapters' contents. The author's style is very irratating as he continously praises Oracle. Oracle this, Oracle that..etc, without giving a solid information. Shortly this books is bad and do not waste your money. You can find better information in Oracle white papers or documentations which are free at technet.oracle.com and at oracle web site.If you are a new beginner, buy dummies series. Dan Hotka's Oracle Unleashed book is also very good for ever level of readers."
2,For total beginners,"This book is great for total beginners who have little to no experience with networks and databases. If you are looking for a general reference book, the book will be sufficient for basic stuff. For more complicated things like writing subqueries, inner joins, outer joins, stored procedures, creating data models and database administration, you should get a dedicated book. For professionals who want a good general reference book, a general purpose database administration book is a better bet. If you're used to GUI database administration, then get a good PLSQL book instead. There's no substitute for detailed knowledge and expertise with SQL and command line."
1,Useless book,The book is useless for people interested in Oracle 8i. The i part is less than 5% of the book. It's a generic discussion about Oracle and it's tools for very beginners.
4,I don't know what these people are thinking...,All I can say is this book is great to get a person up to speed with Oracle products. The portion of the book explaining all the parts that make up the Oracle package and the installation are worth the price alone.
2,Will not help you create your first Oracle Database...,"I am an absolute beginner in Oracle, and I was looking for a book that will show me step-by-step how to create and administer an Oracle database. This book will give you a little idea how to administer an Oracle database alright, but it is assuming you already have a database to administer!... Gladly, I just borrowed this book. Now I understand why the guy who lent it wasn't very happy with his purchase."
1,Don't waste you time and money,"I am totaly novice in Oracle DBA programing. When I bought this book I thought it would be a good place to start. Well, I was completely dissapointed. This book is neither for beginers nor for some who knows basic DBA programming. Today I returned it to the bookstore."
3,A Great Starting Point,I found it to be a pretty good overview of basic concepts; a decent book for someone with very little Oracle knowledge.
5,Court Shorties for tennis,"These ""shorties"" are worn under tennis dresses or skirts. I wanted a longer version because most on the market have a short inseam and ride up your leg when you're playing. This version is 4 inches leg length and they are perfect. Well worth every penny. If you purchase, be sure to look for the longer length as they also have a shorter version for the skinny-minnies out there."
3,"Has some good things to say, but delivery is less funny than serious, and delivery is rough","I liked a lot of what Brad Stine has to say. I agree with the politics.But to be fair, it feels like - as the audience - you are being yelled at for the entire act. His delivery is angry. It's polished, he's obviously very comfortable, but at times I felt it was almost oppressive listening.Some of it is actually funny. But it's not like say, Blue Collar Comedy, where you mostly just laugh your rear end off.I guess it depends on your cup of tea. I thought it was going to be more light-hearted than it is."
4,Funny,"Good clean fun. Some funny stuff, some silly. It's just ok, but compared to his worldly counterpart, he's outstanding."
4,Decent,"I had gotten this for my hamsters, so they had a stylish food plate, and I specifically gotten this one because the reviews had said that there wasn't a hole in it. Well the one I ordered has a hole in it, probably a good thing for other people though! Also, it appears that this plate/bowl had been used, you can see the water stains from past plants."
1,misrepresentation of God...,"This book is so untrue. God's wrath was poured out on Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago. His wrath has not been poured out since, nor will it ever be poured out until the Tribulation period when the Church is gone!Romans 2:4, ""It is the GOODNESS of God that leads man to repentence""!Jesus was not only the propitiation for our sins, but for the sins of the whole WORLD. (1 John 2:2)God is not angry at us!"
1,SAMPLES-NOT Travel packs,"This seller is misrepresenting this product-it is NOT a ""travel-sized"" item, they are sample packs. These are foil packs and are useless for travel as they can't be resealed."
4,Good Product,"This product is better than any other hair regrowth product I have tried. I was looking for was something to make my hair STOP falling out so much and this did the trick. I have yet to notice my hair becoming 'thicker', but the hair loss has slowed noticably, therefore, making my hair fuller and healthier just by not falling out so bad. The only reason I didn't rate this product with 5 stars is that it contains the ingredients Black Pepper and Cayenne. They tend to make acid indigestion worse. I avoid the irritation by taking it in the morning with breakfast and am not able to take the second recommended dose that would normally take place after my evening meal due to an already existing case of acid indegestion. It is a great product for hair."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I purchased this product because I am losing my hair due to PCOS. The pills were easy to take and didn't taste to bad but I did not notice any new hair growth while taking them, I took them for 2 months. I don't think they had any nutritional value, I would not recommend."
2,Didn't work for me...,"I am taking nuhair for 3 months, was very excited when i bought it, but unfortunally didn't work for me. I am losing a lot of hair still, and didn't see any change after i started taking nuhair regrowth. I am also using thinning hair serum by nuhair and i am very upset with the results too, nothing changed after 3 months :("
3,Not for me,I brought this for someone else and I think they like it a lot because they talked about the difference it made to their hair.
3,NuHair Regrowth Tablets for Women,It's still to early to tell if these tablets are working? I think my hair might feel better. But it's only been a couple of weeks. It says to give it 3 months.
3,"Works, but heartburn","There is black pepper extract and Cayenne pepper extract. I have to take it once a day, not 2x as recommeded with Prevacid and Zantac 150. I am going to have to stop using it."
3,nu hair vitamins,Ive been on these vitamins for almost 8 months and what I can say is that when I am taking them like I'm suppose to I didn't notice nearly as much hair shedding. I did notice lots of hair growth and quickly. Well now I've cut my hair and I miss is already so I have just a vitamins left but am anxiously waiting to see how quickly it grows back.
2,Very narrow target market-- and it's probably not you.,"Marty Cortinas, Beat the Odds: The Smart Player's Guide to Online Poker (Peachpit Press, 2006)This is, perhaps, a worthwhile book for the complete novice to online poker; if you don't know where the sites are, and are still learning your way around a computer, there's likely a lot to be gotten out of this. If you're already registered at a poker website, however, there's very little you're likely to find here that will be new. (I did learn about PokerTracker from the book, though, so I can't call it a total wash.)If you think a more advanced book would be right for you, it probably would. Flip through this one before putting out your hard-earned cash; you may already know everything to be found in it. **"
1,Not worth the time nor money,This is just a superficial book about online poker. It is neither worth the time nor money to buy. I have been playing online poker for a little over one month and I could write a better book than this.I was disappointed in the book.
2,Poor,"This was sold to me as a new tape. If it is, it's a very bad recording, looking as a copy of a copy, recorded in the slowest available speed.The audio, thus, is also not very good.It was also very expensive, ...But it was the only version I could find, though, and it's better than nothing."
3,Be Careful!!,This video only plays on our Mac. It will not play on our Blu-ray or other DVD player. It is a European pressing and is not compatible with regular US devices. The production is fine but if you don't want to watch it on your computer be very careful about ordering this DVD. I may have missed this qualification but I don't think it was mentioned on the product site.
5,Hurray the Lusty Month of May,"This 1975 version of Carmina Burana, filmed under the watchful eye of the composer is a pure delight. It is also a wonderful product of the time, that wears the era of the 70's well. The incredible voices of the youthful Hermann Prey, and the purely beautiful Lucia Popp is an especial treasure. The major players in the cast have now passed on, so to see them in this robust, lustful production is a treat. The direction of the great Jean Pierre Ponnelle adds spice to this irreverent play of medieval morals and manners, with graphic humor and exquisite technicolor; the height of cinematic color at the time. Carl Orff's use of profane texts demonstrate to us that our ancestors were full-blooded, truely human people, not just religious and filled with piety or mere drones of misery. Relax, enjoy and rejoice in the bumbling finesse of this great work, that introduced many of us to the the vast world of early music through modern composition."
2,jazz/folk good...soul/reggae weak,"This guy is a very good vocalist and a fine guitarist but the CD is a mixed bag. About half of it is a unique blend of jazz and folk. If the whole CD was like that it would be a keeper. Unfortunately, the other half is a mix of slick soul and some bad attempts at reggae."
5,Almost like bottled water,"Our water from the tap at work is horrible especially during the time of year they turn the lakes... almost unbearable to drink. I picked this up today and just started to use it and it's really very good!The only tip I would give to people is that if you load up the top section with ice before running water through it, HOLD the top before you pour this into a cup. It's a great thing to keep on your desk while at work."
5,Cult of Luna at their heaviest,"The Beyond, Cult of Luna's 2nd album, shows the band getting heavier as well as experimenting a bit more with sampling and novel use of textures. The spoken-word samples of Noam Chomsky definitely added an element of defiance and paranoia to CoL's already suffocating, dense sound.A lot of people compare CoL to Neurosis. I do think this is a fair comparison, as both bands play a type of dark, atmospheric metal influenced by hardcore punk. In many ways, this album compares favorably to Neurosis' ""Through Silver in Blood"", although this album relies a bit less on minimalism and repetition than Through Silver in Blood did. The Beyond is definitely a worthy addition to CoL's catalog."
3,"Good Scholarship, But Slow","There is a lot to unpack here (and many useful observations built on primary sources). However, it is a dense mission reading this book. The narrative structure doesn't make for light -- or, enjoyable -- reading. This book would work well in excerpted form for a college course."
3,"Informative book, but very SLOW reading","This book is an informative resource for gay history, or in the case of how this book presents it, gay discrimination and punishments. The book does not go into much detail about happy or positive things, and maybe that is how it was like in the past, but I can't believe that there were no positive relationships, activities, or events that went on despite the legal issues going on at the time. The book is slow reading and get's quite boring in some parts. Its a okay to good book, but its a lot to read."
4,Brewer's comprehensive book a good source for Buk lovers.,"Gay Brewer has written one of the most readable and useful books in the Twayne series. Bukowski, a prolific writer, has often been beyond the reach of critics, either because of the literary world's shunning of him, or because there just doesn't seem to be much more to say about poems & short stories which speak for themselves. Brewer gives a plain-spoken and useful critique of Buk's work, one which both scholars and the casual reader of Bukowksi will find useful."
1,An Irish Folktale that should not have been retold!,"I read this book before reading it to my little one and I am glad I did. Not only does it not have a positive message, it is a story of rewarded laziness and greed. And the message is not subtle either, it is all out there in the first line ..""Jamie O'Rourke was the laziest man in all of Ireland."" -- and he was still so at the end of the book -- and proud of it! The only decent aspect of the book are the illustrations which are very nice, but alas not enough to risk sending a totally wrong message to our children."
1,Fundamental inaccuracies.,"In all LSD research conducted, none have ever found LSD to be addictive in any fashion. Dependence to me, seems a non-issue. I do wonder if anyone has bought this.You wanna quit acid? go watch ereserhead or almost any david lynch movie while on the drug. A bad trip is usually your last trip, after which most people have no trouble quitting easily. There are no known withdrawl symptoms except continued effect for a few hours with higher doses. Patients feel ""back to normal"" within 24 hours in all cases I am aware of.This looks like a cheap attempt to peddle materials at blissfully unaware social workers and cut-rate psychotherapists."
4,Tight Jam:Pied Piper Production,this is the Jam. the comic spin cracks me up upon entering the Landryromat to wash your clothes. I can wash all my clothes to this Jam.you get your all Temperture Cheer or Tide out with some Clorex Bleech&wash them clothes. the video cracks me up because Nick Cannon is trying to keep up with Nivea's thick self. this song has a nice Groove&Feel. R.kelly can make you laugh but also make a Jam off something that is Important.gotta keep plenty of Quarters at the Local Landrymat. R.kelly&Nivea have cool Chemistry. you can Hang your clothes on the Line while playing this Jam.
3,"2 for 1, 1 for 2","This 2 for 1 DVD from Direct Source Label features Lamb with Liam Neeson and Arch of Triumph with Anthony Hopkins. The print of Lamb is fine--good video and sound quality. The print of Arch of Triumph is not as good--the color tends toward greens and reds, and the audio is a bit muffled, especially noticeable in the music score. If you want this product for Lamb, it's a good buy. If you want a good copy of Arch of Triumph, look elsewhere. All in all, 1 for 2."
5,Para todos los estudiantes de psicologia,"Despues de haber leido este libro, me he dado cuenta que es un libro que debe estar incluido en las lecturas diarias de todos los alumnos que estudien psicologia o de aquellos a los cuales les interese el psicoanalisis. Es un libro bastante claro y sintetico que permite obtener la información de manera rapida y concisa. Especialmente util para los alumnos que necesiten ahondar sus conocimientos acerca del tema. Cabe destacar el precio, que sin ser excesivo permite que cualquier persona se introduzca en los conceptos mas esenciales de esta rama de la psicologia."
1,NOT FOR MAC,"Never had a product that claimed to be compatible with Mac that is SO incompatible that it's a joke. Don't waste your money on this if you're using OSX. It's a truly lousy piece of equipment, and the software is terrible. I'm giving mine away."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC,"The Mac drivers for this scanner are faulty and unpredictable. Canon should be ashamed of this product, Do not buy this scanner if you have a Mac using OS X"
3,Lack of information about scanner,I have a Dell with only two USB ports. Using one for ethernet and the other for a Belkin 4 port USB hub for printer and digital camera. I was disappointed when I got the message that the LiDE 80 wouldn't work with a hub but had to be plugged directly into a USB port on the tower. I did not see any information about this in the product information I reviewed before I purchased the scanner. Now I must unplug the hub from the back of the tower and plug in the LiDE 80 before I can use it. A major inconvenience since the Dell tower is in a computer desk and has to be pulled out to reach the USB port.
4,Works well in Mac OS X 10.3.4 Panther,"I just bought this scanner for use with my G5 tower, and despite reading reviews to the contrary, it works brilliantly with OS X 10.3.4 - no problems whatsoever. I downloaded the latest CanoScan scanner driver (v7250) and CanoScan Toolbox (v4130) and within a few minutes of installing the software I was scanning with no problem at all. Scanner performs well considering its size, weight and one-cord convenience. This scanner should be ideal for all but the most demanding applications - highly recommended!"
4,2400 dpi mode,"For the money the Canon LiDE 80 is ideal for most users. The scanner will scan at 2400 dpi, but only in the mode the really matters, film (negative) and slide (positive) mode. The Canon LiDE 80 does this to prevent you from generating a large, and most of the time unnecessary file. For most users 300 to 600 dpi is all you need correctly digitize your image. If you want full control, you need to invest to the next level of scanners which will probably triple in price."
5,excellent scanner for everyday use,"This scanner was a replacement for a much bulkier model and I love it. The thin profile means I can slip it into my laptop bag and it powers off the USB port so there are no bulky power cords to worry about storing. I use this scanner mostly for photographs and negatives, though I am thinking of moving to an all digital archive because the scan quality on documents is so good.The software is easy to run and chock full of great features. I have a Canon digital camera as well so the photo editing software works well with my existing software. I highly recommend this scanner for ease of use and quality of output."
2,Terrible Negative Scanning,"I bought this thing to convert some of my negatives to digital. First off you have to use a clumsy Fare 2.0 module which plugs into the scanner and fits on top of the negative into the 35mm film adapter. This is not a good idea becuase you can only do one negative frame at a time. Also it doesnt seem to push down on the negative to make it flat. Negative scans are horrible, its comparable to a 1-2 mega pixel digital image.Regular photo scans are not to shabby. The image detail seems good enough but the color accuracy is off. Only thing saving the color is Photoshop Elements."
1,crap,"worked great for a few months, then never worked again. Wouldn't even power up. Wasn't worth it to try and return it since I bought it online. It literaly sat on a desk and was only used a few times and rarely even touched. Garbage hardware. Complete waste of money."
5,Excellent Scanner,This scanner is a wonder. Easy to use with idiot proof features. I love it - sorry I did not buy it sooner.
3,"Fine for flat stuff, but the film adapter is disappointing","I had an old Canon flatbed that gave up the ghost, so was looking forward to this new one, especially because it has a film adapter. First, and foremost, Canon's powering through the single USB cable is excellent and should be industry standard. However, it should be said that this is a film ONLY adapter - that is, it does NOT do slides (which seems like a bit of a bait; my bad for assuming, but the software does have the option of scanning positive film, so it seems like a important omission). More to the point, even when film strips/negatives are laid on the glass with the adapter, the results are slow, slow, slow and not very sharp. My suggestion: don't bother with the LiDE80 for film; just save$30 and get the LiDE65 for flatbed only. MacOSX interface is getting clunkier from generation to generation. Software bloat, I guess."
2,Not worth the money,"Pros: Small and compact. Powered through USB. Does great with 35mm negatives.Cons: Poor scan quality.I bought this scanner along with the Epson 2480 to test. Although tedious with scanning 35mm film, the color and scan quality is great. But for scanning pictures and other items, the scan and weak, and the color washed out (greens come out too yellow, blues much lighter in comparison with the 2480 which I would give 5 stars for scan quality). There is also a horizontal banding in the scans which is very noticable when the image is printed.I would recommend this only if you wanted to scan film and didn't really care to have a high quality scan of anything else."
1,Useless on New PCs,"I tried just plugging and playing with a 64 bit Windows 7 machine. The computer detected the scanner but it indicated ""troubleshooting required - device driver not installed."" I went to the Canon website to download the required driver, and they don't offer one for Windows 7 (x64). This is legacy equipment that can only be used on legacy computers. This device is useless to me and taking up valuable real estate. I wish I'd just ponied up for a new scanner and saved myself all this expense and hassle."
1,Not for Windows Vista,"It worked fine with XP.It worked fine with Vista, after three hours troubleshooting.It stopped working with Vista.It still works with XP.So if you have Vista and love a challenge, buy this one!"
2,Not my fave,I have many JGB and this is definitely not something I would recommend. I had a hard time even putting it on my iPod.
4,Great Christian Thinkers,This is an excellent collection of writings from the great Christian thinkers. It is a good book for the purpose of gaining a basic understanding of the various authors that are touched on but their complete works are not included.
5,A great encyclopedia of stitches!,Carolyn Christmas did a great job with this book. There are so many Tunisian stitches that are just beautiful. So many that you will never run out of a new stitch to try. Beautiful photo's of every stitch and easy to understand instructions! A+An absolute must have for your library!
4,Good foundation,"This book is an excellent resource for Tunisian stitches. It contains far more pattern stitches than general crochet dictionaries do. The color photographs clearly show what the finished stitches should look like; instructional photographs in the front of the book are less clear (yarn is too dark, photos are too small). I had to eliminate the extra chain at the beginning of some two-color patterns because it made the beginning too loopy. There is also no information about shaping--Tunisian crochet is too pretty to be limited to afghans and scarves!I used several of the stitches shown here for items in my book, ""Tunisian Crochet: The Look of Knitting with the Ease of Crocheting,"" which features 16 original designs. I include instructions for shaping Tunisian crochet to create sweaters and other garments.I encourage all crocheters to try Tunisian crochet for the beautiful effects it creates. This book is a worthwhile volume for reference and inspiration."
5,101 Tunisan Stitches,Easy to follow instructions and clear pictures. This is the closest to knitting I'll ever get.
4,available as PDF for less than $10,"I got this book from the library and liked it so much I wanted a copy. But the price was out of this world. I found a PDF version at Annie's Attic online for less than $10. It downloaded beautifully and is very nicely illustrated with color photos of stitch samples. The 3 main stitches (Tunisian Simple stitch, T. knit stitch and T. purl) are well illustrated and the remainder of the stitches have written instructions and color photos of stitch swatch. No patterns."
4,No Names For Stitches,"Like other reviewers have said, it is a great book, beautiful large pictures and clear instructions. Only the basic stitches are shown with their common names, the rest, a large majority of the stitches in the book, are only given numbers.It would be so much easier to look up a desired stitch in an index, by name, instead of going through all of the pictures. Also if you needed or wanted more information on an unnamed, numbered stitch, such as a pattern from another book or from online, it would be impossible to find it. That is the major flaw of this book. Otherwise I would have given it five stars.Hopefully if there is a future edition, the author will name the stitches."
3,MiMi,This book has a great variety of stitches. I've had problems with the instructions using non-standard terminology. On one occasion I needed to consult with a UTube video to clarify what to do.
1,Way over the top expensive,"OK, if it cost around $24 or less I would definately buy it. I barrowed a copy from a dear friend who was gracious enough to let me use hers. Yes, it was a good book. Yes, it had many neat stitch patterns.My biggest problem is it is currently $380+ dollars...What is driving the price up? I don't think it is close to being worth that much. There are no design patterns. You learn how to do a stitch, but if you want to make something other than an afghan you will have to figure it out on your own.I'm an experienced crocheter and have an extensive library but that one is unfortuanatly not in it. It won't be until the price comes down.Anyone know what is driving the price so high anyway?"
3,Good for what it is,"I have been crocheting for years but I have never made anything more than scarves and blankets. I thought this would be a fun book to try new stuff. Oops. It turns out that ""Tunisian"" is crocheting with a long needle and keeping the loops on the needle and not turning at the end of each row. (Confusing, I know)If you are experienced and know how to crochet this way, this is a great book. It has lots of ideas and stiches but you have to be able to read all the crochet short-hand."
2,Nuhair,"I don't know if these pills helpor not.I'm 57,I'm not bald justthinning mostly in the frontalareas of my head.I don't standin front of a mirror and counthairs.I think I'm just maintainingwhat I have."
1,Not effective,No complaints about the shipping or handling. Items arrived on time. Howver after using it for about 3 months (the DHT blocker and the Hair regrowth formula) I would say that I did not see any improvement.
1,nuhair,let me tell you a true about this pill .. these pills prevent from loosing hair but has side effect after one month i felt so voracious that was so bad and out of control I gained weight about 20 pond after three month ... i had to stop it after one month again my hairs start loosing i start taking nuhair again after 10 days i felt so hungry and very nerves i ate a lot but i did not feel full and my body was shivering and i start fighting with every body... i don't recommend this pill to anybody because has very side effect on nerves system and digestive system. do not wast your money .... if you don't believe me just try it one month ...good luck
2,Waste of money,Does not work . I try it and and I got ibecause I am losing hair alot and try this product did not help at all
4,Worth it.,"I didnt realize how well this product was working until I ran out. Almost immediatly I noticed more hair falling out in the shower, and left on my pillow. Not sure how much it helped ""re-grow"" hair, but it definitely kept it from falling out."
1,Wouldn't suggest this to anyone,"I tried it for a few months, it seemed as if it made my individual hairs thicker yes, but it seemed like it made them brittle as they started to fall out and break easier."
5,Lots of fun!,"I'm so glad Noggin decided to release a CD like this. My 2&1/2-year-old son (and his parents) love this show (now, if only they would come out with a Season 1 DVD).All lot of the best songs from the first season on this disc. Only complaint is that there aren't more songs from the Schwartman Quartet and other performers. C'mon, Laurie Bernker has her own line of discs, give some others a chance.If you like JBMS, check out this disc (it's the first thing my son asks for when we get in the car)."
2,Not worth it,"We like Laurie, but I wasn't impressed with this CD. My kids (3 and 5) asked me to skip most of the songs every time we listened to it, and I was happy to oblige. The Laurie songs on here were enjoyable, but we can get those (and more) on her own cds. Of the other songs on the cd, really the ones we wanted to hear were the Grumpy song and I Like It That Way. Everything else was inane (even to the kids) and several were done in the voices of Mel, Mary, etc., which we found to be grating (it's different when you're watching them act it out on tv...just LISTENING to those voices is not very enjoyable....familiar, but actually irritating)! I know this review is different than most about this cd, so take it for what it's worth, but see if your local library has this before you plunk down the money for it. I'm glad we tried it at the library first! On another note, we'd highly recommend Dan Zanes, Brady Rymer, Justin Roberts, and maybe Ralphs World, too."
3,Could of been more but not bad,There are tons of more songs they could of put on this cd. Most kids that love the show probably already have the Laurie Berkner CDs so that's a bit of overkill. My biggest disappointment was not one Cathy Richardson song was on it and she's the one my son loves the most. Still he does enjoy it.
4,My 15 month old loves this CD!!,We are fans of the show so when I saw this on-line I decided to purchase it for my daughter. It was love at first listen. We play it everyday for her! She bops to the music and gets excited when she sees me go near the CD player. Even our eight year old son sings along. The songs are infectious in the best way. A great purchase.
5,A classic collectible for my granddaughter!,"When McDonald's gave away miniature Madame Alexander dolls in their Happy Meals, I told my (then) 8-year-old granddaughter how the slightly larger Madame Alexander dolls were somewhat expensive collectibles and that I'd had one as a child. Immediately she wanted one. This one was such a good buy and so adorable. I am pleased to say that 2 years later she still has the complete set and displays it in her room. It took a lot of restraint for that little girl not to dress and play with the doll and I wouldn't have cared if she did. But I am proud of her for understanding that this isn't REALLY a toy."
4,Best non fiction,"This is the best non fiction book I have read in the last 15 years. Informativie,fascinating and it clarified questions encountered during my travels in the Navy. It has reinforced my own beliefs."
4,Revealing,I just browsed thru the book at a library. It appears to be well researched and shows the uniqueness of each religion. It makes one want to experience the different religions. I will be happy to write more after I fully read the book.
1,TIPICAL FROM A TIPICALLY LIBERAL UNIVERSITY PROFFESOR!,"I can't add much to what some very sharp reviewers have already said here. Eck seems to be looking at all religions thru rose colored glasses. She is either ignoring the glaring truth or she is naive in the extreme. But what can we expect from the liberal left that embraces ""DIVERSITY"" as their mantra!"
3,Interesting... could have been better,"The positives of this book is its reminder of how we have evolved as a nation. Yes, for the most part we have serious Judeo Christian roots, but lets not forget that many of the founding fathers were more deists than anything. Historians have written since the early years of Christians, Jews, native American belief systems. What is lacking in the book is a serious discussion on the negatives of some of the newer belief systems, and the lack any appreciation of freedom for anyone other than themselves. Freedom of religion in our constitutional documents, has freedom in them for a reason."
4,Great Read,One of the first books about religion that I truly enjoy reading. Eck has a lot of good experience and insight to share.
2,Could Have Been A Great Book,"Eck writes what was could have been a great book about a very important subject. She has a great deal of background in this area, and reminds you of this background throughout the entire book. It is filled with stories of her travels, and her extremely one sided arguements. Although she makes some great points, the stories are overabundant, and the book is completely redundant. If you read the prelogue, and the first chapter of each of the three sections (Islam, Hindu, and Buddhism) then you will be able to answer any question someone asks you of the entire book, yes it is that redundant. If you enjoy reading the same thing in a book more than 15 times this is the book for you, but if you are on an actual search for knowlege and want to learn something without bias, look elsewhere."
2,Could have been much better,"This was one of the texts that was required for a world religions class that I am taking this semester. There is no doubt that the author is passionate about her subject, but the book never made the leap from identifying the problem (over and over again) to making an argument for concrete solutions. The material she presented could have been shared in one hundred pages instead of four hundred pages and said the same thing."
3,"Interesting, but needed an editor","While this book is brimming with fascinating history, anecdotes and facts about immigration and religion in the U.S., it is bogged down in repetition. Ms. Eck repeats her central thesis and numerous feel-good phrases ad nauseum. The first two chapters should have been condensed into one. Otherwise good reading for those interested in fostering mutual understanding and a strong civic union in an increasingly pluralistic society. Bit surprised that Harvard couldn't do a better job on editing."
4,Same as Garmin,I have the Garmin equivalent as well as this. Both are good and both give the the same number of bars boost vs using the GPS in the interior. I rated it 4 instead of 5 because their promotional material claims it to be superior to Garmin and it is just as good but not better. Just buy the cheapest of the two.
1,Weak connector - broke after using for 2 weeks. Can't get it repaired.,"The connector to attach the antenna wire to the Garmin unit is very weak. It broke within about 2 weeks of use. I'm unable to get it repaired.Low profile external GPS Antenna for Garmin Quest, StreetPilot o320 c330 i3 i5 2720 2730 2610 2620 iQue 3200 3600 M5 PDA, GPSMap 60 60C 60CS 76 76C 76CS Quest Quest 2 with Straight Connector (MCX-180)"
4,Garmin compatible antenna.,Works great on my Garmin Quest! Needed something like this because the built-in flip-up antenna stopped working. Much better sensitvity than when the flip-up antenna was working ok. Delivery was fast and problem-free.
2,Pediatric pathology,"This book is somewhat improved from the previous edition, but the very poor illustration quality and many typographical errors detract greatly from its overall quality. Unfortunately, this is the standard text in the field. A suitable competitor is sorely needed."
4,Crazy woman!,"This is a read if you like true crimes! Well written with attention to details. Hard to believe someone could be so vicious, especially to her own children and those that loved her. This woman was truely manipulative in every way. Cold hearted to say the least."
4,SHE WANTED IT ALL,"SHE WANTED IT ALL. THIS IS A GOOD BOOK. READING IS MY FIRST LOVE. I ALSO LOVE MY KINDLE, IT IS SO EASY TO READ. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES READING."
4,There's Lessons To Be Learned Here,"The story is well-written. There's plenty of history behind the character. Celeste manages to charm almost everyone that meets her, but ultimately those people pay the price. Most were lucky, they didn't pay with their lives. I was amazed how some people can be so nave and continue their relationship with Celeste when they already saw some red flags. Celeste had a talent for preying on people's weaknesses."
4,she wanted it all,"The book definitely held my interest and I did not want to put it down. However, I thought things were repeated and the story could have been told with less words."
5,I couldn't put it down.,Another great book. Only the second of Kathryn Casey's book that I have read. It was difficult for me to imagine anyone so selfish as Celeste willing to kill her husband for material gains - but I guess it happens so often. This book took you into the minds of those connected. I truly enjoyed it.
4,"The true ""Gold Digger""","A great book. Could there ever have been a more accurate portrait of a true-blue gold digger? Why some women (and men) feel a sense of entitlement to the money/property of others simply because they are (or were) married to a financially successful person is beyond me! You want money? WORK for it! Some lazy people would rather marry for it -- or kill for it! Great book. I felt so bad for Steve's family. They were helpless and had to sit by while Celeste planned, plotted and executed her plan to murder Steve -- all for the money. What a shame. Kathryn Casey is a great writer. I used to be hooked on Ann Rule, but got tired of her ""Series"" books. Now, I'm going to be looking for more stories written by Ms. Casey. She did a wonderful job of showing what a shallow and callous gold-digger Celeste really was."
5,Interesting Story!!,"I had heard about this particular story before from t.v. shows, but it was great to get an even more in-depth view of all the events that surrounded the story of Celeste Beard and her involvement with the murder of her elderly husband. The story has all the benchmarks of a great Hollywood movie, and what's best?...It's a true story, filled with sex, lies, drugs, and murder.Excellent read, and I definately recommend this book to anyone who enjoys true crime."
1,proscutor wrong again in this case THE PROCUTING ATTOURNEY SHOULD BE LOCKED UP NOT celeste,Her LESBIAN LOVER did this all by herself the child in this case lied through her teeth to get her hand on the mony fortune to herself and the lesbian lover was promised some too.The lesbian lover of celest wanted celest all to herself because of the money.
5,Absolutely fascinating,"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. Kathryn Casey is an extremely talented writer and she has put together a fascinating account of a beautiful, charming sociopath who ruined the life of everyone who loved her. Like many sociopaths, Celeste Beard has an uncanny ability to hone in on psychologically fragile people and to exploit their vulnerabilities for her own ends. A pathological liar and accomplished actress, she was even able to manipulate and fool psychiatrists and other mental-health professionals. This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in true crime."
4,Study guide to accompany a short history of western civiliza,It was a very helpful resource for the parent book. It outlined key points and important issues that were discussed in the text. This valuable book was key in helping me gain a more complete knowledge of western culture and civilization.
2,ok,didn't really see a change in glare with the glasses. found that placing glare screen on monitor helped most.
1,NO,NO ES LO QUE DICE DE NOCHE SE VE IGUAL DE DÍA SI CUBRE UN POCOLA LUZ SOLAR NO QUEDE CONTENTO PERDÍ MI DINERO NO LO RECOMIENDO
5,September Psalm,"My mom bought me this CD when it was first released. I found it to be very soothing and calming. Somehow, over the years, I lost it. Needed it. Ordered it from Amazon. It is very calming when you are tired and weary. Will never lose it again."
5,No Jive -MC5!,Like real rock? Like loud rock? Wanna hear how it's really suppose to sound/feel? GET THIS DISC!!!!! TELL YER FRIENDZ TO GET IT TOO!! If your ever gonna wanna REALLY rock this is the only thing you will ever need. I've been listening to the MC5 every day of my life since '69. Why haven't you?
4,Rock N Roll,"I love this CD. This is real Rock N Roll. It's all I need when driving down the interstate on a hot summer day. If you're a casual MC5 fan, this is the only CD you really need to kick out the jams."
5,great bag,"I was very apprehensive about buying a new bag since I had had my previous messenger bag for about 4 years and had grown quite attached to it. However, I am very very glad that I ended up buying this one. It's a very sturdy bag that has thus far been quite water resistant. It is perfectly sized for my laptop (lenovo T420) although I have not tried using it yet with more than just a laptop, charger, and a few papers and ipod and headphones and such. The waterbottle holders on both sides is a nice touch and the shoulder strap is quite comfortable. All in all, I'd say this a great messenger bag and I highly recommend it"
5,Osprey Astro review,"This is an excellent bag for my needs (commuting to school). The capacity is much larger than it seems at first glance, and I love having all the pockets to organize my stuff - it's particularly nice having one (big) pocket on the outside flap, for things I want quick access to without opening the whole bag. The laptop sleeve fits my computer perfectly (a 15' MacBook Pro), and the back zipper to get the computer out quickly is a nice touch. The elastic flap also allows me to lash down something like an extra jacket, on days with changeable weather."
2,Good organization and comfort but carrying handle weak,"I loved this bag for its size and organization. I was using for work. But I carried it by the hand grip and the recycled fabric handle started to fray after a week. If you use the shoulder strap all the time. It would be fine, I think."
1,Junk,"I had a couple of these when I was a kid,and both of them were total crap.The first one I had,the head broke off,and the second one's belt broke for absolutley no reason at all.After the two very bad incidents with this action figure,my parents started to buy me the Kenner Batman Dark Knight Collection action figures instead.Those were alot cooler looking,and WAY more durable than this little piece of plastic junk.If you're a collector,I recommend you get those.They were made for Batman(1989) and Batman Returns(1992).Although,they weren't released until 1990,about a year after the original Tim Burton movie came out."
5,Cool evening recording,"Cool, early evening, recording without a lot of audience noise. She was really on that night!"
2,Was expecting more,"This artist has had so much hype in the jazz press that I was prepared to be blown away. I wasn't. Her voice is fine but I felt sung ""at"" not sung ""to."" Her scatting is more on the order of noodling and she doesn't seem to like to state the melodies before she abstracts them. The whole appraoch seems contrived, unnatural and over the top. After getting this ""live"" CD I actually went to see her live and the whole first set she only sang 3 songs and most of it was mediocre soloing from her band while she ooohed and aaahed and strutted and posed while listening to them. Different strokes, I suppose, but I was completely underwhelmed and left mid-show, as did lots of others in the audience. Maybe it was a bad day for her. This CD was better than the show for sure. I'd give her another chance but not for awhile!"
1,Factual but lacking in content and overall design concepts,"Overall, the book contains (and looks like reprints) of details that are available via Microsoft's MSDN library. While this is useful for non-MSDN subscribers, neither source is comprehensive in describing the actual setup, use and practical examples. Actual syntax of commands and functionality is missing - appendices are unclear and effectively describe what the term means - not how it's used nor it's options. This is definitely NOT a step-by-step book. After reading, I found I had more knowledge about the product, but was still unable to effectively set it up. Am still seeking other sources. I do not recommend this book for anyone attempting a functional use."
1,No real help or insight,If your looking for insight or help in setting up or implementing the index server this book offers no help. I was highly disappointed in what this book has to offer.
2,Not much help if you've read the manual,"The first 60 pages describes downloading, installation and questions like ""What is Microsoft Index Server"". I bought the book to learn more about META-tags, hidded keywords and similar. Not a word about it."
3,Important Topic Area Not Covered,"Overall this is a nice, neat, small, coherent, and potentially useful little volume. It seems to cover most of what one might need to know to make good use of Microsoft Index Server--with one glaring exception. I bought this book hoping to learn about searching on META tag contents, which I was having trouble understanding. For example I wanted to be able to search on the META tag contents for the META tags AUTHOR, KEYWORDS, SUBJECT, and DESCRIPTION. I was surprised and disappointed that I could find no reference to any of these topics in the index of the book, and I could not find them in the body fo the book either: META, META tag, @DocAuthor, @DocTitle, @DocKeywords, DESCRIPTION, AUTHOR, KEYRWORDS, or SUBJECT. I think you could read this book and not know that it is possible to search on the contents of some META tags. That's why I gave the book a 5; otherwise I would have given it about an 8."
3,Tom Petty Urges Peace,"This CD came out to urge the halting of the 1992 LA Riots. To me, it was ingenious of Tom Petty and his band to come out with this song to calm down the anger of the initial Rodney King verdict. Even for those who didn't know the premise that caused Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers to record this song, it would still be revered because of its sound and message."
2,Awful. Just awful.,"A bit of poorly thunk out political grandstanding by a man who, up until that point, had made few missteps. The beginning of Petty's slide into a period in his career (not unlike Aerosmith) who tried everything but good music to ""get over with the kids."" The only attractive thing about ""peace"" is that it is rare. The most amazing thing about is the chutzpah it took Petty to believe that his breezy, southern tunes would calm an inner city riot. He never sounded more out of touch than on this single."
4,Coaching Youth Wrestling,Well illustrated introduction for coaches new to youth wrestling and its special requirements. Excellent selection of excercises again well illustrated. Must reading for annyone taking on the daunting task of building a winning youth club or team.
1,Faded after 1 wash,This comforter set was beautiful when I bought it but after the first wash it faded in some places and the filling bunched up in the corners!! Very disappointed as this product was not cheap!!
5,This is a wonderful product for contact users. ...,This is a wonderful product for contact users. Many times saline drops are needed for dryness in the eyes. I used this product rather than saline drops and it was equally effective.
5,The Refresh Contacts Contact Lens Comfort Drops worked ...,"The Refresh Contacts Contact Lens Comfort Drops worked like a charm. I really put it to the test when my family and I spent a day at the zoo. The day was hot and sunny, and after a few hours my contacts began to irritate my eyes. I'd brought along the Refresh Contacts solution in anticipation. With my lenses on my eyes, I applied two drops to each eye. The solution began to soothe my eyes immediately. Throughout the day, I applied the drops three times. By the end of the day, my eyes still felt fine and I was able to wear my contacts into the evening. From now on, this product will be a part of my day-trip survival kit!"
4,This is a great product for contact lens ...,This is a great product for contact lens wearers. It keeps my eyes moist without irritating them further. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wears contacts and has a problem with dry eyes.
4,I really enjoyed Test Driving Refresh Contact Lens ...,"I really enjoyed Test Driving Refresh Contact Lens Comfort Drops. I've had trouble with allergies this summer, and the Refresh drops really made my eyes feel better. I appreciate the fact that this product can be used with contact lenses -- no need to remove my lenses like other products suggest. Also, I can use this product right before I insert my contacts. I've already recommended this product to my friends and family."
3,I really liked the way these eye drops ...,"I really liked the way these eye drops made my eyes feel right after putting them in, but soon after that my eyes kept getting really dry (much dryer than before I tried the drops). It made me want to put more drops in my eyes. I wouldn't recommend these eye drops because of this."
2,Be warned not 1.9 GHZ!,"One warning: this is a ""Model 1900"" but it is not 1900 MHZ. No it is 1600 MHZ. How do they get away with this? Beats me. Now for that price 1600 MHZ is a good deal, but I hate deceptive advertising."
3,Iverson V Basketball Shoe Review,"This is a fair performing shoe for basketball players. The shoe itself is a little clunky and not very responsive to quick cuts. It should be worn if you are playing at the guard positions; heavier players should definitely stay away from this shoe, because there is not enough cushioning and support for their weight. Overall, it's a fair shoe and very reasonably priced."
5,Very Comfortable,"Use this pad for sleeping on a cot, fits the cot perfectly and is very comfortable. Very easy to setup and breakdown. Watch the video that is on the product page. Shows how simple it is. Comes with carrying bag and straps that make it very easy to transport. Might be a little too heavy for backpacking, but it rolls up to the same size as my thermarest ridgecrest."
3,not comfortable,"We purchased these to use on high quality cots. They are not comfortable and in order to even sleep on them we have to let 1/2 the air out. They do, however, inflate easily, deflating is another issue, it takes 2 people to push the air out. I would not recommend these mats to anyone. The price was very high which I guess led me to assume they would be comfortable. If I had a way to ship them back to seller I would."
5,Taste good!,These are the best tasting protein bars I've ever had. They are my favorite. I have been buying them for years and I still like them. They are a great way to get some protein and energy quick. Especially when you are building muscle.
2,Surpisingly Disappointed,"I purchased these protein bars to save money from the price I normally pay for them. They came from Amazon and not a third party seller. This was my first time ordering from Amazon and was disappointed in this item only! Unfortunately, they were extremely stale. I looked at the expiration date on the product and it was fine, however, I think these items were frozen and thawed out or they sat in a very warm area of a warehouse and dried out beyond tastefullness! I had a few other people who always eat these try them and they said they were not good AT ALL! I will not order food type items from you again, but will definitely keep shopping at Amazon.com. It's great otherwise! Keep up the good work on your prices, items and service. I would take a look at your food storage though."
1,"Misleading label, not acceptable","This product contains large amounts of sugar alcohol as 'maltitol syrup'. This is not disclosed on the nutrition label, and is omitted completely from the list of ingredients shown on the Amazon.com site, even though it appears on the bar ingredents label.If you have a bad reaction to the laxative maltitol beware, you will get very sick eating this product."
3,"Not very tasty, but good protein content","I wanted some extra protein for my workouts. Saw these on a gold box special at a great price and I bought them. I really don't like the taste, compared to other high protein bars I have tried, but they had great nutritional benefits. I would not buy these again though, due to the taste for me."
4,Power Lunches,This is a reasonably good enough power bar for those times when you can't eat a real meal. Good texture and satisfying.
2,pepsi1,"Not so hot a bar. Have tried different flavors of the same. Slight chalky taste. Just in general, I don't think they have near the taste of something like Clif Bar Builder's Bars."
2,Flaky!,"Perhaps I just got a bad batch, but...it's a real pain to rely on a convenience food for quick nutrition in a fast lifestyle that winds up dropping flakes of chocolate coating all over the place. At almost $2 a bar, this is inexcusable."
4,Great product!,"These are my new favorite protein bars. I've struggled a lot with getting enough protein in my diet, but I typically find protein bars to be way too dry, with a weird aftertaste. This bar is great! It is super moist, tastes fine (I wish it was a little more peanut buttery tasting), and no weird aftertaste. It can be a full meal replacement given the calories/protein for those of us with lower caloric needs, so I usually eat half. Definitely tops my old favorite protein bars (Luna - which are fine, but less good than this)."
4,Good but . . .,"I have used the Chocolate PowerBar from a grocery and think it is a great product: highly recommended. The carton of them I got through the mail are basically OK, but seem to be slightly stale, a problem not encountered with the grocery-store purchases."
1,Taste horrible,I hate the way it taste... I got the choco crisp one and it tastes very artificial; I definitely suggest you not to get that flavor...
2,stale,These boxes of power bars expire 12/21/2011. As a result they taste somewhat stale. The reason why I buy this particular flavor is due to the taste. I recommend you don't sell any more bars whose expiration date is within 6 months.
1,Power Bars,Never received the item. I ordered a pack of chocolate peanut butter power bars through amazon and was very disappointed. I will think twice before ordering items again. Hope this is helpful.
2,Not The Same Product!!!!!!,The item I received was their new 'Vanilla' PowerBar ProteinPlus. The Vanilla Yogurt bars are being discontinued. I did not enjoy these new bars very much. They are much too sweet for my taste.
2,"Natural? Maybe, but certainly not what you think.","Tom's products really seem misleading. They label them ""Natural"" which leads people to believe they are getting a healthier product - which isn't always the case.Thats the case with most of Tom's products. This toothpaste for example only has the natural label because it doesn't contain artificial sweeteners and color.Be advised, this toothpaste contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a known irritant and carcinogen. Something that every single other natural toothpaste won't have in it. SLS causes canker/cold sores, and is readily absorbed in the mucus membranes of the mouth.Find an alternative, this isn't really much better than normal cheap mass marketed toothpaste."
3,Be careful,"This item is OK. Only try to not tighten a lot while mounting on a truss or a stand, otherwise you would risk to damage their material and/or paint. (imo, they should include some kinda plastic protection for the end of screw touching the metal). Neither leave it too loose to avoid a fixture drop risk. So you need to tighten just moderately.Other than that, item is as described and does what it is intending to do."
4,Good clamp for the job,"Most of my fixtures are LEDs or Aluminum these days, so these small, lightweight clamps do the job fine. I would not recommend them for steel par cans but they work good on most everything else I use."
2,"Cool design, Cool topic","This is book full of cool pictures of cool cars. I really like these early roadsters, so I buy everything I can about them. I have to agree with the other review, though, the writing in this really is bad. There are so many cool pictures, though, that they make up for the writing. If you like roadsters and already know a good deal about them, buy the book. If you are a first timer looking for an introduction to the history, this one probably isn't for you."
5,Kurtis - the Indy Legend,"A beautifully manufactured book chronicling the career of a unique, self taught, instinctive race car designer and builder. Frank Kurtis' creations have been long time favorites of mine, and this book very thoroughly recounts the production history of his distinctive automobiles. It also provides insight into the resourcefulness that kept his family and business afloat during harder times. Highly recommended."
5,The best summary of Seismology since Richter,"Bullen and Bolt write a book which is small, but packed with information. This is a good reference book to carry with you in the field or to stock on your overcrowded shelf."
1,Horrible Don't Buy,"No index, and the functions are in a type face that makes it impossible to quickly scan the book. What it explains is not detailed enough to do you much good.Just say no to this book."
2,Order,"My biggest complaint with this book is that functions are listed in categories instead of alphabetical. The one thing I love about the Programming Perl book is I can flip right to the page I want and see the syntax, examples, etc. of a function. With this book here I am spending 5 minutes trying to find the entry for the function. By that time I could have gone to php.net and found the info there."
2,"List of functions, but wheres the beef?","Like many others are saying about this book it has two major flaws, the first is that it lacks an index, while it does have a table of contents, if you need to look up a specific command you can't. The second, and more important, problem is that this book doesn't describe the functions in a usable fashion. In fact the printing of the function is sometimes longer than the description itself, they rarely go beyond 5 words. While some functions do not need a lengthy explanation, others do. This book isn't all bad, earlier on it does explain (in full sentences/paragraphs, wow!) about form handling, database integration, variables, bolean, and the basics like while/do and if/then. Like every other O'Reilly pocket reference, these mini books are only good as a reference, not as a sole learning tool so if you purchase this book, I sure hope you bought a full sized PHP book."
1,What a disappointment,"Don't buy this book; you won't use it. The function explanations are rarely more than a sentence, and worst of all they are many times self-referential.""string urlencode(string str) - URL-ecodes a string."" The function name makes that clear, but what does that mean, if you don't already know? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of referring to a book for clarification?""array pathinfo(string path) - Returns information about a certain string."" Does that description clarify anything beyond the function name?They should have trimmed out more functions and included more information about the most important ones. Sadly, this is also the book used in Dreamweaver MX 2004 for online help, which is frustrating."
2,Why is O'Reilly still offering this?,"I just bought this and I guess I should have been more diligent at looking at the description. Seeing 2nd edition I was thinking this covered PHP 5, but it was last released in 2002 and it now covers PHP 4. Book is somewhat useful I guess but why are they still asking $10 for such an out dated book, especially a tech book whose active shelf lives rarely last more than three or four years.Publisher really needs to get this updated to at least cover PHP 5. Of course by the time they release it PHP 6 will probably be the norm."
4,"Short Review of ""PHP Pocket Reference"", 2nd Edition","This is a very good small concise reference to PHP 4. Most of the book consists of a summary of the basics of the PHP language plus a function reference to about 1400 PHP functions. If you are in need of a handy reference to PHP 4, this pocket reference would be an excellent companion for ""Programming PHP"" (which is a fuller reference to PHP and is also published by O'Reilly).I would not get this pocket reference unless you are already somewhat familiar with PHP and already own ""Programming PHP"" (or rough equivalent). This book, though well written, is not designed as an introduction to PHP. Oh, and you need to be OK with it not covering PHP 5.If you want more detail, you could take a look at my somewhat longer review on the Oakland Perl Mongers site.George Woolley of Oakland.pm and Camelot.pm"
3,Not for Learning Basics,"Aside from the fact that this book is now outdated I must disagree with the Editorial Review that says ""This small book acts as a perfect tutorial for learning the basics of developing Web applications with PHP.""For someone who has never used PHP before (unless perhaps they are an experienced programmer) this would not be a good starting point. It is strictly a reference for those who already have some knowledge and experience with PHP and for that it is very good.Anyone who has O'Reilly's ""Webmaster in a Nutshell"", 2nd Edition does not need this book as it is the same as Nutshell's section on PHP."
2,"He may have written PHP, but...","...if this is the best technical writing he can do, I understand why people complain of a lack of PHP documentation. This book is 90-some percent a list of PHP functions and their input and output types. However, it fails to give indication of what any function does, what the input means to the function, or what the output means to you. The rest of the book is a very basic PHP overview which states about twice a page that if you want any real information you need to visit the Web site. I can still see a use for this book, despite its utter lack of information: if you already use PHP and you know programming in general and you have a good idea of what kind of function you need but have no idea what it's named in PHP and don't want to spend hours on end trudging through the online manual, you can use the book to flip through function names 'til you find one that looks like it may be what you want, then search for that function online and see if it is."
3,Not a good format for a scripting tool reference.,"I disagree with the reviewer who said this book is lacking an index. This book *is* an index, and not a terribly helpful one.A Nutshell-type book makes more sense for a robust scripting tool. PHP is not a trivial or admin-oriented language; if you want to sell *any* reader on its virtues, you have to show what the language can do.As a co-author of the The Java 2 Certification Study Guide, I can tell you exactly what readers think of a list of calls in print -- we used to have 200+ pages of that in the back of our book. Anyone who had anything to say about it called it filler, and they were right.Make a PHP Nutshell book, and get someone like Flanagan to write it. Believe me, we'll buy it. Admittedly,I wasn't expecting a whole lot more than I got for the price of this book. But when an info-holic has a book he won't crack twice on a long plane ride, something's wrong with the book. :-)"
3,Maybe?,"This book would be great, if it had an index. The book does have a TOC, but it doesn't help find specific commands or functions. This book is only good for a reference on PHP. They do explain a couple of things, but not enough to use this book specifically as a learning tool. If you are looking to learn PHP buy ""PHP Fast and Easy Web Development. I bought it and it is a great book for someone that wants to learn all of PHP."
3,"A good reference, no more no less.","Honestly if you are looking into buying this book take a look at O'Reilly's ""Webmaster in a nutshell"" before you buy this. The information in here is pretty much a repeat of everything in there, only the Webmaster book contains a lot more valuable and exstensive knowlege base in regards to not just PHP. If you just want a simple, small reference with information that is readily available for free on the web then you may find this useful, otherwise don't bother. I have to give it some credit because the book dosen't claim to be any more than it is and it is pretty inexpensive."
3,Good reference for experienced programmer,"This book is really nothing but the online PHP manual in book form without the code snippet examples for each function. You would get more info by just printing out the online manual, but if you use an inkjet printer that might be more expensive than the book!"
1,It worth's nothing without an index!,"If I knew it has no index (except from chapter 1) I wouldn't buy it for my Kindle!For me, it was supposed to be a reference and cannot be so as long as there is no index on it.I wish O'Reilly or Amazon will provide a solution for this."
3,No index! Argh!,"It's been said by prior reviewers, but just in case you missed it: This book has no index.ORA should put out PHP In A Nutshell, rather than just PHP Pocket Reference."
4,Buku yang Sangat Menyentuh,Buku ini sungguh luar biasa. Saya telah membacanya beberapa kali dan tetap amat menyentuh.Buku amat menolong kita dalam proses menghayati makna Natal di tengah kondisi perayaan Natal yang sering kali kehilangan makna karena nilai-nilai komersial.Saya merekomendasikan buku ini untuk Anda dan keluarga!
4,Christmas Stories for the Heart; Rekindle the Warmth,"This will be simple, but I read several of the stories and they really touched my heart. They were sincere and very focused on the love and meaning of the Christmas season and on what Christmas is all about."
4,Tugged on my heart,I had tears in my eyes while reading most of this book and will purchase additional copies now so that I have them as gifts for next Christmas season. This is a great collection of stories.Diane Z.
3,"Good Stories, Poor Design","The stories in this collection are lovely, but are printed in pale green ink on pages that appear to have a pale green tint. Also, the type size is small--only about eight points in some cases. I worked as an editor for thirty years, and question these design choices, as they make for difficult reading."
2,A whole lot of fluff and a little bit of information!,"While this has the potential to be a decent series, it bombards you with advertising for itself constantly. Presented in a 6 week study format, even from the ""scence selection"" option it forces you to watch, yet again, a commercial-like introduction for the Deeper Connections series. After getting through 4 weeks of this, and all of us knowing the theme song in the commercial, we had enough and banished it to the closet and started in on a new Rob Bell video.If you can make it though the commercials weekly, you then get to listen to a dramatic reading of the scripture, followed by some decent reflections from different theologians. The content isn't that bad but probably only amounts to about 40% of the actual DVD, the rest is just fluff!By the way, if you haven't tried Rob Bell, he's great! We always have the most people in attendance when we announce that we will be using his DVD's."
1,Order to Receiving was Unreasonably Long,This item was ordered on December 14th and didn't ship until December 21st. I received it on December 26th. I would use caution when ordering from this site if you expect your order in a reasonable time frame.
4,Good idea for small budget.,"Each project is relatively simple to build and well described by step by step intructions.Each step is illustrated by a picture.Most are based on using MDF or MPB and simple hardware which make it perfect for the budget limited hobyist.Every project have measurement both in inches and centimeters.I would have given it 5 starts if I didn't face a problem while building the router table due to some missing explanation. However, I sent an email to the author and received an answer promptly."
4,Very practical - Sound building techniques,"A sound and sensible approach to building workstations for your shop. If you have the perspective (as I do) that workstations are inthemselves ""tools"", you will find this book valuable."
3,"""I use a very informal Writing Style"" Schultz said.","That is not the problem. The problem is that the autor is not precise. Many of the calculations are experimentaly made or don't match reality.I haven`t finished to read the book and I have found unconcluded text in at least two pages.On the other hand, the book is a good guide and give you some tips that are dificult to find in other place."
2,8051 Programming@#$^,"One of the most confusing, unhelpful books on C programming for microcontrolers. The examples are ambigious and just plane impossible to decipher"
4,"Great product, overnight shipping not so overnight","Product is great, and a good read. However, I ordered overnight shipping in mid morning and did not receive it until 2 days later."
2,Misleaded,"I should've listened to my instinct and moved on to another CD, but instead listened to my friend....This album did not do anything for me...Too bad it cost me $17 in 1998. I tried to trade it and they didn't want it....hmm.I give it two stars, one for the effort with another label and another for the artwork."
3,SHOULD NOT BE HATED ON,"Although people say it is a bad CD, this is still pretty good. This is Snoop's first No Limit release and it has some bangin' tracks. I admit, some guest appearances and a handful of tracks are bad and kill the song or CD, but if you can let that slide, the production is very good and Snoop does spit some tight West Coast on this. Most of the CD is classic Snoop and shouldn't be looked at negatively. Too many tracks are real good like Snoop World, Gin & Juice II, Show Me Love (produced by DJ Pooh), Whatcha Gon Do?, Still a ""G"" Thang (classic track, one of Snoop's best ever), and See Ya When I Get There. Those tracks are produced very good with nice lyrical content. I can see where the negativity reviews are coming from, but if given a chance, you'll realize that you can't have a West Coast collection without it and it is quality Snoop, you gotta admit it. So please, don't hate on it."
5,No Limit Soldier keepin' it real in Europe,"Forget all ya'll haters. You just mad cause you can't rap like Snoop and No Limit. This cd is tightest, most phattest, unbelievable album I've ever heard. You need to stop doggin Snoop and all the No Limit Soldiers. With this cd, Snoop comes in with his smooth style and mixes it up with that real Dirty South hip hop. This cd is the best there will be for a long time to come. Tracks like Woof, Snoopworld, and Still A G Thang bring out the glory of of Snoop. Be glad Snoop's now a soldier, because without No Limit and Master P, Snoop wouldn't number one on Billboard. For all the soldiers out there, keep bumpin the beats and workin the streets. UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
1,gimmick,snoops really lost momentum and the only good track on here is go awaythe rest is filler and snoops flow gets weak and the beats barely compensatei prefer doggystyle or when snoop recorded with 2pac on all eyez on me but his later cds are just plain commercial and soft
3,its no doggystyle,"while doggystyle is definitely a 5 star cd this comees nowhere near it desptite the attempts to cash in on older songs such as gin and juice and g thang. The best songs are Still a G Thang and Woof although the Woof music video is incredibly stupid and makes no sense. Snoop is not the best rapper ever, that honor goes to 2pac and I hope his next cd isnt an advertisement 4 no limit but a collection of songs with good beats and origanal lyrics. Not a bad cd but not good enough. Peace."
2,This album was a dissapointment,This album was really a disapointment. It really wasn't Snoop. He has gotta ditch the No Limit Beats and go back to his death roe heritage.
2,Master P slowed all the beats and put wackass MC's like...,It was pretty damn bad. Dre is a much better producer and it shows. Master P needs faster beats like Jay Z's and Timbaland's. But it's 2 stars because Snoop's sh*t will always be tight.
2,Pathetic,"This cd showed the lack of inspiration, and time that so many No Limit artist deal with. With such a fast turnover in that company I dont see how any of their artist go Gold. As for Mr. Snoop he should have got more of a variety of producers to lace his album. More collaborations with ex-labelmates Kurupt, Daz,and Dre would have sufficed."
3,NON HIS BEST MATERIAL,I was really dissapointed when I bought this CD. There are only a couple good songs like woof and DPG.
1,GO BACK 2 DEATH ROW,1 word this album is worst than silkk's charge it 2 tha game. go back 2 deathrow
4,My Favorite Snoop Cd,"The beats is cool, but you understand his lyrics! & its not bout all that pimp trash! SNOOP NOT A PIMP...but this is a bangin CD"
4,A Good No Limit Album From Snoop,"This CD wasn't as good as I expected it to be. He could have done a lot more songs with the other No Limit Soldiers. Good songs are,""Snoop World"",""Woof!"",Gin&Juice II,""Tru Tank Doggs"",Still A G Thang"",20 Dollars To My Name"","" and ""DP Gangsta"". Go get this CD!!"
2,"You ain't a frigginn' ""NO Limit Soldier"" Snoop","When I got this CD I thought Snoop would rip it up with some phat Old Skool jams but whan I got down to the listening of the album I found Snoop is almost doing a impersonation of Master P. Now I like MP but I don't want to here some little No-Limit wanna be trying to be just like Da Last Don, come on Snoop you can do better than that. I think what lable a rapper starts with he should stay with, like Sillk, Mya X,and C-Murder all started at No-Limit and are still there. Now Snoop went from Death Row ( which is the best)to No-Limit, and from puttin' out Old Skool to puttin' out this ""New Skool"" crap. So I think Snoop was the best whan he had Doggiestyle and Tha DoggFather, and now he has this No-Limit bullsh*t, so take my advice and crawl back to Dr. Dre and pleed for his forgivness"
2,Trim it down to 4 tracks and you have a decent album,"Snoops latest album is a considerable improvement over his sophomore effort, The Doggfather. However, the album is uninspired and simply not characteristic of the work that Snoop and the No Limit family and capable of producing.My advice: Save some cash and buy Da Last Don."
2,TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am disgusted with Snoops new CD. It totally stinks. Snoop needs Dre, Dre needs Snoop. That is the bottom line. Snoop's best was the Chronic with Dre and Doggystyle. What happen to the DPG gansta's? I was expecting to hear ""Ain't no fun part two"". No limit is cool. But the WestCoast is the sh**. Where's the talent of Rage, Kurupt and Daz?? Snoop please get it together."
4,It's still a 'g' thang.,"Yo,why is everyone saying Snoop get back with Dre, get back with Death Row can I just remind you that Suge Knight is crook and a murderer.Yo,it wouldn't surprise me if he had something to do with Biggie's death.Master P is a much better producer than Suge and for the first time in Snoop's career he actually looks like his gettin' payed.Snoop has matured from those Doggystyle days,stop livin in the past Death Row is over,finished and No Limit is the hottest rap label out there along side Def Jam.After reading this if you still think Snoop go back to Death Row I suggest you read the book 'Have Gun,Will Travel' and find out some of the things that Suge did.Peace out."
1,Quite a dissapointment,"I started listening to this CD with the idea that it was goin' to be old school snoop, so I thought that it was going to be tha bomb. The more I listened to it, the more I was dissapointed. I gave it a try again hoping it would grow on me. That didn't happen. Message to Snoop--you aren't a no limit soldier, get back with Dre. Talk to Cube about his newest release... That was amazing, Cube is amazing."
2,Who took the doggy outa doggy dogg,"Wow, how disapointing. take away everything that made Doggystyle the greatest hip-hop release of th 90's and your left with the empty, souless, whipped up in a week, cash-in piece of toast ""Da game.."". The Doggfather was average but it grew on me ya could tell snoop was tryin some new shizit and still giv'n 100% But this is boring uninovative release that will sadly but surely be the kiss o death for SNoop. I saw snoop live Dec 98 and he only dropped 2 traks of ""Da game.."".- Draw yer own conclusions."
1,"Why Snoop,Why !","I am going to get straight to the point.What is this,Snoop has let us down don't waist your money.First of Master P is a sellout(westside Puff Daddy).And No Limit are a disgrace and they are dragging Snoop down.Think of Snoop now,ridiculous over the top clothes,expensive videos that don't get anywhere and his Eastsidaz are wack.Remember the Snoop on Death Row,dressed like everyone else,cheap videos that made money and Snoop had number one hits unlike now.Death Row where the saviours of westside hip hop and we let them fall apart,and we are the only ones that can bring them back and save G-Funk, Gangsta rap.Dr Dre,come back to Death Row and Snoop, come back to Death Row,dump those Eastsidaz get back with the DPG's and be a superstar again.Doggystyle 2. WESTSIDE."
2,LEAVE THAT WACK MASTER P AND GO TO THE REAL MAN DR DRE,I CANT BELIEVE THIS A MAN WITH SO MUCH TALENT HAVE RELEASE GARBAGE LATELY THE DOGGFATHER AND NOW HIS LATEST ALBUM.. THIS ALBUM IS A JOKE THE PRODUCTION BY MASTER P'S WEAK BEATS BY THE POUND IS A JOKE.. EVEN THE LYRICS ARE STALE JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE NO LIMIT FAMILY .. THEY EVEN TRY TO REHASH 2 OF SNOOPS EARLIER CLASSIC SONGS.. WHICH ARE A JOKE ON THIS ALBUM.. IT HAS THAT IRRIATING MYSTIKAL WHO CANT RAP HIS WAY OUT OF A BROWN PAPER BAG.. SNOOP DO YOUR FANS A FAVOR GET ON THE PHONE AND CALL DRE .. YOU AND DRE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER .. CANT CONTINUE TO RELEASE SUCH GARBAGE AS THIS ..
1,Did I have to pick a star?,"This album is an outrage. although I have not heard most of it, practically mone of it, I will go now after this review and listen to more snippets. I must complain. This is horrible. He devours good songs. Still a G thang, and Gin and Juice 2, are horrible. This is horrible, snoop dogg is horrible..."
1,Desperate,This album is not Snoop Dogg he sounds like he has been in the recording studio smokin something. The songs are nothin like doggystyle or tha doggfather. Gin and Juice 2 and Still a G Thang are bad ideas probably be Master P to sell the album for people who will have a quick look at the back and the fact that it is a Snoop album will always sell copies but if it wasnt Snoop and it was a new comer it would be his last album. DONT BUY THIS YOUR WASTING YOUR MONEY INSTEAD BUY THE WAR DISC FROM ICE CUBE.
4,Not the traditional Snoop Dogg,"This album is a good one. But it isn't the snoop you've heard before. But regardless it is a good album. The only bad thing is that the ""No Limit Soldiers"" (Who I like) especially Master P keeps on interrupting or covering snoops voice. If Master P goes uuunnnnnnhhhhhhhh one more time on this album I'm going to ""unh"" this album to the street. But anyways it is a very good Snoop/No Limit Album. And the good news is after snoop's most recent album ""The Last Meal"" snoop's gonna fly solo and make his own label called ""Dogghouse Records"" which will let Snoop create HIS own music like before."
2,"Wrong guy, wrong beats","This is my first Snoop Dogg album, so I really don't know what he sounded like before No Limit. However, something's just not right on this album. One of the major problem are the beats. You can't really bang your head to it. Also, the lyrics are kind of strange too. Snoop's lyrics almost sounded like Silkk the Shocker. This is a very dissapointing album(again) from No Limit. The track ""20 dollars to my name"" is one of my favorites. It does have a good beat and better than the other songs. Also""Still a G thang"" a snoop solo, can become a classic. 2 good songs for 14 bucks is painful for a rapper as talented as Snoop."
2,don't hang with master p and his gounz,"this album is a total f*** up what a shame he is not even trying,damm....feel sorry for those who wasted their money,hahahaha"
2,"EVERYTHING THAT GLITTERS , ISN'T GOLD","SNOOPS NEW TAPE IS SIMPLY WEAK AS WATER . AS A MATER OF FACT , THE DOGFATHER WAS NOT EXACTLY THE TYPE OF MATERIAL THAT I EXPECTED FROM HIM. WHEN SNOOP FIRST CAME OUT HE WAS KILLING EVERYBODY, DOMINATING THE RAP INDUSTRY; AND NOW THIS, COME ON. THE MAN'S GOT TALENT. HIS STYLE IS UNIQUE AND HIS DELIVERY IS TIGHT( ALTHOUGH NOT AS TIGHT AS IT WAS WITH HIS DEBUTE ALBUM AND STILL HIP-HOP CLASSIC, "" DOGGY-STYLE"".) THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS GO TO THE STUDIO AND GET HUNGRY AGAIN.IDEA: SAMPLE, "" ATOMIC DOG"" FOR THE REMAKE OF, ""WHAT'S MY NAME"""
1,Snoop is better than this.,"Positives: I'm hard pressed to find positive things to say about this record. Snoop is one of the greatest and Doggystyle proved he can make premium rap music.Negatives: This album proved Snoop is also not afraid to fall flat on his face. I don't know where to begin on this album. Any tracks that aren't ""No Limitized"" are just too soft. Snoop has that kind of soft flow but tracks like ""Show Me Love"" & ""Doggz Gonna Get Ya"" are not his patented gangster rap norm. I don't know how I managed to stick with Snoop after this attempt. Every other record Snoop has ever and will make is better than this one."
3,What Else Does One Expect From No Limit?,"I bought this no limit CD because it was Snoop's. The first tracl was amazing and I got excited, as if there could be a new West Coast No lImit hybrid to break rap into the new millenium. Well it didn't hold up. Songs Such as ""Da Game of Life"", ""Slow Down"" and the track which samples the ""Bout it Bout it"" beat kept me from giving it away, I just keep this CD because it helps complete my Snoop Dogg collection. Oh yeah, where's Daz and Kurrupt!"
1,keep this sh*t up and SnOop wont b worTh a pennY!!!!!!!!,"look main, i'm from the dirty south(deep dirty south-New Orleans, Houston, etc.) so u know i b'z down wit NO LIMIT. but on the forealla, this is the most wickkity-wack bullsh*t sNoop doGg haz ever released. if i could take away thaT 1 star i gave this CD i would wit da quickness. this alBum iz so bad it does'nt deserve a tiP of a sTar. the production iz str8 boo-boo. and sNoOp somehow, someway managed 2 fu*k up all his cLasIc hits like ""gin & juice"" ""still a g thaNg"". if i wuz Dr. dRe i would'nt wAnna work wit SnOop's dumb azz no moe. this cd iz str8 GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm glad i didnT buy this cd and if u dId, i guess snOOp ran his so-call ""GAME"" on u."
4,Nice to hear from the DOG!,"I'm so glad snoop finally decided to drop some fat tracks. It sucks that he pretty much ditched the DPG's but hey, when you rock the ice, the haters will come out. I'm glad to hear about this album. LBC baby!"
2,"it's his worst cd ever,calling DPG-DRE","The beat's don't come near the lyric's that snoop putting down. where is the DOG POUND AND DRE THIS NO LIMIT SOLDIERS SHIT NEED TO GO. SNOOP if stay with no limit records which is under the same label as before this sh*t please,please don't get the beats from no limit it is not your style. Your fame and glory is with the WEST COAST BEATS THAT'S THE FLAVOR. CALLING DPG-DRE.The snoop is not gone but the west coast beats has left him."
5,* *! DOPE CD !* *,"SNOOP DOGGY DOGG is at it again, with a wicked album, if you love rap music from the south (DIRTY SOUTH) and you like music from the west (WESTCOAST) then this is the album to get.SNOOP's lucky that MASTER P hooked him up otherwise who knows where SNOOP would be today. Not all the songs are properDOWN-SOUTH tunes, some of them have SNOOP'S own Dogg pound producer; MEECH WELLS. If you think the album has tracks featuring; DR DRE, NATE, WARREN G etc. then your WRONG,The album features; MASTER P, C-MURDER, SILKK, FIEND, MYSTIKAL, MAI X, MAC, SOULJA SLIM and other NO LIMIT SOLDIERS.....The album contains HARD SOUTH STYLE MUSIC. LIKE; woof, hustle and ball, tru tank doggs, 20 dollars and more.....If you wanna ly back and listen to some slow R'N'B TYPE of music then listen to:: show me love, doggs get lonelyTHIS WAS ONE OF SNOOP'S BEST ALBUMS!!LISTEN 2 SOME SAMPLES AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT*!!!!*!*!*!*!*!*! TRU !*!*!*!*!*!*!"
2,Snoop needs to get back with Dre.,"I love Snoop. Just not with No Limit. When he raps over Dre, Daz or DJ Pooh beats he is tight. Beats by the Pound beats are just to unimaginative and repetative. The first three tracks are the only ones I can get into."
1,No Limit Soldier or Death Row Inmate??? No Contest!,"Snoop baby...What are you doing??? A mixture of the Westside & Dirty South doesn't mix. Where's dat' Ni**a Daz or Kurupt??? This album will not make it in my ride for the summer. Dre!!! Hurry up and ""get at him""!!! 'cause your boy's losin' it...(fast)."
2,Go back to Long Beach Snoop,"Snoop has turned from a dominating hotter than the San Fernando Valley on a hot summer day artist to the AVERAGE rapper. He use to have the fresh 213 style we all found tizzite with strong lyrics and even stronger beats from the legendary Dr. Dre. But now he's a no limit soldier with limited lyrical impact with no bite and no bark. The only tight track on the lp is ""Gangsta Gansta"". Of course, it was produced by Dre himself. Go back to Dre and you DPG N-ggaz and find yourself."
2,Give Dre a call,"I am a NO LIMIT fan, but snoops album isnt what I or some others expected it to be. His first album was a huge success,his second o.k, but his latest album is a little less than average.This album shows how he was better off with his old label (Death Row)and producer Dr Dre."
2,"I would give it one star, but I love Snoop, so it gets two.","I must be honest, I love Snoop, I mean Doggystyle was a classic. Also, I disagree with what people say about The Doggfather because it had those playful, bouncy vibes to it. I really loved The Doggfather. But this album? Snoop comes well on it and everything, but the production is not that of Doggystyle, or his very best album, Smokefest 1996, which had DPG guest appearances. Snoop has some good songs, like ""Still A 'G' Thang"", which has a good G-Funk beat, ""Hoes, Money and Clout"", the very best one, that was produced by Daz Dillinger and Soopafly, and ""Payin"", which featured Big Pimpin'. Those tracks all have a DPG feel to them, but the rest is not good at all. ""Gin and Juice II"" is nowhere near as good as the one from Doggystyle. Snoop must get back with Daz and Dre, he's great with them both."
2,Snoop's worst CD by a mile,"---------- was one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history, and Tha Doggfather did not live up to its very high standards. Da Game Is To Be Sold... was a bad mistake. There are about 5 good tracks. My favourite is ""Still A G Thang"". However, No Limit fans may appreciate it."
3,"please, we want dre!","this is better than the doggfather, but ts no doggystyle. rumor is dr dre is producing snoops new album and he has master p's ok to do so. hopefully this is true because snoop misses dre badly! no limit cant match deathrow. without dre snoop is very average , just like this entire cd, but if dre and snoop reunite watchout!"
2,"""CHOKE OFF DA ROPE, DOGGY GOING BROKE.""","CLEARLY A SHINING STAR AMONGST A LEGION OF ONE HIT WONDERS,OL' BOY SNOOP HAS SIGNED HIS OWN DEATH CERTIFICATE.THE SOON PASSING FAD OF THE NO LIMIT SOLDIERS HAS DRAWN SNOOP TO ITS INNER CIRCLE.ONCE A MASTERMIND OF RHYMES THAT WE'D NEVER FORGET,THA DOGG IS DIGGING UP BONES HE SOON WILL REGRET.IF NOT FOR CHARLIE WILSON BEING EVER SO GOOD TO THE GAME,ONE STAR WOULD BE ALL THIS REVIEW WOULD CLAIM!!"
2,Before you buy this here me out.,"Snoop Doggy Dogg is a talented rapper,but, he is no longer in touch with the street. He is one of those rappers that claims he's a ""G"" but where does he live. Not in a hood. He don't know what's goin on in the street. If you wanna hear some real gangsta rap check out YOUNG DRE."
5,Ultima Underworld I and II,"I loved this game as a kid and it is great to get to play this one again. This is the pre-cursor to first person shooters, but the difference is you get a weapon and an shield."
4,The photos are all black & white,"I read this book here in Brazil.This book is easy to read, well organized and have correct informations, about this subject.There's many chapters and every chapter, is about one kind of earthmover.Every chapter has a little historic beggining and then, we can read about the biggests makers of each earthmover machine.Germany to example, produces the biggests hidraulic escavators.The main failure of this book are the photos.All of them are B&W.There; isn't a single color photo, in this book.If a book is a historic book such as about World War I, is good to have only B&W; photos, because only this kind of photo was then available.This book, even about nowadays machines , has only B&W; photos.Then all photos are basically weak.The text is excellent, but the photos are weak.Because of the photos, I'll give 4 stars, not 5 stars for this book."
3,"Broad, readable introduction to Hawaiian creatures","The author has produced a readable book that is wisely focused on a small selection of creatures, rather than trying to cover the totality of Hawaiian wildlife. There are some excellent photographs, and very interesting excerpts from historical documents.On the negative side, the book isn't very detailed--In the introduction he reveals that it is oriented towards teen-aged readers, though this isn't apparent from the covers of the book. There are a couple of minor factual howlers that don't detract from the overall worthiness. There is essentially no coverage of plants, fish, or coral, and surprisingly, the birds covered do not include the more famous endemic Hawaiian birds such as the Nene or any of the Honeycreepers.Despite these limitations, it is interesting and worthwhile, especially if you haven't read other books on Hawaiian natural history."
5,Best Irish Band release 1st UK single,"This is their 4th single but their 1st in the UK. They are a promising young band with excellent songs. Loaded is undeniably great and 25 years too late isnt as good as Loaded but manages too poke fun at new [bands] like Sum 41. Satelites is an epic Guitar track which is unlike any other Rev's song. It is the less punk side to them and shows how versatile their music is. I would highly recommend anyone who likes rock, even pop to do themselves a great favour and check this out."
3,A Good Approach To A Real Laptop,"Laptop design is very good -QWERTY keyboard and an effective mouse- but the games and activities are very limited and will bore to any pre-schooler in a very short term. However, it is a heavy duty electronic toy that must be purchased for training the kid in fine motor skills."
2,educational yes but gets boring,I bought this for my 5 yr old who needed a little extra help in kindergarten. He enjoyed the toy for a first couple weeks but he hasn't touched it since.
3,Only a light reading for saturday,"Like the Luftwaffe Fighter Aces, Mr. Spick does a light job on this book. You can read it in a afternoon and know a little about the luftwaffe bomber aces. They do not have the glamorour of the fighter pilots, but their work is essential.If you are looking for a comprehensive research on this subject go elsewhere. The author sims to use only a few secondary sources.Think twice before buy it."
1,Not so good~!,I have order the black ones for my new 2012 rx 350 and it was perfect but this one whicj was for an older model was TERRIBLE. It was too bulky...Consider getting the new models. it fits way better~!!!
4,A breath of fresh air...,"If you like Minnie Riperton, Nora Jones, or for those who really know their music, Sheri Brown, you'll really love Corinne Bailey Rae. Smooth and easy on your ears and not too bad on your eyes as well.Billy Lyon"
5,Well Worth it,I have been waiting for a soulful singer from England who could live up to the uniqueness of Sade and the musicality of Lewis Taylor. Corinne Bailey Rae definitely fits the bill. A refreshing album during a time when the genre is lacking artistry and originality.
5,Great new artist,"I just love this CD. Corinne's music is a mix of several different genres and comes out having a sound of its own. Her voice is definitely unique, which is a welcomed relief these days. Most of the cuts are very soothing and then there's ""Put your records on"" which is really upbeat and, I think, the best song I've heard this year."
3,CD review Rae,"I thought this was a good CD, not great but good. Ms. Rae's voice is distinctive and the music is enjoyable to listen to."
4,Corinne Bailey Rae - how sweet is she?!!!,"This young lady has such a sweet sounding, easy listening voice - I love it. Her voice is so relaxing and peaceful - totally un-violent. She warms my heart. I will be keeping my ear open for more of her talent..."
3,Corinne Bailey Rae,"I heard her on the radio and loved the song that played.After listening to the cd I found there to be only oneor two good songs, all of the rests sounded the same."
3,Pleasant Music,"There are several songs on this album I love, but there are many songs that sort of sound alike and get a little monotonous."
4,Till it Happens to You,"Corinne Bailey Rae's self-titled cd is perfect to listen to after a tiring day to help you relax or if you are in the mood for a little smooth jazz. The first four tracks of her cd are my favorites and overall I greatly enjoy this first debut by Corinne Bailey Rae, however I must admit that after Track number 5 ""Trouble Sleeping"" I find that all the rest sound pretty much all the same. The beats all seem to run together and there is no distinction between them. But overall, it is a really good cd and I hope to hear more from this talented singer, but I hope that on her next cd maybe she'll spice it up a bit more. So based on this I can only give this cd three stars."
5,Beautiful,"Simply said, this is a cd of ""beautiful"" music from a beautiful artist. Very soothing and enjoyable."
4,Relaxing,I love music that makes you want to turn it and move around. But this CD by Corinne Bailey Rae is not that kind of cd. This cd is for days that you just want to relax and kick back. You will want to sing along with Corinne when you are feeling good. And when you are down you will enjoy just listening to her soulful voice. This is a good cd for anyone that enjoys easy going singing and simple but wonderful songs.
4,She is pretty fresh,I think that this CD is great and relaxing. When you come home and make a cocktail turn her on and you can't help but get in the mood. I prefer her over Norah Jones anyday because she have more soul in her music.
3,Smooth,"A nice album to kick off a girl night's out, or a lazy sunday morning with a cup of joe; it's a Starbucks type of song collection targeted toward the uber liberal hoity toity crowd. I don't agree with the grammy nomination for this actress as I believe there are more far superior than her. I guess when you sing several nicely written songs and have a good pr campaigning for you, everything is possible."
4,Happy Recipient,The recipient of Corinne Bailey Rae was excited about receiving this CD and will enjoy many happy hours of listening.
4,Corrine Bailey Rae,"A great CD for those quiet, mellow moments. Perfect while sharing a bottle of fine wine. A+++"
2,Not so great,"I like two songs, ""Put Your Records On"" and ""Till It Happens to You"" and I kinda like ""I'd Like to"". I really like her voice and I think she has great potential, but I just think alot of the music is empty and cheesy. I don't feel alot of depth in the music or her voice on most tracks. Maybe she just needs to mature a bit."
5,One of THE new voices of 2006!,"It was love at first listen. When I heard Corrine Bailey Rae on The Stix' single ""Young & Foolish"", I knew I'd be seeing and hearing her again.Her debut album doesn't disappoint and is full of light, breezy & summery tunes enhanced by her pure, easy going vocals and sparse, careful production. If you've heard her lead single ""Put Your Records On"" I can tell you it only hints at the magic on the album. I love all the songs but tunes to really watch out for apart from the aforementioned might include: ""Till It Happens to You"", ""Call Me When You Get This"", Choux Pastry Heart"", ""I'd Like To"", ""Butterfly"" and my definite favourite; ""Breathless"". Note also, the gospel-influenced lament ""Seasons Change"" that brings the album to an achingly beautiful close.Great for barbecues, intimate summer evenings or even just chilling with a cold drink on a warm summer's night. Definitely one of the better singers to emerge this year - and she's from my hometown!"
5,Corinne has got it!,"I would not have known about Corinne if it wasnt for my home town jazz station-which told the listeners that she would be on Saturday Night Live. I had to stay up and hear that song again (Put Your Records On)and see what she looked like. I heard this fresh new sound and wanted to put a face with it. I was please to see not only did she have a voice that sounds to me like a cross between jazz and folk, of course a good measure of R&B thrown in, but she could play the guitar!! She is definately the best new artist in my book."
4,"Sweet, Sweet Voice","Ms. Rae has a tiny little voice, that is a pleasure to listen to. Many have compared her to Billie Holiday, and I agree. Soulful, yes. Blues, of course. Oh yes and that ever present R&B.;Though the Grammy Awards snubbed her, hers is a voice that is worth listening to, and in the future only promises more delightful releases. She is and will be a force to be reconded with as she continues to produce more, music with her very unique sound. Give this young lady a very serious listen, I do not believe you will find disappointment."
3,"Too much ""tom foolery"" for this old guy","This young lady has a lot of talent... a LOT of talent. It's easy for me to understand why the kids like her music and why she received 3 Grammy nominations this year. But the sound... well, it's full of thumps and booms and electronic instrumentation and overdubs and mixing and ...well , you get the picture... it's exactly what the kids like, and that's just the kind of recoding I'd expect from any 17 year old singer. If I were between 12 and 20 years old, I'd give it 5 stars. This girl has a bright future and her music should mature nicely as she gets a little older."
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC,"I usually never write reviews for CD's that I have bought but I HAD to take the time to write a review about Corinne Bailey Rae's CD.From the first track to the last and every song in between I have never been more impressed with one singer and one CD then I was with this one. Her beautiful voice lit up every single one of these songs for me. I have had this CD in my car player for the last three weeks and it is the only music I listen to over and over again. I even downloaded her entire CD to my IPOD and computer so that I could listen to it when I am in the house or working out as well... I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who loves soul, blues, jazz, and even country. You will not be disappointed."
5,LOVELY,I really love this CD. Corinee Bailey Rae is a wonderful singer and I can't wait until a new cd comes out. Thanks
4,"Corrine Bailey Rae ""Go on with your bad self !""","It is hard to get me awe struck, but I heard the track 'Like A Star' prior to its U.S. release and had to order this cd from the U.K. And I tell you when I had the opportunity to hear the rest I was highly impressed. Corrine's balance of jazz, R&B, and blues is absolutely marvelous! I just hope that this isn't a lucky freshman cd and she proves to have some longevity. Her music is a refreshing reminder of how R&B used to be absent of all the predictability and vulgarity that you are bombarded with now. I plead to any DJ that reads this review to take it seriously and get this young lady into rotation if you haven't done so already!"
5,"If You have Trouble Sleeping, Put Your Records On and listen to Corrinne Bailey Rae shine Like a Star.","This is a great chill out cd. She has a soothing, sultry and smoky voice. The songwriting is great. If you are looking for some nice relaxing music this cd is the perfect choice. She definitely deserves that grammy nomination."
5,Corrine Bailey Rae,I really like one of the songs that she sings and decided to take a chance and purchase the CD. I am very happy that I did. I love the entire CD. A very pleasant surprise. Highly recommend it for anyone who likes R&B soulful music.
5,Put Your Fingers On This CD ASAP!!!,"Corrine Bailey Rae's debut disc is one of the best albums I've ever heard or listened to and definitely one of the top albums in my collection. With a voice so sweet coupled with hypnotizing backdrops and honest lyrics this album is a work of art, a masterpiece. This is an album that grows on you and is more complete and satisfying then any ""R&B"" album in the last couple years. I enjoy every song and every time I feel like relaxing or thinking or anything of the sort I instantly think of this album. Corrine Bailey Rae created a magical journey with this cd seamlessly going through every human emotion. Love, confusion, doubt, happiness etc. Every song is great to me, no slips. Undeniable grooves, amazing lyrics and a soothing voice makes this a classic for many years to come."
3,I gave this as a gift.,I haven't heard this but my sister-in-law really likes the lady so I got it as a gift for her.
4,Delivered as promised,"The item was delivered on time and in good condition as stated. The cover was somewhat scratched but nothing I couldn't live with. Overall, it was a good purchase at a good price."
4,"Nice, roomy atmospher music. Girly- guys hate it","I like the tunes. Makes ya wanta ""groove"" some songs and write bad poetry others. All males so far within listening distance either try to turn it off, change it out, or ""be back when that crap has ended""..sheesh! Guys! What I don't like is that I like these tunes so much I can't sleep for hearing them replayed in my head.. Over and Over..and over within two days of hearing the tunes."
2,very dissapointing!,"I bought this CD because of track 5 ""Closer"" which I really like thinking there would be others to follow but found that her other songs seem so gloomy and dark.. I tried listening to see if they would grow on me but nothing came.."
2,"a bit of Macy Gray,Norah Jones which =Boring","Corinne Bailey Rae vocally doesn't do much for me. the Off singing style in the vein of Erika Badu or Macy Gray with a pinch of Norah Jones with a smoothed out vibe of India Arie&Alcia Keys doesn't hold my attention fully. some of the material is cool in places,but she ain't worth all the hype she is getting. now She is a Fine Foxxy Mama on the real,but Musically i gotta keep that Singing on Mute. every other year or so there is a Artist like Rae that has the same presentation&vibe.nothing new at all. I just ain't into the off singing."
2,"I've been bamboozled, hoodwinked, and led astray!!!!!","I bought this CD because everyone was raving about how good it was and how Corinne was so talented. I was truly disappointed. She definitely has a different vocal sound but she sounds like she's just learning how to sing. The music sounds good, however, her voice is soooo very annoying. I'd hate to hear her in concert."
2,Corinne Bailey Rae CD,"Didn't really like this CD, not a favorite of mine. Corinne Bailey Rae fans will like it."
4,Corinne Bailey Rae.. soothing to the ear.,This is one music CD that will gently compliment the listeners peaceful mood. No JIVE but continuous and unique tone and melody. Finally a music CD that doesn't offend or disturb. Just soft and gentle and so very sweet.
4,New Breakout Star!,"I happened to stumble upon Corinne Bailey Rae this past weekend and heard ""Put Your Records On,"" on the radio. Right off the bat, I liked the tune - I thought what a cool and breezy song for summer. She was also on Jay Leno last night (June 28) singing her new song, and did an awesome job. I remember watching Norah Jones first appearance on the Tonight Show, and saying, ""This girl is going to be big,"" sure enough Norah's first CD was a Grammy award winning album. I see big things happening for Corrine Bailey Rae too - it's great to hear some new and refreshing talent in today's music scene."
5,WOW!! Great first CD for this new artist!,"I just got this CD and haven't taken it out of my stereo since. What a great voice Corinne has and the music is lively yet gentle. Although it's listed as an R&B; album, I think it's a Pop/Jazz/R&B; fusion. Very original. Highly recommended!And at the current price of under $8.00, you can't go wrong, as the price is sure to increase as she gains in recognition and popularity."
5,Just awesome!,This is a must have! Very well done. This is a very talented chic. Great soul jazzy voice. Writes her own lyrics and plays the guitar. A total package. Buy it today.
3,I hate when Record companies do this,"I hate when record companies re-release albums with bonus songs or dvd. It is just a sneaky way to get more money. Quit trying to make us buy the album twice. Corinne Bailey Rae's music alone deserves 5 stars but to try to get her fans to re-buy the cd is just wrong. If I didn't already own the original, then this would be the way to go. What the record labels should do is save the bonus content for the next album or release it by itself at a lower cost.Onto other business, She did a great cover of Björk'sVenus As A Boyand Led Zepplin's ""Since I've been loving you""."
4,Loved the 1st CD!,"I really like the first CD in this set. I play it often. But, I've only played the second one a couple of times. Just doesn't have the same appeal as the first one. She is a great artist, though! I like her unique style."
5,Simply Beautiful.,"Easy listening.Delicate, soothing, soulful voice.Beautiful lyrics and melodies.Corinne Bailey Rae is talented.She is going to be around for a very long time."
1,Won't play on a PC or iPod,My wife purchased this CD expecting to use it on her PC to put it on her iPod and we were dismayed to discover that the copy protection prevented us from using the disk. There was nothing on the packaging to indicate the presence of DRM mechanisms that would prevent this standard and reasonable use of the product.
2,Easy to listen to,"This mellifluous (but glib) collection is completely narcissistic. It creates a mood ideal for indulging one's narcissism. Needless to say, we all need to do this from time to time. If you want music to help you feel, here's one that works. If you can feel something on your own, get something else. This one won't make you uncomfortable by urging you to think."
3,A Rea of Sunshine,"Yup, I punned her name, but I really do like this album. Lets cut to the chase. It is a good album, and worth spending the money on.Why did I only give it three stars? Well, Corinne has a bit of a girlie voice for my liking. It is beautiful, but lacks a mature quality that I may have trouble growing with down the road. There is a nice mix of music, and unlike some of the other guitar strumming chicks out there, there is at least one danceable tune (thank G*-).If you like the Lilith Fair crowd of artist then Corinne Bailey Rea is a great fit. Honestly, I hope that I'm not seeing another Tracy Chapman. Tracy's first album was good, but what has she done for me lately (I love days like this).Kevin"
4,Nice and Smooth,"Listening to Corinne is like sipping on a warm cup of chamomile tea. This songbird has a voice and demeanor that is out of this world. Her words are like poems (words to the songs are included with the cd). I love her two most popular songs right now. ""Put your Records on"" is a song for the girl that feels like she doesn't fit in anywhere. She's telling her to just be herself and don't care what others say. Her other song, and my favorite, is ""Like a Star"". This is the most beautiful love song that I've ever heard. Buy this cd. This is the best cd for those days when you've had a hard day at work and just want to come home, drink a glass of wine, and relax. Great cd!"
5,Beautiful angelic voice!,"I heard her at a concert in New York that was shown on Direct TV and knew that I had to get the CD. I love her voice and the way that her band and back-up singers allow her voice to shine through and not cover it up or drown it out. I have told everyone about her and how they should also get her CD for themselves.Her voice is so clear and crisp and beautiful, I just love listening to every nuance of the notes that she hits.Her mellow, soulful, bluesey, slightly jazzy style is something new and different that has been a long time coming but well worth the wait. She will be going places, everywhere!"
4,Mostly great soulful stuff but with a few so-so items,"Corinne shows great promise as a composer & vocalist. Most of the tracks are excellent, displaying lyricism with sweet, catchy melodies. Nice interplay, a pleasant album which flows nicely. Pity that a couple or more fillers removed one star off top grade."
5,Corinne Bailey Rae,"This is the second time I have purchased this CD by Corinne Bailey Rae. The entire CD is filled with beautiful songs. Many times you purchase a music CD, only to find a couple songs you like. This CD has an entire collection of songs you want to listen to. I loved my first purchase and it's even better the second time."
5,Brilliant,"I love this CD. Her sultry, soulful voice, lush arrangements and poetic lyrics take me away. I can relax to it, dance to it, listen to it on repeat."
3,Awesome music,This is one of the best CD's I've listened to in along time. She is so easy to listen too and I play it constantly.
3,Its OK,The CD is just alright. I only like a couple of the songs. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
1,This is NOT The Offspring music,This is a CD filled with interviews and info about the band (told by some woman). It really doesn't contain real music. The other guy who reviewed this probably didn't even hear the CD. This CD is pretty useless. All the info that's on it can be found on the internet.
3,Okay for a beginner,"This book is not a bad place to start for basic radiologic anatomy, but it has far too little detail in the neuroanatomy area for a radiology resident. It is a good choice for medical students or non-radiologists."
3,It is ok...,I have not been able to really use the pack n play yet as my baby wont be here for another 3 months but I am disappointed in the mobile. It does not move unless you move it. The battery pack that plays music is very hard to hear so I dont think I will use that at all. Also I wish it was a little bit more narrow so it could fit through door frames.
1,What's in this set?,"No one has reviewed this set because no one knows what the heck is in it!! Please tell us what the movies are, Amazon!"
3,Loud,"The motor works, but its very loud. You might not hear it in a night club but if you use it in your home, you will hear it."
4,Good Cd,"One of my favorite songs is on this one is it good to you and the other songs like dont curse and now that we've found love is good songs too, simply one of the best lyricist of all time in my opinion I give lyrics 10/10 Beats 8/10"
4,The joy of music,"I owned this C.D. in the past and gave it away as a gift, then regretted my actions afterward. Although it may not be, I feel this C.D. was one of Heavy D's best."
3,Christian the Lion mini movie poster,This is a copy of the movie poster in a 11 X 17 inches size. The poster is a good artist's rendering and includes all the main characters. The large drawing of Christian's face is very cute.The quality of the copy is fair to poor. It looks like the original was folded and you can see the fold marks separating the poster into 6 squares.
1,Not Happy,The entire inside was missing. I just got the outer shell unfortunately it cannot be used as is.Not happy.
1,I Returned this worthless rag,"I have read numerous wealth-building books. This one is worthless. It appears to be a hastily written collection of his personal stories which may or may not be applicable to you. He in several instances tells you how to bend the rules precariously, such as moving to other states to avoid bankruptcy and also tells you how to perform deceptive marketing. I have never, honestly never, felt so scammed by a book purchase, and wish I could give negative stars to warn the reader away. [SPAM ALERT I now get 10 to 20 spams a DAY sent to a unique email I used requesting my refund!]"
1,TOTAL FRAUD,"I happen to know this author from his early escapades, and he was well known among his friends and acquaintances as a greasy con man -- hence his bankruptcy early on. For kicks, I got his book and confirmed that it is as worthless as the man himself. He's a total fraud, and if you want to do worse than waste your money you'll buy his book instead of applying yourself with truly worthwhile business ventures. Buyers beware -- avoid at all costs!!!Robert Long"
2,LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL,"This book is an intro to writing business plans filled with examples, but not saying very much.It's like being able to read the script of an early morning infomercial in your hand and every bit as worthwhile. Some of the stories can be construed entertaining or inspiring, but relying upon Bruce Berman to get you started would be unwise."
1,When Will People Stop Falling For This Stuff?,"This has got to be one of the worst business/wealth building books I have ever read. Out of boredom, I got this for free off the internet while surfing the web LATE one night. I would never have paid for a book like this. I just want a chance to warn others before they think about purchasing this rag. If you get it for free it does make for nice bonfire kindling if folded properly. Other than that, I cannot think of any good use for this book. Infomercial in a can...and that's where this book belongs."
3,A good read but a bit implausible,"This isn't a book in which Sherlock Holmes appears, rather it is set in the 1970's and the main character is a TV actor that plays Holmes.Although I quite enjoyed this book there is one glaring oversight that the author makes (I will mention it here because it won't give away who the guilty party is) - at the end of the book the crook is killed and ""Holmes"" is knocked unconscious. Only these two people knew who the crook was, yet when ""Holmes"" comes to he is hailed as a hero and everybody now knows the full story. Who told them?"
1,leak with dr browns bottles,Standard nipple claimed to fit most bottles...bought them for the price but it was a waste for me. Had to throw away.
3,"Not really ""fast"" flow","Well, I had been using the Evenflo fast flow (with the bigger hole not with the X) which were adequate for 3-4 yrs old and beyond but needed fresh replacements and tried the ""Gerber First Essential 6 Pack Silicone Nipples, Fast Flow"". The Gerber's fast flow holes are smaller than the Evenflo fast flow and are only equivalent to the Evenflo medium flow nipples. So the Gerber option did not work for me. I will then try the Evenflo fast flow with an X (instead of a hole) version."
4,Perfect flow!,"Unfortunatly, the nipple base is a little too small for some of my standard size bottle tops and causes some leaks at the base. Other than that, it is a perfect flow for a brand spanking new baby. My baby seems comfy with these nipples and the shape."
5,Great value!,"I have been using it exclusively for the first 4 months of our baby's life. Size, flow and color are good. The baby likes it. Easy to clean . What else can I say about a nipple? Highly recommended in case you don't want to splurge money on those high end nipples."
4,Good quality.,Good quality nipples. Silicone is not thin as the others we have tried. Price I paid is about right. My kids are not complaining.Made in USA.
1,Leaks on Evenflo glass bottles with Evenflo collars,"Not sure if it's the nipples' fault or the Evenflo collars. But, they leak. The glass bottles were given to us. We thought we we saving $ by buying just the nipples & collars. Should've invested in complete sets - bottle, collar & nipple in one package."
1,Leaks,I was disappointed to find that these nipples leak. I tried on 2 different bottles with the same result.
1,"Wordy, confusing, terrible",The author has the knack for taking a simple topic and hiding it in a wordy description. It's too bad there is not a negative star rating.
1,This is an unauthorized release,"No Hitchcock films are in the public domain. Please do not support piracy. This film is available on Criterion DVD and blu-ray, please support studios that care about the films they release."
1,PIECE OF JUNK !!!!!!!,"With less than 6 Months of service this unit stopped working, and just in time for the holidays!!Very dissapointed with amazon for selling such a poor quality product."
2,"Great looks, good functionality, poor reliability","The microwave unit looks great in our kitchen. I love the design and the spacious oven room. It's easy to use, and have more advanced options you can program if you want. The 1250w comes handy for quick cooking. However, as noted in several other reviews the reliability leaves something to be desired. Mine broke down after two years. Most likely the fuse is blown because it's completely dead (common problem apparently after some research on the web). I have reverted to a 10-year old microwave while I try to find a place to have it repaired for less than what a replacement will cost."
4,Great product,"I bought this product for my daughter as a house warming gift; she specifically wanted a stainless steel look. She loves the way it looks but more importantly how it works. This machine is quiet, heats evenly and is powerful without being monsterous in size. I would definately recommend this microwave."
2,broke in 2 days,"I bought this microwave home two days ago and was thrilled at first. Until I got up this morning and heard a horrible buzzing noise coming from the kitchen, it was the microwave. I am taking it back today for a refund and choosing a different model."
1,TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK,"I read a lot of negative reviews about this phone before I purchased it...hoping mine would turn out differently...But I'm sorry to say this phone is a total piece of junk! I've had it for less than two months and it is already living up to its bad reputation...It powers off all the time, even in the middle of calls...and if you do manage to hold a conversation, it constantly buzzes and clicks when you are on the phone.Just junk...My samsung lasted for 4 years with zero problems even after being dropped over and over...4 years, this one didn't even make it two months!!! No wonder they're practically trying to give them away!"
3,It's a RAZR and it's Magenta.,"Moto's RAZR has always been form over function. They keep up with the tradition, even years after the first RAZR was produced and with no concern for improving it. Speaker phone quality is fairly crappy, but then again, the thing is too thin to fit a real speaker into so who are they kidding?Haven't used the myFaves feature because we have unlimited m2m and have trouble using up over 100 minutes a month on the shared plan."
2,What they don't tell you,"I got this phone, not through Amazon, for almost nothing. For that price it's a decent phone. Poor video, always dark. Nothing exceptional about the phone, its best quality is its small size. DO NOT BUY THE INSURANCE! I normally avoid insurance everywhere, but it seemed like a good deal with T-Mobile. The T-Mobile rep I talked to failed to mention the $70 deductable and you don't sign any documents to add the insurance so you only have the rep's word to go on. You can buy a quality used mobile phone and move your number for less than $70."
5,You Remind Me [Maxi-Single],"All four mixes of the ""You Remind Me"" single are very good in my opinion. These mixes sound like Mary actually went back into the studio to re-record her vocals, not just slap a different beat over the same arrangement, which sometimes sounds off! My favorite of the four mixes would have to the Jazz Mix, the new arrangement of vocals flow smoothly with the jazz beat. If you can find it for a good price, I'd say buy it!----------------------------------------------------------------------------Track Listing:1) You Remind Me (Daddy Hip Hop Mix)2) You Remind Me (Bentley's Mix)3) You Remind Me (AD's Radio Mix)4) You Remind Me (Jazz Mix)"
3,THE HOLLOWBODIES ARE REFRESHING!,I saw The Hollowbodies in Virginia Beach and loved them! They have sweet melodies and intelligent lyrics. Compared to the crap I hear on the radio they are amazing...but because they are well above average you will probably never get to hear them on the radio! I totally disagree with Tom Lanbaum! Tom are you a failed musician?
2,Good Fun-but no replaceable batteries!,"These are really cute and I have bought them locally for the last two years, but I thought these would be better because it says the batteries are replaceable--but they are not- Unless you want to slice open your duck with no way to put it back together!"
1,vital remmains deshristianize,This is not the Vital Remains that kicked ass.EXCRUCIATING PAIN & LET US PRAY are the onlyVital Remains that really KILL.
4,Better than Deicide,"Well metal fans...this cd takes the cake. The drums are fast...the guitars are melodic...and the vocals demonic. The only reason I didn't give this cd 5 stars is because the songs at times seem to run together. Who is this ""Fred Dursts' number one fan""? Anyone else notice that every band he reviews with regards to extreme metal is rated the same? And he mentions the same bands over and over...makes me wonder if it is a bot...oh well buy this cd and you won't be disappointed."
5,This is a very very very very very very very good album...,"Death metal is a genre thats commonly repeditive and boring, well this band does not fit that discription at all. , Some of the best death drumming ive ever heard, the guitar work is the absolute BEST ive ever heard on a death metal record. And the vocals, Ive never been a big Glen Benton fan from his work with deicide, i dont know what happend but the vocals on this cd are incredibly powerful and hauting. BRILLIANT ALBUM \m/ most cirtainly the best of 03'."
5,The Best Ever Black Death Metal!!!,"No words can give these credit band, try to get the CD then U will know the difference between these band with other BlackDeath bands!!!truly LIGHTNING STRIKE type guitarist from the Japanese!!will DEICIDE new album be sounds like these too???"
5,Impressed.,"Well, one of my friends told me about this band called vital remains but i actullie haven't heard about them before...So, i decided to give them a chance & i was very happy with that choise because the whole album is brilliant with great lirycs as well as topnotch production. I mean, just look at the title? i highly recommend vital remains's "" dechristianize"" if your into satanic deathmetal that doesn't dissapoint."
4,Satanic and dark,"Vital remains is a band that recently discovered. I checked out a few of their songs, and then bought this album, and i am glad that i did. The singer is the singer from Deicid, a band that is no where near as good as vital remains. This is the only album i have heard form VR, but it is enough to keep me held over for awhile. Check it out."
4,The Miyu series gets another part to it...,"Yui is related to Miyu by blood in several ways. She is a young vampire that does not know of her heritage and is trying to deal with the bizarre cravings and the strange dizzy spells that attack her every so often. But once she learns of her vampiric self, there is no going back...The drawings are beautiful, as with all of Narumi Kakinouchi's work. The story is good, but I prefer Miyu and Juline."
4,Cool containers!,"I bought these for the unique UFO container that space mucus come in. I gave the mucus to a kid to play with and I kept the containers and made geocaching hides out of them after painting them silver and adding a magnet and log. Everyone loves the unique hide. If I was to review the mucus, it was interesting and cool, glowed and was slimy as you might expect."
4,Chairs for our boat came the wrong color,I'll start by saying that the chairs are what we where looking for.we were very carefull to order the gray color chairs. But they arrived blue instead. We desided to keep them anyway to avoid that problem of shipping them back. The blue is still a good color for use on the dock at the club. Quality seems very good. Looking forward to spring and trying them out for real.
2,"Looks nice, best think twice!","I bought two and am returning them today. I could barely connect the back of the chair to the rest of the mechanism without breaking a sweat or busting a vein in my head. Also, there is no way of carrying these things around without hurting yourself or anything within a 3 foot radius of your person (just ask the poor guy who was trying to help me....Sha-Bam, Batman!). Can't wait to see how much it costs to return them. Ouch.Anyway, if you can get the chair together once and not have to move it anywhere, ENJOY! It's wide seat and sturdiness should work out just fine for you. Too bad 'mountaineering camp' is something you actually have to do, it does not show up with the click of ones heels. Bummer."
4,great car camping chair,"This chair was everything I hoped it would be: sturdy, comfortable (no bar cutting across the front of your legs like those quad fold chairs), lightweight and easy to set up. The back of the chair folds down into the seat making it a little less bulky to carry/store. From the picture, I imagined the back to feel more solid but it feels a little like a sling-back chair so you don't sit as upright as the picture might indicate."
4,"Great Chair, but a downside","The new chair is great! It is very comfortable, folds down easily and looks really good. Excellent for people who are ""not small."" But...for travelling, it is hard to fold up. One way I tried to fold it resulted in closing my arms between the chair arms and seat mechanism (not recommended). The next method took 2 people. The chair would be highly recommended if it was easier to close while maintaining the stable feel while seated."
