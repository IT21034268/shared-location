3,"Great movie, very poor quality","I love this movie, but the transfer is very poor. At times it looks downright horrible on large HDTV sets that are common today. For the price, Warner Brothers should create a better master or even better, release this on blu-ray."
3,Will not play on DVD recorder/player.,"I loved this movie at the movies and have been waiting for it to come out on DVD. BUT!!!! It won't play on my Sony DVD player/recorder, but did on my portable player. I checked the container, which said: This disc is expected to play back in DVD video 'Play Only' devices and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives. I've never seen this before and feel ripped off!!!I'm sending a comment to Warner Brothers, too."
1,A grudge review,"Jeez, they'll let anything onto VHS... One of the reviews below says that if I don't think this movie's funny then ""YOUR (sic) A CORPSE"". Well, somebody better call 911 on me, then. This is a grudge review, given to one of those (thankfully) rare movies that actually made me angry that I'd lost 90 minutes of my life watching it. I sat there like a stone from start to finish. If I could give it negative stars I would - as it is, if my rating helps bring its star average down it'll provide some small measure of comfort..."
5,The purchase process was perfect from beginning to end.,"The product was very well priced, delivered quickly, and arrived exactly as described. The movie is an oldie but a goodie. I was excited to see that it was released on DVD."
4,Underappreciated Gem,"""Under the Rainbow"" was literally trashed by the critics and virtually ignored by the masses on initial release in 1981. Time being the great equalizer my verdict in 2010 is not too shabby. I think the sin of ""Under the Rainbow"" is that it tackled an aspect of a timelessly classic film that has a strong sense of nostalgia for a lot of people. This film will not get you misty for ""The Wizard of Oz"" but it works on it's own terms. It's loopy, it's chaotic, it's fun. It's a terrific way to while away 100 minutes. Director Steve Rash helmed the masterful ""The Buddy Holly Story"" and doesn't scale those heights here but it shouldn't be held against this flick."
3,Good slapstick comedy but wrong date!,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1981. Why is it advertised on amazon as being released in 1971, when it came out in 1981?Great performances by Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher. Not the most enduring of comedies, but worth watching."
1,I love the movie too but...,"...either the master itself or the manufacturing process for this particular archive product is defective. There is a problem with poor compression and edge ringing that absolutely ruins this DVD-R release. Don't believe the small sample flash video of the film over at the Archive site. It hides the problem of what seems to be an ""old, smeary analog master"", to quote one Home Theater Forum participant that confirmed that this is a mass problem with this disc, not just my personal bad luck. I actually remember this one when it was running in theaters and it deserves better treatment than this. It's a strange little tale of a hotel across the street from MGM in 1939 that is trying to cash in on the publicity of the making of The Wizard of Oz and all of the strange goings on that surround it. Some of it is completely inane, but it is largely a fun film. Until Warner's fixes the problems with this one, avoid at all costs."
1,Light of Broadway,This product was never received but I had to click on a store in order to proceed.
1,"PhD student from Navarre, FL",This book is poorly organized and poorly written. I do not recommend this book as a good text book for organizational theory and practices.
3,smells good..taste is weak,"I must be desensitized to hazelnut. But then, the Toriani syrups still work???Been searching the world over for hazelnut flavoring for my coffee. Used the Torian syrups for years but just too much sweeter so have been looking for a low-cal, straight flavor. This is the third or fourth type of this item i have purchased and tried. All have the same issue...smells great...no taste. Can't figure that out??? Would blame my self except for the fact that i can taste the hazelnut in the toriani???For this one, one drop as suggested barely even makes the coffee smell hazel-nutty. Four drops and you can tell this is a mostly chemical product. So, will put a couple of drops in my coffee till it's gone and smell the hazelnut..."
3,Flavors Natual or Chemicals?,"The taste, should not be compared to the flavored coffee creamers you buy in the grocery store. Use less than what is recommended or the flavor will overwhelm your taste buds. The item smells natural but taste like chemicals."
5,Don't be a jerk; Do us all a favor and read this book,"Well Well. The greatest book for those that can't find good feedback; and those hopelessly lost in self-help mantras and the like. Before you give me a story, realize that I see it as such. I hate stories! I can't care! Understand that you are trying to get a free ride; avoid paying your share (our national pastime?) and blaming others. You Lose! Read this book and see the ugly truth!"
1,Disappointed!!!!!,"This book failed to live up to what I expected and contained a ton of errors. I thought Dr. Ken Cimino's Politics of Crystal Meth a much better read. It contains real live experiences of addiction and recovery. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't recommend that book, but it should."
2,He Could Have Done So Much Better,"This book has no bibliography - first indication that it isn't meant to be taken *that* seriously. The thing that surprises me is that the author clearly did do some homework. Why, then, didn't he cite his sources? I have many of the studies to which he referred, so I know that the information he provided is peer-reviewed and accurate, but he presents it in such a way to negate it's importance.There are some typographical errors as well.If he had taken the time to work with an editor and to cite his sources the book would be not only an interesting read, but full of valuable information.I got the impression that he was more interested in getting a book published than in providing useful, accurate information. It's too bad, because it could have been so much more useful."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This was the last book I read before my most recent relapse. I cannot be sure that I decided to reinvestigate drugs because of the trigger potential in the interviews, or simply to block out the poor writing quality, lack of epidemiological inquiry, or the fact that it comes off as patronizing and uninformed.Try ""Meth: America's Home-Cooked Menace,"" instead."
3,"A little rough, but cute enough!","These sheets are cute as can be. The sheet set is not the traditional deal where the sheets and pillow case match; the pillow case continues on the theme of the sheets, but has a little buzzing bee and one or two big flowers only. They are not the softest - don't know what the thread count is, but my son's sheets from Pottery Barn were MUCH softer and felt more like cotton sheeting. But the price (only $30) and unique flower power theme makes up for the less than super-soft feel.Addtl comment after washing: we purchased the twin size, and these are tightly fitting. If you have a deep-pocketed mattress, or are trying to get these on a bunkbed, especially a bunkbed up against a wall as is the situation in our case, you might not want to purchase these as the fitted sheet can be difficult to pull on over each corner of the bed."
5,"Michael Johnson ""That's That""","Excellent CD. Michael Johnson is an amazing writer and musician. We used ""I Will Whisper Your Name"" for our wedding song in 1989 and it sounds as good and fresh as it did back then. That can't be said for much of the popular country music being produced today."
1,Never got it,I ordered this and was sent a totally different CD I could see if I had a huge order but it was 1 CD and they screwed that up. So I am sure my father would have enjoyed the CD if he could have received the right one.
4,Not as advertised,"I purchased this mainly to be used as a monitor, and to be used once in a while as a TV when traveling in the RV. It advertised as having PIP, but it does not have this capability. No support on this issue from the manufacture. I am pleased with the overall performance of the monitor/tv."
1,No Picture-in-Picture,I'd be curious to know how the other reviewer got picture-in-picture to work on the 710MP. I am told there is no such feature.
3,Good price - poor picture,"So far I am very dissatified with the picture quality on this unit. I have adjusted the brightness all the way up to 100%, but the picture is still very dark. Adjusting contrast does not help. I have not had an opportunity to contact Customer Support on this issue yet. So I still have hope that it can be resolved."
4,"Excellent Monitor, Average TV","I find this monitor excellent. Its very sharp and works great.As a TV, when I sit at my computer its pretty bleh quality, but if I sit a few feet away (like laying on my bed) it looks fine. I don't need a high definition TV on my desk, I can go into the next room for that."
1,Defective after 2 weeks,"I bought this monitor through Amazon. It worked fine for two weeks, but then it started having serious trouble. All dark, solid colors (especially black) appeared bright green no matter what color settings were applied. Because the online retailer's (JR Electronics) return policy was up, I'm still dealing with Samsung trying to get it replaced. In the meantime I bought a Sharp to replace it, and I would recommend a Sharp model to anyone shopping for an LCD monitor/TV."
4,Got what I paid for,"I know that this book is rare and the price for a new copy would be $100+So we ordered this used (older edition) book. It was in a good shape, just as described, but the quality of binding is really low. As soon as I opened the book it (the binding) cracked in two. :-) But I am satisfied with the purchase."
1,Not eggnog flavor.,"The smell is right, but the taste is way off--at least, it's off if used to try to flavor milk. Maybe it would be better in something else."
5,Keeps spinning and spinning in my cd player!!,"The original album version is just breathtaking, with sexy lyrics and sang by the sexy unique touching voice of Darren Hayes. The other five remixes are very unique on its on, I especially like the remixes done by Specificus, when listening to the Insomniac Mix it feels like it has taken you to a twilight zone, and the Specificus Let It Go Mix, those percussion and drum beats, with Darren's voice at the background just sets you heart pounding!! I personally don't like remixes, but this remix single is just an exceptional one!!"
4,A weaver's pattern book,Was glad to find this out of print book in this good of condition. Book was all that it was advertised to be and arrived in promised time frame. Would buy from this vendor again.
5,A Book for All Weavers,"Even though this book has been around since 1944, it is still a must have for all handweavers. There are black and white pictures and drafts for hundreds of four shaft patterns."
5,"Great book, not out of print (1/5/07)","As of this date (1/5/07), this book is NOT out of print; it's available from various sellers at about $36, so no need to pay OOP prices for it.That being said -- it's a great book. Lots of pattern drafts, an essential in any weaver's library."
1,Broke day one!!!,Broke day 1 out of the box leg snapped off Gonzo as soon as I took him out of the box...
3,"Compilation of Season 1 episodes, hardly anything more","The good news:- The Flintstones are out on DVD!- There's 28 episodes!- The ""Flagstones"" pilot is on here as a special feature!- Each episode has the original intro and extro of the inaugural 1960 seasonThe bad news:- Hardly any special features (some are even missing the sound).- No commentary, by anyone (Harvey Korman would have been great).- Episodes haven't been remastered, with subtle signs of dirt and dust particles throughout from the master prints.- A non-rigid outer plastic sleeve, which makes putting back the DVD set in the sleeve an adventure."
5,Best cartoon ever!,I have loved the flintstones all my life! I was born in 1963 and I still watch the flintstones 5:30 every morning.
5,Yabba Dabba Dooozy!,"It's about time! One of the world's best cartoons!!! They did a good job remastering the prints. I would like to have the studio audience removed, but hey, you can't have your gravelberry pie and eat it too! I would also would have loved to see the cigarette commercials from the 60's too!"
5,Only thing lacking is the extras,"The picture on this DVD set is OUTSTANDING. Even on my widescreen HDTV set, the picture is crisp and clear, and shows absolutely no artifacts one would expect from a 40 year old show. My only real complaint would be with the extras. Where are the beer and cigarette commercials which were part of the original program???????? And why do the ""Pebbles"" commercials have no sound....let alone, why are they even included? ""Pebbles"" didn't come to fruition until the later years of the program."
5,Don't Make Them Like They Used To,"Classic, entertaining, and fun to watch. From childhood to adulthood, The Flintstones cartoon is worthy of a 5 star rating. Everything from the classic Flintstones theme song, to each hilarious episode, delivers cartoon entertainment by the minute. Love it!"
4,"Great Show, but . . .","I love the Flintstones and was excited to see it come out on DVD. But I was disappointed that there are no chapters within each program, making it hard to find a scene you want. Also, on the extra disc, the Fruity Pebbles commercials don't have any sound. Does anyone else have this problem or is my set defective? All in all, great packaging and the picture quality is better than I have ever seen on TV. Yabadabadoo!!"
3,Something missing,"I agree most of the (positive) sentiments expressed, but I have to ask this question.Where is the original opening/end theme with the theme song? This is an integral part of the show and for a DVD to claim to be THE ORIGINAL TV show and to omit this is a huge (and deliberate)oversight. What's the problem? Copyright? I have another Classic TV DVD and no original theme also. I wont be buying Season 2 if this is the case. Everything else though, including the packaging is first class."
3,Jackie Gleason in animated form-- Fred Flintstone,"THE DVD SET HAS 28 EPISODES --- BUT NOT ANY OF THE THEME SONGFROM THE ORIGINAL SERIES(COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS, I THINK)--- ANDTHE SPECIAL FEATURES SIDE OF DISC 4 IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITHALL DVD PLAYERS. PICTURE QUALITY OF EPISODES IS GOOD."
3,Not my kind of Flintstones,The seller did excellent and delivered exactly what was promised. I on the other hand should have done more research on what I was ordering. I received the first season of the Flintstones which I ASSUMED was from when I was little (80's). It was not. The first season was released in 1960. It was not geared towards children AT ALL and is more of an adult show. I guess they started gearing more towards kids in the 80's.
3,WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS??!!!,"Am I the only one who remembers and owns the FLINTSTONES Laserdisc box set from 1995, produced by Ren and Stimpy creator John Krisfalusi including the first 13 episodes with the option of NO LAUGH TRACK??!! For what reason would they not include this on THIS box? ALSO missing from this DVD box set are all the toys they listed, PLUS the Cigarette commercials of Fred and Wilma smoking, THEY'RE EXTREMELY FUNNY! Politically correct stinks to high heaven."
4,Yabba dabba doo!,"If you want to introduce the kids to something different and interesting, try this dvd box set. Better dialog than today's mindless toons."
5,FLINTSTONE DVD,This was exactly what I have been looking for. I was really pleased with my purchase my kids enjoyed watching the Flintstones cartoons compared with the cartoons they have out now this will always be a classic. Thanks Amazon!!!!!!
3,Quality,"What I have watched has been great. At first I thought it was wavy, but I watched something else and it look ed the same. So good quality."
3,Where's the Yabba?,"I have fond memories watching the Flinstones as a kid and thought it would be great to have my kids exposed to such. Barney & Fred seem to fight more than I remembered- do I want my kids watching that? They always make good in the end though. The biggest disappointment was the theme ""From the Town of Bedrock..."" is not sung in the first season- That's half the fun, the sing along!Thus, go for the second season."
3,A little disappointed at first,"I grew up watching the Flintstones, so when I wanted to get some episodes to show to my children I bought season one. The biggest suprise from season one is that I was not greeted with the familiar Flintstones theme song (I assume this comes in a later season). The animation seems a little ""rough"" on some of the early episodes too. But the more we watch and the further we get into the discs, the more it improves. My suggestion for anyone purchasing the Flintstones is to throughly read the reviews and descriptions to find out what that particular season contains."
2,Received dvds but received the WRONG season...,"Received dvds very fast but unfortunately, I received the 5th season not the 1st season that I wanted. So for that reason I'm giving this 2 stars because it's not what I ordered!"
1,I hope it works now!,"Bought this in Oct., 2004 and it arrived within 2 weeks. That is the good news. The bad news is I plugged it in and it did not work. Contacted Haier and Customer Service was helpful in giving me names & phone numbers of repair services in my area to contact for ""warranty"" service. Unfortunately, first company I called no longer serviced Haier products. They told me it was not profitable for them. Second company took 3 weeks to get parts (needed a new compressor & tubing was kinked) and 2.5 hours for repairs to be finished. Pretty sad for a NEW wine cooler. Hopefully it will work now. I'd recommend that if you purchase this unit don't buy it on line. Go to a retail store where you can return it if it doesn't work. Much easier! Positive point is the unit is attractive and compact."
1,It vibrates,"Don't buy this unit. After running a Haier wine cellar for ~4 years, I lost my entire wine collection. Why? Vibrations. After pulling bottle after bottle of wine and finding that they had gone off, I began investigating why. At first I thought it was temperature fluctuations, or the fact that the tinted glass may not be UV resistant. However, the final answer came when I tested for vibrations. And there are *a lot* of vibrations in the interior. I lost 60+ bottles of premium wine; don't make the same mistake."
2,Beware - it may not be what you expect.,"We so looked forward to our ""60-Bottle Wine Cellar, with Slide-Out Racks"". Unfortunately, it was delivered damaged but Amazon.com was great about sending out a new one quickly, etc. No problem with Amazon.com. The problem is that the racks do not ""slide-out"" as Haier claims. If you lift the back of the rack out of a groove the rack can be lifted out - careful if you have 5 wine bottles on there! No ""easy access"" as it says in the product description. Haier should be honest and call them ""adjustable racks"" like in a regular refrigerator. We called Haier and they said their ""gliding"" racks come out on a track. But who knew to look for ""gliding"" instead of ""sliding""? So if you don't need racks that slide out on a track so you can see the bottles towards the back of each rack, then you'll probably be happy with this unit. We aren't."
1,Poor Service,"This unit may work fine but it arrived in non-working condition. It had no power when plugged in. Haier was called and service person came out but could not get response from Haier. No call backs, no nothing. Haier parts and repair service is not satifactory. Unit is still unrepaired and will be returned after a month of trying to get part and response."
1,Doesn't Work Out of the Box,"I took it out of the box, plugged it in and 10 minutes later it made a really loud continuous high pitch sound. Called Haier; finally got a guy to come out and he said we needed a new compressor! I wish I would have got it at Bestbuy so I could have returned it. I wouldn't recommend buying this on Amazon."
2,Uninspiring for general use. OK for researching PLEX.,"The book has a good premise, and the cover art is interesting. Unfortunately, the contents between the covers fail to live up to the promise.If you can avoid choking on the force-fed propaganda that the PLEX company is, and always has been, the only company in the world that makes transforming robots, you'll be tripped up by the boring designs and uninspired art. While there is good art and the occasional basic concept to be found, they won't be on the same pages.There are several much better books on the same subject. If you must consider purchasing this volume, please get hold of a copy and flip through it first before committing to purchase.What drags this book up from the depths of uselessness is that it's a rough guide to the way PLEX designers think. If you need to sketch a couple of robots that mimick the simplistic PLEX look, this book gives you some design boundaries for avoiding too much mechanical elegance or visual appeal."
5,One of the greatest solos of guitar is here (Europa),"If you love great music, soft music, music to dance Santana is the guy, and with Europa you will be transported to a different world, Europa is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard, music to dance softly with your girlfriend, wife whatever,Great song, Great CD"
4,"A great CD, with great variety","I like this CD a lot because of the different styles. Let Me and Tell Me Are You Tired are great funky-R&B-like cuts, and really have that mid 70s classic style. Gitano is totally latino, and sounds just as fresh today. Dance Sister Dance is classic combo of latin-pop-fusion. Let It Shine is almost a gospel-sounding disco tune, and there is even a two-parter instrumental that starts off as an 'Incident at Neshbur' tune, but moves into a Coster-ish latino samba-like thing. Add Europa, a tune which still gets airplay in Paris, and the CD is a great mix.I also think the chicks dig this too, at least from my experience they do."
4,"A Great Santana, though definently not the best","This is a short (7 songs) Santana album that has two instantly recognizable hits (Dance Sister Dance and Europa), and while the other songs on this album don't fare guite as well as the previously mentioned two they are well worth a listen. Most notable of those songs is the accoustical Afro-Cuban sounding Gitano."
3,Let it shine,"Bought this album for Let it shine, which is always overlooked on compilations. This is a great disco track that sounds more like Isaac Hayes and Stevie Wonder than Santana. Europa and Dance sister dance are also great."
5,Get the regular CD,There was no point in making an edited version for this CD. The regular version has 1 swear word on the whole CD and there is nothing wrong with it. Get that CD it is much better. There is no point in having an Explicit Lyrics sticker on the regular version of the Fenix TX CD. Get that and no the clean version.
5,Why is it parental advisory?,"Maybe I heard the clean version but it dosen't seem like it should be, what is so bad about it? They are a great band and I would strongly recomend getting the CD!"
1,Pet barrette,"This is a pet barrette,this was not indicated in any way in thedescription. I thought it might be fine anyway but after openingit I discovered the clasp was broken. Very disappointing."
5,Tops,"It's hard to believe that no one has reviewed this gem of an album. The best thing about this work is the availability of the sheet music and I can attest, as one who has played every piece, that the writing is almost as great as the sound.I am not a Claude Bolling and my wife is not Rampal and we had no string bass or percussion...but it STILL sounded good. The first piece (Sentimental) is a good one to start out with in that it encapsulates the entire mood of the recording, Fugace and Love Themese are two more that seem to shimmer. Given that this was an early album, it is an outstanding success."
4,Pleasent surprise for a Telemovie...,"I had this movie originally on a rare LaserDisc, & was delighted when it appeared as a DVD release - in it's original aspect ratio & 16x9 enhanced to boot! The role of David Letterman is surprisingly accurate and after a while you forget this isn't the REAL Letterman. If you didn't know the story of how Letterman & Leno came to be where they are now in their career, it's a facinating incite into the harsh workings of corporate television. Worth the purchase price as you'll revisit this story often..."
4,Great (and timely) must see movie,"This is an HBO-made movie I originally saw back when it came out. I recently thought about it, as Jay Leno is preparing for his departure and David Letterman enters his 25th anniversary on late night television. I enjoyed it as much as I remember I did originally. And Kathy Bates is outstanding! I still like Letterman best, incidentally, but think it worked out best for all parties."
5,Very entertaining,Great insight into a well known television venue. From what I have found out this is a very close to accurate depiction of what transpired during the transition of the 'Carson' show. The actual story would need a lot more time to tell and this movie condenses it pretty good for the time allowed. The acting is great. Note that none of the main real life characters would dispute or comment on this film.
5,Waiting for the DVD!,"Please please please release ""The Late Shift"" on DVD!! Its a great movie, but we need the DVD (with perhaps some extras)!"
4,amazing raw acting,Amazing raw acting from the lead woman in all three movies. These performances are almost painfully real.
4,A Verow BOX SET!!!,"Once and Future Queen and Little Shots of Happiness were two of the first real low budget digital indie films. Both hold up very well in 2010. Both deal with women that are leaving the roles that society is trying to force into them. Both wind up learning and living (albeit- somewhat homeless!) way more than they bargained for. Philly and Bonnie Dickenson both shine in these features and both received acclaim and awards on the international film festival circuit for their gritty, vulnerable and strong performances. A Sudden Loss of Gravity meanders a bit but features a great soundtrack and an amazing 80's look and feel. Philly again steals the show as the aging New Wave singer, Margo-go-go who returns home to a small town to pick of the shrapnel of her decimated life. Great price for three of Todd Verow's most acclaimed works. He shoots on video so the movies are like news shows or documentaries, or gritty reality tv with an underground edge."
2,Not sure,I really am not sure what I saw why I bought this collection or why in the world someone actually produced these movies. I gave it 2 stars for balls not for merit
5,Great addition to Spin CD,"If you already bought Darren's Spin Cd,don't miss a great opportunity to hear 2 more great songs,""Ride"" and ""Falling at your feet ""will be great extention of the album!"
5,Best Thug Motivation Movie......,"This is the best ""thug motivation-type"" movie I've seen in a long time,eventhough it's been out for a long time now? I didn't even know it existed unitl Amazon put it in my recomemdations. It was worth buying and watching because it really brought out street survival. Although I didn't like the ending, because it left you wondering?"
2,TIFFANY!!!! Where art thou Tiffany?,"The opening, title and credit graphics were excellent. The overall film was, at the least, a decent portrayal of urban, African-American men fighting against the odds and obstacles to reach their dreams. However, one can also see from watching this film that urban life can have an unyielding hold on you. One bright spot, which is definitely a reason that this movie will be a staple on my video shelf, is the character of Tiffany. Not only was she one of the few characters in the movie that can actually act, that girl is fine as hell and her semi-nude scenes didn't hurt either. Get this movie if you like urban/gangster/rapper/shoot-em-up fare. And I know the TIFFANY character will have you watching over and over again."
2,What a let down !,"For years I have been listening to the CD version of Welcome to the pleasuredome,the Cd is well recorded with powerfull bass and punchy drums. When I saw that it was now out as a SACD multichannel disc I had to have it. This type of music is perfect for that. Boy was i shot down to find that the SACD versions of all the songs were different than the CD, washout versions from god knows what! The vocals are locked into the center channel and are dry as a camels [rear]! The versions on the CD ROCK what happened here? They should have just released WTTPD as a SACD. Save your money and if you dont own the CD buy that!FRANKIE SAY...... YOU GOT RIPPED OFF !!!"
4,Frankie SACD Is Very Good!!,"Ok, I had read the other reviews about this SACD before I bought it, and was not sure what to expect. I guess I must have a pretty good set up, because I was quite impressed. If you have a good system, say Sony ES amp or better, and high end speakers like Klipsch that are big, I mean real big....than you will love this Frankie SACD remixed in 5.1 by Trevor Horn. The center could be just a bit stronger on a few tracks. The long lp version of Welcome to the Pleasure Dome, well, it's just damn beautiful, period.If you want a better sounding Trevor Horn, ZTT label SACD that's down right incredible, get Propaganda's - A Secret Wish. Definately in the top 3 that I have as far as sound quality. The guy is an amayzing producer. I have been following his work for 28 years, starting with his lead vocals for Yes's Drama LP, to most of the ZTT label stuff he produced.I would recommend the purchase."
3,The Inside Track on the Coll Gang,"Published in 1955, ""Dark Plunder"" is a mostly factual, sometimes slightly fictionalized, account of the criminal career of Vincent ""Mad Dog"" Coll. Since this book was written more than fifty years ago, the author had access to a number of individuals who had played pivotal roles in the Coll saga, and it is reflected in these pages. Information gleaned from interviews with many of the detectives, prosecutors and others who were closely involved in this case make it a highly enjoyable read. This book contains a veritable gold mine of behind-the-scenes facts regarding what led to the apprehension and subsequent trials of Coll and his associates following the celebrated ""baby killing"" in East Harlem in the Summer of 1931. For this alone, it is recommended reading. I bought ""Dark Plunder"" out of curiosity and I was not disappointed. Hopefully, you'll find it just as enjoyable if you're lucky enough to obtain a copy."
2,What it the point?,"I oppose property politically and found this book completely unhelpful. Its arguments are, without exception, specious, Proudhon's style is verbose and graceless, and his answer to the question of the book's title a verbal wrangling which reduces the work to an attack a highly specific type of ownership in favour of another. Proudhon is no anarchist and no anarchist should look to this book for inspiration. It is of hitorical interest as a stage in the development of radical philosophy, nothing more."
2,Middlemarch Audiobook CD,"If you were nurtured on the original cassette recording read by Maureen O'Brian, do not expect the same quality of presentation on this recording. Maureen O'Brian was no doubt an actress par excellence and her presentation was lively and enthusiastic. She captured the different characters with such an artistry that this recent recording by Kate Reading falls flat beside it."
5,One of the best modern californian blues cd.,"Phillip Walker's recording career started in the late seventies with two amazing albums : ""Bottom of the top""[ASIN:B0000005OW] and ""Someday you'll have these blues"". By that time, Phillip Walker was at his best : deep ""throaty"" voice, brillant guitar playing, wonderful minor-keyed songs - some of them written by the smart and tasty producer Bruce Bromberg, who would later discover Robert Cray and Joe Louis Walker. Which one of these records is the best ? My favorite is the second one, for there are several gut-wrenching slow blues like ""Mama's gone"", ""Sure is cold"" and ""El Paso blues"", which is one of the most beautiful californian blues I ever heard."
2,Disappointing,"Lisa Randall has written a sometimes breezy and often vague book that specializes in sentiments like: If this is true, then all these other things might be true, too!Her expositions of Newton, Einstein and others do not compare favorably with her many predecessors. Her primers on gravity and relativity are memorable for their opacity. She has succeeded in being new and different, but not clearer and better.A reader interested in modern physics would be well advised to read Nobel Prize winner Robert Laughlin's book, ""A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down."" It is smarter and more insightful. His concept of emergence is very important."
2,Disappointing,"Though I seem to be in a minority, I thought it was poorly written. Confusing and full of gaps in the sense that metaphors are freely used, perhaps necessarily but without explanations regarding how they are merely metapors. E.g., if branes are like sheets of paper with space between them, how are they NOT like them? What is the nature of the space between them? Do they have shape? Are they finite or infinite? In what kind of space do they exist? If there are 3, call them a, b and c, sure a can touch b, but can c touch a? Again and again, I found myself thinking, ""But what about ... ? But you left out ... !"""
1,Disappointing,"I read a chapter in another book in which Lisa Randall was interviewed so I rushed out and got this book. What I found was very long preamble to a not terribly informative book full of references to well known books, pop culture, how NYC residents view themselves, and tidbits about Ms. Randall's life none of which was particularly interesting nor helpful.There is a lot of self love in this book. Unfortunately, the information could have been distilled down to a book one quarter its size and been better written, as well."
4,Review of Warped Passages,"Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden DimensionsAs a physicist, I find most of the popularized literature, not really understandable by the general public. Often references are made to highly technical issues which layman think they understand, but don't really. I think that Prof. Randall's book goes a long way in writing an understandable book for the layman along with being well written."
5,My gifted 12 year old son LOVED this book!,"I began reading this book to my dyslexic son last year when I had to pull him out of school to home school. Every day I would read several pages, stopping to explain things to him, and answer his questions. It was tremendous fun for both of us. Dr. Randall writes exceptionally clearly on topics that are often not presented clearly at all. She also has a great sense of humor, social connectedness, and love of learning and figuring things out. She has been a great role model for us as parents teaching our son, and for our son learning about how a physicist thinks. Highly recommended reading."
1,Should have re-read something or purchased another book.,"I don't mean to be critical of the author. This is strictly my personal experience with the book. I slogged through it, but did not enjoy it or get much out of it. I feel that my time would have been better spent re-reading something out of my library of Greene, Sagan, Ferris, Davies or Kirshner or buying something new by one of them. Those books were great fun to read and I got a great deal out of them.The Plank scale length notwithstanding, it still apppears that it's turtles all the way down."
5,Fascinating and charmingly written,"As one who enjoys struggling with modern concepts in physics - and causing mental meltdown in the attempt - I must commend ""Warped Passages"", a book I have thoroughly enjoyed, though I would never be arrogant enough to say I have understood. Despite John Gribbin's review in the Sunday Times, Dr Randall's writing style is both clear and charming . One suggestion would be that her next book include a bit more of the exotic mathematics which, I am sure, her editor required her to omit. Lisa Randall is a breath of fresh air in the realm of sharing the frontiers of physics today with those of us whose vocations place us in different places. I can heartily recommend this fine book to anyone with an interest in contemporary theoretical physics."
2,a time for sleeping,"Dr. Randall is no doubt very bright and knowledgeable, but needs an editor. This book was so long and explained things so many times that it ended up being confusing.I have studied theoretical physics for years and have a large library of qualitative and quantitative books on physics and mathematics and I know that this book will not be part of my collection. Wonderful ideas, but stated in an amateurish, repetitive manner. Have you attended or sat through one of her classes at Harvard? If so, you know that there are other ways to be put to sleep other than medication. Anyways, check it out."
3,Need a happy median between this book and Penrose's new book,As much as I admire the author's work - I can only give a review of 3 stars because there is too much of an aversion to using mathematics ( without which theoretical physics cannot really be understood). There needs to be a happy medium between this book and penrose's new book. Something like the Pea and the Sun a book which actually proves the Banach-Tarski paradox at a level which the non-expert can understand. Also please correct the Pi's in Maxwell's equations in the notes at the end of the book.
4,"well-written, enlightening, lengthy","The author articulates the science in lay terms very well. Her specialty is particle physics, but she gives equal treatment to general relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, and particle physics. I read a lot of books about one or the other of these subjects, but this is the one that best describes the state of the art in each one of them, and how they complement each other (or not). This one reads easier, and the author makes great use of metaphors and analogous ideas that help you understand some of the tenets of a very complicated subject matter.The book is lengthy and comprehensive, but the author gives suggestions about which sections you can skip if you are not as interested in that part, and key points are summarized at the end of every chapter for those you want to skip."
4,What a Trip!!!,This book was a trip. While there is a lot of technical information there is a lot to be learned from the author. She walks through the concepts of string theory and multidimensional theory in a very fun and inventive way. There are areas that you can easily skip and not lose a beat and the author will tell you when she is going to give more information or go off on a tangent and what you will be able to skip.If this is your first time reading about string theory or extra dimensions then I would not recommend this personally. I think having a base to start from will go a long way to ensuring that you comprehend what is being discussed because there are some new concepts that are presented.It took me much longer to get through this book than I had imagined only due to the technical nature and the times I had to re-read sections after putting the book down for a day or two.
4,A++ for effort,"I was very excited to read this book because of the advanced topics discussed. I want to thank and commend Lisa Randall for taking on the difficult challenge to present leading edge work at the popular science level. Fantastic and 10 stars for the effort.The downside I felt as a reader was that because she covers so many topics, each topic necessarily can't get the treatment it deserves and as a result, many of the discussions are more like descriptions rather than trying to explain and give physically intuitive pictures to understand the phenomena. (of course, for QA, things aren't quite intuitive). I just finished reading Brian Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" and felt he did a much better job ""explaining"" and discussing these topics. The real meat of the book is her work in extra dimensions and I think much more time should have been spent on that topic with explanations to QM, GR done as (longish) footnotes as various topics/ideas were needed."
3,A nice introduction for physics students,"Why leave all the interesting math out of a book like this?It's nicely written, of course - nothing particularly new or original conceptually, and is good for physics students to use as a wordy and clear introduction to a fascinating topic.But I think most of the intended readership could cope with an outline of the fascinating math (and some of its complexities) as they read - even if it is put into boxes to one side of the text - or in an Appendix or two. Maybe in a 2nd edition?"
3,Warped Passages,"Despite what was perceived on the author's part to be an effort to explain complicated theory for the layman, this book would probably appeal more to persons with a good background in physics, than to persons basically untrained but interested in physics and grasping at the concepts. The author's style was refreshing; she was not pedantic as writers of such books often are."
5,Great Book,"I have read many books on relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics and classical physics. This book gives the best comprehensive overview of the existing theories that I have ever read. The book is extremely well-written in that it simplified the theories to the point that they are easy to understand through classic analogies. Some of them are quite cute. I love the lyric choices at the beginning of each chapter. I cannot wait for the Large Hadron Collider to be operational. If you do not know what the LHC is, BUY and read this book...PS Beautiful Author"
1,Boring,"A very boring read. I am a scientist myself. Physics is not my field and I wanted to broaden my horizon... it did not work. Just give me a Sam Harris, a Richard Dawkins or a Malcom Gladwell.EDIT: fixed typos: boaded -> broaden (yeah, I was asking for that response of yours, Steve)"
1,Unable to make it work on Windows 7,"I don't give it a bad review because it is bad. I don't know how it is since I've been unable to make it work on windows 7 nor have I found any help online. So... unless you know how to make it work, don't spend your money on this."
4,Not What Metal Heads Think Is Goth...,"Not what metal heads think is goth (cradle of filth, type o negative, ministry, etc.) if you think those bands are goth your not looking at the right stuff. this here is more of an addition for anyone who owns the uber awsome 'goth box' set. classic goth bands with some of the newer stuff mixed in. kind of bridges the gap between the old goth (christian death, the lorries, corpus delicti) with the new brand of goth (razed in black, alien sex fiend) and everything inbetween (mission uk, inkubus sukkubus, children on stun, march violets). ..."
2,this is not goth - but what do you care,"this is not 'goth' if 'goth' can be defined. definitely one can taste the post-punkness in the songs here. i actually don't recognize most of the bands on the album!! i'd say even the cocteau twins is more goth than this. to be goth, it has to be dark, beautiful, sensitive, morbid, and healthy (so you can keep on being suicidal)."
2,Definitly goth not gothic however,"This compilation is definitly the new age goth stuff, but it is not gothic at all. Most of this is techno and just terrible music. Its really hard to find a good true gothic band these days, and most of these bands on here are not gothic. I do not recommend this cd and to anyone who wants to hear a real gothic band listen to Type O Negative."
2,....Not.,"Ok, this is not Goth. This is not quite Techno, but many of the selections are closer to Techno than to Goth. But not even good Techno. A couple songs might be considered Trance, or even Club.. My daughter calls it ""C.S.I. waiting to happen"". Granted, I did not listen to all 3 CDs yet. I was only able to take it in small quantities. Not sure I will play this more than once. I was really looking for something much more along the lines of Cradle of Filth.. Oh well. At least it was cheap.My suggestion: Skip this one, and ask a friend to recommend something better."
1,Disappointed,This brand new polarizer was very dusty and had a blemish on the edge of the glass that looked like an etched water spot. I was very surprised because I thought B&W had an excellent reputation-I've been very happy with two of their diopters.I returned the polarizer to Amazon.
3,Servicable introduction,"This was a helpful text but not one of my favorites. It dealt in two parts with the geology and biology of BC. My interest was primarily with the former, though they seemed to do a fine job with the latter. The text is full of bright color photography, however (not unlike most geological texts aimed at the popular reader) it does not include nearly enough diagrams depicting the formative influences and pertinent orogenies. ($23 is pretty steep.)"
1,Datapilot not so great,"The program wouldn't recognize my new phone even after buying an additional cable, so the number transfer wouldn't work either, that being the main feature I wanted. Addionalty the customer service did not answer repeated requests for info. Not at all worth the money."
5,This monitor has worked excellent over time,If you find this tv/monitor: BUY IT...I believe it was an excellent buy.did not like the R/C...but really never used it.
3,"OK, but not great, standard TV","Rough picture (grainy) with standard cable. With standard cable, standard quality CRTs are superior.Good picture using svideo input.Good as small PC monitor.Terrible remote - must have been a challenge to design a remote this bad. No keys, just bumps in the plastic."
5,"good clean fun. ok, just fun.","I love this dvd...i watch it quite often! It's a nice 'behind the scene' sort of thing. Including: billie spanking, kissing and burning people, this dvd is a must for any green day fan. There's only one live performance for each band (green day, blink, jimmy..) and several snippets, but it's well worth your money. I am now a Kut U Up fan."
5,The MTV viewing was too short,"I saw this tour when it rolled thru Chicago on June 15, 2002. Not sure if I saw Kut U Up or not, I don't remember. But Green Day put on the best show ever. And Blink sucked live of course, but the 15,000 teenyboppers didn't know that (I felt like I was at a Beatles concert cos they were screaming their heads off, but in a higher pitch which was annoying in its own right). Anyway, this movie is great. Sucks Tre Cool wasnt in it as much (i think he was in like 5 shots), but Billie Joe and Mike kicked ass. The aformentioned butt prodding was hilarious. I think the most serious-ish moment was Billie walking (drunk, of course) to his hotel room with the chandelier in his arm. I want to go on tour like this with my band and just have fun 24-7."
5,DUUUUUUUUDE,"okay this dvd is freakin hilarious. i also bought it after seeing the mtv special. theres so much crazy stuff in this video, its ridiculous. definitely definitely get it for yourself for xmas."
5,Funniest crazy video ever,"This is the funniest video i have ever seen! i saw the tour of this dvd so naturally i had to get it, it was an awesome tour and seeing the behind the scenes madness made it even better! if you like green day and blink and fun you'll love this video!"
1,Slow,"This writing feels stoic. I bought it because I have seven children and my home always feels like a noisy village. After choking down three chapters, we had to put it down. It is written from a small girls perspective. I was hoping for something more well rounded"
2,Wasn't what I had hoped...,"After avidely reading the first 8 books of the Cheney series and discussing every plot detail with my best friend, I was sorely dissapointed in reading this novel. Gone was the wit and banter that made Shiloh and Cheney the characters I had grown to love... their dialog seemed contrived and their actions predictable. I was sure a major plot would be in this book, as book 8 of the series wrapped up the wedding so quickly. Unfortunatly, I agree with another review posted, that this story could have been summed up in one more chapter at the end of the previous book."
2,What a Disaster!,"I loved the Cheney Duvall series and had high expectations for The Inheritance, but after finally reading it, I was bitterly disapointed. The Inheritance is missing a lot of things that made the Cheney Duvall series so great. Foremost, it was missing adventure. All they do is float around in Shiloh's ship. I suppose this is allowable since it is their honeymoon, but still, the setting makes out for a terribly boring book. No new notable characters were introduced and none of the old, memorable ones ever showed up. In my opinion, the only interesting part of the book was Bain's story."
1,Where Two Seas Met,"I obviously did not look at the description of this book as thoroughly as I should have. I felt the characters attitudes and speech were not of the time period of the book's setting. It seems to me to be badly written and unbelievable. Perhaps I should have read more reviews and realized this is truly a work of fiction with no basis of factual events, real or imagined. I feel I have wasted my time and money."
2,Could have done better.,"I think Where Two Seas Met has been vastly overrated. Watch out kids, your hopes will be dashed.The characters were stiff and phony, behaving entirely unlike themselves. It took me three weeks to get past chapter eight.I had high hopes for this new series, believing nothing could be worse than the rushed wedding of Driven With the Wind- well, I was wrong.I'm sure Gilbert and Lynn had nice intentions, and I commend them for their time. I just think they could have done a WHOLE lot better. The feeling I got from the book was as if somebody else had written it. Like it had a rough outline with things they were forced to write in, like ""mon chou"".I'm sorry, kids. I'm just as disappointed as you."
3,Oedipus complex story,"This is not a fairy tale; it's about Caillou wanting to marry his mother. The prince and dragon are involved in Daddy's tale to explain why he can't. Decent story, but I had no idea of the subject matter and was looking for more of a make-believe he's a prince type of story."
4,Nice overview,"Wall's book is broken up by philosopher, instead of topic, and ranges from the Greeks (Plato and Aristotle), through the Medievals (Augustine and Aquinas), into the moderns and post-moderns. There is more concentration on the moderns and post-moderns (Descartes, Kant, Freud, Marx, Sartre), as well as two chapters on modern scientific views. Wall's chapters include extensive presentation, and then excerpts from the actual texts. Those excerpts are good, but somewhat limited. Walls presentation is excellent--he writes clearly and in a very inviting style, and not too technical. I used this as a text for a class, and had excellent results with my students."
3,Bill Wyman is NOT retired!,"You can't believe everything you read. Mr. Wyman was recently interviewed on a radio show where I live, and he is quite happily involved in a band he deliberately does not want to get big called The Rhythm Kings so he can stay close to his family's home and not drag them out on the road. He also likes to indulge in archeology when he's on his land, no doubt the same place he dug up some of the old, egomaniacal relics who are sorely misinformed about everything they write because they are so in love with themselves."
4,Best proof for LDS revisionism,"The Tanner's magnum opus has been around in different versions since the sixties (I have a 1972 edition). While I may stipulate that Mormonism - Shadow or Reality? isn't a scholarly work, I'm impressed with the sincerity and general honesty of the writers. Mr. and Mrs. Tanner's greatest contribution to history is their unceasing effort to gather and publish source material which the LDS church has modified over the years beyond recognition. The LDS church would say that a living prophet is better than a dead one, and that any changes have been authorized by God through His servants. Perhaps, but if that's not enough for you, the Tanners give you some of the material you need to come to your own conclusion.The LDS church itself teaches that ""by the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of all things."" They should let history stand where it is, without the tampering.I'm 40 years old and served a 2 year LDS mission to Chile."
1,"""Tannerism"": Shadow or Reality?","I was always taught if you are going to undertake a job you should see it all the way through, obviously the Tanners never learned this lesson. They quoted many original witnesses of the Book of Mormon, but never fully. This book stands upon snips and clips which the Tanners have attempted to glue together into a book. If you have questions about Mormons, read the Book of Mormon or ask of God for your own witness."
4,Enjoyable,I found the mix of paganism and religion a change from the norm and battle scenes fun. Princess Elizabeth would have been dead when attacked by 50 armed men but for the woodwitches interceding. In the beginning of the story she is a spoiled brat but by the end she has come into her own. Throughout the book she is more concerned about her country than herself even if she is in search of a husband.
2,i am a melodic animal,"yes i need some kind of melody - maybe just bits of melody. No matter if there is no lead melodic line make by a lead instrument - something harmolodic which is something in the middle between harmony and melody are essential to me to call whatever i am listening to - music.Ok it is just a question of Taste.As reviewer Matthew Mercer of Chicago says, here you can't find any trace of melody.Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts."
5,OB/GYN Must Have,"This book is a must have for any clinician working with Obstetrics and Gynocology. This pocket sized reference covers critical topics and provides immediate answers to questions of issues that arise for anyone working with female patients. The book has easy to read algorithms and charts, information on all aspects of Gyn practice, including uro-gynocology and oncologic staging."
3,Could be better...,"For this book, you need a magnifying glass to read it! The print is way too small. It's okay to use when accompanied with a textbook but not great on its own. Additionally, I think it's out of date and not up to ACOG standards. Of the entire 5 week rotation, I picked up this book once!"
4,inexpensive trip to a french village.,"Jeff Greene is doing what the rest of us dream about doing. I found this book to be enchanting. His descriptions of the village physical are so stimulating. I have a sister living in a small village in France so I found so many similarities between his village and my sister's village. The characters are wonderful, full of life. The next time I visit my sister I will surely stop in Rogny and see for myself Jeff Greene's dream."
1,ONE BORING BOOK,"I was expecting a true romance story filled with intrigue and adventure, but instead I got a boring lifeless story that could put any heart-thumping human to sleep. I have never been so frustrated with a book as I have with this one. I wanted the story to move forward from page one, but till the end the narrative just got slower, slower and zzzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,Then what?,"I just finished French Spirits and then read other reviews. It never occurred to me that the author was being a braggard. The story is full of real characters and the author's acceptance and appreciation of their quirks is obvious. My only complaint is that this swift read ends abruptly. There are implications that his mother does not continue to live with them in France, but we never learn what happens to her. Surely there is a sequel, but perhaps more life has to be lived before he will be ready to write it. I will certainly be waiting."
1,Haier 46b wine cellar?,"Unfortunatly, I can't give a legitimate rating AND will never know if this is a decent wine cellar because it arrived TWICE (yes, I took the change and re-ordered) damaged and delivery-the second time-was refused.I finally canceled my order and bought a GE Monogram for 2X the amount, which holds up to 57 bottles. (I own a smaller 20b Haier and have had no problems with it in three year.)But the larger 46b: BUYER BEWARE! It is not packaged to protect it during shipping and will sustain significant damage if dropped or hit on the sides. I learned my lesson the hard way: twice!"
3,"It helps, but is also uncomfortable","I have been using this for about a month now. It does help with the back pain, but not as much as I would have liked, and I feel like I am constantly having to adjust it. When I sit down, it folds over, so when I stand up I have to unfold it and adjust it. It does help though if you have to be on your feet a lot. We took the older kids to the fair grounds and I was walking around with them all afternoon without much back pain (if any at all). My main complaint is just that it isn't very comfortable to wear for long periods of time."
4,It works,"I was skeptical that this belt will reduce or prevent from lower back pain due to pregnancy. Believe me.., it works. I wear it everywhere. I wear normally small size, however, i bought medium size belt because of the other reviewers' recommendation. Medium size was a bit big for me, but it can be adjusted. I would recommend this product."
2,Didn't help my round ligament pain,"If you bought this for some other reason than to help with round ligament pain due to pregnancy, skip to the next review. I bought this belt because I began suffering significant round ligament pain, to the point that walking was extremely painful, around 20 weeks of pregnancy. In particular, for me, it seems to be severely exacerbated by jogging or running.I purchased this belt after surfing around Amazon looking at the various maternity belt options. This one is definitely one of the smallest options of the bunch, and also one of the cheapest. Unfortunately, after trying it out for a few days, I really don't think it's helped me at all. The round ligament pain is as bad as ever. Perhaps it would be worse without the belt as my pregnancy is progressing - who knows.The belt itself is well-made and easy to put on. I am 22 weeks pregnant and 140 lbs or so currently, and I found the size Small fits on the smallest setting."
2,Not comfortable,"I found this to be very uncomfortable, I am a nurse and am on my feet for over 12 hours a shift and I ended up taking it off the first night within just a few hours of wearing it. I also couldn't sit down with it on, it pressed into my belly and just hurt!"
3,Too big...,"I'm 30 weeks pregnant and have been suffering really bad back and hip pains. My doctor suggested getting a maternity belt. After reading the reviews and the fact that this belt had hooks instead of velcro (I didn't want to ruin my cloths), I decided to go with this product. I also decided to buy a size S instead of P because of the review. I should have purchased the P. The size S is too big to provide any support. I'm petite (weigh 110 at 30 weeks (92 pre-pregnancy)) and have small hips. For me, I should have ordered based on the size chart. If you have small hips, you should definitely order based on the size chart. It would be helpful if the size chart included hip measurements."
5,Great relief,"I am 5 and 1/2 week pregnant, and I have started to experience a strong continuous pain at the bottom of the abdomen (it's the ""round ligament pain"" , very common I also had it during my previous pregnancy, bt this time it has started much earlier!...).I found on Amazon this product, and I was attracted by its small size.The belt is magnificent, it's providing me releif from the first minute I put it on. I use it only when I need to stand or walk, and remove it when I am sitting, since I don't need it and can be a bit uncomfortable (or needs to be opened a bit).Its small size and easiness of use means that I can easily put it on and off, and keep it in my purse. And that it is invisible under the suits and clothes.When I wear the belt the pain disappears almost entirely, and I have been told by doctors that it also helps stopping the progression of pain.Great releief, and great value for money."
4,Great Back Saver,"I have carried this baby so low from the beginning. I started noticing low back pain and pelvic pain in the 5th month. This product was recommended to me and this was a GREAT investment. It does get slightly uncomfortable for the low belly towards the end of the day, but it really does save my back. It holds the belly up so that the baby is supported. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is carrying low or is experiencing low back pain.I don't weigh 181-225 lbs... when I purchased this, I was about 160 lbs. The belt has 3 clasp settings. I am glad I didn't get the smaller one."
4,Great product - sizing issue,"I definitely agree that their sizing was off for me. I am at the high end of what they call a small, but I ordered a medium based on other reviews and it fits great right now on the smallest setting. I'll be able to continue using this as my belly continues to grow. (I'm 5 months pregnant.) Otherwise, it's comfortable and serves its purpose to give a little (not a lot) of back and abdominal support."
4,Good Belt,"This is a pretty good belt, it supports you and really helps if you have a lot of walking to do. They only thing I wish is that it was more adjustable with more hooks. Other than that I would highly recommend it."
4,"Good Medium Support, but not for the bouncy belly","I purchased this product for support while walking on the treadmill. It works great now (Second Trimester), but I don't know if it will hold up to my bouncy belly in the 3rd. All in all, it was money well spent."
1,Sizing way off!,"Everyone reviewing this product said to size one up. I did and it was huge. I could not exchange, just return and was charged shipping. My belly support from Amon just arrived and thankfully it does fit according to the size chart and seems much more supportive for the whole belly."
2,sizing is way off,"I purchased the It's You Babe Mini Cradle, size small. At 5'3"" and a current weight of 152lbs, I ordered the SMALL because according to the size chart it ranges from 136-180lbs. I am almost 35 weeks and have already stopped gaining weight (the same thing happened with my first pregnancy). I was afraid the medium would be too large since I am not anywhere close to 180. I should have listened to the other reviewers! The second to last clasp was way to tight. I put it on the last clasp and it fit, but just barely. If I gain any more weight or if my stomach drops anymore this would not fit. I adjusted the position several times thinking maybe it was in the wrong spot but no such luck. I ended up having a weird crampy fealing both times I tested it out and haven't bothered with it since. The company needs to change their size chart so it's based on your stomach circumference. Then maybe people would have an easier time getting the right fit."
4,Good enough,It was good when I was from 5 to 7 month but then I had to buy wide belt with back support because this one did not help with low back pain.
3,Helps a little,"Definitely follow the lbs chart and not the sizing. I bought a large because that is the size pants I wear, but this cradle is slightly large on me. It is not uncomfortable, but I definitely wouldn't call it comfortable either. It seems to alleviate some back pain since I am on my feet walking all day at work. I don't wear it everyday, but I do wear it on days that my back pain feels really bad and I need some extra support. I am now 31 weeks pregnant and may find that I will need it even more later. Good price though for the item."
4,Good Quality,I got this for my wife and she bought another one recommended by her obgyn but we kept this one also. She used it once and liked it.
2,Too Big,"After reading the reviews, I purchased a size up as many reviewers said this product ran small. I'm 33 weeks and weigh 170 pounds and decided to order the medium. It is definitely too big. It does not fall off, it stays on, but even on the tightest hook setting, it doesn't actually give me any support. I don't use it at all at this point. I should have just ordered the Small based on the product's weight chart."
4,good value,"I got this on my 21 week, 139bl. With other people's review, I bought the one size up, and it is totally correct. I am using the smallest setting right now, and this belt will give me plenty growing room. One thing I do not like (I guess it is related to my job)is it is not comfortable if you like me, sitting all the day. But it does lighter my back stress. Would recommend it. It is made in US."
1,just useless,"this band does not give you any support, It is just useless. I returned it immediately. Would not recommend it."
3,"Fits true to size, not enough support","Contrary to other reviews, I found that this belt fits true to size. I am size 4-6 pre-pregnancy, at 32 weeks gained 20 lbs. Medium was too large, Small was just right. However, I ended up returning the belt because I didn't feel like it provided enough support. I ended up getting the Medela one, which provides more coverage and support. Velcro is also better for customized fit, the three options of the eye and hook didn't give me the right fit."
5,Prenatal Cradle,"My wife love this item, without this it was hard for her to walk or stand for long time."
2,Too narrow and useless,"I guess it'd be fine if you're only at 4 or 5 months, but beyond that, it's too narrow and provides no support."
5,Highly recommended!!,Highly recommend this maternity belt to those who are experiencing back pain. Really helps the minute you put it on.
2,Ok...,Didn't give the back support I was really looking for - sizing was a little off as well. This helped some while sleeping at night.
5,"Omg, this has been a life (belly) saver","I'm at 32 weeks now and my belly tends to get really heavy and uncomfortable so i decided to use this. It has definitely eased the pain of gravity that's been pulling on my belly but best of all, it helps to relieve my sciatic pain too. I walk around a lot for my job so this has been a life saver.In regards to the sizing, mine fit perfectly. For those that were complaining that the fit was 'too small', perhaps you just got the wrong size. Eitherway, Amazon makes it so easy to return so it shouldn't be a big deal."
3,Ehhhh ....,It's OK. Should of ordered a size bigger and well then again it doesn't give much support. I'm carrying really low and it doesn't help at all. Next time ill buy the full belly support one instead.
4,It does what it is supposed to do!,This belt eases back pain but only when you are using it while standing. It's so painful to sit or drive while using it
2,Don't bother!,This belt didn't seem to do anything for me.I don't feel more support. I am glad that I read reviews prior to buying this item because you really do need to get one size up otherewise it will be too small.
3,Buy in current size not pre-preg size,"Best to buy this in your current weight range and not pre-preg size! I'm a pants size 6/8 that would make me a Small but the Smalls don't fit me, the Medium is just about right, in my 3rd trimester I am weighing over 180 lbs. While this belt gives excellent support it is best used if you're standing or walking for long periods of time for work or shopping perhaps. If you're going to be seated for long periods it won't do justice as it digs into flesh either at the edges or fold over and compress your belly at the fold which can be very painful especially if you had a c-section before. If you're gonna be seated for long periods, or lying down, may I suggest the Medela Maternity Support because it's softer and more breathable. I just wished this belt came in skintone friendly colors as white sticks out like a sore thumb if I don't tuck it in my pants properly."
2,Nice but I could not use it,"This band can provide back support if you are not experiencing any other issues due to pregnancy. My abdominal discomforts, especially sharp round ligament pain got worse with the band. And also, because of the pressure, I felt the urge to run to the restroom every half hour. But of course, if you are having a pain-free very comfy pregnancy, and just looking for back support, this band could be for you.The sizing info is a bit tricky. I am 5'6"" and my pre-pregnancy size was 0-2 (occasionally 4) or XS-S. Now that I'm passed midway, I hit 136lbs, I got the size S following the chart. There is no way I could fit into smallest setting. The medium setting provided support while giving more room for the future. I think I would use the largest setting at the end of my pregnancy, but I ended up returning it because of the discomfort I had."
5,Lifesaver!,"Began using the Mini Cradle about 3 weeks ago after suffering from severe round ligament pain and pulled muscles after being on my feet for 12 hour shifts. It has really helped support my growing tummy/uterus and helps absorb a lot of movement from my constant walking. I haven't had a ton of back pain yet during the pregnancy (I'm 30 weeks now) but maybe thats because I've been wearking the Mini Cradle for a month!!Either way, it is kind of a pain to wear the mini cradle for 12+ hours at a time, but when I'm home and can take it off I REALLY notice a difference in the pelvic, round ligament, and abdominal muscle pain that I was having before. The muscle aches haven't totally gone away, but have vastly improved!I'd recommend this to anyone who's been bothered by strained abdominal muscles and/or round ligament pain due to being on your feet for long periods of time!"
1,No thought given to design,"The band was made of very hard, uncomfortable elastic. It was poking me and binding. It should have been covered in some sort of fabric. Further, the hook and eye closures were very far apart making it difficult to get a comfortable fit. The belt was either too lose or too tight. Babies R Us has a mini belt with a velcro closure that is a much better design."
1,Very Limited,"This belt was absolutely useless for my wife. her size fell between the 2 settings. it was either too tight or too loose.Though the idea of having the hooks seems like a good idea, it's not as easy as velcro."
3,Seems like it hurts more than helps,"I just got this and have tried to wear it a few times. Everytime i have worn it soon after i get pain down low. I guess i will keep it for when i get bigger, right now i'm 31 weeks. It feels better as soon as i take it off."
3,It's ok,"I was looking for more support than this provided. It's not bad, just not what I needed. If you're looking for a very supportive belt than this ones not the one, but for a little support it does help"
3,Too big,"I read many of the reviews before I purchased this product. I decided to get the size that I currently am, and that was a large. The large is too big. I should have gotten a medium. Otherwise the product worked good. I would have loved to send it back, but then I would have to pay for shipping again."
3,Not really what I expected.,"Maybe I didn't pay attention to this item when I ordered it but it is really just an 3"" elastic band with bra hooks sewn in. When I put it on (and it wasn't tight) my refux started up really strong and my lower back started throbbing. Its happened every time I use it but I guess thats better than my entire back going into spasms which it has been doing every day for a month. The size seems true to their description and I have plenty of extra inches left for the last two months of my pregnancy. The only thing I am noticing so far is that it does provide a bit of lift for my stomach. Maybe there is a breaking-in time for this but the two days of use might be the only it gets."
5,Belly Belt,"This belly belt saved me during the last half of my pregnancy. I think at my largest I was 47"" around the lower part of my belly."
4,good,The prenatal cradle is really good! It really does support back and lift stomach! Its jus a lil uncomfortable with clothes! Other than that its good!!
4,Great Support Band,"I am very pleased with this band. In my first pregnacy, I found myself needing additional support during my workouts. I purchased a very wide support belt with velcro. It was extremely uncomfortable during workouts because of it's stiff structure. I through it away after my son was born. Now, I'm pregnant with my second baby, and needed another support band for working out. This band is so comfortable. Sometimes I forget that its even there. I like the elastic support, which my previous support belt didn't have. I also like the fact that it's not too wide. It's perfect in width. You can wear it under clothes without it being too noticeable. I am 6 months pregnant and have a medium band. I'm currently weighing in at about 160 lbs. The medium fits very comfortably and I think it will be ok for the remainder of the pregnancy. As others have stated in their previous posts, had I gone with the small, it probably would have been too tight and not lasted my entire pregnancy."
3,Went next size up and it was too big,"I had read the other reviews and most said to go to the next size up as this item ran small, wish I didn't because the one I got was a large and it's too big so it doesn't support me correctly. I think if I did go with the medium, I would probably be thrilled with this item but because it's too big, I do not get the support I need."
3,"Comfortable, offers some support","I had been having sever upper back pain when I purchased this belt. It does seem to offer some support for my belly, but doens't seem to ease my back pain much at all. It is quite comfortable though, I am able to sit down or drive in the car with it on. I ordered a medium and I have to wear it on the tightest setting - I weigh ~ 170 pounds at 7 months pregnant, wore a size 6 / 140 pounds pre-pregnancy. So I probably should have gone by the official product sizing as opposed to the advice that it runs small. The seam on one of the hook and eyes is already coming loose (started to come loose after only 1 or 2 wears) so I am going to have to sew it. Overall, not a bad maternity belt for the price, comfortable and supportive but didn't help much with the back pain."
3,"If it fits, it helps.","I made the mistake of ordering size too small. I normally weigh 100 lbs. I only weighed 124 when I ordered it...but the strap was WAY too tight-- it hurt-- I survived the first day, and actually felt pressure relief, but haven't been able to wear them since. I think a bigger size would have made all the difference."
4,"Great product, but check the sizing.","I bought this maternity belt when I was 28 weeks pregnant with my third child. It greatly reduced back and belly strain and made moving much more comfortable again. The price is amazing for what you are getting! The belt is very strong and closes securely. It was very easy to conceal under clothing too. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the sizing. I am a very petite person (90 lbs pre-pregnancy, currently 111 lbs at 32 weeks pregnant)so I bought the petite sized belt. At 28 weeks I was already on the largest setting and am now too large to fit the belt at 32 weeks. I am going to purchase the next size up because I think an extra $15 is worth the benefits provided by the belt, but save yourself the trouble and just order the next largest size in the first place."
2,not what i was expecting,"after reading all the reviews i thought this would be the perfect thing for my back pain and was quick to purchase it for some relief but after i reccieved it and tried it, fail! it was not what i was expecting it hurt to wear it and it was very unconfortable! dont wate your money!"
3,NOt what I expected,This Maternity belt was OK. I followed the reviews of the rest of the people who bought it and I decided to purchase the medium. I was 165lbs at the time of purchase. This was too big. I needed something that held my belly up with a bit more strength!I tried the V2 supporter and it worked wonders!!! Worth every penny I spent on it.
5,Love it,Love this! Better then the medula! Like that it's not Velcro. Really gives great support. Totally recommend. Weigh 165 and got medium. Fits great
2,Bad Fit,"I purchased this and the Boppy Maternity Support Band at the same time - and I'm 31 weeks pregnant, with some ongoing feelings of thigh pain and belly pressure. For me, the mini cradle was ill-fitting, as many other reviewers have said. The largest hook-and-eye setting was just too large, and the medium setting was far too small. Additionally, the band was uncomfortable, and I was not able to find a position that worked for me.The Boppy band was much more supportive, and it's extra width helped lift my belly more evenly than the Mini Cradle, which put a lot of pressure on one area. I'm planning to return this product."
2,Uncomfortable... returning,"The size does run small, so I ordered the next size up. I was eagerly waiting for the support belt, but was disappointed on day one because the material the band is made of is uncomfortable, and dug into my skin when i was sitting. It did its job, but it was so uncomfortable that i will be returning it and looking for another one with softer and more comfortable material."
4,hold me up!,"when my belly really started getting big, I needed the extra support because it was getting heavy!! This ""belt"" does do the trick. I did have to adjust the clasps because if I used the center clasps, it'd be too tight, if I used the last set of clasps, it was too big. So I stitched a row of clasps right in the middle and its perfect! (had I known how easy it was, I would've just made my own instead of purchasing, but hey--live and learn!)I've recommended this ""cradle"" already to friends who are especially carrying ""low""."
1,Spend the extra $ on something that's more adjustable,"I bought this for extra support on walks. This thing was horrible. It was nothing more than an elastic with pins. THere is very little room for adjustment. In addition, the one I received was stained. I ended up returning this and buying something with velcro."
2,Worthless,"Getting a lot of pressure in the abdomen with my twin pregnancy and this belt was recommended by a friend. I thought I would like it because it is simple and can be hidden between the pants and shirt. First, it runs super small. I got a medium, which was a size larger for me and wish it had been a large. There are three settings on it and by the 20th week with my twins, I was already on the last setting. Tried to put up with it numerous times, but it seems to add to the pressure. My doctor has since suggested getting one with a harness."
1,Not worth it!,I dont know if it's just me or what but I found this belt to provide no extra support what so ever. Save your money or invest into a belt thats worth it.
3,Worked until last 6 weeks of Pregnancy!,"It was ok for a while but as I got further along it did not do much, prob better to invest in a higher quality if you have back probs:)"
2,Returned it,"I believe I tried this during my second trimester. I found it to be uncomfortable, and it provided no support. Waste of time and money."
2,Too Small,"I ordered a size small, and it's too small (even on the largest setting). The other reviews indicating that the belt runs small are correct. Except that I *just* hit 130 pounds, and their ""small"" size says it goes from ""136 - 180 lbs"". It is ridiculous that their sizes should be *that* inaccurate. I'm returning it, and going to buy one in a store that I can try on."
5,It works-- but buy the next size up!,Just what I needed in the third trimester for support. Was having trouble standing and walking around due to the 35 lb baby load but this belt is helping a lot. Suddenly everything is not so exhausting. Great buy for $15! Agree with other reviewers that buying a size up from what you think you need is probably best. I'm petite but purchased the small size-- very glad I did as I'm using the largest notch on the small belt. The petite probably wouldn't have fit at all.
2,For now...,"I'm only 17 weeks but wanted to try this out because I am already having sciatica. I ordered the medium based on other reviews saying the sizing was extremely small. I'm 5'8"" pre pregnancy 145 lbs...now 155...the smallest setting is very uncomfortably tight and huge on the mid setting...it is pretty worthless to me for now (maybe when I'm a little bigger...) I ended up getting the Babies R Us support belt...it's got a lot more fabric but is extremely comfortable and fits properly."
4,Can't go without this!,This belt is very supportive. My baby is sitting so low in my belly and this is the perfect thing to help with the pressure of carrying so low. I would definitley size up though!I just received my small and I am on the last hook already (I was 145 prior to pregnancy and 160 currently). I love it so much though I just ordered the medium. Definitely recommend.
3,"Not a miracle worker, but helps","I bought this for my wife. As she entered her third trimester she started having symphysis pain. Her Gyne suggested the mini cradle. We wanted to try the basic first before investing in a full support model. She has definitely seen improvement during the day. The night time stiffness and pelvic ""popping"" did not however stop. Its just been few days of trying.have to see if it improves over timeAlso please remember one size up! According to the chart wife needed a small, but we stuck to the reviews and bought the medium. Fits her very nicely for her third trimester"
4,Great Product,"Great product, sizing does run slightly small. I purchased this item since it was not as big and bulky as others for sale. Received item quickly after ordering."
1,So uncomfortable,"This was the worst thing ever! I understand that it would need to be rigid enough to offer support, but this thing dug into my hips so bad! I had it on for 5 minutes before I took it off and sent it back. Look elsewhere for something different!"
4,It works,"Who would have thought that something so simple could provide so much relief? I am 33 weeks pregnant and was suffering from back pain. I ordered this item at 30 weeks and it relieved my back pain the first day I used it. I wish I would have ordered it sooner. I generally wear it over my maternity clothes because it is more comfortable that way but I have also used it on my bare skin with no complaints. I do not feel itchy or sweaty even in the Florida humidity. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because the size chart is way off. I ordered the small which should fit between 135-181 lbs and it only fits on the largest setting, if my belly gets any bigger it may start to get uncomfortable. I currently weigh 128 lbs and my (pregnant) waist circumference is 36"". Definitely recommend to order one size up just to be safe."
4,It works,"I got this belly cradle when I was about 5 months along, I really didn't use it much until I got to 8 months though. I am on my feet 8+ hours a day and when my belly started to get really heavy and started hurting my back I began using the cradle daily. It really does help support the weight of your belly and take some strain off of your lower back.My only complaint would be that it's a little uncomfortable to wear while sitting for long periods of time. Also, I will agree with the other reviewers that you should most definitely purchase the size larger than what they are recommending on the package. I am 5'1"" and weigh 160# at 9 months pregnant but if I would have purchased the small size (which by their standards would be my size) it would not have fit. I am now on the last set of loops on my medium and it fits perfectly."
3,Mini Cradle,"I'm 8 months pregnant and 135 lbs. I ordered the mini cradle size small because I am carrying very low and have a lot of pain in my pelvic area and lower back. I thought this might help give me some support, but unfortunately its too big. I use the very last setting to hook it on and it could definitely be tighter. I really couldn't tell much difference with it but I think it might be worth it if you get the right size."
4,Order a size up!,"Great product - but really order a size up... I am 5 feet tall with a current weight of 113 pounds at week 29, a relative small belly and ordered size ""Petite"". It fits with the largest setting so I hope the band will stretch out so I can still wear it the next 10 weeks... Maybe a size ""small"" would have been better for me, even if I am far away from 135 pounds!"
3,too big,"I ordered this belly band for the last couple of weeks of my pregnancy and I followed everyone's advice and got one size up from what I needed and it is too big. I'm 5'2"", weighing in at about 145 and I ordered a medium - on the smallest setting it's just not quite tight enough. I'm sending it back. I like the Belly Bra much much better anyway.BellyBra Women's Maternity Support Tank"
2,Hard and stiff.,I didn't find this belt to be that comfortable. It is very hard and stiff. Doesn't do as good as a job as the maternity belt I purchased from Babies R Us. Which has an upper and lower support band.
1,Disappointment,"A day after receiving my belly band I went to my prenatal visit and was instructed by my Dr NOT to use this product. It decreases blood flow to baby, for the same reason u can't sleep on your back. His exact words were, ""these things should be banned"" ... Sorry to be Debbie downer just think all mommies should know."
2,Doesn't do what I thought it would...,"I had high hopes that this belt would help with back discomfort, but it hasn't. I think these must be for very specific types of problems. I am only 32 weeks pregnant, so it may prove more useful later. My advice is to not have very high hopes about this helping significantly--it is not very expensive, so it may be worth a try for you."
1,not what I expected,"I opened up the small 3"" x 3"" box labelled ""Its you Babe Mini Cradle, Small, New"", and inside was a very nice roll of Scotch brand Magic Tape, 1/2 in by 450 in! They really should say in the description ""product pictured is waaay different then that being sold"". At least theres no sizing issues"
2,Not Again...,"Janet Jackson's third and last single from the ALL FOR YOU album is yet another mis-step. ""Son of a Gun"" samples the Carly Simon classic ""You're So Vain"", and also includes Carly Simon with some reworked lyrics. Overall its a poorly produced, badly sampled, jumbled mess. Definately one of the weaker songs from ALL FOR YOU. However the saving grace for fans may come in the form of the remixes, there are some decent ones here, including the Cottonbelly Vocal Remix, and the Rockwilder Mix. However, the remix featuring Missy Elliot is just pointless and jumbled as well. Sorry Janet, maybe next time."
3,Rock & Rolling,"This Light Modifier works great, I don't use it often as I normally use available light, but when I have used with with my speedlights, it's great ! NO complaints months later !!!"
5,"Westcott Apollo 28"" Light Modifier","The Westcott Apollo 28"" is one of the Best lighting modifiers I ever used.Highly Recommended"
1,Piece of garbage,Please do not buy this item. I am really surprised to see that there are actually some good reviews for this thing. It is so cheaply made and will not stay open. The little latch that is supposed to hold the umbrella open will not keep it open. Try using it on a shoot and you will be really embarrassed. I won't even attempt to re-sell this on Craigslist because I know whoever buys it will be disappointed. At first I thought maybe I got a bad one but then I had another photographer friend that bought one and she had the exact same problem. Suck it up and buy the Lastolite ezybox instead.
4,"Awesome to use, great light modifier...","The Apollo 28"" by Westcott is amazing, and adds great creative light possibilities. The umbrella design is great for easy and quick setup. As far as the reviews about breaking easily, I'd ignore those if you can use your brain and be careful. Any photographer knows that we hold and use expensive equipment that can break if we thrash it... It is not a delicate item, but if you drop it from 12' on a light stand it, like pretty much anything else under the sun will probably bust (that isn't a product defect that's common sense)."
5,Sportsman Ultra light Ultimate Edge Steel,Very compact and functional in the field. Wish this came with a finishing edge as well. I like to use both. Would do well in the field.
4,Good sharpener,"This thing does what it says. Very easy to sharpen any knife, but it will not get you a razor edge. No matter how I sharpen, and strop, I cannot get a razor edge, but it is very easy to get a nice strong edge that will glide through paper."
4,Good Cd,"I thought that this cd was good, and I recommend this cd if you are a R.E.M fan. It has many great hits on it and I know you will love it."
2,Dolls fell apart!,"After only a few days of playing with this toy, Cinderella fell apart. Then the prince fell apart. The mice, dog, and cat are nice and those are the only great part about it. The Fairy godmother has a creepy face and overall its just not a good product."
3,Good book,But very heavy. Had a hard time getting thru it. Possibly the style is just not for me but others should not hesitate to try it anyway.
4,By the end of this book you will feel like you are a cop,"This is a very true to life cop story. Far removed from TV shows like NYPD Blue and Law and Order, it shows the ugly side of police work, and how good cops begin to hate the people they are sworn to protect. But you will understand why without resenting the cops for it. Great book!"
4,A very good read but strung out in the end,"This is a very good writer with lot of experiences either in the street, the Job, or the Army. The whole texture of the story is bit random, mixed with lot of songs, flashbacks, monologues either with the blind dog or Hanson himself, ...and the author seemed to lose focus in the middle and the story became more and more far-fatched confusing with lot of small unimportant sex, drugs incidents, although it still could hold my patience and curiosity to hang on finishing it. Dana so far is the most desirable partner that any street cop could dream of. He died in the later stage of this book, but Anderson simply missed the chance to make this book a real touching one, he made Hanson a totally heartless s.o.b., albeit Dana's widow was even worse. A messy but very interesting book."
3,No plot,"It's okay, but nothing special. Michael Connelly hits very similar territory with more craft. Simply put, Connelly is more of a pro. The central notion, incidentally exactly the same as in Anderson's Vietnam novel, that everyone except the hero is stupid or corrupt, and it's just so PAINFUL for him to continue under such circumstances, is jejeune."
3,Gritty...Real...Boring,"Surely, this one does ""take you there,"" but...from what I remember [I read this about 7 years ago]...it was dull. Stick to Michael Connelly, who the LAPD itself, heralds as the only novelist who ""gets procedural right."""
2,"Overrated, full of devices.","This may have worked as a short story. But it sure went nowhere fast as a novel. I have nothing against turning the standard storytelling method on its head, but this seems to become too self-concious of its objective after awhile. It's one of those assemblages of barely related observations of the edgy lives these cops lead. I'm sure it is a hard life, but it does not necessarily mean good fiction. It's more like a mosaic documentary that is full of irony. If you're going to do it this way, do it well! I find that some of the more proceedural style books give more irony and ambiance to this life on the streets than these more intentional styles of books."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed by the slow pace of this book, and the vulgarity, while maybe realistic, was just too much to take. This book will NOT end up on my shelf. I'm afraid someone will see it there."
4,A true account of the Vietnam War!,"Leigh Wade's third book, ""Assault on Dak Pek"" is one that should be read by everyone, in fact, his other two books, ""Tan Phu"" and ""The Protected Will Never Know"" is a must for serious readers and historians of the Vietnam War. Wade's trilogy of his Vietnam experiences from 1963 to 1971 helped me to understand the United States role and involvement in Vietnam and the bravery and courage that our men had throughout this experience.Let us always bow our heads in silence and honor the men who so bravely serve our Country."
5,A very action fill book!!,"This book is a very good book with lots of action.there is at least 300 deaths and 20 battles.this has got to be one of the best books I have ever read.Leigh Wade has two other books out(Than Phu,and the Protected Will Never Know) whitch where just as good."
3,A 270 page book with 30 pages of combat,"Leigh Wade describes his final years in Vietnam. Nothing really interesting happens at all. Leigh just stumbles from bars to battlefields complaining all the time. Strangely enough, the most interesting part of the book is when Leigh comes back to the U.S. as an unemployed alcoholic with no one to turn to."
5,This CD is the same as Perlas Negras,"I felt like a fool when I received this CD, even though is an execellent recording but I already have it on another recording label and with another CD title."
3,compared to norway cod liver oil it seen to taste weaker.,"7 seas cod liver oil may have all the nutrients that they claim, but I look at it as cod liver lite oil.If they made the oil more pleasant to the taste and still retained its nutrition they have done a good job.but if the product is diluted to taste better and a decline in food value, then the product is lacking. Inthe future I will stick with the Norway cod. The 7 seas oil flows out of the bottle better than the Norwayoil. I feed the oil to my dog and she gives no complaints to either oil."
5,EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND VERY READABLE,"THIS BOOK BY GUTMANIS BASICALLY OUTLINES THE HOLISTIC KAHUNA PRACTICE BY INCORPORATING BODY, MIND, SPIRIT, AND NATURE WITH HEALING. IT IS VERY INSIGHTFUL AND REFERENCED WELL. IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE STUDYING HAWAIIAN MEDICINE OR MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. AN EXCELLENT WORK FOR ACADEMICS AND TOURISTS ALIKE. SIMPLY SUPERB."
5,Perfect gift!,A perfect gift for a collector. Gave this to a close friend of mine and he was very pleased with this set. Definitely a great addition to his collection of trading cards.
4,Helpful for acid reflux,This wedge was very helpful in reducing night-time coughing\gagging due to acid reflux. It took a while for me to get used to sleeping inclined but it absolutely helped. I'm glad that I got this one that was a bit higher since I don't thing the smaller wedges wouldhave had the same results. The pillow itself is sturdy and comfortable and the cover is good quality. Very happy with my purchase.
3,Conspiracy theory&#65533;again,"How does one control crime? By repressing it or by alleviating those factors that caused it in the first place? That may have been a loaded question but it is essentially what this book is trying to say.Vernon Tynan, the `Hoover-esque' director of the FBI believes that by bringing about a police state he can reduce crime, and he is willing to do anything to achieve that goal. Christopher Collins, the Attorney General and our protagonist finds out Tynans intentions to undermine the Bill of rights by passing the 37th amendment, and joins forces with his the opponents of the amendment to try to stop it from becoming law.The story is near identical to any other conspiracy story with cover-ups and secret documents, left wing opponents etc... Despite this however the book is still interesting and Wallace creates his characters and the setting with great skill.An interesting quick read."
5,Daringly honest.,"This is daringly honest story of marriage and divorce. Sensually written, it was joyful learning of Rebecca's discovery of fulfillment. Enthralling book."
4,"joyful, sad, and exciting","The Hidden Cameras could have come across as nothing more than a novelty act; but they are spared by the saving grace of having the gift to pen superbly beautiful songs! the stunning ""Boys Of Melody"" is my favorite song on here; it's delightful sound drifts and floats in a gentle way. it's one of those songs that makes you smile and gives you a little bit of a sad feeling at the same time. amazing how a well written melody has that affect on you sometimes. fans of The Flaming Lips should have something to rejoice about with this band, they both share the vision to write gorgeous and perfectly catchy pop songs with moments of errr...colourful lyrical imagery."
1,droll,"after reading all these rave reviews i had great expectations of The Hidden Cameras when i bought the cd in dec 03.how disappointed i was""catchy"", ""infectious"", ""melodic"" are certainly not words i would use to describe this off-key grab-bag of droll, repetitive, self-indulgent fluffnovelty act yes. this rubbish is aural mogadon.i strongly advise any prospective purchasers to get a whiff of ""the smell"" before opening your wallet."
5,Jolly Super Fun Time Music! Almost every song!!!!,"This is one of the best CD's this year in my view. Although I don't care much for ""Golden Streams"", the rest of the CD is a winner. I can't remember an album I liked to listen to all the way thru since The Shins or New Pornographers CD's came out.It is constantly in my CD player.I need to go see them live!"

4,"Roger Stern, the best Spidey writer","Just who was the Hob-goblin? This story answers those questions and a lot more. It marked Roger Stern's return to writing Spider-Man in almost a decade. He makes good use of the suporting cast here including Peter, Mary Jane, Joe Robertson, Flash Thomson, and Betty Brent. This story was so good, I wonder if Roger would write a novelization of it too!"
4,a poetic guide for children of Alzheimer's victims,"This memoir reads like a poetic guide for any child who has suffered through the dementia of a parent. Zeiger narrates her journey through several stages of grief from the time her mother enters a nursing home to her death. Initially, she torments herself with guilt for her inability to save her mother. But eventually, she begins to reconcile the image of the sick mother with the all powerful mother she knew as a child. Zeiger documents her mother's last words, and includes journal excerpts, poetry and lyrics throughout this profound narrative."
1,Did I miss reading several pages?,I thought this book sounded great but I am trying so hard to finish it. I have only read a couple of Fern Michael books but I am having such a hard time with this one. I couldn't believe the great reviews it has gotten. I am halfway thru and can't decide to quit or hope it gets better with each page. I believe I missed a few pages because I feel like I am missing something. I will keep going and hope I can give it a 5 when done!
5,Excellent read!!,I buy any book written by Fern Michaels as I know it will be a really great story. She never disappoints. She always manages to leave tears in my eyes and a smile in my heart as I finish her books. She is a teriffic story teller. I hope she never stops writing.
1,Waste of money and time,"After all the glowing reviews I purchased this book. What a waste of money! The story line was not bad, but this read like a first time author. Phil(E), Rick(E), Rox(E), Grac(E), Lain(E), it seemed like every characters name sounded the same. And, who in real life repeats the persons name they are talking to in each sentence? It seemed like just so much filler. I have enjoyed previous books by this author, but not again."
3,Confusing,This video is good for strength training but does not flow well.If you or your children are not used to circuit training it can be difficult. You watch a child perform the exercise then you are on your own. I did not like the way you have to keep going back to the menu to start the next circuit. You get used to it.
1,Still waiting,I ordered this book over three weeks ago and have still not received it yet. This will be the last time I order from this vendor.Hope the book still shows up.
2,Looks good but falls apart,"This product looks good, looks like it is quality but I wanted to get rid of it the day I installed it. The rubber insert that allows it to be ""universal"" is not durable and wore out as I was twisting it onto the shifter, so now the shifter wobbles around and is borderline unsafe because of how loose it is. I am searching for a higher quality replacement. This was soooo disappointing. My original shifter and boot were seperate and independant of eachother, this one is not. The knob screws onto the boot so you have to manipulate it so they will line up properly, pain to install. I would not buy it again or advise anyone else to."
3,A Failure in the Algorithm,"Rosie came up on the Amazon recommendations. Perhaps a failure in the algorithm or wishful thinking on the part of Amazon. As is often the case with Amazon suggestions, I don't much go for it. I do like Marti Brom and Patty Loveless, The Ditty Bops, and Patty Griffin, Dar Williams, and one or two Neko Case. And there's some Lucinda Williams that I enjoy fairly well. But not this. Unremarkable lyrics. Unremarkable voice. It has a high level of generic sincerity and important. I'd rather have either fun or gritty. Both if possible."
3,Good book for getting started in R/C Yachts,"This book covers all you need to know about Radio Controlled Yachts. What you need to get started, classes of yachts, materials, designs and setting up are all covered in this book."
1,The author needs to go back to journalism school,THe worst written book I have ever read. I would not waste my time with it.
1,Doyel is a hack and Duke sycophant,"This book is a waste of time and money unless you are a die hard dookie that doesn't care how much the truth is stretched, distorted or misrepresented so long as it makes Duke look good. The same goes for any other drivel that this hack writes for CBS. Based on who he trashes and who he worships, it is clear that he as a Duke/Coach K agenda. Basically, read what he writes and take the opposite as truth."
1,Interesting only because Duke Basketball is interesting,"What suprised me was the fact that the author got some of the facts wrong within the first chapter. Doyel later contradicted homself when he got them right in laterchapters. The only thing interesting is the content of the book, but that jumps around from one year to the next and back all in the same sentence. Doyle just spit everything out onto paper and did not worry about the flow of the book. Aweful, the only reason it is interesting is because it is Duke, and Doyle does not have anything to do with that, thank goodness!"
1,"Not worth the time to read it, or the money to buy it","Poorly written and without a shred of any real insight, this ""book"" has no real redeeming qualities. Doyel needs to stick to his online gig in the daily online tabloids if this is the best quality he can summon in prose form.Save your money."
1,Shoddy Work,I'm embarrassed to call this a book. It's nothing more than a glorified press release. No wonder Coach K had nothing to do with this 5th grade book report. Very bad.
2,"Pleasant reading, but far too superficial","I'm a Coach K fan and was disappointed that this book didn't provide more insight into hows & whys of the program and Duke basketball tactics. The history was interesting and you do get a feel for the Duke-UNC rivalry, but not an understanding of how the coach really thinks and what strategies he truly uses on and off the court."
1,Yawner,"I read the first 10 pages before I fell into a deep, deep sleep. This one is a yawner. Better used as toilet paper than reading material."
2,Kindle Edition - No Pictures,"The story is great, but I really missed the pictures. The Kindle edition only has the picture titles, but no photos (which should be easy to see on the Kindle 2)."
2,Don't buy the kindle version,"As an earlier reviewer noted, the story is great but lacking the photos. That is really too bad because part of the story is about the photographer. The worst part, though, is the formatting on the Kindle. It is a disaster. It is left justified, and badly at that. There is not any indentation for paragraphs and no separation between paragraphs. The result is that each page looks like a messy column of words. I found it very hard to read.Story = 4 starsKindle version = 0 stars"
4,"Very nice, but tricky construction","As some others have said, the furniture from this line is very nice, but a little tricky to put together. My husband assembled and said it was a bigger pain than getting something from Ikea, but we were both very happy with the end product. It is sturdy and looks lovely in our bathroom."
5,Very comfortable and pretty,I love these sheets! The 600 thread count makes it feel as though you are sleeping on a cloud. I would happily buy another set. The price for this level of quality was outstanding. You won't go wrong with these sheets. I highly recommend them!
2,Scratchy,"I ordered two sets. After the 2nd washing I noticed that the bottom sheets have developed ""fuzz"" balls - feels like your bed has crumbs in it.I know you aren't suppose to get this when you use 100% cotton - so possibly these are a blend (even though it states 100% cotton on the description).Disappointed."
1,600 thread? More like 220 grit sand paper,These are the most uncomfortable sheet I have ever experienced. A must NOT buy!
1,First Man - 60 minute video,Horrible experience... I want my money back.It doens't work.... It is NOT a norman DVD.It doesn't play on my mac computer OR a regularDVD player... I'm pissed!!!This is the second one II bought... same thing...I want to return it and I want one that works....
5,WOW WOW WOW,"I think Banda EVA is dynamite! She's right up there with Daniela Mercury, Netinho, Cheiro de Amor, etc. I love her Ao Vivo CD. All of her music is fantastic. Manda Ver, Pegue Ai. Beleza Rara - must of been a monster hit in Brasil. It's beautiful. All of her CD's are a MUST HAVE. She has a lot of fans in NYC and NJ. Hope she decides to come to the U.S.!"
2,Good up tempo music aimed at the teenage market,"The music itself is very upbeat with a rapid tempo however this CD is a live concert recording with thousands of screaming teenagers singing along with every song. If I was to hear her songs without the crowd I,m sure I,d listen to her more."
4,Great wine Cellar,"If your looking for a quiet, good looking wine cellar this item is for you! And a good price.Very happy and so is my wine!"
3,Form over Function,"I paid a lot more for this item than the price right now. I paid close to $400 and that was way too much. This is a fine looking unit but setting the temperatures for top and bottom of unit is annoyingly hard to set and it doesn't really keep white wine cold. However, it's an attractive unit and that counts for something."
4,"Great Product, Simple Design","I ordered this from Amazon as a gift. It arrived FedEx 3 business days after I placed my order, in great condition. The box was a little mangled but there were no problems with breakage or malfunctioning once I plugged it in.The temperature controls are easy to set, and although the temp does range approx 5 degrees between cycles of turning on/off, a variance this small will not affect how wine ages. Overall, a very good gift for someone who loves to store wine."
4,RocK & Roll Will Never Die,"The last time the name Sonny Burgess appeared in this space was as walk- on character in a review I did on the PBS documentary commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Sam Phillip's Memphis-based Sun Records. I placed him among the one hit wonders that fill up the music world for a moment and then .... Who can forget his sizzling ""Red-Headed Woman"" though. It still sounds good over 50 years later. In Sonny's case, moreover, it appears that he just kept right on being a good old boy rockabilly artist if this CD is any indication. I do not know that his playing has the passion of his youth but on several tracks he is `hot' in the old rockabilly style. Listen to ""Enough Of You"", ""Flattop Joint"" and ""Stuck Up"" if you want to know, or want to remember when men and women played that early rock & roll for keeps."
4,Another classic album of Hank Jones,"I am a great fan of Piano trio music and any Great Jazz Trio's album will not dissatisfies listners of this sort of music. I cannot say this one is a master piece but truly enjoyable and refreshing.After his brother's death (R.I.P. Elvin Jones), contrary to speculations that GJT would disband, the leader Hank Jones once again recorded a great stuff full of familar standards. The rhythm sections, Jack Dejohnette and John Patitucci, did just greatly. It is not a must-have but a good to have even for random jazz fans."
5,mind-bogglingly great,"This album was out of print for years. That it's available again should be cause for great rejoicing. It was one of the very best albums of the 90s. Not just one of the best punk albums - the best albums, period. This band has it all, great musicianship, clever lyrics, catchy melodies, and fierce full-on punk drive. On top of all that they have one of the very best punk singers ever in Frankie Stubbs. He carries a tune, while sounding as though he's pouring his guts out on every song. Sometimes it sounds as though he's running a genuine risk of spraying fragments of esophagus at the microphone. Get this if you have any taste for punk rock at all. Then get ""Horsebox"", the first full-length from the revived Leatherface. It's almost as good as ""Mush"" is."
2,usless,this is the worse cooler I have seen it was rusty and a large door gap letting in air.would not buy again
2,"Great topic, overly wordy","I found this book to be most interesting but terribly sad. However the writer's style became very tiresome. Poetic and repeated adjectives get old after a while, and the author seems to be trying to inpress his reader with his use of flowery and clever descriptions. I found it repetetive, and hard to read. I love history and have been a psychiatric professional for 35 years, so my interest level was high. The author should have included the diagnostic criteria for some of the diagnoses which were being used so often in those years, which bear little resemblance to todays criteria. A great accomplishment however."
4,Pretty good,"I have read many books on WWI, and this is one of the better ones. The maps are adequate, and there are many black and white photos, a good number of which I hadn't seen before. The book was easy to read and the writing carried me along. The book gave the best explanation for the failure of the Nivelle Offensive that I have ever encountered. Every front gets at least some mention in the book.In terms of negatives, the discussion of 1918 seemed a little rushed to me, almost as though the author was trying to meet a publication deadline, and unlike the rest of the book the sequence of events at times was a little hard to follow. In one of the few misprints, on p 175, Richthofen is credited with only 16 kills.All in all, a good introduction or a quick read for a buff."
5,Buy it here and save some dough!,"The Go Gos are definitely one of the greatest girl groups of their generation and the upbeat songs still stand up all these years later. There's even a certain musicality about their tracks that we didn't notice back then...was it because we were too young, or because we were too busy dancing around and blow drying our mullets!??Fun, fiesty music that will definitely move you...physically and/or nostalgically.Amazon offers a great price...I overpaid at Borders. ($11.99)"
3,A good little album,Nothing amazing but a good listen. Worth picking up and I'm sure if it's from your time period it's really great.
5,anthem of the 80's,"This CD is in my all-time top 10. This could definately be the anthem of the 80's, with lip stick pop to hard driving beats. It covered teen love to questions of life. I had my car broken into twice and each time my tape was stolen. I just ordered the CD."
5,BEST LP of 1981...,"Okay, after 28 years (???), BEAUTY AND THE BEAT remains one of my top 5 records of all time. Not a weak track in the bunch, and the GoGo's punky exuberance that was streamlined and smoothed out for radio shines on this brilliant debut. The single OUR LIPS ARE SEALED is perhaps one of the rock era's best introductory singles, and despite a brief career of 3 albums during their initial heyday, and a full length follow-up in 2001, this particular CD remains timeless, classic, and current. This one practically defined my 7th grade. A no-brainer if you dont own this one-- Its essential."
3,Love these ladies,"Funny I only heard of the GoGo's for the very first time in the late 90's, but instantly became a fan, love what they've done and where they've been from the 80's until now, still a great band."
3,Bring back Go-go's greatest!,"Today has not been one of my favorite days, especially since one of my favorite cassette tapes, Go-Go's Greatest, got chewed up by my cheap boom box today!Even worse, I've called just about every music store in town (Fresno, CA) and found out that the CD is lo longer available.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!! I'm desperate and don't want to have to shell out money for each of their seperate cd's.Somebody must beg the record company to reissue it!I gave stars for the songs I know and like. I'm sure the other's are great too, but their greatest is the one that I want."
5,All Hail the Go-Go's,"The Beauty and the Beat is thirty-five minutes and thirty-three seconds long and was released in July of 1981. Beauty and the Beat reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts (six weeks at #1) and went double Platinum. This was their first album they put out back in 1981. Only two of the songs managed to chart. I like all the songs on the CD like; This Town, Fading Fast and Lust to Love. If you grew up in the 1980's era, then add this to your collection. Beauty and the Beat get an AAA+++.Program 1Our Lips Are Sealed#20 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#15 U.S. Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks#10 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club PlayHow Much MoreToniteLust to LoveThis TownProgram 2We Got the Beat#2 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#7 U.S. Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks#35 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play#1 U.S. Billboard ARC Weekly Top 40 (two weeks at #1)Fading FastAutomaticYou Can't Walk in Your Sleep (If You Can't Sleep)Skidmarks on my HeartCan't Stop the World"
4,They Were The First,"Never before had an album written and played by an all-female rock band hit #1 on the charts. But the Go-Go's astounded the pop establishment and seized the moment in 1981 with this their debut album. For fledging American new-wavers desperate for some good clean tuneful fun, ""Beauty and the Beat"" was a godsend. Sly lyrics, radiant melodies and intoxicating rhythms more than made up for the relative musical inexperience of these five women. Though producer Richard Gottehrer may have muted their twangy and buzzy surf-guitars just a tad too much, the prominent drums and polished harmonies assured commercial appeal for this reformed L.A. punk band. With energy and moxy enough to yank listeners out of their chairs, ""Beauty and the Beat"" helped define the new sound of the early 80's while paving the way for other American acts -- male AND female. For a brief time the Go-Go's were, hands-down, the coolest. But they will ALWAYS be the first."
3,"Great record, BUT...The CD version is weird...","An excellent album by these beautiful ladies. But something seems to be wrong with this CD ""translation"". Mine seems to be sloppily done, and I don't know if the newer CD versions are better. The first song, ""Our lips are sealed"" is amazingly chopped at the very beginning!!! My other complaint has to do with ""We Got The Beat"", which is a different version from what we heard on the original album, it is like a shorter edited version. That is the only reason for my 3 stars, if I could rate the LP I would give it a 5 definitely.Anyway fortunately I have one of the 1981 LP's, so when I want to listen to this album properly, just play it like it should be heard. Notwithstanding these small things, the album is great, no question about it, these ladies were talented then and only get better with age."
5,"Their Absolute Best, None Others Need Apply!","""Beauty and the Beat....."" nostalgia for forty-something guys like me (who thrived on groups like Fear, Black Flag, and Iron Maiden, but secretly loved this album!), old-school sugar-pop for today's generation.This album is easily the best put out by the Go-Go's, so much that anything else they did (""Best Of"" collections included) comes a VERY distant second. From the first track to the last, this is an excellent CD.Plenty of the songs became prolific in the early 80s, and even the tunes that didn't hit are excellent. ""How Much More"" and ""Fading Fast"" are two of the greatest songs that are often overlooked from this album.Overall, GREAT album!"
5,Fun Cd To Cruise With,"The Go-Go's don't disappoint, especially on this Cd.I first heard this Cd when it was released and it does not lose it's appeal like so many of the 80's songs have.The whole Album is great, but it is worth buying just for the song ""This Town""."
1,"Not really yoga, and not really interesting","Hum...... Not really yoga and not really interesting. SMALL book, so not even cool for the living room table. Just sort of.. strange to look at. Giving this one away soon...."
2,for serious DTR fanatics only...,"and that's that...unless you are a drive thru records fanatic, don't waste your time or money on this dvd. It's overpriced, and very short. It has SOME of dtr's big names on things such as: live performances, intereviews, and videos. For the price, I was expecting so much more. But if you feel like without DTR you would die, go ahead and buy the thing...."
4,A good book for an intermediate econometrics course,"In the first year of my PhD, teachers recommended this book. I must admit that I don't appreciate too much the geometrical approach of several topics. Instead, I liked a lot the introduction given to unit root analysis and to simulation procedures. I think it's a more readable book than Greene's, and much more fun to work with. I conclude that this book is very useful for people beginning a PhD, but not for undergraduate people."
4,Nice Graduate Level Exposition,"As several other readers, I am not crazy about the geometric approach used in this book, although it is certainly very original. I love the the way the non-linear estimation is discussed. True, it is much better than Greene..."
3,Very Readable Book,"I recently bought a copy of this book and have read the first 5 chapters. This is not a bad book and quite easy going. I quite like the way it emphasize the M and P matrix in linear and non linear regression. But I found section 4.7 has been badly written. It tried to squeeze a lot of non elementary probalibilistic results in a few pages without giving appropriate explanations and examples. For examples, it briefly defines stationary and ergodic without further details. This book is written for economic students with only limited training in probability. I just don't know how those students will be able to understand. This is a very important section to the whole area of convergence and consistence. I hope the authors should keep this on mind for future edition."
2,not the best choice,Not a bad book per se; however the notation and explanations are a bit obscure and the text is not well structured. It looks like an almost unprocessed set of lecture notes. Green's and Amemiya's books are certainly preferrable to this one.
2,"A ""Pictorial"" Approach","This book was our recommended text for the first course in Econometrics under the Ph.D. programme in Economics. The authors took the pictorial geometric approach throughout the book. Now, geometry of this kind (pictures in two dimensions) may tell us why a result should be true, but it has serious limitations towards proving results rigorously. Even the important theorems are not well-stated, and often we have to search for the true result in a whole jungle of words. This book is very inappropriate for a graduate course; in fact, for any course, to tell the truth."
5,"All Who Speak, Need to Read","Being a christian or not, this book would help anyone have a pleasant, more productive life, better relationship's, etc. by learning how to control one's tongue and seeing how imperative one's speech influence's one's very own life, and those around them. A must read."
4,Entertaining Historical Nonfiction,"This is an entertaining and easy-to-read book on a fascinating case in Paris in 1944. Dr. Petiot, a former mayor and physician with almost Barnum & Bailey ringmaster overtones is put on trial for the murder of 27 people who were found, or should I say pieces of them were found, at one of his residences.The book, based on fact, covers the events and trial. The book is just the right length, not overstuffed with tedium and not so short you feel cheated of a real story. It's well-written and precise and strangely compelling.Was Dr. Petiot actually killing Nazis and french traitors as he claimed or was something else involved? It's a chilling episode within the context of one of the most important periods of our times."
4,capital scumbag or gestapo assasin?,"Everything I had read about Petiot before was compressed into a light sprinkling of pages that made it seem pretty cut and dry what an awful human being he was. This book, having the liberty to go into detail, delves into how the atrocities Petiot was convicted of could have possibly happened and his surprisingly plausible rationale for so many murders. I read this book eagerly, although at times it became confusing to me how these events transpired...but that's chaos in a post-wwII after the nazi occupation. I can't vouch for historical accuracy, but it was a very interesting read."
2,Blah,I forced myself to finish the book which is good because it doesn't become interesting until the trial at the end. Don't bother - not enough here to make it worth your time.
3,a different read,"Everyone lives a life that may be quite different from what might be anticipated. I would describe this book as solemn. Whether you like it or not, it stays with you"
1,"Boring, Plodding Misery","I loathed this book so much that I was compelled to come here and write a review. I'm on page 212 and I don't think I can bear to make it to the end (page 228). With every ponderous page, I feel more irritated at the stupid, foolish plight of the dull and lifeless characters. The author never lets us into the head of Lucy herself--who one would assume from the title might be the main character! In this book, people sit around doing basically nothing for 20-30 years. If this is supposed to be a sad paean to missed opportunity, it fails. Rather, I regret my own missed opportunity at buying a book with a semblance of drama. Some critics adored this piece of tripe; I can't fathom how it held their interest even for 228 pages."
1,just one star,"I am from Ireland - visiting the US for a year and read this book (or tried to) for a local bookclub. I have never read anything by William Trevor before and wasn't sure what to expect. I had recently seen ""The Big House"", a play by Lennox Robinson, at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin - a much more realistic depiction of the Anglo-Irish than Trevors.The plot was so implausable that it immediately lost my interest. His Prose style is annoying and ploddingly repetitive.As for this book being shortlisted for the Booker prize - It makes me wonder about how good a prizewinning book really is."
2,Boring and fatalistic,"I promised myself I would NOT read anymore Irish novels and I wish I had kept that promise. Trevor's fatalistic characters really make me angry. I can't accept that the parents in this book wouldn't try harder to find out what happened to their child, or that the lawyer helping the child wouldn't try harder to find the parents. And Lucy's so-called life!! Ugh!! Or as I would like to say to her, ""Get a life!"" What's with these Irish old maids? I don't get it.I read the entirel 227 pages, but I never really felt like picking the book up after about page 50. Soooo boring!"
2,"Magisterial beginning, weak middle, great ending","This novel starts and ends on a magisterial note. Too bad about that middle part. William Trevor's elegiac novel feels like a short story wearing a tractor tire inner tube. Let it be said - the beginning is a thing of rare beauty. To a lesser extent the end. Trevor is, I think, more highly regarded for his short stories than his novels, though I've never read one that knocked my socks off. This one could have, though, if only he hadn't inserted the needless 250 pages in the middle."
2,Fades away,"This book starts with a very interesting premise that could deliver an emotional and thought-provoking ride regarding quick decisions in life and their consequences. But it fails terribly as the plots narrows down to the life of self-pity that Lucy forces on herself because of her guilt. At some point, it turns from noble to ridiculous. It drags on and becomes terribly boring. I had a hard time reading through sections of the book. The characters and events seem to float on their own world and whenever they connect, the result is very superficial. This book lacks the depth of narrative and detail needed for the reader to fully relate to Lucy and sympathize with her guilt. It was very dissappointing."
2,Overrated,"I'm sorry, but I guess I just don't get it. Trevor's prodding prose is often beautiful, but the story is a little hard to follow. This is the stuff that legends are made of? And whatever happened to character development? I didn't really care for any the characters nor did I care what happened to them. And *that's* my standard for judging a book a good read. Can't really give it a thumbs-up."
2,Good enough but too bad,"This is the first of Mr Cox' books I've read, and I really can't see how he's got this far without improving his style. He is quite inventive, but his descriptions are awkward and often repetitive, and the liberal salting of references to ""Star Trek"" episodes read as if he had a fixed quota of them to insert.He does write Q well, and the book passes the basic test of making me want to read on....but I'll be gritting my teeth, and hoping for the best."
4,A Contemporary Master,"There is much good contemporary classical music being written these days and a good example is the work of composer Robert Kyr. His Violin Concerto Trilogy is delightful and worthy of your consideration. There are hints of Alan Hovhaness and Lou Harrison but the composer has his own voice. I can't decide which of the three I like best as they all have much to offer. There is some interesting percussion in the second concerto. With nothng to compare them to, I can't say if these are definitive performances but they seem committed. The productionn and sound quality are good and help make for a delightful CD. Kudos to small independent labels such as New Albion Records of San Francisco for making this music avaialble to us."
5,Timesong review,"Bill did an excellent job to capture the essence of losing a loved family member, yet seeing their spirit all around you after they leave this world. It has helped many of my friends deal with the transition of losing a father or mother. His words also helped me a great deal.This is a quick, must read story.Wayne"
2,Beautifully Written; But Could Have Used A Plot,"No one can fault the author's command of the English language; she writes beautifully.Unfortunately, like others, about half way through the book, I became anxious for a plot - which seemed to have disappeared along with the Rome the characters knew and loved."
4,In the Company of the Courtesan,"I had just read ""Birth of Venus"" by this author and decided to try a second one. That period of history in Italy interest me, and I think she does an outstanding job of weaving history and fiction into both novels."
3,Good Picture of the times,"I find this book a well-written account of a very talented courtesan and her devoted dwarf. The history seems well documented and detailed. The characters are colorfully painted but lack depth. The social background is also painted in detail. However, I find this book a slow, plodding read."
3,Okay Historical Lit,"While I generally really like historical fiction, the story seemed to meander in a strange way and didn't get really interesting until just the end. Still -- an interesting viewpoint into a courtesan's daily life and living in Venice."
3,"Great start, slow finish","I absolutely loved the first half of the book, I couldn't put it down. The irreverent humor of Bucino the dwarf as he told his tale of his and Fiammetta's escape from Rome, arrival in Venice and the reversal of their fortunes was very entertaining. Add to that the lush views of Venice and it's residents really made for fun reading. Then about half to two thirds of the way through the plot slowed down measurably, the big mystery fairly predictable leading to a somewhat trite and not too surprising finish.A very quick read, will do for a beach book or on a rainy weekend. I bought it fairly cheap at the big warehouse store, but I think I'd be a bit angry if I'd paid a higher price for it. If you must, get it from the library first, then if you love it buy it. 3.5 stars"
2,Mediocre at best.,"Typically, I love this genre of literature. However, I found this novel very difficult to finish. The story started out strong, but quickly grew very monotonous. I had a hard time connecting with the characters, and did not feel that a detailed enough picture was painted of 16th century Venice, which made everything seem kind of one-dimensional. This is certainly not the worst book I've ever read, but it definitely one of the more boring ones."
4,Good story but not gripping,"I loved the idea of this book: the setting in Venice, the courtesan's life, the dwarf; however, it just never became as real to me as I had hoped. At times it seemed to drag and seemed as if it could have used some editing. However, if you love historical fiction, give it a try."
2,I really wanted to love it...but didn't,"Great concept for a novel, but didn't live up to my expectations. SLOW and shallow, there were so many layers for the author to play with to make this a really rich tapestry of a novel, befitting Venice itself, but ultimately she falls short. For example bringing in Titian more would have been interesting, and making a portrait of her as a metaphor for Venice at that time. A snapshot of a moment in time. For a historical novel, she didn't really impress me much with her historical knowledge...I picked up my 'Palaces of Venice' by Peter Lauritzen and frankly found it more compelling. I would honestly skip this book given the opportunity again, but I was halfway through it, and just kept reading hoping to get a return on my time investment...In the end I really wanted to love it, but didn't."
4,Don't give up!,"The story follows courtesan Fiammetta from the ruins of Rome (and her fortune there) to her native Venice. The story is told from the point of view of Bucino, her dwarf bookkeeper/pimp/friend. The story at first was a little dry, and I wasn't really sure I could get into the book. I kept at it though, and eventually Bucino and Fiammetta and the mysterious healer La Draga seeped into me and I had to find out what would come next.My advice? Just keep reading. It gets better. I really adored the ending. I wound up having a very high opinion of this book"
3,"Not my favorite Dunant book, but still totally worth reading...","In comparison to The Birth of Venus and Sacred Hearts, I was a little disappointed in this one. Don't get me wrong, I would still encourage anyone who enjoyed Sarah Dunant's other writing to read this one but I was left a little less satisfied with this one as compared to the others. I felt like there were too many loosely tied together ends, that the ending was abrupt and that there were too many unanswered questions with regard to (and without spoiling it for anyone I won't name names) the secondary female character, the reasons behind her behavior and actions, the relationship with Bucino (who, by the way, I adored) and especially concerning the child. I feel like this book may have been rushed somehow and I know that this author could have done better with it. That being said, it is still a worthwhile read. I love Sarah Dunant and hope that she focuses more on writing historical fiction in the future."
1,*Yawn*,"After reading ""The Birth of Venus"" I was in awe of Sarah Dunant. So when ""In the Company of the Courtesan"" came out, I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately for me, this book is the very definition of ""dull."" The story is told by a dwarf who is the companion to a courtesan...yeah, ok. Reading about either character separately might have been interesting, but smashed together it was a mess.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"I second the ""Yuck"" reviewer ....",I had to stop at page 100. The characters are deplorable - as is the plot. I could care less if the down and out prostitute can rebuild her business. There was no one likable in this book. The Birth of Venus was so much better.
3,Disappointed,"Having read THE BIRTH OF VENUS, I was anxiously awaiting Dunant's new novel. With the fabulous reviews, I could hardly wait to receive this book from Amazon. Boy was I disappointed! The characters were superficial and not particularly interesting; I didn't really care what happened to them. I found the reading tedious and had to literally force myself to finish the book. I cannot fathom why this book is on the NY TImes bestseller list... perhaps it's just riding on the fame of its predecesor, THE BIRTH OF VENUS?"
2,Acceptable,"The beginning held my attention well enough, but about halfway through the book I gave up and skipped to the end. Excellent characters and interesting research, but Fiammetta and Bucino drown in a web of plot lines. More like a few episodes of a TV show than a movie."
2,Disappointing if you loved Birth of Venus,"None of the characters are very sympathetic or appealing in Dunant's latest book. I found the use of ""courtesan vernacular"" somewhat vulgar; which took away from, rather than adding to, the period feel of the book."
2,more of the same,"I must admit that I didn't finish this book. It was just more of the Birth of Venus formula..corrupt men, corrupt church and enough erotica to titillate.For all her research , these novels are pure fantasy."
2,Snooze Fest...,"I hate leaving books half read so I had to REALLY push mysef to finish this. I found myself trying to read as fast as I could just so I could finish. She gets points becuase it was well written, and she paints a pretty picture of the history and scenery of that time. The characters were boring, the plot was boring, which means I was bored. I think I would have felt differnt if the story were told from the Courtesan herself rather than her pimp dwarf?"
3,A Fun Read,"Not one of my favorites, but it's a good summer/beach read. The characters are engaing, but I expected a little more depth. I enjoyed the historical context, but the story left me looking for a bit more."
2,Barbie does Venice,"I heard Sarah Dunant interviewed on NPR, and I thought a book about a prostitute and a dwarf in 16th century Italy had to be interesting, so I chose to review this book for my book club before I read the book myself. I was disappointed. It was pretty much the standard story of the prettiest girl around, this time she's a pro, and the cast includes a few historical figures. I was able to rescue my presentation by researching the cosmetics, undergarments, fashions, and mortality rates of 16th century Italy, and wrote my own supplement to the rather lame story. Too bad the author didn't include these fascinating historical facts in her novel. They were much more interesting than the superficial story she told. (They brushed their teeth with crushed stone, their make up had lead in it, and they would paint blue ""veins"" over their white painted skin to appear more pale, for example.)"
2,"entertaining, but not nearly as good as Birth of Venus","An easy, enteraining read, but a weak plot and characters that lacked reality."
3,"Halfway through, gave it up!","Maybe it's not fair to review a book one has not completed, but I just could go no further. Got so tired of reading how beautiful she was, ugly he was, how weird the witch's eyes were. Really didn't care if she found a rich boyfriend or not. The descriptions of Venice and the canals were good."
3,Same author ~ different reaction,"I truly fell in love with author Sarah Dunant's writing style in her book, ""Birth of Venus"" but had a difficult time staying fully engaged with her ""In the Company of the Courtesan."" It started out capturing my interest with the very first line""..biting color into her lips when the unthinkable happened..."" as told by the courtesan's dwarf confidant, Bucino. Although, as another reviewer noted, the back and forth first, third person voice in the book was not always as easy to follow. I rated this a 3 star for the historical charm and Italian beauty the author created for us but would say to potential readers, the library is a good source to enjoy books that you might not want to invest in."
3,Slow Moving,"After an exciting start to the book, I had very high hopes. But unfortunately this book simply did not deliver beyond the first 100 pages. The plot was very slow moving and though I read through to the end in order to see what happened, I was in a hurry for it to be over. For me, it did not bring this period in history ""alive"". There is much better historical fiction out there."
5,Fascinating read,"A great novel. Different from the Birth of Venus and as such a very pleasant suprise! Characters are very well developed, the storyline is fascinating, the language used, at times crude, makes you feel like you are right there. The story is about loylty, struggle and survival, and so much more...."
3,Diluted Sexuality in the Company of the Courtesan?,"Dunant is a brilliant and poetic writer, which makes the book well worth the read. However, I agree with other reviewers that, for a book about sexuality and intrigue, it certainly lacks passion. While ""The Birth of Venus"" was provocative, this book was disappointingly tame. The most beautifully written passages of the book concern Bucino's thoughts and memories, and he also happens to be the only intriguing character. Fiammetta, who was supposedly so charming, certainly failed to impress. Only in the first chapter was she as mesmerizing as the author wanted her to be. The ending was rather anticlimactic, abrupt, and unsatisfying. These criticisms aside, the book was still entertaining, yet not quite as memorable as ""The Birth of Venus."""
2,A disappointment,"The book started out with much promise but Dunant could not sustain the momentum and halfway through the characters lose their appeal. Dunant's writing style is exquisite but a good book needs more than a way with words. It needs endearing characters and a captivating tale, and Dunant failed to deliver."
5,Beautifully Writted,This work is beautifully written and full of sensual detail. It has turned me into a Sarah Dunant fan.
5,BLOWN AWAY !!!,"I HAVE THE LUXURY OF SEEING MONTE WEEKLY IN AUSTIN AT THE SPOT OR SAXON PUB, BUT STILL EVERYTIME I SEE HIM IT FLOORS ME. THE ""FIRST & REPAIR"" CD IS GREAT AND A PERFECT ADDITION TO YOUR COLLECTION IF YOU LIKE THE COMBINATION OF MICHAEL HEDGES AND DAVE MATHEWS, BUT IF YOU GET THE CHANCE TO SEE HIM LIVE - DO NOT MISS IT!!! MONTE, ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS...""YOU DA MAN!!!"" AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE UPCOMING CD - ""MIRROR"""
5,PURE SATURATION FOR THE GUITAR FAN!!!!!,"I saw Monte on Austin City Limits and was floored with his talent!!! A guitar fan and player for over 20 years I love to watch this guy play!! He embodies the true spirit of a guitarist with his originality and smooth riffs. I easily added him to my personal list of favorites of Eric Clapton, Leo Lottke, Craig Chaquico, Stevie Ray Vaughn after seeing him for the first time. I like his music but even more I love to watch this guy play. He grabs and envelopes the audience when he does his solos....WOW!!!! He's purely a guitarist who loves what he does and does it well. I can't wait to see him live!!!"
5,an acoustic orgasm!,"when i caught the Austin City Limit's show with Monte Montgomery on it, there is no way to describe his art with typical cliche. The guy initiated my new term of ""an acoustic orgasm"". The excitement and pleasure the man contribute's to sight ,sound, feelings and curiosity are absolute in the musical sense. This dude need's major recognition NOW! If your'e looking for a progressive investment in satisfaction musicaly, this is it!"
5,He's the real deal,"I feel so lucky to have stumbled across this CD. I love every song and can't stop playing it. I am in awe listening to his guitar playing, not to mention the outstanding vocals. I play it for everyone I know. I can't believe he's not famous yet. He pours his heart into the lyrics and each song comes out shining. I would highly recommend this CD to music fans of any kind."
5,This guy is good!,"I discovered Monte a few months ago and am I glad I did! This guy is fantastic. He can write, sing, and boy, can he play a guitar. There's not a bad song on the CD. You won't regret purchasing this CD. Get it."
2,"Guitar playing is good, music itself is not appealing","When I saw Monte Montgomery playing his guitar on a television special, I was captivated. I just had to get his CD. Soooo, I hopped on to Amazon, read some reviews of his music, and bought this CD. Alas, the power of his guitar playing appeals to me more visually than audibly. I was disappointed in the songs on the album and, while I count myself a fan of his guitar playing, I can't say I count myself a fan of his music."
3,Love Story With an Engaging Subplot,"This love story is centered around two childhood sweethearts that fatefully come together again after a much tormented past. Talia returns to her home town to face her demons and is very fortunate to find much strength and love in Derrick. Derrick's character is very lovable and likable. However, I had much trouble getting to appreciate Talia, seeing her incessant and sometimes unbearable mood swings. But given her dark past, I can see why it was so difficult for her. Lynn Emery does better work in subsequent novels. However, I did find this novel to be somewhat engaging."
4,Interesting Story,"This book feels almost satirical in some places. It is told in very serious, no compromise prose. This is not a tongue in cheek introspection of what if's, it is a serious novel that just happens to be based on a completely ridiculous premise.If you're expecting comedy it's not really there. The story deals with parental relationships, destroyed careers, and succumbing to the most basic of human instincts.Overall it's a captivating story that will keep you interested throughout. The ending is odd and leaves a bit to be desired for me personally but definitely worth the purchase."
4,Irreverant and entertaining.,"James Morrow's story is startingly original. God is dead, and his lifeless and massive body has fallen into the Atlantic Ocean. Anthony Van Horne, a disgraced oil tanker captain, is recruited by the angel Raphael to tow His body to a final resting place in the Arctic. The ensuing Odyssean voyage challenges the crew's perceptions about God and morality. The result is a divine exploration of the theory that religion is the opiate of the masses.As original as the story is, it never quite rises to the grandeur of its themes, which isn't necessarily a criticism. This is a pleasant and entertaining reading experience, not a dour theocratic and philosophical analysis. Morrow seems to have sacrificed a degree of depth in exchange for loads of irony and dark comedy - not a bad trade."
5,"Damned, funny","James Morrow is going to Hell and I want to go with him. This book is profoundly sacreligeous and achingly funny at the same time. From the practical aspects of hauling a five-mile corpse to the eschatological implications of deophagia, Morrow keeps you thinking and laughing at the same time."
4,Courageously Sacrilegious,"A very powerful, insightful, and to some, sacreligious novel. If one has a strong personal faith, this book will hardly shake it. But for those who search, struggle, and doubt, Morrow is a reflective voice of signicance."
2,"Great idea, poor realization","It's a real pity that many good ideas in this book got such an inadequate treatment. Very innovative author. Imagine: God is dead, his corpse is about 2 miles long, afloat in the ocean, and Vatican is worried that it will get spoiled! Interesting characters are involved, including an intellectual Jesuit priest, a drunkard sailor, a nun, and many others. Interesting situations are conceived all the time. And yet none of that quite works: the bits and pieces don't fit together. The characters and the situations are not explored well, there is no inner logic to the book, and you never really get involved. Very disappointing."
3,Funny but self serving.,It has its funny moments but this is a rather silly story for the most part. This coming from someone with a strong and justified disdain for our religious brethren.
1,A poor man's Vonnegutt,"Yawn. I got bored with this book before I was off the first page. The premise sounded interesting, but there is a constant preachy undercurrent of self-rightiousness running through the book that makes it get old really, really fast. Besides, the book isn't even funny, just preachy. Do yourself a favor and re-read something by Vonnegutt if you want biting wit. It will be time better spent."
2,Not near as good as Bible Stories For Adults,A major disappointment for me. Long-winded but not particularly clever once it gets past the basic premise that God is dead. Bible Stories for Adults was a much better book. Much ado about nothing.
2,"Well-written humor, intriguing questions, but no answers","An excellent demonstration of how cynicism, once it has exhausted humor, leaves no basis for life. Even Nietzsche (somewhat mis-applied in the frontispiece) is lighter reading."
2,mistake,"Did not get what i thought I was getting. Could have misread, but believed I was purchasing the dvd movie."
5,Mancini...Always,"In the days of vinyl, whenever I saw a new Mancini album in the mall I bought it, knowing that I'd love it and play it again and again. Theme from Z and Other Film Music was one them and I am happy to be able to replace it in CD. From the hauntingly touching Molly Maguires theme, the stirring theme from Z, the playful Raindrops, through Patton, one never switches off the music because it has begun to wear...it is always refreshing, creating am ambiance of heightened optimism and awareness of the beauty of life. Henry Mancini will always be a gift to us all."
3,American Combat Planes,A good over view of American Military Aircraft from the earliest days to the beginnings of the jet era. Covering such a large field it is not possible to include comprehensive detail but for me it was an introduction to some types I had never heard of. An interesting and worthwhile addition to airplane libraries.
3,Not sure,"Book is different from the type of British mysteries I typically read. I found some parts to be a bit confusing (particularly the beginning) and a bit slow in places. Characters just aren't as developed as some other authors, but ok."
2,"Disappointing --careless typos, rushed ending","I usually enjoy Peter Lovesey's series with Peter Diamond, but my Kindle edition (at $9+) was filled with annoying typos which distracted from the flow. The story was OK --not up to usual standards, but all right, until the end. The last paragraphs reveal a slap-together out-of-the-blue ending which sort of washes over all that happened up till then. It seemed as if Lovesey got tired of the tale and put an end to it as quick as he could."
4,Not Really as good as the previous in the series.,"In some ways this book was excellent. The ""locked-room"" aspect of the book was very well done, and Peter Lovesey is an excellent author. I love Peter Diamond, but that's where I felt the book fell down a bit. I read these books because Peter Diamond is such a wonderful character, but I found that he wasn't as real in this one as in the previous three that I've read. He's still an accident-prone curmudgeon, but I didn't see the human side as much. Maybe that's because we didn't see much of his wonderful wife Stephanie . She is a wonderful foil to the irascability of Diamond. But the book is good nontheless. It's a page-turner and keeps you guessing until the end. We see the inevitable twisted mind as the perpetrator of these fantastic crimes."
4,My First Diamond,"I would have loved to give this book 5 stars. In fact if I had not read Peter Lovesey's previous work I would have!I found this mystery interesting, fun, light and entertaining but the main protagonist Peter Diamond did not interest me the way Cribb has done in Lovesey's previous novels.Nevertheless this was a completely enjoyable read: the ""locked room"" portion of the mystery was simple, interesting and ingenious. It was well-explained and not ponderous and verbose like some of the not-so-great mysteries of John Dickson Carr.I am off to see what my second Diamond will be like. I think it will be ""The Summons""."
3,Great logical mystery,"This book is a defense of mystery novels being not reality but logical puzzles for those who enjoy thinking. At that, it's a wonderful success. All the clues are on the table and it's up to the reader to decipher them. The text is fluid, although there's a bit much of it, and while characters are stiff their essential traits are behavioral and those are represented well. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy mysteries in the Christie/Hammett tradition of mind games and forays into discrete logic."
5,"Dion from Sagnasty, Michigan","I think this CD is good as hell. I bought it for $12 at Kmart and i listened to it for a few hours. i like just about all the songs. My favorites are, D.S.G.B, Sam Diss, Make em get that money right, Off in Dis Game, and a few more. Go cop it."
5,DSGB hit it hard,this cd is straight hard core p troy and dsgb held it down. with there hardcore gangsta style to slowin it down on some deep tracks like off in dis game and them devils tryin. anyone who likes good muzic. this is a must.
1,Damn Shame!!!,"man i used to like that boi Pastor Troy but this cd is a total waste of money. Honestly i dont see how a rapper could listen to the playback of this cd and be satisfied with the quality. Every song sounds basicly the same,and the ones that dont are just as lame. No one in the whole click can actually rap and that boi Troy is slowly but surely falling off. I do not suggest that you buy this cd.... IT IS GARBAGE!!!!"
3,Eh...,"The cover is best thing about this now dated attempt to locate design not just in the work of an elite world of artists and designers, but also in the ""vernacular""-that is, the everyday items that surround us. To that end, the book positions ""found"" items such as shipping boxes, torn up billboards, and scraps of paper next to commercial packaging, next to highly designed pieces. What happens is that next to same old overdesigned catalog spreads, arty CD packaging, and industry self-promo pieces, the found objects become a lot more interesting. Of course, I didn't need a book to tell me that, a simple walk down my litter-strewn and graffittied street does the trick just as well. The editors try and get all clever by not putting designer credits next to the pieces, instead printing them on removable stickers in the rear."
2,Dull and disappointing,"Having purchased and enjoyed the 2003 'Out on the porch' calendar I was really looking forward to relishing beautiful, scenic photographs showing interesting and serene views in this book of the same name. However, I was very disappointed to leaf through this book of black and white photos, with the focus most definitely on the house and position of the porch instead of the view from the porch. I expected the photos to be colour, like the calendars, and contain relevant, well written captions from classic American fiction. The book does contain some beautifully written snippets, but again, I prefer the excerpts in the calendar. Those in the book seem to be there solely because they make reference to a porch! I have received my 2004 calendar and have already leafed through it enjoying both pictures and prose. I wish this book met my expectations and mirrored the calendar beyond featuring a porch!"
2,Prenatal Cradle,"I tried this product in an effort to relieve the swelling of my veins due to pregnancy. Unfortunately I quickly sent it back.In theory this seems like a great idea and maybe it works for some people, but not for me. I know I tend to carry a little low and this supporter dug into my stomach just above my bikini line and hurt me. Everytime I sat down or bent over, it hurt! Maybe this would work better for women that carry higher.I only wore it for a little bit because it dug in, but I never really felt that it did anything to relieve the swelling in my veins. So for now, I just have to deal with being uncomfortable until I give birth."
4,It does what's suppose to,"I am quite happy with it. I thought it would be very uncomfortable to wear so I ordered a size up, and I am glad I did. I don't have a severe case of varicose veins, and wear it only when I have to stand or walk for long time. However, I do find the velcro to be quite rough and scratchy."
4,Great product - get 1 size bigger than you measure!,"This product is wonderful! I read a lot of reviews that said to order 1 size larger than you need. Pre-pregnancy, I was a size 6. I ordered a medium and it fits perfect."
4,Helps varicose veins in tough areas,"It's obvious why you might need this device. I won't lie, it isn't terribly comfortable after a 9-hr workday on my feet but it has helped allow me to continue working during pregnancy without having my condition worsen. Despite not being perfectly comfortable, I highly recommend this product."
5,Awesome,I wear this when I know I am going to be standing for a long period of time. It has made me able to do normal things again this pregnancy. I would defined go up a size. It is adjustable. A+
2,Couldn't find the right size.,"I had to return it twice, first I ordered size Small, it didn't work at all, it was way to small around my hips (about 40 inches now) I used wear size 6-8 before pregnancy... Sadly I had to pay restocking fee and shipping costs. Then size Medium sure feels ok around hips but it doesn't do the job - doesn't give you necessary support - no at all! I wish it had adjustable belt around the hips. I still need help with my vulvar varicosities, but this product certainly not for measurements. I'm 40 inches around hips, weight 150 pounds, in my 3-d trimester, wore size 6-8 before pregnancy."
5,Hot! Hot! Hot!,"Very nice album! I Like ""Screwy Music"" and ""Good Morning Judge"" (originaly from Wyonnie Harris)the most. ""Smack Dab In The Middle"" is another swing classic, ""Bad Boy"" is Rhythm 'n' Blues classic from the fifties of The Jive Bombers, ""Hot Hot Hot"" is remake of Arrow's carribean dance hit, ""Are You Lonely For Me Baby"" is a beautiful soul (hit for Al Green, Otis Redding, written by fabulous Bert Berns). And here it is a remake of his own song, beautiful ""Heart Of Gold"". Very enjoyable record!"
4,Just good fun,"Who would have thought that David J. From the ""New York Dolls"" would morph into ""Buster Poindexter ? No heavy messages here ! Just plain ""Good Fun""!!! It's nice to dance or just listen to music that isn't preaching about the end of the world. I give it a major thumbs up , just for being what it is- FUN !"
5,Buster Poindexter,Great Jazz/reggae/latin music. I am surprised i havent heard Buster before. Its too bad that his CD is out of print. Love it. Make some more music Buster!
4,Steve Von Till remains in the shadows....,"On ""As The Crow Flies"", Steve Von Till gets a chance to further explore the dark, minimalist melodies that were only beginning to be hinted at on his band Neurosis' ""Times of Grace"" album. Steve definitely steps out of the dark shadows that Neurosis casts with their music on this CD...however, he only steps right into a darker one. This CD is at once saddening, morose, and somber. However, it is so well written, and mood altering, you can't help but be drawn in. The delayed guitar effect on track three is heartbreaking, as is most of this album. If you are a Neurosis fan, you will most definitely enjoy this. I recommend with four out of five, which is a super high rating."
3,Refreshing but not as impressive as I thought it would be,"Although we should all be grateful to have WH Auden's thoughts on the Bard - and they are very novel observations - I can't help but feel slightly disappointed by this collection of lectures. It is amazing that his students took such diligent notes and that Arthur Kirsch managed to transcribe them so that we can almost feel Auden talking to us. However, I was forced to give it three stars because (and this is irrational) I just didn't feel like I connected with his ideas. His analysis of the characters is very modern and is definitely a new and refreshing perspective from what we all learned. His lecture on the Merchant of Venice, I thought, was the most interesting. However, I think that it was maybe a little too novel and provoking, a little too detached from the actual symbolism of the plays. I enjoyed this book, but I'm just not sure I have been convinced or particularly impressed with these lectures. Maybe it's just me..."
5,Rising From the Rails: The Story of the Pullman Porter,"What a fantastic documentary about the Pullman Porter - the subjects were so articulate, interesting and this was a thoroughly enjoyable and heart-touching documentary. The stories were just outstanding and I feel richer for knowing more about this chapter of American history. Highly recommend!"
2,Topical and Misleading.,"At the conclusion of the ""Rising From the Rails"" DVD, I came to the conclusion I had purchased an infomercial for the author's book. Dispite a couple of heart-felt testomonials, this production lacked any balance to aid the viewer's perception of the atrocious working conditions which were common place during the industrial revolution. No reference was made of the European immigrants that were mutilated or killed in the coal mines, foundries, and railyards which supported the railroads the porters rode upon. I would suspect the author misled many viewers that racial inequality in those times was exclusively towards African Americans, when infact it also existed for significant numbers of European imigrants. I expected the storyline to contain other personal experiences such as the train wreck victim experience, rather than percieved racial inequities of the period. Unfair and unbalanced production."
4,The talented Jive Jones,"I have heard a few songs written, performed and produced by Jive jones.He is a blast!I hope to hear more from this artist.We could use as much fun as possible in a jaded world."
3,What?!,"This is more an indictment of the seller (That Fish Place) than the product, the background itself is exactly what you'd expect and is fine if they'd not been so stupid.I ordered 4 feet of this 24"" tall background and what I received was 4 separate 30"" long pieces crushed up in a box that was about 5 times too large for the item. (background was bent and crushed to put in the box and then bounced around during shipping...)Amazon really needs to take a better look at vendors like this selling on their site..."
1,IDK,We thought this was a great product when we received it and put it on our tank. Now 3 months later...it is peeling off all over and has pockets of air bubbles in spots in the middle of it...how did it get in there?! It will not re-stick for some reason either. I guess we will have to take it off and toss it. What a waste!
2,"Misleading description, has a printed measurement strip on it","Specs say this product is 24"" wide... what they don't tell you is that 1"" of that is printed as a measurement strip (shows inches, cm, etc). So for someone like me who has a tank that's exactly 24"" wide, it's not a good solution. I'm going to get creative for the time being and eventually get a product that isn't misleading in its description."
5,This is great.,"Sure the sound has changed, but I'm someone that can appreciate that. This isn't for the stuck up ""DIY"" kids that think if a band gets popular they're selling out. Listen to this and just be honest with yourself, it's good music. I got this months ago and I havn't stopped listening. I feel sorry for you if you can't see how great this record is."
2,Keep searching for that clarity,"If you've never listened to Against Me!, please do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! It's not good. Reinventing Axl Rose was the best album of 2003, and As the Eternal Cowboy was a pretty good follow-up, but this album is crap.First Hot Water Music turns crappy, now this. What's happening in Gainesville?"
2,What a letdown.,"This was one of the most anticipated albums of 2005 and after listening to it with a clear and empty head I must say this album was a huge letdown. The band is experimenting with slower tempos and other instruments such as the horn section featured in the opening track ""Miami,"" but what appears to be missing is the passion, drive, and energy this band used to be able to capture in the studio. Some of the songs such as ""Pretty Girls,"" and ""Don't Loose Touch"" have that Against Me! feel, but the majority of the album just drags on, plus the whole ""betrayed by fans cuz they assume we've sold out"" topic is extremely prominent and gets old fast. If you're just getting into Against Me! I would recommend you check out ""Reinventing Axl Rose,"" and the ""Acoustic EP,"" both of which are masterpieces in my book."
2,You've got to be kidding - this album isn't any good,"But I'm giving it 2 stars for some of the music. What I can't stand is the lead vocal, who sounds like an awful imitation of James Hetfield. As I said, some of the music is ok but they need to get a new singer if they have any hopes of making real money. And what a dumb name for a band. Any references given them to The Clash should be considered heresy."
2,Terrible,"I bought this Cd upon request from a friend and it is terrible. I want my money back. The worst is the singers voice which makes you want to slam your head up AGAINST! the wall. His voice maintains the same scartchy, gargaly, high octave yelling no matter what the tempo of the song. Just Terrible"
2,It's Ok,"I love Against Me! but they'll never be a great band again, at least not for me. After you've accepted it, Searching For a Former Clarity is still better than everything else out there. This album is good but its about 65% slower than all of their older material and it kinda resinates with cliches. It sounds like Against Me!'s been listening to top 40 alternarock like the strokes and all of that mod crap. Sadly, the acoustic songs on Eternal Cowboy rock harder than all of the songs on this album. It doesn't sound like them. The closest this album comes to recapturing their sound is on the first track Miami. This album sounds like trendy mtv rockers in matching suits. Hopefully they didnt peak on their last album and will revive the sound that their fans liked them for in the future. Please, buy all of their old stuff before this. The lyrics are way too self indulgent."
2,Lackluster,"I dont hate the album. it just seems lazy. its not that bad but knowing they could easily do better is dissapointing. i know they took their time and stuck with ""fat"" but the CD sounds so much like they are going through the aingsty anarchist motions that it is far from relivent. Right now i think ""Pretty Girls"" is sick and has all the honesty the rest of the album lacks. better luck next time guys, i wish you the best but this is absolutely NOT on par with 'Reinventing Axl Rose'!"
2,Continuing Downhill,"This album is... mediocre at best. Against Me definetly climaxed with Reinventing Axle Rose (possibly the greatest album ever produced), and since then have been unable to put out a record that even comes close to comparing."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought this CD yesterday despite the negative reviews, and I'm glad I did. ""Pretty Girls"" is the only song on here I can't stand. The lyrics are cheesy. The kind of stuff you wouldn't want to be caught listening to. On the other hand, some of the best Against Me! songs are here...""Miami"", ""Unprotected Sex..."", ""How Low"", ""Problems"", ""Joy"", and ""Don't Lose Touch"".This CD is definitely NOT worth skipping OR writing off as crap."
3,Not so good vacuum,"This vacuum worked great...for the first two months that is. It began clogging up at the bottom and it is disgusting to clean. The filter gets very dusty as well and is another mess to clean. The suction is not very strong anymore, so it fails to pick up some things."
5,Must have for the cab drinker,Mikasa style - elegant and modern. Must have for fine wine drinkers. Nice size allows reds to breathe. Varied designs.
1,Unsatisfactory,"This is a full price item/Corelle Livingware 6 3/4 Bread and Butter Plate City Block pattern. The item sent was a second, imperfect. Seller did not respond."
3,Dated but effective,"With the many phrases related to collective farms, you can tell this book came from the Cold War era. Despite its rather drab appearance, the book is useful in giving the student a solid foundation for the language. There isn't alot of focus on vocabulary, but by the time you finish the book, you will feel comfortable with the difficult aspects of Russian grammar."
2,An outdated text,"I had this book for First Year Russian back about 10 years ago. It's probably not the best book for beginning Russian. It's somewhat old with no pictures, games, cultural information, or the other types of things you might find in a modern textbook. However, it did the trick and helped to propel me into what would eventually become my major in college."
5,My favorite tool for measuring!,"So far, this is the most favorite notion I have. It is clear with large black numbers so I can see clearly. I'm upwards of 50 and the eyes aren't as good as they once were. Terrific product!!!!!"
3,nice cover!,"I just have say that I like this cover and the other of this author as well. It's not like the ""usual"" ones and this is nice and a bit fun.And about the book, it's not too deep but easy to read and follow.A fun read if you want to relax and have a good time!"
4,Lighthearted Fun,"Just imagine the havoc a ghost can bring to a guy who is trying to remodel the house she has been living in for the past 100 years and you have an idea of the fun that's in store for you if you read this book. Cassandra is a VERY inventive ghost.But aside from Cassandra, 2 of my favorite characters are Rand's mother and Madame Ragnar who ride around in a Humm-vee and try to help Cassandra without Rand knowing.""You're the One"" is funny and (okay, here it comes!) ""spirited"" with a surprise or two at the end."
5,bringing the classics in touch with reality,"i read this book when i was very young, but i remember it as if it were yesterday. it was what started getting me hooked on the study of mythology.this book brought the distant and ancient classics to light and showed me the human side to these epic heroes. instead of the monster myths make medea out to be, i felt sympathy for her after reading this book.i highly recommed it to anyone of any age. if you can't find it through and out of print book search, find it at a library. i'm serious. you won't be disappointed."
4,Nice mixture,"I enjoyed hearing the different versions of this classic song by the Champs, but the original is still my favorite. Most of them were neat but I didn't like all of them - namely, the Transmutator mix was weird and sounded nothing like it. But overall it was enjoyable"
3,Buy 15 Copies....,...send them out to friends and family. This is the hip hop book to own. Extremely imformative. Good readin' from cover cover. Fevorish fun it is! It'll make you wanna start building your own rap list.
1,I got a bad one,"I agree, there is no headroom so birds will not come to it.It would be difficult to even fill it with seed. The product photo shows otherwise. Good Luck!I returned mine. Maybe at $5 I would keep just to try to heat it and reform the plastic, but at $14.75 it's going back. Again, maybe it was a bad one, but other reviewer also received one. I bought a good one locally for $5. two years ago at a Tractor Supply Store, but have not seen any in stock since. It is still in use and have many birds coming to visit."
3,Looks good...but birds don't like it,"This bird feeder that is attatched to my window, looks nice, and stays on very nicely, but the birds don't seem attracted to it. I put in seeds that many birds like, and especially the ones that are around my house (chickadees and goldfinches). However, none have even touched it after a month since I received it. It just may be too close to the house or to the people in it that makes them reluctant to use it. A good feeder, but the birds don't use it..."
2,"WINDOW BIRD FEEDER"".","THIS FEEDER IS EXTREMLY HARD TO POSISTION TO OUTSIDE OF YOUR WINDOW, UNLESS YOU ARE ON A LADDER. IT HAS 2 SEPERATE SUCTION CUPS WITH TINY WIRES THAT HAVE TO GO INTO TINY HOLES TO ATTATCH TO OUTSIDE OF WINDOW PANE. YOU SPILL MOST OF YOUR SEED TRYING TO GET IT SET UP, ON THE WINDOW. I LIKE TO RAISE MY WINDOW AND ATTATCH THE FEEDERS FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.. THIS 1 IS ALMOST BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THIS AND MY WINDOW IS AROUND 12 FEET OFF THE GROUND.. HENCE A LADDER, WHEN COLD AND RAINING. UHH NO. NO."
3,"Starts out good, but becomes tiresome","A chronicle of a female writer's descent into madness and subsequent self-discovery, it interweaves the various parts of her life - her early years in Africa, her Communist activities, a novel related to her experiences, and a personal journal, through a series of journals that she eventually interweaves into one. It's a bold and ambitious book, but after 500 pages or so, I was eager for it to end."
3,Too epic.,"Basically, the sexual liberation of women that became something of a Feminist Manifesto. I don't mind the bold content, it just bothers when they do it with with married men and have no sense of guilt about it. (Is this more a British thing?)This is a massive book and fairly challenging. Would primarily recommend to intellectual women interested in paramours.Some of the story and character threads seem to disappear, and the length is too damn epic."
1,Life is just too short...,"Life is too short to spend it reading this tedious stuff unless you enjoy self-conscious, talky books in which nothing much happens."
1,"Goes on and on and on, oh yeah, and on","This is a great book if you would like to listen to a crazy woman complain for about 600+ pages. So, if you're into that go right ahead. But if you would like to read something enjoyable, look at anohter book!"
4,original story,"Well, very well written, as it is a masterpiece but I didn't know Doris was so homophobic, it deceived me. Furthermore, it seems all the problems re caused by men's attitude, but aren't her women characters too obssessive?"
4,About time,"I got interested in the year I was born (1962) about a decade ago and searched out things that were of interest and note in that year and so I ran across and read this book.I found it lyrical, poetic and straightforward. Her view of the world through her notebook approach was intriguing and interesting. I was sort of shocked when i came on to see that amazon had originally written such a timid review.Im so thrilled that this book that I found and enjoyed simply because of hte year I was born in brought Doris Lessing the triumph she deserved. ON a side note, I was bemused by AMAZONS original editorial review of the book. Read it again knowing that she was just awarded the NOBEL PRIZE for literature."
2,Book Club Selection,My book club chose this book. Otherwise I don't think I would have made it through the entire 600 plus pages. The story was depressing and the main character seemed depressed and jumping into bed with whomever she happed to meet. The story jumped between people and the notebooks the author (main character) was keeping. Was not an enjoyable book.
2,Eh,"Like other reviewers, I found this book to be dull and way too drawn out. I didn't care for any of the characters and if I didn't have to read it for class I would have thrown it in the garbage a long time ago. This is one of those books that everyone talks about being the epitome of its specified genre but then when you read it, you're like why? It's over-hyped and you can find other books that are worth wasting you're time on this one."
1,Pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful :-0,I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. Maybe this is a piece of art. Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long.
1,the golden notebook,"I don't know why it took me so long to discover Doris Lessing. Her books are off-the-chart engrossing. Her description is so vivid that it puts one there, along with the rest whether it's in London or Africa. Her insight into human character and emotions is astonishing. I'm reading still another of her many books.Thank goodness we have writers like her somewhere on this planet. She has it all---adventure, political savvy, terrific understanding of what went wrong with the femminist movement....I recommend her as one of the outstanding writers of this century."
3,mixed,"The unique structure of the book in 4 notebooks was what attracted me as well as the fact that the subject matters looked interesting and complex. But after 400 pages the fragmented structure became more of an obstacle and distraction than refreshing, and I think this book would have been much better if it had been half of its length as I think there is too much repetition in the book. I agree with the author that this is not just about feminism, it is about the era of the 60's experienced by a woman with complex and active emotional, intellectual and political spirit. But I didn't find the protagonist, Anna Wulf personally relatable to me, and didn't feel that the golden notebook very intergrating either. In the end, my goal became just to finish the book which I did."
1,I just can't do it.,"I have tried to wade through this book. Really I have. I even referred back to the other glowing reviews, printed them out, and carried them around with the book, hoping their enthusiasm would infuse the pages and make me want to read them.Didn't happen. I am overwhelmed by the thought that if I turn the page, and all the characters suddenly die, I simply would not care. I've only gotten to page 300, though, so maybe the magic begins later. My only solace is that over half of the women in my book club feel the same dull torment.I'll try to tackle the book again in six months. If I change my mind, I'll post another review."
2,I just don't get it.,"I was assigned this book as a college freshman in 1973 for a English class entitled ""The Writer as Social Critic."" As an 18 year old male then I struggled with it. Now, as a 56 year old man culling my book shelves I thought, I should give it another try, and then donate it. However, I cheated and got the Audio version. I listened through the entire thing. I don't feel bad anymore for struggling with it back in 1973. Self absorbed navel gazing, as others mentioned, is exactly what this is. It REALLY drags towards the end. I could predict the actions of Anna and Saul (repeatedly) and found the whole process tedious. I am sure I could not have waded though this, just as other reviewers gave up, were it not the audio version. Yeef."
3,Worthy but wordy,"This was the first Doris Lessing book I read, and I read it when I was in college, but during one of the vacations. It wasn't required reading.I did not realize at the time that this was a seminal feminist book, and I have read I think two or three more by the author since. I found it interesting but very definitely wordy. While the heroine is full of good intentions she seemed to me to be really more focussed on herself than anybody else, and the long descriptions of her affair were tedious.In the end I felt that what she said could have been said far more concisely without losing any of its impact. Now Doris Lessing politics are not my politics and as she does tend to preach to the choir, there was a disconnect."
2,no es lo mejor,"no es el mejor libro. cuando lo compre vi dentro y pense k era mucho mas ilustrativo. el libro es hecho en papel suave sin cubierta dura, es mas bien un folleto y no es tan informativo como se visualiza."
2,Este libro es un panfleto,"Cuando llego el paquete, crei que no venia este libro junto con los demas, pues es muy pequeno, es una guia muy sencilla y creo que en los libros ""What to expect when you are expecting"" o ""Your pregnancy week by week"" que son para las futuras madres, hay una explicacion mas completa sobre el accionar de los futuros padres."
5,Lipcotes,It is easy to use and is effective in providing protection for my lips. I am very suseptable to pre cancerous items such as basel cells and to date it has protected my lips.
5,Good for people with sensitive skin,I have to be very careful with what I use because I have skin reactions to products with a multitude of ingredients. This is very basic with zinc oxide as the sunscreen. Glides on easily.
3,"Comprehensive, Well Organized, Poor Photos","This is much better organized than the other Roseville books, and very comprehensive. However, the quality of the photos is much worse since most are pictures of catalog photos. And many have incomplete model numbers in the pictures. Too bad!"
2,Buy a 2nd guide along with this for accurate info,"Somewhat better organized than the other Roseville books, however, the quality of the photos are horrible. Looks like they scanned low resolution images from a catalogs. A lot of incomplete model numbers in the pictures. If you buy this book you need to buy another Roseville book as a companion so that you can validate the information. I doubt the author is actually a collector."
4,I read it 50 years ago,"I was a ""slow starter"" in reading. My 6th grade teacher almost held me back a year because of it. In 1957, when I was 12, my father bought me this book during the summer, knowing I loved horses, hoping it would kindle my interest in reading. Much to his surprise, I read it in one sitting. Once started, I couldn't put it down. Without this book, it's doubtful I would have developed reading skills to catch up with my age group. Although it takes a few ""liberties"" with the truth and doesn't mention his being gelded (as you might expect in a childrens' book), I found it interesting and well written."
5,I can totally relate!!,This book hit home for me in more ways than one. For each and every issue myself or someone I know personally has experienced it. I totally loved it!!! Revenge is so sweet!
1,Amazon doesn't back up the products they sell,"I purchased 2 of these wine cellars and both failed. Amazon was kind enough to refund the full amount I paid for the first one but when the 2nd one failed beyond the ""30 Day"" return period, I was referred to the manufacturer. Lentek International was basically useless, they want to give me $199 in other merchandise, why you ask? They claim they do not carry the wine cellar any longer. What a surprise! Oh but do a search on Amazon, they still sell this Junk, so does Lentek it's in their catalog and on their web site. My only alternative is to buy merchandise with Lentek, so instead of a wine cellar I get a dozen Epilady hair removal products, 5 wine bottle openers, a Mosquito trap, all great alternatives to a wine cellar. This thing is JUNK, and Amazon is NOT a retailer to do business with."
1,Not a reliable product,I purchased 2 of these units for my daughters. One has been returned and the other is about to be returned. Out of the box they run constantly for days and eventually do not operate any longer.
1,Mine also died after 2 weeks.,"Great little wine fridge that worked great and was pretty quiet. However, the unit would never shut off (even after actively cooling for an entire day) then died after just two weeks. Forget about the warranty, I am returning this one for a refund."
2,"Well, it worked fine for the first 11 days...","The wine storage locker worked fine for the first 11 days until it just died. Even though it's still under warranty, it's going to be a major pain in the neck to re-package it & lug it to a shipping place (too large for post office) to return to the factory for warranty repair/replacement"
5,Life Begins With This Common Sense Approach,"If you have struggled with your weight and feel uninspired. This is the book to read. It's all about renewal. It help you help yourself. Come on America...you don't need a pill, use this approach and begin your life. Live healthy and prosper."
5,wonderful!,"i highly enjoyed reading this book! the characters were well thought out and you felt as if you knew each one like a neighbor. the book takes a different approach to history. all of the events have actually happened, but alfred himself is a creation. you felt sad when he hurt and happy when he rejoiced. there were a couple of slow points in the book, but if you push past them, you will find the overall finish totally rewarding!"
5,EXCELLENT AND PRACTICAL BOOK!,"I have 3 children, 22, 20 and 11 and I had always wanted to make sure they will be ok, in all areas, after I pass away. This book has opened my eyes to so many things!! It gives great advice, websites to look at, and overall very practical suggestions that I will immediately put into practice. I thought maybe it was too late (at least for my 22 and 20 year olds, but I have confirmed that one main key is to stop procrastinating and start right away!). I think this book should be a 'must' for everyone that plans to become a parent..., and also for the ones that have not done anything yet to secure the financial future of their child!"
5,McKinley Does a Great Job...,"This was a great read. Like Kevin, I am a practicing Certified Financial Planner. In 15 plus years of practice, I have read tons of book and articles on amassing wealth, etc. Most are a lot of fluff and ""the same old thing."" It is not the public schools responsibility to teach our children about money. As loving parents, it is ours! Tomorrow is my oldest daughters 14th birthday and she is opening her Roth IRA. Kevin builds a strong case for using money as a tool to give our children much more flexibility as they face life's challenging decisions. Imagine how different your life could have been without having to pay back student loans and/or knowing that your retirement years were well on their way of being secured when you were only in your early 20s. Kevin, thanks for a job well-done!"
1,If her name weren't Higgins Clark....,"...would she ever have gotten published? I rather doubt it. I have never been impressed with her writing, and her grasp of grammar is tenuous at best, but some of her books have been at least entertaining. Not so in this case--I'm having trouble getting through this slender volume. The story is simplistic, the characters superficial. The author gives us glimpses into her supposedly bright heroine's thoughts, but she seldom does more than state the obvious.There is something that has been bothering me about this series, but I haven't been able to put my finger on it until this, latest entry. The setting is supposed to be contemporary, the heroine youngish. Yet, the feeling and tone is not comtemporary, and the language and syntax of the thirty-something characters is much older. I'm not saying I want to hear a lot of bad language--I don't, but the lack of timeliness is jarring to say the least."
1,Popped,"Having received this book in a package of three from my book club, and being too lazy to send it back, I read it. I've not read any of Ms. Clark's books, and if this is an example of her work, I will not read her again. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the excellent writers I am in the habit of chosing to read, but if this lady can get publised, then my dog, Bob, has an excellent chance. The characters are cartoonish and one- dimensional, the setting and plot are ridiculous, and the writing juvenille. I've read better dialogue in children's books. I slogged through it, however, mainly so I could know what I was talking about when writing this review. And in the words of Bart Simpson, it was ""craptacular"". Next time, I'll make that trip to the post office before I ever read anything else by this woman."
5,Great,This book arrived in plenty of time for Christmas so I could add it to other books in the series I was looking for
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"This audiobook wasn't able to hold my attention. It was read well by the person doing the audio, but the story wasn't able to pull me in. After the first disc, I somehow ended up with the last disc and didn't realize until I was on track four. I took my ability to essentially skip the whole middle part of the book without noticing as a sign that I should just turn it off and move onto something else."
4,Popped,"I enjoyed this book. Kept my interest better than Fleeced. Premise was a little odd, but it is a fluff mystery."
4,Popped,"Since I was reading all of Reagan Riley's books in order, I was not disappointed with Popped. Each time I read another book, I am amazed at where the theme is for the crime to be committed. It was a good ending with Jack doing his propsal to Reagan in a hot air balloon. If you are a fan I recommend the book as it is fast moving story line with some odd characters in the book. HM"
1,Very Dumb,This book was so dumb that I do not care to read any more books by this author. A total waste of time!
1,Stay Away,This is my first experience with the Regan Reilly series & I don't intend to read any more. I found it in an airport & have decided it was actually someone's cruel joke. Stick with her mother's books!
1,Awful,"I have read all her other books, but I just am not able to finish this one. Every other chapter brings a new suspect. The characters are not likeable or well developed. And, as another person wrote, I don't care who did it. Boring and dumb."
1,Ugh,"I picked up this book at a bookstore because I needed a book to read on a 6 hour flight and had already read all the Mary Higgins Clark novels available. Hoping that writing talent was genetic, I picked up this book. Quite frankly, it made me want to jump out of the plane. MARY HIGGINS CLARK FANS: do NOT assume that just because CHC is the daughter of a brilliant writer that she is a brilliant writer herself, because her books are shallow and awful. Terrible plot, terrible storytelling, and the ""mystery"" isn't mysterious at ALL."
1,Poo poo,"Since I'm not allowed to say the S word on here I'll just use poo poo.As another reviewer on Amazon stated, possibly the worst fiction I've ever read. How does this author keep getting published?What? Her mother's name is Mary Higgins Clark. Okay, never mind. I understand now."
1,I agree with the previous reviews - this deserves a 0 star!,I guess I was expecting something on line with Carol Higgins Clark type mysteries - forget that - not even close!! The characters are ridiculous and the storyline - well I am not sure you can even call it a storyline - is simplistic and just dumb! Don't even think about this one. Read a magazine!
3,Way to go mum!!,"When Brooke finds out that the new pop singer that is taking the world by storm,Coco,is actually her MOTHER whom she hasn't seen for donkey ages,she's naturally excited.But her life becomes very horrible when she is forced to keep the truth from her peers as Coco's [...] agent believes motherhood will tarnish Coco's image."
1,A Balanced Viewpoint,"The comments in this product review are completely uni-lateral and subjective in the extreme. While racism of any stripe can never to be condoned, it is a fact of life that the ""dehumanization"" and ""demonization"" of the ""enemy"" -- (i.e., Taliban, Mujahadeen, Iraqi Army, Iranian Regime, Viet Cong, Nazis, etc.) is part of all warfare waged by the U.S. and their allies. You should first consider the source and use your own historical perspective. Save the ""sermonizing"" and ""politically correct"" speechifying for those people who really are so weak-willed or numb-skulled to buy this DVD for purposes of reification and reiteration. In deference to those who suffered mightily at the hands of the less than compassionate Imperial Military Forces of Japan, give me a break! Save the ""marking"" and ""tagging"" for ""Birth of a Nation"", ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", or ""Gone with the Wind""."
1,Rip-off,"Susteen advertises that you can upload, download and manage your cellphone contacts with this easy to use software. The software is easy to use -after you get through the installation and update maze however this product DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED. After spending the money, waiting for the product and a seemingly endless series of installation/update steps, it only picked up about half of my total contacts list. When I went to the website looking for help the answer I got was equivelant to 'Oh, well. That's just the limits of the software'Needless to say, I will not be buying any more product from Susteen"
1,Wireless camera did not work,"I purchased this camera because of its supposed wireless capabilities. The camera worked okay when the RJ45 Ethernet wire was connected to the camera, but when I disconnected the wire and tried to use the camera wirelessly, it never worked. I corresponded with tech support at Axis for two weeks. After about 12 emails back and forth attempting to get the thing to work, I gave up and returned the camera.All of my wireless computers worked perfectly. My Tivo wireless adapter worked. My iPhone works wirelessly. I have six wireless devices connected to my home LAN, and they all work perfectly. Not so for this Axis wireless camera.If you are looking for a wireless camera that works, look somewhere else. This one doesn't work."
4,DVD Philadelphia,"I am very happy to inform you of my expereience with Amazon.comhas been very good. All items that I have ordered have been shipped to me so quicky. I like the e-mails that have been sent to me, when my order was processed and when I can expect the arrival of it."
1,Philadelphia DVD,"Sad, I bought it as a gift and it turned out to be a European version which would not work on their North American DVD player."
1,Too sentimental and politically overstrained,"Federal law, in one of its numerous unfunded mandates, in effect orders enterprises large and small to keep ill people in their employ and thus pay for their medical bills. That's the law, so be it. It could make for an interesting courtroom drama as a top legal firm defends itself against violating this law when it dismissed an attorney who concealed his AIDS infection. But what the movie does is politicize the case by using it to denounce the US as homophobic, racist, and oligarchic, plus sentimentalize a homosexual who did not protect himself against AIDS. I see the resulting movie as a cheap exploitation of the subject, with theatrics in the courthouse and lots of schmalz elsewhere."
5,Good Movie,I wanted to watch this movie due to a project on my health class. I thought it gonna be a boring movie but i was surprise becaus It is an awasome movie.
5,Philadelphia,"Another GREAT MOVIE, a roller coaster of feelings. The ebb and flow is tragic yet Love rise's to the surface. Washington and Hanks are two of my favs. Almost Every movie is worthy of whiching. LOVE IT"
5,Very touching and powerful movie!,"The story line makes you feel so much for the guy getting beat down by society, but it makes you feel so good inside when justice is finally served in the end. Very powerful, very poignant movie."
5,One of the best movies ever made.,"Tom Hanks really deserved that oscar, Im so glad he won it. He is one of my favorite actors. the way he portrayed his character in this movie was superb. If you like a good cry, or even if you dont, I suggest you see it. I have never cried during a movie, but I was very close to crying the first time I saw this movie. That has only ever happened once before. (While at the movies watching ""Jack"" with Robin Williams in it.)Now I normally dont like sad movies, but Philadelphia is an exeption. Ive added it to my list of movies I absolutly love and watch over and over again. (Some other movies in my list include: Interview With The Vampire[my favorite], Austin Powers, The Object Of My Affection, The Birdcage and Twister.) As I said before- Philadelphia is one of the greatest movies ever made."
3,Great performances but a little too controversial,I think Hollywood went a little off the deep end with this film. It's a good movie but it preaches way too much. My views are very conservative and I just found the subject matter to be a little too off color. But on screen you will see Hanks and Washington give excellent performances. I pondered at the end of the film who gave the best performance. And no matter what your views are you can't deny Tom Hanks the oscar for this film.
4,Great Film,"This is a great film! I can't believe that it has been almost 20 years since it was made. It is almost an era-piece now. There are no car crashes nor shooting of guns. So, if you are into to that mindlessness, stay away. My only complaint is with Amazon's service. The film was stopped 5 times for rebuffering. I don't get that with Netflix or Vudu."
5,Powerful.,"Performances well done, as usual, by a couple of my favorite actors. Makes you think. Allows you to look at another aspect of life. The movie is dated, but the theme isn't."
3,No day in the park,"This is one of those topic movies that needs to be made to articulate an issue, but my God is it depressing. I don't even like to remember the sad scenes that make up the movie; Tom Hanks struggling to fit in while his coworkers first shun and then fire him is enough to bum anyone out. The powerful performances enhance this gloominess, and there is no heartstring left unplayed by the filmmakers. I feel guilty about giving this such a mediocre rating, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't need to be taught a lesson about discrimination against HIV positive people."
3,Not a DVD. Got a VHS,This is one of my fiance's favorite movies and I wanted to get the DVD for him for his birthday. I received a VHS tape and not a DVD though and his birthday is in five days. Not pleased. Make sure you get this movie in the right format because it's incorrect here online.
4,Pleased with product / seller,"Product arrived as described in Amazon listing. Played flawlessly in my (old) DVD player. Movie was as moving / powerful as I first remembered it many years ago ... ironically, the content is still relevant in the 21st century! Seller packaged everything well ... no damage to product. My only disappointment was the product did not have a paper insert with artwork / pictures ... however, at this price point, I can't really argue. Would recommend buying this product from this seller."
2,denzel could have been nominated for the big one,philadelphia was a good movie don't get me wrong but it dragged in certain parts 4 me like when denzel played joe and tom played andrew going over the case at andrew's apt he wasn't focused he was more focused on the opera song playing which was too long for a scene for me to understand other that that they movie was rather for very good denzel helped me enjoyed the film because he played his role well as the lawyer who wasn't prejude against homos and people with aids
3,"No, No, No","Firstly, this is NOT an AIDS film. It's not a gay film. It is first and foremost a courtroom drama. That it uses AIDS as it's raison d'etre is irrelevant. If you replaced AIDS with anything from sexual discrimination, to race or religion it would be pretty much the same film. I don't think Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas actually touch in the film-even when they're lying in bed together. But it still is interesting for what it is."
1,boring,gave it 20 minutes but it didn't get anywhere - the music kept saying something big is coming but the same mundane tone continued on and on and on. No thanks.
3,"NICE SHOTS OF THE CITY,FINE SONG","There is nothing worse for a movie buff to watch a movie that's trying too hard to make its point.Such is the case here, even if DENZEL and TOM make it tolerable to watch because they are fine actors.I enjoyed the shots of the city at the beginning and at the end because having spend a week there i am very fond of the city.BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN who was born in NEW JERSEY was a good choice to write the title song.Wait for a late night screening on tv."
2,a slow moving bore,this film supposedly is an outcry against homophobia? It is merely a two hour bore which not only does not deliver the message but drags along at a snails pace. The story is dull and denzel washington is wasted here. Tom Hanks is always cast in dull movies anyway. If you want an efd exciting film on this theme try Victim with dirk bogart
3,Okay I guess,"I tried to use this movie for a court class I teach but it was not so much about the court process as it was about the actual life and story of Andrew Beckett. Yes, it was a good storyline but if you are expecting a lot of courtroom scenes you will be disappointed."
5,Love this movie,I have all of tom hanks movies on dvd and i have to say that this one is one of my top 3 favorites.
2,My review,"Not as good as I expected it to be. If it weren't almost as much $$ to send back than the CD costs, I would return it."
4,"Dream, dream, dream...","If you like bossa nova, jazz, Brazilian music, easy listening (e.g. Diana Krall), or need to get set for a romantic mood, you will surely appreciate this essential album Dreamer (2004) by So Paulo-born pianist and singer Eliane Elias.Dreamer, the English translation of Tom Jobim's Vivo Sonhando, holds a fine collection of romantic songs and arrangements, and pays a tribute to Brazilian music in featuring Brazilian songs, made accessible through their English lyrics: Photograph (Fotografia), So Nice (Samba do Vero), of course Dreamer (Vivo Sonhando), and the lovely Doralice (sung in Portuguese)."
4,Soft and Sultry,"Elaine Elias, jazz pianist and singer gives a marvelous performance on this CD. Several offerings smolder with sensuality. Enjoy this with someone special."
5,Great CLEP Prep Book!,"I just took both micro and macro economic CLEP tests, and passed both with a 63 and 60 respectively. The only studying I used was this book, coupled with a little online research and the offical CLEP practice tests. It worked great! However, this book does not cover the exchange market, so I suggest that you research this a little before taking the test."
5,Best for CLEP TEST preparation,"I used this book and CLEP official guide for microeconomics CLEP test, and passed with 92nd percentile. Highly recommended for those taking CLEP."
3,ok,"It really didn't give me any use for the class I thought it would help with. It is a good book of information, Paid it forward to a student at work"
1,RIP OFF,"IF YOU LIKE HOME MOVIES YOU MAY LIKE THIS, NO NEED TO BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE THE ENDLESS SUMMER, I SUGGEST WAITING FOR ENDLESS SUMMER 2 ON DVD."
3,end summer revisit,"or 2.5 stars. short film. not enough new clips about either es1 or es2. only thing new: people interviews, home vid shots & few new xtra clips from the 2 former films and spec. features of people related bios. get it for cheap or not @ all. es1 n es2 are good/different-e.s. 2-the best."
2,"Good Charlotte - ""songbook""",This a Songbook with the musical notes and lyrics! I bought this book thinking it was a book to read about the band and was disappointed- Just hope this review helps other's!
2,below average songs by a below average band,"it has the ultimate sell out song ""anthem"" and most of the other songs are boring to play but i gave it 2 stars cause their first cd was awesome"
4,A long cry from just vitamin C.,"Years ago it was Linus Pauling of Caltech touting the benefits of Vitamin C. Then others added the benefits of vitamin A, but be careful because one could go toxic with too much of the oil-based form. Then others came up with a plant-based form. Now, we are completely accepting of these and Passwater and Davis are bringing us into the millenium with an explanation of a whole new realm of antioxidants - their benefits, their necessity, etc. This is a good book for the beginners who want to learn more about how they can do more for themselves."
1,"Interesting, though outdated theories.","The black and white photo plates showing stereotypical faces and bodies of various populations of people are really captivating. However, the analysis and the ""scientific"" theories about race in the book are quite outdated, like all of Coon's writings..."
4,Good Movie!,"This movie is about a mob boss that sends his step son to australia to deliver a large amount of cash to a hitman. When they get to australia they hit a kangaroo with their truck. They get out and place their jacket on the kangaroo. The jacket holds the money, but the kangaroo wakes up and takes off. The rest youll have to watch. I enjoyed this movie. Its more comical, not bloody or violent. My kids like this movie."
3,A FEW KICKS HERE AND THERE,"I'm sure that CSI producer Jerry Bruckheimer doesn't hold this somewhat lame movie close to his heart, but it's really not all that bad. KANGAROO JACK, the titular hero, is NOT a talking kangaroo, but the CGI generated marsupial does provide a few laughs. Jerry O'Connell stars as the stepson of gangster Christopher Walken in an atypically ineffective performance> He and his buddy (the annoying Anthony Anderson) find themselves off on a courier mission with $50,000 to Australia. Once there, however, they lose the money when Anderson puts his jacket with the money in it on the kangaroo, who they thought was dead. Aha, he's not and the roo makes off with the dough and Walken sends his own son to take care of things. Along the way, they meet the lovely Estella Warren and start off on their journey on farting camels.Yes, it's a silly movie, but a good time passer if you don't have anything else to watch."
3,Not bad,"Kangaroo Jack is a pretty good movie. Not one that you want to buy really, but one that's nice to rent on occasion.Jerry O'Connel plays Charlie, aboy who grew up with a step-father who never really loved him. Anthony Anderson plays Louis, a lovable jelly-bellied black man who constantly gets Charlie into scrapes. And Estella Warren plays Jessie, and attractive guide who helps them find their money.KJ has a very sensual scene in the desert which did not have to be there. To me, it detracts from the goodness of the movie. There is one hilarious scene in which Louis, overweight and blubbery, farts really loud and long. But there are other funny moments too.KJ is a good movie, but gives off the feeling that you can't even make a family movie without sensuality in it."
4,A tad racy for PG rating,"While hysterically funny, I felt there were more than a few references to breast humor and sex than need be rendered in a PG rated film. The innuendos take a childs mind racing in the wrong direction and away from the clever story at hand. The enhanced Kangaroo graphics were fair to good. The two main actors catered well to adults and youngins alike in a comedic sense through excellent facial expressions, tone, and body language. An exciting ending for the ""good guys"". All in all, it moved quickly and concisely."
2,A Talking Kangaroo?,"This movie wasn't my favorite. Some people might like it . Its well acted (in my opinion) the story line is kind of silly but there are some humorous stuff in here. If you have nothing to watch, go ahead and watch it. Its fun, its cute. Its OK. I've seen worse. Its not completely bad, but go watch it and find out for yourself."
3,Hippity-Hop Fun,I love Kangaroo Jack. While I saw funnier films but the pair of Jerry Connell&Anthony Anderson was a good job. Plot was very good with fun twists and turns. I don't understood the complaint of the viewers when they say that scenes were lewd and violent. What movie was they watching just because of the appearance of mobsters. This was a fun movie.
5,beter quality than described,"I ordered this movie for my 4 yr old son. He had broke a previous DVD and this was his most favorite movie to watch. It was listed as used in good condition. When it arrived I was very surprised to find the cover was in like-new condition and the DVD didn't have a single scratch, smudge, or fingerprint on it. I would recommend this seller to anyone wanting a great quality used it. Thank you very much, my son is happy again."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"I took my son (age 6) to this and there was tremendous whining and squirming in the seats - by me. The humor is dreadful and the plot is moronic. The two main characters nearly kill a kangaroo then find it humorous to dress up the corpse in a coat. oooo - the hilarity that ensues. They're only in Australia to deliver money to a man doing a terrible Russell Crowe impression who will kill them upon doing so. (Yes, I'm revealing the plot, such as it is.)Our intrepid heroes meet a beautiful zoologist who is studying animals and trying to rescue an endangered species. Once they succeed retrieving the jacket, she of course abandons all her plans to live on a boat with our 'handsome' hero while the 'comic-relief' does cannonballs in the pool.Sound like fun - no."
3,Only PG??? Ouch! but Good Movie,"Good fun movie but CLEARLY PG-13 material. A full on breast grab? A couple in their skivies in a self proclaimed ""sensual"" moment? A knife to her throat and threatening to cut if she doesn't talk? Wow, how did this one slip by the rating people? They should have to watch this with kids.If you accept it is PG-13 and not for the little ones, it's a very funny movie."
2,Kangaroo got jacked,"What can one say about a film where the best performance was by a digitally created animal? That's right--Kangaroo Jack was the best performance in this movie, especially with his Australian accent, facial expressions, and the scene where he raps. I wish the movie would feature more of the Kangaroo and less about the childish plot using every Hollywood formula cliche they could throw in there, including mismatched buddies who have no real basis for a true friendship. I'm glad that this DVD has commentary by the Kangaroo himself, for maybe he can explain this movie to the audience. Although I didn't particularly find this movie all that funny, I bought the DVD just because I liked the kangaroo in the film (I'm a sucker for talking animals). Pair him up with Crocodile Dundee or Steve Irwin and you might have a much better movie."
2,Jerry O'Connell let my kids down,"Jerry O'Connell, what happened? You have always been my kids' favorite Hollywood star and a great role model for all - until Kangaroo Jack, that is. Your disingenuous attempt at children's cinema has gone unfulfilled, to put it mildly. As a strong and unyielding proponent of nonviolent and pure children's entertainment, I came away highly revolted and infinitely appalled at the depths of utter debauchery to which Jerry O'Connell has plunged with Kangaroo Jack.The violence(with and without the kangaroo) coupled with the inexcusable lewd and lascivious abundance of sexual innuendos(with and without the kangaroo) left me with an incurable case of nausea and vomiting. I am demonstrably mortified by O'Connell and his reprobate dereliction of moral decency. My kids loved him in Scream 2, but I won't let them watch Kangaroo Jack - no,sir - not my kids! I almost gave it 1 star - but then I remembered one thing - it's Jerry O'Connell."
2,"Lowbrow comedy, sometimes funny","When lifelong friends Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson) accidentally get mixed up in the mob, they are forced to deliver a large sum of money to some shady characters in Australia. When a wild kangaroo ""steals"" the money before it can be delivered, it's an all-out race to catch him to get the loot back before the mobsters find out it's missing. Silly slapstick ensues, but Anderson and O'Connell make a good comedy team.A mix of real and animatronic kangaroos were used.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,FUNNY! FUNNY!! ...FUNNNNNNNNY!!!,"May not be for the under 12 crowd, and more like PG-13 rather than PG, but one of the best slapstick comedies to come along in years. And with all the rauch in films today, I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading. Very little to make you blush in this one. So if you're over 12 and want an extremely fun experience, Kangaroo Jack will keep you laughing. Even the comment about being ""eaten like that baby"" when they were surrounded by dingos, referring to the 1980 baby Azaria/Lindy Chamberlain dingo abduction at Ayres Rock, was not done distastefully as some have complained.With some of the other popular comedies in recent years, widely viewed by many children(Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Rush Hour) to name but a few, compare them to the scenes and language of Kangaroo Jack. You'll be asking what's all the fuss about too. Almost innocent in comparision. Outstanding Kangaroo effects, great comedic pairing."
4,This IS a funny and entertaining movie.,I'm really surprised how this movie has gotten some bad reviews here.Sounds more like some people didn't like it because it doesn't conform to their own ideas of what a movie should be. I loved it for it's originality and entertainment. The whole family liked this one. No it's not a 5-star movie to go on the classics list. But it is a good movie. Enjoy it.
3,Jumpin' Jack,"The movie is cute, and great for a dvd release but I am glad I didn't waste the money at the theatre. Good for kids and adults alike."
3,"Funny, Silly and wierd !!","It wasn't a great movie, but indeed it was funny and silly. Worth the cost f the dvd."
1,This Is A Dumb Movie,"I didn't like it on many levels but mostly the basic movie plot. I also didn't like any of the characters playing. It's just a stupid movie! I suppose some people can find it funny, but they must be on something I am not. I hope to avoid anything these people make in the future."
5,wow....thats all i can say,Los Enanitos Verdes has once again proven that they are one of the few spanish rock bands that are true musicans. With each album they have demonstrated their ability to produce music that rocks. In this album you get to listen to them live. Maricano's way of singing and Felipe's way of playing guitar and Daniel's way of playing drums just takes you into a whole different world. All the songs are awesome. You cant go wrong if you buy this cd. If you have the opportunity to go see them play i strongly recommend that you go...believe me...its worth the money. Que viva el rock...Los Enanos!!!!
5,Creo que estoy 10 anios tarde para recien haber escuchado este Cd.,"The best of the Best. Lo maximo.Nunca he escuchado un cd acustico asi como este, de ninguna de las Bandas de Rock en Español.A Must Have"
1,You don't need this.,You really don't need to buy this if you are diabetic.It is simply an expectorant of 100 mg of Guaifensein.Ask the pharmcist for an over the counter version in pill form.The pills are easyer to take and don't taste as bad.If you need an allergy medicine as well you can simply takeChlorpheniramine 12 mg which is over the counter as well asCHLOR-TRIMETON. Both are acceptable types of cold and allergy medicines for diabetics and much easyer to find.If you are seriously ill you should see a doctor for a perscription medicine anyways since diabetics have a greater chance for infections.
4,Careful!,"The Library Journal review on this book's Amazon page says: ""These volumes provide as close to a self-portrait of the author as readers are likely to get."" But that sentence doesn't actually refer to ""Smile Please"" -- it's from LJ's review of the Rhys's ""Letters"".I apologize for rating this book as ""4 stars"" when I haven't seen it yet. Amazon won't let me post this warning without entering a rating."
3,"Fun, but not one of Wodehouse's best","Sally Smith is a no-nonsense kind of woman, both in her professional capacity as a physician and in her personal life. Bill Bannister is a good-hearted fellow with a habit of getting involved with the wrong girls. When he sees Sally, it is love at first sight, but can he convince her it's the real thing?This novella was originally serialised as ""The Medicine Girl"" in 1931 and later collected as part of ""The Crime Wave at Blandings"" (1937). It's a typical Wodehouse tale--a light breezy romantic comedy featuring a stately ancestral hall, a slightly potty uncle, and complicated plans that go awry.While Doctor Sally lacks the zesty zaniness of a comedic masterpiece, fans will find this amusing little dose of Wodehouse to be just what the doctor ordered.3.25 stars."
1,Monkeys,They say that a million mokeys on typewriters will in an eternity eventually write the works of Shakespear. I give this book 3 monkeys 10 minutes. Definitely Wodehouses worst!
1,"Tops--or bottoms--""The Tara Treasury""","Surprisingly, considering Harmetz's previous books, this volume is, without a doubt, the WORST book ever written on ""Gone With the Wind."" The text is riddled with mistakes, and many of the illustrations are mislabeled. Thank goodness, the book apparently has been a huge failure in the sales department, so there should be NO trade paperback edition. May it soon be ""gone with the wind"" ..."
5,"On the road to making ""Gone with the Wind""","Harmetz work is a welcome addition to the literature about the making of ""Gone with the Wind"". It doesn't pretend to be all-inclusive but what it does, it does well. The author uses broad strokes to set the scene and fills in with generous detail and reproduces illustrations (not found elsewhere) that were used to construct Margaret Mitchel's novel for the screen.For a wealth of well-researched and highly detailed information about GWTW, Haver's David O. Selznick's Gone with the Wind"" and ""David O. Selznick's Hollywood"" are *the* standards works together with Behlmer's ""Memo from David O' Selznick"".Harmetz' ""On the Road to Tara"" is an excellent supplement to these works detailing the making of Selnick's now legendary and timeless epic.Recommended."
3,Ok but Barron's is better,"I bought this and Barron's to read up as much as I could to place in the top percentile. While being a good book full of information necessary to pass the tests and interviews, I found the Barron's book to be more comprehensive. Still a good read and knowledge is power."
4,Outstanding Judgment and Interview Coverage,"We all like to think that there is some magic book out there that is worth the money we spent on it, and is helpful on every police test. Unfortunately most tests are made by different people, each carrying different content. Now I can't assure you that this book alone will come in handy for your next exam since it has poor memorization exercises which SOME tests seem to use too much of, but what I can tell you is that it definitely will increase your odds of getting a better score. My suggestion is buy a couple other well known test prep books, since it is a good investment because most police test now-a-days is around $25-75 bucks and months long processes. So save your time and money and be prepared."
3,???,I ordered this book for my husband and then he decided not to pursue this field. The book was never used. Sorry I couldn't be of more help in the review.
1,Item not received,"This item was purchased on October 18, and was not received. My money was refunded."
3,"No toxic smell, but not sturdy either","How funny that our experience with this crib was so different. We definitely didn't notice any smell from this crib at any time, but it certainly wasn't sturdy. After we put it together and went to move it, the bottom part of one of the legs just snapped right off!! We had to use wood glue to put it back together and now we are VERY gentle with it, when we have to move it for any reason. We were not happy. Otherwise, it's been adequate, but I wouldn't reccomend it."
4,A nice change,"I have a couple other Sansone DVDs, the difference with this one is that she uses 1-3 pound weights, so it's a bit more of a workout than some of the others. You also have the option of music only vs listening to her, and there's no group walking with her. I like that her workouts are simple and I don't have to think too much first thing in the morning when I want a workout. The down side of that is that they can get a little boring over time. I use these a couple of times a week when the weather is not conducive to getting outside early in the morning, otherwise I'd much rather just go for a walk."
3,"Same ol', Same ol'","I bought this DVD thinking it might be a bit different than the others I have based on some of the reviews. Sadly its not. Same exact moves with same exact music...just with hand weights. It moves pretty slowly too-but thats so you can safely add the weights. Now I gave this item 3 stars based on the fact that its still a great DVD (like all of Leslie's DVD's). The addition of the hand weights really does add a lot to this workout but take out the hand weights and its exactly like others. So if your an avid Leslie fan and have a bunch of her DVD's, save your money and just do some of her slower workouts and had hand weights. However if your new to this and want a workout that burns fat and adds arm muscle, this is perfect for you."
5,Leslie Sansone: Burn Body Fat,I love this video and have used it quite often. It is a great workout and makes me feel good afterwards. It helps me get my pulserate up and does what I had hoped.
1,Worst Leslie Sansone DVD,"So disappointing! I have used her DVDs a lot over the course of the last 10 years, and I was looking forward to shaking up my routine with a fresh version. Unfortunately, this video is so poorly made that I was distracted throughout the entire routine. The transitions between moves are awkward. She doesn't count down to begin or end movements. She is caught off guard by the change in musical pace. There is no clock counting down the minutes. What you do get is a bizarre pink bar at the bottom that flashes miles and healthy phrases with a weird stripper outline commonly found on trucker's tire flaps.Spend your money on her videos produced by Exercise TV. They are well made and challenging!"
3,IT'S OK.....,"Like this one better than other recent DVD's, but it could be better. Choregraphy could be better & still not very challenging if you are used to Leslie's workouts. The best thing about this one is that it's not a remake of her past DVD's which is a nice change. Leslie definitely needs some new material!!!"
2,Return,"Unfortunately, I had to return the video. It did not work at all. The pixels were jumping all over the screen."
4,One of my faves from Leslie,"I love this workout. One of my favorites that I've done, from Leslie!! She is really focused on this one (not too talkative or laughing too much, etc.). That's what I really liked about this video. Great workout, highly recommend!"
5,Seasoned Love Can Be Great!,"Heard about this DVD through the same friend that told me to read books like Seasoned Romance, Grandpa Does Grandma, and Better Than I Expected It to Be. Glad I listened.The story of Bill and Desiree is truly compelling. The love scenes are graphic, but that's a good thing.This is a great DVD, whether you are a seasoned senior or not. Buy it!"
5,"Realistic, loving video","This video is very happy to watch as the couple obviously like each other. The film maker showed the utilitarian details, like a towel on the bed and lubricant which is the reality of love making. Realistic, loving, gentle, this is an excellent video."
4,Jon Pareles,"I have a solid respect for Jon Pareles initial review, to my opinion he captures the essence of it best..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"I, like many others who have tried this product (do some homework) have had problems with the CTRL key as well as other functional issues. I did not have the time to return the item within the 30 day limit, much to my dismay.Yes, it is a novelty, and is relatively inexpensive, but until a cordless version arrives, don't bother."
1,if i could give zero,"This keyboard is a piece of junk. It seemed nice, and other reviewers did warn me, but I was overly optimistic. The keys were hard to work, even on a flat surface, because the left side has that big hunk of plastic that elevates it just enough to make sure that the keys on the left side of the keyboard are off of the surface you have the keyboard on. In addition to these drawbacks, it simply just stopped working after one week (my usb port will not recognize that there is a device plugged into it). If I could give zero stars for this product, I would."
1,Rolled up junk,"I bought this keyboard so i can type while playing final fantasy 11 on my xbox but didnt want something that would take up alot of space boy was that a mistake this keyboard broke after a weak of use, if you roll it up the wrong way the buttons jam or just stop working. Until i bought a replacement keyboard my side of the in-game conversations would look like this""T4kin9 a br34k 9oin9 to thron3 room""not so cool now huh."
4,Not bad,Some of the keys are a little sketchy ... and the housing that fits the cord could be a little more solid -- but otherwise this is a good roll-up keyboard. The colors are definitely cool.
4,Does the job,"The keys have a nice feel and it's easy to use. I wouldn't use it as my everyday keyboard, but as a backup it's great and it doesn't take up much space."
3,Great for the price,This keyboard rolls up beautifully but the space to depress the keys is shallow and a little hard to use. It works fairly consistently and the drivers seem to load well.
5,Terrific,"This is one of the few albums I own in which I like almost every song on it. My only real criticism is with the ordering of the songs--I have an old 33 1/3 record, not the CD. This, of course, is one of the advantages of a CD. The album includes:SIDE 1: cheap love, you make me want to make you mine (my favorite song on the entire album), hurt, old flame (title song), stuck in the middle with you (recorded by other artists too).SIDE 2: feel a whole lot better (catchy melody, interesting lyrics), what can I do with my heart, with you (upbeat), one touch (very good IMHO), let your woman take care of you.Most of the songs are quite upbeat; all are well done with clever lyrics. It's a very fine album--especially if you are into her genre."
1,RIP OFF!!!!,Out of the somewhat 22 minutes of footage.There are about 5 minutes of Beatles.Don't waste your time. Avoid it if possible.
5,I couldn't put it down,"I became a fan of Irene Nemirovsky after reading Suite Francaise and was anxious to read her daughter's book. To read this fictionalized account of what Elisabeth Gille endured and how she dealt with the horrors was engrossing to say the least. Very well written, very articulate. I did not want to put it down. She did not shy away from the realities of the Holocaust, but dealt with them very honestly."
2,"Very bad, but still a lot of fun","This is a horrible movie about Chan Wei Man learning kung fu and then using his skills for evil. Bruce Li goes to take him down and also to rescue some girl. The only good part about the movie is the number of great kung fu actors. They all are in plenty of fight scenes. San Kwai, Funk Hak-on, Nick Cheung, and Chen Sing also star. The end of the movie is crazy. It is just fight after fight, including Bruce Li fighting a guy in a gorilla costume! A must see for kung fu lovers that also love bad movies. And don't worry, I know everyone is thinking ""how could a man defeat a huge gorilla?"" Well, luckily Chen Sing is part ape and he shows up to help Bruce Li out. I was pretty scared there for a minute.1.5/5This movie is included in theKung Fu 20 Movie Packand has watchable picture quality."
4,C'mon,"Veggies....70's music....What's there not to love? The only reason that I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of the versions are hard to understand if you don't know the origional. This is a small problem for my 3 year old. However, with Daddy singing them with her and Mommy rolling her eyes in the corner, she gets the idea!"
1,Horrible,"The back hinges cracked and fell off after only two years, the screen flops around and has to be propped against something to use. Gateway doesn't care.Google MX7118 cracked hinges and you'll see I'm not the only one.Big and way too heavy to transport anywhere. Major clunker."
2,Great while it lasted,"I bought this to split oak and it did great. I appreciated the weight and length....but after a bad swing, the shaft shattered near the head and completely separated. Luckily it missed my head, feet, etc when it flew free. If there were a warranty, I would recommend to anyone."
1,Don't even bother looking at this item......,My husband said he wanted a splitting maul for Christmas. I purchased this one because the reviews seemed good (I really was uneducated when it came to mauls). He used it twice and the head fell off of it!!!!! He has been cutting timber forever. I felt horrible when he told me what had happened. This is by far the worst maul he has ever used. Do not purchase it.
4,Decent set. Most of what you'll need to install.,"These speakers are decent, and relatively easy to install. They do not include all the wire you'll most likely need, depending on your installation. In my truck I used up all the included wire for the tweeters, and the woofers required me to purchase more.You'll also want some good dual sided tape (I recommend 3m) to mount the crossover somewhere. They include some screws, but most installations you'll be better off with the tape mounting.Tweeter mounts were good, they look a bit cheap when you open them up but they hold up well.Speaker sound is decent, and they can be driven up to 90W, so you'll most likely be looking for an AMP after a few weeks with these and a normal head unit. Don't expect anything high fidelity, but they do their job and will be an improvement over most any stock speakers."
3,A great idea that doesn't exactly pay off!!,"Kavanagh & Pollina put together a decent story here that tells the untold origin of Apocalpyse, one of the X-Universe's greatest villains. I loved the ties to ancient Egypt and even Rama-Tut but the ties to the Marvel Universe were to loose. They were mentioned and even shown but too quickly glossed over. This series could have used two more issues to expand on the back story. The art was at times hard to distinguish between characters. I loved certain panels and then scratched my head on others. Overall, the ideas were good but the execution wasn't."
4,APOCALYPSE? ... EGYPT? ... COOL.,"Apart from being the X-Men's most dangerous enemy, Apocalypse is one of my favorite X-Men villains (he may even be my favorite X-Men villain). I was rather surprised to read the other reviewers' thoughts about Apocalypes's origin story. I thought the storyline was pretty good, although I do agree with the detractors that it could've been better than what it was. But I wouldn't say it SUCKED either. The artwork is awesome! Really good stuff. If you have the money and time, check this out. It's pretty good."
5,a good listen!,"Tulare Dust is a great tribute from various songwriters to Merle's songwriting talent. They've each chosen a favorite, and put their own personal twist to the tune...great interpretation."
3,The music can't be touched,"This is very good CD. The only problem is that Merle's music is so good, it's tough to cover. I listen to the CD fairly often and especially enjoy this version of Big City. Buy it, but understand, if you want to hear the best, buy Merle's originals!"
3,great collection of songs,"Some good covers, some great covers: Tulare Dust, Shopping for Dresses, Holding things Together are stand-outs."
4,Wilbur scores again!,"Wilbur faithfully reproduces some of Moliere's more experimental versification in this update of Plautus' Amphitruo, the story of Greek general who is impersonated by the god Jupiter-- so that Jupiter can share a bed with his wife! Moliere, a master of farce, plays this mistaken identity to its comic hilt.Wilbur's translation here is peerless and his Afterword is wonderfully informative. This is not my favorite of his Moliere translations (I like The School for Wives and The Misanthrope) but I'd be hard-pressed to name a fault. Voltaire said of this play, ""I laughed so hard that I fell over backwards."" I didn't fall over backwards, but I got a good chuckle or two out if it."
3,"Quack Quack, throw me back!",My Granddaughter loved it for two days and then it was forgotten and avoided. Did what it said it would.
3,Cute - but small,This is a cute little stuffed animal. But it is small. Make sure to check out the measurements before buying if you're looking for a larger stuffed animal.
5,Everything I thought it would be,I ordered this jacket after searching for a coat for my big frame. I really enjoy the deep pockets on the outside and the drawstrings to keep myself snug in the coat. It is what I wanted and needed for a great price.
1,Dissapointed,"I was sad about this order. I Received the large vacuum package of Marcona Almonds. They taste terrible, almost rancid!!! What do I do with 2.2 lbs. of yucky nuts?"
4,"Really Good, But...","This may be the prime example of how a live performance transcends any recorded experience. I have read all the rave reviews of Donna Murphy's performance and trust people's judgment: she must have been wonderful in person. In this recording, however, she struggles through four or five different accents, settling somewhere between a voice from Missippi by way of New York.It seems less a performance than a gimmick.As a kid I heard my parents play the Rosalind Russell version of this show a hundred times and I guess she is imprinted in my mind as Ruth Sherwood.The orchestrations here sound magnificent and there are a few tracks added which round out the experience."
3,Good Piece,"This show is nice, very broadway. The music is nice, lyrics fun, and whole show a nice piece. It isn't something I would listen to over and over which is why it's only getting three stars, but it isn't something that I won't play from time to time. Of the two recordings I have (this one and the 2004 revival) there are MINISCULE differences, but I would say this is the better of the two. I like Donna Murphy's character over Brooke Shields. Good CD for collectors and new broadway listners alike. Fav Song: ""Conga"""
1,Not Wonderful,"Jennifer Westfeldt hits all the notes required for the role of Eileen, yet her voice isn't my favorite. Donna Murphy's voice is not great either. The real talent there is Gregg Edelman, but I honestly prefer him along Brooke Shields and Jennifer Hope Wills."
1,BAD!!!!!!,"After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give this musical a try. I excpected it to be a whole lot better. I thought it was a worthless, boring and tasteless musical. I can't believe anyone could love this senseless piece of junk! You are way better off with Wicked which is a treasure!"
2,Limited appeal,"I bought this pretty much impulsively, having no knowledge of the so-called artist, and expecting a learning experience. I have rarely been more disappointed with an album. It appears that Mr. Dale knows a few guitar techniques and uses every one in every tune with the result being that every tune sounds far too much alike to suit me. While Mr. Dale does have skills, and his application of those skills is done very well, the repetition of those techniques becomes tedious and consequently listening to more than one tune at a time becomes annoying. I do regret the purchase.BrianI suppose that I might have liked the album more if it wasn't an attempt to duplicate Link Wray......"
2,Dick dales tribal thunder,"This is the second Dick Dale CD I have purchased my first was ""King of the surf guitar, The best of Dick Dale and the Del-tones"". I was very impressed with that CD but did not know what to expect with this CD. I have purchased some mid 90's surf guitar music that sounds retro but the songs on this CD do not sound like surf music to me. The title cut is an acoustic version of Dick Dales big hit ""Miserlou"" but I wonder why he changed the title of the song? There were two other songs from the first CD I bought that carried over on to this alblum making 3 songs that were retreads so to speak and the original versions of the songs were better by far. I would have much prefered all new songs for the money I spent on the CD. If you are a hardcore Dick Dale fan this is a good CD to buy but if you are looking for a good representation of the 90's surf music scene look elsewhere."
2,Toy Box,"We had some problems with the toy box. The hinges work well and the box is spacious enough. The wood is very delicate. I chipped a big chunk of it off as I was putting the box together. Maybe I am not the most proficient at putting it together, but it should be able to withstand an active toddler."
1,Not the same quality. REALLY disappointed in these.,"Like others who have done reviews, I bought these over 5 years ago from Macy's and fell in love with them. I bought replacements at the Mikasa outlet in Redding that were the same quality, so I expected that any future similar replacement purchases would be the same. Boy, was I wrong. I ordered 4 boxes @ $69.95 a box, twenty dollars more than orinally paid. I thought that since it's been 5 years, they went up in price due to popularity. Nope. These were paper thin around the top, completely different from the ones I bought years ago. One run in the dishwasher and two were broken. Complete disappointment. There are definitely two different grades or the quality has just taken a nose dive intentionally. These would break just handwashing them. I will never buy them again."
1,Down to 1,"4 years ago we got 3 sets of these as wedding gifts. We are now down to our final glass. They break when you look at them funny. Aesthetically appealing, though, hence the single star. Go another direction with you cash."
5,Purrrrfect,"Gotta have one if you have chinchillas. This was perfect - came before I expected, was carefully packaged so it was in perfect shape. And while I already knew why and how to use it, the directions were simple."
1,"OK Product, but Amazon is terrible...","I just want to start out by saying the only reason this is getting a bad review is to deter you from buying it on this site. Amazon is the worst about sending items completely unprotected and causing them to be broken when they arrive. This item was shipped in a box far too big for it and the only thing protecting it was a single piece of bubble packaging on the TOP of the item, not on the bottom where it would need the cushion. I will say that my chin loves this thing, sleeps on it constantly. But it is very brittle granite. Not nearly worth the price. We have a big cage with 4 levels, so I've decided to put another one of these on the second level as well, HOWEVER, I am using one of those granite cutting boards instead. Its all the same to them really. They just like anything that keeps them cold. So go buy a small granite cutting board for 5 bucks and save your money."
3,Chinchillas don't use it,"I purchased one of these a year or two ago for my two chinchillas. They almost never sit on it, even in summertime when it's warmer. I have two ceramic tiles (6""x8"", which I got for free) in their cage and they prefer those over the granite stone. The product itself is fine - durable and easy to clean, but they just don't seem to use it."
3,Only if you don't have air conditioning,"I got this on recommendation from the pet store when I first got my Chin. It's really kind of pointless though unless you live in a house that doesn't have air conditioning. We have a/c and some days we don't use it, and so it gets a little toasty (not unbearable) and I've put this in the Chin's cage just as a precaution and she just ignores it. I would guess for it to have any real purpose, the environment would have to be pretty darn warm. In that case, you better get two or three and keep rotating them so your Chin can stay cool."
2,Frustration,"If nothing else, this video helps one to appeciate the hard work and dedication that goes into good ballet. This is not good ballet at any point.This video was an exercise in frustration. The viewer has no idea as to the training level of the participants and, therefore, cannot make a fair assessment of the proficiency. It occurred to me that the dancers were not acting in concert or taking responsibility for mistakes individually. There was no energy or interest by either dancer. I got the impression that neither wanted to be there. Even the teacher seemed detached, leaving a desire to hear what corrections were being made.The technical aspects of this video were lacking: light, sound, and editing.May I suggest the intruction video titled Yvette Chauvire, France's Prima Ballerina Absoluta. Would-be dancers can see what the relationship of teacher and dancer should be. The respect for experience and fame is obvious."
4,Beautiful glassware,"I bought this set of four differently patterned glasses because I had broken one from my older set from Mikasa. The new glasses are noticeably thinner glass (on the sides) and lighter weight, and I was somewhat disappointed at first. However, after using them for awhile, alongside my older, heavier glasses, I have decided that only I would know the difference, and most people would appreciate the beautiful designs etched on the glasses and completely different on each glass, and not the weight or thickness.I also received the first order with all but one glass shattered, but I called Amazon and was cheerfully sent a new set overnight at no cost."
2,Look nice - very thin!,"I really liked the look of these glasses when I received them. They have a nice weight to them (weighted bottom)but I was surprised at how VERY thin the sides were. Unfortunately, upon first use, I now have a large crack on the side of one of the glasses from filling it with ice from my run of the mill freezer door ice dispenser. As thin as they are, I should have known better and not filled the glass directly from the ice dispenser, but lesson learned. I will be more careful with my 3 remaining glasses, but am very disappointed that the first one broke so easily. Beware!"
5,High-Quality Glasses with a Fun Twist,"If you pick up one of these glasses with your eyes closed, you can't help but picture two tycoons smoking cigars, drinking scotch and discussing an important deal. Yet, if you open your eyes and set the glass down, you will find the patterns are as light and airy as the glasses are weighty. These glasses are a fun and refreshing twist on an old standard."
3,Mikasa cheers glasses,Picture and description were not quite precise and we did get a product that was not exactly as we hoped. Nevertheless Amazon was the only supplier thst could even come close to what we required
2,Poor Plot and Writing Douse Burn,"This book was the subject of a September 2, 1997, Wall Street Journal article, which recounted how the author has spent some $34,000 to set fire to sales. Sadly, the book is not very good. The plot is silly beyond belief, the characters (except for one that gets killed off three-fifths of the way through) are not very likable--including the ""hero,"" and the dialogue is mostly stilted. Touted as the first of a series starring Ed Burke, Fire Marshall, Peter Lance will be lucky if there is another. If there is, let's hope that his evident screen-writing skills (he's written a couple of TV scripts) will translate to the novel form. So far, at least, they have not. First Degree Burn is neither first-degree nor hot."
2,Another Morriconne Collection,"This compilation is gifted with lush photographs that depict the films they represent. However, not only are there far more vibrant Morriconne compilations available but the majority of these ""rare"" tracks already exist on other compilations. I love and treasure anything by Morriconne but, this compilation seems inappropriate especially with the Thriller Collection available (which mirrors this compilation in selections and tone). Out of the Argento/Morriconne collection, main titles compilations, and miscellaneous other soundtracks this one ranks among Wolf at a groveling beautiful suspensful mediocrity. But, when mediocore is written in the same sentence as Morriconne; one can only expect it to be the most heavenly kind of medicore."
3,Pros and Cons..,Pros:Ennio Morricone was a terrific experimental composer. This music is Wierd.Cons:Kind of wierd combination of songs.. a lot of them don't feel like they should be on the same album.
1,"Love Morricone, hate this collection","It's as if they took the most obnoxious parts they could find, and memorialized them.Morricone is the master. But this collection misrepresents his genius.I guess the Dissonance part in the title excuses all."
3,Round Our Way,"After seeing this group on PBS television some 20 years ago and was very impressed with their performance, I eventually found out that they had made an album as well. So I bought it used for a great price here. I listened to all the tracks. Being a music aficionado, I ""subjectively"" found the album somewhat mediocre and boring. The problem I found that dragged down the Album was not the the song selection which was pretty good, also the harmonizing was great, ""but"" the swapping out of various ""lead singers"" that were not really ""lead singer material"" produced a very amateurish boring album. The girl that sang ""Don't let your heart"" I believe her name is ""Debbie Longsworth"" should have been the designated lead singer, and the album would be much better consistently. And maybe the group wouldn't have died out so quickly, who's to say."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Watch out for these... the lampshades on these are really fragile. Taking them out of the box alone made little dents that I thought were no big deal at first, but when you turn the lamps on, they show up as dark spots. Not good. But they look exactly as they do in the picture, and give a nice contemporary look for a low price."
4,Behind the Player: Robbie Merrill,"The only complaint I really have about this DVD is it is hard to follow the moving tab in the ""play along"" portion. It can't be slowed down which is something I like to be able to do when learning a new song. I think it would also be nice to have written tab included in the booklet so you could follow along more easily and practice without having to run the DVD.Other than that this DVD rocks! Robbie is one of my favorite bassists! I would love to play like that!"
1,Not what I was looking for,"Not what I was looking for, I emailed the seller & never heard back on whether they accept returns. I was looking for small business software & this was terrible."
2,Poorly written and patronizing,"Mr. Roskind's book means well, but quickly devolves into a platform to prove his spiritual superiority. The best, most useful parts of the book are transcribed conversations with real Rastafari people, when he or his wife don't interupt them with inane, well-meant comments. His interviews are poor journalism full of leading questions and unecessary commentary that distracts from the message of JAH's people. His insistance that old Hippies are American Rasta is disingenuous, simplistic and self-decieving. If you truly feel drawn to the way of the Rastafari, look deeper than this book. Also the 40 photos touted on the cover are mostly his vacation photos, including one of a deserted motel pool. They add little to the book."
5,Babylon is Falling,"If you feel that society has or has not taken a peice of your mind, I would advise you to read this book. I do not feel that it is a book that you can read at once, or once for that matter. I think I am on my third or fourth reread of this book. Roskind takes the power of communication through the Babylon system to prove there is more to what the western world calls life. I picked up the book in a gear issue room from the National Outdoor Leadership School in Conway, WA. I began to read the book outside of civilivation and coming back in to society after reading the tales in Rasta Heart has me looking at the world with a new pair of eyes. As they would say in the book, one love."
5,Amazing,"I have not finished reading this book yet, but what I have read is absolutely amazing. I love this book! It gives you a great insight to Rasta life and Jamaican lifestyles."
5,Wonderful!,"This was just an amazing book! I just loved it. I am a ""Jamaica Freak"". I love Jamaica and love to read and learn all I can. My last trip there was so much more meaningful after having read this book. It really gets into the heart of the people. I was changed by this book in a very positive way. A wonderful insight into a very magical people."
3,cuts in pkg,"The item was supposed to be new and it looked like it until it was unwrapped. The box for the item was cut with a knife or razor through to the plastic holding the dvds . The shrink wrap had no such marks anywhere which lead me to believe it was shrink wrapped at a later time, after the indecent. The dvds dont`t appear to be damaged therefore I gave them a three star rating only.."
5,Cagney at his finest,An American treasure. A classic in the truest sense of the word.Cagney was magnificent as George M Cohen.
5,Excellent transaction.,Received my order one day ahead of schedule which was a surprise. Order was a great price and was exactly what was promised. Will continue to do business with Amazon as always.
5,"CLASSIC CAGNEY, GREAT MOVIE","CAGNEY IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A LEGEND, MAN WAS AND IS UNSURPASSED AS AN ACTOR/PERFORMER. THE MOVIE IS GREAT AND ENTERTAINING, TODAY'S MOVIES SHOULD BE SO GREAT."
4,Yankee Doodle Dandy,"I purchased this movie for my husband, it is one of his favorites because of the music. He enjoyed it very much!"
4,yankee doodle dandee,"Great movie, favourite James Cagney movie of all time! My only disappointment was that I thought it was in colour not black and white but still fantastic."
4,Our country was at war...and so was the rest of the world!,"This movie was done during WWII and it must have been a huge hit them and now it's a classic! It's a great bio and all the actors were great and especially Cagney!James Cagney always played tough guys and this time he took a shot and was a song and dance guy...wonderful job! I like watching good movies twice during the same week so I don't miss something.In fact I gave this movie to a friend to enjoy as well! Great actors aren't always in great movies,but this one has one of the world biggest stars at the time plus it was wartime .Great combo for a liftup for our country to forget about the war for 2- 2 1/2 hours!"
2,Poor Copy,"This movie was colorized several years ago. I saw this color version when it was first completed. Beautiful costumes and show colors!What I received here was a copy of a copy of a copy, of a copy of a copy, etc. The movie is blurry, the colors washed out, and the final 5 minutes are black & white, with very poor sound. I could not recommend this version to anyone. I will keep my old black and white version. Thank you."
1,Yankee Doodle Dvd,"Very disapointing.....the voice and video did not match so it was very distracing to watch. For a dvd ""classic"" edition I expected better quality. Would have returned it but by the time I watched it I had lost the receipt."
5,Colorized Yankee Doodle Dandy,"Have wanted this movie for many many years. Am 75 and had to order twice. First New skipped and no good from aokmovies2. They never even replied to me. Amazon credited full amount and bought second tape from Boswell. He is terrific. Good vendor, reliable. Cecy Ivie"
5,Yankee Doodle Dandy,"In my opinion this was James Cagney's best role as an actor, and that is saying something thinking about all the classic movies he stared in. This movie not only showed what a great actor Cagney was but he sings and dances into your heart as George M. Cohan. Absolutely a truly great movie!"
5,yankee doodle dandy is the best!!!!!!!,"THE MOVIE YANKEE DOODLE DANDY IS THE BESR MUSICAL EVER MADE.THE GENIUS OF GEORGE M.COHAN(1878-1942) IS BEAUTIFULLY BROUGHT OUT IN THE PEFORMANCE.I OWN THE VHS,CD AND ON SEPTEMBER 30,2003 I SHALL PURCHASE THE DVD.I HOPE ALL OF YOU WILL ALSO!!!!!!!"
4,High energy action without the explosions.,"Before the high tech action movies, before the nudity and foul language, they had to do it with good acting, directing and writing. When you also have a story wrapped around a musical, the music has to be good also. This movie has it all. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sing. And what a supporting cast. Remember when then had to load up a bad movie with starts in hopes it would help sell the movie. This one is loaded, but the movie and music are wonderful. Family friendly also."
5,real american treasure,"The colorized version is a great edition to add to your black and white dvd edition.Its only available in color on VHS so this is the best there is.The flags are just mesmerizing and certainly adds to the excellence of this fine film and everything else,the songs,the overwhelming patriot feeling garnered from this colored edition is worth a Congressional Metal of Honor to James Cagney for his great performance as George M Cohan.If you can get this on amazon then run don't walk.Note:Exceptional performance by Joan Leslie.Check out some of her other movies.This colorized VHS presentation is fabulous.The black and white edition is great though and depicts the times in 42 and like the war and even though its B@W the movie adds color to the fighting men who served for our freedom. Wouldn't it be nice if Warner Brother put out a special 3 disc 70th Anniversary colorized and the original B@W copy and off course blu ray too.there you go that is my wish !!!!!"
5,All American,This movie has always been one of my favorites. Now even better in color. Just wish they would bring it out in Blu-ray.
5,A True Classic,"One of my favorites of all time. As many times as I've seen it, I still get chills when Cagney tap dances down the stairs in the White House."
5,Patriotic and Fantastic: Yankee Doodle Dandy,"I remember seeing this movie when I was very young. I decided to look for it to add to our DVD collection as a good patriotic movie. It was just as I remembered. James Cagney is wonderful. Who would believe the tough gangster could be such a wonderful dancer? It is a good family movie, even though the younger generation might not appreciate it being B/W. My husband made the comment that he didn't even notice it was B/W after getting caught up in watching the story unfold. I highly recommend this DVD as the special features were very informative and entertaining, too."
4,Yankee Doodle Dandy still a classic!,Yankee Doodle Dandy is a 'must see' on the 4th of July! The extras that came with the DVD is well worth watching to get an in depth view of how the movie was made. Great dancing and it really gets you in the patriotic frame of mind for the 4th.
4,A wonderfully gentle book,"This book is a wonderful way to introduce someone to the concept, but not the ""how-to"", of yoga. Because the author writes very honestly of his own physical limitations, it's particularly useful as a means to encourage anyone to try yoga, especially those who are intimiated by all the bendy yogis and yoginis shown in how-to yoga books. But Walton's attitude towards yoga is so wonderfully simple and refreshing, the book also can serve as a great pick-up to those who feel their yoga practice has grown a little stale or become too superficial. Pick up a copy if you can find one!"
5,Treasures III is NOT region encoded,"Just a note to clear up the region-code confusion mentioned at the end of a previous review. The Treasures III DVD set has NO region code (that is, it's ""Region 0,"" not ""Region 1""). However, part of the first pressing WAS mistakenly coded ""Region 1."" These discs have been replacd in undistributed sets, but for any buyers outside North America who have trouble playing these early discs, the National Film Preservation Foundation will send region-free replacement copies at no charge; see their website,[...], and the form at [...].(I'm curator of the set, so pardon the 5 stars, which I'd award to the 20 audio commentators.)"
2,disapointing,HAVING BOUGHT THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES OF THIS SERIES I WAS LOOKING FOREWARD TO THIS THIRD INSTALLEMENT.BUT HAVING VIEWED A SAMPLE OF THIS COLLECTION I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.NONE OF THE FOUR FEATURES INCLUDED ARE OUTSTANDING EXAMPLES OF SILENT CINEMA.WHILE THE NUMEROUS SHORTS ARE PRETTY DISPENSABLE.THERE'S NOTHING OF THE QUALITY OF HELL'S HINGES OR LADY WINDERMERES'S FAN [BOTH INCLUDED ON VOLUME'S 1 AND 2]AND THE MANY EDUCATIONAL FILM'S ON THIS SET ARE BORING AND WORTHLESS.I MIGHT ADD THAT THE NFPF ARE GUILTY OF FALSE ADVERTISING AS THEY CLAIM THESE DISC'S ARE REGION FREE WHEN THEY REGION ONE ONLY.SO OVERSEAS BUYER'S BEWARE.
5,Forever fresh and original.,"No one can give life and vigor and interpretation to a song as well as Hank Snow. His voice and guitar carry him far beyond all other artists. ""I've Been Everywhere"" illustrates his absolute mastery of novel tongue-twisters; ""Over the line illustrates his sensitive interpretation of lyrics. Thanks, Hank, for decades of musical joy."
1,Not helpful to Protestants,"Like I said in the title, this book won't help Protestants who want to disprove the Catholic Church. Any Catholic with even a moderate Catholic education could refute these Protestant arguments."
5,Excellent,"I had picked up a book by Michelle in a public library in virginia and i thought this author is deeply connected to GOD. Later faced a terrible relationship and though gathered the strength to leave it, felt stuck helplessly to let go emotionally. I searched for some help on Amazon for her writings and found this book ""Release the pain, Embrace the joy"". I have no words but deep gratitude that i came across it and this has given me divine perspective on my trauma and is helping me to make sense out of my nonsense experience. It has helped me tremendously to let go this wasteful relationship mentally also with no feeling of resentment. Michelle does not sound preachy but as a friend she talks to you out of your pain. Please read it if you are facing or have faced a relationship failure."
1,Canopy,You get what you pay for. Cheap Cheap Cheap. The frame work for this canopy is made out of very light metal and is easy to bend out of shape. Would not take much wind to fold this set up down. Might be ok for a indoor event or a one time use outside. The storage bag however was well built. After we bent our frame beyond repair during set up we trashed it and bought a EZ-UP canopy.
3,A Disappointment,"Yeah, yeah, I know: this is a very European book and I'm not a European so I wouldn't understand; and the protagonists were witty and gentle; and the villain had a conscience; etc. etc. But this curious police procedural fails as a compelling read. With a wonderful setting like Amsterdam, you'd think the author would have conveyed some of the atmosphere of that fine city. He didn't. His descriptions of people and places were soul-less. The chatter between the two detectives often was inane. Just as often, they acted like Keystone kops. The story was marginally interesting, but at no point did I feel excitement or suspense. I realize that de Wetering has written a significant body of work and has legions of fans. I guess I'm just not one of them. Sadly, I felt the ""Outsider in Amsterdam"" was, in this case, me."
3,Enjoyable visit to mid-70's Amsterdam,"Charming and fun: An enjoyable few hours in mid-70's Amsterdam, with engaging detectives, an interesting city and appealing suspects. The author was apparently a serious student of Zen Buddhism. There's a murder and investigation, but Van de Wetering is engaged more with characters than crime. ""Outsider in Amersterdam"" is the first of a series."
3,Not a bad detective story,"Good read on a trip to Amsterdam. A little dated, but a fun read. Nothing special, but might read another one on my next trip."
5,Take a peek in Amsterdam,"This mystery had insights, for this American reader, into daily life in Amsterdam, race and colonial relations in Europe, economics of the drug trade, and careers in the civil service. The characters all had soul, aspirations, and foibles. For once, I feel more enlightened after finishing a detective novel.The plot jumped all over the place and the Kindle translation had many mistranscriptions, but it all was highly entertaining."
3,For sci-fi geeks only,"First of all it doesn't make any sense to buy groups like these unless you can find enough redeeming features in all of them to make them worth watching. I thought the most about the Day After Tomorrow, the weakest of the group. I found that if you ignore the pretense, i.e., that the world is going freeze up, flood, and otherwise go to hell all within a few days, its not so bad. Watch it for the effects. The Terminator is an easy pick, and while I, Robot did not in any meaningful way track the classic Asimov story it does have its good points. You just wonder why they didn't follow the Asimov story to begin with. If you're a sci-fi geek, go for it. Otherwise, buy The Terminator and forget the other two."
2,Satisfied,Excellent update except for The Terminator. I guess the original film is not good enough to enhance the movie detail as it did for the other two movies in this combo package. The sound for The Terminator is not enhanced and makes me wish I had passed on this Blu-ray disc.
5,Blu Ray must have,"very good price, movies you must have, I Robot with Will Smith great Story and awesome effects, the same with The Day after Tomorrow, terminator the quality is not the best but it is better for the dvd version, I love this pack, I recomend you. Additionaly the section of special features is full of exclusive material. each one of B ray has at least five hours of content"
4,arrived quickly,hope it works. Its a gift so I dont know yet how it is. Will let you know once it is setup
3,"Still a Binchy fan, but... (spoilers)","Something about this novel irked me. Binchy went into so much detail throughout, then wrapped up fast and sent half the cast packing back to America. It was as if she just got tired of the story and wanted to end it. I also think Maggie's death was entirely superfluous. It didn't help the plot a bit.If this book goes into another edition, if I were Binchy, I'd leave Maggie alone and iron out the end more: Kerry's connections with Dara, McCann, and Rachel; Patrick's connections with Kate or anyone else; the Ryans. Also, leaving Kate pregnant at the end was no consolation to me."
2,Not at all engaging,"To sum up in one word - disappointed. This is by far Binchy's weakest work - yet the one that is most raved about. Too many characters, too much tragedy and not enough HOPE. For a really good read, immerse yourslf in 'Circle Of Friends' or 'Light A Penny Candle'."
3,Great - Until the End,"I've been a fan of Binchy for many years now. I especially like the long, epic stories. I enjoy getting to know the characters, following the tale and settling in for the great story she is laying out for me. However, with Firefly Summer, I found many questions regarding/related to key plot lines went unanswered as the story ran out. Yes, the story ran out - without filling in the gaps - that is why I rated as I did. If I invest the time to read a 645 page book, I want the end to be rewarding. An ending doesn't have to be a happy one for me to feel satisfied, just leave me with some finality.Will continue to read Maeve Binchy, she's great. I highly recommend most all of her books. This just wasn't one of my favorites."
2,Unsatisfying tragedy--needs a sequel badly,"A slow read with an unsatisfying ending--not recommended. This feels like a draft rather than a finished work.After 600+ pages, the plot has wound itself into a corner and is crying out for serious editing and revision. As it stands, it would take at least another 100 or so pages to satisfactorily wind up the loose ends. Rather than undertake the major editorial surgery of excising a pointless tragedy, thereby freeing up those 100 pages, the author just blows everything away. Three pages of denouement is woefully insufficient. It's hard to believe that a (competent?) editor went along with this.The well drawn characters, positive balance between the generation, insightful cultural portrayals are delightful but don't begin to rescue the book for me."
3,I loved it until the end.,"I was really enjoying this book until the end. I adore the way Maeve Binchy's characters speak and she has a lovely sense of humor. I loved so many of the characters in this book and had no problem with how many there were. I would have given this book 5 stars happily if the ending had been different. It just left way too many things up in the air, as if she just ran out of steam."
4,A wonderful story of the ironies of life.,"The story like all Maeve Binch books was well written and gave a picture of a loving and inspirational town. The town goes through ups and downs. there are the characters you can't get enough of and the characters you feel you've wasted too much of your reading time on. I felt that there had to be more, some of the characters were left hanging without there situation being resolved. As the reader I want to be able to have the whole picture, I want my favourite characters to have a happy ending or an ending at all would suit me. The irony of the story touched me, and made me realize whatever your dreams are they're not always dreams that can be lived out. Although the downs out weighed the ups (so much tragedy, not enoough happiness) you had a feeling that this is what real life is like. Always thinking that your life has had not enough good things to over power the bad, is the impression the book gives"
2,tragic happenings to too many people,The first part of the novel made me like [or at least understand] the characters. Then the rest of the book involved one disaster after another. Half as many problems would have been more than enough. Very depressing.
2,Gloom and Doom in Ireland,"I read and loved Tara Road last year, so I was looking forward to another of Binchy's works. Unfortunately for me I chose this one. It started off fairly interesting, with the story of the Ryan family, and their quiet life in rural Ireland during 1962. Along comes Patrick O'Neill, a wealthy Irish American with great plans for a hotel in the area, where his family once lived. The impact of this man, his plans, and his family's interaction with the families of the town was a promising story. Yet one tragedy after another, with no happy end in sight just dragged this book down. Over six hundred pages long, it was ultimately a very unsatisfying read. I haven't given up on Binchy though, I have Circle of Friends and Scarlet Feather in my never ending To Be Read pile."
3,Lalique Illustrations,"As the author of the Essential Rene Lalique, I'd like to address the issue Mark Waller raised in his review at Amazon.com concerning the images used in the book. Abrams and its partner, Wonderland Press, chose not to use the list of images I submitted with my manuscript, and they also chose not to inform me of their selections. The first time I saw the illustrations was when they sent me a copy of the published book. I too share his frustration at this missed opportunity to present better material."
2,Harry Abrams what happened!,"A Book on the antiques field that proclaims on its back cover ""be an expert in 5 minutes"" (only), has a long way to go to impress me, it has to be said. However the author plainly knows his 20th century glass history and has done his homework on the man, but clearly does not know Lalique' s work or glass. The photos are the same old Christie image collection that might work for an auction catalogue but are dangerously out of context in the hands of an academic. The Images duplicate many of the cataloging errors of the worst type by a junior at Christies-one caption -Car ornaments, perfume bottles and an ink well.All in all I was sad that Harry N Abrams whose son was a client of mine, who once quoted his father as saying ""you should get a hernia taking one of my books off the shelf!"" Has, as a first step into a book on this great artist , chosen to produce this diminutive disappointment."
3,Good Presentation - Fair coverage of marijuana topics,This is an okay reference book. I found this book easier to navigate than Indoor marijuana Horticulture by Jorge Cervantes which is packed with information but not well presented. Between both of these guides I was able to improve on my cultivation techniques but there are gaps still not covered by both works. If you find yourself in this kind of a situation then I recommend that you look for normal botany books on growing. I have a collection of other readings which helped. You might have to go down that route too.Well worth the read but you will need much more than just these two books.
5,***PUBLISHER'S NOTE***,"This book is highly recommended for those wishing to study how marijuana cultivation has evolved throughout the years--from the technologies available at the time of publication, variations and adjustments to techniques over time, etc. Packed with valuable information, this edition will provide you with insight into the ways that scientific development, procedural modifications, and Ed's own contributions have shaped marijuana cultivation as we know it.For the most up-to-date information that takes advantage of the newest advances in horticulture, technology, and techniques, please check out our newest Deluxe edition, published June 2010. We've included fabulous, full-color eye candy of beautiful buds, helpful products, lush gardens--and even photos of what NOT to do. From germination to harvest, and everything in between, we've got you covered."
4,This book is great it helped me grow a great garden.,"At first I tried starting the plants myself but it didn't take me long to figure out I wasn't doing it right. So I went out and bought the most expensive book on how to grow it. The book is great now I have a beautiful luscious garden. Thanks EdStay High, Big Burner"
4,Ed is the man,I have been useing Ed's books for years. I follow his column in heads magazine and Cannabis Culture magazine. He knows what he is talking about. This book is the ultimate handbook. It tells you everything you need to know to get a garden started. I think this book is very easy to follow and is a great buy. Theinformation is priceless. I trust Ed and this book.
2,Not by any means a complete guide...,"I had very high expectations when I ordered this book, yet was disappointed. The book has good content, lots of info, but is vague about many points. VERY VAGUE, it's as if Ed wants you to buy more of his collection to get a COMPLETE guide to growing. I didn't pay $20 for a continuing series. The most disappointing point is that there are 50 (yes 50!) pages that are either blank or have irrelevant information; basically filler. Pretty decent, but only 2 stars."
2,Lotsa filler,I was very excited at first when i purchased this book. I was dissapointed when I started reading it. I wanted to know how to grow pot. I found it to be very thin when it came to explaining things. Way too much information in some chapters. I did however get some info from it and have a nice 3 footer growing in my closet. I used a ratio of 50 50 my own compost to a good potting soil something this book reccomends against. It's obvious some of the other reviewers did not read this book.
4,It's Cool for people who accept Kally as a Life Style,"The book is one of the bests with the clear chapters from seeding and lighting to harvesting levels. Also the pictures are so exciting, however, sometimes it's hard to understand some of the terms if English is not your native language but anyway it gives you great help. After i bought this book all the people around started to treat me like i'm a expert about the subject and i like it because, after you read this book you just realise how the people around you,who wants to grow their own pots, do it wrong..."
5,Flying Tiger Review,"One word AWESOME. This book is a wonderful read, full of great pictures and really depicts the era. Again, it is AWESOME."
4,Do the Job,I use it in conjunction with Boson Unix tests and was able to pass both exams on the first try!
4,Good but don't use it as your only source.,Update on my review (04/06/06)I passed today (04/06/06) the second part of the SCSA. I passed with a score of 75% (44/58). I use this book and the exam cram (Darell Ambro) to study for both exams. It worked out for me. I found the second exam harder than the first one.Review written on (02/22/06)This book is good for the certification exam. It covers most of the topic on the exam but I have found some serious mistakes in the book and in the practice exam. The book provides clear explanation of the objectives of the exam.As I always do I don't rely on one source for my exams. I used this along with the exam cram 2 and I was able to secure 85% (49/57)on my first exam (310-014).What I recommend if you don't have experience with Solaris 9 get it for free on the www.sun.com and familiarize yourself with it. It does help. Overall I recommend the book and use the Exam Cram 2 as supplement.
1,ZERO STARS! WHAT A SHOCKER! DON'T BUY!,"The author is a ""SCSA, MCSE, CNE, Server+, and A+"" but not degree-qualified. It shows in the writing. The book is full of absolute howlers and if you use this book YOU WILL FAIL THE EXAMS. ""A 9-year IT industry veteran"" - what a joke! This guy is fresh from writing M$ books! The book has ""flashcards for your PC"" - THIS IS UNIX GUYS and NOT WINDOWS!!"
5,EXTRORDINARY!!,"This CD of music by Ravel transcribed for 10 and 11 string guitar by the performer, Anders Miolin, is truly one of the must extraordinary gems in the guitar discography. Anders is able to get the widest range of colors I have ever heard on the guitar, and this fits Ravel's music perfectly. For example, listen to ""Laideronette, imperatrice des pagodas"" from ""Ma Mere I'Oye"" to hear sounds from the guitar that you wouldn't think were impossible to make, especially at the end of the piece. Anders has a grasp of this music like no one else. The ebb and flow of the music together with its constantly shifting colors will send you to a different state of mind and world. The instruments he plays are beautiful and the recorded sound is superb. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"
5,It is a great guide into the world of counter-intelligence.,The title intriqued me so I started reading. I found the information on elicitation techniques to be very helpful. Elicitation is something that can be used in every day life. I now know how to elicit more information at the next career conference I attend!!
4,The best book on elicitation and basic CI concepts,"John Nolan's book is to my knowledge the only book that explains the 12 elicitation techniques used in intelligence gathering and gives remotely-practical examples of each.While the examples may seem quirky, they are the closest thing to the unspoken truth about how real CI research gets done. His coverage of each technique is thorough yet clear, and the overall writing makes for a relatively smooth read.It is a must have for intelligence analysts and small business executives in cut-throat markets."
3,RN Appalled,"I am a Registered Nurse who works on the insurance side of the healthcare industry. I was appalled by some of the business intelligence practices described in Confidential. While many of the practices are not deemed illegal, ethical boundaries are definitely challenged. Admittedly, I do not care to engage in many of the techniques that were decribed. However, reading Confidential has enlightened me to the world of competitive intelligence, and has provided me with essential ingredients necessary to protect my own interest."
4,A nice surprise,"I bought this because I couldn't wait for the lp to be out to have more of South. A Place In Displacement isn't one of my favourite songs of theirs and I had only heard Supercede (which I liked quite a lot, it's really catchy) when I got this ep.And what a surprise! Fight Your Cause and Addiction To Fiction are two of the best songs they've made. Really beautiful stuff... Amazing. It's a shame they're not on the album (Adventures In The Underground Journey To The Stars)...I don't think the title track is anything special, but this ep's worth the money for those three great songs: Addiction To Fiction, Fight Your Cause and Supercede."
2,South going to play in the garage,"I really love these trio. After hearining they firs abum FROM HERE ON IN and the brilliant follow up WITH THE TIDES, and also all the singles. They always have componend extremly good tracks. But until today - these new single sounds like it was recorded in GARAGE, and played from a group that play wit each other for the first year!!! That's truth. South was going on!!! I don't wanna hear these tracks on a new album!!! Just compare a new UNKLE track (Leap of Faith) from a GOAL! sondtrack (Callbury (from SOUTH) sings on it) and these track from these singles. You hear the wall???Hope they work hard on new tracks for the furthcoming album...and forget about these realy bad single."
2,ZyXel WiFi Phone,"The phone works great from hotspots all overincluding internationally. The voice qualityis very good as long as there is good connectivityfrom the hotspot.But the phone has 2 major problems.1) The keypad keys don't work after the initial dialing.ie. You can't access your voicemail after dialing in.2) The battery life is very short.This is bleeding edge product that does work,but has a major design flaw."
2,ZyXel WiFi Phone,"This phone looks good and works well. It took me a while to get it on my wireless network at home. I had to upgrade the firmware on the phone to make it stable on the WiFi network. Once the phone was on the network, I was able to register it and use it to make and receive calls however, the voice quality was not good enough. I could hear fine when calling someone but he/she couldn't hear me well enough saying that my voice was low eventhough I was talking louder than usual. I recommend you look elsewhere for a WiFi phone. The only other descent choices on the market are UStarcom and the Linksys WIP300."
2,Not for use in a PBX,It does not support:1. Call Transfer2. Call on Hold3. Call Parking4. Checking voicemail
5,One Of The Best!!!!,"This is a positive review, as Nat ""King"" Cole is a legend that will go on until the end of time. This CD speaks for all of that and more!!!!!"
2,Definitely *not* the best awful.,"I slogged through almost 100 pages of this book before just giving up. I kept waiting for something to happen. Some movement, some dialog - SOMETHING. But it was just blah blah blah. Not even the wittiest blah blah blah. This is the third of Carrie Fisher's books that I have read and will definitely be the last.There is a limit to how much background I need on any given character and this book (at least as much as I could stand to read) went waaay beyond that. Was she getting paid by the word?"
1,Too bad the Audio CD is truncated.,I cannot really give an honest review of the book because the audio version is truncated. I received 5 CDs. The last track is very short and just stops in mid-sentence. Shame on the people that created the audio book.
1,Not Worth Reading,"After years of reading mostly non fiction, I finally had the time and inclination to get back to reading fiction. After enjoying all of the Jane Green, Gigi Levangie Grazer and Candice Bushnell novels, I tried this book... but try as I may, I was unable to read it. It just seems to be a series of ramblings and observations with no real story line. I liked Carrie Fisher in Star Wars and wanted to read about how her life was with a famous mother. She has a story to tell.... but should have let someone who is a good writer tell it for her. Luckily I just borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste money buying it."
4,Potty Mouth,"Very good book--well written. However, the language was terrible and excessive. It has dark humor--makes you laugh but feel the sadness of the story at the same time. The language may have fit the character, but I really got sick of hearing it. The book would have been just as powerful with less profanity.Carrie Fisher did a great job of narrating."
2,well written but hard to get through,"I was really looking forward to reading this book and am disappointed in it. I found the witticisms to be to hard to swallow and the writing seemed choppy. i couldn't get lost in this book because i kept having to re-read sections that i didn't even have an interest in because i found my thoughts drifting away.In the first chapter the narrator describes her ex husband's ability to work a room full of people with a mixture of metaphors and descriptions that i found dull and within the next few chapters, when the writing didn't recover, i gave up."
2,funny but scatterbrained,"The main character is bipolar, with a short attention span when manic. I felt this book was the same way. It is entertaining and with many colorful characters, Suzanne Vale (narrator and protagonist) is very witty and has a fantastic way with words. But the events in this book do not flow naturally, instead there seems to be one disconnected crisis after another, as if a stand-up comic ran out of material but kept going on and on until she filled 270 pages. Even the ending seems an unrealistic, forced resolution. But it does offer insights into bipolar disorder, celebrity life, and the realities of a mental institution. It is hilarious writing and has stretches (the last 100 pages) where excitement built up. But with Ms. Fisher's obvious talent, it could have been so much better."
3,here's what i didn't like...,"...the fact that the husband 'decides' he's no longer gay. this is an insult to all of us, regardless of sexual orientation. was it supposed to be a joke, a mockery of closeted men in show biz who decide it's just easier to be married to women? i don't think so - he had already come out. i was willing to forgive other flaws, but when i got to the end and read that one, i just thought, forget it. the carrie fisher of old wouldn't have made that choice as a writer. it's too bad, too, because i always admired her writer's voice and i counted on her to tell the truth. is it too late to bring back the old carrie? i truly hope not."
1,Just Awful,"Carrie Fisher's Best Awful is not a book that would ever be published if it were not for her fame. I am a big fan of hers as an actress, and I can certainly respect the need to write as a form of therapy for one's life, but this book is not well written. Mostly it is long lists of disconnected thoughts. At first I thought that she was trying to make the reader feel as if they were in a manic episode, and she succeeded at that, but as it continued throughout the 200 plus pages, it grew tiresome. I was in no way attached to the protagonist's problems, or the outcome. There were a few very funny things in the book, but all in all not worth the effort."
3,Not as Good as Her Previous Books,"I loved Postcards from the Edge and Delusions of Grandma, but for some reason, The Best Awful just struck me as trying too hard.I'm sure it's due to a ""write what you know"" issue, but I felt like it's SO close to what I know about Fisher that I couldn't get past thinking ""Is this something that happened to her in real life? Did her mother say that?"" I'm sure it's probably just me, but I just kept tripping over things that seemed too autobiographical to me.That being said, it is well-written, but while I couldn't put down her previous books and read them in a matter of days, this one has actually been sitting half-finished for over a month now."
3,"Started off good, lost wind at the end","""The Best Awful"" wasn't a horrible book, but it wasn't great either. The first 1/2 was fair. Carrie Fisher put just enough humor and interesting people in the mix to keep me interested in the story. 3/4 through the book, my interest started to wane. The story got less and less interesting. There was too much of Suzanne's thinking once she was in the mental hospital. I couldn't make it throught to the end. I had totally lost interest."
1,the awfulest awful!,This novel is a self indulgent rambling mess about a self indulgent rambling mess.
3,"Boy, oh, boy, this book!","Heartbreakingly honest at times, pretentious and facile at others, enjoyable and dear at times, achingly precious at others ... this book spans the spectrum. It's as unpredictable as the protagonist herself and the disease that afflicts her. I appreciated the unsparing account of her selfishness and guilts as she descended into madness and then bravely crawled back. But it felt more like a screenplay than a novel. It was almost as if Carrie was writing it with an eye toward the Lifetime made-for-TV movie. Still, I recommend it."
4,The best book in vision among those published until now,"I have been shocked three times after reading chapter one only of this book three years ago when I firstly contacted genius David Marr in my mind. It was because of i) his comprehensive understanding about human visual perception, ii) he was undoubtly young on the contrary to his comprehensiveness, and iii) regretfully he had gone young at his vital age. Until now, it is hard for me to deny his influences in directing my studies in vision. Don't say about vision before reading this book ! This is the best book in vision among those published until now at least in my sight."
5,"a very interesting perspective, explanation","This book is still relevant today, and provides the proper structure for understanding Visual Perception. I recommend this book to anyone interested in visual perception, this is an advanced undergrad or graduate level book that requires some familiarity with a number of diverse subjects including calculus, the anatomy and physiology of the human visual system, image processing, and image physics, but not on a deep level."
1,Still waiting ...,"I purchased this CD a while ago. It arrived earlier than expected so this was the first +. The cd-box was intact when it arrived, second +.When first listening to it the quality seemed very good. Third +.And then, during listening, the penultimate and the last track appeared to be damaged and produced only high distorted noise ... Double -So I contacted Amazon to complain about the faulty CD and on the 21st of September I received an email in wich they advised me to return it to the distributor.I returned the CD the 22nd of September.Since then I dindn't hear from them.So I'm still waiting ..."
3,ok.. some spoilers...,"Well i liked this story but i felt as i dont know anything at all about these characters..i have a few questions that keep nagging at me..If richard has always loved Leigh since she was a child why did he have her sign a Prenup supposedly hes been working all these years to win the business back for her? could someone answer that? Also i was a little dissapointed with the heroinne i understood her reasons but i didnt like that she hoped for a boy, after her childhood she shouldnt have cared about that, a child should be loved for itself not cause it could make life easire for a bunch of selfish women with no courage to live their lives cause thats why she wanted a boy for her sisters and mother. also is it just me or is the fact that the change in her family a little too little too late and a bit fake?? also i felt i didnt really know the hero what makes him tick, he was so in control it was scary..."
5,"Annie, just blow gently & steadily with the silver side up...","In response to the review below: I've been using one Master Key pitchpipe for decades with excellent results. In spite of the revolution of electronic, then digital, tuners, the good ol' Master Key is amazingly reliable for such a cheap, pocket-sized instrument. The one catch is: Yes, it does depend on how you play it. It is a small reed instrument, like a harmonica, and reeds bend if you over-blow them. The correct ""technique"" for this ""pitch instrument"" (that's what they call it) is to first inhale a deep breath, then blow into the selected pitch hole very evenly and gently out of the smallest opening one can get one's mouth to make, and it seems to sound better with the silver side up. May all your melodies be on key."
2,The notes change tone depending on how you blow.,The title says it all. The F in particular is quite inconsistent. I'm hoping that I can return this and find a better one.
5,Great product,"I am a big fan of this pitch pipe, I have used it on a regular basis. Very reliable and a great product"
3,It's okay....,"I don't know if it was dropped or something, but the sound is a little off for some of the pitches (mainly the lower register). Luckily, I don't sing very low so this doesn't affect my use of this product. Still, it bothers me that I paid for a product that was/is defected. Despite that, I really was happy that it shipped out fast."
2,I would not recommend this product.,"I bought this humidifier on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. It's easy enough to clean and handles hard water well. However, it is as loud as a box fan and it leaves a puddle underneath itself. In addition, filters for this model are somewhat hard to find. Most noticeable among this model's drawbacks is that it constantly flips on and off when you put it into automatic mode (""Accu-Stat""). My wife and I are going to return it and purchase a quieter, warm-mist humidifier with no filters to replace."
2,Poor performance,The filters of the highly recommanded Holmes (by the Consumer Reports)stopped absorbing water after about 4 weeks of use. The company claims that the filter (composed of 3 small filters) has to be replaced every 6 weeks. This is unacceptable and an expensive operation!
1,leaking water at the base,"Just bought this unit 3 days ago and was surprised to see pool of water under the base (very hazardous). Will return it and not really inclined to get the same brand as exchange.Accdg. to Environmental Protection, cool mist/impeller types of humidifier are worse (than steam/warm moisture) in terms of microorganism infection though there is no concrete study to support this."
1,Noisy and Leaks,I read several reviews on this including consumer reports trying to find a unit with a timer. I found this unit to be noisy and water leaked from the base all over the table and floor the first time I used it - I returned the unit and would not recommend this unit to others.
2,noise blower,I agree with one reviewer that the humidistat is regulated in a very tite range causing it to cycle on and off very frequently. I don't agree with the fan noise. I found it to be very noisy compaired to the two Bemis humisifiers I had for the past two years. I admit they don't have the air ionizer and other features but at least I can forget they are there. Oh and the wick is hard to find.
3,M.A.D.E. (The Real Coming Of Age),"""Memphis Bleek's"" third album was released just a month or so after ""Jay-Z's"" final album. Nothing major has changed with Bleek's rhyming style and he hasn't really improved much with his lyrical skills. On the positive side, this album does contain enough material to keep you interested, whether it's the blazing production work or his own trial and tribulation stories, this has to ""Memphis Bleek's"" most interesting album to date. Even though it doesn't live up to his mentor's ""Black Album"" LP, it still has enough to keep your attention going."
2,2.5 Stars,"Memphis Bleek is NOT the future of Roc-A-Fella. Jay-Z should not put too much time into Memphis Bleek because he is a veteran and still he can't make a decent album. Some appearences from Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel are worth listening to, but this album is NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,i love u bleek but not your best?!,"soooooo, yea i like to call myself the wife of bleek or lady bleek to most people . i belive made was a great cd but not as good as the understanding which to me deserved 20+ mics,As jayz protege' i think he did GOOD on this album but couldve did better.i dont respect any one who trys to diss bleek but bleek please step ur game up and stop letting them create these silly rumors about u getting robbed an not being able to go to marcy anymore personally i from nyc and i kno alot so stop it .its not good for your publicity.....this album 3/5 but in adition go get the understanding believe me youll understand him better."
3,Bleek drops one for the cars...,"This album just like the other Memphis Bleek ones lacks the basics. It is a great album for ridin in the car with you friends or whatever but it still is a sucky album for just listenin to at home. Bleek has talent but has still not found out how to use it fully. But for $10.99, its worth the cost i think."
2,Bleek future!,"If it wasn't for tracks like ""Just Blaze, Bleek and Free"", ""Ballin'"" and ""Understand Me Still"", this album would be total flop, not even worthy of a one star rating. After all this time with Jay-Z, Bleek should have learned a lot from his mentor. His music comes across as shallow and lackin street credibility and good beats. Horrible piece of work!"
1,Flop,this albums a complete flop there are few good songs on this album and the only reason there a few instead of none i thanks to artists like freeway & rell with out them this album would just be plain CRAP
1,M.A.D.E._G.A.R.B.A.G.E.,"I realy do not like any roca-fella arist and i think beane seagel along with young gunnaz,freeway, are all pretty much wack and all their beats aren't tight at all. Now, you may think Memphis [...] may be better, right ? Wrong. All his albums inclunding his debut are all mediocre and even tho just blaze produce diz crap ? It's didnt save it at all. The most boring song to me in here is ""hypnotic"" what the [...] were diz homos thinking, when dey made diz song?Also just blaze is another horrible track and embarresment to rap, period. Do not by any chance waste you money on memphis bleek's "" Made"" coz it ain't worth nuthin. Peace!"
4,bleek is....,"just blaze really brought out the heat when it comes to production. its a solid album. i like the growth of more personal topics such as understand me still, and that other songs. if he gets the marketing push and radio embraces him he can definitely go platinum, its worth coppin if ur a fan of the roc. hopefully he'll get the sales he deserves wit this solid album"
5,SCREW THIS GET THE KANYE WEST,"Man That whole kanye west cd is banging. I havent heard a cd so real in a long ass time, every song is actually saying something and has a message in it. I really didnt think i would like his music but this Dood is the next jay-z or on that level. GET THE KAYNE WEST."
4,GO GET THIS ALBUM!!!,"This is hands down, Bleeks best album. With the help of Roc-A-Fella producer Just Blaze, this album is hot. Just Blaze produced most of the tracks and almost all of the beats are very good. Lyrically, Bleek has improved greatly. My favorite tracks are track 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, forget it....I love the whole album. This album is a must for all Roc-A-Fella and hip hop fans."
2,M.A.D.E,"I guess you can call made memphis bleek's best album out of his other 2. That should be a complement but it really isnt, his other 2 albums were pretty much a disappointment, and this album cannot compare with jay-z's new realease the Black Album. There are a few good tracks im not saying this album is horrible but it still isnt bleek's potenial. I have kinda lost faith in bleek after 3 albums that didnt live up to the hype. This album shoul really get around 2.5 stars but for not living up to the standards of the black album I will gibe it a 2."
3,Memphis Bleek: M.A.D.E.,"M.A.D.E can be viewed as a positive step forward...a small one. Though the beats are incredible, Just Blaze and others cannot save the album from failure. Memphis Bleek extends the normal, unchanged flow which has been the same since The Understanding. His lyrics fall under the ""average"" category, as he slides by with clever hooks yet weak verses. Unfortuneatly, Bleek is often outdone by guest appearences such as Trick Daddy on ""Round Here,"" and Proof on ""We Ballin."" With Jay stepping down, hopefull Bleek will mature quickly...it's a large spot to be filled."
3,A Bit Too Commercial?,"When I heard the musical clips from this CD, I bought it, expecting it to be hardcore. It's not. If you like him or this genre, you will probably like it. I did not like it because, honestly, I was looking for hardcore, expletive riddled, nasty stuff. This is not it."
5,M.A.D.E,The album is absolutely brilliant Memphis bleek is so underrated the production on this album is also off da hook.
3,time well tell,"I had read a few things on different M/C forums about this E3 plug, thought I would try a pair. Fit and finish is OK, very similar to splitfires, made in China. I'll know more after 10k miles, but I think it's snake oil."
5,great read,"I didn`t know this was a series of books based on 1 person,not that it matters you can start anywhere as I started on this one which is the 5th.I will go back and read the others.This is a real page turner,very well written and really keeps you interested."
4,a good read,"This book doesn't follow the usual paths of detective fiction. At first, the reader isn't even sure what type of case it will be, burt in the end it all fits together in an exciting and difficult to guess manne"
2,It formed rust right away.,"I followed the instructions:Boil water with some potato peels in it for 15 minutes; wipe clean, dry, and put 1 cm oil and heat for 5 min. Discard oil, and wipe clean. That's the instruction.After boiling the water, I wiped it clean right away. I saw 2 inch long rust belt on the exterior and a good 8 inch long rust in the interior of the pan. I have cast iron pans and carbon steel pans. This is not my first time in seasoning those guys. I have paderno series and matfer series, I did not have such a problem with them.So, What's that? Just a defective item or maybe it is from a defective batch. Who knows.FYI: I also oredered Debuyer Mineral B pans. Their seasoning does not involve any water boiling, and beesewax protective coating comes out right away. For seasoning purposes only, I would go with their Mineral B series versus Carbon Plus series. As for performance, I have not used them yet."
5,Amazing reading!,"I got this book as a surprise and was it ever! It sounds like such a simple concept. If you could relive three weeks of your life, any three weeks, which would you choose, if any, and how would it change your life? I'm sure I'm not the only reader who pondered this dilemma after finishing this fine book. Jude Deveraux has a wonderful way with words, and it made me want to finish it in one sitting. I think books that make you think while you are reading them and also when you're done are not that easy to come by and I was really pleased with every page."
1,Dreadful,"Maybe it was because I just finished reading books by Wally Lamb, Rosemarie Pilcher, and Pat Conroy, but his was awful. The midnight ride on horseback was too much! Can anyone really imagine getting together with two other women that you spent an hour with getting your license at 21, then hooking up 20 years later and spilling your guts about such personal matters? Are all her books this contrived? If so, hand me the pen, I've got some money to make."
3,Good Beach Book,"This is the first Jude Deveraux book I have read. I found the story line a little hard to believe. I mean, if you had just met two other people at the DMV, would you go spend a week-end with them 19 years later? Getting past that, it was a fast read with an interesting twist, but a little too quick to tie up the loose ends. I am glad I got this at the library and did not buy it. It is not a book that I would read again."
2,Would someone please teach her how to write?!,"I don't usually read books of this genre, but I liked the premise of having an opportunity to go back to an earlier time, to redo a past mistake(s). And the author had received many favorable reviews. But the book was a disappointment. The writing was stilted and awkward - her words and sentences were without beauty or grace. Similarly, there was no subtlety in the way she discussed her characters. Everything was spelled out bluntly, as if she doesn't expect her readers to be bright enough to read between the lines. I will not be reading any of her other work."
1,"After ""Temptation"" - could it get any worse?","I am truly amazed. My favorite author has written another book that is totally off-beat. Where is she getting these story lines? Where is she getting these characters? After reading her last book, ""Temptation"", I assumed it couldn't get any worse. I was proven wrong. I don't know how anyone who has written so many wonderful stories can lose their talent so quickly. This book was published because of the name of the author, not the written material. If a book like this was submitted for publication by an unknown, it wouldn't make it beyond the first few paragraphs, before being ""returned to sender"". I have learned my lesson. After two in a row, I'm moving on. Better yet, I'll just go back and read all her GOOD books for a third time to remind myself why she was the best for many years."
3,No sex :(,"The book was okay. Three womens' stories intertwined into one, full of regrets and misfortunes, and then a chance to change it all. Not a lot of romance and certainly no sex. Once again, as always with Jude Deveraux, when there is time travel involved, the explanation is lame. Jude is not a sci-fi writer and should stop trying. She can make you wholeheartedly believe two people can't live without one another and are even soul mates, but she's never even entertained me in a time travel story, let alone made it believable (in a way that any fiction is ""believable"").Good for wasting time. Not much else."
4,How to change the past....,This was a fantasy read but by the time I was half way through I could not put it down. I HAD to know what happened! 3 women who met in New york on their 21st birthdays meet again 19 years later. All of them have some regrets and NOT-SO-MUCH by chance they get to go back in time to see if they want to change the paths of their lives.2 of the three do but they all benefit from the experience. The only disappointment was the very end...a little flat to me. And the fact that I wanted to be able to do what they did and I can't!! Oh - to be 21 again knowing th things I know now! Jeanette
4,Too Condensed,"Let me start out by saying this is a must read. It is light, easy and fun. It is not meant to be believable!! That is why they call it fiction! My only complaint is that Jude condensed 3 stories into one book. Although it keeps the action going, I feel too much of each character was overlooked. I loved all 3 main characters and would have liked each of their stories told in full. All in all, though, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys escaping into a book."
4,The Summerhouse,"The Summerhouse was a decent book. I have recommended it to my friends. It was, however, redundant and overly descriptive at times. The premise is great, but I think too much of the book was spent on the characters' past lives--or maybe too little time on the characters' current lives. She glossed over the most important part of the book. The murder part was extraneous. It really didn't fit into the plot. Overall, I would recommend the book to romance lovers. As with all of JD books,the characters are heartwarming and interesting, and she makes for light reading."
4,two roads diverged,"Frost's poem could be the book blurb for this novel.If you had two paths you could take in life, which would you choose.Madison, Ellie, and Leslie get the chance to walk another path.The three female leads are wonderful, believable characters.I love their journey and the introspective thought processes they go through. You will end up rooting for their path to lead to happiness.Deveraux deftly juggles all three characters through the bookwith a smooth seamless style.I very much enjoyed the contrasts of youth and age that Leslie, Madison and Ellie go through. It is easy to step into the book with themand imagine yourself having the chance to fix some of thehurtful things life has hurled at you.A teensy slow getting started, but it quickly picks up momentumand flows briskly to a smile enducing, satisfying conclusion.This was my first Jude Deveraux novel. It absopositootley makes me want to pick up another of her stories."
4,Too short,"I read the book in a day -- it was a great escape book. The going-back-and-changing-your-mistakes has been done before but it was a fresh approach. I only have two gripes: #1. The actual ""going back"" part was extremely choppy. Ms. Devereaux could have easily added another 100 pages to round out this section at the end. #2. Why, if these three women became such fast & good friends at their first meeting, did it take 19 years for any of them to make contact again. Couldn't help but wonder if, had they truly been friends, many of their ""mistakes"" would not have been made in the first place. All in all I would recommend the book. I think every woman will find bits of herself in one or more of the characters. It just should have been longer."
4,"Fun, Fast, great summer read!","I liked this book because it started out the standard ""friend story"". You know the one, friends meet years down the road, talk about their loves and loss, all over a couple of martinis and chocolate. What is unique about this book is that the three friends here get to travel back in time and change things. Fanciful and light reading yes, but sometimes you need just that! The stories are engaging and the ending will make you smile. It just might get you thinking ""What If""?? Take it to the beach and relax..."
4,"A beach read, fun and supernatural","This is my first Jude Devereaux book and I enjoyed it. The premise of the story is three women who met at 19 at the DMV get together as they turn 40 to look back at their lives. It takes a supernatural turn when an opportunity arises for these ladies to go back in time to live three weeks over again. All three women chose a time important to them, a turning point in their mind, where their lives could have gone one way or another.I enjoyed this read. It was not a deep enduring story, but it was unique and a fun way to pass the time. Sometimes Devereaux's story is a bit too perfect, but it is a romance after all.Overall, a good story to take you away. Although, it may make you look at your life and decide where in time you would like to return to and daydream about the road not taken."
4,The Summerhouse,"Leslie, Ellie and Madison are all aging former beauties that know eachother by only one chance encounter 19 years ago. When Ellie gets the chance to invite them to spend thier 40th birthday together, all three meet in a quaint Maine town. They see that life has been kind to none of the girls. Suddenly they get a chance to ""rewrite"" thier past, but do they right all that is wrong? This book is a wonderful exploration of the ""what might have been's"" that most people undoubtedly go though. All though sacchrine sweet at times, biting sarcastic dialouge will holds the non-romantic personality captive."
3,"Not the best of Deveraux, but still readable","The story was very enticing and entertaining up until maybe the last quarter of the book. It seemed like Ms. Deveraux was on some kind of deadline and just threw the ending together as fast as she could. It was somewhat disappointing. I wish she could've gone into more detail with the aftermath of the past relived and decisions were made.However, I do recommend the book if you want a quick read. A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR is still my all time favorite! hehe"
3,Good until the end,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. However the ending was anti-climactic. This great buildup then the ending falls short. Oh well, I guess. The premise is good, the characters are interesting, and the idea of being able to go back in time for 3 weeks is certainly something everyone can relate to, but the ending kind of ruins it."
4,"wonderful, but something missing",I thought J.D. book was very well written although i felt that there was something missing in all of it. It was a quick read that was brought right to my attention. Can't wait to read more of this Author's books!
1,Help!!,"I'm in a downward spiral and cannot stop collecting Deveraux novels. I need to stop. She just simply has lost touch with me, her greatest fan. Please bring back the days of Knight in Shining Armor and The Black Lyon. The Summerhouse is yet another installment of her ""I really am tired of this writing thing, but I have a contract!"" saga. I've had enough of the time-travel. It worked a couple of times, but it's time to just let it go! Bring back the Montgomery MEN!!! Gone are the days when I darted to the romance section to see if there was a new Deveraux about. Gone are the days when I finished a Deveraux in a day. They're just too hokey and uninteresting and way too materialistic. Bring on the HISTORICALS. Whisk ME away to another time. That's what I used to love about Deveraux and I hope to have that love in my life again."
2,From Bad to Worse,"I found the first few chapters to be cheesy and contrived. And then it got worse. The author first started losing me with the ice cream/""Ira's Girls"" bit -- just not a credible event. My alarm went off, but I (unfortunately) kept reading. Eventually, the book turned into a completely unsuccessful attempt to blend unbelievable and unimaginative reality with hokie fantasy. All in all, an absurd story and an awkward and frustrating read."
1,INSULTED INTELLIGENCE,"I was sucked into reading this book because it was supposed to be a grand departure from the author's typical fairy tale dribble. I give almost any author a second chance--but this time I'm sorry to have wasted my time. I did finish it, but it wasn't easy. The three women in this story have made stupid decisions which have adversly affected their lives. Instead of taking charge and changing their lives for the better, they seem to be basking in their own unhappiness. One is too fat (oh my), another is too thin (oh dear), and the other hasn't developed any interests of her own (what tragedy)! Upon reuniting with one another, they have an encounter with an orange-wigged psychic who provides them with an opportunity to go back and alter their pasts. I think the idea of female freinds re-visiting their pasts is wonderful, but this rendition is like a sibling of Disney's ""Freaky Friday"" (pretty cute, but too dumb to take seriously)."
2,ugh.,"This book was the monthly choice from a member of my book club; therefore, I was somewhat forced into it. Though I do occasionally encounter a book club choice that I would never have picked but end up thoroughly enjoying, this was not the case for Summerhouse. The plot is somewhat upsurd, but I would have been willing to accept that if the characters were believable and a little less insulting. This book is one big cliche (Leslie's husband is cheating on her with a secretary named Bambi! No, really). The female characters are shamefully pathetic and needy, and the circumstances surrounding their original meeting are just plain goofy. Don't even get me started on the dialogue--completely unbelievable. The only reason I gave this read two stars instead of one is because, amidst all of the incredulous elements, I was somehow compelled to find out how low the book would go. It's redeeming quality is the guilty indulgence you will feel upon completing it."
5,the dreams and the chances,"the summerhouse was the most envigerating book i have read in a long time. most books now are about some mystery or FBI case but this was so different yet so great you just cant put down this book untill you finish and then you want more. it took me 3 whole days to finish this book and i took it with me everywhere (the kitchen, bathroom, subway, work, bed etc...) and i just loved it i recomend this to anyone and everyone I gurantee that no matter what you will love this book."
2,Women being victimized...by themselves,"Although I tried, I just couldn't finish this book. For the same reasons I can't tolerate watching movies where women are vicitimized, I couldn't tolerate this book. It certainly started interestingly enough, but quickly deteriorated into three long, overly dramatic tales of women who allowed the men in their lives to walk all over them, time and time again. Perhaps the author was trying to elicite the reader's sympathy for these characters...instead I just wanted to scream at them to get a life.Please, Ms. Deveraux, although some women are forced to endure sub-standard treatment at the hands of their lovers, it's a bit tough to believe that these THREE such gifted women would ALL have had their lives ruined by men and been unable to, just a little, pull themselves out of their despair. Give women more credit, and give men a break. You must have characterized the most dysfunctional members of each gender in this book."
5,Wonderful reading experience,This is a must read if you like the style of Jude Devereaux. Keeps you entertained from the first chapter till the end. What's best is she has done a follow on book!
5,Awesome,This was a truley awesome book. I really enjoyed reading it. I am a mother of two young children and I found myself sneaking around just to read an additional page when ever I could get away! A must read!MB
2,good story but lacking in balance,"It's tough going through the first two thirds of this book, which contains 3 women's tales of woe. Just as it gets interesting in the last section---where they each have the chance to go back for 3 weeks and do it all over again---the book is done. As a copyeditor, I'd say Deveraux's editor was asleep at the wheel this time. Buy it for fun, but don't expect a whole lot."
1,pass on this one,"I was looking for a great beach book and unfortunately chose this one. It is poorly written which is ironic since the main character was a writer. The plot was silly at best. If most reviewers felt it was the best book they have read in a long time I hate to think what other books they have been reading. I will not read other books by this author. If you are debating on this one, take a pass and move on to something else."
5,Second Chances,"Every time I read this book it makes me think of possibilities and what I would do differently with my life if I could go back in time, knowing what I know now. Oh, just for a while to say, ""what if"" It's a nice escape read. The characters are fun and relatable as well."
3,Unbelievable but fun read.,"Events in the book are totally unrealistic...how many of your friends have unlimited funds to buy you a new wardrobe, hire a personal trainer, get a doctor to cure your OCD or fly you to CA to live for a few months. However, if you can get past the outrageousness of those events, the book is a fun read. Nice escape from daily life."
5,The Summerhouse,"The book was a great summer beach read. Be sure to read her next one ""Retun to Summerhouse"". It was also a great easy read."
3,Beach Read Fairy Tale,"The Summerhouse is a very light, easy read that reminded me of a modern day fairy tale. Three women Ellie, Madison & Leslie are, at age 40, pained and bitter about life. As they meet again for the first time since they were 21 they get a mystical chance to see what their life would have been like had they chosen different paths. This novel takes an interesting look at the ""what if's"" in life and how the choices we make in life so deeply affect us. It is not realistic, but I don't think it's supposed to be-but rather a creative way to explore the road not taken. The novel isn't too deep and the writing is light, but the subject is intriguing."
5,The Summerhouse is TERRIFIC!!,"I first purchased the 2nd book in this series to learn that it was, in fact, the 2nd book. So, before reading it I searched for and purchased the FIRST book (The Summerhouse) at Amazon. It was a great experience, not only the price and shipping were perfect, so was the book! Each character in the story is well presented and believable and the story line was such that it was difficult for me to find stopping point! I loved it and highly recommend it (as well as the sequel, ""Return to the Summerhouse"")."
1,Best Seller? Unbelievable!!,"I'm a person who finishes almost any book I start, meaning I'm pretty careful about choosing one. ""National Best Seller"" at one time meant a book was worth taking a risk on. However, I labored through a third of this book until I just couldn't take it anymore. As a retired teacher, I'd give this author a failing grade if this were turned in as a creative writing effort. For starters, to think that workers in a DMV office would retain beautiful women just to look at them is as preposterous as the chances that these three strangers would share exactly the same birthdate! ...And in one short meeting they forged a friendship that caused them to reunite nearly twenty years later? This silly story goes downhill from there. Does anyone actually edit this stuff these days? This one I'm not even recycling; it's going into the garbage can."
1,Definately Skip This One!,This was my first and last Jude Deveraux book! I was looking for some light summer reading but this is ridiculous. How could anyone believe such a nonsense story of three women (of course they all had to be absolutely gorgeous) meeting at the DMV once 20 years ago and agreeing to meet up again on their 40th birthdays?! Jude Deveraux does not know how to write and anyone who reads her novels is insulting his or her intelligence in my opinion. The story and characters were totally unbelievable and I found myself embarrassed to be reading such worthless [material]. Never again will I waste [money] on such garbage. If this is the kind of book that makes it into America's top ten bestsellers list we should all be ashamed of how low we have sunk. I am all for a light read but I cannot stand a writer who does not even know how to write! How on earth did she become one of the country's leading authors?! It baffles me.
1,Too many characters; dumb book,"I'm glad it wasn't just me; I just didn't like this book so I came to Amazon to find out w hat others thought; apparently I'm not alone. I couldn't keep track of the characters (Which is the pretty one, which is the writer? and which guy goes with whom?) and I too felt that meeting 20 years later after a chance meeting at the DMV was highly unlikely. But then so is time travel. Actually I like good time travel stories but this was just not good. First Jude Devereaux book I've read - may be the last. There's a lot of good stuff out there..."
1,The slowest moving book I've ever read.,"I could not get into this book. I love Jude's books and have read almost all of them. The Summerhouse was one of the slowest moving books I have ever read. Seriously, the book should have been about one woman and not all three. The character development was so shallow and I just couldn't get into it. After the first 100 pages or so, I quit reading."
3,"good story, but too short","I think this is one of the weaker books that Jude Deveraux has written in recent years. The plot itself is interesting. What would you do if you were given a chance change your life after re-living 3 weeks of it? Would you choose the new life and forget the old one, choose it but remember the old life, or stay with your old life?Unfortunately, the book was too short and sometimes too melodramatic. I wished it were longer. It's simply too short to cover 3 women's life, spanding 19+ years. Other reviewers have said this. She spent 2/3 of the book recounting (very quickly) their present life. And the last 1/3 on how they choose to change their past. Some of their stories were just too tragic and you felt she was exaggerating in order to get the contrast of before and after across.In any case, still a good book since Deveraux always writes well. But definitely could have been better."
1,Eddie Arnold would roll over in his grave,"If he could hear this CD. This is the absolute worst version of Cattle Call that I have ever heard. It's a blend of Sound of Music and Sons of the Pioneers. The Tennessee Stud sound quality is pitiful. The vocals are muted, when you turn up the volume to hear it, the next track comes on so loud it blasts your ears. I love Eddie Arnold's music - just this CD is a poor choice."
2,Dissapointing and not very helpful,"As a budding atmospheric physicist (entering graduate school this fall) holding a B.S. in mathematics and possessing decent knowledge in physics and chemistry, I was extremely disappointed when I bought this book for self study. Andrews summarily exposes the important topics, with most of them lacking in breadth, depth, clarity, and physical insight. Additionally, the tone is rather dispassionate. Fortunately I stumbled on 'Fundamentals of atmospheric physics' by Murry Salby, and find it a superior, lucid read. I'd highly recommend going for that instead."
4,"great single, okay b-sides","The title track single 'Boy With A Coin'(track 2) is full of energy and nicely syncopated handclap beats and should prove to be a great precursor to his upcoming album, ""The Shepherd's Dog"". 'Carried Home' (track 1) is a very different sound than we're used to from Sam Beam, with an electric keyboard and other synthesized sounds. 'Kingdom of the Animals' (track 3) has a nice piano track to it and some beautifully whimsical vocals and lyrics.The first and third tracks were possibly residual detritus that fell from the recording sessions, but they do seem to indicate Beam's constant efforts to play with his sound and develop as a musician. All in all, if you're a big Iron and Wine fan who cannot wait for this fall's full length album, you will not hesitate to get this single. This man is a true poet and bard."
4,Good EP,"So this is the first thing we've heard from Same Beam since the Women King EP (well for solo material anyway). I really liked Boy with a coin, and especially Kingdom of the Animals, which I think, in my humble opinion, would have been the single. Although Boy with a coin is a good song, it gets a tad repetitive after a few listens. Kingdom is a great track with a really fleshed out structure and lots of layers. I didn't really care for the first track, but the 2 others a good enough for a 4 stars review."
5,Fantastic!!,"This is a more rich sound for Sam Beam, but it works so well that I can't wait for the new full length."
1,I know you won't be posting this,"This is ironic and cruel in a way. I've been waiting on this item to be delivered even though it was ordered on December 30, 2006, yet you found it funny to send me a request to review the item. The delivery estimate I was given (February 12) is 6 weeks from the time of order even though on the item page it says 3-5 weeks. I do need this item for class, but luckily it was not the first book on the agenda. So don't post this as I am reviewing you rather than the item because I know nothing of the quality of the latter. Thank you."
5,Kodansha's highly recommended,"This dictionary is most excelent for intermediate students of japanese, that knows hiragana and katakana. Enjoy it!"
3,full of mistakes,This book contains many typos and outright mistakes. I don't remember there being so many in the old Kodansha romaji dictionaries.My advice is to buy the old dictionaries and wait until a new edition of this comes out.
5,Excellent for beginners,"For those people who really want to learn Japanese and have a beginner level, this dictionary is a good acquisition.It has the needed words for a beginner student with very useful examples and contains the furigana system which helps to introduce kanji in a great way."
3,Extremely complex,"I spent 2008 in Japan and this is one of the books the company reimbursed me for. It was quite a bit above my head despite my former training in Japanese. You should have a sound base in Hirigana and Katakana and realize that this is an advanced reference work, not a teaching book."
3,"Good for beginners, frustrating for more advanced users.","This book is no doubt an excellent dictionary for beginning or intermediate students of Japanese; it provides good examples of usage for most entries.BUT BE WARNED: Don't buy it if you're looking for depth or difficult/advanced words. This dictionary is basically a pocket dictionary with frills; in fact, my tiny Random House pocket dictionary has words that this book doesn't. Anyone with a few years of study completed will be far better served by a more comprehensive dictionary that doesn't waste space with examples of usage."
3,"Great, but terrible","I was rather disappointed with this book for how much it costs.All entries are VERY detailed, giving great care to example sentences and explanations. I like the kana order, and the furigana. I love the binding, you won't find a more durable book than this no matter how hard you look.The problem is, it has a VERY limited amount of entries.. Anything other than the very basic of the basic words, you will NOT find in this dictionary. My random house dictionary that I purchased when I first started learning Japanese has far more entries, and is about a quarter of the price."
2,decent until you learn a few words,"I thought this was a halfway decent dictionary when I first got it. I had just started learning, and I didn't need much. I was more worried about having a dictionary than I was about what was in it. Looking back, I have to say that it really wasn't useful for long. I soon found myself looking in other dictionaries because this one simply did not have what I needed.This all happened while I was studying Japanese on my own. I have since taken two semesters of Japanese in school. I find that opening this dictionary is a waste of time, and I suspect I would have found it just as useless at this point if I had taken Japanese without studying on my own beforehand.My overall impression is that this would be a good dictionary for someone who has just barely started learning Japanese, or has no real intention of learning the language. Anyone else will find it woefully inadequate."
2,Not worth it.,"This dictionary sux. Frustratingly few entries, even lacking a lot of basic vocabulary, really rather useless. You'll outgrow it very quickly. On top of that, the dictionary is rather bulky when compared to what's actually in it. My suggestion: spend a few more dollars and get a better dictionary."
5,THis thing is AWSOME!,"This ""Furigana"" dictionary, as said in the publishers note, ""reflects the latest rationale and methodology...emphasized on the importance of mastering the two kana scripts (Hiragana and Katakana)from the outset of their (the students) studies."" This dictionary is void of All romaji (roman text form of Japanese language), and only contains direct English to Katakana/Hiragana. This is greatly beneficial to those wanting to become fluent in Japanese written and spoken language, as to not be handicapped by romaji as a fall-back.Beside that, This book is made of amazing quality. Measuring in at only 7 7/16"" tall and 5 3/4"" wide, it weights almost 3.5 lbs. That alone is testimate to the high quality paper and binding used. Though the book is small in dimension, it does not take away from the ability to clearly see the text. Needless to say, When this Jisho (dictionary) arrived, I was thoroughly pleased."
4,Fine dictionary,"This is a good dictionary for beginners and intermediate students. However, the focus on furigana may not be such a good thing - there is the risk of relying on them as a crutch instead of learning kanji properly as furigana use is actually relatively uncommon in Japanese texts meant for adult readers. So if one can avoid becoming ""dependent"" on furigana, then this is a good dictionary. It would probably be pretty useless to advanced learners of the lanugage. Again, taking the time to memorize kanji readings instead of relying on furigana will save you a lot of time spent on looking them up when you are trying to read a text that does not incude any or all furigana.Ivan Rorick"
5,A Complete Furigana Dictionary,"I recently purchase this dictionary, and to be honest it is a great help, it has the furigana characters and also the kanji version of the same word, plus of course a well detailed meaning in both japanese and english, it is absolutely a wonderful dictionary, I was really pleased with the purchase"
4,"""Russian Roulette II""","This album is logical sequel from very beginning of UDO's solo career. In fact, this got to be called Accept II or Russian Roulette II. UDO made a lot of good songs and if you pick any of his solo projects you will not definitely be disappointed.He picked different musicians, including Rudy Graf and Peter Szigeti both from ex. Warlock (I still longing for this band) and wrapped them in Accept sound (completely bingo). This is a very good album, although it is not UDO's the best album. Classic tunes are Animal House, They Want War, Go Back To Hell, They Want Loud, Warrior etc, etc. Highly recommended for those who enjoy in classic heavy sound."
5,accept is back--sort of.,"i used to be a heavy listener of accept back in the late 80's-early 90's. with udo, accept is not dead. the spirit of accept is carried forward by the lead singer, udo dirkschneider"
4,"Heavy, Hard Hittin' Dick Dale","Everyone know's Dick Dale is the 'Big-Daddy' of original instrumental surf music, and for awhile there, he hadn't recorded any new music for some time, but in the last 20 years, he's come back with some really hot, almost touch of metal, hard-hittin' new & old surf music. I like this album, not every song is great, but there are some solid surf-rockers on here. Some of the best are: ""Scalped"", ""F Groove"", ""Take It Or Leave It"", ""California Sun"", ""Hava Nagila"", & ""Unknown Territory"". If your an ole' Dick Dale & instrumental surf fan, you'll like his later material alot!"
5,Fantastic videos,I thought these videos were fantastic. I'm not disappointed in purchasing Backstreet Boys - Never Gone: The Videos. I love collecting videos of the boys.
3,Okay but very short....,The content that was on it was good but it wasn't very long. They should have added some live performances or more interviews.
3,Backstreet Boys - Never Gone: The Videos,They are of good quality but they have only 3 music videos while others are of makin and all that. So I'll rank it neutrally.
1,rip off,"It is made to sound as if you get all the film clips from the never gone cd, but in fact you only get three and the making of those! I would not have purchased this if I had of known. It's very misleading!"
2,no smell sratch & Sniff,"This is a very cute book I bought for my daughter, who LOVES scratch & sniff books. It is bright and colorful and based on the board game Candy Land. The down side is that after about a month, the smelly spots, which were very strong smelling faded away, and now less than 6 months of after purchasing the book, we have a non-smelly scratch and sniff book. Wish I had read the reviews, I would have saved my money. Those DK scratch and sniff books are fantastic, the smell has lasted forever. Buy those instead of this book, you'll be happier in the end."
2,Scratch and Sniff areas do not last long,"My children love scratch and sniff books so we have all that I have been able to find.This book is simple and cute, but the odor areas do not last long at all. After about 3 months the book stopped smelling like anything."
2,not so scratch and sniff,"The presentation of the book is very similar to the board game with King Candy as the host. It didn't have the number of pages I expected. It is the typical box shaped hard cardboard type book. The pages are very, very bright. Myself and my 5 year old scratched out the smells completely after only a few uses. I expected the smells to last much longer than that."
2,The Barbecue Bible,"Nice recipes, but many are complicated; many ingredients are unique and therefore difficult to find. A better name for the book would be ""The Barbecue Gourmet."""
3,barbeque bible,"I have purchased many used books before, so I do understand what ""used"" means...but this book was in terrible condition. The pages are readable, but the book looks like it went through a flood. It is twice the width of a regular book due to water damage. Not real happy about what was written about the the quality of book, for the price."
1,"I wasn't impressed, the book totally misses the point. Bible??? I think not! Where's the meat?","Where this book fails immediately is that Barbecue is not about the sauce it's about the meat. I know, I design sauces and own a BBQ Sauce Company. I'm always looking for good BBQ cookbooks. The author gives no information on preparation of meat or cooking it. He spent 13 pages on how to light different grills and I wasn't impressed much with that. I think the big headlines were used to waste space so that he could put out a big book. I could go on but here is one final thought. The book claims to be the Barbecue Bible, you'd expect it to cover the subject in every detail and with some degree of experience. This attempt at being the Barbecue Bible fails miserably. I bought the book online, if I saw the book in a book store and was able to go through it, I would not have bought it. Steven Raichlen is probably a food critic or cookbook editor, not a barbecue expert."
2,The Barbecue..Bible????,"Ok, Perhaps the recipes are great, but unlike his other books with great illustrations, I might have just picked up a world dictionary that doesn't entise the imagination. Again, the recipes are most likely wonderful, but when it comes to cookbooks, I prefer ones that are visual and tantilizes all my sences when reviewing a meal."
3,Gotta love BBQ..,This book covers a lot of basic topics in detail. If you have never seen a BBQ or are trying to fill some big holes in your knowledge. This book is for you.Otherwise I wouldn't waste your money.That being said I love Raichlen and did read it cover to cover. But I have never even touched it again compared to many of his other books that I refer to on a weekly basis.
3,good,"recipes are good, slightly disappointed that the description didn't mention these recipes were from around the world but overall good stuff"
1,Barbecue Bible-too exotic,"I found the book full of strange spices and exotic recipes, way to exotic for your average backyard barbecue. I purchased another of his books and it was much more useful, full of colored pictures, and ideas. This book was a waste of money unless you are really really into cooking. Never heard of most of the ingredients used in his book. Also, no good color photos."
1,Not worth your time,"I love to barbeque. I love finding new recipes, so a book called the barbeque bible seemed great. This author seemed to worry more about filling the book with as many recipes as possible rather than making sure the recipes were of high quality. I will say that this book is probably good for the beginer. I think a better book would be anything by cooks illustrated. They test every recipe thoroughly."
3,"""Bible"" is misleading....","This book is a huge tome dedicated to the world of barbecue. If you want to know how to just cook a steak or how to tell those chicken breasts are done, you might want to look elsewhere. It seems that the basics have been sacrificed in an effort to include all types of cuisine."
3,Reads more like a travel journal than a Barbecue Bible,"I was hoping to find a live fire cooking book that compares to my dog-earedNew Grilling Book. 2nd Edition, but I did not. This book reads more like a travel journal, it is filled with short stories about eating fire cooked food around the world. The table of contents only list 3 select recipes in a section (beef, pork, poultry, fish...) outside of that, one is left to hunting through the index.I must not be a fire fanatic like the author, I do not believe every course of a great barbecue meal must come from an open fire (even the desserts in this book are grilled). There are some awesome recipes in this book, if one can find them. I still recommend the BH&G; New Grilling Book as the MUST HAVE addition to any outdoor cooking library. This book seems more geared to grillers wanting to experiment with new foreign recipes."
5,Great bbq book,"This is a must have for grillers. It's got tons of great recipes for meats, veggies, fruits, and sauces. We've used many recipes and they've all been great."
5,Awesome!!!,"If you enjoy grilling and BBQ-ing, this book is awesome. My husband and I grill all through the year and we love to try all the new things this book has to offer. Definitely worth every penny."
5,"Bought one for friends, is that good",I had this book for years and bought again to give as gift to friend that wanted to learn to grill better. This book should be in every serious grillers library.
5,Must have!!!,A comprehensive treatment of every phase of the art of grilling and barbecuing. A must have for anyone that has ever put food to flame anywhere in the outdorrs. No detail has been left out. Yay Steve!!!!!!!
5,AWESOME BOOK,BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS A CHEF--- HE LOVES IT - CAN'T WAIT TO TRY OUT SOME OF THE RECIPES ---
5,What a pleasent surprise!,"By the title of the book, I thought I had bought a hotdog/hamburger book. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is an very thoroughly planned book wich covers recipies from all around the world and goes from a piña colada to French grilled snails (tastier than it sounds), from Brazil to Bali. If you are looking for different ways of preparing whole meals (from appetizers to dessert) combining new flavours, this is THE book. Much better than the Joy of Cooking (the grilling one) which is a bit presumptious. As the author says, Barbecue! is a book for those who enjoy setting things ablaze and throwing food into it."
3,BBQ Joy,It provided some helpful hints and general knowledge but I found the Joy of Cooking to much more comprehensive.
5,Great book,Bought for my husband and he and a son in law looked through it as soon as all the gifts were opened.Hubby even looked at it instead often tellie. :)
5,The essential BBQ Book,My husband and I have long enjoyed Steve Raichlen's PBS shows and this book is the perfect BBQ companion for keeping all these tips and recipies at your fingertips.
4,cooking,"this was a christmas present, my brother in law has a copy and after reading his i had to have my own, can't wait to try some, we like barbeque here."
2,looked great but poor quality,"I bought this bracelet for my wife, and it is a great design but has already broken twice. my wife never did take it off so that might have been the problem. i wish is was made out of some stronger material."
1,"An intimate video, but was a letdown.","I bought this video with great expectations, but was overall a letdown. Barry's Christmas CD cover was warm and inviting, but this video doesn't capture any of it. I've been a fan for a long time, but this video will go up for Ebay auction."
1,Imported Junk,The shredder worked fine until cogs in the gear box stripped. Of course this happened six months after the one year warranty. I called Fellowes to see if I could purchase new gears but was told parts are unavailable.
2,Publication - Lacking basic information,"Ifeel the author did not go into sufficent detail to explain how to determine the correct tension of blade; any easy techniques to thread blade for inside cuts; hints on proper feed of project into blade for clean, smooth cuts etc. In short, lacking information a rank novis should know to better assist in proper or easier ways to become proficient in sawing, rather than having to learn from trial and error."
3,"works alright, but nothing special","I am currently using this with clip #3 on myBugaboo Bee Stroller and Canopy - Pinkon the unextended part of the chassis, with the seat facing me and in full recline... I had it clipped facing outwards initially so that I could collapse the stroller, however, found that it added a few inches to the width of the stroller so I switched it facing inwards since I rarely collapse my stroller anyway.I like the plastic pieces on the inside that help my drink fit snugly (an improvement over the cupholder in theGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Framethat I had been using previously), however, by placing it facing inwards, at times my baby could kick the cup holder, which could be an issue if she was doing it while there was a drink in it. Also, I feel like it should come with the stroller, and not cost over $20. Basically, it works fine and I use it everyday, but there's nothing great about it to warrant the high price tag."
3,Works well but fragile,"Good, but several of the plastic 'fans' inside broke pretty soon. I used it in chilly conditions but not with unreasonabe size mugs/bottles. Folding chassis with cup holder on works, but in general this is not up to Bugaboo standard."
4,"Not perfect, but try putting them on the inside!","The other reviews get the pros and cons pretty right, so I won't elaborate there... rather I'll make a suggestion - try clipping the cup holders so that they face inside instead of outside. I got so frustrated early on when I kept running into things with them that I made this switch and much prefer it. It makes tipping the seat all the way back difficult when the seat is facing away from the parent, but I barely ever need to do that, so it doesn't matter to me. I also don't have a problem collapsing the stroller with the cup holders still attached."
2,Not well thought out design,"As another reviewer mentioned already, the idea of having a cup holder mounted on the outside of an already fairly wide stroller is a total flop. Within two days of attaching it we hit so many door frames, gates, etc. that we decided to return the product (before it gets busted). Two stars for holding bottles well and not breaking after being hit a few times."
3,"Handy, but not durable","It's nice to have a cupholder on our Buggaboo, but the plastic tongs on the inside that are meant to stabilize cups of different sizes tend to break off over time. Somewhat of a chafe when you spend $25 on it."
3,Can't collapse Bee stroller with it on.,"I have a Bee. While the cup holder is sturdy, you can't collapse the stroller all the way without taking the cup holder off. It fits on the thicker, lower part of the stroller handles, just below the collapse/release buttons. The cup comes with 4 different attachment pieces, one for each type of bugaboo stroller. You think for $25 the bee attachment would be designed a bit better and allow you to leave it on."
3,Every day another Buga-boo boo!,"It seems like every accessory I have bought for my bugaboo Chameleon has been a bust. The cupholder can be added to the list. The suggestion to mount the holder on the outside of the handle means that it becomes a prime target to hitting a wall or obstruction in your way. That means that either you are lucky and the cupholder will survive for another hit, or the flimsy interal holder will break.Well 2 days with the cup holder on, and scenario 2 occured. It blows me away that Bugaboo designed and built such a poorly thought of accessory.I gave 2 stars out of 5 for the following:minus 1 for being over priced for what is already a expensive strollerminus 2 for breaking its functional use.The thing can still hold a bottle, but not secure."
2,does not stay in place,The cup holder is very easy to install but it does not stay in place.It was quite expensive for something that keeps falling even when there are no cups in it.I bought it for my Bugaboo Bee.
2,Broken,"Worked great for a few months, until the internal holder broke, rendering the whole thing useless. Also since you have to take it off everytime you fold it down, it quickly became lost. It would be better if it was somehow integrated into the stroller. Poorly constructed."
1,WARNING: Do not put your phone in this cup holder!,"I'm giving the review a low score to get people's attention. Don't make the mistake I made! I thought I was being smart wedging my phone between the little pegs, but after a bump my phone fell out. It happened a few times when I was talking on my iPhone with my hands free set, so I noticed immediately. However, one very sleep deprived day, my phone fell out and it was not be found by me. Also, there is a hole in the bottom that precludes you from putting keys in the cup holder too.As for a using the cup holder as intended, it's very handy and great! I would give the product a 3.5-4 star review. Make sure you use a strong cup that can withstand the tension in the pegs."
5,Read This Book!,"I'm not a reader, normally, but I read DARK NIGHTS for a book report I had to do in my junior year of high school. I'm really glad I did because I actually liked this book and wanted to finish it. I felt like I had to finish it to get some closure. I received a good grade on the book report, by the way.Max Luden is such a great bad guy. When the heroine, Dr. Sydney Rochester, looks into his eyes for the first time, she notices how chilling his winter gray eyes are and sees a demon in his eyes, a complete absence of good. The dude is bad. Really bad. He's a cannibalistic serial killer loose in middle America. And he wants some serious one-on-one time with Dr. Rochester, and the FBI Agent guarding her, the same man who caught him before, Garon Sloan.All the characters are cool. The ending is great. And, it's a short book that goes by really fast.Seriously, if you like suspense with sex sprinkled in, read this book! I can't wait to read Shelley Dawn's next book, SWEET, SWEET JESSIE."
3,Curd Duca - Elevator 3,"Curd Duca keeps things short and sweet with Elevator 3, an album of tiny bits and pieces of songs, almost all of which last under a minute and a half. Obviously, there's little songwriting to speak of -- with an experimental work such as this, it's important to judge the work on its own standards. So, since the subtitle of the album boasts that this is ""digitalanalog mood music,"" but the tracks don't really last long enough to establish any sort of mood whatsoever. The tracks do create an intriguing aural background, however, with wisps of melody, sudden percussion hits, or stuttering vocal samples augmenting the feel. Definitely an interesting listening experience, even though I'm not sure exactly what to make of it."
5,The best history of the evolution of beach vacations!,"I finally found a book that takes the reader through the history of society's love for the beach! It is a wonderfully light and easy read that reveals tons of interesting information about beach going. As a sand dune ecologist, I was very impressed with the representation of the present problems facing beach development. The historical trace enables the reader to understand why we keep pouring money into a disappearing shoreline!"
3,"As beach reading, it's OK","As a lifelong beach-lover, I picked this book up just before leaving on vacation to -- you guessed it -- the beach. I read it while sitting -- right again -- on the beach. Unfortunately, neither the book nor the vacation were especially enjoyable and I left it behind -- on the beach. I hope the next person who occupies the beach cottage enjoys the book -- and has a better vacation.While the authors have dug up a lot of interesting material, I felt that I was not so much reading a book as reading the notes for a book. Had to resist the urge to tear out all the pages and put them in the ""right"" order."
5,Supergroup,The greatest supergroup never to be seen again. Perfect mix of drunken pyschos doing fantastic music that would make the clowns at The Rock and Roll Hall of Lame quake in their booties.
5,"Features David Cripps, horn","This is a great recording which features the entire Midsummer Night's Dream. For me, a highlight is hearing David Cripps perform as principal horn, especially during the Nocturne. (Cripps is well known for his beautiful solos in both Star Wars and Superman)I found it to be a crisp and well interpreted performance."
4,Best recording out there,"I purchased and downloaded the album online from amazon.com. It is a really good recording in terms of the music, tempo, sound quality etc. I'm really satisfied with my purchase."
4,Midsummer Night's dreaming,"My only complaint is that the recorded sound is a little on the thin side. The performance is superb, and includes the vocal and choral parts that are often overlooked, which are done superbly"
1,Not As Advertised,Feeder did not come with all parts advertised. Company acknowledged mistake but would do nothing to correct except allow me to send it back at my expense.
5,Best feeder I've found,"This hummingbird feeder is a keeper; my birds have not had to fight off bees and ants to get to their food. It is easy to clean, refill and hang! I'm enjoying the hummingbird population in my yard now more than ever."
4,Good but not the best,I was skeptical when I received this hummingbird feeder. It is easy to clean and fill. I have 3-6 feeders out much of the time. By far the best I have used are the old Perky Pet 16 oz # 210 glass feeders. Not the easiest to clean. They do not blow around in the wind as much as the Hummzinger. The birds can feed to the last drop with the Perky Pet. They do not seem to be able to reach the bottom of the Hummzinger. They are fun to watch with 8 or more hummingbirds feeding on them.
1,Hummingbird feeder is a waste of money,I bought 2 of these feeders and one umbrella last spring and tried them for a season (along with a couple of the cheap glass hourglass cylindrical types). I had to replace nectar almost every day in these two feeders because the slightest breeze caused the nectar to spill out onto the ground. I have just thrown them away and replaced the two of them with the cheap glass ones from Lowes.
5,Fantastic Feeder,"I was plagued with bees most of the summer. Then I bought the Aspects feeder and my bee problem vanished. It is easy to fill, easy to clean, and the birds use it all the time. I am so grateful for having found it."
5,humming bird feeder,Excellent product. Easy to clean. Strudy. I would suggest this product for any one wanting to attract hummers. Bees don't bother it and when you want to clean it there are no small areas that are hard to get to for cleaning. I have 2 for myself and I gave one to my daughter.
3,Keeps the bees out,"I bought 2 because of the number of hummers in my yard. I had a terrible problem with bees, and they kept the nesting hummers from feeding. As stated in the product guidelines, the holes are too small for bees--it worked! The bees found other sources of food. Because of the shape and size, other birds feed as well--they are fun to watch. However, small insects do get inside, so be careful when opening them to clean and refill--you may get some flying insects in your house!"
5,It Really Attracts Hummingbirds!!!,"I was skeptical at first; nothing is going to attract hummingbirds to my front lawn. Boy, was I wrong! I have never seen a hummer in my life, and when I placed this feeder up, they came! What a wonderful product!Make sure you mix the right solution. For this feeder, I use 1/2 cup of white sugar to 2 cups of warm spring water. You need to mix until the sugar is dissolved and change ""at least"" twice a week in the warmer months.This product is also very easy to take apart and clean. I rinse and brush the feeder out well with hot water before I use it again.Another feature I love, no flying, creeping, or crawling bugs when you clean this feeder... Amen to that!!!"
3,I could use another disc!,"Eddy Raven was one of many country artists I grew up hearing on the radio, which is why I bought this disc. A few of the songs I used to hear are on here (I Got Mexico, Right Hand Man, Sometimes A Lady) but I was disappointed not to get others (I Could Use Another You, She's Gonna Win Your Heart, Never Too Old For Young Love). I hope a more comprehensive compilation is made within the next few years."
3,huh,"The book was good but it was a little to much like a romance novel,I guess I am more interested in his military history than sexual history"
5,"This is NOT ""Memoirs of a Geisha""!","I was a bit confused for the first couple of chapters of this galloping mystery, but then I realized that the principal characters were confused, too. There are three main proponents: Richard Mitchell, semi-novice financier from Yorkshire who has relocated to Tokyo to seek his fortune, Kazuo Mori, hard-boiled private detective (or ""economic and social researcher""), who takes on a case involing the mysterious death of and old friend?s daughter, and Tamura, assistant manager of one of the most important branches of one of Japan?s most important banks, who wakes to find himself in a love hotel with the corpse of an attractive young woman... As the several threads begin to draw closer together, and as you begin to discern what the real threats are, you?ll find yourself staying up late to finish the book..."
2,Tsumaranai,"I usually love things Japaneese but this novel was nothing to get excited about. It was too occidental in its sensibilities unlike the outstanding ""Memoires of a Geisha"" . There was no Japaneese vocabulary as in ""Shogun"". Exciting but ""Rising Sun"" was perhaps better, And there was only one example of kinky sex which is ubiquitous in ""Mizu Shobai""."
1,Don't believe them.,"We visited two of the so-called 'Best' all-inclusives in this book, and they were terrible (neglected, unkept, terrible food). I wouldn't trust this book, and certainly would not use it to plan a hard-earned vacation."
2,A short story,"I did not think the premise of the story believable. If I say more, I may give it away. I have read some of the authors other books. They are a little too old-fashioned for me."
2,Fodder fer ya,"From the back cover: ""Slocum was a wanted man. Everywhere he turned, someone was trying to put a bullet through his head. Only Howard Rice, the eccentric millionaire, owner of gold mines and the most exquisite collection of women in the world, trusted Slocum with his gold and his women. But the fun couldn't last. Someone wanted that gold so badly he would stop at nothing to get it. Alone, unable to trust anyone, Slocum was faced with the most ruthless men he had ever encountered.""First of all, let me just say that the back cover is a tad misleading. ""Most exquisite collection"" amounts to only two; ""most ruthless men"" really aren't all that. The plot is mundane and the reader is able to pick out the bad guy many pages before it dawns on Slocum. There are some fun part, and that's why I'm giving this one two stars, instead of just one. 187 pages. A quick read. ***"
4,US Civil Aircraft Series. Vol. 2,"Excellent book for reviewing old aircraft. In fact, I would like to find the next book, (vol #3). This book was written years ago and has old pictures of each airplane in black and white with a 1-3 page discription of each. Excellent for doing research which is what I am using it for."
3,Ancient,"One of these fat library texts. Resonably ancient, hence not terribly useful except for structural data."
4,college,I am a high school student in an AP class. It is a good educational tool. I would recommend it.
2,Serious limitation,"Not a bad light, easy install, good sensor. BUT aiming the mount is done in the usual way with one axis (roll) at the actual mounting plate and the other (elevation) done at the knuckle behind the lamp itself. So if it is aimed at an oblique angle the lamp head ends up rotated considerably, which would be fine except the tag for the lightbulb itself says it must be level to +_4 degrees. That means the light must be aimed almost straight out from the wall it's on to minimize rotation. That is a really severe limitation unless that direction happens to light up what you want."
3,Decent - but nothing special - original bulb blew quickly,"My only real issue with this light is the original generic brand bulb lasted about a month. So I can tack on another $5 to the cost of mine for the additional bulb. The new bulb is Sylvania, so hopefully it will last a couple years. Yes, I know not to touch the bulb and I wore latex gloves.Other than the bulb, the light is pretty decent at detecting movement consistantly. I feel it provides security and that's why I bought it."
4,A good value,"Construction quality is fair and the unit works mostly as designed. This is not a super bright light if you are looking to find contact lenses on the pavement at night, but 150 watts is 150 watts and that's what you get. And actually I did not want it to be super because as a result of it being to sensitive, it comes on when it is very windy and probably detects movement in my Arbor Vitaes that line my drive. I do have it set to a low sensitive and have decided I can live with the occasion hiccup. Works well as a standard light. Flip off and back on and it stays on. Toggle again and it goes back to its movement sensing mode. You can pay a lot more for the same product and still get the same quality and operation. Recommend."
3,The lights work great.....,The lights work great but be prepared to replace the original bulbs within a short time. I purchased and installed 3 of these lights and within 30 days all three bulbs were bad. I purchased replacement bulbs from Amazon and both bulbs were bad (one broken and one a broken filament). I suggest you purchase the bulbs locally (so you don't have to hassle with a return) and add the cost of a replacement bulb to this item.
4,Good light,"Product arrived in timely manner.Product was as advertized.I had a professional electrician install the light on my front porch area.He had one problem with an included mounting screw that was too short.He was able to supply a substitute screw.The mounting box is a bit non-fitting.I will need to putty around the gap between wall and light box.In my case, I live in a windy area and have a large tree with low branches near the porch.When the wind blows, the moving branches cause the light to go on.I really like the fact the light can be overridden by the wall switch.Good product at a reasonable price.A Word of Caution: I did not realize how sensitive these new types of light bulbs are.Unless you are having a professional install the light, be careful handling the bulb.My electrician put on a glove to touch the bulb as bare fingers will cause it to fail."
3,cheap plastic base,"The packaging indicates durable metal construction but the mounting base of this light is cheap plastic made in China. The mounting holes are not even molded in. Instead they are only indentations in the plastic. The instruction says to break them out with a screwdriver and hammer but I suspect that would just shatter the plastic base so I drilled them out. The jam nut that holds the light to the base is metal and likely to strip out or break the plastic if tightened too hard. You will also need to buy a 4"" junction box to mount this on as it does not come with one. You get what you pay for here. I would have paid more for a better light but this one had the wattage and features I was looking for."
4,Make it Bight!,"During the night the side yard is pitch black and you can't even see the gate from the kitchen window six feet away. This one light gives nice even coverage of the whole 11x40 foot area, no problemo.The only reason I rated it 4 instead of five stars, is that the base plate is made from plastic instead of metal and the motion sensor does not have the indicator light that theHeath Zenith SL-5512-BZ-B 300-Watt Quartz Halogen Motion-Sensing Twin Security Light, Bronzehas, but these are really minor issues, I would rate it a 4.75 if that was possible."
4,Mixed Feelings,Bought this light 3 months ago and the sensor has failed. I will call their service dept tomorrow and see what they say. It has a 5 year warranty so I will be interested in how they resolve it. It worked well till it failed so 3 stars for now.Update: Heath-Zenith customer service sent me an entire new fixture which is working just fine. Service was fast and courteous. I have raised my rating from 3 to 4 stars to reflect company backing of their product.
1,"very bad quarlity. I bought 3, only one works now.","very bad quarlity. I bought 3, only one works now. I have to replace those two with another kind one."
1,security light,light worked for a short time. light comes on at night and stayes on all night. i will go to lowes and get my next light!!
4,it works,the light works; the sensor is not that sensible; you have to be somewhere within 5 meters to trigger it;Fine overall
5,Great Sensing Light,Was very easy to install! Coverage area is excellent - I have had this for a month now and I am very happy with it!
5,An excellent portrait of all sides of Boston and a great read,"Not many authors write about Boston in a way that gives you its full flavor--from Copley Square to the heart of Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan, you come away from this book with both an intimate knowledge of its central characters and of the diversity of Boston's communities.This novel is fun and engaging but don't let the ""chiclet"" packaging fool you. There's some serious themes in there as well and the main character ends up having to take a break from shopping designer labels and do some deep soul searching about who she is, what she wants out of life, and who she wants to spend her life with."
2,not interested,I was hoping thias was a good book because I like dthe cover lol well its not! the book was boring and I love to read but I stopped after like 30 pages because I got bored. The book dragged and it seems this writer is trying to copy a style that didnt fit her very well I love girly books (like by shophie kinsella) and this was jus not gooD!
5,Enjoyable,"I just finished this book today, and I enjoyed it. I felt for Weslee. I could relate to the character, and it was good to see her go on her journey and how much she grew in the spanse of a year. It's interesting to read this case study on Blacks and class, and how it all intersects. This would make for a great read at the beach or during a cool autumn day."
5,Intelligent thriller,"Obviously when a movie sets out to be a thriller about Northern Ireland with British secret service people bugging, stalking, and shooting down folks in the street, alot of people will get angry with its politics-as can be seen from some of the reviews.But it is an excellent thriller. Loach is a great director, and he really gets the pace of it right (i felt uncomfortable for the entire duration-a mark of a good thriller!) The ending was a little abrupt, but in retrospect probably the only realistic way of doing it (unless you want Margaret Thatcher to jump out and blow every one away with a semi-automatic). I'd definitely recommend this one."
2,plodding,"Purports to take the audience behind the scenes at the highest levels of political intrigue, but the creators of this movie don't have the IQ or background to pull it off.A quick-to-describe example of the whole is how they present the character whose murder kicks off the plot. We're told that he's a first-rate lawyer from the USA. But there's not the slightest hint of mental acuity in anything he does. We're left with just the writer's word for it.And that's how the plot works, too. The progress of the protagonists through the investigation is unearned, just dumped in their laps.Lacking insight, uninspired."
4,Engrossing film,"Terrorism by police? This concerns the ongoing conflict in Northern Ireland. I can't really give too much away, I hate when people do that in a review. It all concerns taped conversations and murder, of course. You can really feel the dedication of the actors."
5,Hidden Agenda,Accurately portrays the struggles of the Irish people in their quest to have a united and free Ireland ruled by the Irish.
4,are you ready?,"""mindfulness"" is a short text explaining in some detail the practice of what i imagine is ""pure"" buddhist meditation. it made me want to follow all of the suggestions. it made me want to do a 10 day silent meditation retreat. it teaches a practice that REQUIRES practice and far more discipline than i have developed yet, in this lifetime. i highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in meditation, buddhist practices, in looking toward their spiritual side. ""mindfulness"" is appropriate for all humans, any age. unless the reader is already enlightened, i assume it will need to be read atleast twice. it is very handy for use as a reference guide to meditation;like a simple handbook. it's content is only complicated by the reader's resistances to the discipline or philosophy."
4,A Life Changing Exsperience!,I was recently visiting Universal Studios Hollywood (my favorite theme park) when I heard about a live taping of a show called Power Living by Jake. I went to the show and during the breaks they played games. I won two games and recieved two books. Power Living by Jake is a book that will motivate you to go beyound your comfort level and be the best you can be!
5,INSPIRATIONAL -- Pumped My Mind,"Jake Steinfield, exercise guru to the stars, has muscled his way into the motivation field. The result is a strong effort about how to improve your life. Jake gives healthy advice backed up by his own personal experiences. It's down-to-earth and downright interesting. While Jake may have the biggest muscles in Hollywood, this book proves that Jake's best muscle is his brain."
4,Delicious Chicken Soup to Nurture the Girlfriend's Soul,"This is another in the wonderful series of Chicken Soup books. I belong to a great group of women who get together each month to shop, eat, travel, have fun! This book gathers wit and wisdom from all over the world, putting into words that elusive 'girlfriend' relationship. There are stories of courage and weakness, sickness and health, sadness and hilarity - all the ingredients you expect from Chicken Soup. Share it with your girlfriends!"
3,I only give it 3 stars:,"But I am fixing to see the movie soon but it throws me that they show the picture of a Tyranosaurus Rex bones on the cover but it has nothing to do with archeology or the subject matter of dinosaurs but it's an analogy for being old or getting old and curmudgeingly (if I said that right) I'm middle aged and I feel that way quite often because things aren't getting any better, someone over the weekend stold my 2 bicycles from under my stairs at the apartment I live in and I'm pissed because I'm back to walking for a short period. I'm not as happy as I'd like to be."
1,Cheap,The best you can do is kill the dog in the first 2 minutes? That's how you establish the conflicted nature of the protagonist? Do people really still fall for this cheap shortcut?Don't waste your time on this POS.
4,Amazon - Please give us the option of Captions.,"Another excellent Paddy Considine (written & directed by) movie - But I missed about 30% of the dialogue.The same happened with Dead Man's Shoes (starring Paddy Considine).I don't know why just a hand full of the Instant Movies here on Amazon have Closed Captioning, but these are excellent movies, driven by great character acting and realistic dialogue.Amazon - Please give us the option of Captions on more movies."
4,bali stretch lace body,"This is a very good product, lightweight, but good support, and pretty to look at. It is an underwired garment( I wasnt aware of this) so I have removed the wires and its fine."
5,Love this briefer,The lace makes this briefer so breathable. it's not suffocating like most of the others I've purchased. The lace also makes it pretty. Just wish it came in a 'nude' color. The item came quickly. Great customer service.
3,Nice but smaller than size stated,Nice look but smaller than size stated. I would order one size up in order to breathe and move in it.
5,Bring back Bali #7432 Body Briefer!!,This product has been unavailable for quite some time. This is the best body briefer on the market. The rest are torture tubes. Can't tell you how many styles I've brought home and taken back. I'm still wearing the Bali lace briefer that I have even though it's time to retire it. I can't find a suitable replacement. Help!
1,I NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER FROM THE MERCHANT!,I desperately needed this book for a class that was starting up. I paid for express shipping. It's been over a month and I have still not received my order!This is B.S.!
4,Nice resource to learn with,"I reviewed the Oxford Take Off in Japanese about three weeks ago and was very disappointed. Fortunately this is not the case with Oxford's French version. I found the material to be much more in depth, interesting and easy to follow. There is also one more disc than the Japanese version and a pocket dictionary. One thing that did bother me was the different accents, often for the same words, but I guess that's true in all cultures. Anyway, I've worked with Take Off in French for a couple of weeks now, I'm very satisfied with it and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn French (and not just for tourists)."
5,Just Great,"As a big Bob Wills fan I was doubtful that this CD could live up to my expectations. Well, they did. Amazingly true to form and with two great vocalists (I hate it when you get a cd and you like one vocalist and not the other). Not a bad song on the disc, I really like ""Sugar Mama"" and ""Everybody's Fool"". Now I just wish I had it on vinyl so it would have some nice hisses and pops."
5,Terrific Value,"The symphonies of Mahler are among the most important in the orchestra repertoire, and they have been widely recorded by numerous orchestras and conductors. One rendition which often seems to be passed up however, is this one, with renowned American director James Conlon and the Guzenich Orchestra, the same orchestra that originally premiered the symphony back in 1904.I happen to like this rendition. The Guzenich plays with a clear tone and brings out a solid performance, from those opening brass fanfares to the deeply felt Adagietto for strings and harp. At a great budget price, I highly recomend this one."
1,Don't buy these,"unless you want your tiny rodent escaping! These tubes are so long, if any weight is put on them, they open where the two pieces of plastic that form the tube meet! Bad design; some sort of locking joint along the two sides would probably prevent it. Returned. :("
3,This book is a very good begining to the series.,This book is very good. I enjoyed it enough to want to get and read the rest of the series.
3,Could be better...,"I've read all of the Belgariad, and I was somewhat disappointed with what I found... This is good fantasy, but the characters I think are generally underdeveloped...I did, however, like Silk. He was one of the few well developed non-flat characters. I must say, however...That if you are a true fantasy person...Tolkien is still god. =)"
4,enough of the gender wars!,"I enjoyed reading this book. In it I found an excellent balance of dialogue and description. This book was so cleanly written I felt myself just breezing through it. I also found the characters to be really funny and likeable.The only complaint I had was about the seemingly constant bickering. I didn't enjoy watching these supposedly smart and sometimes ancient characters picking away at each other. The theme I am especially getting tired of is this story of the ""hen pecked man""; the poor men who must constantly put up with bitchy women. The only thing I'd really want to change in this book would be it's tendency to represent overly sympathetic men while creating, for the most part, antogonistic women. I would have figured that after having lived for 7000 years the characters Pol and Mr.Wolf would be more mature and have transended this most commonplace gendered hostility.Overall though this book is a definate must read - Eddings is a very talented writer!"
2,Thoughts on Pawn of Prophesy,"I finally finished reading Pawn of Prophesy. This is a book I was told to read when I was 13, and sadly that's when I would have enjoyed it most."
3,It's good for what it is...,"Ok, I'll keep this short. The book is undoubtably written for children. It's interesting enough, and might be worth reading if you're looking for mindless fantasy, but other than for that purpose, don't bother."
4,Great Series with a great start,"A Must Read for any fantasy or non-fantasy fan. The book moves along fantastically. It is not overly detailed, and therefor moves along at a great pace.The story centers around Garion and his mysterious Aunt Pol. The story starts on the farm that Garion grew up in, raised by his Aunt Pol. A few events quickly take place and we are gathered into the story as it moves from place to place in an exciting, but unpredictable journey.A wide range of characters makes this story great.Check it out, you wont regret it."
3,Great children's literature.,"This would be an awesome book for a seventh or eighth grader to read or maybe a bright sixth grader to read with a parent. Classic storyline, simple and quick-moving adventure, colorful characters. It just isn't really complex, gritty, or novel enough for an adult audience. 5 stars for kids, 2 stars for adults, average=3 stars (rounded down because this is passed off as adult literature by your local book store)."
2,"Dull characters, incomplete plot.","In ""Pawn of Prophecy,"" the incomplete plot gradually introduces a set of characters, but virtually nothing happens to them. The characters are thin, as the blatant foreshadowing screams that Pol and Wolf are far more than just a simple cook and a storyteller, and Gorion will inevitably be the farm boy who rises to greatness and saves the world. The only thing more tedious than Aunt Pol's constant scolding of Gorion after he was well beyond boyhood was the glacial pace of Eddings's plot as the party traveled in a circle from city to city, looking for some nameless artifact they never could find. Eddings creates a colorful world of seven different lands, each inhabited by multiple races, but he doesn't develop most of them beyond simple caricatures and the different races become just names the reader has to remember. Eddings writes well and firmly develops his world, but without a more complete story line, ""Pawn of Prophecy"" is just 290 pages worth of introduction."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"By the numbers.Get farm boy. Check.Know powerful wizard. Check.Need magic thingo. Check.Get helpers. Check.Fight dark lord. Check.Get away unscathed. Check.Or, if you are young and haven't come across anything else, this will seem better at the time. It won't seem better if you only read it because of having read everything else and it was your sister than had it.Anyway, absolutely standard ordinary fantasy offering that is very light and designed to appeal to a female audience.2.5 out of 5"
2,Round and Round.,Maybe I missed something. I don't know. I bought this book after the reading some of the great reviews of David Eddings. This was the first book I have read by Eddings and so far I am not very impressed. I found this book to be a bit pointless. There was not any great plot. A boy trying to figure out who he is. Nobody telling him much. So he gets angry constantly at his Aunt and others. This plot just went over and over. And even by the end of the book he still does not know much. I had to force myself to finish the book. I just can't figure out why this book got so many great reviews. Instead I would recommend George R.R. Martin for anyone looking to start a fantasy series
2,Mediocre Fare,"I am still trying to understand how this series got so many good ratings. After reading this, I bought the series only to be really disappointed.This book is filled with shallow story line; hackneyed characters; generic setting. The problem is you never get passionate about the character to root for victory or failure. This is essential for any fantasy book.Surprisingly, I see so many comparisons with Tolkein or George R R Martin. There is no way this work (supposedly among his best) comes close to Tolkein's work and George R R Martin's Song of Ice and Fire has some complex plots and great character development.The only reason I am writing this review is to ensure that people like me don't get ripped off thinking that that this series is great and waste money on it.If you are browsing the site to check if you want to invest in this author, then be warned, that the overall ratings belie the actual quality of the book/series."
1,Too Simple Minded For Adults,"I read about 90% of this book and then I just stopped. I was starting to wonder if this is intended to be adult fantasy or is it meant for young adults?The plot is unbelievably linear and the characters are mostly one-dimensional. The different racial groups are shallow stereotypes. And, finally, I don't find the world all that compelling. Pawn of Prophecy reads like a relic from the 1960s.This might be a fun read for a teen. But it really doesn't have enough depth to hold the interest of somebody who has been reading the really excellent adult fantasy that is available today.I recommend looking into the works of Steven Erikson or George RR Martin or R.Scott Bakker instead of this."
5,"Superior Struggles with Gods, Cultures and Politics, with hu","I found the five books of the Belgariad by David Eddings to be very fulfilling. He followed the basic fantasy plot that I am tired of reading, but it was fun light reading nevertheless. His books include interesting races of men and Gods, but no elves or hobbits or dwarves. While I would have preferred more edge and less happily-ever-after to the plight of his characters. I found his character's relationship to their Gods superbly conceived and very interesting."
4,Really Good Starter,"This book is a really good starter to the series. While many people complain about all the unanswered questions, I'm glad that they are left that way. This creates the excitement to read the next books. Also, I really love how each character has their own personality and history. This book only gets four stars though because there were many repetitive lines, and once in a while, the book would get dull for a chapter or two. However, Pawn of Prophecy is a great book altogether."
5,Eddings' only notable series,"I read the Belgariad series in 1986 and I remember how enchanted I was with the world and the characters Eddings created. Its a pity, in my opinion, that he failed to instill the same sense of wonder and adventure in his other series including the sequel to the Belgariad -- The Mallorean Saga.Enjoy the epic that is The Belgariad. Dont bother about Eddings' other works (Mallorean, Tamuli etc etc). They are not as good."
2,Classic Fantasy,"This was not deep or boring but good light reading. This is ENTERTAINMENT, not meant to make us think to much. That is why I think it is good. It has all the classical fantasy elements, including a lot of scorcery. If you like books that help releive stress and can take you away from the world for a brief moment then this is the book for you."
2,Don't let this one discourage you from reading the rest.,"When I finished reading ""Pawn"" I was so angry that one of my co-workers had suggested it to me. It was slow, and I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters at the end of the book. However, my friend assurred me that the following books in the ""Belgariad"" built upon this first book, and that I wouldn't regret reading this book once I was done with the series. He was absolutely correct. Once I had finished the first five books, I couldn't wait to read more. Now, I read anything I can find by Eddings"
5,A wonderful Series,"I have read many wondrful fantasy series, and while this isn't the best, it is FAR from the worst. This is a great series. I think Eddings developes the characters really well, and gives a lot of description without going too far. During the conversations you can see how the characters evolve and what their personalities are like. The way he works the prophecy into it is masterful, I am now rereading it and understand what is hinted in the prophecy. While it doesn't twist and turn, making you lose understanding in what is happening, it also isn't the predictable, Me hero. Me kill bad guy. There's a lot more to it. You realy should read this book."
4,Good start,"Garion lives the life of a simple farm boy until the day a storyteller comes to his village and convinces Garion's aunt that they must leave immediately. As their quest continues, Garion grows confused and must question everything he ever knew about himself. Why do his aunt and this storyteller seem to have powers that Garion doesn't believe in? Why do they have such powerful friends? This story of sorcery and adventure begins the Belgariad, an epic fantasy in which Garion must fight against the powers of evil in order to save his world. This book was quite enjoyable. It had fantastic characterization (to the point that I was actually getting angry at characters along with Garion). It had an interesting mystery to it because although I could make an educated guess, I don't know the plot of the Belgariad so I don't know exactly where it's going. Quite a good introduction to the characters, land, and problem-to-be-solved."
5,i keep going back to read this series,"I love this series. The books are simple, escapist and fun to read, the storyline is linear and easy to follow (which should be bad but its not). As a literary piece it is not much good but by God it is an enjoyable read. I have found that I keep coming back and reading the series over and over again. Not because i missed anythign the first time, but because its fun. It brings a smile to my face every time and I thoroughly recommend it to kindle readers now that Castle of Wizardry is available on kindle too."
4,An old story well-told,"It is always good to read a story well-told, with characters that grab your attention and that you can relate to. Of course it is not Shakespeare and neither is the story line new or original, but you just want to know what happens next. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series."
4,A great read!,"I actually read both the Belgariad and the Malloreon as they were being published. They are great popcorn fantasy. Don't expect anything deep because the characters are defined almost entirely by static description and the manner of their speech with frequent sitcom-like quips and jokes. It definitely isn't literature and is often times predictable, but it's so much fun that you can't help but lose yourself in the joy of the ride. If you want something light-hearted and fun as well as completely fattening, easily digested and wholly non-nutritional, then pig out! It's a great series!"
4,A little too predictable,"The first book of the Belgariad was a very good start to the series. I found it a little too predictable though. In the introduction where it describes Belgarath using the guise of a wolf, that gave me the suspicion that the storyteller (mister wolf) was indeed Belgarath. The same thing happened with the aunt pol is polgara thing.Besides that, the book flows well and has an interesting storyline. It slowly builds up the suspense in the end wanting to make you finish the book. Overall, Pawn of Prophecy was a good read."
4,Great books that are character and dialogue-oriented,"The ""Pawn of Prophecy"" was the first fantasy book I ever read, and I enjoyed it immensely. I would *really* reccommend it for people who are thinking about reading fantasy books to start with this one. I really love the entire ""Belgariad"" series. These books are full of sarcastic humor, which kept me laughing out loud.One thing about the entire series, and actually an observation of the way the Eddings' write: these books are *extremely* character-oriented, which I found fascinating. You feel as though you know the characters as ""real"" people. This does make for a complicated approach to the genre of fantasy, where the worlds usually take priority over the characters, but I thought Eddings did a fantastic job.To be fair, though, this book isn't nearly as good as the rest. My reccommendation: Get through this one, and read the rest. You won't regret it."
5,Excellent Start,This book is an excellent intro into the world Eddings builds. It slowly allows you to become adjusted to the surroundings and allows to make good guesses into the future events of the story. However none of the surprises of the story are given away while the plot continues. Overall an excellent book.
1,The worst fantasy series I have ever read.,"After completing the entire ten book series, I came to two conclusions. First, here is a clear diagram of how not to write a fantasy series. Do the exact opposite of everything Eddings did, and your story will turn out fine. For example, villians should be more than a name, a physical desciption and a method of dying. They should pose a threat.Second, I can only liken the reading of the Belgariad to dragging myself across broken glass to drink out a toilet. Painful, predictable and with an unsatisfying conclusion."
1,Awful,"If formula books had an aristocracy, this book and its following series would be king. Let's see, we have a rustic country lad who has a great destiny. He is assisted by two magicians, some strong men, and a thief. His mission: to kill the world's source of evil as recorded in a prophecy. Does this sound even faintly familiar? The sequel series follows the exact same plot, too. Talk about lack of creativity."
4,This was a good book but had it's slow moments.,"This was a very good book kicking off the start of the best series that I've read. It had it's slow moments and that's what stopped me from reading it for a while. IT was really slow getting started, but once they met Barak and Silk in the woods then it started moving a bit faster. I read this book again after I finished the Belgariad, the Mallorian and Belgarath the Sorceror and it was a lot better. But the only problem with that was I got most of Polgara and Belgarion's history and I could pick out mistakes that were either made in the Pawn of Prophecy or Belgarath the Sorceror. It definately had it's funny parts though"
5,AWESOME,Mr. Eddings started a ball rolling with this book that I don't think even he knew when it would stop. He puts our dreams on paper with this book...and sets us up for the ride of our life. Geoff Painte
3,Beating a dead horse,"David Eddings has learned well... how to rehash the same story enough times in different ways to net himself a load of money. Throughout the Belgariad (which I did enjoy, light reading, never intense) I was struck by how well this story fits into the cookie cutter image of fantasy. THEN I got to read the same story again, and again, and again, with the Mallorean, Belgarath and Polgara. The horse is dead, David. Let it lie."
3,Who brought this guy?,"Is there supposed to be a plot in this book? Eddings does have SOME talent, but maybe he should try harder next time. I think I'll go back to reading Jordan's Wheel of Time from now on. Now THAT'S quality."
2,"Close, but no sigar","The Belgariad is a collection of good ideas piled together under the influence of Lord of the Rings. The story is too obvious and predictable, and here are too many easy ways out and cheap sollutions in the series to make it really entertaining as a whole. The author has some original ideas and descriptions, which make the book fair enough to read, but im sorry to say that this was not a thrilling experience."
5,The beginning...,"I have read all of the books in the series and i still reread them constantly. Although ""Pawn of Prophecy"" was not my favorite of the series, this book does it's job. It pulls readers into the plot and into the lives of Garion, Aunt Pol and all the others. The characters that Edding's creates become more than just people on a page but real human beings that touch our hearts. They become people that you can relate to and in a way they become real. I have read many series of Fantasy Fiction INCLUDING ""The Wheel of Time"" series by Robert Jordan and none of those characters moved me as much as Garion and the rest.Nothing can compare to what Eddings has written."
5,I buy them in hardback so I'll have them forever!!,"If you're looking for something to occupy your complete attention for a couple of weeks, start reading Eddings' Belgariad and Mallorean. I read all ten books in less than 2 weeks while going to school full time. This one starts out a little slow but before long you'll be hooked!"
4,"Good, but...","I found the first half of this book slow. I felt as though I was reading a preface and not a novel. Still, it was worth reading, and, even if it is one of David's weaker books, I would still recomend it to anybody who enjoys fantasy"
5,Even better on audio,"I have been a major Eddings fan since 1990. While some of his recent works are not quite his originals, the Belgariad is THE original masterpiece. The characters are so well realized they seem like old friends. The storyline is ambitious, and also works well. I have been looking for an audio version for years. Well here it is folks. The reader does a remarkable job of giving voice to the characters, and captures their personalities, as I would envision them, for the most part"
4,Enjoyable read,"Being such a fan of Fantasy it's odd that it's taken me this long to get around to reading the Belgariad series. I quite liked the book and at only about 250 pages it was a quick and refreshing read. The first few chapters are packed with what are now such standard Fantasy cliches (mysterious black rider watching from a distance, parents dead, and on and on) I had to remind myself constantly that this book was written before they had become so hackneyed. That aside, I enjoyed reading the book. I have a minor quibble with the names Eddings chooses, they don't feel perfectly natural to me, but thats not really a big deal. Certain Fantasy authors have made us expect to spend 800+ pages before anything of note happens. Perhaps thats why I felt there was a slight lack of detail that I enjoy, but again, only a minor quibble. The real test is how bady I wanted to read the next volume when I finished this one. I went directly to the bookstore and picked up volume 2."
1,Too dire for words,"An improbable combination of the bodice-ripping excitement of Jane Austin, the concision of Tolstoy and the literary elegance of Philip K Dick; this novel explores the depths of every tired fantasy cliché. Observe Eddings' creative genius at work as he draws past civilisations out of a hat, makes them all American and creates his own fantasy milieu! What should have been taken around the back of the barn and humanly shot, Corgi instead chose to publish, presumably in sympathy for Anne McCaffrey."
3,"eh, ok",The Belgariad was an awesome series but the first book was at the border line of terrible. It did get very good at the end. Another thing I am dissapointed at is Eddings' vocab. It is 8th grade vocab. He could write a little more advanced. The Mallorean was even better.
4,My Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Research class,"I have to read the first two books of the series and compare them to Star Wars in a comparison/contrast essay. I do not mind the story, but I am boggled by the mass that I have to read in such a short time. The story is good thus far, but such a project is somewhat discouraging from enjoyment of the work."
4,Really Good!,"This book is really well written, and definitely worth spending time on. I enjoyed the plot and the subtle humor. The characters are all well developed, and it is easy to empathize with them. Even though the idea of a quest is somewhat trite, this book does a good job of making the storyline interesting and amusing."
1,What can i say,David Eddings' books are just the thing for those cold winter evenings. You never know when you might run out of kindling. Some people might suggest you read them but unless you want put to sleep by the most tedious nonsense ever written I would avoid it. i found the plot slow and unoriginal and the characters were practically identical. If you want a proper fantasy story Eddings wasn't too bad in the Elenium although I'd go for Ursula LeGuin myself who is capable of getting to the point in a story instead of making 1 page worth of plot last a chapter.
3,A Simple Review for a Simple book.,"I just recently read Pawn of Prophecy for the second time in my life. The last time I read this book was well over fifteen years ago, so it felt like I was reading it again for the first time.While not overly great and somewhat simple storytelling, I did find enjoyment in the story. As the first book of the Belgariad it left me wanting a little bit more, enough so that I felt engaged enough to continue on with the series.While not as complex at A Song of Ice and Fire, it is a good, decent read. If you want something that is very much straight to the point, a solid, simple plot, this book and series is for you. I found that after reading a lot of Lovecraftian fiction, deep involving fantasy and horror. Pawn of Prophecy was a very nice change of pace and brings me back to what I used to enjoy in reading fantasy and that is the adventure."
2,Kindle Edition PLEASE,"If you are looking to read this book on your Kindle, too bad. :(The e-version of this series is not available. This is the Audible edition.I love this series. I first read through the Belgariad back in the 80's.It is definitely one I would love to have on my Kindle. The dog-eared paperback copies on my shelves have been read several times over the years. My guess is that there is a cult following for these books. People will buy these books for their Kindle. Did you hear that Publisher? Low hanging fruit here..."
3,Not quite what I was expecting...,"I don't know if it's the rave reviews for David Eddings, but as for this first installment, I have to say that I'm on the fence. Though I definitely enjoyed the banter among some of the lead characters and the strong hints of stories-within-a-story (like Barak's and Silk's), I've yet to experience that gripping sense of suspense and drama. I was expecting quite a bit more show of magic/sorcery [even if just a teaser] or even one paragraph of heart-pounding adrenaline chase and skirmish (weren't they supposed to be trailed by the enemy?), since other fantasy epics have quite a lot going on even on the first book. It felt like all the ""feeling"" in the book was invested on the Prologue...Of course it's very likely that this need to know more is exactly what drives readers to the next installment. Definitely I'm more than willing to do that myself, I'm just hoping that by the second Book, I would find myself rooting hotly for Belgariad. *cross fingers*"
2,Lost patience with Polgara,"Although I enjoyed the book for the most part, It didn't feel complete: you were left ""hanging"", just like the main character, Garion. Poor chap, no wonder he was frustrated, wouldn't you be,if you knew something was underfoot, but your aunt kept leaving you in suspense? Like Garion, I felt frustrated, and I don't care if I ever read book 2 or 3 ever again."
3,Enjoyable,"..but not quite mythical. But as I learned from the other reviewers, I would have enjoyed it much more 10 years ago (at age 15), and it was written quite a while ago, and was inventive then. So - it's good. The things that bothered me a bit were the how you can tell what's going to happen at every turn, like the music in a horrormovie is playing in the background ""it's going to get scary now!"" :-) and some situations were not very believable (I mean, your galloping on horseback through the night - but can still see how the snow is covering your tracks behind you? no way! it's dark right? and if it were snowing that heavily even in light, you couldn't see that far anyway..), which can interfere with the cinematics in your head :-) If you liked Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series you'll like this. It's a classic, and there's a lot worse fantasy.."
2,Fully developed 2-dimensional characters...,"I'm fascinated with fantasy writing because so little of it is good. Tolkein, of course, and Urusla LeGuin, but beyond that the field falls to hacks ranging from pleasant to truly awful. Eddings is somewhere in the middle between these last two extremes. All of his characters seem to come from old-school children's books (The Noble Thief, the Valiant Warrior, the Uppity Princess) and they fulfill their roles as well as they can, but there is little to develop. The overarching plot of this series is nothing to write home about. The biggest confusion I have is just who he is aiming these books towards. Linguistically and stylistically they are aimed at about a 6th grade reading level, yet he also introduces some heavily suggestive (no real nudity, mind you) scenes as well, along with a few bits of truly graphic violence. My guess it is aimed for adults who can't read beyond a junior high school level. Not a bad book, but certainly not worth remembering."
2,very linear,"I've found with these reviews that people arent very critical. Is this really the best book youve ever read?? Its got that definite, ""they go here, then they go there, then they travel here. etc etc"". Nothing ever really happens. There is only 1 battle in the book which goes for about 10 lines. There is no finale either. Yeah its part of a series, but you still need a climax. The end of the book finishes with the party heading out on the road again (so Im not sure if I want to read the 2nd). There is also no real use of magic either. I dont know how this can be compared to the likes of Gemmell and Feist."
2,Slow start of an epic,I do not exactly know why I read this whole series. Because I did not fancy this first episode. In my opinion there was no logic as to why the group of people followed the route of travel they followed. Furthermore I like a story with several storylines interwoven. This book lacks that for sure. To go short I was not half as impressed as the majority of reviewers overhere. Nevertheless I read through the next volumes and I must say the series improves towards the end. But on average they don't get above three stars.
1,Badly transcribed D&D game,"A hero with a hidden past, a sorceer, a thief, a female characterwho hates the hero, but who will eventually love him? Let's getan elf in there and start playing D&D !!!These books are bad, bad, bad, formulaic nonsense. My only regretis I read them. Eddings cannot hold a candle to Donaldson, Wolfe or even Robert Holdstock.This is truly the stuff that dumbs down fantasy writing.Avoid."
1,"Really, really boring read","I honestly do not even remotely understand the appeal of this book. Everything is totally predictable and the characters are one dimensional and incredibly uninteresting. Not to mention, nothing actually happens in this book - and I mean NOTHING. The entire book is a slow meandering journey which only stops for long repetitive dialogues that do absolutely nothing but take up space. The main character is not only purposely kept in the dark, but Eddings view of women in general is extremely degrading and condescending.I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. Luckily they are short and easily forgotten."
1,Don't become a pawn.,"This book is beyond awful. The setting is stock and does nothing to advance the genre of Fantasy, (probably the opposite), the plot isn't stock, but it is not very efficient in moving the story or keeping the reader's attention. The characters are dreadful. If you can't realize that these characters have no depth, are poorly described, and have no personality traits, then you need to go back to a high school english class. Eddings makes an attempt to write fantasy that is similar to Lord of the Rings, but fails every step of the way. Even if he had succeeded, it has already been done. So, the bottom line is that this is a common fantasy story with no original ideas and paper-thin stock fantasy stereotype characters."
2,Silly adolescent fantasy,"David Eddings commits every sin a writer of fantasy can: there's the wise old all-powerful magician, the big strong warrior, and the boy who is destined to fulfill an ancient prophecy; and not to forget angry Gods who for some reason turn out to be complete nincompoops and allow themselves to be defeated by humans at the end of the series (I'm not considering this a spoiler - this seems obvious). Eddings wrote in his foreword that he wrote this book in order to tackle philosophical issues that bothered him at the time. I don't know what kind of issues he had while writing this, but the deepest philosophical message you can get out of these books is something akin to love conquers all (or of the same type of ""keen"" insight). Might satisfy adolescents, but absolutely NOT for adults. I'm not a fantasy buff but I _know_ there is better fantasy out there - such as that by lord Dunsany and others. Try checking it out when you give up these books."
2,"broad range of styles, photos need better color correcting","Lots of floor plans and cross sections. The photos contain a lot of information however the image/color quality is a bit off - some photos have a green tint to them, others are contrasty. For the price not bad - but better eye to detail would have been appreciated."
3,Single Focus Pamphlet,This 24 page pamphlet by Luther Burbank is exclusively focused on genetic selection as a means of increasing cherry yields and improving fruit characteristics. There is NO content regarding propogation.
4,lunar dragon song,I like this game. It is good for people who like lunar legend. I LOVE LUNAR LEGEND
3,Good game but expected a lot more,"The game overall is good, but, as a Lunar fan, I expected a lot more from this DS title. It's a fresh RPG but many of the elements that made Silver Star Story and eternal Blue amazing are missing here"
2,Lunar...Well it isn't like the silver star or eternal blue...But it is a prequel and fills in some lanks.,"Lunar...Well it isn't like the silver star or eternal blue...But it is a prequel and fills in some blanks. The story is good and fills in some blanks between the other games. The bosses are huge. You can choose to gather items for quests or exp in battle, but not both. The only real bummer was how short thr game was. At level 26 I beat the final boss, but for a quik game it was fun."
2,Not A Great Role Playing Game,Lunar Dragon Song is not your typical Role Playing Game like Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior. This game becomes very repetitive because you have to play it in 2 modes. 1 to get money to buy items and another to raise your levels. You must fight over and over to get anywhere and this is just a waste of time.The major problem in this game for RPG players is you CAN NOT pick the enemy that you want to attack and you usually attack a weak one and not the one that is beating the crap out of you. This is very annoying and makes you want to just stick it on your shelf and forget the money you spent on it. Just another Disappointing Nintendo DS game in my collection.A remake with a few changes would make this a very nice game but as it stands forget it !!!!!
1,Slow and Tedious Loses the Race,"If you were a fan of Lunar 1 and 2, do not play this game and pretend it never existed. The game is slow in all the wrong ways, and punishes players who want to speed things along. Your characters move at a slow crawl, and to move at a somewhat exceptable rate lowers HP. In a game where transportation and resource management are key, this is unforgivable. It is as if the development team made the players not want to progress through the story quickly to pad the number of hours taken to beat the game. It frustrated me in such a short time frame that I returned my copy the next day. I may not have gotten to any redeeming points of interest or plot points further along, but they gave me no reason to stay. There are far better RPGs on DS, so give this title a pass and try something from the Shin Megami Tensei series instead."
3,Now the best Lunar but it will do.,"This game had my attention for a while. Well until i beat it. It was kind of a pain walking EVEYWHERE you had to go. It wasn't like you want through an area once and you could pass through it the next times you went through it on the map but no you want to go in an fight monsters every time. Well I found that collection items was good for the jobs that needed to be done. Jobs were the only real way to get money, other then finding it in a chest. And once you get later in the game armor and weapons cost a pretty penny so save up.All in all I recommend this game to anyone that likes RPG's in general. And if you can get it for under 15 bux then is worth it."
1,Liar 2,"I don't believe anything that was written in this book. I do understand why he would write this book, but I also know that this was the man who was in the car behind Pac and didn't do anything to prevent what was happening from happening. No cooperation at all to bring the murderers to justice. I understand that no one talks to the cops, but the title of the book couldn't be more wrong because he proved to everyone that he in no way had Pac's back."
1,Secularist war?,"The author conveniently neglects the fact that Christmas is already primarily a secularist holiday--Christianity has added only the name of the holiday, manger scenes, and a few of the popular carols. The larger part of the holiday as popularly celebrated, Santa Claus, decorating trees, and exchanging gifts--has nothing at all to do with Jesus or the Bible. If there is a secularist war on Christmas, then how come the only boycotts being threatened are against stores who choose to say ""Seasons Greetings"" and not stores who say ""Merry Christmas."" I would have expected conservatives to allow business owners to choose for themselves what holiday greetings to use."
1,The worst book ever written,Why someone would choose this crap to write is a wonder to me..However it was given to me from my parents..Terribly written..Did this guy finish high school?So much fear in this kooks heart.I cannot imagine Jesus had John Gibson in mind to save a holiday that had nothing to do with him till recently.And calling it a war??A war Mr. Gibson is what is happening in Iraq to our brave men not your idiotic assumptions.Even on amazon some of the right wing nuts writing reviews are again showing the reason Fox news is so big..They appeal to the dumb.And Mr. Gibson fits right in.
1,"Oh, please","As a devout Christian, I have to say that this is, quite possibly, the stupidest book I have ever read in my entire life. The Christian church hasn't been a persecuted minority for almost 2000 years, and the idea that, as Christians, we're somehow being attacked by a ""liberal cabal"" is ridiculous. This book undermines the importance of the seperation of church and state--something that gives all of us, Christians included, the freedom to practice in accordance to our faith. By attacking the First Amendment and, by extension the whole of the Constituion, the author does all Christians and American patriots a disservice. I would give this less than one star if I could."
1,Because you can't give ZERO stars on Amazon.,"Heritage my ass. Mithras, Osiris...where do you think the monomythology for the Jesus story comes from? What's more important for those who claim Christ is God - Paul's take on Christ (which has slack-jawed prokaryotics like the author worried about the story, and takes on the story, as reflected in the Nicene and Apostle's Creeds, or Christ's take on the world, which hinges upon Matthew 22:34-40, and the Greatest Commands to Love (love God, love everyone else you come across, and love one's enemies)?It's interesting how everyone from your current ""President,"" to the author, to those backign the author in these ""reviews"" totally and absolutely ignore Christ in their Christianity, in their BECOMING ""Christ-like.""Astonishing. As for the book itself, its the joke that precedes itself. A permanently amusing and funny indictment of self.That tries to focus us on the 100% absolutely wrong things."
1,Why does Laura Bush hate Christmas & America?!,"Arguing with conservatives with facts (which they seem to have such an aversion to) is much like shooting fish in a barrel. Hey, Kevin Bold, over 90% of Americans are Christian? Try less than 80% (but why quibble over a few TENS of MILLIONS of people, eh?).As for people such as John Gibson, who actually seem to believe that wishing people ""Happy Holidays"" is an affront, nay, an attack upon ""Christmas"" (pagan holiday that it is), I give you the following quotes from First Lady, Laura Bush:""Well, all things bright and beautiful is the theme this year. I think it will be really bright and beautiful with this fabulous tree. But thank you all very much. Happy holidays. I know this is the real start of the season, the Monday after Thanksgiving, and so I want to wish everybody happy holidays.""--source: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051128-1.html"
1,Boring,Forget this book. Have fun this Christmas and don't worry your pretty little head about John Gibson.
1,Media Bias in the War on Christmas,How dare we have the manners to try to include everyone. Good manners are not making others uncomfortable. It is simply good manners to wish someone happy holidays. That is what makes America great complete tolerance for others. You wanna be Iran? Fine let's go all out!!!
1,"Inane, poorly written, a CRAPPY BOOK!",Save your money. This book couldn't be worse if a monkey had written it.
2,Not very well researched but full of opinions and a little bit of nastyness; Christian? WWJD!,"I found this book to be very trivial. If you want support for your thesis that white right wing republicans are a supressed minority, here's your book. I was very surprised that a so called professional journalist was unable to overcome his own strong bias to make his case via actual data. I used to believe that a journalist used a fact driven flow chart to prove ideas. Fox news fair and what? And by the way, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club are playing actual Christmas music with belief driven lyrics that reflect the Christian portion of the Holiday Season. I find the commercialization and over sell of Christmas an affront to my Christian beliefs.Again WWJD..."
1,Pathetic clap-trap,"It is 'fool some of the people all of the time'time again. Just in time to help celebrate that most capitalistic of holidays, a half baked ""reporter"" whines about half truths and spreads more Fox lies. Fox is more dedicated to the end of a holiday for the ""The Prince of Peace"" than the victims of Gibson's sloppy research."
1,Very Christian of you Mr. Gibson,"Hmmm how I can create more fear and hate... I know I will ""write"" a book on how Christmas is stolen from us christians. I don't care if I share the USA with people with other views because as we all know, if the liberals step up and voice their concerns then should be shipped out of country!I got another idea... the pilgrims left because everybody was laughing at there puritan values. Why don't the extreme right get on a boat and sail for there new Nirvana. A place where if you disagree with a thought, then that ""evil doer"" can be ""eliminated"". Pat Robertson can be your captain... happy sailing!"
1,Great for Laughs! Should be in the humor section!,"Wow, this book is hysterical. If you ever wondered if Fox News was biased or slanting their news, all you have to do is read this book. I can't really picture Wolf Blitzer coming out with a book that says, ""Why the Republicans Want To Murder The Easter Bunny."""
1,"Greed, Oppression and Pieity (false) garbage",The only things that seperates the good folk of the US from the battling bro's of Northern Ireland is the seperation of church and state.Dear Lord please protect us from these your hateful followers.
1,Just more hate,"I have to be honest, I have not read the book, I do read his column on the internet almost every day, so I have a picture of what the book is like.Christian nation? who are these people that still think this? dont they go out? cant they see that the USA is a very diverse country?They talk about freedom and at the same time say that if you dont like the Christian beliefs of the USA you should get out, COME ON! thats not freedom, thats opression!Anyway, will not buy this trash."
1,Terrible,"The ""War on Christmas"" conspiracy was started by anti-semites in this country who believed, like the Nazis, that there was a Jewish world conspiracy. John Gibson fits perfectly into this category along with Bill O'Reilly and the rest of the conservatives who believe that there is a war on Christianity in general. Anyone who goes to shopping malls knows that the Christmas season is starting earlier and earlier every year. Speaking as a Christian who celebrates and loves Christmas, I believe that the real threat to Christmas is the overbearing consumerism invading our society and the conservatives in power who profit from it."
1,This is false hype and flawed premise,"I couldn't believe that this idiot could churn out a whole book based on such nonsense. ""war on christmas""? Are you kidding me? The tinsel comes out right after Halloween. The stores start playing out the ""o holy night"" and ""Jingle Bell Rock"" 24/7 from that time on. It's the single biggest engine of the US economy. To cite a few tired examples of not promoting Christmas with *public* funds and on *public* property makes him look incredibly stupid. The rest of the country is aware that this is phony outrage. If he wants to move to a place with a state-sponsored religion,,if he want to go to place where any inclusiveness is deemed as offensive as he thinks it is, he should go to afghanistan and live in the theocracy he seems to admire, What an idiot. If amazon allowed, I'd give him 0 stars instead of 1."
1,Where are the supporting reviews?,"Is it just me, or does it seem like all of the reviews in praise of this book are actually parodies?I look forward to Gibson's next book: How Liberals are out to Ban Chocolate and Institute Mandatory Puppy-Kicking."
1,What an interesting piece of paranoia,"And that my friends, is where reality ends.This is nothing but a book from the religiously overzealous who are so scared that their precious belief system is collapsing that they feel the need to spark more fear within its circle to keep the money rolling in.This is a shocking piece to read. If you thought Sean Hannity's views were skewed, you should pick up this nutshell.It's time people got over themselves and tolerated the fact that not everyone wants to think like everybody else. We are all different. If this is the true face of religion, you can keep it.Please people. Save your money. This is nothing but pure fiction and has no basis in reality. Kind of like Christmas really when you think about it."
1,Pure trash,"This is unbelievable. Gibson is running a diversion for Bush; it's no consequence this book is published as Bush's popularity hits rock bottom. This is a flagrant attempt to divert attention from real issues such as the war in Iraq, and domestic spying on disidents by our own government. Those buying tis book are grasping at straws trying to keep their fail in a regime whose corruption is becoming clearer by the day. The radical right will read it, and the rest of us will laugh at it and throw it in the trash."
1,"Good for the ""I Hate Liberals"" crowd","An entire niche industry has been built from authors writing books that bash liberals.It doesnt matter if such books contain factual content; they simply need titles like ""The War on Christmas: How the Liberal Plot to Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought.""Hey, if Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Bernard Goldberg, and Bill O'Reilly can make tons of money pandering to their readers' base instincts, lesser knowns like John Gibson deserve a crack at the money pile generated by this growth industry, too."
1,Journalism or Michael Moore-ism,"My interest in this book ebbed when I saw the ""How the Liberal plot to ban..."" portion of the title. What first sounded like an intriguing look into Christmas under fire, now looks like the author's personal agenda. I'll move on, thanks."
5,HATRED TOWARDS CHRIST & HIS HOLIDAY,"Christians shouldn't be too surprised at this, for Jesus predicted it: The world will hate you because you are not of the world (their anti-God worldview).What does surprise us and Gibson exposes is this hatred coming out now by the lawyers and school teachers in unconstitutional forms such as banning word ""Christmas"" from school holiday calendars.It's ""truth vs. tolerance"" and the only ones being asked to compromise their practice of truth is Christians.Such anti-God bias and hatred continues to flame much litigation and turmoil in our midst, caused by liberal groups such as ACLU, teachers' unions, etc.This is focused exposure of the same as David Limbaugh published in ""Persecution: How Liberals Are Waging War Against Christianity.""To those who say there is no war being waged, they are either biased already, or do not want to look at the evidence."
1,Tough Guy Gib,"John Gibson is a hack. A terrible writer, a pathetic historian, and probably worst of all, an intellectual coward. There are reasons he's a shill on Fox, all of which play to his ability to tow the corporate line. His musing play to nubby dropouts who search TV for moral answers, and that alone should steer anyone with half a brain away from his drivel."
1,You can't be a country club and repressed at the same time.,"I am so sick of 'Christians' whining about how they are repressed in American society. And at the same time they are telling everybody that they belong to an exclusive little club that guarantees their entrance into heaven.I've got news for you, Gibson - this crap just won't fly anymore. Quit whining about how 'Christians' are oppressed. I'd love to have tax free status, huge buildings, multimillion dollar houses and compounds like so many of the 'Christian' right have. That doesn't sound like repression to me.BTW, you right wingers who think you're 'Christian'?? Read the words of Christ. What's his emphasis? Love your neighbor, feed the poor, clothe and shelter the homeless, love your neighbor, don't just, feed the poor, and oh, help each other. Which is, of course, the exact opposite of what the Republican party has done to this country."
1,More Lies From The Religious Right,"Typical Religious Right rant, with no facts and zero understanding about the Establishment Clause.The ACLU and others are not ""banning Christmas"", they are just ensuring that schools do not establish Christianity as a state-sponsored religion.Nobody is going to take away your Christmas tree, you stupid rednecks."
1,Rednecks and Yahoos Will Love This!!,This book is complete bunk! Only simpletons would believe anything in this book! Buy a book that has some truth in it instead of this slop!!!
1,The war on Christmas,"Christmas is not a National Holiday in this country. There are no decorated trees as there were in the Bible. And our Biblical santa oh wait santa and merry christmas and christmas trees are not in the Bible. Carl Rove has an evil imagination and Gibson is one of his shills. Now is the time to read or reread ""1984"""
1,The Disappearing Holiday,"I've noticed how Christmas is shrinking in America. They used to put those decorations out and crank up the carols - and please, do, tell me one Christmas carol that doesn't talk about the baby Jesus - right after the Fourth of July. Now they actually wait until after Halloween! I ask you, what is becoming of Christianity in this country that Walmart doesn't start playing ""Little Drummer Boy"" in their stores until practically November? Someone hasn't been vigilant - Christmas is only 4 months long now! Damn liberals - it should be at least 6 months. And all that secular stuff they use to decorate with - angels and shepherds - what do they have to do with the Little Baby Jesus? It should be just Little Baby Jesus, everywhere, for at least 6 months every year. And don't you dare say ""Happy Holidays"" to me."
1,Were's The Christ?,"The cover of this book reveals the breathtaking idiocy of both author and premise. Of all the symbols associated with the Yuletide season, the tree itself is the most Pagan! Shoving a spruce up the butt of some poor angel doesn't change that - nor, I suspect, endear you to any such being!But this book is a must for fans of unintential self parody. Give one to all your Jewish, Neopagan and Athiest friends today!It is also a must for any Christian friends who have not yet considered the source of this silliness. If they know their Bibles at all - they will know from Whom this comes."
4,Great Book! Ignore reviews of people who obviously have not read it!,"This book was really fascinating and gave a glimpse into the liberal agenda's take on Christmas and Christians. The book is somewhat small, but leaves you guessing that the incidents written about are only a handfull of happenings across the country. The author is sometimes repetitive, but overall makes a clear and concise argument.Another thing: it is very clear that a lot of the reviews have been written by people who only read the title of the book (and not the book itself!) and got offended. This is basically the premise of the book! The book shows how people (aka in this book, liberals who are anti-Christian) hyper-analyze simple situations they feel can only be resolved in court.The only way to draw your own conclusion is to read the book itself, not just the title."
1,Shut up John Gibson,"Ohhhh.... that felt good. Anyway, what's wrong with saying Happy Holidays? It's not a particularly new secular trend that's undermining the ""Christian"" day of ""Christmas"". A bunch of the other reviewers covered the whole Pagan thing, so I don't need to. I don't think Happy Holidays is particularly offensive. The ""Happy Holidays"" refer to multiple holidays: Christmas, New Year's Day... those two, just those. Ergo, lumping both holidays into one phrase is just more sensical, concise, and it gets me to where I need to be faster. It could be much worse than John Gibson is blowing it up to be. Sooooooo.... shut up, John Gibson."
1,Paranoiac Junk,"I always thought Bill O'Lie-lly was the Joseph McCarthy of my generation, but this man comes pretty close. If you're interested in true investigative, objective reporting stay as far away from this rant as possible. It's utter nonsense containing mostly individual assumptions disguised as fact with no backup whatsoever. The fact the author is a Fox news channel staffer makes this diatribe even less palatable where, in fact, the book gets its majority coverage. Hopefully this one won't make it into many Christmas stockings.Perhaps as a yuletide log though."
1,Don't you mean the war on Yule?,"I find it ironic that right-wing fanatics like Gibson are screeching about how Christmas is being stolen when they stole it in the first place. The trees, the wreaths, the feasts, the caroling, the exchanges of gifts--these were all Pagan Yule traditions conveniently lifted by Christians before they thought anyone would notice. Some of us, however, haven't forgotten. So before you begin ranting about how Christianity is being removed from Christmas, consider this: the traditions being bickered over were never Christian to begin with."
1,"the poor persicuted christians. gibson's a wanker, whiner","95% of the U.S.A. celebrates christmas. in a land of about 350 million people, you will always a few who are overly P.C.just being jerks. it doesn't mean we are under attack. fox news has been devoting alot of time promoting this book. left wing news sites have debunked most of the stories as false, going as far as going to the various cities under question, only to find gibson is a liar. right winger will have this book next to the bibles. if the paper stock was higher quality, i could use it to wipe my behind with."
1,Hyperbole and Hysterics,"I felt inspired to write this review since James Ray -- the Catholic apologist who's fond of dressing in Indiana Jones knock-off utility vests -- said anyone writing a 1* review of this book must be a liberal secularist.Actually, I'm just a reader who appreciates properly researched, documented, and argued political discussion. Instead, what we have here are garrulous, self-important anecdotes supposedly indicative of a massive cultural zeitgeist out to persecute Christians in America. The dark, evil cabal of the Secular Elite have amassed all of their resources for one insidious purpose: to stop you from saying ""Merry Christmas"". According to our writer, it's not just a skirmish, a conflict, it's a *war*. Cue the hysterics! Man the canons!Honestly, the one thing to recommend this book is its case study in self-righteousness compared with paranoia. Don't worry, you can still say ""Merry Christmas"". I'm not your mortal enemy because I happen not to say it."
4,The War on Christmas,If you don't believe what the book covers it shows you are standing in the shadows.
1,Church on every corner,I know when I see a church on every street corner in America and 5 24 hr Christian stations . Then I know for sure that christianity is indeed under attack. How do the christians survive?
2,Some interesting thoughts but missing the point,"John Gibson clearly feels strongly about the topic of his latest book. So strong he -in my opinion- shows signs of tunnel vision in his discourse. This left me with the idea I'd been reading a very shallow, mono-sighted paper, sometimes even on the edge of insulting various groups in our vulnerable society.Of course, Mr. Gibson is not a novelist or scholar but still, with just a minimum of efford by the author a more readable and perhaps more interesting piece of work could have been produced."
1,christmas,"As long as those stinking liberals keep their hands off of Festivus, I don't really care. But they'll have to pry my Festivus pole out of my cold, dead hands."
1,Yet Another Extremist Fantasy,"Extremists of all stripes tend to mix fact and fantasy, and see boogeymen under every bed. This book is a perfect example of the far right's version of the boogeyman. Others have debunked the contents sufficiently and adequately that I need not say any more."
1,Yet another paranoid conspiracy theory,Start with an absurd premise and conclude with a paranoid delusion and you end up with a book like this.
1,Jesus won't be born if you don't act now to save Christmas...,"....just send 5 easy payments of $39.95 to the author, and he will personally save Christmas just for you. And I don't mean the fake, Victorian holiday, either. We're going for a true, infallible, biblical Christmas. One where you'll be sitting out in a field watching over your flocks by night and traipsing off to a squallid stable to visit a baby in rags.C'mon, people, help us put ""Christ""mas back into the ""Christ""ian church, where it belongs."
1,Please save us all,"I can't believe they killed trees to make this ""book"". Anyone who believes there is a war on Christmas is out of their mind. Instead of wasting your money on this crap, give to the Hurricane Katrina relief fund. There your money is going somewhere worthwhile, instead of John Gibson's already overpaid fist"
1,total nonesense,"I would have preferred to give the book no stars. I didn't buy it, but I read quite a bit of it in a book store.Gibson obviously wrote this book to make a buck from the far right evangelical Christians. The winter holiday season runs from Thanksgiving to New Years. Not everybody in this country is a Christian, and many who say they are, are actually quite secular. Only one day in the season is Christmas. To encourage people to blackball stores for what their employees say to customers, or what their banners say is ridiculous and against freedom of speech."
1,Do these people read?,"Sometimes I wonder. I mean, if they read this, they couldn't possibly believe it. Then again, I guess the sort of person this appeals to isn't really driven by facts or the power of the argument, but on whether or not confirms their biases."
2,DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!,"Christmas is actually in invention by the Communists for the express purpose of undermining america! Did you know Santa Claus is actually a Russian creation? That's right! Not only that, why do you think that he wears red colors? It is nothing short of an insidious plot to glorify the colors of the old Kremlin! Yes, Jolly old St. Nick is a spy who has been working for the commies and the red chinese for many years. He undermines capitalist economies by a mass re-distribution of wealth every Christmas Eve. And the most insidious part is that he is using books like this one to push his bolshevik agenda under the guise of Christianity. Most insidious!"
1,Tell Rudolph to Guide your Sleigh to Church,"If I want to see a play about a pregnant Jewish girl having a baby out of wedlock, I can do it at church. Plus I'd rather be there to explain to my kids such concepts as the immaculate conception, which I think public school teachers are ill equipped to handle (especially if they spend the last period on the abstinence only sex-ed curriculum). Not even us church going types think our public school educated kids need to spend the entire month of December celebrating a holiday that not all of them celebrate anyway. War my halo and wings."
1,"Lord, save us from your followers.","First, Christians impose Christmas on Secular Society, blowing it in everyone's face like so much cigarette smoke. Next, they complain the Holiday has become secular... and they blame non-Christians. Of course we shouldn't expect much from a Cult that worships a Jewish Hippie. Remember, the war on the war on christmas is there to distract you all from Republican Corruption and Scandals."
1,Mouth Breathers,"I actually 'skimmed' this epic during a visit to Borders. My own opinion is that this is simply an easy way for John Gibson, the 'Mouth Breather' to grab a few extra HOLIDAY greenbacks. Complete trash and utter nonsense. I'm actually ashamed that I'm taking the time to write this. This book (sic) is nothing more that an effort to grab a few bucks and pump up ratings for FOX. Barely disguised anti-semitism, an appeal to rightist wingnuts and the barely sentient will always let you grab a quick sheckle or two.I was amused to read one reviewer complain about the large number of liberal customers at Amazon. Well...uh... yes, those of us who live in a reality based world DO tend to read more then those in the Bizarro world of the ultra right wing freepers and fundie crazies.John: Here's a cookie: Now go stand in the corner and be quiet."
1,Wow,"From Wikipedia:Heath LedgerOn 23rd January 2008 following the announcement of the death of actor Heath Ledger, Gibson opened his show with funeral music and used an audio quote of Ledger saying the line ""I wish I knew how to quit you"", taken from the movie Brokeback Mountain, and commented ""Well, he knew how to quit you!"" Laughing, Gibson then played another clip from Brokeback Mountain in which Ledger said, ""We're dead,"" followed by his own, mocking ""We're dead"" before playing the clip again. Throughout the course of the show, Gibson continued to bring up Ledger's death, jokingly claiming that current events may have caused him to commit suicide, suggesting that Ledger killed himself because he had ""a serious position in the (stock) market"" or perhaps ""watched the Clinton-Obama debate last night. I think he was an Edwards guy, cause he saw his Edwards guy was just completely irrelevant.""[4]. He also referred to Ledger as ""a weirdo"" with a ""serious drug problem""."
1,"Conspiracy to ""subvert"" our most sacred holiday?","The very title of this book is absurd. This is the most sacred holiday only if you are a Christian. If you are a Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jew, Sikh or any of the other religions that billions of people on this planet follow or the millions of people in this country follow for that matter, then of course your most sacred holiday is probably something else. Why is this so hard to understand?Naturally this is about something else entirely. Anyone with even a reasonable amount of insight or intelligence can figure this out."
1,boring and dumb,"i could not even get half-way thru this book. it is unorganized, random, and just plain boring. gibson's arguments are weak, and do more to expose his extreme christian right-wing agenda than to actually present rational arguments. regardless of your opinion on this issue, the book will bore you to death."
1,"Hey Fellow Christian, Let's Go Shopping!","The intellectual bankruptcy of this latest and silliest entry in the Christian Victimization sweepstakes is revealed on its cover: The symbol that best represents this sacred holiday is ... a gaudily decorated tree?!!Meanwhile ""liberal"" is purposely conflated with ""secularist"" to engender maximum outrage. Add in a few baseless accusations punctuated *liberally* with scare words from the Victims' Lexicon (""plot"", ""ban""), et voila -- instant jeremiad.Feh."
1,What war on Christmas?,"John ""Fox News Filler"" Gibson takes Bill O'Reilly's talking points from last Christmas and manages to craft, yet another, foolish book that no one important will read or care about. I read the first two chapters at a local bookstore and wondered how such a squirrely-looking albino ever made it on television and was able to convince some dimwitted publishers to release such an inept literary debacle. War on Christmas? What the hell is this guy talking about? A couple of elementary schools now celebrate the ""holidays"" instead of Christmas, and John Gibson cries like a little girl. Hey John, stop trying to be Bill O'Reilly. There's only room for one. What a joke. If you have any interest in buying this book, just wait until it hits the bargain bin. Don't worry, you won't have to wait long."
1,This is a joke....right?,"Oh, come on! This is what FOX News has their ""crack"" journalists working on, huh? And of course, liberals, (or non-neocons) are to blame. When the American people can pry themselves away from the spoon-feeding sessions on ALL networks (cable included, especially), only then, may the ""leadership"" in this country be un-masked. CELEBRATE AS YOU LIKE, NO ONE CARES!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,As a veteran in the war to save Christmas...,"I have to say that this book got me through some dark days on the battlefield. Just thinking about those liberals, and their ""happy holidays"" and ""where were the WMDs"" and their ""100,000+ Iraqis have died for nothing"" makes me fear for the safety of my country.My only comfort is the knowledge that Jesus will smite them down on Judgement Day - don't let liberals tell you ""love thy neighbor"" applies to any one who doesn't donate money to the Republican party!"
1,Who Would Jesus Divide,"John Gibson has every right as an American to author and publish whatever his corporate fascist boss- FOX's Rupert Murdoch- desires him to. Fortunately, we still have every right to reject him.I could never imagine the Jesus I believe in using this cherished season to threaten, demand, and divide us.Jesus is all about sharing, family and setting aside differences.This is Jesus' true ""Reason for the Season""."
1,Absolutely Pitiful,"You all remember the War on Christmas last year, don't you?Nationwide bannings of Nativity scenes, people who mentioned Jesus got locked up, etc etc.This is the most pitiful, bottom of the barrel, right-wingnut talking point I've heard in my lifetime. I'm a liberal Democrat who celebrates Christmas with all the enthusiasm of an 8-year-old. (Hint: that's a fair amount of enthusiasm, especially if Legos are involved)Save yer money!"
5,"These aren't reviews, they're votes","Since few of the reviewers have read the book, they are voting, not reviewing. So I'm adding my vote, since I like John Gibson and believe he is correct that there is a war on Christmas and all things Christian."
1,Joh Gidson is just like Jesus!,"I neverd did read me his book, but i heard Bil O'relly tokking about this too! So i no its true!!! God bless Jon Gidson and Bil O'relly, and god bless presdent Bush too. Dont let the liburls take our Chrismas away and dont let them take Jesus away!"
3,Self righteous people make me sick.,"""Nubby uneducated Dolts who don't work and have nothing to do but watch Foxnews""....? Is this how I'm seen by the opposition?This Stanford PhD is so very happy to see this. I'm glad to be underestimated.. even dismissed.The left's continuing superciliosity gives reasonable people an advantage at the polls. Keep it up.AR"
1,this book sux,"What a retarted book. Jesus Christ, is this the biggest issue we have to worry about? Gibson needs to get over it. i am an atheist and i dont nessisarily like the word ""god"" in the Pledge of Alliegence at school. but i dont really care that much and i am not going to get in an uproar about it. Stop being so uptight about stupid things that dont matter.-plus i always thought that the term ""happy holidays"" was partially created to include christmas with new years and other holidays as a marketing plan. Is the right wing against the economy and capitalism? Why do they hate America?"
1,The War on the Truth,"How FOX News uses Fear and Paranoia to Further Divide America.Just when you think that the Crap Factory that is FOX News could stink no worse, this steaming pile hits the shelves.Happy Holidays"
1,Shameful and Un-American,"This book should be titled: The War on Americans and How the Conservative Plot to Ignore the Democratic Process is Worse Than You Thought.Save your money and donate it to charity, instead."
1,Puerile and Trite,"The entire book is nothing but the same baseless rhetoric that Mr. Gibson spouted while on The Fox News Channel. There never was , is, or ever will be a war on Christmas. This is nothing more than a fantasy cooked up by ultra conservatives who are angry that the United States is changing and they may have to see and hear from those they disagree with."
1,Unimpressed,"I read this book wondering of there was really any meat to the whole ""war on christmas"" hysteria, but there is next to nothing of real substance in the book. Gibson's book is essentially a 186 page pamphlet. It's largely anecdotal, offering almost no cites to back up anything. No footnotes, no endnotes, and most irritatingly, he makes reference to lawsuits without citing the civil docket number or even the venue, so good luck with your fact checking. On 12/20, Bill O'Reilly went on the air retracted his claim, which also appears in Gibson's book, that the Plano Independent School District banned red and green clothing."
1,Happy Holidays!,"I think the most telling thing about this book (and the people reviewing it) is all the comments about people not being able to say 'Merry Christmas' for fear that the ACLU will slap them with a lawsuit.News Flash: The ACLU would be more likely to sue for your right to NOT be oppressed for expressing your religious preference. We have the right to free speech, remember? The ACLU defends peoples' rights.Separation of church and state means that governments can't endorse one religion over another. Store workers can say 'Merry Christmas' without fear of THE ACLU CRACKIN' DOWN!!!!!, but any store that says they can't says that because their BOSS has told them to do so, for fear of offending anyone. Not because of ACLU threats.The ACLU is not evil. They just want EQUAL rights for EVERYONE."
1,"This is a joke, right?","The War on Christmas: How the Right Wing Plot to Enrage Lazy Brainless FOX Viewers and Distract Them from Their Worsening Economic Situation, Another American Quagmire Of A War That is Bankrupting the Nation, Killing its Youth and Was Based On Jingoism and Lies, AND giving them a Scape Goat to Focus All Their Misplaced Hate and Vitriol At.... Is Worse Than You Thought.The book is worse than you thought too."
1,The best thing about this book? The cover.,"I liked the cover illustration quite a bit. Unfortunately for me I didn't browse the book before reading it. Fortunately for me, I got it from my library and therefore didn't waste a dime.I saw this Gibson guy interviewed and the idea sounded interesting. The book, however, is one of those fact-slim pieces that relies on a few anecdotes. I always find this annoying and simple-minded. Anyone - ANYONE - could write a book making any point if they rely on a small handfull of hand-picked anecdotes, becuase you can find a few to cover virtually any topic.Not sure if I'll read any of his other books, but this one was a huge disappointment, and, frankly, pretty intellectually lazy.But I did like the cover."
1,War on Christmas=ANTISEMITISM,"Why is that every year between Thanksgiving and New Years Day common sense flies right out the window thanks to the hysterical ramblings of John Gibson and the rest of the Fox News Jackals, guaranteed to whip up anti-semitic fervor for big ratings? Obviously Gibson isn't going to be truly satisfied until there's a nice Yuletide pogrom in the streets, just like in Europe years and years ago.I don't know what planet Gibson is living on. Liberals, Gibson's favorite scapegoat, is really a code word for Jews. No one is fooled by these dyspeptic scribblings--Christmas is alive and well--just go to any mall between now and December 24th. Why even President Bush sent out the generic Happy Holidays on all the Xmas cards the White House sent out. Take your anti semitism, John, and stick it where the sun don't shine you anti-semitic Moron!Personally I think January 2nd should be declared a national holiday. It's called Life Gets Back To Normal Day."
1,Load of Crap,"My folks got this one for me. What a waste of time and money, I'm wondering if I can take it back to a store and get the money back? If not I could use it to get my Yule Log started."
1,oh my...what did our country become?,"what a waste...this book is just a long (uninteresting) hate speech.if you're an ignorant racist who wants to hijack this country and turn it into a neo-con/fascist nation, then, this book is for you because clearly, gibson speaks to idiots only. otherwise...shame, shame, shame...but the biggest tragedy here is that gibson is a ""journalist.""just plain sad..."
1,Wrong war at the wrong time,"I am pro-Christmas, but for me Gibson twisted facts and did not go far enough to close the sale."
1,Pure Craziness,Wow... I think the title of the book does enough talking over how wacky this dude is.
2,This book is worse than I thought too!,"While there are about 9 interesting ideas and points to be made in this book, the author meanders, re-capitulates, and otherwise engages in ""repetative redundancy"", presumably in order to turn a short article into a full length book that can be sold.I wish I had the ""Readers Digest"" version of the book, because I think the 9 points are particularly relevant; I just have trouble finding them amongst the drivel."
1,President Bush and Republican National Committee join the war on Christmas!!,"President Bush and the Republican National Committee have joined the war on Christmas. Here's a link to the RNC & Bush family holiday card --http://www.au.org/pdf/HolidayCard05.pdfNote that it does not say ""Merry Christmas,"" rather gives ""best wishes for a holiday season of hope and happiness."" On the front is a drawing of the White House showing the Bush family pets in the snow. No manger, no Holy Family, not even a wreath. ""Holiday season""? ""Best wishes?"" Why no mention of the baby Jesus? Where's the Christ in Christmas? There is even a small quote from the OLD Testament (i.e., no Jesus). Why do the Bushes hate Jesus? Why is Bush promoting this war on Christmas? Why aren't they covering this on Fox News? How do Gibson and O'Reilly feel about this gross promotion of secularism by the Bushes paid for by the RNC? Why do Republicans hate Christmas?"
1,Offensive and Unreadable,"I sat down with this book and was unable to finish it. The notion that anyone interested in enforcing the idea of the separation of church and state is therefore ""anti-Christmas"" is ludicrous and patently offensive. Gibson is tacitly approving cultural McCarthyism in this book. If you are liberal and hate America so much that you see the wisdom behind not forcing non-Christian children to participate in the Passion Play, then according to this book you are anti-Christmas and therefore part of the problem.Disgusting."
1,The War on Christmas,"Save your money! Disgusting book from a disgusting person - a Faux ""news"" dissembler...may I recommend ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"" by Al Frankin? Or ""The Sorrows of Empire"" by Chalmers Johnson?"
3,"Good, but does not go far enough","I thought the book was a fair assesment of the war on Christmas, as I myself have witnessed Christmas Tree lots set ablaze and tie-dyed hippies stealing candy canes from children. I had long suspected this must be some kind of organized plot.But Mr. Gibson does not address an issue that is much more important to me, and that is the plot to take the ""Saint"" out of Saint Nicholas. I am outraged at all the crass commercialism surrounding the good Saint. I've even seen department stores where you can have your children photographed with ""Santa Claus"". This is a direct assault on my Catholic upbringing and nothing is being done about this blasphemy. Christmas is not about commerce, but Jesus' message of helping poor people. I am sure a fine Christian such as Mr. Gibson will be delighted to donate all the proceeds to the Empty Stocking Fund.http://www.emptystockingfund.org/"
1,not just liberals,"Even right wingers are getting in on the action to secularize Christmas. I recently read where Harriet Miers dropped the word 'Christmas' from Bush's White House Christmas card! Interestingly, Gibson didn't include this in his skewed book."
1,"I, for one, am outraged",Christians have stolen the Sacred holiday of Saturnalia and it's about time we took a stand and took it back!Io Saturnalia! May Saturn bless and keep you!
1,1 star is more than enough,"Are you kidding me? This man is creating a tempest in a teapot. He knows that his far, far, far radical right followers will trip over themselves to buy, read and beat others over the head with this book. This is not a new argument, it has been going on for generations. Yet Gibbson thinks by releasing this book -- that is far from the spirit of the holiday -- is fresh thinking. How sad for a man with an education to be so stupid.There is no war on Christmas... and to be perfectly honest, I know that the Jesus I believe in would be appalled at Mr. Gibson's book."
1,Retailers are the biggest threat to the spirit of Christmas,"with putting an emphasis on shopping. Christmas is about the birth of Jesus and EVERYTHING he taught not the latest video game.But John chooses to pick on Jews, Buddists, Jahova Witnesses who don't celebrate Christmas and share this great country with us."
1,Unpleasant read,Not a well written book. Very angry unkind comments. Sounds like author needs to work on his own Christian values...this book doesn't work... Perhaps if John Gibson had penned this book as a loving Christian man...people would have heard what he was trying to say. Instead he seems to have a personal issue that he needs help with...Merry Christmas Mr Gibson..may your heart open for you to find peace. You seem to have missed the sacred teachings of Jesus Himself..
1,A whole book based on a fallacious premise?,"In this case, bias is definitely in the eye of the beholder -- what a complete waste of paper and print -- definitely not worth reading. I would have given this treatise zero stars, if that had been possible."
1,More neo-con biased Junk,More junk. Liberals want to get rid of Christmas. What an insane idea for a book. I read the first chapter while on line at the book store and was so bored that I put it back from where I stumbled upon this dopey thing. The author needs to get a life.
3,"Should be titled ""War on Christianity""","Although Gibson could have written a longer book with more insight into the entire anti-christian movement, he was trying to stick to one topic. This work shows how blatant and discernible the radicals have become in their ""war"" against anything they disagree with. Especially when it comes to pushing their views on Republicans and Democrats alike. Informative reading but not too deep."
1,Are you serious?,"With all the REAL problems facing the people of this country I cannot believe that John Gibson wasted time writing this book. ""The War on Christmas""? Give me a break!"
5,This band rocks!,"I was a huge Pinhead fan, and just recently started going to see LMD shows. And they are just full on in your face rock. Easily one of the best bands in Colorado, and they are going places. I've seen them blow nationals off the stage over and over again.Get this CD, see there show. You'll thank yourself later."
3,wait a cotton pickin' minute...,"This '04 ZYX release is identical to Disc 1 of the '05 Manifold release Ibiza Chill Box, Vol.2 - for roughly the same price! (at the time of this writting) Sooooo... why buy this when you can get 2 more discs and 28 additional tracks? and by the way, the music? i'd call this new age/smooth jazz(so smooth it's flat!) not chill. beats are limp. melodies(??) are starkly ethereal. no edge, no groove, if you run out of ambien (sleep aid) this'll do right nicely!"
1,Nothing but 50's style modernism,"I'm not sure why I got this magazine but I really wish I hadn't. I've gotten three issues now and each one has been nothing but 1950's style modernism. I would hate to live in any of the houses they review. I find them all cold, miserable and most uncomfortable."
4,Great,"This book provides a foundation to understand relationships.The inclusion of many psychological theories as well as literature provide great thought provocation.I think you would definately be able to take something away from this book. If nothing else (even if you don't subscribe to any of the theories), it definately delivers a way of discussing relationships.I can;t see any way thay someone could not apply some of the theory to either past present or future.I ended up highlighting many meaningful paragraphs that I can use/refer to.I Love the book and recommend it!"
2,Photo image is misleading,"I ordered four of the 6.5"" wheel chocks. The photo image depicts a mounting plate, whereas the item that is being shipped does not have the mounting plate, but two small mounting disks. Ended up cancelling the order."
5,A Must Have,"Whether you are a long time Dave Alvin fan, or only recently started listening to his music, King of California is a must have for your collection. Great CD!"
5,One of the best folk albums of the 1990s,"King of California is Dave Alvin's career-defining moment. Some songs are slowed-down versions of his old Blasters material (Border Radio, Bus Station), others are from his days in X or early solo ablums. Somewhere along the line Dave learned how his songs should be sung. This is no knock to Phil Alvin, the lead singer for the Blasters. It's just the truth. This album's is Dave's Highway 61 Revisited, and one of the best folk albums of the 1990s. It's sonic poetry."
3,not what expected for money,"I ordered this because I thought it would be a nice collection in box and unopened, but it wasn't. I received four movies, two already opened and two packaged. No nice box as a ""collection. I could have bought all the movies separate for almoat half the price! I bought because I was expecting more than just single opened movies. All the movies were included but not what was expected or how it was presented in the one picture provided."
3,Arabic Influences on Kiswahili,"I was in Kenya years ago and asked some Kenyans if they were speaking Arabic(my kiswahili is that limited). They proceeded to enlighten me that the Arab traders had a huge linguistic and cultural influence on many tribes in Kenya as well as other regional parts of Africa where they traded. It continues to this day.I wish, at the very least, Amazon could procure a copy for their online ""look inside this book"" so we would have access to indeces, etc...I would be interested in purchasing this book for more thorough research. It is very interesting how languages evolve through such influences, usually as a result of trade and other economics.Amazon needs to obtain ""lost books"" or other books that are ""out of print"" or ""unavailable."" Amazon could promote their image as THE IDEAL book seller if it went slightly out of its way to procure such rare commodities such as this book."
5,A Natural Miracle,"When my father's knee aches and pain pills don't help...my friend's osteoarthritis kicks up in her foot... or I have muscle strains that keep me awake, this penetrating, soothing rub does the trick. No kidding.It's not just for feet. It keeps your skin supple and smooth, too. When I go to their wonderful cabins store near my home in Western Maryland, I often find the owners in the basement, compounding more cream! I buy enough for friends who ask for it in my other home, San Diego. It works."
4,Affordable quality shocks.,"I bought a set of these for the front of my 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis which was in serious need of replacements. The GR-2 shocks have greatly improved the handling, giving the car a much more secure feeling of directional control. I would have given the shocks 5 stars, but the supplied washers and rubber cushioning grommets are not as robust as the original equipment. In my situation, I had to add a couple additional washers before the top nut in order to get the proper snugness before the top nut reached the end of the threads. The shocks are working great now so I don't have any real complaint about them at this point."
4,a must have,"this is a great single,if ur a singer like myself then u would understand why im sooooo excited.im very good at doing immitation singing and even tho it was easy for me to sing sense ive been singing for awhile(especially to mariah),i believe it was a little more challenging album.if ur a fan like i am and r set on getting her collection,act now.this will definetly go soon."
5,Hero 2000,"Shes always included one feel-good-about-yourself track on every album shes released. Like 'Make it happen' from 'Emotions', and 'Hero' from 'Music Box', this single tells you all about keeping your dignity alive and burning within. Its beautiful, though the video with Mariah weeping all over the place looks a little contrived.This song reminded me of Houston's 'The greatest love of all' which was my favorite track of the 80s. Mariah's attempts at being the 00's keep-it-together queen seem to be paying off. Excellent stuff."
4,"Old secrets, solemn promises, new love","Maria returns to her family home near Cape Hatteras in North Carolina after her father?s death, discovers it occupied by a lease-holder who refuses to leave, then finds herself falling in love with him as, together, they try to solve a crime.An entertaining mystery romance."
2,"Eh. I finished the book, I guess that says something.","Gray Hollowell was hired by Mariah's father to find out who murdered his wife several decades before. Then Mariah's dad, Edgar Henry, died. I liked Gray's character but I found it hard to believe that Mariah, who just came out of a physically abusive marriage, would want to hop into bed so soon. I realize Gray was a sweet person but I just couldn't believe Mariah would want this to happen so quickly.Also, why did Edgar suddenly decide to investigate his wife's death when it happened 27 years ago? Another thing that bothered me was that Dixie took the time to write a mystery but it wasn't very suspenseful. I just wasn't impressed with this book."
4,Love it!,"This CD has got all the best songs of Ink Spots. My favorite being Prisoner of Love, The Gipsy, To Each of its Own, and the rare recordings with Ella Fitzgerald. At first I was worry about the recording quality but after I received the CD, I am relieved. It is definitely a best buy!"
3,Good for Beginners,"I ordered this hoping to get a comprehensive video on sign making. If you have never made any signs with a router, this is a good beginning. Portions are very tedious with you watching the author use his router with no voice over. This could have been shortened. It would have been nice to have more information on pattern making, paint selection, and working in various types of wood.It is a good basic video that will get you started."
4,Very hands on and informative!,"I really enjoy this DVD! It's fun to watch and puts you in mood to go in your workshop and get going. I like that you can actually see exactly how Jim Bartz makes relief carving. He could have spent more time covering engraved carving, but you will not be let down. Don't worry if you can't find specific software to make signs. I have been using windows power point and word pad to create fonts with ease. I find myself re-watching the dvd to learn more time and time again!"
5,Great Help for Sign Carvers,"This is an excellent source for the budding sign carver who just needs a little inside knowledge to get started. I built my own router base from 3/8"" acrlic stock and went right to work. I couldn't get the drawing program to do what the video demonstrated but I found a way around that part and got the job done."
1,Worse Flash Programming Book Ever,"Right now I am in the middle of learning Flash 5 with the help of this book. I am spending more time trying to figure out what the author is describing because the editor obviously had no clue how to edit text for computer users. Many of the menu paths are incorrect. For example, where on the Flash menu is the command Copy > Paste in Place (there is a Edit > Paste in Place). This is just one example of why I am getting a headache trying to learn from the [amt] piece of crap. I need to get back to the Help Files to really learn some best practices because this book has none. Hard to follow so a weekend is probably not going to cut it. Look elsewhere unless you enjoy inflicting pain on yourself."
2,"Helpful...sorta...okay, not really","I picked up this book hoping for a quick introduction to Flash, and that's exactly what I got. Not much depth at ALL. However, my problem with the book is that the tutorials don't seem to have been tested. I am an honors computer student, and I still found myself thinking ""Whoa, wait - where did he get that?"" Missing steps, unclear instructions, and typos all contribute to my low rating of this book."
1,Don't make the same mistake I did.,"I write this review because I do not want what happened to me to happen to any of you. I bought this book on impulse. I will never do that again. I was under the impression that a major publishing company would prevent anything like this from hitting the shelves, I was wrong. My advice to any of you out there thinking of buying one of the many Flash books on the market today is, ""BE CAREFUL"". If you are going to buy this book, make sure you get a good look at the book before you break the CD ROM seal, thus making it unreturnable, and leaving you with the curse of owning the book. You are welcome."
3,tight in the bust,"I was so pleasantly surprised to find the same inside pocket in this Marmot jacket as my well loved green Marmot jacket without a hood --- this pocket has always converted my jacket into a pillow & travels everywhere with me - perfect for the Alaskan fishing boats or in front of our morning campfires. Unfortunately, this is not cut for a XS woman - maybe a child with a thick waist & no chest - I wear a 25 in most small cut jeans, size 0, normal bust --- this coat was gaping very unattractively around the middle & squeezing so uncomfortably around the bust - very homely on me.A perfect coat for someone else - I absolutely love my old green Marmot jacket."
