5,Loved it - Haunting,"I loved this book - listened to it on tape.There were several storylines left undone....Royale's encounter with Nina, Chandler's parentage, Ariah's family, etc.Those threads left many possible storylines."
3,The Falls by Jotc Carol Oates,I haven't finished reading the book as I'm reading two books at the same time. I selected the book because of the author. I have read her books before and feel she is a good author.
1,The Falls Joyce Carol Oates,"Awful waste of time and money. Can not go by amazons star ratings. Check others places. I paid for it, so i am trying to finish it."
4,"Love canal, sort of",The author writes in stream of conscious style. It takes her a lot of time to get her message down as she wanders through various obsessive actions by the heroine. It gets more ineresting when it becomes obvious that her life is tied with the Love Canal scandal and that she becomes an activist. I like that part!
3,"""The Falls"" Falls Short","This is not one of Oates's better novels, which explains why I had never heard of it. It begins strong, and has strong parts, but there are too many false leads, too many dead-end attempts at being ""gothic"" and the latter third of the story seems to get lost and meander...it's as if she wrote the ending and then tried to piece it to the first half."
5,One of the best..,"One of the best last sentences in a book. A close 2nd is John Irving's 'A Widow for One Year'.The novel itself is wonderful, but that last sentence is a thing of beauty. Bravo, Joyce Carol...."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I love Joyce Carol Oates and believe she is an amazing writer. I also think this book is exceptionally well-written. However, the plot fell short with me. There are some shocking events in this novel and it is somewhat suspenseful but overall I found the characters to be annoying and didn't really care what happened to them. In addition, the ending did not live up to my expectations. Living in Upstate NY, I did enjoy reading Oates' history of Niagara Falls, NY and the famous Love Canal scandal."
4,"Good, but missing something....","I wish they had half ratings, because this is more of a 3.5 book. The story moves at a prety fast pace, which is good, and if you can get by some of the more outrageous parts of the book (the marraige of the main characters, for instance). But unlike ""We Were The Mulvaneys"", this one never seems to catch fire. I think it's because the characters aren't really that likeable; I never really cared what would happen to them. And the last third, where the children are grown, has no heart. Overall, while interesting, it certainly wasn't a page-turner."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I enjoyed about 80% of this book and feel it is only worthy of a three star review. I found the story interesting, compelling and plausible, up until Royall meets the ""Woman in Black"" in the cemetery. I felt the author made fools out of her readers with this scene. It's as if she could not find a way to reconnect Dirk and what happened to him to his family, and chose to come up with what I believe is a completely unrealistic way (in what was otherwise a very realistic story) in which to do it. As I was reading this portion of the book, my only response to it was ""WHAT?!?"" Or, maybe she decided she had to throw some sex back into the book since there hadn't been any in a while. I'm not sure, but it completely soured me on the rest of the book.I felt the book's ending a bit unsatisfactory - far to many questions left unanswered. This was my second book by this author and might just be my last."
2,The Falls,"This author has a real gift, no doubt. However, her characters are all so flawed and depressing. None of them were people that I would wish to be with or to know! Her description of Niagra Falls and the impact it has had on the inhabitants was mesmorising and well done. It is a ""heavy"" book that weighs you down. There was nothing uplifting in this book. Our book club certainly found a lot to discuss, and it did bring back memories of the Love Canal incident."
3,"I thought it was to scrambled and wordy,","Couldn't wait to get to the end and was not thrilled with the end. Took too long to get to the conclusion, couldn't hold my interest..."
1,Not For Me,"Ms. Oates is a lovely word crafter...however, the depressing and frantic nature of her characters are just not for me. I did not finish this book because I got to the point that I no longer cared how it ended, and I rarely do that. I wouldn't recommend her books to anyone."
2,A Fall from Grace,"In ""The Falls,"" Oates has produced a shaggy dog story with about 200 pages of excess fur, characters who don't engage and incidents that don't convince, plus some of the slackest, most cliched writing of her career. It really does seem as though she premised the entire novel on a wondrous opening scene and couldn't figure out where to take it from there."
2,What's all the hoopla?,"I guess it's just me, but I really didn't like this book. The story was just ok and the prose was so laborious and repetitive that it kind of circled back on itself a few times. It didn't help that the edition I have had so many typo's in it that I wanted to burn the darned thing and send the ashes back to the publishers (Ariah's name was even misspelled in a couple of places). The only reason I finished this book at all is because I stuck with it, hoping it would get better, and by the time I realized it was going to pretty much stink throughout, I was too far in to NOT finish it. If this is a good example of Oates' work, I definitely won't be reading more from her."
3,A slight watershed of disappointment,"It starts out as a page turner with beautiful writing, character descriptions and alliterations but after the major crises in the book occur, it's as if she doesn't know exactly what to do with the rest. It is hard to believe after Ariah turns out to be so psycholigcally unbalanced that Dirk was so in love with her and that her children could be so forgiving. I yearned for something bigger, more dynamic to happen in the second half. The repression of Ariah was so disturbing and the fact that her children never really knew her i.e. her first marriage. It seemed that the author wanted to tie it all together neatly and lost the creative unravelling and mystery which existed in the first half."
1,"""The Falls"" not my Cup of Tea","I hadn't read a J.C.O,'s book in years, and remembered her writing as having a rather strange, Gothic spookiness but I wasn't prepared for this, The dismal offensive characters, atmosphere, and overall trend of the book was depressing, and worst of all, not well-written. When, half-way through, it veered off on an entirely different tack, I gave up and Deleted it with a sigh, and ""Good Riddence"" One offensive detail : when the rich play-boy suitor, comes to woo the ""heroine"" bringing two bottles of Dom Perignon.; she doesn't own a CORKSCREW, he must dig it open with sharp kitchen utensils (?) Pleeze!"
3,I expected more,"The ending was too contrived. Surely JCO can give us more. I worked in NFNY for 10 years. I wished that she had not used NFNY, NFO ad Buffalo street names at random. I spent too much time attempting to relate plot details to my recall of actual places."
3,A little let down after a great beginning...,I really got caught up in this book immediately upon starting to read it. However it started to lag after Dirk was killed. She is a great writer but this one let me down a little. A lengthy read and really captures your attention. Great character development too. Read this one. I don't think you'll be sorry.
1,Unbelievable,"I gave up listening to the audiobook even before the second husband appeared. I kept thinking the year was 1850, not 1950. I can believe these people were sheltered, but give me a break!"
1,couldn't finish it,"This is the first book by Joyce Carol Oates that I have ever attempted to read. I read half of it and gave up. The story line could have been interesting, but the characters were incredibly annoying, especially Ariah, the main character. I finally decided not to waste my time slogging through it to find out what would happen to the characters in the end, because I really just didn't care. I didn't like in the slightest."
4,Thought provoking book,"The more books I read by Joyce Carol Oates, the more I realize what a wonderful storyteller she is. I look forward to reading a book by Ms.Oates because the story is always unique. Each book is not a carbon copy of the one before. The main characters in the books are always so real. You feel that you are taking a trip inside the lives of the people you are reading about. Their lives are never easy, and are never pieces of a puzzle that fit neatly together. In other words, they are REAL. The book I have just completed, The Falls,demonstrates that the main character, Ariah, does seem to have a curse. Unfortunately, she is her own worst enemy, not any imaginary curse that she feels is upon her. I just want to shake Ariah and tell her to count her blessings. Now I guess I can understand how all of our therapists feel!"
3,"""Because it is Bittter...","and Because it is My Heart."" This could easily have been the title of JCO's newest soap-operatic melodrama, complete with names, situations, and the juxtaposition of rich/poor found only in daytime TV. From the pen of a writer of less repute and skill, this work could easily have been dismissed as a future miniseries potboiler. When Ariah's mother-in-law drips acid from her tongue, one can easily envision some old-money matriarch such as Phoebe Tyler. And yet, because she's prolific and because she has often stolen my heart, I persevere and excuse her the italics, the exclamation points, the impossibly ridiculous situations and red herrings. In a sea of too many books and not enough literature, JCO's waterfall of words can still engage and sweep me away for a few days. After John Irving's wretched ""Until I find You"", the toxic fumes of Love Canal were like a breath of fresh air."
4,A Haunting Story,"While the flow was a bit slow, I found I could not put this book down. Contrary to what most here seem to think, I felt the characters were in fact very real. I have known women such as Ariah - moody, a bit odd, perhaps even tortured. Overall unhappy souls, and yet compelling. So I was drawn to Ariah and I liked how the author drew her out, while at the same time recognizing that Ariah is simply not a very nice person.The entire book draws the reader in while at the same time causes the reader to think, to wonder, and to even ask, ""can this be?"" The story seems to be rambling, without cause but the author ties it in nicely. There are scenes which do seem a bit odd, but do play into the story later on. And, in keeping with the overall feeling of the book, the story stays with the readers once the final page is long read.This book is not a fun, summer read, but I feel is worth it if one likes to delve into the intrcacies of human relationships."
2,Drawn out,"I really tried to get into this book but could not. The plot sounded good. It sounded like one of those sweeping family sagas that I enjoy.Problem was, the writing. It's too drawn out and dull. The beginning was too many pages of people waiting for Gilbert's body to surface.I couldn't finish this book. It was putting me to sleep."
5,Great characters,"This novel never got boring. All the main characters are well developed to the point where you'd like to meet them personally. I was a bit leery, because Joyce Carol Oates is known for hits and misses, but this book is definitely a winner. Poetic, descriptive and suspenseful. The more I got into the book, the more I wanted to visit the Niagara Falls and the surrounding area.The writing created the most vivid and beautiful pictures of the falls in my mind. This book convinced me of two things: that Joyce Carol Oates still has the magic touch and that the Niagara Falls have to be seen to be believed!"
2,Had some history content about the Love Canal,"I hated the main female character, found her tedious. It was long and convoluted I thought it had come to the end several times and still had to read on."
3,MORE LIKE A THESIS PAPER THAN A BOOK,"I am a hugh fan of Stephen Ambrose. However, this very small book was a great disappointment. First of all its only about 100 pages plus appendices. It is more like reading a college history report. Stephen Ambrose is my favorite history author but, he seems to have a blind spot when it comes to Eisenhower. In Ambroses eyes he can do no wrong. If you want a much more detailed viewpoint of the battle for Berlin read The Last Battle by Cornelius Ryan."
1,Not what i ordered,"What I wanted was not what i received. They tricked me into ordering what i could have purchased right around the corner. The white labeled bottle that they are showing here is not what i received. The white labeled bottle is the older product thats hard to find and it is much, much better than the new gold labeled bottle that is supposedly the exact same formula or new and improved but it is not. The product I received from here is sold at every sallys hair supply store on the planet at a lower cost than what it is sold for here. I feel raped. and I believe the people selling this knows this. otherwise why are you showing the white labeled bottle and sending the gold labeled bottle. I would like my money back or the correct product because this is some BULL!!"
3,Realistic!,A good story and well researched. I found that the battles could have been more in depth. It gives a feel for the early part of the war.
4,Beautiful Keepsake,"I fell in love with the artwork and just had to have it. A little disappointed that it only covers one year but was able to adapt the last few ""photograph"" pages to cover important events in the subsequent years. But it really is beautiful. I'd do it again for sure."
1,Too many Banannas,"This was very old stock and all the pops were stale. Too many bananna and chocolate, not enough fruit flavored. Wound up throwing more than half the box away."
1,TOOTSIE POPS,I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD BUY BUT THEY ARE CHEAPER AT CVS PHARMACY. CVS SELLS THEM IN PAKS OF 19 FOR 2.99 THAT IS .157 CENTS A PIECE.
4,For Halloween,I bought these for Halloween and with the cost of Halloween candy if you have to give out a lot this is the way to go. It was 10.00 a box for 100. I get about 160-200 children. My only complaint there seemed to be more orange then the other flavors. or maybe the kids just didnt care for orange. In comparison to what I was paying for for Halloween candy at the stores this was definately a much better value
2,i don't like this flavors,"Bought these for the office and they were gone before I knew it. The pops are good as always but I do not like the new flavors. My grandchildren like them but give me the old flavors chocolate, orange, cherry etc."
4,Now vs Then,"I received my first box of these a year ago, and have ordered two since then. The first box was excellent and I'd give five stars for that experience. The second box seemed ""stale,"" and I was a little surprised about that, because I didn't even know they could get stale... but the sucker bits get a bit more brittle, and the tootsie roll inside gets hard as rock. I received my third box a week ago, figuring that the second box was a fluke, and these seem even worse. They're still alright, but not great. I'm undecided on whether or not I'll get another box, as I seem to be detecting a downward trend in quality."
1,Not a variety,"This was suppose to be a varity pack of 100 Tootsie pops. the package had 65 cherry, 10 chocolate, 10 strawberry, 5 Lemon Lime, 5 Blue raspberry, and 5 Watermelon. If I wanted cherry Tootsie pops I would have bought them. I wanted all different flavors. Ruined the carnival game. Kids were disappointed."
4,Fresh and just as described,The pops arrived when quoted and was fresh. I sealed them and refrigerated until I need them. Good price and available when I needed them.
5,Enjoy,"Funny!!!! I recently purchased the DVD's for Kojak, the TV series and walla I had to have these tootsie pops. I had forgotten that they ever existed and was surprised to find them on Amazon. When I did I bought them as a great reminder of the past."
5,Tootsie Roll Pops,"Love them. Nice to have at home on hand. I have them out for company and they, too, enjoy them."
1,Did not arrive on time,"I ordered theseTootsie Pops to give to the trick-or-treaters on Halloween. The delivery day was Halloween. I got them 2 days later. So, Now I have lots of suckers to give my grandkids for Christmas!! :("
2,Tasted like imitation Tootsie Roll Pops,"I ordered these Tootsie Roll Pops to hand out on Halloween. When I opened the box, the wrappers on the Tootsie Pops didn't look like the ones I buy from the store. I opened one and ate it and it didn't taste the same. The outer candy was sickly sweet and the chocolate center was much smaller and lighter in color. I love Tootsie Roll Pops because they are gluten free - the one I ate from this box gave me a stomach ache."
4,"Imaginative, intriguing, revealing and bone-real","Initially, I was carried along by the detail of the characterizations. Such normal, small people with circumscribed lives, even the Hollywood actress. In fact, Updike succeeds in making everyone seem small and ordinary, even Gable and Cooper. In the end I was left with a sense of marvel at an author who cares so deeply about such people, and who is skillful enough to create them, but honest enough to allow them to mistrust and question their creator. God as author... A new avenue to the mysteries of the heart."
1,clumsy and obvious,"I found this book very depressing because the author is so obviously in love with his idea that he forgot to write a novel. I'm fascinated by the topic of religious people questioning their faith, so I would have been very interested in the first section if only there had been any real people involved. But there's no character development; there's just the author working out an idea with wooden puppets. And the irony, if that's what it is, of the doubting minister's grandson ending up in a cult is too clumsy and obvious for this book to deserve any respect."
2,Hmmm,"This is not his best! Updike fans will crave for his normal, brilliant use of imagery and character profiles, but will be lefted parched. Updike falls flat with this one. Boring! And as an avid Updike reader, I, too, was greatly disappointed"
2,Too much,"I read three-fourths of this book before putting it down. I kept hoping for a redeeming feature for at least one of the characters. By the time it got into the life of the daughter, I kept waiting but her personal life got more and more disgusting. I particularly didn't like the references to all the Hollywood stars that she supposedly made movies with. Using real facts about real movie stars with a fictional person just didn't jive with me. The book started out with deep theological questions but never answered them. The historical events mentioned in the book were the only interesting features of the whole book. A big disappointment is how I would rate this book."
2,updike surfeit,"Updike has written some compelling novels, but this is not one of them. overwritten, tedious in places, yet rewarding in the early phases. Once Essie starts starring with Jimmie Stewart, Clark Gable, etc., the story loses whatever magic it had. And the wind up with a recreation of the WACO siege turns it into a pot-boiler. Maybr Updike has written himself out. At any rate he needs a better copy editor."
3,What a piece....of work,"Having to read this book for english, I at first was not too thrilled with the idea of the plot and found it to be boring. I could not identify with Clarence, the first main character. But apon getting to Teddy and Essie, both whom were my age at a time and a bit like me, I discovered that this book really was good. I learned if you can believe it--the interwoven history lessons everywhere were a way of presenting me with this nations timeline w/o shoving facts in my face. I enjoyed it thoroughly actually, and i believe I will read it again soon under happier circumstances in which i am not forced to read 1/5 of the book everynight and take 12 pages of notes per fifth. Its Good--and thats alot to say coming from the mouth of an over-critical teenager."
3,"Beautiful Work, but...","Mr. Izu produces wonderful work. His photographs of flowers are exquisite. The drawback to this book is that for it's price I expected much, much better reproductions. The screening used in the book is coarse. I have seen much better reproductions in Bullfinch and NYGS publications. John Sexton's, Ansel Adams and other's books are good examples of the quality I would have expected from a similarly priced book."
4,"Great, but not for side sleepers...","This is a great product as long as you are sleeping on your back. I love it for napping in the chair or in the car. I really like the sounds, but be aware it doesn't block out other noise (great for me as I want to be able to hear my kids).Unfortunately, I am a side sleeper and the battery and sound unit create uncomfortable pressure on my temples. And since the battery unit is one side and the sound unit is on the other, I am uncomfortable on either side - sometimes ending up with a headache.But it you are a back sleeper or want it for naps in the recliner or for travel, THIS IS A FIRST CLASS PRODUCT!"
3,"Okay, but not very comfortable","The loop soundtrack really annoyed me. The itchiness of the velour was another negative point; I wore a silk mask underneath to combat that problem. After a few days use, I found it was just a pain to put on/hook up/sleep comfortably (I move around a lot in my sleep).I bought a sound machine and used my cheaper pair of silk eye mask."
1,Big Disappoinment!!!!,"I ordered this item for my migraines and insomnia...I was really excited when I got it!! Well, guess what? The 'white noise' sounds advertised do not play....I tried a couple sets of batteries.This is not a great product-I will give it this though, it is comfy and blocks out all light. I guess I can give it one star for that."
3,Poor quality from middle on,The movie arrived on time and was great until the middle where it was distorted and skipped from there until the end. IT is still my favorite movie but was very disappointed inthis copy. I was cheated and sad that I saved this for my first Christams Eve I had been off in 8 years and not to be able to really enjoy my favorite movie with all my family together.
5,Xmas Carol,This item was received in a timely fashion & it was a gift to my son. this is by far the best film of Xmas Carol & especially so in ble-ray.Janette Todd
5,awesome movie,This was exactly what I was looking for and love watching it in the black and white version. Love it.
5,Best version of Christmas Carol,This is the best version of the Christmas Carol.Alister Sim makes the most provactive and animated Scrooge.It creates a mood that takes you on Scrooge's journey.A family favorite even though it is a older version of theChristmas Carol. A classic !
1,Cheap Transfer Interferes with Great Film,"Starting from the cheap computer effects introduction from third-rate VCI Entertainment and an ancient Patrick McNee video introduction, my heart sank -- I knew immediately that I had been had. The DVD said ""restored and remastered from the original 35mm negative"", but this could not be further from the truth. The picture and audio is atrocious, belying the no-budget nature of this release. Be under no illusions -- there was no restoration or remastering involved here. It is amazing that such a fraud would be perpetrated in this age of routine restorations of even the most mundane films. Perhaps Criterion can get a hold of this."
5,The best ever!,"I've seen most of the Christmas Carol movies ever made. George C. Scott was wonderful. Albert Finney was good in an overblown movie. Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck, Muppets, and even Gene Lockhart (whose daughter, June, played one of Cratchit's children).But nothing stands up to this movie. The added story elements (in Christmas Past) are all in the right vein, and the story builds to a wonderful climax. I cannot see other movies without thinking of scene after scene from this version. Alastair Sim IS Scrooge. And yes, his giddiness after being saved from Christmas Yet-to-come is exhilirating. There are no weak links in this movie. Mrs. Dilber's astonished ""For me?"" when Scrooge gives her money is just one example of the detail this movie has. Purists may shudder, but I even like the colorized version. I can't wait to see the restored version of the Black and White."
3,Missing Frames,"There is one rather strange anomaly with this transfer, motion suddenly ""jumps,"" as if a frame or two is missing, though the soundtrack continues apace and there are no missing seconds from the timecode if you engage ""Display"" on your BD player (I mention this only for readers who may think it's a fault with the BD itself rather than the transfer). A good example of this (just one of several) on A Christmas Carol is near the end of the film, at circa 1:18:17 and again at 1:18:22, when Scrooge is at the window saying ""What a beautiful morning"" and obviously lurches. I guess it might be a missing frame, but one would expect the sound to skip there, which it doesn't. Another moment is at 1:22:18 where one would think the piano playing in the parlor would be slightly interrupted if it's missing frames we're dealing with. VCI states they've gone back to 35mm masters to do this new Blu-ray, I'm frankly at a loss to explain it."
5,Best Ever Christmas Carol,"As far as I am concerned this is the best ever version of A Christmas Carol. Spare and dark, it exactly captures the essence of Dicken's England. We watch it every Christmas."
5,Peerless,"While many have tried, no-one has captured the essence of Dickens so fully as in this early 50's version that to many defines once-and-for-all the characters of A Christmas Carol, and Sim's Scrooge is the centerpiece -- a man utterly without a heart, whose transformation by the spirits of Christmas is so believeable, so transparent as to be the standard by which all subsequent Scrooges must be judged. True to Dickens while flexible for the sake of film-making with a mythically pastoral England and a very good supporting cast, including The Best Marley's Ghost (my opinion) and a wonderfully entertaining Mrs. Dilber, the housekeeper, this one is the very best film version available and with the improved sound and brighter images in this anniversary edition, this is the one to have -- unless you insist on the over-the-top visuals of the ""colorized"" edition."
5,A Christmas Classic,Nothing beats this original version. We can't find it any longer on TV over the holidays so decided it was time to just buy it!
5,Still the Best,"My wife and I believe that ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of the most important stories every written, not only for the holiday season but for all times during the year. We recently watched all nine versions we have accumulated through the past 20+ years. These include the ones with Seymour Hicks in 1935, to Patrick Stewart in 1999. This 1951 production, starring Alistair Sim, is the best. What we like about it most is how Scrooge is depicted after he's visited by the three Christmas spirits. He is totally transformed. He shows unbridled joy in being released from bondage to greed and contempt for his fellow man. This depiction is unmatched by the other versions. The colorized form of the movie is outstanding and adds a good bit to the story-telling. If anyone wants this Dickens classic in its finest incarnation, this is the DVD to get."
5,The only version worth watching!,This is the version that is the best. Even though it is in black and white. It's the best. Alastair Sim is just magnificient as Scrooge. A true adaptation of Dickens' story. It's only on once every year but it's still the best. Now even better that it's on DVD. The quality is just excellent. It never looked better!
3,A Christmas Carol,"While the Blu-Ray version is much clearer, I wish I had selected the Ultimate Collector's edition. It had a remastered B&W digital version plus a color version."
5,Best Christmas Carol By Far,"A true classic, Sim's brilliant performance raises it to a level that no other Christmas Carol even approaches. His post-transformation performance is some of the best minutes of acting ever put on film. The supporting cast is excellent from Bob Marley right down to the boy who buys the Christmas bird and the maid at Scrooge's neice's house. A must see."
1,DVD - malfunction,This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. I own a copy on tape and decided to update to a DVD. I was very disappointed when the DVD stopped/stalled at least seven times while I was trying to view it. I looked at the disc and could not see any damage of any kind. I tried it in both of my DVD players and it still kept stopping. I am not happy!
4,Wonderful acting - themes come through,"Dickens purists, myself among them, must admit that there are liberties taken in this presentation to which ""Boz"" would take great exception. For example, the home of the impoverished Bob Cratchitt is more luxurious than that of most viewers', and, miserable sort though Scrooge was, he did NOT put Fezziwig out of business. With this said, I must admit the film is generally quite delightful.Sim ""fleshes out"" the character of Scrooge (who, in this version, happily is allowed to be a redeemed miser - there is none of the ""psychology"" that would flavour some later remakes), making all aspects of the narrative highly believable. Excellent acting and a general period flavour are a delectable and enduring combination, and one even a purist finds quite addictive."
3,"I realize that this is a classic, but I was scared!!!","I saw this movie when I was a child because my Dad insisted I be exposed to classic film. To be honest, I don't have very fond memories of that day! I remember being scared out of my wits to go to bed, and having nightmares. Looking back, I suppose I was just being childish, but my fear was very real and i haven't seen the movie again since (even though I recently sat thru ""Psycho"" relatively unalarmed). My point in writing this is to let all you parents know that this movie is quite scary for a young child to watch and I strongly suggest to wait until they're able to understand the meaning of this story before they watch this movie. I realize that this isn't everyone's idea of a scary movie, especially in this day and age, but to an impressionable child it can appear very real."
3,I was expecting colorized,"We started to watch this blu-ray and the video was the cleanest we have seen so far for this film; however, the audio was hollow and unbearable. We ended up watching our colorized version on DVD instead. Hopefully next year they will continue to improve this video by adding color and improving the sound."
1,not worth it,"they lead u to believe that this is the ultimate dvd. has a lot of extras but DOES NOT INCLUDE the colorized version. not worth the money get the cheaper colorized dvd that has both versions. while i enjoy the black & white version, it is nice to see the colorized version as well."
3,Uneven Sound Makes Watching Difficult,"Yes, the visuals are great--no complaints there. But the sound on this edition is strangely uneven. Whenever the music swells (which is often), it so overwhelms the dialogue that you cannot hear the actors' words.The appeal of this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" has always been its faithfulness to the words and spirit of Dickens' writing. Sadly, that is undercut by the frustration of trying to make out dialogue that is smothered under overly loud music."
3,The Ghost Of Xmas Past,"Oh what a pity! This is just a re-hash of stuff that has been available seperately for a few years now. Firstly the b&w version is the excellent digitally enhanced 'Emerald Version' which may not still be available (but included most of the 'extras' listed here), coupled with the colourised version with intro by Patrick McNee which was issued around the late 90's (In the UK The Sun daily newspaper gave it away for free with their 40p(20 cents) paper last Christmas ) Why oh why didn't they let Legend Films colourise it? All you have to do is look at the colourised version of 'It's a Wonderful Life' to see the what they can now do ...... Crisp vibrant print and natural colours instead of the fuzzy colours on this version.So only 3 out of 5 (mainly for the Emerald Version)"
3,"This is a VHS tape, not a DVD disc","I wasn't paying attention when I purchased this, but it is a VHS tape. Luckily I found a VHS player in my attic, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to watch it. The tape is good, it is in black and white, and the price can't be beat, but be warned that it is VHS. Amazon also sells the 2-disc DVD, which I recently purchased to complete my Christmas Carol set."
5,Love it,Great holiday fun. This movie should be a part of everyone's holiday movie lineup. Arrived in great condition like new
1,Warning! Not a colorized copy! I sent it back.,"Because it was a 2-disc set, I assumed one disc was the original film and the other colorized, as I knew that this distributor, VCI had a colorized VHS version out there 15 years ago. Also, AMC just ran it colorized. (I have colorized sets like this of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Holiday Inn"".) ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" 2 disc set is also b/w. Be careful when ordering!"
5,This Is The Ultimate,"If you love ""A Christmas Carol"" you must have this. You have a choice on how to watch it. See it as it originally was made in black and white or watch it colorized. Also you get the bonus of the 1935 ""Scrooge"" version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" with Seymour Hicks. You also have the option of enhanced for wide screen. You just can't beat your choices. Alister Sims is definitely ""Scrooge."" The Dicken's story is my favorite Christmas tale and here you get quality plus variety."
5,scrooge,"Very pleased with CD. Fast delivery and in perfect condition. Great having the two versions, black and white and colorized. Great movie version of Dickens classic tale."
2,A Christmas Carol Movie,"This is an excellent movie; however, whomever re edited this film made the background music so loud that you have a very hard time hearing or understanding what the people are saying... I was very disappointed with the quality of this product."
4,Re-mastered Old Classic,"This is the 1951 British movie of the Christmas Carol. It has been re-mastered from the orginal and WOW it is so clear. The last time a saw this movie was on TV and it was so grainy and difficult to hear one was great. It has all the old charm but with today's quality of film. In this package you get to orginal B&W; and a color version.My whole family (9 year old, 6 year old, my husband and I) all watched the movie. This was first time for my daughter and she was so happy with the ending - seeing it for the first time.A great addition to your Christmas Collection - Enjoy!"
4,Response to B.Bowzer,"Acording to IMDB.com and Maltin, it was indeed Patrick MacNee playing the young Marley. Glyn Dearman played Tiny Tim."
1,Don't buy this,"This is the best Christmas Carol available. However, this DVD has red subtitles that won't disappear. They appear to be embedded in the actual film. Whoever did this should be ashamed of themselves. Like I said, this is the best Christmas Carol ever made with Alistair Sim, the quintessential Scrooge, but someone has tampered with this version and really marred it with these subtitles. Why can't I just buy this DVD without them??"
5,"Finally, a pristine restoration of the best Christmas Carol!","I have owned practically all of the VHS and DVD versions of this movie. Alastiar Sim gives an over-the-top performance as Scrooge. As wild as it is, it resonates with audiences and the true spirit of Dickens. This Blu-ray disc does not contain the 80s colorized version of the movie. There are new special features, including an interview with one of the production staff members. This restoration is worth the price of purchasing a Blu-ray player... for just one movie."
3,Same classic story,"In black and white, this movie is very well done and the usual must-see for Christmas. But the unfortunate attempt at color is poor and detracts from the classic story."
5,Greatest Christmas Movie,This movie is truly a timeless classic. Alister Sim gives a great performance and the effects are done very well for the time it was made. You can't help but smile and laugh when Scrooge wakes up on Christmas morning full of good cheer and the Christmas spirit.
5,inspring,"This remake is an excellent and inspiring dvd. while shared with the whole family, it didn't seem to quite capture the attention of our children like it captivated me. BW and Color option was nice. I watched color before Christmas and then B&W on Christmas eve and will probably do so again next year. Outstanding product!!!"
3,Very good blue ray/no colorized version contrary to product description,"2 disc DVD AND BLUE RAY remaster and released in 2011 Alistar Sim release is good!! Black and white DVD version is great! The DVD disk contains a Cambels Soup radio show which features"" A Christmas Carol"" with Lionel Barrymore...Great !!! The con is the description for this Blue RAY of the "" Alistar Sim"" A Christmas Carol"" are all the same suggesting there is a colorized restored version and a restored black and white versio on the other disk. There IS NO COLORIZED VERSION ON THIS 2 DISC BLUE RAY AND DVD SET"". tHE COST IS VERY GOOD AT $14.00 but no colorized restored blue ray edition. THE ONLY COLORIZED VERSION I COULD FIND A SINGLE DVD 2007 VERSION AT $50.00 WAY TOO MUCH!!!! Any way you look at it this 2 disk Blue Ray / DVD is worth the cost and the blue ray version in black and white is so goo d as far as clarity in vidio and audio. BEWare NO COLORIZED VERSION HERE."
5,a christmas dream... for my mum.,my mum asked if i could get this movie for her. i watch it and it was fantastic to get both colour and black and white version was great...
3,Great film but the Blu-Ray has some flaws,"I just started watching the film on Blu-ray and have noticed many problems.First, the default audio setting makes the music considerably louder than the dialogue and you can barely understand what the characters are saying. Choose the original mono for sound.Second, the aspect ratios available have problems. The film was originally released in a 1.43:1 aspect ratio. The 4:3 setting is intended for 4:3 television screens and contains the picture in its original aspect ratio. (My widescreen TV does not allow a 4:3 setting for watching blu-rays). The setting for 16:9 televisions crops the picture on the top and bottom to fit the entire screen.The blu-ray also does not have the pop up menus that one can normally turn on during the film.On a positive note, the picture quality is very good, has red subtitles, and optional DVS for visually impaired."
5,fave Christmas movie,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies and I was happy to see it on DVD!!!
1,Christmas Carol,Love the story but the music track overwhelmed the voices..I was disappointed in the DVD.. but again its a classic.
3,Color or Not,"This is one of my favorite movies for the holiday season. A few years back it was remastered and it looks unbelievable! They also added the colorized version in the set. This is great for all the children who tend not to like B&W movies. Last year when the blu-ray was announced, I was sure they would do the same thing, but they didn't. The blu-ray is B&W only. I realize that there are those of us who would prefer that nothing be done to make B&W movies into color! However, as I've said, some people really like it AND, You get BOTH B&W and Color. You don't have to watch the color one if you don't want to. I for one, will not be replacing my DVD until they offer me both B&W and Color versions! Why should I, my kids will only watch the color one. I do wish they'd get around to though, I'd love to see it on Blu-ray."
3,Sound track off,"The two film versions are of high quality but the sound tracks appear to be off. There are two versions: ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""Scrooge"". The opening scene's sound track of A Christmas Carol appear to be on a faster track. However the producers corrected the sound track to its proper speed after the opening credits.However the sound track for Scrooge is on a faster track throughout the movie. If you're ok with the sound track kinks then go for it as the film quality is good."
5,Great Classic,"Of all the ""Scrooge"" movies made, I have always thought this one was the best. Great acting."
4,A Christmas Carol Review,"Over the past few years it was getting much more difficult to find this version in the TV listings around Christmas time. I finally decided to purchase the DVD. I got a great deal through Amazon and am very happy with the quality of the DVD version. I like both the original and color versions. I know there was some concern about a missing part near the end, but it was hardly noticable and did not detract from the story. This is truly a Collector's Edition."
4,a christms carol ultimate collector' edition,"Great B&W, very good colorized. Though, as I am over 60 years old, I am partial to the old B&W version. Black and White always seems to add to a movie without taking away any of the quality of the story. Not usually so with a remake in color, though I understand why many of today's croud prefer it. It's like pumping in laughfter (not necessary) trying to add to a movie and usually ends up with a negative result. A good movie needs only a great story and good actors , a great movie needs only a good story with exceptionaly great actors. As it should be."
4,Scrooge (A Christmas Carol),"I love this movie and this remastered copy is great. My only was problem I didn't realize that it is colorized. Not a big fan of that. Othewise, I'm very pleased with the purchase."
3,Restored?,My rating for this release is not for the film itself.This movie deserves 5 stars and should be viewed more than once a year.The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this so called restored version is of the same picture and sound quality as the 2 previous VCI releases.I don't no where they got the video to show the before and after comparisons but I have never seen this film this deteriorated. Not even on Public TV who have shown this film every Christmas Eve over the last 20 years.To make things worse disk 2 includes the 1935 version of Scrooge.This is the butchered 60 minute version not the 67 minute version which was released a couple of years ago by Blackhawk Films.The only reason to buy this is for the George Cole interview which is given by one of the most lifeless interviewers I have ever seen.
1,"Why, oh why?","This great movie, the best version, is ruined by the colorizing. All it really adds is ... colors that are pale and out of place, as with all colorized versions of any movies. The old B&W scenes add a touch of old London in the 19th century to the whole movie watching experience. Either find the B&W version or try to turn off the color on your TV."
5,The Best Scrooge of All,"Watched both versions (color, black & white) at Christmas. Grandkids liked the color version better but hubby and I enjoy the original B&W. All of us agree Alastair Sim is SCROOGE. His grumpiness, his fright, his seeing of the light, his giddiness, his happiness and delight in the end are all infectious. Nothing gets me into the real ""spirit of Christmas"" as Alastair's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge."
4,Best Version of A Christmas Carol,"Alastair Sim's performance is hard to beat as his Scrooge is done so well, so despicable in the beginning and so giddily child-like after he learns his lesson. This movie to me is a classic which should be watched every Christmas. The sets superbly capture the atmosphere of the time and the actors all seem to be expertly cast for their roles. Just an enjoyable film which should be in every movie buffs movie library. If you have not seen this version of A Christmas Carol, you are missing something special."
4,The Classic Holiday Movie--A Christmas Carol,Excellent movie--the classic and original. Makes the holiday complete!!
3,Good story; picture dark,The story line is done well but the scenes were done in a dark setting so it is hard to follow the scenes.
5,A Christmas Carol Ultimate Collector's edition,"This was priceless to my husband and myself. It has the entire cast and partial biographies. It was interesting and very infomrative. Anyone who loves the old movies and particularly this A christmas Carol with Alistair Sims will NEVER be disappointed. My only mistake was waiting til l Christmas to buy it, prior to December it was $9.99...but I waited til December and it went up to $13.99, still that was an excellent price AND I can't find this particular edition and movie anywhere else!! Amazon comes thru again. This was brand new...not used."
5,Simply the greatest,"This is quite simply the greatest screen version of Charles Dicken's masterpiece. Indeed it is a masterpiece in it's own right.When I grew up I started searching for versions of the folk song ""Barbara Allen"" and it is because of the scene in this movie when Scrooge musters the courage to go to his nephew's home for Christmas dinner. That scene is one of my favorites in all moviedom."
5,A Christmas Carol (1951),"Based on Charles Dickens's most widely read and enduring story, this definitive 1951 British version, better known as ""Scrooge,"" outdoes all others for atmosphere and, of course, characterization. The incomparable Alastair Sim, a gifted actor who seamlessly inhabits his role, makes you believe he is Scrooge. Skillfully directed by Brian Desmond-Hurst, ""Carol"" is tight at roughly eighty-five minutes, yet remains extremely moving, with Sim's droopy eyes projecting all of Scrooge's terror, shame, and regret. By contrast, his outright giddiness at the film's conclusion will leave you feeling just the same way--very much in the holiday spirit."
5,Great redux,"My wife is a fanatic for this film. She could not locate her DVD copy purchased a few years back.I bought this for her even after reading the downsides mentioned by some reviewers. I told her about those comments and was curious what she thought.Maybe it could be even better than this version if they started with a better master. However, I noticed that the video is much better even with its flaws. If you need to watch this film around Christmas, this IS the one to get."
4,"Bonus"" Scrooge"" is shortened version","This version is fantastic!!! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the bonus 1935 version of ""Scrooge"" on disc 2. It is the short 59 minute version instead of the complete 78 minute version. It too is a classic IMHO and they should have used the complete version for this otherwise magnificent 2 disc set for the holidays."
5,A Christmas Carol,"Bottom line review: This movie looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray. This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is most likely the most definitive version. I loved the story as a child and loved the movie versions. I have watched pretty much every contemporary version available, and this version is without question THE version to have. Buy it and enjoy it!"
1,Don't buy VCI!,"A great movie (we have watched the VCR tape of it for years).A horrible reproduction of it by VCI.Muddy, unclear images.And the subtitles won't turn off. And they were obviously done by computer, ""Well"" becomes ""Will"" and unending other such garbage transcription. VCI put not effort into this product."
5,Memories,"I have watched this black and white version and loved it, seeing it in colour was fantastic, will show it to my grandchildren every Christmas from now on."
4,Best Version of a Holiday Classic,"There are several versions of the Dickens story, I think this is the one closest to the original story. Well done, shows the wretched conditions most people lived in during the Victorian Era.Good performances from Sim and the supporting cast."
1,Quite possibly the worst DVD ever made,"Such a classic movie put to shame by shoddy DVD reproduction.If you are looking to build your DVD collection, avoid ""VCI home video"" at all costs.You cannot even read the interface, and the menu is a complete mess. Sound quality is awful, and the image quality looks like they put a 1980 video recorder on a worn porn theatre screen.I LOVE this movie, but VCI should be shot. Who in their right mind gave them the rights to such a piece of film history?Pathetic!I wish there was a ""-5 star"" option"
5,love it!,"This version of A Christmas Carol is the very best. A steller cast - Allister Sim IS Scrooge. This should be in every home.The characters, the costumes, the setting - all perfect. The values this story teaches are excellent - it is a story that really makesone think. Schools would do well by their students to show this movie in classes!"
2,I Dont Get It?,"I am for watching old classics and enjoy a great many of them but this one is just too dated. Even though it is a musical, ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney is far superior or to see George C Scott's performance in ""A Christmas Carol"" is awesome and both available on DVD. This version is poorly acted, very dry and horribly dated. I cant see how Sim is regarded as the best Scrooge. Even the scrooge in the 1935 version is more animated. Get the other two I mentioned and see for yourself. I'm sorry, but this version needs to fade away."
3,Not the one I thought it was,"I have very happy memories of watching A Christmas Carol every Christmas Eve morning with my father. I knew that it was an older version, with the really obvious colorization, but I wasn't sure which edition it was, so I bought this one. It isn't the right one.This video just doesn't do anything for me. Alastair Sim does a good job as Ebeneezer Scrooge, and of course the story is a classic, but if you're going to get a version of A Christmas Carol that you remember from childhood, make sure it's the right one."
1,misleading cover picture-no color,"I assumed this movie had been colorized, by looking at the cover. There is a dvd and a blu-ray disc, but what is the point of doing blu-ray on a black and white move? The opening and the menu are in color, but then it goes to the original black and white movie. This was a favorite old Christmas tradition for me, and I thought I would enjoy a color version of it. There is no mention of any color on the cover so am I stuck with this purchase?"
2,Way over-rated,"I'll admit it. I didn't see the Sims version until after I'd seen the Scott version and, by comparison, Sims is an affected, scenery chewer. The performance is so over the top and hammy that it makes me squirm."
1,Disappointed,"When I ordered this dvd I thought that it would be great to have ""A Christmas Carol"" in blu-ray but I was terribly disappointed to find they didn't colorize the movie. Imagine a blu-ray vivid color dvd of black and white. Why would anyone do that?"
1,George C. Scott was the better Scrooge...,"The superior version of ""A Christmas Carol"" featured George C. Scott in the title role. This version should have been retired with the Edsel."
2,Awful Audio,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. This has always been my favorite version of A Christmas Carol, so I was looking forward to watching it after not having seen it in a long time. Throughout most of the movie, the background music was way louder than the dialogue, so it was extremely difficult to hear anything."
2,Color?,"I was disappointed, I was under the impression that it was the colorized version. I have the B&W version and didn't need a blu-ray B&W version, now I have three B&W DVDs. It is still a great movie."
5,Stunning Restoration,"This classic film has been given an amazing restoration. Not only have they cleaned up the dirt and scratches, but the audio is now much clearer and noise free. The Blu-Ray disc is also incredibly sharp. It's just amazing."
4,Overdue remaster of the holiday classic,"This holiday classic has been long overdue for quality remastering. The 1951 film is often hailed by critics as the best of many screen adaptations of Dickens' beloved tale, with Alastair Sim - for whom the film was created - the perfect Scrooge. The black-and-white image is excellent, if a bit grainy in some scenes. There are no major extras - most of the talent associated with the film has been dead a long time - but the set does come with an extra disc with standard DVD of the film. If it's a color version (with music) you'd enjoy, try ""Scrooge!"" with Albert Finney as Scrooge."
4,The Best Version of this Classic,"To fans of this movie it is no secret that this version of the often told tale is the best. Why would you want the Blu-ray version? The restoration is the best ever, and the extras add more enjoyment. I first saw this version of Dickens story on television in the early seventies. I fell in love with the performances and was always disappointed in the visual and when it was colorized... Well that was too much. I bought the dvd version when it came out and while it was ok it lacked the sheen that I saw in the film version. With the Blu-ray the sheen is back. As usual in 1080P the film grain is visible. On the big screen you can enjoy a very filmic display. I loved it and found it the most satisfying version to date."
4,Not the original,"Actually not the original version. The original wasREGINAL OWENS IN 1938, but a good version.Reginal's version is my favorite, but, is only availablein VHS at the moment."
3,Alastair Sim...,"As one who enjoys ""A Christmas Carol,"" I agree that this is a good version of Dickens' classic tale. Myself, I've had no problems with the DVD as others have reported. And the price was right. My issue? The 1938 version starring Reginald Owen is better! Now, don't get me wrong. This version IS GOOD. I liked it enough to buy it! But, in my book, it will always be #2, with Reginald Owen's 1938 version being #1! Three stars!!"
5,Scrooge,"A dvd version of ""Scrooge"" starring Alistair Sim in the title role.My favorite vesrion and one that I had seen every Christmas since 1958 through 2007. It was not shown on my cable tv this past year and I swore I would not miss it again.And now I won't !!"
5,A favorite,Best version of A Christmas Carol. Alistair Sim nails the part. It's a must watch in my family every year.
5,Colorized - A Christmas Carol w/Reginald Owen,This is one of the BEST of this movie. Reginald Owen and the Tiny Tim guy are perfect. Much more realistic to me than Alistair Sim as Scrooge. Color great and sound also. All fine. Rates 5 stars in my book and I would recommend to anyone. GREAT movie for Christmas especially. No glitches even tho is an old movie.Cecy Ivie
3,A Christmas Carol,"The Alastair Sim version of a Chrismas Carol is my favorite version of this great story. The restored version is very good and enhances the pleasure of watching this film. However, the special features are boring. Instead of talking about the film the special feature is an interview of the actor who plays the younger Scooge and his career in film. I purchased this version because I thought there would be more on how the film was made. Very disappointing."
5,Scrroooooggggeee!!!!,"I remember finding this exact VHS version sold by a street vendor for $3 during Christmas one year. We brought it home and it became my boyfriend's son's favorite movie. Because he was learning to read, he would ask for it by the name on the box, and he mimicked Bob Marley's ghost calling for him ... Ebeneeeezer ..... Ebenezer Scrooooogggge!!! This kid (Nicholas) would watch this movie over and over and over again. Even a little 4 year old child knew it was great. And it is. My favorite version of this movie, hands down (in addition would be the 2 cartoon versions ... Donald Duck and Mr. Magoo, which Nicholas liked, as well). But this classic in a bargain bin sold on the street ... sad ... but who knows? Maybe it made it accessible to more people that way. All I know is, I'm very glad it's finally received the praise it deserves. It is a diamond in the sand."
1,Something wrong with this transfer.,"I have played this disk on three blu ray players and the faults are always in exactly the same places. The amazing thing is they are on the DVD that comes with the blu ray in the same places. Maybe they were on drugs, who knows. Anyway great film, lousy disk."
5,BEST EVER!!!,"FINALLY!! My days of shuttering at the sound of the sippy cup being thrown onto the ground while I am trying to do a few chores around the house are finally over!! After reading some of the reviews, I am surprised by the (good) quality of this product. I have maneuvered it and bent it in all kinds of different ways and it seems really sturdy. I am also amazed by the flexibility of the arm - i can rig it to anything and get it into the perfect position for my daughter. Whew!!!The ONLY possible downside for some people is that the arm that I got is faux leopard skin. haha I actually like it but if I had a boy I'm not sure I would want to take it outside.Great product!!"
3,Female libertine finds her male partner-in-crime,"Although the promiscuously inclined protagonist finds her HEA, romance takes a back seat to eroticism in this novel. Fortunately she falls for a man who hasn't a single jealous bone in his body and is as intrigued by sexual experimentation as is the heroine.Each chapter is centered upon a sexual adventure, and the adventures become more recklessly hedonistic as the book progresses. Sexually speaking, Emma is a heroine who will try ANYTHING once (at least).I cannot agree with the reviewer who compares this author to the supremely talented Emma Holly. Although equally explicit, her sex scenes do not convey the sense of uncertainty and joy that Emma Holly achieves.Be forewarned: the novel includes not only M/F and F/F, but also anal, some M/M, an anonymous gangbang and more."
3,No Good is Okay,"after reading a number of reviews on black lace books i chanced upon UP TO NO GOOD at the bookstore and thought i'd try it out....it was okay....the sex scenes were definately steamy...but i'm not into degradation so a lot of the book was just reading for me (as opposed to literary voyuerism)....my girlfriend read it and is looking forward to reading other black lace books...i just hope there isn't the issue of self-degradation....otherwise, it was a pretty good read..."
1,"Up to no good at all, in fact","Although it says this is erotica by women for women, it reads more like something written by a freshman horn-dog for his frat brothers. It's hard to believe a woman got anywhere near this book. It's not just that the sex is degrading, or unrealistic for a woman, or that the writing is so bad ... more that the writer doesn't leave any space in the scene for you to participate as a reader. The whole sensuous, erotic, passionate element is missing. Try elsewhere."
3,Black Cohosh,"Black cohosh seems to be the primary ingredient. That being so, just buy the black cohosh extract at a much cheaper price. Too, Spring Valley's dosage is many times higher than remifemin's. Me? I've gone the Spring Valley route.Hope this is helpful.Gee Gee"
5,"winter winds may blow, but this book will heat you up!","If this book doesn't get you into a romantic and sexy mood, then surely you must be dead. I loved each story in this anthology and even found myself wanting to go back and re'read a few. Whew, these authors can spin a fantasy like nobody's business. My advice to the readers of the world: let your troubles drift away, and slip into a little something HOT!"
3,geochronology of sandia cave,While there seems to be some question about the work done at sandia cave by Hibbon the reviews by Haynes & Agogino are superb.
5,Magnificent once again,"For those in need of some enlightment, Oceansize is one of the most talented and underrated bands in the world.I just finished listening to ""Everyone Into Position"", and I can barely find the words to describe how wonderful this album is.Somewhat more accessible, in my opinion, than their two jaw-dropping previous efforts, ""Effloresce"" and ""Music For Nurses"" (because probably a bit less metal), be certain that you won't find anything cheap or easy on this record, as Oceansize's creations are complex and incredibly inspiring. It is simply impossible to even consider the ""skip"" button, because each track is so rich and non-linear, you just need to know what happens next.Everything just sounds so damn right...Although this band can't really be compared to anything else, for those you've never heard of it, think of the best elements that dredg, Muse, Biffy Clyro, Sigur Ros and Tool combine.Each of their releases is a masterpiece, and ""Everyone Into Position"" is no different."
4,Varied but inspired,"This album has a real variety of styles, ideas and tracks.* Pluses - ""Homage to a Shame"" which could almost have been on the previous album but has more internal diversity, ""Charm Offensive"" and ""No Tomorrow"" which are both brooding and seemingly low-key but curiously intense prog rock numbers which explode at the end, the pared back, acousticish and synth-riddled ""Music For A Nurse"" and ""New Pin"", and the just broadly speaking good track ""Heaven Alive"". An EP with these tracks on board would have earned my highest rating possible.* Minuses - The total randomness and lack of form elsewhere on the album.I would strongly recommend hearing Effloresce first and then getting this one."
2,Very poor production - vocals buried in lots of noise,"This cd purchase was my greatest disappointment of 2007. I bought it based on what I heard from the Amazon Music Sampler, but upon receipt found the production to be so poor I just can't listen to it. The vocals are buried deep in lots of noise, which makes up much of the content. I'd pass if I were you."
4,Questionable durability,Got this as a gift for 18 month year old boy only lasted 18 months with it mostly being played with inside granted he plays rough but steering column broken lost 1 part can't find replacement had it rigged with ace hardware screws duct ape and super glue the boys finally broke it for good after another 9 months sits in backyard collecting rust any buyers?
5,GREAT RIDE FOR THE KIDS,"THEY REALY LIKE THIS & SO DO I , THIS DOES STEER A LOT SHARPER THAN THE OTHER BRANDS I NOTICED THEY CAN SWING IT AROUND IN A TIGHT SPOT COMPARED TO OTHERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Beware - VERY SHARP Peeling Metal Paint Trim on girl's speedster,"The boy's metal speedster version of this toy was well-reviewed so I purchased one for my toddler grandson and the girl's pink one for my toddler granddaughter. That was 2 months ago. I have her car at my house and she has barely played with it. Last night I noticed something peeling off of the silver hood ornament and cut myself twice trying to remove it.The boy and girl versions of the toys appear to be identical except for the color of the body, and the silver-colored parts seem to be exactly the same.The paint-like silver metal paint or laquer on the Schylling girl's pink speedster ornament peels and is a sharp, metallic substance. It is also possible that a small child could ingest this paint."
4,Rocked My claznock yo!,well this cd definately rocked my little tiny world. I'll tell you all my base are belong to this cd! i recomend that you take all your pimpin money and go out and get you a peice of this!!
4,It was my first.,"I don't really know what to say here. This was my first pop filter and I use it when I record my music. It's perfect for what it's meant to be used for and nice with the easy set up and bendable neck. One problem I did have with it was that it didn't fit on where I wanted it to on my mic stand even after unscrewing and tightening the knob to hold it firmly onto whichever pole you want to put it on. But other than that, I would recommend this pop filter to whomever wants a good one."
5,VERY HEAVY,"Hi, I must say that this product is as described. It is very heavy.You can place any stud or stand, you can adjust to any position, and the flexible neck is pretty stiff, so it is unlikely to step down from his position.Antipop filter has a pair of screws which can be disassembled to replace the mesh in the case of damage .Hola, debo decir que este producto es tal como lo describen. Es muy pesado.Se puede colocar a cualquier paral o stand, se puede ajustar a cualquier posiciòn, y el cuello flexible es bastante rigido, por lo cual es poco probable que se baje de su posiciòn.El filtro antipop tiene un par de tornillos en donde se puede desarmar para reemplazar la malla, en el caso de que se dañe."
3,cant tel it helped,"with this product, I cant tell any a think that the sounds are filtered out I think it was a waste of money"
3,Good Product but expensive,"I think the product itself is very good, feels like a fairly good high quality product however I rated 3 stars because I think the price is a little too high. If you can find this product for a cheaper price, BUY IT! it's worth it."
5,EXCELLENT FOR FIRST TIME CAR BUYERS,This book should be MANDATORY for first time car buyers!!! It opened my eyes to many things. Let's you REALLY know what car dealers don't want you to know. Because of this book I actually decided to go with a car buying service (Car Bargains) to get the best deal on a 2003 model.
3,Not as Wonderful as Advertised,"I have taken very good care of my skin, starting when I was a teen. I've taken precautions against the sun, moisturized and used sunscreens; I am 60 years old. After hearing raves about this product, I purchased a container and followed manufacturer's directions and used it for ~30 days. I saw and experienced no changes in my facial skin, so I used it on the skin of my hands. Again, no difference pre- and post- application, trial period ~15 days. I'm back to using Lancome and L'Oreal products."
4,Great gift,"This puzzle was a gift for my four year old nephew. He loved it! Great quality, design and bright color."
3,Construction puzzle,Cute puzzle but not cut well so it is difficult to get pieces to sit right and not pop out. We do a ton of puzzles and the quality is middle of the road. I would buy their puzzle that come on a wood board instead of this kind.
3,Good puzzle for little boys,"My son likes this construction puzzle, so it's a winner. The picture is colorful and well drawn. My son's a construction vehicle fan so he loves identifying each machine. The pieces themselves seemed like normal puzzle pieces to me. There were no design defects and each piece fit normally. It would be nice if the pieces were made of sturdy wood so that it could be used more easily on carpet. There is no problem on tile or our kitchen table of course. The puzzle was age appropriate and just about perfect for my son."
4,It is working so far..,this product its not bad at all. it is working though. I feel my bra a little tighter. and dont worry people im not one of those fake invented customers that are created so people could buy this product i just decided to give it a try and so far so good Ive been using it for abour a week or two as directed on the instructions and I have to say I do feel like their a little heavier but not much change though this product doesnt make miracles I'm just trying to be real though but I do hope they get bigger. im hoping for a small C. right now I think im a small B or B cup. ill be updating for sure.
5,A voice like no other.,"What a voice! What a soothing delivery, every song on this cd is memorable; her diction is impeccable. Ms. Bradford is a true artist."
1,Hypocrisy,"This book of Bettelheim's makes me particularly mad because as a teenager I read it to see if I wanted to attend that place. And it sounded so lovely that I thought, oh this is the place for me to get better.Too bad, Betttelheim didn't mention his use of physical abuse and shaming. Too bad, he didn't mention that the O.S. was really an abusive cult and that his successor was completely brainwashed by him."
1,CAN'T USE,"I needed a 3 amp, 125 volt fuse for a string of outdoor lights, but these didn't fit- too big. Good thing they were cheap."
2,very dense,"I had to read this for a class. it is a very dense book. as an english major, I consider myself a fairly good reader, but this book took alot of effort. Zall works with what he's got but it is not a very good read.very boring."
5,Fun Game!,"I played Argue for the first time with a group of friends at a party and it did not disappoint! It takes quite the process to get through this game as it takes two rounds with many steps in the arguing and voting process, so I would not recommend it for elementary-aged children. Argue would be great for high schoolers on the debate team (my husband was on the team many years ago, which proved helpful). For adults, it was just great fun. We were almost brought to tears with laughter a couple times."
5,Makes it Fun to Argue~!,"This game is all about opinions, its a great game and i really enjoyed it! Its a great conversation piece that people will talk about for days on end!"
4,metabarons & jodorowsky,"does this series have many similarities with dune? yes. is this series still badass? yes. metabarons is an awesome read, filled with lots of goodness lacking in most american comics. this takes the brooding, twister and perverse hero and seems to make it feel fresh, as opposed to the now cliched dark hero.heavy metal likes to think it is on the same level as this series, but it is not. it is simply sci-fi themed softcore p0rn, and who reads that for a good story? if you like brainy and (overall) original sci-fi action that blows star wars and most sci-fi movies out of the water, check this out."
5,Excellent for all Communicators & Toastmasters,"As an Advanced Toastmaster Gold, the book has help me and my fellow Toastmaster club members to develop communication skills. As a supplement to club activity, this book will help a person achieve their goals. Buy this book and join a local Toastmaster club and develop your communication skills."
1,I've seen better sunglasses at bad gas stations,"For $5.99, I wasn't expecting a lot. As a matter of fact, I was expecting very little. Kudos to the manufacturer/seller then, for disappointing me DESPITE my pragmatic attitude.These are so flimsy, that I was afraid of breaking them simply by holding them in my hands. What's more, the promised ""case"" (which would have been nothing but a pouch made of cheap fabric) was missing from the package. Very disappointing, because after taking one look at this lemon, I knew that the pouch would be the only thing of value in this order. I contacted Amazon, arranged a return, and I'm happy for it.I'll be fulfilling all my optometry needs at the gas station, thank you very much."
2,Junk,"These glasses came on time, but, when I opened them, I soon realized why they were priced so low; They're complete garbage. The arch in the middle wasn't centered, and the mirror was part chipped upon arrival. Also, the frames are so flimsy anything would risk breaking them. Even though they are cheap, I would not suggest buying them."
3,Really?,These sunglasses are very sturdy. That being said the style is very bland. They do not look like they were built to be stylish. They are VERY small and i would not recommend them to anyone who has a larger head even slightly larger. The glasses are so small i am going to attempt to return them right away.
1,Don't buy these sunglasses,"I've only had these sunglasses for a week, and already the nose rest has fallen off of the glasses and the frame is beginning to bend more than an acceptable amount."
4,"great, inexpensive glasses",Great pair of sunglasses for the price. Good fit and don't look cheap. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a cheap pair of aviators.
1,Defective piece,"Looks very cheep and the one that I got has lot of scratches. Thought of returning, but felt wasting time on returning this $1.20 item."
3,son bonitos,Están hechos con calidad de material.Los recomiendo.Ademas da al rostro una apariencia seductora y aguerrida.Ideal para andar de paseo en moto
2,wow,i got these in the mail and i opened the box . I almost broke the arms on them because there so thin! but they are dark
4,For the price they're amazing,Like I said for the price they're totally worth it. The nose portion is kind of odd and it isn't a perfect fit but I guess you can adjust it along with the things that go over your ears. They look cool and you can totally fool people as to how much you paid. Best part when I will lose or break them I won't cry.
2,Too small,"Made for small/narrow heads. I need wider ones, these were not worth my money but if you have a small head they may work for you."
5,He loves them!,"I was kinda scared on how they would actually appear if they were ugly or damaged due to the price, but they look really good! It comes with a neat little pouch and they come in a plastic ""airforce"" baggy-which is also neat. But I just gave it to my boyfriend right out of the packaging box and he loves them!"
5,"Amazing, touching, biography that is a must read for everyon","This will be short and sweet..Dennis Hollman's work is an amzing, touching, from the heart work. Mixed into this biography are some honest and vivid scenes from his life, fantastic humor, and much much more......I would recommend this book to everyone...great job Dennis!"
3,Good info if you don't know what you're doing,I got this because I was interested in upgrading my first Glock. This shows many parts and how to install them. Helped me decide what parts to get. I also realized that I can install them all myself.
2,so-so,"Being a huge Beck fan, I found this single to be quite a disappointment. ""Pay No Mind"" has always been one of my favorites,however the rest of the songs are pretty much throw-aways that even the obsessed could do without. Check out the much better ""Loser"" or ""Beercan"" singles instead."
5,Limited Edition Exclusive Collection,12 of his greatest performances brought together as a one disc collection that was exclusive to a chain.
3,Know what features you get,"Pluses - easy setup, speed dial (9), distinctive ring for special #s, forward call from one handset to another, decent voice quality, 'message record' or 'just announce' choiceMinuses - cannot use both handsets at the same time to speak in parallel, no speakerphone, no intercom, having problems with time changing on its own on the phone despite having set it a few times."
1,Junk!,"We first purchased an AT&T 2.4 mhz cordless, and took that back because it worked horribly. Then we went with Uniden. AWFUL! So then we moved on to this phone, and right away had problems. One handset would not work at all, so we returned it for a new one, thinking it was a fluke. Well, both handsets work now - - terribly. The echo is unbearable. It's near impossible to hear the person on the other end. All 4 ring types are just annoying. There is a huge delay when entering numbers or answering. Just plain not worth it at all. We could not regret a purchase more. I'm convinced there is just no such thing as a truly good cordless phone. I've been e-mailing more than ever!"
4,GOOD OLD FIFTIES !,"A good old fashioned adventure movie from 1955, Splendid photography in CinemaScope of HONG KONG, a fine script by Ernest K.Gann,Clark Gable and Susan Hayward at their best, who could ask for more...it's much better than the rather ridiculous John Wayne's ""Blood Alley"" filmed...in California !"
5,Excellent condition,The DVD I received was in excellent condition and was delivered much sooner than I expected!
2,Tired melodrama,"Jane Hoyt (Susan Hayward), a self-sacrificing, loyal wife, enlists the aid of Hank Lee (Clark Gable), a roguish gambler with a heart of gold, to find and rescue her missing husband from Communist China. Filled with stock characters (ie, the policeman who secretly admires the dashing criminal and helps him in the end, the comical drunken sailors who hate ""dames"") and stock situations (passions flare during a big storm). There is some nice photography, but it couldn't hold my interest."
4,"YOU ARE IN GOOD HAND'S, WITH THE KING.","THIS MOVIE'S PHOTOGRAPHY (HONG KONG, THE HARBOR, THE OCEAN, AND CLOSE UPS)WAS CUTTING EDGE IN 1955, AND IS STILL BREATHTAKING TODAY (WITH A GOOD VHS/TV). CLARK GABLE GIVES A GREAT PERFORMANCE AS A MAN'S MAN, READY TO HELP THE GREAT LOOKING (SUSAN HAYWARD), A STRONG LADY, SLOWLY WEAKENING TO ""THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE"", BUT STILL HOLDING TRUE TO HER MISSING/PRISONER (GENE BARRY)HUSBAND. MICHAEL RENNIE PLAYS THE GOOD COP, WITH A SENSE OF ADVENTURE, AND THE REST OF THE CAST ARE EVIL, HUMOROUS, LOYAL, AND ENTERTAINING, IN THIS IS, A GREAT 1950'S, COLOR MOVIE."
3,Review,It was good but could of said it was a French version but still good..at least you could set your audio.
1,NO NO NO,"the original ratio is 1:2,35 = cinemascope also on DVD, But here on Blu-ray is the ratio fu..ing 1:1,78 = 16:9 TV-widescreen) my question is WHY !!!!! don't buy this box !!!"
2,Ok but Canadian Cut,Bought this back before the US release of these movies. This is the Canadian cut. Will play in US region players but not the best cuts of the film so might want to look at US release first.
3,A classic but dated,"This book is certainly the gold standard in syntax books, but it's pretty dated. For example, the discussion of specifiers is way out of date (nowadays, specifiers are for subject positions), it's discussion of movement is also bound up in early GB theory, which is difficult. Radford's more recent textbooks are much more up to date."
5,Soothing Music,Tim Janis has a way of capturing feelings and expressing them in his music. He is very up lifting and relaxing. I would highly recommend this wonderful cd to anyone that likes symphony or classical music.
5,CD - Beautiful America,Received CD in perfect condition and in the 3 to 4 mail days adverised - was extrememly happy with product & service. LJK
4,meditation music,the songs sre shorter than I would like but some of then are truly beautiful and great to meditate to.
5,Uplifting Americana,I first heard this music on PBS during a fundraiser where they combined the music with images from national parks in the West. Just amazing. It was the most uplifting and inspiring music I had ever heard. How perfectly American.
5,A Pleasant Discovery !,"This is good stuff! The music is very melodic and on quite a grand scale with an impressive range of real instruments being used. My favourite tracks are the title track and ""Where Horizons Meet"". Don't be put off just because you've never heard of this composer- sometimes you have to take a chance and I think it's quite likely you won't be disappointed.ALSO RECOMMENDED: Mehdi ~ Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 ..A True Gem...Samples are at SoothingMusic,Com...Just Listen."
5,Fabulous,"""Snoopy: The Musical"" is probably the best Peanuts special since the ""Great Pumpkin."" The songs are creative, fun, and thought provoking at times. The big shock of this video is the fact that Snoopy has inner vocal monologue. One of the songs, ""Believe in You"", was used in the special that honored Jim Henson just after his death."
2,Not up to usual snoopy standards.,"I love Snoopy and the whole Peanuts gang, yet I couldn't love this video. The beauty of Snoopy's character is that he doesn't need to have a voice for the audience to know what he is thinking. Snoopy's mannerisms say it all. It was as big of a mistake as having the teacher speak in actual words when Peppermint Patty was learning to ice skate."
1,Does NOT fit stock Camry 95-96 V6! NOT DIRECT FIT!,"This pipe does NOT fit Camry V6 95-96. The inner diameter of catalyst outlet is smaller than the original one: Magnaflow's diameter is 5.8cm, original - 6.5cm. There is no way to fit it to original center pipe, so stay away from it.If you look for REAL direct fit to replace stock front pipe on Camry V6 95-96 I'd recommend to get Walker 50448 or Eastern Catalytic 40264."
3,McCoy Tyner @ Sweet Basil,Here is McCoy at his high energy self. Really great explorations and probably one of the last few recordings with him cranking it out before he started to quite down and change his style. Unfortunately whether the recording is wonky or it is just the way Aaron Scott is interpreting but the cymbal work overshadows alot of the bass (Avery Sharpe) and keys at times. I want to hear a better balance almost all the way through the date.
3,This book is for professional developer.,"I expected this book to have some content related to scripting languanges such as Perl but unfortunately it doesn't. It is mainly dealing with creating and connecting database using C++ or Java which is definately tool for professional developers. It would be nicer if it covered the database connection using Perl or some other scripting language which is a much easier way to do the CGI work. Also, it only covers mSQL."
5,The BEST Database Book on Linux!,"This book brings you 90% of what you need to develop a database solution on Linux.The first two chapter will change the way you look at a databse, and the third will consolidate your knowledge on SQL. The other chapters deal with Web Integration and other topics.Like a friend of mine ( +ORC, the Red Cracker ) always says, hystorical knowledge is a must! And this books puts you into the stage of database development. After reading this book, you'll know it ALL!"
3,"The Need for comprehensive SLACKware Software, on Disk|!","I found this book VERY informative in the actual installlation process of Linux --- <Slackware LINUX, that is>, but, did find that the CD-ROM Disk that came along with it a bit OOD <Out-Of-Date>...I mean, Kernel 2.0.0, with Version 3.5...At the time,...(that is, circa 1997), it must have been ""cutting edge""! But, now...it is 'Old Hat'...(and, not even 'Old RedHAt'....i.e., not even capable of psuedo-REDHatPkg.Manager).Jt/mS"
3,informative but insular,"I started to read der spiegel on line as it provided some of the most insightful articles about the euro crisis I'd seen. Otherwise the coverage strikes me as being surprisingly inward looking or ......well, insular ( surprising because insular is I think what many Germans think about us here in Britain). Also it is a news magazine not a newspaper so take a while to catch up with events. Even the online edition seems to be subject to 9 to 5 hours and you will get no new story posted much before 10.00am european time and nothing at all at weekends. Still it is an excellent and readable way to appreciate the German view of things, and interesting from that viewpoint."
4,Interesting Read,"An excellent analysis of the Nazi era, that uses real-life people and such off-beat topics as Humor. It also explains very well and succinctly about the way people lived under the Nazis. The section on Business was appreciated as well since not many in-print books explain about the effect of the 1933 seizure of power on the Business. However it would be better if there was more in relation to the Jews."
1,Dont waste your money,The good reviews here must be written by family members or friends. I was trying to find good poetry or good medicine or good instruction inside but it never materialized.
2,Autographed copy missing autograph!,"Although this item was advertised and priced as a collectible, the first copy had no signature because the page that was supposedly signed was torn out of the book. When I notified the seller, they agreed to send another with a signature. However, when the second copy arrived, it was signed, but not by the author. Instead, it was signed with a woman's name who seems to have no connection to the book at all. During the last communication I had with the seller, she agreed to locate and send out the autographed copy. Still nothing, so I expect we will not be receiving what we paid for."
5,Lets you have a use for the paper,"I saw this calendar at a chain bookstore, but they stopped printing after 2005. So, I turned to trusty Amazon.com The calendar has a different piece of origami every day and the printing on the back matches the design - spots for turtles, faux wood grain for boxes, etc. Now, the only bad thing is that I have lots of designs on my desk at work and it may lead people to think you're not constructive! Designs take maybe 3-5 minutes to fold. A high recommendation."
5,Letter From Home,Carolyn Hart books always pick me up when I am in a reading slump. At times I finding myself getting into a reading slump and certain authors just pick me up and she is certainly one of them.
5,ssweet!,"fair trade, better than fair price and double blind taste test with name brand was fair and couldn't tell the diffence. i will purchase this product again."
5,A good product,I Have been using sitz bath for a long time. The old one(Different brand) was broken after 10 years.This is my new replacement.It has the same design and the same size as my old one.I feel the quality is as good as the old one too.The water bag is not necessary. I just simply use the bath. Recommend to anyone who needs it.
3,Does Not Seem Durable--But Not Bad,"I initially didn't give this a very charitable review, but it's holding up OK.The plastic supports turn the seat area white, but they have not broken through so far.Overall, it's not that bad; it get's the job done-hence the 3 stars."
3,It just ok,This album is not good not bad. Its average. They have solos they play right but there are not good tracks in the end (there is no comparison to older albums). If you are new to Motorhead start with Overkill and Ace of spades which are masterpieces.
3,broken case,"Cd was fine. Delivery was faster than i expected, which is, of course, a good thing. But the case was broken. Not happy about that since I keep my collections in pristine order. Luckily, I had a spare case."
3,3.5 Stars,"This is pretty typical Motörhead. Nothing beyond what is expected...the typical, heavy, groove infused, borderline metal,rock n' roll that is always a good listen."
4,Napoleon and Samantha,I love this movie because it was filmed in my home town and they used my step-dad's store as one on the places to film. I got to know Johnny Whitaker and Will Geer and talked with Michael Douglas. Jodie Foster was only 9 but I enjoyed watching her work. This entire movie is special to my heart and it always will be.
4,Easy Install,I'm a 64 yr old grandma and I think this was really easy to put together -The only problem was when I hammered the pegs in the top I hit alittle to hard and it cracked the top in one spot - not that bab - but enough for me to know it's there - they should say something about that - I bet if I had called they would have replaced - but I just put a vase over the crack.It was exactly what I was looking for and the price was FANTASTICDelivery was quick
4,A very good value,Purchased this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Not too hard to put together and very sturdy and well made. Would purchase again.
5,would buy again,"own these in black and brown. great slim watch that can be worn for casual, business and formal attire. great addition."
5,THESE TAPES ARE BRILLIANT,"HEY, ALL THESE BACKYARD WRESTLING TAPES ARE BRILLIANT. IF U LIKE HARDCORE, XTREME, HI-FLYING BRUTAL WRESTLING THIS TAPE IS FOR YOU. I AM A BACKYARD WRESTLER MYSELF AND I DO ALOT OF XTREME STUFF BUT I WOULD NEVER DO ANY OF THE THINGS THESE GUYS DO!! THESE VIDEOS ARE AMAZING!"
4,Darwinism at its finest!,"Hell, i like these tapes. I bought Vol.1&2 brand new at [local store] for only [price] (no, it wasn't on the clearance rack either..lol).Anyway, I think these are great. I love nothing more than watching idiots be idiots. I wish they would show some of them dying or something. What a great way to rid the world of stupidity, making morons maim/possibly kill each other, while entertaining the sane human beings at the same time..."
1,Far Below Par,"I have been a fan of Boris for many years and this Calendar is simply not up to par. It is uninspired and feels more like cookie-cutter works just to fill the pages to get a paycheck. Personally, only the cover art (one of the months inside) is worthy to put on my wall. The art, while all new, is merely rehashing of the same poses, backgrounds, colors, faces, etc... just switched around to appear, on the surface, as something new. My advice is buy one of his earlier artbooks for about the same price and get some quality artwork. Julie Bell, who has always been hit and miss with me for the same reason this Calendar is. Unfortunatley, I had assumed that Boris would bring the overall quality up, but instead they both fell down to new hights of ""Humdrum"" art."
4,Boris Vallejo/Julie Bell 2006 Fantasy Calendar Review,"The quality of the paper & the image reproduction value are great. The only thing that kind-of bugs me is that the image is broken by the fold. It's great to have a larger image, but it's distracting to have the fold break the continuity. I think I'd rather have a smaller image & have it intact."
4,Billy Harper blows his way...,"This jazz pushes high tense energy in to you. That takes time to absorb it and requires several close listens. You may not be able to finish the disc to its end at first playing. But that is not to say that Harper's playing is a no sense blowing. Neither it is an easy listening. Music calls for preparation both mental and mind-opening. What can also be unusual is a two-drummer alignment that creates interesting polyrhythms fibers.Tracks are really long - 13:37, 21:56, 12:45, 7:59 and 4:15. So, do not expect to slip through the track you do not like fast enough. But once you are in the music you will get pleasure from the whole sound scenery. Recording quality is good, thanks to Evidence Music.Is that an example of creative music? Hardly, but, anyway, try to enjoy it."
2,So so game,"Much is left out of this game that could have made it a GREAT GAME, BUT the developerstook the CHEAP route and loaded it with an ACCOUNTING program that makes it boring, with low replay.Pros........ nice graphics, intricate chart of the Caribbean.Neg......... The program doesn't let you relax, you are always trying to keep ahead ofthe enormous expenses throw at you.Your wife is of little use, and is made out to be a SHREW, instead of adependable life partner.The Pirate element is weak, could have been much more realistic.You cannot spend money for a house, or clothes etc, just property /businesses."
4,This game is awesome!,"This game has a lot of strategy included to make it one of the best games I have ever played. A few years ago, I had over twenty-million gold and many large convoys, but we uninstalled it. Now though, Ihave it on a computer and am playing away!"
3,interesting pc game,the scenarios are good. without the scenarios it would be a lot less interesting. Trading is probably the main part of this game; though fighting pirates and tradesmen can be fun. Pity you cannot begin the game as a pirate - you can only give ships to a pirate for a share in the spoils.Unless you are on super-fast mode this is a long game - even if you are playing in a scenario it can be long and drawn out.Also noticed that while the game is has good visual effects; the objects are out of proportion.
1,No wind?,A game dealing with sailing ships that does not bother with wind is like an airplane simulator that doesn't bother with gravity.Nothing but a cheesy trading game in sailor drag.
3,Crazy sizing,Sizes and fit are all over the place. I will not order any more shoes that showUS/European/UK sizes....they are not consistent to any sizing structure.
4,Perfect gym bag!,"The Ogio 55 liter duffle bag is perfect for the gym! I can fit everything I need for my morning workouts, AND get ready for work from the gym's lockeroom! Believe it or not, I can fit a full-size towel, toiletries (shampoo, soap, etc.), work clothes, boots, blow-dryer and still have room to spare."
3,"High quality, limited usage","Though I enjoy my Cuisinart food processor very much, and was a little too gung-ho when I first bought it as I purchased all the different blades and attachments, after several months of usage I can say that you probably don't need this 1mm blade. I use it to slice carrot, radishes, cucumbers, and peppers for salads but it does slice extremely thin and the 2mm is not much different. It is high quality and much overpriced and ultimately I will struggle over the life of the unit to get my money out of this one as there just are not that many times when you want razor thin food that doesn't turn to mush. The 2mm blade helps to keep the food more solid and provides more crunch. If you are a caterer and need to stretch food by cutting it ultra thin then this one's for you but average cooks can use the 2mm and be just fine. If anything I would recommend the larger slicing blades as they can be used for meats and stir-frys, while this one merely just sits on the shelf."
4,Werewolves oh BABY!,Breathless! That's what I thought. The ending is very disturbing. It's a bit different from the drop off ending of his first novel TELL ME YOUR NAME. This one is gorier and morefrightening. It's a very sad book as well in some places. There is a charachter that reminds me of my uncle who I got teary eyed when he died. But it's action packed and reads in 3rd and first person in different parts. Eric has an intriguing mind to come up with a mobster novel and meld it into werewolves.I reccomend it to anyone who loves blood and guts and a lot of heart.
5,Amazing Adviata book,A must read for those who are attracted to Advaita and to the end of Spiritual seeking!
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!,"Amazing book. It feels like ""true self"" wrote a book and send it to me to clear my confusion after my near death experience. I don't only 100% believe in this book I also did have the experience. I've order 5 more to give them to my friends. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
5,Highly recommended,"This is the clearest book yet by a `Westerner' on advaita / the non-dual perspective, a subject about which so much confusion exists. I really enjoyed the very patient & amazingly comprehensive approach taken by the author, Leo Hartong. Chapter by chapter, he looks at just about every aspect of non-dualism, gently exposing both the obvious & less obvious misunderstandings along the way.The book is written more as a beautiful sharing than from any position of authority... as Leo writes, ""These words are nothing but a gentle reminder from yourself to yourself that you are the awakened one"".There is also a great forum at http://www.awakeningtothedream.com/ ."
5,When One Book is Enough,"Memory tells that I once seemed to visit leo's beautiful internet site (awakeningtothedream.com) and read his book... not knowing 'advaita'... though it is ever clear... like looking in a mirror... a smile still seems to linger. As a waterfall takes no credit for being a waterfall, leo takes no credit for the writing - nor the insight. This book will be read from many perspectives and, in some cases, it will seem that a door opens into a doorless void that needs no words to express itself... it is not what you think it is, yet it seems to be... smile. If it seems you have read this far, perhaps this One book is enough... Love"
4,A way to relate,"Finally, a book that is able to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western thought. Some Eastern ""concepts"" seem so esoteric to the Western mind, but Mr. Hartong is able to guide you through these and into the realization of what is the ultimate. I would highly suggust this book to readers who find themselves continually searching, but not necessarilly understanding many books of Eastern Philosophy. Thank You Leo."
5,Clear and simple pointing to This.,"If you enjoy struggle, hardship and the belief that the path to enlightenment must be long and difficult, then this is not the book for you!Leo Hartong has the same rare gift of communication that Alan Watts had. Leo is able to explain in fun, clear and interesting ways the utter simplicity of the awakening that has so many people confused and running around in circles chasing their tails. A direct transmission of Mind to Mind (not two) happens in the reading of the book as the reader recognizes and experiences the truths that Leo is pointing to, as these truths are self evident. Leo also liberally quotes from many traditions and teachers to illustrate his points. This is a very enjoyable book to read and it cuts through a lot of the confusion around advaita, enlightenment and awakening. I highly recommend it!"
1,Manufacturer is out of business - don't buy this product!,I bought this product so that I could power my laptop in the car. I bought other Coleman products in the past and bought this one because of the Coleman name. It worked great for 3 months. Then it just stopped working. It was still under warranty so I called Coleman for a replacement. They said the product was made by another company that licensed Coleman's name. They wouldn't replace it or refund my money. Amazon wouldn't replace it or refund my money because I was outside of their 30 day window. So now I have a very expensive piece of junk that nobody will support. I won't be buying Coleman products any more!
1,DON'T BUY IT,"The problems with this program as well as all the others by H&R; Block are too numerous to mention here, but take it from someone who learned the hard way, don't waste your money on this product.I reported bugs in both the federal and state editions 3 years ago and they STILL haven't been corrected. One of which is the employer ID number allows for 14 characters but some employers have 15 or more. Another, if you go back and make a correction and forget to TELL the program to recalculate, everything that follows, including your taxs due or your refund amount will be incorrect. Isn't this what you pay for? A program that ELIMINATES errors instead of creating them? If you buy this product, DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR RETURN."
2,My Third Year Using TaxCut ... and it still is very clumsy,"Next year I am going back to Turbo Tax. I have been doing my own tax returns for over 20 years now and have been using PC software to help for over 12 of those years.Tax Cut is clumsy and buggy compared to my earlier experiences with TurboTax. I'm not going to go through a blow-by-blow of the problems with this program, but suffice to say that I think it is a hard to use program which makes the pain of tax time worse, not better. Back to TurboTax for me!"
3,It's ok but........,"This year TaxCut has an update problem. I cannot get the latest tax update from the TaxCut program, I get an error message. I went to their site, they recognize they have a problem but following their instructions I still had no luck. After a little searching I find you have to uninstall TaxCut before you do the update, this is for both Federal and State returns. I think the time I had to reinstall the Windows ME operating system it was easier."
1,PROBLEM WITH SPYWARE WARMING POPUP,"I have been using TaxCut in the last few years and I liked it. It is cheap compared to to Turbo Tax. However, the 2004 version is filled with popup when it is running. My virus and spyware software are up-to-date and all other programs are running fine without any popup. May be it's switching time."
2,Rebate ripoff,"I have purchased Taxcut Deluxe and Taxcut State and applied for the rebate for the State program $19.99) as advertised. I sent TaxCut all the required information, de codes, the sales receipt and some form I had to fill out.After 6 weeks I received it back in the original envelope with a letter from TaxCut stating that I had not sent them the sales receipt and codes. They only sent me back the form. They are obviously lying and they won't give me my refund. I suspect the whole rebate thing is a scam and consumer's fraud.No more Taxcut for me. The program is not that great anyway."
2,Amateurish program,"This is my third year of using Tax Cut. While it does get the job done for me, I continue to be amazed at the amateurish programming. Textboxes overlap labels, text is not formatted to fit on the form, controls are not aligned, and on and on. It appears this was a high school project for introduction to programming. While the input forms are laughable, somehow, the results have been correct and the IRS accepted the filing. TurboTax is obviously done by professional programmers but often has technical problems. The amazing thing is that these big companies cannot create a decent tax program after many years of trying. I think if either of these companies started listening to customers, they would learn a great deal and might produce a much better product. The only recommendation I can give is to do your taxes by hand."
1,Problems with TaxCut,"I have been using taxcut for 6 years. This year it dropped one of my deductions. The child was listed in the interview and appeared to be included, but was not submitted in the e-filing. This is pathetic. NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT."
4,filed with no problems,I have filed with no problems. It comes with deduction pro which helps if you choose to itemize. Tax updates are free of charge.
2,Unable to update program or get State files.,"I don't know if this is just a bad day but their servers fail when updating files and also when attempting to purchase the State program. You would think Feb 1 wouldn't be the worst day but it is failing each time I try. Not like doing taxes isn't stressfull enough, but HR Block isn't helping either."
1,Don't buy if you plan to file before February,"As others have said, there is a product update that will not allow you to file your taxes until sometime if February. If you don't plan to file until then, no problem. Entering an uncomplicated return like mine was easy. I've used this for the past few years with no problems, so I was a bit disappointed."
3,It might be the IRS...,"The IRS updates its forms over the entire tax year, with some forms not finalized until the last minute. My point is that some of the problems people are experiencing may not be the software, but the IRS updates."
1,Pretty bad,"This is my 5th year using Tax Cut. In the past I've been very happy with it. This year however, the updater is just awful. This disc, as purchased, isn't close to being up to date. After several attempts to run ""update"" and not being able to do so because of an ""unexpected error"", I went to their web site for a down load that took 2 hour and 45 minutes.Now that I've run the updater the program is still saying I can't file untill I fix some items, items that I KNOW have been completed correctly !!!I just might return the product directly to H&H; Block for a full refund and buy Turbo next year."
1,No help for Mac Users,"I would have preferred this product to Turbo Tax. Since I am in the 10% of the market that uses Macs, HR Block is ignoring my. So I'm off to buy Turbo Tax. Maybe next year HR Block will consider those of us who buy the more expensive Mac systems."
2,Please disregard my prior review,"After further review, it seems that the program does, indeed, calculate the tax correctly, it is just very hard to follow it's method until yuo print out dozens of pages of worksheets.This year's version seems intent upon offering extra cost services at every opportunity, which I find annoying.It is very hard to see the tax form before you print it, which is also annoying.Otherwise, it's a good choice. Importing data from prior years is simple and access to irs instructions is a plus."
1,Used Turbo Tax in the past - switched to Tax Cut this year,"I made the sad mistake of switching to HR Block Tax Cut this year after using Turbo Tax for the past several years. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!Fortunately I have some accounting experience. The mistakes were rampant, examples: It copied all the expenses I had put in for a rental property I own and ADDED them to a small Royalty payment I get from a oil stock. The result of that was a major error (underpayment) in my taxes. I went in and had to manually fix that and discovered it had ignored the depreciation on my rental property. When I tried to do the State Tax I discovered that there were many errors (never asked in the ""worksheet"" interview such as PERA payments my wife made that are credits, nor did it ever give the state credit for pension payments. To call them about anything cost $10 a call. Be forewarned.... DONT USE TAX CUT!!! It is really a lousy program!!"
3,Not very user-friendly,"TaxCut enables you to cut down the number of hours you have to spend on tax prep, but its confusing instructions often leave you frustrated. I find the free TaxAct (taxact.com) actually more user-friendly and more flexible when you want to enter information on the forms yourself."
1,WARNING! Incomplete software. Unable to file until February,"I have always filed using TurboTax and thought I'd try this out. I spent 3 hours trying to get the K-1 form to function properly. I finally got it. I completed my entire tax return only to find out in the final check that TaxCut is incomplete and will not be complete until February. I can not file until this ""error"" is fixed and I update with new version. This product should not have been sold in the first place. Save your money, and more importantly, your time... buy TurboTax"
3,"Good Program, but Can't Download State","I have been using TurboTax for the past 3 years, but this year, it kept freezing up when I tried to e-file. The customer support was kind of spotty, so when I saw TaxCut, I decided to give it a try. I found this program be easier to use than TurboTax and the refund came out to be exactly the same. I had no problems e-filing, I got a response from the IRS about 12 hours after filing, instead of 24-48 hours. The only problem I had is downloading the State program, after about 3 tries, I guess I'll have to buy it over the phone. Seems like it's an off year for all tax programs, here's hoping they fix it for tax year 2006. I think I'll stay with this one for a while."
5,Works perfectly again,"I don't know why some people seem to be having trouble this year, but I experienced no updating problems or anything else this year. I've used TaxCut for about 5-6 years and I've never had a problem with it. I like the way it runs through the various parts of the return and forms and I've always found it logical and pretty easy to navigate and make changes.And for what it's worth, none of the federal forms are final until Jan 31. It's rare that things are changed after they release them in late-Dec or early Jan, but they are officially drafts until Jan 31. So it's not surprising to have the program stall you until a finalized form is ready.Avergae time of deposit after e-Filing: about 9 days since I've been using this software."
1,Disappointed,"After using Taxcut Deluxe software for 4 years, I was disappointed with the current 2004 version. The software showed an Error message for the Charitable Worksheet, simply because you are expected to wait until February to download an update! It must be corrected before filing. So, I did more research and ended using TurboTax online free e-filing for my federal return and I paid the $19.95 fee to e-file my state return; which is the method I plan to use next year. No more Taxcut software expense for me."
1,Incomplete Software Package,"When running the final error check the software threw up an error. The explanation was ""When we released Tax-Cut, Charitable Worksheet was not yet finalized. A program update containing the final form will be available by early February. Please update your program at that time, then come back to error check so we can review your return again....You must fix this problem before filing."" So much for an early refund."
1,Very Poor Program,I have used Turbo Tax in past years but liked the rebates offered with Tax Cut so I decided to try it. BAD idea! The screen has many display issues. The print outs cut off text. The import of data duplicated many items. I will be going back to Turbo Tax next year and may even get it to finish out this year.
3,"Its ok, just taxes after all","Used it in the past and picked up another copy for this year. Imported my last years info. Noticed that trying to jump from 1 section to another isn't user friendly as in past editions and the info screens made me laugh, guys name was Richard Head. Not sure if that was a joke or not.I see other people have slammed it for reasons like not having all of the updates until February, well that happens every year with this product and TurboTax, IRS makes changes all the time and need to have the current files finallized.Either buy it, Turbo or the free TaxAct. Or grab a pencil and paper and do it by hand...either way you have until April 15.Oh and if you do receive a large refund, remember that you just gave the US government an interest free loan."
2,Productivity while using TaxCut,"I am using this program third year. This year, I find it as very slow running/responding. My OS system Windows XP SP2, my computer processor: Intel II, RAM - 384 MB.I am unhappy with the program performance."
5,works for me,"This product was adequate for my needs - easy to use and navigate, ran without errors/issues and was realistically priced. The major pluses for me was the ability to import data from last year's taxcut data which eliminated excess typing and the comparison of 2004 year to 2003 data. I will use this product again next year."
1,Do it on PAPER and SAVE MONEY. You'll have to buy STATE,"Save yourself the hassle and do it on paper or for free online. Even though the software appears to include state tax info, youll have to download your state for an extra $24.95. AVOID."
4,Taxcut is an excellent product.,"I have used Taxcut for the past five out of six years (one year trying Turbotax, I quickly returned to Taxcut!) I also complete taxes for numerous others using this software.You do not need to be a professional to use this product for your tax filing. However, I strongly suggest that if you cannot sit down and complete your taxes the good, old fashioned paper way...you should seek professional assistance and not even bother with any software.Tax laws are constantly changing and if you do not know the right questions to ask...chances are you're not getting a full return.Money is a terrible thing to waste!!"
1,Not for my dog,"I ordered these for my labradoddle and she is about 50 lbs and 3 years old. I gave her one of these as a treat and after she was done with it, she cam in and minutes later vomited it all up over the silk carpet.I tried one more time on a different day at a different time and I got the same result.I guess they are too greasy for my dog as we keep her on a fairly strict organic diet of high protein dog food.I would suggest trying one to see if your dog tolerates them, or else you will end up like me with a box of them.Wayne Case"
4,YOU CAN FEEL YOUR ABS WORKING OUT.,"i completly recomend this product, if you do it correctly you can feel your abs working hard. you have to be focus on your goal, be persistent and sure you see results.just only a recomendation. if you wanna see better and fast results it is very important that you burn your fat with a lot of cardio. and dont forget a good diet.because cardio is the key to see your abbs muscles bigger and nice.dont forget that.i hope this review was hepfull for youhave a nice day.cesar from cali colombia."
1,Kinda Disappointing,This really doesn't work at all. Felt no burn or anything. Waste of money for sure.
2,Disappointing,"The cover of the hardbook advertises ""9/11, Iraq, and the abuse of America's intelligence agencies"" yet a lot of the book feels like a history lesson. The author has a tendency to provide extensive backgrounds and histories for each and every person, organization, and agency involved in his book. It becomes rather tedious after the first couple of chapters. I can't swear to it but portions of this book appeared in Mr. Bamford's other books. The chapters and sections that mention the NSA are an example.Overall, I am disappointed with the book and probably will skim the remainder of it."
4,What Intelligence failure?,"It seems to me that Hans Blix and Muhammed al-Baradei correctly reported to us the likely state of Iraq's strategic weaponry and warned us against a preemptive war. The republicans are also using an incorrect definition of weapons of mass distruction. The correct definition of weapons of mass distruction only counts as WMDs those weapons which have at least the potential of killing millions of people. Using this correct definition most chemical weapons and some biologicals are NOT WMDs.I would also point out that the american attempt to produce a ""shock and awe"" effect was THEIR use of a terror tactic."
1,"Psst, Wanna know a secret?","Bamford has compiled an entire book of ""stuff that someone told me"" and ""things I read in other peoples books"". This is painful reading. Trying to figure out how he arrived at his ""facts"" is a near impossible task. There are notes about meetings from a book that was written by a person who worked with Paul O'Niel who was present at a cabinet meeting were this topic was discussed. And then there are conversations with intelligence workers who are not named that occur outside of the persons office and can't be substantiated. This is a ""I hate George Bush"" book by a person who is a hater who can write."
1,Humanity plays a part in George W. Bush's decision to take Iraq,"National Geographic itself recently referred to Saddam as one of the four worst mass murderers in 20th century history (others are Hitler, Mao Zedong and Saddam's proven idol Stalin)so deadly was Saddam's butchering of the Kurds of Iraq. After reading Bamford's book I don't feel he was in touch enough with how inhuman Saddam is. And for those who pounce on the idea that Bush just protected Israel by his Iraqi invasion remember how Saddam invaded Kuwait some years before. He (Saddam) could've just been waiting in the wings for a weak US leader (like (former president? hah!) Jimmy Carter) so he coulld have a field day attacking mideast countries again. Good Bush acted when he did in 2003."
1,Bamford Caught in Lie - Not Even 1 Star,"Bamford's main claim in this work is that Bush's pro-Israel policy (the rants of an anti-Semite of the worst kind), started in January 2001, is the ""main cause"" of 9/11.However, if Mr. Bamford were writing a book of facts, and not anti-Semitic and anti-Bush slander, he would realize that bin Laden was launching the 9/11 plan in 1998 and 1999, when Bill Clinton was in office, and he was kowtowing to Arafat and letting the Palestinians get away with their terrorism. So, using Bamford's thesis, perhaps it is possible to believe that Clinton's refusal to do anything about Palestinian terrorism, or about the first WTC bombing, the Khobar Towers attacks in Saudi Arabia, and the twin Embassy attacks in Africa in 1998 which in fact emboldened bin Laden to attack the mainland United States.(...)"
1,Junk,"I have not only read Bamford, I have seen him interviewed. This man is obviously campaigning for Kerry. He has taken a few grains of truth and used them to grow a crop of B.S. I can't belive he would even think of relating the problem with Palestine to, as he says, and I paraphrase, Bush's failure in the 911 event. Of course, they have had their eye on Iraq for years. Why wouldn't they? We've know for years that Iraq was a threat to all countries around them, and eventually to the world. How petty can a man be when he criticizes General Myer, President Bush, and others for being busy at their jobs, and not knowing the attack was coming? Hindsight is wonderful, when applied to the good, but when filled with hate, it is useless. This man is a loose cannon hunting for President Bush."
5,Taking Names,"This was the last book on my two week vacation reading list..wish I had read it long ago. I could have saved myself a lot of independent research time.Bamford does repeat himself somewhat but the way he covers the all the various players and events involved from 911 to Iraq and strings them together makes the book worthwhile.It is true a lot of what he covers was already out there but the details he includes makes the information all the more startling.A lot of good blow by blow reviews have already been given so I would only add my personal reaction to the book..which is that we Americans have 1,550 dead and 12,000 wounded reasons to see to it that the entire Cheney cult chickenhawks and Feith, Perle, Wolfowitz, Wurmser, the OSP boys and Israeli firsters end up hanging from some gallows on the mall or sent to prison for treason."
2,Naive,"How can an author describe all the pre-911 movements and the post-911 actions without knowing that the same people facilitated the triggering event? Without 911, what would be the reasoning to spark a war that had been meticulously planned? Bamford said he had no evidence to to support that the Bush White House knew about the attack beforehand, but where is the evidence to support (other than from the White House) that al Qaeda had the capacity to train the hijackers on Boeing aircraft, calculate the tactical plan and make billions of dollars worth of insider trades? Mr. Bamford, you're so close to unlocking the real truth--- all you have to do now is read Philip Marshall's False Flag 911: How Bush, Cheney and the Saudi Created the Post 911 World.Your investigation is incomplete."
2,Bias Reporting,"Bamford has a lot of details, but his take on them is really bias. At the same time he can idolize the heads of CIA and NSA, yet not hold them responsible for the pitiful failures of their agencies. He clearly has dislike for Bush, yet can write about the violence of the terrorist matter of fact without a hint of comment on their killing of civilians. Bamford clearly believes the terrorist were justified in their attacks of 9-11-2001."
5,Deceptions that led to the Iraq War,"This is an excellent book. A lot of people need to read this book in order to start asking the right questions about the Iraq war. Not only questions about how good the intelligence was linking Iraq to 9/11 and Al Qaeda (much of it is either fraudulent or nonexistent, according to the book) but also questions about why leaders who saw how bad the intelligence was allowed the Bush administration to continue using the intelligence with impunity."
1,Mold?,"I bought two 24 can cases of this canned dog food, but on opening a couple I fond large black lumps of less than one inch in diameter. Is this mold or some ingredient? I don't know, but it doesn't look nice. I am contacting customer service to ask about returning this VERY EXPENSIVE dog food. I expect the return process will be a pain, but my dog got sick after the first can so I won't give her any more. From now on it's HOME COOKING for my German Sheperd!"
5,"Best footwear to grace my tootsies, EVER!","Own these in 3 colors. I'm always sad when I have to put another pair on. These shoes go forever...and having a naturally high instep the elastic across the top is the best thing to keep them from pinching, even after walking around the school's concrete floors all day.You will not regret this. Buy them. Now. Women's Skechers Bikers WaterlilySkechers USA Women's Waterlily Skimmer"
5,loved it!!!,This DVD was great! I really enjoyed all the wonderful ideas in this DVD. The ideas are so creative. It has inspired me to make healthy lunches for my children this upcoming school year. Even if you walk away with only 1 or 2 tips it is worth the money. I only wish they had a DVD for healthy breakfasts. You won't be disappointed.
5,Childhood favorite found,This movie was one of my favorites as a child. Was so happy to see it offered here at Amazon. I have not seen it anywhere else. Still as fun and adventurous as I remember!
4,"exellent,100% satisfied","this movie was as good as i remembered as a 7 year old boy. I hope that my grandchildren will appreciate it as much as i did when i was 7 although it is a bit dated, it is still up there with other childhood greats as pete's dragon and mary poppins. Overall rating (great movie)pay close attention it is in heavy english.I'd like to see where young thomas ended up after this movie."
4,"This ""Classic"" Book to Movie Holds Up","I loved this story so much when I was a very young boy, that when the movie came out late-70s, I took my 4 year-old daughter to see it. She loved it, and now I've bought a copy to give to my granddaughter. Watching it again was a delight. For the down-the-chimney-and-into-the-little-girl's-room scene alone, I'd watch the film all over again. The songs are adorable, and the seahorse just may be the first animated ""gay"" character is movies. Lionel Jeffries (""The Railway Children,"" ""The Amazing Mr. Blunden"") is an actor who also managed to direct some lovely children's films that adults can enjoy equally well. Try this one and see for yourself."
3,"Love the beginning, HATE IT WHEN IT TURNS INTO A CARTOON!","The live action parts are quite amazing, it's basically Disney with balls, great characters and acting, good writing and what seems to be a very interesting story. SUDDENLY an animation pops up worse than anything Filmmations ever released! Without looking, I counted at least 4 ""dissapearing"" objects throughout (due to faulty proof work) not to mention dialogue out of synch, horrible design and many more things too numerous to mention. [...]The best thing I can say about this (what could have been) great film, is that it claims the first Homosexual Sea-horse, and openly GAY cartoon character. Hurray!"
2,This movie is like being on an acid trip.,"Out of the distant corners of my memory came a single catchy song: ""Hicocalorum"" or something like that. I remembered it was from some old movie that was part live-action and part animation. After years of searching, I've found it, and so have you.Please note- this movie is bad. Yes, I know you thought it was awesome as a kid, but kids are easily impressed, especially back in '79 when I first saw this.This movie is wacked. It's hard to understand what most people are saying since the English/Welsh accent is very strong. The plot is pretty convoluted - many things go unexplained and make very little sense. Watching the animated part is like being on some kind of acid trip, but without actually having to take any.Please note, you are better off leaving this as a childhood memory, rather than buying this DVD and totally messing with your head."
3,"Love it when it turns into a cartoon, hate the beginning!!","I remember loving this movie as a girl (age 8) so I got it for my 3 year old daughter. THe first 20 minutes are actors and actresses before it turns into a cartoon. THE MOVIE HERE IS PHYSCHO!!! It's in a dreary, dark town with gypsies, and floating heads that either just stare or wink and fill up the whole screne with errie music in the background. For a 3 year old who sees T.V. as reality and real it can be very tramatic. It's no fun having to monitor the movie that whole time fast-forwarding through the parts when an ugly, head comes on the screne while my daughters eyes get really big and clenches her fists. It must have been made in the 70's listening to the psychodelic music."
3,Don't Remember the story but the songs...,"I saw this movie when I was like eight years old and that was so long ago! I remember vaguely a dirty little boy going on a undersea adventure. And let me tell you every so often a few lines of the water baby song and that silly traveling 'hey hey we're on our way' creep into my head. It is a funny thing, the way the mind works and fills with useless information."
5,Water Babaies and the music,I really loved this movie. After all of these years the song High Clorcoroum sticks out in my head and I really hope to get a copy on DVD soon.
5,Great Fun!,"I rented ""The Water Babies"" repeatedly when I was younger, and it was always one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, when I got older and went looking for a bit of nostalgia, the film was nowhere to be found. Thankfully, I managed to locate a copy yesterday, and it's just as wonderful as I remembered. It's a wonderful fantasy film for children, with catchy songs that they'll probably be repeating for years."
5,a wonderful House-Dance Track in electronic Style!,"Wow, this one is the new CC Catch Dance hymn, after the first listening you won't forget it! Also another two wonderful house tracks ""Spring"" and ""How does it feel"" (could be a single too!!). Go for it!"
3,Lacks Instructions,"The production quality of this video is very good. However, the instructions are very poor. The steps were not clearly presented, maybe its due to the camera angels that they used.Its easier to study the various dances by watching the full video,than the instuctions presented.It's a good reference video, but not for instructions."
2,ONE FUNNY SCENE--THAT'S IT,"I am pleased that with the Broadway production of ""The Producers"", Mel Brooks is getting the recognition he deserves for his earlier works. However, this flick is mainly forgettable, along with everything else for the last twenty years.This movie is a rip-off of 1983's ""Trading Places"", just as Brooks' ""To Be Or Not To Be"" was a rip-off of its original.There is, however, one very funny scence where he gets into a slap fight. I had tears rolling down from laughing so hard.So, after 1980's ""History Of The World"", which was ok, you had ""To Be....."", the fogettable ""Spaceballs"" and this one. The spark had been gone a long time"
3,Silly Comedy,I think it might have been fun if it was a musical instead of movie. The homeless lady's face was so clean with make-up that she did not look like homeless. Not a very good movie.
1,Irrelevant and not funny,Life Stinks was the first real stinker in Mel Brooks' catalog (and unfortunately it wasn't the last.) I think Brooks had by this time exhausted all the potential for his type of humor.
4,Life Stinks - Mel Brooks,"I found this movie to be very very funny and I've seen it 3 or 4 times, laughing more and more. Ray"
5,From Rich to Homeless,"Interesting to see how MONEY could transform peoples mind, attitute and point of view about life. This is an 80's movie that you don't want to missed. An excellent movie for the entire family."
5,A Winner,Another great book by Patricia Scanlan. Set in Kilronan Ireland a small-town with so much going on and with great characters written so you feel you know them.Oliver Flynn Noreen Heather and Ruth were my standout characters. Patricia Scanlan's books are very warm and hard to put down this one is no exception. The story takes you to Dublin London and New York following the lives of each of these women. Another Patricia Scanlan great story.
3,a good read,"This book by Patricia Scnalan is not my usual fare but I can see why she has a following and a good number of books. The characters are sketched out so you think you know them and the plot is interesting. What more do you really want? I would call it a woman's book but a man can read and enjoy it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the ""Isms"" and ""Wesley's Wars"""
2,ruefully yours,"I thought the story was enjoyable enough, but I think the author overused to word 'rueful' to the point of insanity. At one point I was so sick of seeing that word on every other page and I was going to go back and count the amount of times the word appeared.I would read another one of her books, but surely there are other ajectives one could use to get the point across?"
1,"Deplorable "" Deconstuction Scholarship""","This beautiful hard bound book with the picture of Thomas Jefferson on the cover is deceiving. It contains 18 essays on Thomas Jefferson and his views on citizenship, education, slavery,and religion. Of the 18 only about 4 essays are really fair and bereft of the political correctness that has infected the American history ""profession"". Douglas L. Wilson, on Jefferson's views on Literacy, David Mayers's of Jefferson's views on constitutional change ,Suzanne Morse on the ""ward republics, and finally Liu Zuonchang's essay on the overall progrssivness of Jefferson are really the only good essays. The rest are libels on Jefferson using 20/21st century standards to judge an enlightened and progresive of the 18th/19th century. Overall, poor deconstruction scholarship."
4,"Nice, but...","I miss the devious sense of humor that was present on People, Planets and Washing Machines or Mo' Wasabi. There are many great guitar players around. There are probably even a few who can craft clever big band or electric jazz band arrangements. The thing that makes Randy special is the blend of instrumental virtuosity and humor. It's a small category which includes people like the legendary Frank Zappa. I just found Paradise Citizens used and I'm hearing it for the first time. The music has the quality I've come to expect from Randy. Unfortunately, I'm half-way through and there are no comic relief tracks like ""Mo'Wasabi"" or ""My Funny Valentine Shot the Sheriff"" here. If I got a few laughs in addition to the fine musicianship, I would bump it up to five stars. I also wish there was a seller out there offering ""People, Planets, and Washing Machines"" on CD for less than $25!"
4,enjoyable textbook,"Do you ever check a course syllabus and think, ""I have to read three chapters of the text for next class!?!"" No worries here. This textbook is not only worth reading, you'll actually look forward to each chapter. btw, if ""Getting to Yes"" isn't required, read it before your negotiations class starts. Many texts and articles published since GTY was written tip their hats before proceeding."
1,Poor Structure and Layout - A tough read,"I find this book to be poorly organized and a tough read. The content is good but the editing, layout and readability are very poor. The authors also use needless terms and vocabulary which are not commonplace to anyone who has not read the text. I suppose if you are highly academic, you might appreciate this book, but if you want a book to provide you with the ""essentials of negotiation"", as the title states, then I think this book misses the mark entirely.I suspect the book is a version of the authors' class notes. It also states the obvious - ""studies have shown that expert negotiators do better in negotiations than amateurs"" REALLY? that's amazing... If you're not reading this book for a class I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Good Book,Purchased this book as a requirement for a master's level course. I was well written and served its purpose. I still have this book as a reference in my office.
4,An Excellent Introduction,"This book lives up to its title. It does provide an excellent introduction to the essentials of negotiations. If you can afford it, I recommend that you purchase this book andMind and Heart of the Negotiator, The (4th Edition)by Leigh Thompson. However, if you have a limited budget and want to read a single book as an introduction to the topic, I recommend Leigh's book."
1,DOES NOT live up to it's name,"I purchased this to attach about 10 patches to a nylon carry bag. I searched the internet for something to attach them and found this. The glue run's all over when you apply it, takes for ever to heat it up to the point that it takes and then after it drys it cracks and comes loose. Not worth it at all. Found a much MUCH better product called RHINO GLUE. This stuff is like crazy glue times ten. but it is super fast, drys in seconds no heat needed, drys clear and it's PERMANENT !!! I even found it on EBAY for $4.95 which is $2 less then on the Rhino website. Great stuff !"
4,"Good product, but give time to set","It says to wait about 20 minutes before application, but you really need about 45 minutes before you can iron it on."
4,"Works awesome, no sewing needed!!","Let me just be clear, you have to be patient and while it may seem you are going to burn something; this glue works perfect once you get it hot enough. I used it, works awesome. The other review about needing an iron, yes you need an iron for this product but i don't see what that has to do with the product; should have researched it first ;)"
1,Stupid...stupid and more Stupidity,"This is about the most horrible movie I have ever seen in my life. I can't even beleive Noami went along with this movie after reading this script. I think whoever made this movie need to be slapped everyday for the rest of his life. I wanted to give it no star but amazon won't let me. I'm a fan of horror, or triller movie. This one is terrible. What a waste?"
2,Senseless violence,Two young thugs take a family captive and torture them physically and emotionally for their own amusement. There is nothing more to this movie than that.
2,the worst remake,"I was expecting an American remake of the original movie, with a new environment, people, and new twists. But I was totally disappointed. This is definitely the laziest remake in the history of cinema, the same script, the same camera movement and the same dialogues only with a terrible performance from Naomi Watts (as if King Kong wasn't enough). While everything worked very well for the original movie, the European set and dialogues are completely artificial and stupid for the American remake. I really would like to know what Michael Haneke was thinking. The only reason I don't give this movie one star is because of Michael Pitt's (The Dreamers and Bully) excellent performance."
2,cmon now,this movie was alright i never saw the original kinda boring but what really upset me was how much of a pus??y tim roths character was i mean cmon now CMON NOW those two little geeks with one golf club playing their funny games i would have ran through them 2 so so so quick they should have cast the 2 being at least somewhat menacing .
4,Just horrible - but it's suposed to be,"Geez. This one is tough. I donnot think that anyone with any sense of morality could say that they enjoyed this film. It is however, an extremely successful horror exercise. In short - it succeeds because it frazzles your last nerve, tests you endurance as a voyeur and leaves you feeling just horrible. Not sure though, if that's what I call entertainment. Acting and direction is great throughout."
1,Please seek help!,"If you like this movie, then you are a sociopath, whether you realize it or not. Please seek professional help.Ordinarily I don't favor censorship, but a movie such as this is itself an atrocity. A pox on everyone involved in the production and distribution of this atrocity. If you are a sane, civilized person, avoid this at all cost, and never look back."
2,Not really worth it,"After reading the reviews and the excerpt on the back of the case, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I love horror/psychological thrillers, and I have to say, this movies was neither. There were a few points during the movie where I was in suspense, but overall I just kept asking myself, WHAT IS GOING ON??? It was weird, and not weird in the good way that makes you think. Just weird and what I found to be pointless. It was slow, painfully slow at points.I did however have to watch it all the way through just to see what was going on (the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1).I wish I could get that 112 minutes of my life back. Maybe I should just rewind . . ."
2,Cheap ploy,"Funny Games, while difficult to watch, is a mostly fantastic horror film...until the remote control scene. While some reviewers consider it brilliant, I found it to ruin the movie. What was a creepy, evil film with some very realistic twists and turns, turns out to be more an excercise in the director trying to manupulate the medium. It just feel cheated frankly."
2,An utter waste of your time,"In this movie, one of the killers actually turns to the camera and talks to you. Yeah, its bad. In another scene, one of the killers doesn't like an action that just happened, so he gets the TV remote and reverses the scene so it doesn't happen. Really, really bad. No real plot development. Just a choreographed torture & killing of a family. Two stars for some tense moments. Avoid this stinker."
1,"Depressing, stupid, and a complete waste of time","2 guys show up, with seemingly no motive, and slaughter a sweet family. There's no real plot, no real story... No point. Just a violent, pointless movie about a family being killed for no reason. An enormous waste of time as well as being depressing to watch.There's also a point in the movie where one of the killers literally rewinds what happens in the movie and changes the story... I mean he literally grabs a remote, in the movie, and rewinds what happens... In the movie... What....?One of the most pointless movies ever made of violence without any message or point. A truly horrible movie."
1,not good,"I am a big fan of horror, thrillers and slashers. This did not deliver for me. It was more about artistic cinematography, long shots, sparse and contrived dialogue and an unconventional film style, not in a good way. I am a big Tim Roth and Naomi Watts fan but they don't even have roles that take advantage of their skills. I did not like the opening credits, there was not a stitch of character development (although that was part of the point of the movie), and I wish it had fewer stars so I had avoided buying it. Which is, in part, why I am writing my first review, to help others avoid this. Best watched if borrowed from someone who already purchased it."
1,SHOULD GET NO STARS!!,"I don't know how a movie about two preppie psycopaths could be boring, but this movie manages just that. I ended up fast forwarding through most of it, just hoping that it would get more interesting. Instead, it just seems to get more and more unbelievable and uninteresting. I was hoping that at least the ending would give me something to gnaw on, but no luck there. I won't bore you with the details, but I surely am glad that I rented this DVD instead of buying it. I only wasted $5, thank goodness!"
2,"Could've done it, really could have.","It's not that this movie was terrible. It truly wasn't. The acting was good, the premise was awesome, but then it happened. I was enjoying it quite a lot until they got to the ""remote control"" part. That ruined it for me. It was like the most unfair move in ANY movie I have EVER seen. I didn't see the original Funny Games, so I didn't expect this to happen. There are movies where you root for the ""good people"" and even if they don't make it in the end, at least they had fair game to survive. This was a complete slap in the face, and even if that was the writer's intention, he basically turned a decent movie into an implausible crapfest. At that moment the film lost all believability. To everyone who gave this high ratings, were we watching the same movie?"
2,Uncomfortable Movie,"I need to preface by saying that my taste in movies has changed. I used to love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hostel type flicks, but I don't so much enjoy the torture types that are all too possible. As long as there is a layer of fictionalized separation, I can enjoy. In this case, the movie provides an all too possible eventuality of a normal family being tormented by a pair of social deviants. So the basic story made me uncomfortable. That said, I do believe that the movie is well done; good acting, very well done camera work and sets. High production values. If you're a fan of this type of flick, its for you."
1,One of Worst of All Time!,"This is simply one of the dumbest movies ever made. It is not scary or funny, clever or entertaining. I saw it on HBO on demand and fast forwarded through 80% of it just because I wanted to see how this abomination of a film ended. The directors and producers should be forced to live through the plot in real life as punishment or, worse yet, they should be tied down and forced to watch the movie in an endless loop. If there is someone in your life that you really, really, really don't like - buy them this movie."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This movie was horrible! The begining of the movie was really bad because the camera work was all over the place and the sound was off. Ms. Watts is a good actress, but even she couldn't save this movie."
4,Dont listen,I dont know why so many people gave such a bad review.. I love this movie. The remake is better then the org but the org is still good.. Dont listen to these idiots. The remake of Funny Games is great! I think alot of people dont like it because of the fact the bad guys win but its nice for a change.
2,SAME OLD STUFF IN A NEW BOX!,"'Funny Games' is one of those films that deserves some credit for trying to be different, but fails to do what it sets out to do. The good cast can only make this long and boring film tolerable. When you strip this film down, your stuck with nothing more than a pair of old shoes in a new box! This is more irritating than disturbing."
4,Dare I Say Better Than the Original?,"I hate it when people ask me to recommend a scary movie, because most ""horror"" movies don't scare me. This one did. They don't rush into the house; everything is calm and orderly. That is true horror. I saw the German version of this movie with my film group, and this is shot for shot the same, but with Tim Roth being the awesome actor he is. This is definitely one of my favorite films. This isn't your typical horror movie, so you can't watch it thinking it will be. It's smart and subtle, so prepare yourself for long shots and get yourself in the mindset of a student learning a lesson, and not just a spectator."
2,funny games,"This film was kinda interesting. Its just that toward the end/ending, I felt like I was left hanging. Meaning that the ending could have had a better ending. I was surely hoping that this two guys would have got caught, and tortured for the crime they committed, but instead the film leads one to think that they're going to repeat the same crime all over again, but with a different family. So therefore, I would have to say that this movie sucks!!!!"
1,What NOT TO DO if your home invaded,"They will have to kill me before I just sit there and watch my family be tortured and killed right in front of me. Even if they kill me I guarantee you one or both of them are coming with me.This movie is a good example of what NOT TO DO in a home invasion.- THINGS THE FAMILY SHOULD HAVE DONE --Never trust ANY stranger know matter who the hell they are.-Never let Any stranger or anyone in your house without being very sure of how to handle things if they go wrong.-Train and drill your family in advance to be ready if things go really sour.These three tips are just a few of the things this family SHOULD have done before and during the fact.I know it's only a movie but these kind of things really happen all the time all around the world.So stay sharp and aware my friends,GOD Bless :)"
1,Let Down,"The only thing good about this movie was Michael Pitt's performance. The movie was not enjoyable, and the ending was unsatisfying and disturbing. If I want true to life disturbing situations, I'll watch the news."
1,horrible!!!!,"Me and my husband watched this movie together and it was so horrible!! The pace of the movie is slow and the storyline is unbelievable.I would have took a pan and beat the crap out of those guys! At the beginning they had no weapons but a golf club????? Yeah very believable that someone can take 2 grown adults hostage with a freaking golf club??? The husband wasn't even trying to get tough with these guys!!! He didnt even try,What a wimp.Don't waste your time watching this movie."
4,Quite possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen,"The reason that there are so many one and two star reviews for this movie is because it is everyones worst nightmare, 2 morally deranged & insane people terrorizing a family for absolutely no reason. There were no monsters, there were no zombies, there were no demons to make you say ""oh, it's just fantasy"". This is something that could happened, and has happened, across the world. This is your worst nightmare...being defenseless, not being able to protect your family. There were so many long, drawn out, truly tense moments that I found myself gripping the arm rest of my couch.Don't go in expecting this to be Die Hard. This is very, very, very brutally real."
2,Not Set In Reality,"So, two psychos enter your home and wont leave. They then proceed to injure you (but not too badly), and kill your dog. Instead of fighting back, you allow them to take charge, even though they are barely past puberty and have no gun?Funny Games carries with it one of the worst cases of ""there is no way I would act like that in the same situation"" that I have seen on film. While the acting is very good, and the cinematography and score was above par, the movie was just not believable.If you can suspend belief, and pretend that you wouldn't fight back, then you will like this film."
3,Hold onto your eggs!,"Ostensibly this is the theme of Funny Games: to question our desire to witness exploitative violence on screen. If so the movie succeeds, but only partially. Haneke attempts to make us complicit in the violence; to accuse us of a bloodlust by proxy, but by producing a very slick film that bludgeons us with the very thing we're supposed to feel guilty about it's difficult to avoid the suspicion that Haneke himself is keen to fuel this lust. That's not to say there's anything wrong with such an agenda. It's not a comfortable place to visit, our darker side, but movies offer one method of safely exorcising some of our crueler impulses. Ultimately, despite the tricksiness and clever manipulation, Funny Games feels just a tad disingenuous ... or maybe it's simply mischievous."
2,Eh not as good as you would think,Ok so I was excited to see this movie.. I thought wow a good actress is in it.. That's a bad sign.. I find sometimes horror movies with unknown actors are better..So the beginning is good. The blonde leader kid is good. Creepy. BUT then it starts getting DUMB. So the whole egg scene is bizzare. I dont wanna give away too much but she's just stupid the second time she puts up with it..and WHY on earth didn't she tell her friends!!!!!!! CMON!Then I also thought she has knives in the kitchen she couldve grabbed one quick and sliced the guys! BUT NOOOOOOOO............Overall.. I was dissapointed. The ending was UGH.. I spent 5 bucks renting this and I wish I had waiting for it to be on HBO. You should all just wait. see no evil is a better flick!
1,Ridiculous,"A well made, well acted and superbly directed horror movie with wall to wall tension and absolutely nothing to show for any of it. This film is an appalling waste of talent, time and money. The final blow was some ""breaking the fourth wall"" cop-out instead of a much needed ending. Inexcusable rubbish."
1,A movie for sickos only.,"""An intelligent, thought provoking movie"". Unbelievable. Someone actually said that about this movie.Zero stars, actually. What sort of people get their jollies watching this kind of gratuitous violent garbage? Don't know? OK, let me tell you: people who are already deeply disturbed and may be a danger to themselves and those around them. I understand why the film was made: to cater to those on the fringe of society who enjoy watching other people suffer. And, of course, to make money. No, it's not ""only a movie"". It's a movie for bullies and animal torturers.Anyone who truly enjoys this movie is an automatic psychiatric 911 call. Get help. Before it's too late. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for those around you. The basic question is what have we come to as a society, that some (hopefully, very few) would consider this actual entertainment? A dirt sandwich is better than ""Funny Games""."
1,Avoid this One!!!,This is a real dumb movie--full of blood and guts with no explanation or reason. What a waste of the acting talents of Watts and Tim Roth. The plot is never really developed--just two guys playing games with murder and getting off on it. I have seen many other horror movies with more plot and reason than this. The ending does not do much and is pretty stupid. Rent it and be disappointed--do not buy!!!!!!
2,Okay,"this remake to the 1998 version of funny games is okay. it's pretty much the sam thing. actually it is the same movie but with diffrent actors. the only thing diffrent in the movie is the dogs name. but every detaile and line is the same. that is probably the only thing i liked about the movie, plus naomi watts is hot. but all in all i didn't klike the movie seen too many of it's kind. and it wasn't really scary the only scary thing is that the boys did it for fun and nothing else. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't"
1,Somebody owes me an hour and a half!,"About 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Not much I can say about how ridiculous this movie is that has not already been written. Two guys come into your home with no weapons and are able to hold you and your family captive and torture them while you do nothing??? I am not usually angered by the time I wasted watching a movie, after all, no one put a gun to my head to make me watch it, but after this one, I really felt I was robbed of precious time in my life. Even renting this movie is a waste of $2.50 that I wish I had spent on something more entertaining, like laundry detergent. What a waste!"
1,negative stars were not avaliable.......,"Words cannot describe how horrible this movie was. I mean my god it was down right awful it sucked and it was the worst of all times, with no plot and the villians acting like they are talking to you. SUCKED !!! Do not waste your time........!!!"
1,Anti-cinema,This pitiful remake makes for pointelss cinema - I honestly would rather have a second helping of Marco Ferreri's 'La Grande Bouffe.' Not the most ringing endorsement.
1,Cheap Horror Porn for the Mentally Disturbed,Don't waste your time on this trash. It's just a snuff film. There is no art in the directing when the content is just meaningless murder and violence.
2,"Textbook example of ""Artsy Fartsy""","This film is a textbook example of ""artsy fartsy""........that odd term that describes when a creative person tries to make something odd or controversial just for the sake of being odd or controversial.Some will try to read some deeper social meaning or commentary into this film.But they are simply ""cloud watching""........ meaning that when we stare at a shapeless cloud long enough our conditioned mind attempts to create a recognizable shape out of it.It is the same with this film.... although it is really just odd nonsense to throw off the audience, many will try to find some deep meaning in this film.I think the writer/director is having fun pulling the leg of his audience.How did they get Naomi Watts to do this film ?Now THAT is a real mystery !!!"
2,Falls Short Of Expectations,"I don't have a whole lot to say about this novel. It was a dry and mostly uninteresting read at best. Justinian is an unlikable and almost flat protagonist. If you are looking for historical information, or if you just want to read about Sklavinian serving women pulling off their tunics, then this might be a book for you. If you are looking for literary skill or an absorbing read, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Not a very appealing character or story.,"Setting aside the fact that Justinian was not a good person to begin with, this story makes it impossible to root for him EVER -- in fact, I spent most of the book wishing he'd be done away with sooner! Another disappointing and distracting plot device was the asides by Myakes -- to have a character supposedly ""discuss"" Justinian's autobiography wouldn't be bad if the other character to whom he's supposedly speaking is actually represented in writing. It's a device that simply doesn't play well -- this is a novel, not a play where characters are allowed to have asides to move the plot along. Perhaps the author didn't feel up to writing about the character of Brother Elpidios -- which is probably a shame since none of the other characters were even remotely likeable.Overall, this book was disappointing. It lacked any sort of creative spark whatsoever -- if you have an interest in Justinian, buy a historical work."
2,Too boring to finish,"I love *good* historical fiction - I've reread Patrick O'Brian's Maturin/Aubrey series many a time. But this story just didn't hold my interest. I particularly disliked the format in which it was told, in which someone ""off screen"" occasionally interrupts the book.I've read some of Turtledove's other alternate history stuff, and I think he simply isn't that good at creating interesting characters. Instead, as we read the alternate history, we're interested by comparing/contrasting his world to ours.In the end, I stopped reading the book about half way through because I simply didn't care about the story or the characters."
3,needs att'ion,THE FRONT LOADER does not tilt back enough to hold a lot of sand and the back loader is hard to unlock and swing around
5,KIDS LOVE THIS BACKHOE SO MUCH THEY FIGHT OVER TIME TO USE IN NEIGHBORHOOD,WE BOUGHT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS FOR OUR 3 YEAR OLD. HE USES IT EVERY TIME HE IS OUTSIDE AND THE KIDS FROM AGE 3 TO 10 IN NEIGHBORHOOD FIGHT OVER TIME TO GET ON IT I HAVE TO TIME THEM. VERY DURABLE EVEN HOLDS A 10 YEAR OLD. GREAT EXERSIZE INSTEAD OF BATTERY OPERATED ONE. MUST BUY!
4,assembly is interesting,"This product was delivered with a broken front bucket with prompt response provided by the vendor. The assembly was compounded due to the fact that the directions were quite poor. Anyone that is mechanically challenged could find this a bit frustrating. This comment is similar to others that have shared their thoughts. Once assembled, the finished product is very nice and seems to be able to withstand just about anything our oldest grandson can dish out. Good luck with the assembly"
4,learn german!,"Product is great. right size for ages listed. strong, quality manufacturing for kids toy and wheels have added treads in middle for pedaling traction. Only downside was all the instructions were in German!! Fortunately, lots of pictures were included but this made assembly time longer!"
2,cat front loader,"It takes a good 4 hours to put together, no joke! There are so many pieces. Give yourself time and get help to put it together. Ours came damaged, what a disappointment, we had to give it to our son broken, amazon replaced it and said return the unused parts, what a project that was! It took forever on the phone with people from india who you can't understand!Think twice!"
4,Birthday Present for 3 year old,"We bought this for our 3 year old Grandson. He loves it. My husband put it together and he loves putting things together and is really good at it. He had to admit, it wasn't hard, but took time. IF you have never put anything together have someone else do it. Well worth the price. After buying items before that we knew would last one day. This looks like it will last for sometime. My Grandson would not get off of it the first day. lol. He had a smile on his face all day. adjustable seat is also nice. Everything was in the package. YOU DO NEED TO READ the directions, as my husband took one thing a part and had to redo due to him only looking at pictures. lol. Would buy again."
5,Best construction toy out there,"My grandson has had this for almost a year now. He got it from Santa in 2008 and he plays with it everyday. Always heading to a new construction site. Grandpa put it together with little difficulties. Time consuming, that's all. My grandson could operate the backhoe the first time he sat on it. It must be in his blood. Expensive, that's for sure, but if you have a Bob the BUilder at your house, he NEEDS this toy."
2,bad tires,"Outdoor toy that won't move outdoors! It's too big for the house, but the tires won't grab traction outside. Only one tire spins when pedalling. My 3 yr old loves to play with it but has to get off and push it to make it move outside. I wish someone would put real tires on these toys so the kids could actually use them outdoors and not just on driveways and sidewalks. It's a dirt toy! I would not purchase this again or recommend it unless they will be riding it on cemented surfaces."
4,If you survive assembly...,"watching your child lose their mind playing with it will be worth it.The directions are marginal at best and would benefit greatly from some written directions and labeling the bags and parts. I am very experienced at building RC cars and helicopters and I had to keep referring to the drawings to make sure I wasn't doing it wrong.The rear stabilizer (under the excavator seat) could be sturdier and easier to deploy, but neither seem to be a problem for our son who is going on three. It would be nice if the locks for the front end loader portion could be engaged with one hand, but it doesn't seem to take away from his enjoyment.I do recommend this product, just make sure you have enough room to store it and patience to assemble it. (hint: some of the stickers are large and very thin in order to make the curves, spray a little mild detergent diluted with water to make positioning them easier)"
3,Not a bad product,"I think the concept of this toy of awsome. However, we got it for my son's 3rd birthday and we realize this toy is a little too much for him at this age. The toy makes really wide turns making it difficult for him to ride it even in the driveway. The front loader is too heavy for him to use while sitting on the seat. The back hoe has too many steps to be ale to set up and use (unlock this while pulling up on that, then turn this and unlock another part, etc...). He really does enjoy using the back hoe in the dirt afer you get it set up. Maybe he will enjoy it more when as he gets older."
5,I just love it Mommy...it is just SO cool (((big smiles))),"We bought this for my son's 4th birthday. It was a HUGE hit! For sizing...he is BIG for his age weighing about 45lbs and 43"" tall. It fits him perfectly and should for awhile. My husband is very handy and had no trouble putting it together...it took him about an hour. If you are buying one for a gift, be sure you have enough time to assemble...as others have said it took them longer. Once assembled, I questioned whether it would be large enough for my son, however it was fine. If it was any larger it would be very difficult for a child to manage. The quality seems durable, but today was only day one. Overall, it was a great gift for my little guy. He LOVES all things construction and farm equipment. My title says it all...that was as I was putting him to bed...an exact quote. I hope this helps:)"
4,Worth the effort to put together,"As stated in the other reviews, the assembly directions are very poor. However, just go to www.kettler.com and watch the tutorial on how to assemble the tractor/loader/backhoe and how to use it. This toy is sturdy plastic, better than sharp, hard metal that can get too hot in the sun or can have cutting edges. It works realistically and will make any little tractor lover crazily happy. We were also missing parts, the two front wheel covers. The company quickly replaced them and our little guy was ready to roll. Well worth the cost, check ebay over amazon for price comparison, just look for companies with 99-100% ratings, don't buy from low rated sellers, you could regret it."
4,Great toy but instructions are difficult,"I got this for my 3.5 year old son for Christmas. Great toy, durable and worth the money.The instructions are all in German so you have to use the illustrated pictures. I actually found this site http://www.kettlerusa.com/813001.html which is a little animated toy that you click on and it shows you how to operate and how to assemble. I had to refer to it to figure out how the backhoe works.All in all, a wonderful toy!!!"
3,Kettler Bulldozer,"Terriable, poor instructions for such a pricey item!!! VERY VERY time consuming to put together! It took 3 able adults over two hours to assemble. There was 3 bags of parts with 3 very very poor picture instructions. All ""visual"" instructions which they colored parts that were not the actual color. Overall it is a cool toy but our son gets frustrated that the excavator has to be removed in order to ride it. He also prefered his tool bench Santa brought instead! Should have ""listened"" to the other reviews which complained about similiar problems. Knowing what we know now, we would not have purchased this item."
3,missing part,"When the item arrived it was missing a part. After receiving the replacement backhoe from amazon it has worked fine for my children. Be warned the assembly time is quite long. Still waiting on amazon to respond to emails in regards to returning the one with missing part, it has been almost a month and there is still no instructions on the return link, just says you will get an email which we have not and they will not respond to emails."
2,Could be built better for the price.,"We got this for our boys' birthday and thought they would be really excited. They were, but they would like it a whole lot more if it was built a bit sturdier. The whole thing is plastic, so we aren't suspecting it will last too long with 3 boys using it. They do like and want to take it everywhere, but the tires have little to no traction, so unless the dirt is extremely hard packed with no bumps or you are on pavement, good luck using the pedals. They do like to park it and use the digger, but to actually scoop up gravel or dirt with the front scoop is not easy for a little one, so they get a bit frustrated. It's a great idea, but too costly for how it's made."
4,Shame on the publisher,I must chime in along with others who have noted that the number of typographical and grammatical errors in this book is simply shameful. I counted five errors on just two pages. This really distracted from what should have been a delightful read. Editors: step up!
2,No way to read No Angel,"I went to my local bookseller and this was a highly rated series. I hesitated to buy it as the print is so small. I have a hard time reading, and need my kindle so I can make the font as big as it gets. I am so disappointed that this series does not come on the Kindle. I loved the beginning of the book, but it is too hard for me tho read the whole thing. Perhaps publishers will learn that the visually handicapped enjoy reading too."
4,A good read spoiled,"Like the other reviewers, I really liked this book - it is an accurate description of the period, and has a number of stories within the story to hold the reader's interest. However, I also found it a difficult read because of all of the spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Any author deserves better than this, and it is a shame when a really good book is spoiled by sloppy editing and proof reading - a problem that seems to have become more and more prevalent lately."
4,Good Old-Fashioned Novel,"If you are looking to dive into a big family drama, with charcters you can relate to, love and hate, then this is the book for you. No hard reading here, just a good old fashioned read. My only problem with this book was all the typo's. But the characters were great and the story lines entertaining...like a big english soap opera. So...Enjoy!Debbi"
5,Happy to have found Penny Vincenzi!,What a great book! This book kept me going for days! The characters are so well developed! I felt like I knew them all! And it'a a trilogy! So the plot and the characters continue. I stayed up long into the night reading! Well worth your time!
4,Tastefully Scandalous,"This novel had just enough scandal to entertain but was also very classy. Normally, a novel with too many characters to keep track of throws me off, but this one introduces each character bit by bit and I had no trouble at all keeping track of who was who and what was going on in their lives. Very skillfully done. The novel spans about 15 to 20 years of the Lyttons' lives. The focus, mainly centers on the marriage of Cylia and Oliver and the troubles they face; deceit, growing apart, affairs, and secrets. About half the book gives you tremendous insight into world war one and the changes it wrought for the men that fought in it and the women that struggled to keep day to day life going while the men were gone. I plan on reading the next one."
4,Rich in detail against a backdrop of the publishing industry around Ww2.,"As usual, Pennny does an amazing job creating her characters and skillfully interweaves their lives in the ww2 era. There are many twists and turns in the plot, you can't put it down. Looking forward to the next in the series."
5,Couldn't put this one down...,"After reading Sheer Abandon as my first introduction to Vincenzi, I must say this book is miles above. But, now I am hooked! It is impossible to put this book down. It is full of drama, romance and a clever storyline which keeps you hooked and wanting to find out what happens next. This is the first in a trilogy, 2 further books in this series continue the story. The 3 books follow the lives of a family over 40 years and cover both world wars so there are interesting facts thrown in along the way, although this is hardly a historical work. What was interesting to me was seeing the first World War from a woman's perspective.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to get involved in a book and lose themselves for a while. I am going to lend this to my friends and recommend this for reading at book club. And I am now going to start on the second book in this series."
5,Great family saga,"This work is an excellent example of a family saga. I am looking forward to reading the next two in the series, which has all the appeal of such series as the Morland novels of Cynthhia Harrod-Eagles, also purchased through AMazon,."
5,No Angel,Total entertainment and wonderfully written. This is a book to share with friends and of course I read the next two books and enjoyed just as much. These books are not to be missed if you like to read about families and the many joys and disappointments that come with living a full life.
3,Pretty to look at but not very absorbent,"I really enjoy the color of these towels! Unfortunately, I was expecting the quality of the material to be more absorbent. These towels are NOT the tea towels my parents/grand parents had. They are not the thick or heavily woven cotton kind. It may be ""My Bad"" for assuming that the flour-sack towels were on the same level as tea towels."
2,small!,"The size was not as advertised, much smaller. The quality of the fabric has changed, not the softness of the old floursack towels...disappointing. Love the colors still."
1,STAY AWAY,"Backyard wrestling is the most stupid, most boring thing i have ever seen. IF YOU like seeing people attempting sucide then you have one sick mind. It's people like you who think Excutions should be shown on TV. The People in these tapes know no real moves, All they do is bash lightbulbs, baseball bats and TV on other peoples heads. IF you are a real fan of wrestling, go buy a video from the WF. Those people use real moves with real skils. Fans stay away from this stuff."
1,these PEOPLE are CRAZY,personally i love hardcore the ecw the wwf with mankind flying of the top of a cell or jeff hardy flying of a twenty foot ladder into a table and bodies but this is just nuts these kids are suicidal psychos who need help because they are supposedly trying to be famous. bull---- these people should be locked away in straight jackets and never let back in society. STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THESE THINGS
3,"Might have been the bible once, but is outdated now","First, allow me to emphasize the seminal place in law enforcement literature that this book deserves. It truly was a landmark book, and in many respects deserves to be read today. Many aspects of law enforcment, such as investigative strategies and mindsets, remain unchanged. So do basics like search patterns, the role of the investigator's notebook, and interviewing strategies.However...The book loses focus once it gives advice on the use of 35mm cameras and typewriters. Here it is hopelessly outdated. While the cop doesn't change, the tools at his/her disposal certainly do. I had hoped that this book would have kept pace, but sadly it did not. I think there are other more current books on basic investigative techniques available that unfortunately put this book back up on the hallowed shelves and out of the everyday toolbox. Sorry.. I had such high hopes for this, but in the end I ended up selling it back."
2,Learn why some police hate homosexuals and others.,"In the chapter on sex crimes in this book, the O'Haras explain how homosexuals need to be closely watched and how they have a predisposition toward negative and criminal acts. Much of this is very stereotyped.Didn't this type of thinking go out with the last Edsel to be produced? NO, I am not glorifying alternative lifestyles, but the O'Haras seem to be wanting more attention paid to them by law enforcement than is realistic.If we followed the anti-gay fervor of this book, then we would be dedicating more police hours to the ""homosexual problem"" than is economically feasible.If the O'Haras had fixated upon stereotypes of Roman Catholics or African-Americans instead of gays, this book would disappear off the shelves forever.Such material does not belong in a good police investigations manual today. Child sex abuse, crack dealing, murder, and arson belong there, but too much time is spent on social problems and lifestyles."
4,Very cute pup!,"Shipping was a little slower than we had hoped it would be- took 7 days, but the product is so cute! Our kids love their Cocker Spaniels!"
4,Adorable!!,"I love any kind of interactive toys for kids, even my daugther that's10TH years old love it!"
1,ZERO customer service from webkinz,"During all the excitement of opening holiday presents, my son's ""secret code"" was lost. Webkinz customer service attitude was terrible. Basically, they could care less - but welcome you to buy a new one. Even with proof of purchase - NOTHING. They didn't even have the courtesy to reply to my email. My son thinks its great, but I have a horrible taste in my mouth and WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER WEBKINZ."
4,I REALLY want this!,"I really want this, but every store said their sold out! It's so cute! Does anyone know were you can get Webkinz? Please, if you know tell me. I have 3 Webkinz already, but this one is so cute! And about the website, it's sooooo fun and has TONS of stuff to do! You can build a house for your pet, play fun games, make friends, get a job, buy things for your pet, earn Kinzcash (money), read books and MUCH more! Trust me, webkinz are must-buys! Buy one today! I hope this helps you."
4,Cocker Spaniel by Webkinz,"The product was delivered quickly and was ""new"" as described. The only reason I didn't rate it with a 5 was because the dog in the picture appeared to be a much darker color than what it actually was and my daughter was a little disappointed."
4,"Typical Webkinz, and that's just fine","My daughter wanted this particular Webkinz because she had heard it would be retired soon. Whether or not that's true, it's a nice addition to her collection and she always enjoys the process of ""adopting"" them and playing the games on the Webkinz site."
5,webkinz bday party favors,"I bought this Webkinz in a quantity of 20 dogs to use as Birthday Party favors for 2 yr. old's ""Puppy"" themed party. The kids loved it and I got a GREAT price!"
4,Medical Marriages - Almost right on the money!,"As a physician's spouse, I found this book very timely even though it was written more than 10 years ago. Every physician and their spouse should read this book, especially those in the 38-45 year old age group. The authors describe what drives a physician, what happens when reality does not meet their expecations, and how it impacts their spouse, children and their personal lives. I hope Dr. Menninger releases a new edition of this book soon!"
2,Not for all walls,"Super Hook No Tools Needed! Holds up to 80 lbs.!Although my cousin has been singing the praises of this item since she had her son hang some mirrors, photos and other things for her; they do not work if you live in a house that has old walls. You need to have dry walls. The old walls are too hard for the hooks to penetrate. We have one room in the house where the walls are new and can be used. Too bad. I was looking forward to the ease of them. My cousins' son said don't buy anything else and he intends to throw out any of the old hangers that he has. Both my cousin and her son have fairly new homes with new walls. They give a 5 star rating, of course.Waiting to move to as home with new walls!"
4,Works great,"I've never used the hercules hooks but I imagine these are pretty much the same thing. Don't let it fool you though, the hole is still pretty substantal, about the same as a small nail or screw, but I think these are more secure and less likely to tear up your wall. Make sure you know exactly where you are hanging items before you go stabbing them through the wall though. They have held up some picture frames and a mirror just fine. They are also holding up some movie posters I have. Be careful and make sure they are twisted around 100% and tightly hugging the wall on the inside...one of the hooks holding my movie posters swung back around and dropped the frame, so just a heads up."
1,Cheap Imitation,"Cheap imitation of the brand ones. They dont ""lock"" into the wall like the Monkey ones and just sort of flop around. I don't feel comfortable risking my pictures to these. Kinda surprising since both are just bent pieces of metal, but these don't have the same bends that create the secure ""locking""."
3,"Good price, questionable stability","I've used a competitor's patented product for about 8 years. When I misplaced my contact information for that supplier, I researched and ordered on Amazon.The price and apparent quality of these hangers are good. However, there seems to be a problem in either the angle or length of the piece that goes inside the wall, as one of the two hooks I used would not stay in the proper orientation; it would continually rotate around and become upside-down. Since this would have had the effect of dumping the item I was hanging onto the floor, I found I couldn't trust them.My results might not be typical. It could have been related to the stud configuration in that wall section. Further, it is possible I could have had success if I had adjusted the arc of the wire inside the wall."
3,Just OK,"I've had trouble inserting them deep enough into the wall, in areas where thing nails slide right in. So, I haven't been able to test the maximum weight these hooks will hold. Admittedly, my problems are likely due to user error!"
1,Not good...,"I tried using these, but they stick out from the wall. I had to bend a couple to get them more flush. I wouldn't purchase these again."
3,Strong but too long,The hooks are very strong but I had to snip off a little of the hook as it hit the insulation behind the dry wall and would not push all the way in in order to straighten
4,good hooks,These hooks arrived quickly. It solved my problem of hanging a heaving picture frame and not making a giant hole in the wall (since I rent an apartment and I have to get permission to make big holes in the walls).
1,hooks were awful!,"The hooks were awful! They kept turn around once you punctured them into the dry wall. They were loose so, they couldn't hold anything."
4,Great product!,"I ordered this item to replace one my daughter had broken from our local library. The price was awesome as well as the delivery. Also this movie and box was in better condition and played much better than the one from the library. (I almost wanted to keep it, lol) Thanks Amazon. You rock!!!"
4,Exactly What I Needed,I wanted to hang my kayak and needed something strong enough to hold over 40lbs. These are rated to hold items/people much heavier but have been working out perfectly.
4,Setup was so easy.,"Take this product out of the box, plug it into the controller slot, spread it on the floor, and put the game cartridge in, then its time to play. This is a great game for kids on those days when they cannot play outside. Gives them fun controlled physical activities. My grandkids ages 8-6, girl and boy just loved it. The game still incorporates the learning aspect incredibly well."
3,"Great idea, but poorly done","We got this for our son's 4th B-Day. He enjoyed his other V.Smile games, even though he would get fustrated with the regular controller not responding sometimes. We wanted to give the pad a try. It was very difficult for the pad to know what he was stepping on. I think V.Smile could really have a awesome product if they could match their controllers to that of PS2 or XBox. We were very disappointed with this pad along with the hand contoller. The Leapfrog game system is much better, and matches the more popular gameing systems."
5,Beautiful pillows!!!,These pillows are fabulous! They are beautiful and work so well for us on our sailboat.
2,Be Careful..This is an OLD Set,"I was very disappointed to find that these CDs cover primarily foreign SUV models older than 1995 or 1996.Suzuki and Mazda ae covered from 1998 back, but I was interested in the Isuzu/Subaru line for at least the 1998 model year.I saw an issue of Haynes that covered all SUVs from 1998 back at a [local store]. I am sorry I did not purchase it because I have been unable to locate it in the East or online in any store."
5,Basic Training Review,"Has Ann Dusenberry ever looked better? Not to my knowledge. Her 'shucks I'm from Ohio' cornpone innocence makes all the raunchiness of a fantasy Pentagon in DC seem almost real. Pre-blonde Rhonda Shear is lookin good too, and you might remember Angela Aames as the hot blonde at the bar in the pilot episode + one (the first real episode) of ""Cheers"". Dusenberry has at least three really nice scenes: a garden party where she is lovely in an off shoulder dress; making an obscene phone call to her commander; and titillating the Soviet ambassador with a very slow striptease. No belly laughs but plenty of grins and smiles if you don't take it seriously. This movie does not have a cheap look and production values are high. If you haven't seen it in awhile, dig it out and watch it again. There's no real anti-military theme here, either. It's all in fun."
4,"Good product, as described, but small figures","This chess board delivers exactly what it promises. A small and light travel chess set. The figures do stay in place when you put on the cover, so you can resume your game later. Beware only that the figures are really very small. Identifying pond and bishop or differentiating king from queen requires a juvenile eye! (We eventually put a colored ink dot on the top of the bishops)."
2,It's 'okay',"Not the best effort from Bel Canto. I really enjoyed 'White-Out Conditions', but this was a bit too dance/techno for me. 'Unicorn' is goofy as hell, probably only suitable for soppy-headed eight year old girls. 'Shimmering Warm & Bright' is a nice one; very pretty and a good use of layered vocals. 'Spiderdust' was okay as well.If you're going to check out Bel Canto, I'd suggest their first album."
4,Etherial with a great beat!,"Tromso Norway must be an interesting place. Listening to SW&B filled my head with visions of Artic winds, cold water, and setting suns, but without the drowsiness of an Enya CD. Loved it!"
4,Really Really Good!!!,Not as good as Birds of Passage (which is unforgiveably out of print) but definitely up there. And definitely worlds better than their third album. Worth getting!
5,Album Ethereal Fans Should Own!,"This is THE album I would take on a desert island if given the choice. Fans of Cocteau Twins can appreciate the dark sentiments of the vocals and fans of October Project can appreciate the steadiness of the mood-provoking background music. Everyone, perhaps, can enjoy the sensual, playful, and colorful imagery throughout the album - one of Canto's BEST!"
2,unimpressive vocal,"overall the album is quite common & i see no pt why it's rated so highly,i prefer ""love spiral downwards"" & ""area"" far better."
4,Like a trip around the world. . .,". . .Shimmering, Warm and Bright feels like a balloon ride over foreign lands, conjuring up images of exotic places and fairy-tale kindoms. The music is reminscant of the now defunct Cocteau Twins but reflects more of a world-beat feel.The first song, Unicorn, a personal favorite, a beautiful yet haunting tune. It (perfectly) sets the stage for the rest of the album, which carefully stirs emotions and the soul.Definatley a must for Twins fans, relaxing roadtrips, and for those of us who like passionate music during sex."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this DVD would uncover and disclose an intimate connection between Thoth and the Celtic cross (Not!!)to the contrary it does no such thing. It seems to focus on the most annoying background music for all time. Maybe Gardner was just using this to promote his book, but this wasn't good. Next time a little more archeaological proofs and a lot less of that inferno music!!"
2,Poor choice for an excerpt,"I love the Pippi Longstocking books-- love, love, love. Kids and adults both can enjoy them. I ordered this book hoping for something I hadn't read before, and discovered that it's just an excerpt from the first Pippi Longstocking book.The complete episode in the original book includes a battle of wits between Pippi and a cruel administrator. This excerpt only includes Pippi driving the poor teacher to distraction, and seems like an endorsement of teacher abuse, rather than the triumph of Pippi's generous spirit over a nasty, narrow-minded system. I'll have to throw it away-- I would never give it to any of the kids I know. I guess I'll have to just get them the whole original."
1,misprint!!!,"this book starts off on page 17... ???? obviously a misprint or printer error, should never have been advertised. i was going to leave seller feedback, but when i saw that it came from amazon.com, i was surprised! you need to check out your sellers better...what a waste of 5 dollars!!!!!!!!"
3,Pippi Cartoon,My daughter likes the Pippi movie with the genuine girl a bit better than the cartoon version.
1,Porsche (2 cassettes),"This is another amateur video sold as a documentary. It would fit in nicely with the scale model airplane show on public access cable. To be fair, if you really love going to vintage car shows and enjoy watching video of cars running on the track, this is the tape for you. Commentary is sparse and not too informative for the average Porsche fanatic. This would make a nice rental."
5,"Kolb provides an interesting, and eclectic,look at cosmology","Many students of astronomy/cosmology/astrophysics are rarely shown the interesting, chaotic blind luck experiments that have come before them. This book is an incredibly well-written, humorous recounting of the great minds that have shaped, essentially, our universe, through hard work and experimental luck. From the loquacious ""astronomer-king"" Brahe, to such equally profound minds as Einstein and Edwin Hubble, the stories of experiments and old-fashioned, ""mind work"" provide all an opportunity to look at these great men in an entirely different ( and sometimes, unflattering) light. And for those already experienced in the heavy physics and mathematics used to derive cosmological equations, this book provides the humanistic side to the ""bland scientist"" critique leveled at these founding fathers.All told, this is a wonderful book that will delight readers at all levels of astr/physics proficiency"
4,I knew the medium,"I had some experience of attending his trance sessions. Though not mentioned in the book, the most interesting was Sam Clemens."
5,THE ESSENCE,"Everything one could love about JAZZ is here.The good stuff. It is here. JAZZ.JAZZ is the best and this is real JAZZ.I love JAZZ music. I love it every day of my life and thisrecord makes me very happy.Jazz makes this world a BETTER PLACE!God, this is a very very very fine recording.More intelligent than FOX 5 in 200 years!"
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping this book would help to change my thinking and give me a positive outlook. But it reads like an encyclopedia. I find myself struggling to stay awake and pay attention to what I am reading. I never made it very far into this book and dont see myself attempting to read it again anytime soon. Also, the heavy religious influence was a real turn-off for me. Not was I was expecting at all."
2,Very Christian book,"The most important thing to know about this book, is that it is very Christian based. The author is a Preacher, so a question of how to ""Believe in Yourself"" is answered with ""I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me""; and ""How to have a Peaceful Mind"" is answered with ""Read the Bible"".If you're a Christian, or open to Christianity, this book will strengthen your faith; otherwise, this book will leave you flat."
4,One Aspect of Thinking Skills,"As a book on positive thinking, this is *the* book to read.However, you don't become successful by positive thinkingalone. You need negative thinking sometimes. When buyinga stock, you need to look at the risks. You sometimes needcreative thinking in your work. You need to think abouthow others will think, feel, and perceive your service orproduct.Therefore, as a thinking skill book, it only covers one aspect.I think the title is appropriate.I don't consider this a Christian book but a thinking skills book.Note: I'm referring to the original version. This is the miniatureversion according to other reviews. Amazon got themmixed up."
4,too much Christianity,"This book is certainly great. it is replete with a lot of advice to overcome hardship. But I think all the book is about the power of Christianity in generating positive thinking to overcome hardship and have a happier life. if you are not Christian and want to purchase the book, be aware of that."
2,not useful,"I read this book 30 years ago, when I was a troubled youth.Somehow, it does not translate well to my current life."
2,Very christian pep book. Not as good as prayer.,"A bit to much jesus and too little real inspiration otherwise. I suppose that this is a good book if this is what you're looking for, but useless if you're not looking a christian message."
2,The Power of Being a Good Christian,"That should be the title of the book. Positive thinking? Um, very minimal. Oh yeh, did I mention you need to think postively? This book refers alot to the Bible. I don't have any problems with that, but I thought the title is pretty misleading. If you don't convert to Christianity after reading this book, I don't know what will. This book leans more to God for help than positive thinking. OK, maybe postive thinking is thinking about God, but how about people not religious? Again, not the best title. I got fooled by the title, decided to read it anyway, and was very disappointed."
1,Caveat Emptor! This thing's a joke,"I can't believe I paid $4 for a Christmas tree ornament. C'mon! Someone needs to put the words ""MINIATURE"" in the title of the product. This one's going in the trash."
1,Worst Book EVER,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. Do not buy this book. Save yourself the 1.65 and the time. In this book Peale uses faulty induction and touts that his method of positive thinking is ""scientifically proven"". This guy should go back to grade school and study the principles of induction and re-read the definition of science. Science is based on empirical data, in other words things that can be quantified, observed, or measured. Additionally I highly doubt that God, being the 'all-knowing' god he is, would care how ""big"", as Peale puts it, your prayers are. The bottom line is Norman Vincent Peale is off his rocker and the only reason he sold 2 million copies, if you can believe him on that, is because of those moronic religious saps that fill up the 'red states'. Those people will buy anything if they think it will get them into heaven."
1,heard it before,"way to bible based for me.the bible may be a great book, but after u read Ovid'd metamorphis, u can't believe a word in it. and this guy is way to connected to that book( the bible). waste of money and time."
1,Nope,"No, no, no, no. Don't buy this book, it totally doesn't work. Nothing changes, nothing gets better using this stuff. Not a thing. You start to think, hey maybe this stuff will work, but guess what? IT DOES NOT. It's a waste of time like everything else I've ever tried to improve myself, just a trip down the dark tunnel of parasuicidal depression, it always is, it never gets better. Even this book doesn't help. Never could and never would. Might as well read Kurt Cobain's diary for natural mood enhancement. Why bother? I sure won't anymore."
2,Power of Positive Thinking- Audio Version,"I have read the printed version of this book many years ago. I was aware of it's content. The media I received was of good quality and was packed well when shipped to me. The audio on this CD was very good too. I was however a little disappointed with how abridged this audio version was, compared to the original work. Also it appears that the publisher made a copy of a audio version originally distributed on cassette. What content there is on the CD is of good quality but a lot of the material is missing."
2,Can't think positive unless you read the Bible??,"This book is definitely only for Christians.I am a spiritual person and have a lot of appreciation for the teachings in the Bible, but Peale repeatedly insists that self-confidence cannot be acheived without faith in the Bible and practicing Christianity. Peale didn't consider that folks of different faiths might also benefit from his positive thinking techniques.Too bad, I was looking forward to this one."
3,ok..good thoughts,"I'm probably one of few who found this book mediocre. I purchased it because I found it on a list of famous people's favorite books & decided to give it a try. The positive thinking relates back to the bible in all cases. Wading through the anticdotes was cumbersome for me. I suppose I'm more of a bottom line person. However, I did appreciate the thoughts and messages. I intended to share this with my 13 year old son because what kid doesn't need some positive thinking in their lives these days? But, I think he would find the style outdated."
1,Buyer beware,"This is not a self-help book how to influence your approach/thinking to improve results/lifestyle etc. It is a heavily relilgious book which tries to convince you that the only way to get there is through chirstian faith. So if you are not a very religious person, an atheist, pantheist, or of other believes - well, thats it. Nowhere in the description of the book this is mentioned, not in the title or the cover text. Truly false advertising, in my opinion. I send it right back to Amazon."
1,"A read for the ""Believer"", otherwise give it a miss","I have read a number of self-help books and this is the only one I have really had a strong, NEGATIVE reaction to.The only message this book conveys is that FAITH (and more specifically faith in God) is the key to success and happiness. For those that are religious this book might be a positive affirmation for your beliefs and therefore provide you with a motivational ""push"".However, For those who seek something that provides some strategies or ideas on how to make a behavioural change that will positively contribute to the results you seek then I would look else where. Actually, I would recommend you do not purchase this book. You may end up like me, getting really angry with what the author is saying, that you end up throwing the book (and hence some of your hard earned) away."
1,Gospel on tape,"While he has some good points and positive thinking can be very powerful, some go overboard with it. I was looking for something more along the lines of building self-esteem to help encourage me to pursue my dreams and this is more of a Sunday morning gospel. Not what I had in mind."
2,This book was ok,"Someone gave me this book as a gift and looking at the cover, I thought that it would actually be a great book since several million copies were sold. But I read it and it didnt seem to help me as I thought it would. I am not a religious person and this book was filled with Christian stuff. Every other sentence has a reference to god or praying or whatever. And the anecdotes were interesting in the beginning but there were too many of them. Towards the end, I was bored out of my mind. Mr. Peale repeats the same things over and over and over... I think this book didnt help me because I am not a Christian. According to Norman, I probably wouldnt be able to have a positive view of life if I don't pray, read the Bible, and think about god all the time. But I guess it would work or at least be a fairly pleasant read if you are Christian. So, buy this book if youre Christian, and don't buy it if you're not."
3,"Very religious, but has some good ideas.","This book was too religious for an agnostic person like myself. However, there were some good suggestions for positive thinking. I thought ""Beyond Positive Thinking"" was a much better book."
5,Positively FANTASTIC,"I have always considered myself a positive thinker, but then I saw Norman Peale's book. WOW. Even though he's of a different religion than I am, the meaning was univeral.I have read and re-read this paperbook so may times it's literally held together with tape and a rubberband. I can't stress enough....if you feel overwhelmed, totally stressed, depressed or down and think there's nothing you can do...THINK AGAIN. In fact Think Positively. This book changed my life, and as corny as that may sound, it can do the same for you. What have you got to lose? nothing. What have you got to gain? EVERYTHING."
5,A classic handbook on personal transformation,One of the first books I read on the topic of personal transformation. Still a classic. Feeling good about yourself is something that you can cultivate through careful attention to your inner thoughts and beliefs about yourself and your world. If these are negative and limiting then you will experience low self-esteem. We need to work carefully with the emotional energy that is invested in these inner patterns of habitual thought as is described so well in this book. As a psychotherapist I find that working on changing inner beliefs is greatly facilitated by mindfulness meditation and developing a caring mindfulness relationship with the underlying emotions that fuel the problems of negativity. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon.
4,The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale,"The Power of Positive Thinking is just about that, unlocking the power that arises from thinking and acting positively all the time. I come from a continent (Africa) with its fair share of challenges, and the resulting feeling of powerlessness, dejection and hopelessness by millions of people. Many cite various daily perennial challenges like bad corporate and national governance and cannot see the way out. However, Norman Vincent Peale shows that through conscious positive thinking, actions and prayers, each of us can make a big difference. Positive thoughts and actions are contagious and they have to start from you and me. From there, it is amazing the positive difference this can make to those around us and beyond. This book is highly recommended so that we can all change our lives for the better and win success through positive thinking."
5,A classic,A classic is an understatement. I think this should be required reading. Peale puts in simple text how to grab hold of what is between your ears and point it into a positive direction. A huge difference can be made through conscious positive thinking. I fall off the wagon frequently and grab my well-worn book off the shelf to help me ride again.A friend of mine is always positive. It seemed contagious and I was always happy around him. I asked his secret and he introduced me to the life changing book. I grew up in a very negative environment and admittedly have a long way to go but apprecitate the help.
2,More about religious thinking and less about positive thinking...,"I started reading this book with great hope of getting some push on positive thinking. But, even after reading 70 pages I could not find anything that is closely related to positive thinking. The writer, through out the book, was telling that reading the bible is solution for all problems.I myself is very religious and I have nothing against the content of the book, but the title is not apt. I would have given atleast four stars if it would have been titiled ""power of bible"".Once again, this book is just promoting religion/bible and it is not any thing about positive thinking."
4,The Power of Positive Thinking,Very good book. I did not relize it was a paper back I though it was a hard cover but that does not change the read.
5,Hope and Encouragement,"This book has changed lives. Norman Vincent Peale writes simply and profoundly, and with warmth and caring -- instilling courage, hope and confidence. Get a copy of this book for you or someone you care about, and read it cover to cover"
2,Not impressed,I bought this book based on the reviews I read. It wasn't what I expected. I felt that the content was something that anyone with common sense would already know. One could also get the same results from going to Church with regard to the advice regarding praising the Lord everyday. The voice of Norman Vincent Peale was also very annoying. It may have been more bearable had they used a professionals voice. His voice was scratchy and crackly. Last of all... It was very short. Not enough content for the price. I'm tossing this CD as Its of no use.
1,Bible Basher,"I really wish I had properly read the reviews, especially the negative ones, as I did not spot that this was a Christian based book. I am not anti-christian, I just want to be able to think positively, as the title might suggest it can bring. But this book will only help you if you have an open mind to that religion. Otherwise you will not gain much from it at all."
5,VERY motivating FANTASTIC book!,"This book will change your life! You will never go through any situation the same way again! Your thinking will change, your actions will change and all for the better! This book contains the solution to every problem there is and ever will be. If you are seeking to build your faith to overcome obstacles in your life this book will do it. This book reminds me of the fact that anything is possible with God! I almost didn't buy this book because of some comments I'd read on certain Christian websites about the author. But I had the condensed version at home and loved it, so after reading all 45 reviews on this book with 99.9% of them being in favor of the book I went ahead and bought it and I'm VERY glad I did! I am over halfway through with this book and I count it 2nd in importance only to the Bible! Do yourself a favor that will last a lifetime and buy this book NOW!"
1,Check your library before buying,"Personally, I got turned off by the introduction & the 1st page I opened this book to:Introduction - The trick of positive thinking is to be a good christian?=> What about non-religious people? Are we cursed?1st page - You live in the best country in the world (referring to US)=> Wouldn't it be an unfair judgement to call US ""THE BEST"" country?"
1,One Tiny Book From a Small-Minded Vendor,"The book deserves 5 stars for content and its message but only one star for the fact that the book had such a terribly offensive odor I coulsd not read it! I keep it sealed in air tight package to remimd me to avoid marketplace merchandise and further to remind me that Amazon does not exactly jump to it to make things right in such a situation, this experience merits one star or none! Phooey!"
4,PATIENCE.,"I DON'T KNOW WHY I THINK IT TOOK TOO LONG TO GET THE SET OF CD's. BUT, I DO. IT SORT OF DIMINISHES THE HEIGHT OF ENTHUSIASM. HOWEVER, I'VE STARTED LISTENING TO THE CD's AND THEY SOUND IN GOOD ORDER."
4,Wonderful book,"This is the book you must see!!!! It makes me to changing mynegative thinking in my life. I want to introduce this usefulbook to you. Hopfully, you can read over and over tounderstand what's the author point of view. Enjoying!"
1,Do not buy this if you are not religious!,"(sigh) I have heard so much good stuff about this book that I literally could not wait till I received it. However nowhere do the ads (that I recognized) do they let you in on the insipid religious bigotry that permeates the book. If you don't believe in god - then forget it! According to the author you've got no hope. In his mind success and religious spirituality cannot be separated and although there are probably some meritorious elements of the book, they are bastardized by the cheap religious recruitment drive endlessly spewing from the pages. As an atheist I couldn't get through half the book without retching. Consequently it went spinning out of my window and hopefully into a bin.If you are not a fundamentalist Christian who believes in prayer - or you are not easily brainwashed then don't waste your money."
5,Changed my life too!,"This book changed my life. It completely took the ""worry"" out of my life. I now realize and believe that anything is possible. Highly recommend this book."
4,Hallelujah!,"Think positive! Well, that's easier being said than done...This book contains a great deal of wisdom about the mind and knowing how to control (or how to fool) yourself. Most people are caught within their own fears and act on them accordingly. Why?The why-part is being described in this book in great detail and Norman Vincent Peale puts all his knowledge into teaching us how to become and stay positive. It really helped me for a while when I had a bad time at something and has been in my system ever since. It's a great gift to have; not only for yourself, but for the people around you as well!Then why do I rate this book four stars? I think the book is too much god-oriented and hallelujah praise The Lord. Even for people related to a religion this book can cause you to go for a prayer too much. That's not the way it worked for me, but you can find your own way around it.If you don't dislike reading about prayers, buy this book."
1,I'm positive thinking I didn't like the audio tape ....,"It has been some time since I had read this 'famous' book and found that it helped me at a time when I had a loss in the family. The book helped so much that even after some 20 years I can recall some of Dr Peale's suggestions and thoughts quite vividly.I bought this tape to really give it to a friend who is quite depressed, and, not being sure that he would read the book decided to get it in tape. Unfortunately this is certainly not anywhere close to the content of the book. The tape has none of the rich anecdotes and wonderfull stories that the author used to put his point across in the book.Not only is this tape abridged, but is simply and nothing more than a summary of the book.... and, it's depressed me even more than my friend that I was trying to help ...."
2,Little too much preaching...,"Picked this up recently based off the description and the 202 reviews averaging four stars. If you are not looking for religious answers to positive thinking, this is not the book for you. If you are a religious person, this may be up your alley."
2,Disappointing,"The CD was slow, elementary, and did not provide any new insights into positive thinking. I would not recommend this CD for purchaee. Save money and rent it from a library."
3,Dr. Peale,"The power of positve thinking is ok if you want to learn a few successful techniques you can apply to your life. However, there are much better and more intelligent books out there that will give you more sophisticated principles without the religious indoctrination found in Dr. Peale's books. You will be much happier with titles such as: Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz, and Feeling Good by David D. Burns, M.D."
1,$3.49 more for Kindle version? C'mon,"I'd like a copy of this book, but I can think of no reason the Kindle version is $3.49 more than paperback ... can you? ... anyone?No human being must intervene when I buy it for Kindle, no printer was ever used, no paper. The only additional resource used when buying for Kindle is electrons.Of course, the author and publisher should make a profit, but, in the process, you'd think they'd use good sense in pricing their various versions. On Amazon, they'd make $4.20 at the current Kindle price of 11.99. If they dropped the price to match the paperback price, they'd make $5.95.Now which makes more sense ... keep the no-added-work-needed Kindle price high and make $4.20 ... or drop the price to match paperbacks (still with no work added) and make $1.75 MORE?"
2,I'd pass on this one.,"This book had some good ideas, but I felt like prayer & faith were being shoved down my throat. I also didn't like how the author talked about the scientific formula of prayer. It's not that I'm an unfaithfull person, but science and faith are different. In the end, I didn't even finish reading this book."
3,"I Know The Importance of Positiveness Itself,But...","I don't mean to deny 100% of what he was trying to say in this book,but it sounds a bit too religious to me. The author seemed to believe Christianity. So I think he wrote his idea of positive thinking based on his religious point of view. Of course, I'm not saying whether or not I'm interested in Jesus Christ. But I'm afraid I can't promise all of Non-Christians accept his idea with no doubt. I know there is no point in dwelling too much on religion, though.Anyway, I'm not really sure enough all positive thinkers will agree with his religious idea. I could support what he had written in this book if I were a Christian."
1,Quasi-religious,"It's actually about implementing basic religious dogma - and not at all what I expected. I didn't read more than 4 paragraphs before deciding to chuck it.It might be helpful for some but for those who aren't interested in living a life by ""Christ's example"" or in Christ at all, this book is not worth your time.On a positive note, the book became noticeably useless right away so it didn't waste too much of my time."
5,A Wonderful Uplifting Book,"This book is a great motivator. It makes you feel good about yourself and gets you going. It is one of the best classics. If you haven't read this yet, you are missing out!"
5,The Power of Positive Thinking,Fantastic book for those looking to change their thinking and change their life. Should be a required reading for EVERYONE! One must read and believe because everyone has the ability to change their life. Everyone can be happy no matter what they have endured if they read this book and practice it's teachings.
5,Positive Help!,"I think perhaps that everyone, at some point in their life, would benefit from experiencing this book! Take from it what you can/want....but it is indeed POSITIVE and empowers you at a time when you may be living with negative thoughts and outlooks...that keep you from being 'alive and happy'!!!Timeless in it's message!"
3,book - power of positive thinking,"Good, uplifting and helps to remind us that we can do anything we put our minds to."
5,Uplifting!,"I recommend this book for anyone struggling with negativity and unhappy thoughts. Although not a quick fix or a fast read, just reading a few pages at a time works wonders."
2,The Power of Positive Thinking,This audio book was short and not very informative. I took very little away from this. It was overpriced for the content and legnth.
3,Inspirational not Motivational,"I ordered this book based on what I heard other people online saying about it. My expectation was to learn scientifically proven ways on how to properly visualize the things I desire and need the most, and make those things a reality. However, what I received was a book that was filled with lots of spiritual talk, talk that involved something I already know and believe in and that is the power of having faith and knowing the bible. This book quoted various scriptures from the bible and provided me with ways on how to incorporate those scriptures into my daily life. This is something I already know and currently do. Overall I would say this book, to me, is more inspirational than motivational, and I was looking for a motivational book."
4,for more brain power,This is a good guide for a person who wants to gain knowledge about how our brain works.This book has plenty of advise on how to to better understand ourselves.
5,Amazing Book!,This book has helped me through a very rough time in my life when I had nowhere else to turn. I would recommend that everyone get a copy for themselves and those you love! You just might find yourself thinking positively........
5,A must read for every person young and old and all in between,This book is must have for all adults. The information and content are all helpful and inspiring for living your life every day with the best outlook and knowing that the possibilities for your life far exceed your own expectations....Get this book!
5,price ripoff,This is a great book that I read decades ago. The price is a ripoff for a paperback. Get it at your local library.
5,Things I Like,Love them all..................Thanks...Will be ordering more now and then. Mostly Books & Games.Always have a good experience with you all........Thanks Again .......Sharon Lee
2,Hello Kitty Becomes a Princess,"Not what I expected. Did not care for it, and my granddaughter, who loves Hello Kitty and Princesses, didn't even watch it past the first couple of minutes."
5,Hello Kitty Becomes a Princess,My Grandaughter realling like this movie. It was clear. great quality. Very pleased with this purchase. Would reccommend this buyer
4,No option to play all episodes,The remote to our dvd player quit working and cannot navigate to the other episodes so we have only watched the first one. I wish the first option was to watch all episodes!
1,not what we expected....,"I was so disappointed with this dvd. I expected it to have better animation and thought the stories would be fun for my three year old daughter who loves Hello Kitty stuff. I guess I didn't know what to expect and now will not buy anymore Hello Kitty DVDs. She hates it and I really didn't like it much myself. There is no intro into the movie, it just kind of starts..no song, no nothing. Very odd."
2,Not like other Hello Kitty titles,"Please notice the cover says for ages 2-5 - my 8yo daughter, who loves Hello Kitty, does not like this series from MGM. That's all the review I need, but I watched it anyway. It's cheaply done cartoon style is more reminiscent of the Saturday Morning cartoons from the 80s than the Hello Kitty my family knows and loves! I would avoid this title."
3,Handy but by no means exhaustive,"Partly a concordance, partly a topical reference, this text is a good book to have around when you can't quite remember what the Bible says on a certain subject. Although not exhaustive, it is a handy reference to have around when you need something fast."
4,Raw Cane Sugar,I really like this sugar. It's less processed than the sugars you generally find in stores. It's definitely more expense so it's best to buy on a sale day. It has worked great for me used in baking or just in morning coffee.
2,second DVD a complete farse,"The first DVD is very nice but the second it's a compilation of some bonus performances but none of them is complete they just cut them, in other words the idea of a second DVD is to be able to charge you more for really nothing extra worthy."
4,"Excellent, but....","I recommend this DVD. If you like some of these artists you'll enjoy this DVD and likely discover some new artists you'll enjoy.I have just three criticisms:1. The audio mix is excellent, but is two channel stereo only. I would have loved to hear this with surround sound.2. The video work is very good, but it would have been better if they used better quality cameras and matched the cameras better.3. It should also be available in HD on a Blu-Ray disc.There is nothing wrong with the artistry and craft that went into this disc, the improvements I would have liked to see would have cost more money. Perhaps the market for this type of product is too small to justify the extra investment."
2,Self indulgence at best,"Mostly these guys all sound like someone else, Alan Holdsworth, Jeff Beck, Joe Zawinul and others. Very little originality or substance. And how come fusion guitarists never have good tone? It is well recorded I'll say that much."
1,"Gret Movie,But overpriced.","My review is only for the seperate pricing of this dvd,you are better off buying the box set called legends of horror which is cheaper and includes this movie.keep in mind that these money grubbers are selling a slim case version which comes in that box set.This dvd never had a seperate release the other movies included in that set are excellent.these other reviews pretty much covered how great of an investment it would be to buy just this film,which seems kind of bias to sell this overpriced slim case dvd that comes from a set.Mad love is a spectacular film which i highly recommend,but the devil doll is kinda cheesy and doesnt actually have dolls just shrunk people playing the dolls.So if u want to shell out the money for the dvd seperate then great otherwise i highly recommend to buy the box set which includes this and is far more collectible,as a collector buying the seperately would seem incomplete knowing it came from a box set."
4,"Color Magic, where did it go??","I have found that this product, though it does cover small scratches, and does help make the paintlook better, once done polishing with this product, you MUST apply at least three to four coats of a gooodwax, for it to stay on your car, truck ect. If you do not, the next time you wash is, it will come rightoff, and you will need to do it all over again. Good product, just needs a bit of help, to protect it."
4,Why can't I find this in local stores?,"I have been searching for this red wax for years, ever since I used it on my red Prelude's oxidation problem 20 years ago. I couldn't believe how my car looked like it had a new paint job every time I waxed it. Now I have another red car that had gotten some light scratches and was just as pleased as ever with the waxing coverup and shine. The only place I could find Turtle Color Magic Car Polish in Red was online at Amazon. It even has a red colorstick for heavier marks & scratches. Check also for other colors."
3,"Good product, but not dark enough","I bought this product to try and minimize scratches on my dark red Toyota Camry. The label states that the product ""blends with all shades of red"". It doesn't. I'm sure that it would work fine on a light red vehicle, but it didn't work at all on my darker one. I'm not complaining about the product, Turtle Wax is a quality company, but this just didn't work for my car. Make sure you have a lighter red color car if you want it to work."
3,Polish good; chipstik not quite.,"I have a 2002 Rally Red Camaro that I bought this wax for. I've realized that the chipsticks have a variety of color hues and the one I ended up with was ""dark red"". The lighter shades of red would have been better for my particular color; but that's ok because I only have about 3 chips on the entire car. The polish works great for me, and really makes the rally red color 'pop' in the sunlight."
4,it works,"hi friends!!yes color magic works for me have a 98 ford pick-up that still in pretty good shape but needed to cover some small inperfections in the paint i have used this product before couldnt find it local,usually takes a couple of times but it does work with a very good shine also thank you."
2,car scratch remover,This product did nothing for me. It does not do what it advertises.It was the same as putting nothing on my car.
2,Forget the scratch,After using this product I saw a small improvement in the shine. I also had very small scratches and they all can still be seen.
3,"Wax, not much else.","This is a nice product in theory, but f you have a red car and want to wax it, you can buy this product or any other waxing product. It may fill in minor scratches or chips temporarily, but it does not fill in chips or scratches permanently. If you have blemishes in your paint, you might consider a detail service from a detailing shop, but you are probably looking at a paint job scenario."
3,don't expect a miracle,"Well, the dye in the wax certainly turned my rags & hands red, but since my Honda Prelude's paint has a clear coat finish, the dye didn't penetrate into the oxidized red paint. Looks like it's time for a paint job. :("
3,Worked Okay,"This product worked okay but did not solve my problem completely, but it did dramatically reduce the visibility of the scratches in my hood. Unfortunately in my case, I will have to get the car completely repainted to solve my particular issue. At this point, I just overlook the scratches because they are not as noticeable.I think if my scratches were a little less minor I would have spent the extra money and taken the car to have it detailed rather than spend my money on this product."
4,Colored Wax Hides Defects,"This stuff actually works pretty good at covering up nicks and scratches on your vehicle. There's a colored lipstick-like tube that you can use to blob some wax onto the defect and then you apply the liguid wax itself over the bad area. Then buff like you would normal wax.I use this after I've already waxed my car with my regular wax (Meguiars) to just hide the chipped areas that are visible. Regular waxes are normally white and they tend to collect in the nicks and make them even more visible. This colored Turtle Wax is much better at hiding the bad areas. Although the Turtle Wax itself isn't in the same league as some of the better carnauba waxes, it's good enough for the touchup areas.Using Turtle Wax Color Cure is definitely much easier than fooling aroung trying to use touchup paint which never matches and is always a hassle."
2,RED Rag.,"The only thing that stay RED was the rag.And I bought 2 bottles of the stuff.NOT HAPPYTurtle Wax T-375KTR Color Magic Car Polish, Red - 16 oz."
5,mommy dearest,"this was a gr8 example of a movie that shows a mothers love for her son, especially when her sons freedome is at stake. this movie will keep u guessing from start 2 finish. main star was remarkable as mother. i really enjoyed this movie, i think you will 2."
3,Decent Film,I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 if i could..Wasnt great but wasnt bad as well. Above average i guess
3,Expected More,"The trailer is what hooked me in to want to see this badly, the visuals looked awesome and I thought we were going to be riveted by the story-line. Riveting, not really. It was more like just a mother's quest that played out surprisingly banal (compared to what I was expecting via the trailer). It was a very pretty movie though. In hindsight, I wouldn't pay for a hardcopy of the movie but would definitely rent it for a few bucks or catch it streaming."
2,A doxography,"I had to look up ""Doxography"" in the Oxford English Dictionary - it is a collection of philosophical opinions. The book ""Greek Astronomy"" is a Dover reprint of a book written in 1932. It consists of a long (57 pages) introduction followed by a great many quotes (rendered into English) from ancient Greek authors. The selection emphasizes general questions, such as ""Does the Earth move?"" - according to Ptolemy it does not. Perhaps useful as a souce book. But then again, perhaps not."
2,An April Fool's Joke Of A Movie,"George C. Scott was the consummate actor. When the material was superb he rose to the occassion. When it was lousy he didn't embarass himself. ""Bank Shot"" falls into the latter category. As a comedy it's almost completely bereft of laughs. The caper itself is uninvolving. Gower Champion's direction is strictly sitcom pedestrian. The film is also saddled with one of the worst supporting casts imaginable. Too mediocre to truly hate but avoid by all means. Based on the work of renowned crime writer Donald Westlake who should have sued at the very least to get his name taken off the credits. The disc is out of print but I can't imagine anybody clamoring for it."
3,More for collectors ...,"This is the umpteenth heist movie I have seen. Bank Shot has an original story but somehow it failed to convince me. The comedy aspect falls pretty flat, the performance of George C. Scott is very laid back - it is hard to believe the same man played General Patton and other energetic characters. His exaggerated eyebrows must be one of the weirdest make ups in movie history. Curiously only a year before someone released a similar comedy misfire based on a Donald Westlake novel - The Hot Rock, with Robert Redford in a similar role like George C. Scott and with a similarly unconvincing performance. Anybody who liked The Hot Rock will like Bank Shot, one might deduce."
4,Good Second Act,"Beggars Opera are one of the lesser known British heavy prog groups (along with the likes of Cressida, Spring, Gravy Train, Steamhammer or Warhorse). And there are similarities to those bands too. Waters of Change is sometimes quoted as their best album, but, for me, it pales next to the raw energy of their debut ""Act One"". By this album, they had acquired a mellotron and more vocal polish from singer Martin Griffiths. It kicks off with ""Time Machine"", one of their best tracks featuring phasing, great use of keyboards and mellotron. The rest is not up to the same standard, though ""Silver Peacock"" is a standout track as well. It can get a bit clumsy in spots, but it's still a great album for those liking keyboard heavy prog in the vein of the bands previously mentioned."
4,Must order hard-to-find screws to rack mount,"This mixer is a workhorse that sounds great, but it is not rack mountable as ordered. Yes, Mackie sells a rack ear kit. However, the rack ear instructions say to simply remove the mixer screws and put them back in. However, over the rack ears the screws in the mixer are too short to even reach the threads. So I called Mackie parts, but they don't sell the screws. And initially, they didn't know what the threads are either...it's not in their parts list. Later, they were able to find out what the screws are and sent some to me. They are a metric zinc pan head Phillips machine screw, M3.5-0.6 x 8. I found them online for five cents each, plus shipping. Here is the link to these screws at Fastenal.com: [...]"
4,Faulty disks,"The shows are wonderful, but all the disks stop several times in mid program, and have to be started over."
1,"Great warranty, but it doesn't function smoothly","We purchased the Rohl R3810 for a kitchen remodel job and have been plagued with problems with this faucet from day one. My wife HATES this expensive faucet and, while Rohl has a lifetime warranty, they have shipped us new cartridges at no cost, but the faucet still FAILS TO PERFORM. We attempt to use the faucet in a way to conserve water but it is either on full blast or off. It is almost impossible for her to control as it is way too stiff. Additionally the swing spout has become quite difficult to move from lock-to-lock. Next time we will buy a less expensive, but more reliable faucet such as MOEN or DELTA.Price does not equate with quality."
5,Sexy & natural looking,"This is great stuff! This gives me a natural looking blush all day long and I don't have to worry about looking pale and colourless by midday because my blush has worn off or has rubbed off. Doesn't come off until you wash it off. Even with my sensitive skin, I haven't had any breakouts so far. I do dot on more than what the instructions prescribes, but its because my skin tone is darker. I tried it on my lips, and it felt really drying, but my intention for the benetint was only for my cheeks anyway. so no loss there. Totally worth the money."
2,Great Quesadillas But,This made great quesadillas. Quick and was easy to clean. But the warming cover is obnoxious and keep flopping open. After a couple months of use the latch (which did not close/open easily) broke.
5,Mmmmmmm! And NO CALORIES!,"I have used every flavor of Splenda Flavor Blends for Coffee, and I love them all!Because of the convenient packaging, you can a few of them in your pocket or purse, and have one of those fancy coffee drinks -- even if you're in a fast food joint! Now, that's class!Love it!"
4,Funny and Entertaining,"A surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable film, with fast-paced action and excellent humor. Get the original Hong Kong release from eday!"
4,Excellent Start,"Sassy, brassy, brilliant and crude, Red Pocket operate in a rare air between The Roches, Meredith Monk and the Ramones, a funky art-punk full of wit and sexual directness. On the liner notes the artists quote Muriel Rukeyser: ""What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? The world would split open."" One takes it for the album's intent, and if they sometimes mistake cleverness for truth, frank language for honesty, it is, nonetheless, a compelling opening salvo in what could be a highly significant career."
5,Love,This is one of my favorite books. The author is a genius at gripping you with her writing style. Simply amazing.
3,It's not as bad as some of the others...,"For standard 'dispute letter' type credit repair (the type that is used by most credit repair companies) I'd recommend ""The Guerrilla Guide to Credit Repair"" by Todd Bierman & Nathaniel Wice.. even THIS BOOK makes the same recomendation. But, when and if things get sticky and results are lagging and you have accounts that are legitametly NOT YOURS or NOT CORRECTLY REPORTED and you are prepared to use your legal rights to the fullest extent of the law to protect yourself, then this is a good book. If you are serious about repairing your own credit, then I'd recomend getting this book and the Guerrilla Guide both. The average person however, would benefit most from the Guerilla Guide book by (one of) the same authors as this book."
4,This book taught me Credit Bureau Kung Fu!,"I know it sounds crazy, but after reading this book I felt like I knew Kung Fu when I was dealing with the Credit Bureaus and my past creditors. I had wonderful success prior to this book with the strategies that I learned from ""Guerrilla Guide to Credit Repair"", but when I started using the strategies from this book, I took it up a notch. In a few instances my creditors read the letters that I developed from reading this book, and simply gave in to my requests. The straetgies require a little time (A few months)a little typing and a little postage, but it yields amazing success. In fact, I have even begun helping others to recover their credit. God Bless Todd Bierman and Nathaniel Wice."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because ""Guerrilla Guide to Credit Repair"" was very informative, but I wasted my money. The book is a big ad for the author's new Credit Insider online magazine that costs a mere one hundred and twenty five dollars a year. Since ""Guerrilla Guide to Credit Repair"" was published in 1994, I was hoping for some updated information, but there was nothing new in the book. It wasted a lot of space on forms that you would be sent anyway if you needed to fill them out. Too much space was also wasted on discussing how you could take the credit reporting bureaus to court and it appeared to me that key points may have been left out. Guess you have to buy the magazine to get all the good advice. Spend your money on a better book."
3,Good,"As the author of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets and a Certified Credit Consultant, I found the following areas of the book to be very helpful to the average consumer. How to negotiate for an unrated account, getting forecloses off of your credit report, how to stall creditors when you can't pay, how to deal with defaulted mortgages, and credit negotiation. I thought the book covered very general topics on credit repair, but focused more on suing the credit bureaus."
4,It Did it's Job,It works well in a crowd of 100 for the sound system. It is serving its purpose just fine. Fast Shipping. Thank You
4,Checking Sound Levels,Got this to 'see' the level of the sound intensity around me from various home productsas I have diminished hearing from military duty and Vietnam.Sort of like getting 'bundled' software you didn't request on a computer. Thereare buttons and features that just make the operation a bit more difficult but onedoesn't have to use them.
4,Good value for the price,"I did some testing with the product to see how repeatable it is and found the manual range setting to be more repeatable (and probably more accurate) than the auto ranging. I'm measuring some equipment that has a short duration noise spike, which is typically hard to measure. In the fast mode and with manual ranging, it does a good job with this and gives a repeatable reading.I don't have anything to calibrate it with, so I can't comment on accuracy, but it appears to read about what I expect it to. The owners manual is adequate, but the user interface is not intuitive, so keep the manual with the tool, as you will need it again if you have not used the tool in a few months. The memory hold feature works as stated and is easy to use. Quality is good, about what you would expect at this price."
5,Sound Meter,"Easy to set up, works well. Was shipped promtly. Unit can be calibrated by Mfr if you need an official reading."
1,Unacceptable for serious work.,"I have had to send two of these back for the same reason. When I returned the first one, the company said it must have been a defective unit, but the replacement one does the same thing.The problem is that the MIN/MAX function does not work properly. Even when recording very steady sine wave acoustic signals well within the device's measurement range, the unit often reports that the MAX signal value encountered during the recording period was too LO to be recorded. And about as often, that the MIN signal level encountered was too HI to be recorded. This obviously makes no sense, and points to a problem with the device's data acquisition or a software bug.If you just want to look at the numbers flickering by and make a guess about maximum, minimum, and average values over a time period, this might work for you, but for any serious quantitative engineering or scientific work, forget it. It's a hobbyist level tool at best, not a professional tool."
4,Worth the money,"Took just a few minutes to figure out the tool . You'll find that reading the manual first helps a lot since there are several mode. Something that is not mentioned in the sales literature or website is the accuracy. If you are looking for super accurate, then you will need to buy other equipment to calibrate this each time you use it. However, it seems to be very consistent during a session of use. Worth the money."
3,Did not live up to expectations,"Did not live up to expectations, drags a bit, hard for an adult to sit through and watch."
4,Cute and Funny,"Got this for my daughter for Easter. She is 3, almost 4. She LOVES it. Has watched it over and over. It's not epic animation, and some of the jokes based on very grown-up movies from the 70's and 80's go right over her head. But not in a bad way. The cartoons are perfect for her age and not too negative, as some early cartoons are. My 7 yr old son also watched it, and thought it was okay -he was concerned it might be too girly- but it isn't especially. I thought it was cute, and pretty funny in parts. I particularly liked the Star Wars (May the Fur Be With You) cartoon. Overall, I'd reccomend it."
5,price,I can't believe I paid here over $11..big mistakeon my part should checked local first...just paid under $ 3.00 for 16 oz at our local Publixrated a 5 * for the item...
5,Hodgson Mill Oat Bran,"Delicious, nutritious, and filling.I like mine with honey and soymilk.I purchased this at a local grocery and it wasn't at all expensive."
2,"Standard 80's Action flick--No plot, lots of Violence","If you want a good laugh or two, then this is the movie for you. The acting is chessy, the violence is plentiful and best of all the plot is nonexistent, so you can sit back relax have a few beers and relive the glory of the 80's."
3,It's Dirty Bronson v Scum Prostitution Ring.,"Charles Bronson plays a rage-aholic, Japanese hating cop that, ironically, has to search the LA under belly for a Japanese businessman's abducted daughter. Typical fist and gun fights follow. Some shallow attempts at character complexity fail to lift this J. Lee Thompson directed thriller above the average mark, but fans will find it entertaining enough."
1,Trash,"This movie has to be the low point of Charles Bronson's career. The subject matter in this film is sick and disturbing and the plot is dubious at best.The characters in this film are either pathetic or dispicable and don't deserve the viewer's sympathy. Bronson's Lieutenant Crowe is an acerbic, manipulative cop who is just as contemptible as the rest of the cast and by the end of the movie, you wish someone would lock him up and throw away the key.""Kinjite"" is a film that some will find offensive as there are a lot of religious, racial and ethnic stereotypes in this film. In light of this, I'm surprised that the movie's producers didn't receive more wide-spread condemnation. I found this movie to be nothing more than vile trash and it really deserves a zero. I would advise anyone with a modicum of decency and sensibility to avoid it."
1,Just read Starship Troopers and the Forever War instead.,"This book was incredibly simplistic and felt like it had been written over a long weekend. Nothing really original, no developed characters, and even the military stuff felt flat, uninspired, and unoriginal.Compare the military stuff in here to ""Iron Sunrise"" by Charles Stross and you'll see what I mean. There are way better ways to get your space marine fix."
5,great Sc-fi..even if you haven't played the game,"wow, I was REALLy surprised by this book...being a fan of the x-box game and its sequel, I really enjoyed this one...some may be surprised that a book based on a video game is as good as this one is....well, what is a video game other than an interactive story? well, not all of them are, but Halo's story is one of the many things that made the first game so great...I knew the source material was there...that the basis for a great book based on the game could be written...I was just surprised that Eric Nylund executed it so well...for those who aren't into games or haven't played Halo, don't let that keep you from trying this book out..it's great sc-fi, bar none...for those who have played the game, we get to learn what makes the Master Cheif tick and what makes him a complete and utter a** kicker...great stuff!"
5,Are you kidding me?,"IT's HALO!!!! The Ring World! The Great Arch! We'll find it one day, or make it ourselves! Read the books, buy the game, then buy the books by Larry Niven and read what scientists have said about creating a Giant Halo around the Earth or the Moon and about how that is probably the next step in colonization of the Moon (or space)."
5,fall of reach,A must read for any halo fan a great work of literature and craft Eric nylund should be commended on the masterpiece
3,it's okay,"I bought the original Halo trilogy in hopes to write a paper on the hero archetype and Master Chief. This first book has been decent, and I didn't have to plod through, but the second book (by a different author) is terrible."
5,More Halo Goodness,"This book is really good. The best part about it is that it gives you really good information about the stuff you didn't get to see, or experience in the game(since it's a prequel to the game). It gives you background information about Master Chief, Cortana, Captain Keyes, The Covenant, Master Chief's armor(MJOLNIR), The Spartan Project...everything!. The story begins with Master Chief as a kid, so imagine how much it covers...The author also does a great job of keeping the story interesting and original.To anyone that wants to really understand, and expand their knowledge about the world of Halo...Buy it..Now!"
5,Halo The Fall of Reach,I really enjoyed reading this book. I was a lot like the video game on Xbox. I found the characters to be interesting and believable. The plot was easy to follow and kept me into the story. I recommend this book for anyone who likes the game Halo. I am looking forward to reading the other Halo books.
4,Fall of Reach: a must read for any Halo fan and sci-fi enthusiast.,"As a huge fan of the video game, I desired a greater understanding of the Halo universe. This book provides just that with enough excitment to keep me reading all night. Parts of this book even brought me back to Ender's game. I look forward to reading the rest of the literature about Halo."
5,From a Halo fan,"If you are a fan of the Xbox game Halo then you should at least read this book.It is a quite well crafted prequel to the game and finishes at the point the game begins. It tells the back-story of the Master Chief and Captain Keyes and explains their relationship. It also gives an insight of the ""bigger picture"" explaining the war between Humans and the Covenant and why the Master Chief is the only SPARTAN still alive...perhaps.The games story is quite interesting but reading this book before playing creates an extremely rich sci-fi universe to run around in and blow up. Great stuff, much better than Halo: The Flood."
3,Nylund does it again,"Eric Nylund is very quickly filtering up the list of my favorite Sci Fi authors. Here in the Fall of Reach we see another virtuoso performance by a master of the Sci Fi genre. I was unable to give this book five stars because I felt Nylund was somewhat constricted by the Halo franchise. If you have read the Signal to Noise series you know how much Eric strains himself to hold back on truly deep exploration of the Cortana figure. Her whole character is RIPE for development by an author like Nylund.As a warning there is not as much space battle in this book as the first one in the series. It is mostly a Master Chief POV/special ops perspective. I don't think that is where Nylund would have gone naturally.I gave the book only three stars because I think Nylund was forced to write ""inside the box"". However he did a MUCH better job than did Dietz (that man should have all his writing tools confiscated)."
4,fast read .,"the book was a fast read and was well written, felt a little rushed. but the action was fun to read!"
4,A definate must read,"This is a grat book and wonderfully wrote. It takes from earth, to the depts of the planet Halo. I haven't read all the book, but sor far, I agree, it would make a killer movie!!!"
4,Awesome!,This book is great but there are things that you wouldn't understand if you have never played halo. I suggest playing halo 1 (combat evolved) first. Overall a great read!
4,Halo Fans - The Novels Fill in the Gaps,"I am a hopeless gamer. I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy stories, movies, and television. From the inception of the Halo series by Bungie, I was hooked. Halo: The Fall of Reach recounts what the final chapter of the Microsoft/Bungie software collaboration started. A great read to fill in why we see so many SPARTAN-class soldiers. This book was a nice complement to the game that followed it."
4,"Bad Title, Good Book","The book shouldn't be called The Fall of Reach, because that happens at the end of the book. It deals mainly with the development of the SPARTAN-II subjects from day one and the various events leading up to the X-Box game. Otherwise very enjoyable."
3,unique plot,"Eric Nylund's ""The Fall of Reach"" was well-written novel with great characters. Although the plot was good, i think this novel failed to address the emotional side of the Spartans and other key characters. This could be due to the fact that the Spartans aren't capable of having too much emotion. Some of the terminology used was also a little confusing (partly due to the fact that it was my first true sci-fic novel.)Yet overall i enjoyed the change."
3,ok,Its a great book if you like the game. The book tries to tell about 3 different people so you will be reading about one person and then the next chapter it will be someone else. They don't finish some of the stuff like you will be reading about him in the middle of something then the chapters over and you haft to figure out the rest. Over all it gets 3 stars. If it was just on the main charactor John like the book is about it would get 5 and if it explaind more.
3,Sketchy at Best,"This book is only good for one thing and that is giving a ROUGH overview of what happened before the game of Halo. It is not an indepth read. The characters are not fully developed for the most part. The plot is definitely there but the author decided not to fill in the parts between the major points of plot with anything to really make the characters more human. Masterchief is John-117. No last name. No family history. And you get no sense of any family from any of the characters. When I step back away from the book I wonder ""why are they fighting?"". They rarely go into anything that would prove they're fighting and protecting something that means more to them than their lives.Overall this is a book that you read if you want a quick, easy read that won't tax your brain."
5,Halo: The Fall of Reach,"I am an avid gamer myself, not many games can really intrigue me. I played the game Halo the plot-line from the beggining is difficult to comprehend. I played through all the missions had fun, exept for the concrete storyline the game in almost all aspects perfect. I was looking for a much more in-depth view of the game. When i came across The Fall of Reach i read the book learned how everything happened how The Covenant came to be and who Master Cheif really was. I believe that Eric Nylund did a very good job in making this book. He put interesting twists and turns in it. All in all i would give this book a 10/10 for anyone who likes to play Sci-Fi first person shooter games, or anyone whos just bored."
5,(T.B.K.A.)..This Book Kicks Ass,This book is awesome i think any one whos thinkingabout buying it should. If you dont I think your dimented.I like this book cause there is a lot of detail and action!
4,Good book to get started with if youre not familiar with the games.,Ive always wondered what the Spartan training regimen was like and what the Spartans di bfore the Covennt came. This book tells it all
4,"Not bad, not bad at all",I was actually surprised by how good this book was. Not bad at all considering it being based on a game and all. If you enjoy the games and like reading sci-fi novels go ahead. Reading about the background of Chief and Cortana is pretty amusing.
5,Halo,This book is really cool about how it talks about what happens before the game. I liked this genre alot. What was cool was that they didn't have the tchnology that the aliens did. Be prepared for another book coming out in the series this one leaves you thinking. Or better yet get the game!
4,Awesome but missing some key elements.,"The first two thirds of the book was great. But after that things got a little weird. First of all when Cortana gets transferred to the Pillar of Autumn. And then when Keyes gets on board, all calm and stuff,where's Noble six handing Keyes Cortana . And where's the Pillar of Autumn's emergency takeoff while Emile and six hold off the Covenant . Also I don't remember Master Chief getting Cortana,I remember six getting her from Halsey to take to Keyes to give to Chief. In fact I don't remember Master Chief popping up or even being mentioned in Halo:Reach at all.I say, if your going to write a book based on a video game franchise, make sure you get all your facts straight."
3,How very microsoft-esque,"I, like most people, was enthralled by the video game, and I bought the book. As far as background information, it was too good. So good, in fact that most of the infromation, I believe, belonged in the game itself. The first part of the book, which tells the story of the Master Chief's childhood. Not surprisingly, even at the age of six, he demonstrated physical leadership over his kindergarten mates. After that, it talks about his and his fellow spartans' developement into soldiers. John, of course, displays the most brilliant tactical mind of them all.Ah...Where have I seen this before!? Ender's Game! that's all the book really is, just a remake! all the important background information about the spartans, the pillar of Autumn, etc. belonged in the game itself. Not a book that you need to pay an extra 6.99 for if you want the full story"
5,Halo: The Fall of Reach - A must-have for anyone!,"I do not own an X-Box, although I have played multiplayer with my friends. That said, I do not know any plot behind Halo. This book brought me into my friends' conversations, in fact placed my Halo knowledge ahead of theirs. This book is completely original excluding the part where soldiers are trained, reminding me of a cross of Starship Troopers and Ender's Game. If you like Sci-Fi, even if you have never heard of Halo, you will LOVE this book!"
4,"Solid, simple read",This is a good book for those who love the Halo series. I found it a bit watered down as a sci-fi / fantasy lover.
3,Good read,This is a good read if you are fan of the games. IT helps to have played the games as this will fill in a lot of character detail and depth.
5,AWESOME BOOK,"I'm a huge Halo fan, but I don't have the game, so I had to get the book. I didn't really expect it to be great, but I was wrong. It was one of the best books I've ever read, and I have read a lot of really good books. It lets you get to know the characters in the game, and a lot that aren't in the game. It also gives a new hatred for the Covenant, and shows why you fight them. If you are a Halo fan, GET THIS BOOK!!"
4,A tribute to Spartans,"Take Steven Pressfields ""Gates of Fire: The Battle of Thermopylae "" and mix in ""Starship Troopers"" and you have "" The Fall of Reach"". The book has the same boot camp and sense of personal sacrifce that make both of those books great. Master Chief emerges as a man behind the armor that any trooper would want to follow into battle. It does not try too hard at being epic ( see Star Wars: New Jedi Order ). I would have given it a five but the editing is bad. Many dates and phrases contridict themselves so it gets annoying after the third or forth time. You thing 35 years have passed and it has only been 25. A guy that has his arm blown off , salutes with the same missing left arm on the next page."
4,Surprisingly Good Pulp Fiction,"I recently finished this book while away on vacation, and was very pleasently surprised by how well-written and indeed intriguing and satisfying this book was. I picked it up just before we left, thinking that a little junk pulp fiction would be appropriate by the beach, but let me tell you the book is not mere pulp. It is a prequel to the game, knowledge of or access to the game is not required in order to understand and benefit from the experience. Certainly the book essentially ends where the game begins, but who knows ... the book may lead to a fulfilling experience in front of your tv/xbox combination."
4,"a great, fun read if you like halo","this is the kind of book that all halo people love because it fills in the blanks that the games don't cover. It talks about the master cheif before halo and what he is (he's not your average human.However, I would suggest you get the set of all three halo books, as i am soon to do."
5,best intersteller combat book yet.,"In this book it talks about what happened before HALO. The Master Chief is a boy and he is abducted at the age of six. he is put through a grueling training,and was surgically altered. then he recived the mjolnir battle suit. he meets cortana and is fitted into the best suit ever made. this book was the best book i've read in a while. because i'm in R.O.T.C. I understand alot of the military words that are used, like LZ or landing zone."
5,this book kicks butt,"this book will knock you off your feet it has action, suspence, and hard core drama"
2,Not What I Expected........,"I purchased this book thinking it was a ""cheat"" to help me get through the levels and found that it's a story. Not exactly what I had expected. No reflection on the book itself for younger readers but those of us ""over 21"" trying to get through the levels of Halo need all the help we can get! This is of no help in this area!"
4,Smooth Pharoah,"Pharoah Sanders is best known for his great avante garde style.The ballards on this album are superb. Straight ahead jazz,thatsrealy enjoyable.I highly recommend this."
4,Nice and relaxing piano music.,"I really like David Lanz's works for piano, and they really fit well in the New Age genre. This book provided me with a lot of songs that I've always wanted to have to play for my collection. Just not quite all of them (thus the 4 out of 5 stars). Though even for most of the songs I have not heard of before, they are becoming enjoyable to play."
5,for aspiring pianists ...,"I took up playing the piano very late in life (relatively speaking - 55). Made it through some of the beginner stuff but wanted to grow. Heard David Lanz on Pandora and thought maybe I could learn some of that. So far, Return to the Heart is the only one I have attempt with any success. He is such a master in his genre that he makes it sound obtainable ... OK, I still have a way to go personally, but I think you enjoy this. Its intermediate in level and then some."
4,Math book,With the budget cuts you sometimes have to get your own copy of a textbook for your child and we were pleased wtih the quality of the book we bought.
2,Never worked,"Never worked, but the vendor did say they would replace it. So good customer service. But I got busy and never sent it back, it was easier just to get another one from an actually store so I would have it right then and not have to wait to get it in the mail.."
4,FUN HALLOWEEN FARE(but parents beware),"This 2 dvd set brings back great memories of the old MOVIE MACABRE show from the 1980's. Lot's of schlocky horror movie fun hosted by one of the all-time hot funny babes, Elvira! The picture quality in both films are bad. I guess that's to be expected. It kinda adds to the ""B"" feeling of the whole production. All in all it's good fun, but parents do beware. The packaging and Amazon rating says the 2 features are rated ""PG"" but there is lot's of nudity scattered throughout both films. These obviously aren't the edited for TV cuts I've seen previously. I'll have to check out the other 2 new Elvira sets now. Recommended!"
4,"There are ""two"" reasons to watch this","...And they're Elvira as the horror host and the movies themselves (what'd you think I meant?) Seriously, though I'll leave the corny jokes to Elvira, and she lets those babies fly... (again, the jokes!)Elvira is extremely hot and I used to sneak watching her on Movie Macabre back in Richmond, VA in the late 80's and early 90's. Loved it and this is great nostalgia. Highly recommended!"
4,A sampling for the curious,"Huchingson does readers a service in compiling a very informative and accessible collection of voices from all corners of the science-faith conversation. For those looking to explore the connection between scientific inquiry and religious faith; if at all they are reconcileable (which this reviewer thinks thye are, and without compromising the integrity of either), Huchingson's collection provides an amazing starting point from which to view various interpretations of the questions at hand. Contributors run the gamut, from C.S. Lewis and Paul Tillich, to Annie Dillard, to Isaac Asimov and Richard Dawkins. Huchingson is fair in allowing for voices in all corners of this conversation to have a place in his collection.I would especially reccomend this for college undergrads and other ""introductory"" folks."
1,I could have found this at the dollar store!,"This item was not even close to what the picture looks like. It was faded and poorly made! My daughter still has it, but all the pieces have fallen off it, and it's only handled when trying to put money it it."
5,Useful compilation of data,"I have not found the same level of errors as the previous reviewer mainly because I am in a different field of planetary science, and I really appreciated having a useful and readily available text as a source of data. The chemical tables are excellent and rigorous, as one would expect from two planetary chemists. The meteorite data compilation is among the best I've ever seen. Planetary data is accurate to the mid-1990s, and is excellent for quick calculations. References are given for all tables, and should be conferred with prior to publishing anything.Since my field area is rather varied (astrobiology), this book fills a special void in that it compiles data from numerous subjects. If I need to know the mass of Europa, the abundance and location of S class asteroids, and the escape velocity of Mars, this text has it in a fairly easy to find format."
1,I didn't like it,"When I was a kid, I liked to draw and had aspirations of becoming a cartoonist. Then someone gave me this depressing book as a gift and I haven't draw a thing since.I don't even remember what it was about except the kid's family was dysfunctional with the mother caring the most about her first born who had already left home and the title character escaping his dull his life by drawing cartoons in the attic. This gets threatened when the older brother need a place to stay with his wife and will likely move into the attic. But this all got resolved somehow and it left me with a bland taste in my mouth. I'm surprised this book didn't turn me off reading in general, come to think of it.In the end, I really didn't care for it and the main thing I took away from it after all these years was that I really didn't like it."
1,Very unhappy,"Forget the SmartBox and the Amazing Box. Been there done that. Both have been totally unreliable for me with Windows XP. After much frustration and no real technical support, I went with the Vikant Ultimate Box. It works like a dream and writes to both the Smart Box Blank Card and the Amazing Box Blank Card. It is fabulous! If you have never purchased a box before, start with this one. If you have any other box, and its giving you fits, buy this one. You will be glad you did."
5,I love it!,"This system is great! The only drawback is that I had to go to Simplicity's website to get an update before the thing would work (It would have been great if the update had been included as a disk or if, at least, there had been a slip of paper in the box to let me know to download the update. Fortunately, I had read other reviews, and when the machine wouldn't work properly, I thought to go to the website). I love the flexibility the system provides: I'm no longer limited to the cards with pre-set designs. I was able to embroider my son a Classic Pooh shirt for his one-year birthday. It was adorable!"
4,great service,"had some trouble with the original order but the company took care of that promptly and issued a credit while providing me with a way to send back the incorrect item at no cost to me. the chair itself is what I wanted, light weight, easily folds, and fits easily in my car. It was easy to customize for my husband's disabilities, pushes easy thru my narrow hallways, and can be moved by a one armed, one legged individual...which I never expected to happen, so I am quite please with the product and service."
2,no title,"This was OK, very sparsely written, probably intentionally so, about two Jewish sisters trying to hide in Germany during World War II. There were too many characters, too many names that appeared for only a page or two. And what she says was the most harrowing experience of the whole journey, that ""brought us to the edge of the abyss"" is glossed over in a few paragraphs. It just wasn't detailed enough for me, in spite of the obvious richness of experience there must have been. It was as if the author was compelled to write this, but not too much, or it would be too painful. Like reading a journalist's account, not a novelist's. The author was perhaps too close to the material to do it justice. It was in the Hemmingway style, sparse and terse. Were it not for the journey related, the writing would not be good. A much better book to read on this subject, and an autobiography, is ""100 Cigarettes and a bottle of vodka"" by Arthur Schaller."
3,Nice and cute for a love story,"As far as an attempt at an uplifting and romantic movie goes, I would say it was unique. The story was interesting at times, but the overall cheesiness of each character was a bit overwhelming. Although this doesn't reflect how I feel towards each actors' abilities, this movie did not do them justice. The roles should have been given to actors just starting the business, not ones trying to keep the paychecks coming in. All in all, if you want to see a movie on a quiet night to pass the time, this movie would be recommended. Otherwise, I probably will not go out of my way to see it again."
3,Curious and entertaining ROMCOM type movie,"quirky characters, interesting though lightweight story. Jensen Ackles is a laugh with some of the best lines in the movie."
2,Cheesy,"Ok, so I guess this IS a 'chick flick' based on the reviews which highly over-rate this film. I like Elisabeth Harnois in Point Pleasant so opted to watch this. The one girl (Tish) is a tramp so I did not feel that the owner's (Trucker) anger at the 'boyfriend' was as justified as the movie made it seem. The one with the cyber relationship (Jen) was predictable as was the main character with the art student's Dad. Cheesy and not that good really (not terrible but certainly not what the other reviewers are saying)."
4,10 Inch Hero,"Decent movie, but drags in the middle. The ""road trip"" part of the movie was totally unnecessary. The part played by Danneel Harris was badly written, and hence slightly over done, but not as bad as it should have been based on the writing."
5,Heroic Ten Inch Hero -- Love this film!,"If you have not seen TEN INCH HERO (2007), you are missing a well-made, wonderfully acted, and tender movie that does, indeed, make you feel better about the human race after viewing. I know this sounds stuffy, but the film IS great: funny, sweet, and inspiring. Jensen Ackles and his future wife, Danneel Harris, are great in this film, and the rest of the cast (John Doe, Alice Krige, Sean Patrick Flanery, and the rest) are splendid. The acting overall is superb.Although best known for his roles in Dark Angel and Supernatural, Ackles is spectacular in this film -- if you haven't seen him in this very-different role, you will be highly impressed. In my opinion, he should be a major star in a big studio blockbuster film. Hope that somebody puts him in one, and soon.So glad I bought this film; it was WORTH it!"
1,I cannot believe this movie has so many 5 star reviews,"This movie SUCKS. I would give it 0 stars if I could.The writing is bad; the story is full of cliches. I will admit that I did not predict the ""twist"" at the end of the movie (the little girl is not actually her daughter). Whoops, spoiler alert! But the overall ending was just as predictable.So, so, so many awkward moments in this movie where I just wanted to stick a fork in my eye. Do not watch."
4,Wright is Right,N. T. Wright is perhaps the successor to Barclay as far as helping communicate Scripture in the modern environment. I am enjoying thinking with him.
2,To narrow,I tried this item on a queen size Tempur Pedic mattress and the mattress was to thick to get this product around it and carry it . It appears it may work well enough for thinner mattress.
5,Made moving easy,This was used to move a full size mattress up a flight of stairs. The straps made it so much easier to grasp than just holding on to the mattress. I wouldn't move a mattress without a sling carrier ever again.
2,Looking for hardcore jazz and got New Age,"Looking for hardcore Jazz and got New Age. Familiar with Moffett's work on Sonny Sharrock's ""Ask The Ages"", in my opinion, one of the best avante garde jazz allbums ever with an all star crew including Sonny, Charnett, Elvin Jones and Pharoah Sanders."
2,OK .................................just ok!,"Charnett Moffett's post-bop on the upright bass is listenable but his fusion on the electric bass, though creative, is misplaced here. Yes a jazz mixed bag - reasonable post-bop mixed with poor fusion! The album ends on an interesting note with a dissonant interpretation of ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" which is arguably the most inappropriate track on this CD! DO NOT BUY!"
2,It cuts...,"While it did a decent job of cutting the grass, this blade has very little vacuum, and wasn't that great at mulching, and it easily bent. Replaced it with a Gator blade, much improved mulching performance."
2,Breaks easily,"This was bought for a 5 yr. old. When she took it apart to put it together, the top layer of thin wood (on which the design is glued?) broke off on several of the pieces. I had to glue them back on and don't know if they'll stay or if others will come off. Very disappointing from the usual quality of Melissa and Doug products I've come to expect."
2,no picture,I was very disappointed that these puzzles had no picture to follow. I bought them for my 3 year old grandaughter's birthday. She's a whiz at putting puzzles together but it is very difficult for even an adult to do without a picture. There is a small picture glued on the back but it is impossible to peel off. Very unhappy about this purchase.
4,nice product,"It will be a time to discover the full potencial, but the product looks nice, let see if can fulfill the requeirements."
1,Danger beware!,DO NOT USE THIS ON HENKELS KNIVES! The carbide side is way too aggressive for good quality knives. I lightly drew my chef's knife through without any downward pressure and now there are small nicks in the blade. I should have known better than to use a 6 dollar sharpener on my good knives. Live and learn!
1,pissed,II was not impressed with it at all....when it got here i went to sharpen my knife and the damn sharpener was broke..... i would like for u guys to send me a knew one if u could and after a try it i will ratr it better
1,"It was ""so-so""",The sharpness of the blade doesn't last very long and finding a refill is difficult. I will never buy this product again.
3,Works well only when new,"It was working well the first couple of times I used it, however after a month or so it did not sharpen anymore. Anyways it does not sharpen knifes very good. Its a simple knife sharpener, do not expect much."
3,Smith's 2-step sharpener,I purchased this sharpener in the sporting goods department at Wal-Mart for $2.56. It is convenient and does a very good job at sharpening fine-edge knives.
3,Good for work knives,"Worked great on my pocket knives and some other blades.on new kitchen knives it worked ok, but over time I found the carbide side would nick the blades and make them basically serrated.a good quick solution for most knives but not a kitchen staple."
4,Compact design makes it easy to keep handy,"I work in a group home where I'm required to cook regularly. The knives aren't maintained well, and I happily bring my own sharpener to improve the edge before I get to my slicing and dicing. Of course I use it at home as well, who wouldn't? I like the fact that I can slip it into my work bag, and will forget it is there until I need it! There may be better sharpeners out there, but if you need something small to keep with you (or maybe to put with camping gear?) I would recommend this little item."
2,Does not work,"The material that comes out when the coarse side is used is not from the knife, it is from the sharpener. May be my knives has harder material but it sure looks like my knives are cutting the material out of the sharpener."
5,works like it should,"works like a charm. this sharpener works on my knives and our family's kitchen knives. It sharpens to a point but if you want sharper get sharpening stones (the spitting stones), or a grinder (the wheel). Otherwise this is great."
4,Smith Abrasives CCKS 2-step knife sharpener,"Produced a decent, sharp edge on my 3 inch pocket knife blade. However, due to design, I was not able to get the entire blade. The 1/8 inch near the base (part closest to handle) was unable to fit into the slot due to the typical pocket knife design. Also, my well used blade has a couple small nicks, which were still there after sharpening. Likely a stone would be best to remove these. Still, I am happy with the purchase. For a quick edge with little effort it does a great job."
2,No working properly,"It chipped two of my ceramic knives. The first time i assumed either i did not use it well or the knife was not a good one but when it chipped my other knife, i knew it wa the sharpener. The metal part works fine with regular knives."
2,just like other cheap ineffective sharpeners,this sharpener does not work nearly as well as I had hoped. I have purchased other cheaper sharpeners that have worked must better. Not recommended.
3,It's ok,Good for quick simple sharpening of inexpensive knife. I would not try to sharpen my expensive cutting knives with this. It does not give you a fine sharp edge.
4,just great,I had these pretty beat up knifes and my old sharpener stick just wouldn't do it so I got this thing and it worked pretty good. You can still see some dents in one of the knifes but they'll surely go away with more sharpening.
4,Great Little Sharpener,"I saw some folks at work using this. Even an old battered Smith Abrasives sharpener worked as if it was the first time every time. I got one for myself. I am not dissapointed! It takes up almost no room in my drawer in the office. I use my knife frequently to cut fruit, and open care packages (underway on deployment in the Navy), so I also frequently sharpen my knife. It sharpens my pocket knife to a razor's edge! I would caution you to be aware of your hand placement while using this as it can be very easy to cut yourself. For the price, you simply cannot beat it!"
3,too narrow and deep,"With this sharpener it is impossible to sharpen a small edc knife with thumbstuds. You can sharpen part of the blade, but when you get close to the handle, the plastic of the sharpener interferes with the thumbstuds and you can not sharpen the full length. It does however sharpen kitchen knives very well. I can now cut my meat and cheese without effort."
5,Good Little Sharpener,"First of All, don't put your expectations too high for this $5 sharpener. I bought mine at walmart for $5 and it has no complaints. I have used it on numerous knives ranging from small swiss army knives which got sharper in just a few strokes to 11.5'' Bowie knives which took much more time but the result was pleasing. Absolutely 5 stars! Course and fine side, both work well! Don't put to much pressure on the blade as you slide it through however, at the best this will do nothing to your knife, worst result is that it will chip your knife. There is enough friction between the steel of the blade and the sharpener. Great Tool All in All! (Would not recommend for kitchen knives) Seems to be less affective on bigger knives but still gives pleasant result over time"
4,Good value for the price,"This works wonderful for its intended purpose. Do note, the sharpening zone is rather shallow, so you'll have to resharpen often. Also, its sharp, but not razor sharp. No surprising or a dealbreaker in any way though. All in all, a good value sharpener, which I pull out every few days, run my knife through, and am all set."
4,nice little sharpener,"I had thought you couldn't surpass a basic sharpening stone, this is the first knife sharpener of this type which I've tried, it is quite good at quickly putting a nice edge on most knives, but it's not suited to serrated blades or particularly thick blades, also, the design is such that it's not always that easy to hold if it's not on a flat/hard surface, causing you to hold it with your fingers across the path of blade travel, which means that if the blade slips, you get cut with the (now remarkably sharp) knife...this happened to me several times before i realized that maybe i shouldn't do that"
4,It does the job but is not a miracle worker,It's a knife sharpener. It sharpens knives. It's easy to use. The rubber bottom helps keep it steady. I like it. It stores easily. It's bright yellow. What more can I say?The sharpening rods are not replaceable. Don't expect it to do miracles if your knife is nicked or gouged or bent. Don't use it with serrated edges. Don't use it on one-sided Japanese knives. Get and use a good cutting board.
3,Worked Okay,As knife sharpeners go this one proved okay. The overall size could be a little larger which would prove easier to use for someone with larger hands. It is a constant concern that you may cut yourself.
2,Less than I expected,"It doesn't do a very good job of sharpening a knife that has seen perfectly normal use (regular pocket knife just used around the office and at home, mid-grade carbon steel). I would not recomend this product for normal sharpening and definately not for a knife that sees serious but cautious use."
4,Knife Sharpener,This was bought for a gift and was what was wanted by the person.He will use it often on sharpening his knives.
4,Works well for most common use knives,I bought this to sharpen some knives I bought for Christmas presents. The only problem was the edge on the new knives were not the right angle for this sharpener. This did work well for a couple of older knives I had however.
4,amazing for the price,I bought mine at walmart for $3something and for the price its amazing. It wont get you the best edge out there but its still a really nice edge for every day use. Cheap and easy to use.
5,Smith Abrasives CCKS 2-step sharpener,"This is a good little tool.Very handy and easy to store in your tackle box or kitchen drawer.Great for ""keening""up a knife blade edge.Good product & I recommend this to anyone."
2,Not too happy,I try to sharpen my knife but it did not do any thing luckily I had my old one which is still good .
4,2-step knife sharpener,"I rate this better than the red one from Rapala. The ceramic rod side does an excellent job of bringing the edges of my knives, even serated steak knives, to a very sharp edge. Unfortunately, the carbide blade side is worse than useless and actually destroyed the edges on several knives. Only use the ceramic side and you'll love it."
1,What a waste of time and instruments !,"This is - by definition - noise. It makes no sense what so ever to people who would normally listen to jazz - or most kinds of other music. Its basically ""music"" for the guys who play - an experiment, a music rebellion - fine ! but its not a revolution, it does not make any impact. It's ""has been"". And its not ""music"" its an other way of ""expressing your selves"". Its a free world - so buy it if you like - sure. But dont call the people who play for ""great musicians"" - and please refrain for using the term ""JAZZ"". Thats really a joke. My very personal opinion is that its pure crap.M"
2,Poorly written,"Plenty of comprensive data but the author should learn to write.His style is so utterly awkward, he must be speaking some sort of oriental verse.No wonder this book never sold. Way to dull a hill to climb."
5,Great Bonding time with Younger kids,I bought this for my 3 yr old who LOVES puzzles. The pieces are big enough for her to grab and manuever. The pictures are bright and easy enough for her to figure out where the next piece goes. NOT ONLY THAT but it includes static stickers so she can play pretend with the characters. Great gift. I recommend to parents with children 3 and up!!
4,Waiting for the Light,This is the Shirley MacLaine that all have grown to love and respect. Extremely delightful film.
4,Sweet movie,"Our family enjoyed this film. It's not ground breaking in any way, but these enjoyable actors make it worth the time. Shirly MacLaine is fun to watch as a crazy Aunt. Teri Garr is good, but the script doesn't tap into her talents like it could have."
3,Not for the Kindle,I think that the stories are funny but I don't think it works well on the kindle. I have had several pages that will just have a random letter(s) and it can be distracting. There are other pages that are like ads and those are very difficult to read on the kindle.
4,The Bomb I Grew Up With,"This fascinating review of nuclear strategy covers the period from 1945 to 1990. It is extraordinarily clear in presenting the options faced by Presidents and decision makers, and how they resulted in strategy that varied between ""Nuke them back to the Stone Age"" in 1948 to ""MX Racetracks in the Nevada Desert"" in the Caarter and Reagan Administration.I found it a most compelling read, causing me to sacrifice sleep to continue, because it names names, dates, and places. Insight into all the news figures I grew up seeing on TV News.I grew up as an Army Brat in the 1960's and 1970's, and this book explains why many of the weapons systems came and went. In-fact, it explains why our family ""Came and Went"" on a few stations!I highly recommend this if you have even a passing interest in Nuclear War strategy and National Policy, or even in what part you and/or your parents/grandparents played in the ""Big Picture""."
2,Cardboard???,"Well, I don't mind paying [$$] for a dollhouse as long as it is worth the money. And assuming my daughter is going to play with it. :O) I ordered this for Christmas 2004 so she hasn't seen it yet...obviously.But...I'm not impressed. It is made from cardboard!!! It doesn't do anything special. The fisher price little people doll houses are the same price and much better quality. They come with lots of accessories and moving parts!Very disappointed with the value for your money! How durable can this be???"
4,My Daughter Loves it,"My 5 yr. old Daughter loves it, it is cardboard, but sturdy. She pretend plays for hours with this and the babies."
2,Disappointing but luckily only paid $5.00 for it,I agree with the other reviewers - I couldn't tell from reading the box what was included & what wasn't. (...) I think my daughter will enjoy playing with it but it probably won't last long because it doesn't look very sturdy. I would have been very upset if I had paid the original price for this. Most other toy manufacturers make it clearer what's included in their sets and what isn't.
1,Bombcop,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen! It has nothing to do with bomb disposal. How they got the title is beyound me. It's simply another emotionally devoid cop who at the last minute grabs a bunch of wires and saves the universe. It's not worth the money and I am embarassed that a quality company like Amazon even offers it. If your the least bit interested in how bomb squads work, or care about factual representation, steer clear of this flick."
4,Very Insightful,"This is not a happy book, by any stretch of the imagination. It is very enjoyable, however, as the writing is excellent and the true meaning of the story becomes quite evident at the conclusion. There is something about the narrative that made it hard to put the book down every night. I now want to read the sequel!"
5,A perfect work of art,"As others have written, this is truly a masterpiece, a great work, a neglected classic. After a 12-year interval, I recently read it for a second time. Roth's mastery of the prose in this book is astonishing on every page."
3,Wanted to like it more,"I can't put my finger on why this book just seemed average to me. The writing is clear and easy to read. The descriptions are detailed, but not overly so. The characters are fully-fleshed and interesting. The plot is engrossing. So why didn't I like it more? I don't know. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I can't identify with life in a monarchy and I can't stomach the pampered, entitled lifestyle of people who don't deserve such wealth and leisure.Regardless of all that, I did find it interesting that Roth depicted gambling addiction so accurately (or at least as I imagine it to be) long before anyone recognized it as such.While I occasionally felt sorry for the characters, by the end I was just happy to be finished and that I would no longer have to linger in their world."
3,Radetzky March,"The book is interesting, but I was hoping for information on Field Marshall Radetzkysince I am a decendent."
1,No Good!,"While I like this watch and it originally fit great, one of the pins fell out on the first day of wearing it. Android sent me replacement pins and they don't want to work. I have to take it in to repairs and i haven't even been able to wear it! Very unhappy."
3,OK but............,"For me I am fan of Cyrus's seen him live a few times and this has some good stuff.I prefer his work with standards though original material like on ""Earth Stories"" is OK with his Post Bop underpinned by Gospel roots but here the good material like ""For All We Know"" a Duke Medley, ""My Funny Valentine"",""Alone Together"" and a few originals might have worked better latter in his career when his chops were more down (McBride as well maybe though Allen in 1993 seasoned pro).But now with his group Manhattan Trinity is among the ranks of the very best working trio units out their this CD is just OK.It also is expensive in it's limited 2003 release but came out first on Evidence.Find it cheap add it but don't blow big $$$ which you'll need for those excellent M&I; trio M.Trinity like ""Charade"" and ""Alfie""CheersChazz"
3,More information please,"I have purchased several Melissa and Doug puzzles for my adult son who is a brain injury survivor. We love the floor puzzles with large pieces. Unfortunately, there are no dimensions given for this puzzle, so I can't determine if it is appropriate for my son."
4,Love it!,"Another great M&D puzzle. We have several, and this was just as highly rated by the kids as their pirate favorite. Apparently bugs are just as cool! At 60 pieces, this was a little more challenging for my 3-year old, but she still joined in and helped, and we have been having a great time putting this together night after night. As we have come to expect with this company, the colors are nice and vibrant, the pieces hold together well, and the pictures are cute. Two thumbs up from the kids (and mom) for another great puzzle!"
3,"nice picture, pieces don't fit together well","The picture on this puzzle is very colorful and nice. The material feels glossy, really it looks beautiful. However, a lot of the pieces fit together too tightly. I got this for my 3-year old and she had trouble with many of the pieces and wasn't sure if the pieces were the correct one, just because they didn't fit (even though they were supposed to)."
5,My twins love it!,"This toy was a great find, especially for $10, but I would recommend it for any infant learning to sit and play with toys. It sings ""Old McDonald"" every time a block is inserted into the holes which gets my 9 mo. old twins dancing. I love the peek-a-blocks that come with it, too!"
4,Great Bargain,"I bought this for myself as a 'christmas present'. I needed something that would make up the 25.00 so that I could get free shipping. It was such a reasonable price, I really didn't have anything to lose. Well, it turns out the parfum actually smells good. It's a nice 'older' scent. I use it along with my other fragrance to switch up the scents. Nice bargain."
2,Everything sells,"This is a book that you would get for free in your Autodesk package. Very dry run down tutorials. It took me an hour to go through 100 pgs. and get 2 usefull things out of it (1 per 50 pgs. to help you with the math). It probably took even less time to write it. (Sorry if I offended Travis and Neil but take pride in your creations, step back and see if you can actually follow and like what you did).But anyways, book is going back, don't recomend it, I only gave it one extra star just to be nice."
1,Not what you are looking for.....,This is not what we thought it would be. No where does it say it is a book for a computer related course. We were trying to find out metal fabrication information books.... This is not a guide...
4,Sci-fi Fan,I got this because I like Sci-fi and Richard Dean Anderson. I like the beginning of series because the characters seem to come into existence. You'll like it too.
5,"good buy, nice ring",I bought this to wear as a thumb ring. I bought size 9 1/2 (which is what the ring sizer at the jeweler said) but it is a bit snug so I would also recommend buying a size larger. For the price you just can't beat this deal. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple band.
4,shiny,"This is a nice ring for the money. It looks real, very thin just what i wanted. Was shipped quickly will order again like their products."
1,Very Unhappy customer!,"I ordered a ring that stated ""Toe Ring"" in the description. The ring came very quickly but was not a toe ring. I don't know anyone with a size 8 toe. If you know anyone please direct them to this seller! Is it a wedding band, toe ring or thumb ring? Pick one!"
4,Very nice ring,"I was looking for a simple band i could wear to add a feminin touch to my marine corps uniform. it looks awesome, its not showy, or deperate, its simple and delicate.. its not the best material i guess but its fine for what im doing, i recommend it for anyone, im not married and i bought it, i was hesitant at first cause it says "" wedding band"" in reality its just a simplistic band that is nice. i love and reccomend it to anyone. also i bought my regular ring size and it fits perfect!"
2,not worth it,item is very cheap. i have never seen a sterling silver ring that turned dull in a couple of days.
5,plain silver ring,"another great amazon buy! this ring is finished with rhodium, and it looks just like a platinum ring. the price is great. i saw a bunch of reviews saying to get a size bigger in the ring, but i got my size and the ring fits perfectly. maybe just get a half size bigger. i buy form this website almost every week and have not been disappointed with a purchase yet- i love amazon :)"
3,correction,I oredered a 8.5 and it is more like a 8 so if you order order a .5 size larger than you ring size.
5,Sterling Silver 2mm thin,"Love this ring. perfect fit, perfect size. will highly recommend to anyone looking for inexpensive, yet stylish band. cudos to the customer who recommended getting one size larger. try it. you will like it."
2,One ring came apart at the seam,I ordered two of these rings in January to wear on both sides of my diamond. I was very pleased with these rings until one of them came apart where the ring was joined. I am very disappointed that this happened. The rings are beautiful but I can not wear one of them because it now pinches my skin. Maybe I just received a bad ring.
5,Perfect,"I love this ring, it's exactly what I wanted in a thumb ring and it's by far the best price I've found anywhere!"
5,perfect!,"I purchased this to wear both alone, and to help keep on larger rings (since I wear a half size). It is absolutely perfect!"
3,it's okay,"This is an okay silver ring. It had a scratch on the side and inside,so I had to exchange it, but then after I received the exchanged ring, it was a little looser on my finger than the original ring. oh well!The seller was very prompt with service, though, so I do recommend the purchase."
1,I didn't like the product,"The ring is like used, has a rayon and beaten in one side. Money wasted! I did not like it!"
4,"Pretty, but runs small","I ordered this ring in size 3 1/2 after losing weight and having my wedding ring get too big. I ordered size 3.5 but it seems more like a 3 - definitely smaller than the other two size 3.5 rings I bought around the same time. I'm keeping it since I'd like to lose more weight, but I advise ordering up a half a size for best fit."
2,So tiny.,"This is as small as the smallest keyring wire I've ever seen. My niece wanted it for Christmas. It was on her wish list, but I'm embarrassed to give it to her."
5,Perfect and dainty,I bought this ring to wear to work so I don't ruin my original engagement ring.This ring is perfect. I love it!!! Had it for several months and it is still shiny and not beat up at all... and that's saying something since I work my little tail off around the house and at my job.It's dainty and you don't even feel it when you wear it. It's small enough that you can stack other rings with it.I couldn't have asked for more. :-D
4,Works with the Devil,"Duffy and the Devil by Harve and Mrgot Zemach is an excellent book for people of any age group. It is an older book and can be seen through the illustartions. The main character Duffy decides to take credit for the devils work as long as she can tell him his name in three years time. I won't ruin the end of the book for you, but it is important to know that doing things yourself isn't a bad idea. This book is also an easy read for children."
2,Concise and useful,"You will actually build a web site using DW 8 and Fireworks 8 and Flash. This book , although it has few errors, is a very good and through intro to web creation.Fuddzie"
2,Too many errors,"There are tons of errors in the book. From the simple -- giving the wrong information to input -- to the inexcusable -- providing a CD with tutorials that don't have the same information as the tutorials in the book. How are we supposed to learn a program if we can't depend on the information from either source provided?Do these books have editors and fact checkers? Assuming they do, shouldn't the priority be on getting the information in the book perfect?Having said that, I have run into this problem before with books of this type. They try to rush them into the bookstores to get the first-mover advantage with not much regard for the accuracy of the information contained in them. In all honesty, I've seen worse examples of this than the Studio 8 book.If you're a true beginner, I can't recommend this book because you'll never know if you're doing something wrong or if the information in the book or on the CD is wrong."
3,Suite Integration,"The tutorials covers the basic tools and techniques available in Fireworks, Dreamweaver and Flash. Great book to get a jump-start on Studio 8.The book was easy to follow and provides sufficient graphics to understand tedious procedures. This book is good for someone that is completely new Macromedia software."
2,"Starts off strong, but finishes weak","First off, let me say that I don't normally do these reviews, but for this book I had to say something.Within the first few pages, you will find two issues. The first is this book still talks about Freehand, which no longer ships in the studio package, BTW. The second is a incorrect instruction, which if not found, will mess up the first lesson. In general, you can usually figure out the problems, but not aways.And that is the second major issue with this book. There are no updates to this book. If its broke, and you can't figure it out, tough luck.In conclusion, the book does do a good job of explaining workflow within the suite, but sometimes it is just way too off (particularity in the second half of the book) for anyone who is a true beginner."
3,I expected it should be better...,"In Special Edition Using Storage Area Networks does not give us clear examples how to use SANs. Also, it just mentioned the companies have such storage hardware and software but didn't point out which companies' products and how to we could use them.After reading the book, you may get the sense about SANs but not practical. If you are looking for some book to help you to setup SANs, definely you should go to others."
2,Not an efficient backpack,"I am a college students who purchased this book bag to protect my laptop in and to be able to carry books around. Well lets just say that if you just wanted to carry your laptop around then you would be fine, but other than that you would not be able to carry anything else in it except for maybe a notebook. Though it is well padded. Also. I have a 15.4"" wide screen Sony Vaio and it fits perfectly well with a sleeve around it in the backpack itself."
4,A GOOD READ!,"What a lucky guy David Nathan is! He's had the good fortune of exploring the lives of some of the greatest performers of all time! This book is enjoyable and definitely a page-turner! I especially enjoyed the chapter on Nathan's obvious favorite, Dionne Warwick, because it allowed a rare glimpse in to the life of a very private superstar. The last chapter on the three ""new"" divas would have been better left out, and replaced with another chapter on a lady that Nathan is more familiar with, as it suffers from a lack of detail. Also, a better editor would not have let some of the typographical errors pass - as well as a couple of incorrect dates. For those problems, I deduct one star. But regardless, it is a great book and a rare gem!"
4,"colorful, quality puzzle for 8-9 year old","this 200 piece puzzle is the correct level of difficulty for my 8 year old, who is adept at jigsaw puzzles. it is more colorful, and the cardboard is better quality, with a glossy finish, than some cheaper puzzles. the pieces are about 1 inch in size."
3,"Did not have quality problems, but be warned -- these are a big step up from 100 pc puzzles","I did not have the quality issues that others have had with these puzzles. The quality of the image and pieces was quite good.However, I must warn you that these are a material step up in difficulty from the Melissa & Doug 100-piece puzzles. My 7-year old twins breezed through the 100-piecers but were pretty frustrated with getting these puzzles together and eventually needed a lot of help.I'm not sure if there are puzzles in between 100 and 200, but be aware that these could be frustrating for 7-8 year old tweeners."
2,"Tsk, Tsk","First of all there is no such word in Websters and I do agree with some of the other reviewers. I did read Blindsighted and found much repeated word for word from that. The people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information. When the doc hears something, she doesn't know what they are talking about as no information was given her by the detectives. After all she was at the scene of most the crimes and should have been given a better handle on it. Then I hate the way the perps get away with stuff right under the noses of the surveilance. This author sure leaves you dangling."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I had high hopes for this book. Karin Slaughter has been annointed the ""Next Thomas Harris"" and the ""Next Patricia Cornwell"". After reading both this book and her first outing, I can definitely say I agree.She incorporates all of the grisly titillation of Harris, without his research and depth of characterization. She has the same facile writing style and preposterous abuses of procedure that embody the last 3 outings of Cornwell.The book does propell the reader through with sparse prose, and that is a definite skill. As other reviewers have mentioned, however, the characterizations are facile and lack of in depth research is very apparent.Some research online reveals that several of the 5 star reviews of this book are written by the author's agent, publisher and bookseller friends."
1,"Very, very, very over-touted work","While Blindsighted showed some promise, Slaughter's follow-up book loses points. She makes a number of mistakes. First, there's far too much time spent on truly unlikeable characters. Second, the two protagonists are cardboard cutouts. No? Try imagining them as friends for a minute ... Couldn't happen, as there's just not enough substance. Third, there's too little action and too much character background, one inner conflict after another, *endless* self-questioning, which is meant to show their depth I guess but only makes them look weak and unsure. Forth, I had A LOT of problems with sloppy, unrealistic procedures, as though the town wasn't staffed by professionals but was using the butcher to sub as the sheriff and the local school teacher as the doctor. Finally, a lot of the dialogue seemed forced, and some actually made me cringe.I'm not sure I'd even buy the paperback on this one."
1,What's all the fuss?,"I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend whose taste I normally trust. However, just one chapter into this book I knew I was wasting my time. The writing is unremarkable, the characters patently unbelievable and unsympathetic and the plot unfocused. I was not put off by the violent subject so much as the writer's inability to make me care about the three protagonists. (And splitting the reader's attention among three main characters is another of this book's weaknesses.) I understand this is the second in a series. I have no desire to go back and read the first, let alone will I waste time with these three losers in the future."
1,Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery -- NOT here!,"As much as I want to like Slaughter, I just can't get into her books. The subject, while relevant, has been covered before and much better -- see ANYTHING by Andrew Vachss, especially the BURKE novels. The ""medical-examiner"" chic prose has been done before, and better -- see the ""Scarpetta"" novels, by Patricia Cornwell. And the characters are too unbelievable and coarsely drawn to inspire any emotion for them.The character dialogue and interaction seems stiff, as evidenced in the excerpt posted here. And the ""graphic detail"" often touted in ""reviews"" seems to be borderline gratuitous. Slaughter has no credentials in forensics or law enforcement and this book highlights those deficiencies.The reviewers that have compared her to Cornwell, Vachss, and Reichs do those three authors a major disservice. Imitation may be ""the sincerest form of flattery"" but not in this case."
2,I Have Finally Found a Book I Don't Want Read to Me,"This is in reference to the unabridged version. The reader uses what was probably intended to be a Georgia accent. I don't know if she knows what one sounds like but it watered down by a producer or she actually thinks that this was a Georgia accent-- but whatever the cause, this was BAD. I was gritting my teeth over the narrator's nasal voice within the first five minutes. Within the next five I was praying that someone would get killed so I didn't have to hear any more about the heroine's relationship with her ex-husband as they groped one another in a crowded skating rink. Finally, I gave it up as a bad job.I am left with only one burning question-- now mind I make no claim to being able to wear Cinderella's glass slipper myself-- but how big are the heroine's feet and why did she have to wear men's skates?"
2,RELIGIOUS READERS BEWARE,"The auther, Karin Slaughter, hates Christians. Her first novel revolved around a serial killer who was a religous fanatic. Her second featured a Christian minister participating in child molesting. The only character Slaughter pictures as a living saint is a blind lesbian. Her romantic lead cheats on his wife."
1,Reading This is an Effective Form of Torture,"Where to begin? There is no significant character development. As soon as you are getting to know a character, the perspective will switch to one of the other many, many characters. However, this could be a blessing-- considering that all of the characters are infinitely boring, unlikeable and depressing anyway.This dreck was so INCREDIBLY BORING that I began skimming about half way though. And then I just gave up and skipped to the end.This book was so horribly dull, I just had to see if the author could salvage it with an unexpected, creative conclusion. No such luck. The author tries to push the envelope and go for shock value...but fails miserably. Instead, the ending was...well, just plain gross and stupid.Save your money and bang your head repeatedly into a brick wall, instead of purchasing this boring dreck. You will achieve the same feeling as if you just read the entire book."
1,Why write this?,"This is not the first book I read by Slaughter. Right now, I do not want to read another. I want to be entertained, not repulsed. I don't want to read about child porn or child sex abuse in my free time. It was graphic at times. If you want to write about sex, how about the main characters instead?"
4,absorbing mystery,"It's hard for me to say much about this book without sounding ike the dust jacket or giving away the plot. The Characters from Blindsighted are back, picking up where we left off. I loved the writing -- the characters really felt alive to me, and the plot pulled me forward so that I finished the book in an afternoon. My only reservation is that, looking backwards from the resolution, some of the plot elements seemed not to make as much sense as I would like. I would, nevertheless, highly recommend this book."
5,Thrilling read,"I have exhausted my stash of Cornwell and Reichs and also Sue Grafton and was looking for a new thriller / detective novel. I picked this up on holiday and couldn't put it down. So much so that I went to the airport book shop on the way home to see if I could purchase anymore of her work, and was not dissapointed with ""A Faint Cold Fear"" - that was equally enthralling. I highly reccommend, a very good read."
4,none,Love the character building that takes place in Slaughter's books. She also does very well with blood and gore - as well as the drama.
5,Kisscut,"I have read eleven of the twelve books written by Karin Slaughter. There has not been one that I have not enjoyed immensely. I love her style of writing and find it to be open, original and very easy on the mind since this is the way that my thought processes would describe the different situations that arise. There is no repetitive theme that one finds with some authors where you almost know what is going to happen next. I love the interaction between the regular cast of characters as well as new ones introduced with every book. There is a good balance between involvement of the cast with each other while all are playing a part in the murders and mysteries that are unfolding. Karin, I hope you keep writing because I am just going to have to reread all of your books at some stage while waiting for the next to come out."
4,Love Slaughter!,Another great book by KS! Would like to see more out of her soon! She is great at developing her story lines
4,Kisscut,I am really enjoying this new (to me) author. She is a very easy fast read. Grossly accurate with griping personal drama.
3,A Hypnotic Story,"Are you a strong reader? I mean can you take anything in a book? Prepare yourself for this one. KISSCUT has a very dark theme, but a very hypnotic story.When Jeffrey Tolliver is forced to shoot a teenage girl who is pointing a gun at a teenage boy, all hell breaks loose in Grant County. The local sheriff has his hands full with his emotional turmoil, but that is nothing compared to the upheaval as a town's dark secret is brought to the surface.Karin Slaughter is an excellent storyteller. I will admit I did not enjoy this book as much as the first book in the series, but that may have more to do with the theme of the story. She holds all the twists and complications together, but I will admit to being disappointed in the resolution.A good read and strong enough to make me want to read the next in the series."
4,Sinister Suspense,"The rough and raw realm of child pornography is the background for this the sinister KISSCUT of Karen Slaughter's second story in the lives of small town residents in Georgia. Slaughter spares no punches with graphic detail as police chief, Jeffery Tolliver and his ex-wife Sara, the county medical examiner follow a trail of frustrating leads, which destroys the maniac's path.To save a life Jeffery must take the life of a young girl, which will forever haunt him. This is a page turner you are reluctant to advance to the next page as the pace never relents.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,absorbing and well written,"One of the best authors I've read in years. Totally intriguing. The problems of the characters make them more real. Bad things really to happen to good people. Maybe so many bad thins does push it a bit, but the characters careers and personalities make them high risk and in the line of fire. Her books are best enjoyed if read in sequence. I love all the characters, feast on every detail of their lives, the plots are awesome, yes graphic, shocking at times and horrific, but that is the whole point of crime thrillers! I will read every book she writes and eagerly and impatiently await the next. I can't recommend this author enough."
4,Edgy crime drama with human side,Karin Slaughter has yet again hit a good balance of murder mystery intrigue and underlying human relationships. Enjoyable.
3,The plot is good... the sequel is bad,"The stories of pedophiles and child molesters are ugly and very difficult to write and keep the reader interested in the story and not only thinking dire things about the abductors. That part of the book is very good as KS explains all that happened to the kids. But the first third of the book is boring because it explains lamely what happened in the first book ""Blindsighted"". Nevertheless you must read the first book to understand this one, and the gist of writing sequel books is that you must understand the second or third book without reading the first one. To do that you must write in the sequel just enough information of the previous books. This book has many things about the first one but it never explains anything, so if you already read ""Blindsighted"" you will bore reading the first pages of the book, but if you didn't read it you won't understand anything.If you want to read more of this kind of plot read ""Out of Reach"" by Patricia Lewin."
4,Classic Slaughter..........shocking and graphic,"Kisscut is a shocking and graphic story that is classic Karin Slaughter. Slaughter pulls no punches and spares no emotion!When a young girl is shot and killed, when the body of an unborn infant is discovered, when all around close ranks and no one knows who is to blame or why...... the story is just beginning!The slow revelation of the truth is shadowed by deceit, self mutilation, child abuse and a denial of basic concepts of trust and love.The final chapters will leave you horrified and stunned, and in light of the recent kidnappings and murders of young girls in Florida, you will realize that Karin Slaughter's message is real and has deadly consequences."
4,An enjoyable read,"An enjoyable read and I enjoyed the book, I'll read more of her books when ever I get the chance."
4,Edge of your seat kinda book,Didn't want to put it down once I started. Getting ready to start on blindsided nextHope it's as exciting.
5,"Different, Excellent","I read a lot of this kind of novel and when I saw this one, I read the plot line and added it to the pile. I'm delighted to say that this one is very different. Although I clearly missed a LOT in not reading her first novel, I found that I was unable to figure out even slightly where this one was going. I can usually figure out where and who most novels are going for miles in advance (don't even mention T.V). I just wanted to say that this writer, although the writing is a little choppy(Not always an authors fault, by the way), it's a book to be proud of and I really enjoyed it. If you're bored with the usual, this has the definite quality of something different."
4,Intriguing,Loved the book. I feel like I know all the characters. Can't wait for the next book.Thank you very much
2,Good story,"Her writing is disjointed and awkward at times, but she comes up with an interesting plot that moves at a good pace."
1,Don't waste your $5,This is the most worthless piece of fecal matter I have ever bought. Nothing functions well. It's like reading a bad book. No interactive elements. Totally Sucks.
5,Quality Replacement,"I bought one of these several months ago, and it has performed admirably. It's just as good as my original battery when it was new."
3,A Timeless Film - Ignored by many and under rated,"A delightful film! Anthony Edwards is supported by a tremendous cast of characters including Robert Mitchum, Mary Stuart Masterson, Anjelica Huston, Lauren Bacall, Harry Dean Stanton, and Virgina Madsen. Based on a novel by Thornton Wilder and directed by Danny Huston, the film, filmed on location in Newport, Rhode Island, captures the charm and innocence of the 1920s. Anthony Edwards carries this film and makes the film, which would otherwise be simply mediocre, come to life. A charming film well worth watching."
4,A Great Movie!,"With Anthony Edwerds as Mr. North, Robert Mitchum as James Bosworth, Lauren Bacall as Amilia Crinston and Anjelica Huston as Persis Bosworth-Tennyson you realy can't go rong. A great movie, the only thing that kept it from the fifth star is how Persis ran of with Mr. North almost at first glance. It's basicly about this guy, Mr. North, and what he does with the electricty he stores in his body. It is also about who hates him because of it. With great acting by Robert Mitchum, Lauren Bacall and Anjelica Huston, don't pass this one up.- An Anjelica Huston Fan"
3,Not really for kids,"For the most part, this is a cute movie. However, if you kids old enough to catch certain actions and language [mine are 10 & 12] - this isn't for them. There are a couple of scenes and lines that caught us off guard!"
3,Mr. North on DVD,"I feel like the Debbie-Downer at this party. I enjoyed the movie for what it was: a feel-good, high comedy - and I do think Anthony Edwards did a very admirable job. However, having read Thorton Wilder's book first, it cannot compare. I think the most thought-provoking situations - and some very important characters - were left out. I also felt the emphasis on the ""magic"" took away from the more profound meaning conveyed in the book. I wonder if the other reviewers read the book and, again, I probably would have a more favorable view of it had I not. It's cliche to say the book is better than the movie but in this case that is most certainly the case. For those who enthusiatically enjoyed the movie, I encourage you to read Mr. Wilder's wonderful and delighful book."
2,Not a keeper,"Suzanne Robinson has written some good books, but this is not one of them. The major characters lack depth and definition and the plot is predictable. I was disappointed."
1,The old Bate and Switch,"This company bates you with the nicer badge with the color seal and a good price, but sends you the cheaper Blackington J306 model badge. You really read the fine print with these folks.Both are good badges but the price you pay is higher then the list rate for what you get."
3,Not as helpful as I hoped,I purchased this to help prepare for a backpack trip in KK/Sequoia where I will enter from the East (Onion Valley). This book is of no use for this trip. There are only several pages that cover the east side and the information in them is minimal. This book would be good as a light hiking reference for people driving and day hiking from the road running in from the West. There are no GPS coordinates and the maps are quite basic.
5,Terrific product - hard plastic model,I like this product better than the new bjorn bibs that are made of softer plastic. This bib is sturdy and catches all the food very well. The yellow color is especially nice because my child can see the food that she dropped against the yellow backdrop easier than she would against the red or the blue bibs. Just a terrific product. This product didn't fit her neck when she was younger because she was so chunky but after she was 12 months old it fit her very well because she thinned out. Enjoy!
5,Totally FAB BIB!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the best on the market...BUY it now, other bibs just pale in comparison!"
3,Good Coverage,I love the idea of this but unfortunately my grandson hates it. Its too hard and rubs his neck.
2,NOTHING NEW IN THIS BOOK,"I've read almost every book ever written about Diana. This contains no new information. It is the standard stuff-how Prince Charles cheated on her, how she had affairs with James Hewitt, Hasnat Khan, Dodi Fayed. I've read it all before. The only thing that I found interesting is how Andrew Morton portrays Diana's butler, Paul Burrell, who wrote ""A Royal Duty."" He makes several unflattering comments about the butler and in so many words, accuses him of lying about many things. We will never know the real truth about Diana."
2,"Same old, same old","Morton has nothing new in this book.. He mentions his first book about Diana about 10,000 times during the read. It is the same old, same old. If you have read the butler's book and all the other books writen about this woman over the years what could anyone write that would be earth shaking new?I think he must need money. Why else would he write such a lame book!"
2,Not from a Christian perspective,"I purchased this book to give my children a good idea of Bible time geography and what I received was some interesting facts about the Holy lands mixed in with poor theology and a lack of Bible knowledge. The author includes references to ""10 million"" years ago as well as presenting a God who had to send plagues on Egypt to get Pharaoh to let God's people go (no mention of God hardening Pharaoh's heart). If there would have been color pictures (like his book for adults), I could have edited the content and still received what I was looking for. However, the line drawings - as interesting as they are - don't make the information any clearer. If you're looking for a book that esteems the authority of the Bible, this is not the book for you."
2,Could have been so much better,"I loved the idea of this book. I really disliked the execution.He didn't walk the bible. He didn't tell me anything I didn't know. And he didn't write this for kids. He wrote a big book and thought if I pare it down, I can sell it again for more money.I agree with the photos -- bad quality. And I really didn't care about all the problems he ran into. Describe to me what I cannot see myself.Don't waste your time on this."
2,Dating system used is BCE. Says it all.,"Dating system used is BCE. This was a huge turn off to me. I'm tired of agendas and political correctness. Given the title and subject matter, I expected something else. This is a personal bias. You might enjoy the book."
3,Suitable for Older Students,"Purchased as gift for third grader. He did not carefor it. Lack of colorful maps and few photos made it not interesting; however, older student might enjoy it."
5,Wonderful,"I abolutely like this movie, because I dont see it as a ""last film from C.C."" I see it as it is, a good comedy, especiallybecause Loren an Brando do not have the greatest chemestry - itmakes it even funnier. I like the type of comedy from these daysand it cant be compared to our times - I judge it positively for a movie from these days. Love it much!"
2,This is the Chaplin film to avoid....,"This film is not without some merit, but overall, it's pretty disappointing, considering it's a Charlie Chaplin film. Out of Chaplin's five sound films, this is the one to avoid. It seems Mr. Chaplin was trying to put Marlon Brando in a role Chaplin himself would have performed in his heyday. But Chaplin was obviously too old to play the tramp (he was 77 when he made this), so he put Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren through the antics. There are a few funny moments, a lot of doors slamming, some nice humanistic touches, but most of it just seems tired. The supporting performances are very subpar, the editing is quite awkward, and the atmosphere of the film is almost dirge like. A rather sad experience, especially if you're a Chaplin fan. It's not the worst film ever made, but it's very disappointing...."
2,disappointed,"i was attracted by HongKong set ,the cast and the director.HongKong setting lasts two frames at the beginning of the film and then disappeared. Sophia loren plays modestly . Chaplin directs this movie as Charlot's movie . Boring ."
1,DEFECTIVE ITEM,"I am VERY UNHAPPY with spending the money on the CD. It is defective and just stops in several places, each time for a few minutes. And some of the best scenes have been edited out. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY. I will tell everyone I know that if they are thinking of ordering anything from AMAZON, to be careful."
2,Another review,"I see there's several reviews already for this film, but here goes my two cents worth. Even though this is Chaplin's last film, it's his first and only film in color and widescreen. The movie is old fashion to say the least, it might of been better in b/w. Brando and Loren are completely wasted, the supporting players fair much better. Chaplin is quite good in his cameo role (makes you wish he'd given himself a bigger part). At the time, Chaplin took the negative reviews as almost a personal threat. He really defended the film, even going so far as to say he thought it was the best film he ever made! However several years later he admitted it wasn't very good, he said the actors where great but the story was really thin."
3,A boring (and bored) performance by Brando!,"First of all, I love Brando, love Sophia Loren. I saw this in the theaters when it first came out and I wanted to own it. It wasn't so much that this is a good movie; it's just entertainingly bad. The editing is choppy, the actors move around like they are pieces being placed on a chess board, Brando is obviously BORED and he looks as though he over-acts on purpose in some of the scenes. The extras are AWFUL...the whole movie has an out-of-date feel to it (and not in a good way). There is NO sexual tension between 2 of the sexiest movie stars ever. So, what do I like about it? The absolutely gorgeous love theme ""This is my song', watching Sophia Loren's luminous eyes fill with tears, and Marlon Brando doing a semi-tango at the end (although he messes up at one point...watch closely). Yeah, I bought it, still watch it...it is one of my favorite bad movies."
4,Beat '94,"This is a wailer, deserving high volume listening, in both senses. It's NOT ambient noise--it wants the front and center treatment, mixing free drumming with guitar plonking to lay down a base for some beat rhyming from Ranaldo and Hooker. Turn it up and pay attention, and imagine yourself there."
3,"First, but not the best, however...","West of the Sun was Pangborn's first novel, published in 1953. While it is not his best (that would come with his second, the International Fantasy Award-winning A Mirror for Observers) it does end on such a poignant and hopeful note that the reader is left with many profound thoughts on which to ponder. The story revolves around six U. S. astronauts stranded on the far planet of Lucifer, and they must survive and cope with not only each other but also with that planet's two native sentient species. Many years later, when a rescue ship finally arrives, they decide to remain to continue developing their thriving society. This reissue is from Old Earth Books, and it is their intention to follow-up with all of Pangborn's titles in uniform editions. It is extremely encouraging that there is renewed interest in this excellent but sadly neglected writer."
3,Bronson searches for a mass murderer.,"An investigative reporter (Charles Bronson) tries to unravel the mystery behind the assassintation of an entire Mormon family. An above average murder mystery with action scenes, Messenger of Death is flawed only by an ending so abrupt it's nearly comical. Still I recommend it to the former action superstar's fans."
1,Caligari?,I'm confused. The music on this CD is not that of THE CABINET OF DOCTOR CALIGARI. Is it the 60's remake music? I was expecting the old sinister organ tunes but instead I got these jazz sounds. Damn!
5,Great Product,The mat is soft and beautiful. It includes a nice carry bag and relaxing mini disc. I bought it as a gift with great success.
4,Very nice yoga mat,"This yoga mat is very pretty but has the designer logo in the design so I feel like a billboard at yoga class. Otherwise very nice, the painted on design I can notice sometimes but in general blends in with the mat nicely. I recommend it if this is in your budget.The beauty in the mat inspires me in my yoga practice."
5,Beautiful mat,"This mat is really pretty, actually it was hard to decide, because all of the designs are so beautiful. Is thick enough and the mesh bag is just perfect to carry it."
3,Not very fun!,"My dad took me to Toys R Us because I saw the 5sies on TV, and I really wanted to get them. After I brought them home, I realized I should've gotten something else. When I played with them their booties fell off easily. The little booties don't fit - they're too small! When I tried to take off their clothes to change their outfit, it was almost impossible to do (especially when you try to take off their diapers)! It's not really educational at all because there's not a mom, nor a dad to be able to have a whole family to play with (Unless you use a Barbie doll). I would suggest older kids not get the 5sies dolls because they become very boring to play with after a while. Buy something that's actually FUN."
5,Fantastic songs...,"This CD has, other than the title track, Spaceman, Diamond Rib Cage, and Think About Your Troubles. Spaceman is one of my favorite belly songs, it's sorta eerie, and has classic Tanya Donelly lyrics. Think About Your Troubles (a cover of a Nilsson song) is great too. Diamond Rib Cage isn't bad, but it's not quite up there with Spaceman.This is one of the best belly singles (in my opinion anyway), along with Now They'll Sleep. I think some of Belly's best music is on the singles, not the albums. But it's all good music."
1,"Hear, no see","If you are content with closing your eyes and listen, it would be 3 star. If you insist on watching, it is zero star. Ooops, I mean one star.The whole dvd is far too dark. Save your money for the dvd with Kate Aldrich. You will know why, when you watch her. That dvd is zero risk."
3,Chaos....,"The manga that started the anime. So if you have the anime you may wish to skip this book. On the other hand it is cheaper than the anime by a long shot. And confusion rules the pages of this book Yes, sometimes chaos can be lovely. And sometimes it is just chaos, ugly and confusing, hard to understand. No matter how hard you stare at the pages."
4,"It's good, I suppose","It's so nutritious, and you get used to the taste after a while, so that doesn't matter that much. Don't get vanilla, that tastes like a cup of nastiness."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I ordered both the chocolate & vanilla. I just assumed the chocolate would be the one I'd prefer. I totally agree with theprevious ""reviewers"" that it's not that good. The vanilla is quite good & I'd advise buying it before trying the chocolate. I find that the chocolate doesn't blend up as smooth as the vanilla."
5,Pleased,"We are very pleased with the quality and taste of this product. Pharmacist have suggested other high protein shakes, we have tried them and found them all to be inferior to Carb Solutions. Our only regret is that it is so hard to find."
5,How I Prepare My Shakes,"I suffer from fibromyalgia, hypoglycemia, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue, so I really need a shake that is packed with protein and nutrition. Since I have been low carbing for over two years now, I naturally get cravings at night but also use the mix as my breakfast pick me up before work. Here is how I prepare it, and it is wonderful! Note that I pour it into an icy plastic mug (I keep several in the freezer) and let it sit in the freezer for a few minutes vs. adding the ice, which tends to water it down and take away the thickness. Simply pour your 8 oz of water (or sometimes I use 6 oz of water and 2 oz of the Carb Countdown skim milk or heavy cream, or all 8 oz Carb Countdown milk)INTO A BLENDER BEFORE ADDING THE POWDER and blend. When this combo has blended, add 2-3 tablespoons of peanut butter (I use the Carb Options brand) and blend again. I think it's wonderful this way."
4,Great Shake if Prepared right,"I have been using these shakes for about two weeks now and have been experimenting with different ways to prepare it. This shake can really taste great and still be low carb if prepared right. Here is how I prepare it:Put the following items in blender in this order:2T of heavy cream1/4 cup crushed iceWater to fill to 1c. mark on your blender1/2 t of vanilla2 scoops of mixpulse blend to crush ice, then use spatula to scrape off unmixed mix on sides. Then put blender on full power for 30 sec to a minute.Now you have a thick satisfying shake that tastes good and is around 200 calories, with very low carbs.My only complaint about these shakes is that it says on the label that there are around 13 servings, I have gone through two canisters and both had only 11 servings."
1,Please don't waste your hard earned cash on this icky stuff!,"I found this stuff to be seriously nasty - both in chocolate and vanilla. Nothing I've done has improved the flavor or terrible texture. I've tried mixing it in a shaker (too much sludge at the bottom that doesn't mix in no matter what), using my blender with crushed ice (still ick) and even in my blender with ice and various fresh fruits, as well as an extra packet or two of sweetener and even some various flavored extracts to boost the flavor. It was still seriously nasty. I took this product on vacation, thinking that it would be easier to pack (and it was - I used big ziplock storage baggies) than the delightful prepared SlimFast meal drink I'm used to. What a huge disappointment. Spend the extra and get the SlimFast Meal drink.Now the big question is - what do I do with the four canisters that I've already spent nearly $50 to purchase?????"

5,A great gift,This is among the nicest gifts to give to a coach. This whistle was presented at our banquet to a fellow coach who was retiring from coaching after decades of coaching. Bonus here is that the thunderer is the best whistle around and he is going to become an official.
4,Arrows for Christmas gift,Jr High Nephew was into archery and needed arrows. Could not find inexpensive ones in store and found this on Amazon. Exactly what we wanted.
2,Not as good as I thought,"This movie was not as well acted as i thought it would be. The story line needed more to it and the actor's seemed like they did not know what they were doing. I did not like this movie very much. I thought; as i had seen Kerry Washington in ""Save the Last Dance"" that the movie would be better as i think that she is a good acctress; however, i was dissapointed."
1,boring...........,"This movie gives a good look at what its like in the modern-day ghetto, but honestly, it lacked the common-threads of a good picture. Half way through, I wasn't even sure what the plot was. It shifted gears way too much and I couldn't follow whether it was this guy or that guy who knocked which girl up."
4,The Lives of the Saints,"It's great Italian story by great aitalian actress Sopia Loren and talented too, a woman of passionate love of life and family. She dominates the picture as well she should because it is her talent as an actress and her incredible personality that brought her to this point in her career. Her dramatic turns and use of Italian gestures turn this into a joyous romp for both her and the audience."
3,Missed Something?,"Being a big fan of Sophia Loren, ordered many of her movies. Love her acting ability, but just didn't get it. Have to watch it again, and maybe again after that. Something is off, either the movie or myself lol."
1,received wrong item,"I did not receive the item I ordered. The online photo of the product box showed the correct item, but it was not the one I received. When I called to tell them I received the wrong item, they only offered to send me a return address label. No apology and no offer to replace with the correct item."
5,free-form fun,"This is a wonderful book with no words but excellent illustrations. The pictures follow a garden gnome though his day of being dragged around by a little girl. He gets a bath in the bird bath and put in a pink frilly dress, among other things. Then at night, he comes to life and helps to take care of the garden and the little girl. He brings back her teddy, which she lost in the garden. There are a ton of little things to find on each page; the one I remember best is a little worm. The kids I ""read"" this with love to point out the ""wormie."" It's also nice to be able to make up your own story to go with the pictures. It's a great book."
2,Garden Gnome will kill you in your sleep! (with a rake),"I came across this book at ... and could not pass up the opportunity! It was the perfect Christmas gag gift for my sister, complete with a stalker garden gnome wielding a deadly rake. It's the creepiest book I have ever seen and I can't believe someone would read this to their young child, or pay more than a dollar for it. Especially creepy is the picture of the gnome staring at the little girl from outside her window. Oh, and when he rises from the grave. That's scary too."
2,Very Disappointing Product!,"These CDs are fine and play properly. Alas, the source recording is defective! Did the manufacturer do it on purpose to reduce the number of CDs it took to produce the item? Did the BBC provide the manufacturer with a defective source product? Who knows? In any event, in this product, small amounts of the radio program are SKIPPED very frequently, Not just on one disk, not just on rare occasions, but almost continually, and on all the disks. A person who did not already know this story well would be thoroughly confused and certainly disappointed. What a shame! As a representation of one of the world's most beloved works of literature, this product is unacceptable. I'm so glad this item is out-of-print. I hope it stays that way."
4,Love these guys,"Have to give it up to SOG's, they rock and really do play anywhere at anytime.They are awesome live! What you hear on the cd is what you get live, I really respect that, who else hates a bad live band?Where Do I Go got most of the pub as far as radio playtime, but I personally feel Flee is their best song from this cd."
3,It's Not Alright...,"I always enjoy Larry Collins' books. This one may be the best yet. He weaves facts with could-be-facts, and makes a cogent argument for the illegal drug trade being the source of terrorists' funding. Throw in some high-tech gizmos, and you have a good thriller. He's a good storyteller. But.................For some reason, he keeps writing ""all right"" as ""alright"". I don't remember this quirk in his other works, so maybe his editor is on vacation. Such a small thing becomes a large distraction when repeated hundreds of times in a story. I hope it's corrected in subsequent editions............................."
3,Some interesting facts...,"carry the readers interest. The author has been doing this for a long time and knows how to turn the pages. But the ending is a big let down, realistic, perhaps, but a disappointment nonetheless. The facts are scary enough to make it a worthwhile read."
4,A book which both entertains and educates you.,This book is a thriller which describes how money received from trafficking heroin could be used by terrorists to aquire weapons to carry out attacks. the author spends a lot of time describing the various tactics used by the terrorists and the police to outwit each other.Actually this part of the book is the only minor flaw as the story gets a bit bogged down in the middle as the authour describes in great detail how the heroin trade works in the Middle East.The last third of this book is very exiting.Overall the book is both exiting and informative.
3,chunky savory,"looks better on display than on foot... the Tsubo brand is over hyped, it is not as comfortable as the fairy tale description."
2,"In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king","Only I am not sure that Christian Thielemann has even one eye. This painfully dull performance of the ""Faust"" Symphony, with slack climaxes and sluggish tempi, receives two stars only because video recordings of Liszt's orchestral masterpiece (NOT ""the"" masterpiece; it's one among many) are such a rarity, because the quality of the sound and the picture is tolerably high, because Thielemann's moronic physiognomy is rather amusing, and because I am in a fairly good mood. But the truth is that I have tried to watch it three times - and I have seen all of it but once. Visually it's a great improvement overDG's hilariously ugly DVDof Bernstein with the BSO from 1976. Musically Thielemann's sedated ""interpretation"" is light years behind Bernstein's rendition (which is no great shakes in the first place). Small wonder that Liszt's orchestral music is still grossly underappreciated. It will remain so until it is so hideously performed."
4,When you don't want anyone to know how much you've poured in your glass,"I have collected black matte dishes for years and thought what better accessory than black glasses. My husband has an old chalice shaped wine glass that he uses every night and I thought this would be a good alternative for those times I managed to get the other one in the dishwasher. Alas, not only can't fellow dinner mates see how much wine you are drinking, it is very difficult for the pourer to see when he/she is approaching the rim. Nonetheless, my son liked it so much, I ordered one for him as well."
3,XS650 Performance Review,VERY informative book on the history of the XS650. Lots of details and information I was unaware of. Covers all the years of this fine motorcycle.
2,Let Sarah Speak,"After reading 220 pages of one women's thoughts about her husband, her mother, her father, herself and the negroes they own as property, I'm exhausted. Its not that the book ""Property"" doesn't have lots of potential, it just seems to get caught inside a stuffy house and is never given a chance to run loose and free in the meadow.If a writer is going to use primarily one voice to tell a memoir style story, best give the voice to a person an audience wants to hear tell it. What I wanted most by the end of this book was for that primary voice to just shut up and let someone else tell the story. Someone with a real story to tell. Its tiring to always read how someone felt about others actions. I'd rather be told how they reacted to others. ""Property"" lacked the vibrant action that its premise suggested.Maybe a different style of writing would've made it more interesting and believable. Then again, maybe not!"
1,Boring,This book was boring from the beginning to the end.. I agree with some of the other readers who gave this book one star.
1,Harlaqin Laced Period Piece,"As I started the book it was not particularly interesting at all to me, although I'm rather fond of period pieces. I continued on and soonlost interest when I realized that this book contained overt detailed descriptions of the acts between the female slave owner and her female slave.Naturally in any slave story there is expected to be reference to some kind of non consenting relationship in most cases. However,this book appeared to be going down the path of a Harlaqin Love Novel in it's detail of such acts and that is not what I was looking for in a period piece at all. That aside the book does highlight a different aspect of slavery ownership, and the whole degrading and demoralizing institution of slavery and how it affects the minds of the oppressed."
4,Interesting Read,Property was a very fascinating read. Reading this novel puts you inside the minds of slaves and their owners. This was my very first time reading anything by Valerie Martin. She has a very unique writing style.
3,Have read much better,"I thought this book was okay at best. Not really heart warming and not heart wrenching. It did not move me in the slightest. The story would have been more captivating if there truly was some sort of friendship between the two female protagonists. Instead it was fluffy. Read something else along the same genre, you could fare no worse really."
3,Bizarre Ending,"This is a meandering tale of Manon, a River Road plantation owner's wife, whom essentially hates everything about her life. From the way her husband handles the slaves, to his bizarre games with the slaves, to his attentions towards the house slave Sarah - she cannot stand her husband nor life at the plantation. Eventually in one night everything comes to a head and life is never the same for Manon.This story was captivating but there are a lot of things to the story that really have nothing to do with the story as a whole and you have to wonder why the author included them. The ending is bizarre and sudden. Had this novel been a bit more flushed out I think it would be a great work."
2,What is all the hype about?,"I read this book in two evenings. This book is based on some interesting ideas but the writer does not develop them very well. I felt half-dead reading the book because I didn't care about any of the characters and it didn't matter much what happened to them . The book is an ok read at best. I think that everyone is so enthralled by the author's somewhat fresh approach to a grim subject, they are willing to overlook the fact that the book's structure is on the weak side."
2,poor read,I am an avid reader and this book was very hard to follow and a little confusing. why was Mistress taking breat milk as a way to ease her pain? I was not happy with this read at all
3,just ok,"The book was well written, amusing at times..but was not what I expected the plot to be. The plot is really centered around one character, the wife of a plantation owner. If given a choice again I would not purchase."
4,A great short read...,"I can understand the reviewer from MD feeling frustrated by the main character, but I think is a result of the writers ability to convey the alien emotions of slavery. What can be more frustrating than a character and a society willing to employ considerable intellect to ensure mutual spiritual destruction?"
4,Very Interesting,I finnished the book very quickly. The author gave an intriguing disturbed story narrated from the wife of the master. I didnt like Manon but I did notice that she was very inteligent and intuitive. She also was independant for that time period. Now with writing this I also say she was cruel and I believe had homoerotic feelings for Sarah. In a sense the book ended better then it started though for both women. The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is I hated the ending.
3,"Blah, blah, blasé...","I bought the book and read in one day. I have to say I wasn't very impressed by it and disappointed greatly especially after hearing an enthralling review of it on NPR. When I finished it, I didn't know if I was supposed to feel sympathetic for any of the characters in this book. I still don't know what to make of it. Maybe I missed something? The main character, Manon, is one you'll love to hate! I found her to be a petty, jealous, embittered and sexually frustrated white woman. Typical antebellum southern flower who loathes her husband's touch, yet envies his sexual relations with a slave woman...I don't know. I became as bitter,frustrated, and hateful of this book as I read on...angry, even.Needless to say I will be getting a refund."
4,Trapped,"Many of the books I read on slavery are about the plight of the slaves, the cruelty of the master or overseer and/or the genteel woman. Rarely, does a character such as Manon Gaudet take center stage. In Valerie Martin's novel, Property, Manon's life is portrayed as being just as horrific as her slaves. She was a lonely woman who is married to a man she despises, she yearns for her freedom. One fateful night, during a slave revolt she finally gets her wish.Property is a book that immediately drew me in. The only comparison between Manon and her slaves was their forced role into servitude. Manon passive/aggressive actions toward the slaves were just as cruel as her husband's outright demeaning and physical administrations. This is a short book with an interesting story. I only wish the slaves; especially Sarah had more of a voice. Regardless, I highly recommend this book.Jeanette"
4,"Interesting, fast read.","Well, this is a very different novel. First, the story was told entirely as a first-person account from the point of view of Manon, the plantation owner's wife. As a general rule, I am not a fan of the first person style of fiction, but it works pretty well here. The author is trying to make some social points about slavery and its effects on both owner and slave, and you will have to decide how well she succeeds. Is Manon a victim of the system, or just a mentally-unbalanced woman? Her husband has a mistress. Did this cause her problems, or were her problems the cause of the affair? Would the effect of the affair on Manon be different if her husband's mistress had not been a slave? Read it and see what you think. I took away one star because I found it a bit slow-moving, but it is a powerful account. A very interesting read, and relatively short. I will probably think about this one for a while."
4,Diseased Minds,"This Mandingo-meets-Wide Sargasso Sea - sorry, that may not be quite fair - novel is an extremely good, albeit brief, read. Set in a gothic Louisiana in the late 1820s, the writer does an excellent and original job of depicting the destructive moral pressure of slavery on the character of the slaveowners, and the cruelty and dehumanizing inflicted on the slaves. One is initially drawn to sympathize with the narrator, trapped with a brutal and ignorant husband and the latter's half-witted illegitmate son; until it becomes clear that the narrator is in her own way equally callous, cruel and elitist. Their society looks up only to money and social prestige; there is a constant threat of bloody slave rebellion erupting, kept in check only barely (and only some of the time) by savage retaliation and punishment.A very perceptive look at human vanity, mean-spiritedness and greed set in a decayed environment of gilt, red velvet and disease."
5,The Best Book From a 5 Star Author,You will not want this slim 200 page book to end. Property is V Martins most engaging book. It is written from the point of view of an early 19th century woman. A woman who owns slaves. Students of fiction should read Property to see how much can be said by omission. The depth of a novel that reads like a short story. This is a remarkable achievement in fiction.
4,Slavery seen from the other side,"This is an excellent quick read that gives an amazing sense of how slavery can pervert slave owners as much as slaves. Evidently well-researched about Louisiana sugar plantations, the book gives a clear look at the paranaoia of slave masters facing imminent revolt and their terror upon realizing they no longer have control over their slaves. It puts a human face both on the slaves and the plantation owners by showing the perspective of how the unhappy wife of slave holder learn to make peace with her slave valet while at times envying her. A different take on the ante-bellum South."
3,Could have been interesting,"I shall place my emphasis on ""could."" The themes of slavery as it affects both the slave owner and her 'property' are lost, because Manon is so totally self centred throughout that one wonders if anything other than her own interests affects her. She resents her own lack of freedom - yet harbours jealousy towards the other major character, Sarah, who has no freedom whatever.Some of the historical references give a flavour of the period, but overall the characters and situations are not well developed. Even the depiction of Manon's husband, who is hated by both wife and concubine, is unclear. Manon's own bitterness clearly filters all action, and one wonders if the depiction is accurate or merely a result of her own feelings. This is more a story of a miserable woman in an unhappy marriage than any in depth treatment of the time."
4,Very Good Book...,"I was hesistant to read this...I dont care to revist this time in our history, its not like I want to put my head in the sand. Over the years I think I got a pretty accurate, rounded understanding of that sad time by way of Tv, History, Books, ect...However I am very gald I got this its a great read it really is. For one getting things from the mistress view was interesting its usually the master of the plantation or the slaves. Once I was able to remind my self it was a differently world and things we would consider incredibly wrong/evil was somewhat normal I was able to follow understand the mistress of the plantation. While she isnt a slave she bound as well she is a tough pill to swollow. This is a failry short book..I encourage you to check it out even if it is not your preferred genre."
4,Different but good story!,"I enjoyed this story, I did like it but it was not as good as I had thought. It had a few shocking parts that did not seem to tie in to the storyline. I absolutely hated the ending, it was left off so abruptly that it seems like there would be a sequal even though there isn't. I liked the story line, I felt for the main character because of how realistic it was back then to deal with that sort of situation. I felt her emotions right alongside her during certain parts. So over all, it was a good story."
4,Chroma Letters,"This lettering kit worked out well. Used them on the back of my truck. Because of the 1/2"" high size, they are subtle, but that suits my application. Had a little trouble with them sliding around on the painted surface, but persisted with pushing them straight on. Just put them through a high pressure wash and they did fine. Could have used some numbers, also."
4,A must have for cooks,"The set that came with my hand mixer rusted too soon after purchase (user error? lack of proper care? quality?). So hubby recommended that we buy replacements online and Amazon is our go-to. Price is reasonable so we bought 2 pairs and now I do NOT allow these to soak in water and take care to dry these immediately after washing. Shipping was timely (for being free, but I do not like to pay for shipping, so it's worth the wait). I hope I do not have to buy any more replacements, but good to know where to go if I need to."
3,Beaters,Unfortunately these beaters did not work with my mixer. The problem wasn't the beaters it was the mixer. So off to the store for a new mixer.
2,Disappointing,"As an enormous fan of ""Give Me One Wish,"" I read Jacquie Gordon's debut fiction novel ""Flanders Point"" with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found the book far too mannered, and it seemed more like a literary experiment than a fully-realized story. The heartfelt emotion of the memoir ""Give Me One Wish"" was missing in ""Flanders Point."" I do hope Jacquie continues writing and explores her talent further, even if I didn't enjoy this novel."
4,"A sensitive, fascinating romance","Flanders Point is a sensitive, fascinating romance, not, as Kirkus would have it, for the juvenile trade, but for anyone who likes good novels about complex relationships. Charlotte Delafield, the heroine, has survived a very unpleasant childhood. At the Haddam school inFlanders Point, she not only survives but thrives, and the love that develops betweenCharlotte and her young English teacher, Brian Parton, is powerful and dangerous. Boththem are young, but both are also strong enough to avoid the dangers. This is a strong,faascinating story."
5,Ellis at Her Best,"The Inn at the Edge of the World is based on the delightful idea of avoiding Christmas or at least what it has become in the modern world. An ill-assorted lot of guests ends up on a tiny Scottish island with secrets of its own, including the omnipresent smell of fish. As usual, Ellis mixes the real and supernatural deftly and believably. The writing is first rate, the characters real and the ending totally unexpected."
2,Quirky,"This story is set in a small hotel on a remote Scottish island, where the characters have gathered to avoid having to celebrate Christmas. Having often wanted to do the same thing myself, I thought the book would be about Christmas, its true meaning, why we celebrate at all, what we accomplish by escaping it, and stuff like that. However, the story has almost nothing to do with Christmas. That's just the excuse the author uses for assembling this group of characters. I've never read anything by Ellis before, so didn't know what to expect. It's a quirky little story, what there is of it. The best parts of it are the characterizations; they are excellent. Each person is drawn and developed so uniquely. I could recognize aspects of myself or friends in each of her story's characters."
5,"lovely humour,very funny and a little sad","brilliant opening in lets talk dirty to the animals!other highlights:introductions to the audition,""I really want this job!"";and Lisa Loopner singing The Way We Were;Emily Litella and Roseanne Roseannadanna classics;then the last track a lovely memory of this great talent."
1,Unbelievable.,"It's astonishing that one could present a biography of Jung and not deal with the many allegations of unprofessional, irresponsible, and certainly bizarre behaviors that have been advanced about this man. For shame!"
4,Solid Workout,"Here is the breakdown of the DVD:There are three levels of workouts. Each workout is 3-6 rounds. Each round is 3 min with a 1 min break in between rounds. Each round is 3 min straight through, meaning you will not put down the kettlebell during the round. Movements are basic foundational kettlebell exercises, nothing fancy.PROS:-The quality of the DVD is good, there is a lot worse out there.-Good workout. It will improve your endurance and strength.-Shawn guides you through the workout with tips and motivation. No cheesy jokes.CONS:-There is no timer on the screen.-There is no instruction on the exercises. This DVD assumes you already have some experience with kettlebells."
5,Great CD!,"I really enjoyed this CD. Jim Burton is a wonderful guitarist. Anyone interested in the Tele country style guitar sound, I highly recommend this CD."
4,Nice 'Little' Country Instrumental Disc,"I've always been a fan of James Burton, but just finally got around to pickin' up this CD. I don't really have anything to add to all the other positive reviews for the disc with regard to the quality of the music, musicianship, influences, etc. However, for others that may be interested in purchasing the CD; be aware that there is only about 26 or 27 minutes worth of music, so I wouldn't pay a whole lot (as in pay a BIG price for a LITTLE bit of music) for what is essentially no more than an EP's worth of music from a time or duration standpoint. Sundazed/EMI should have combined this album with another release and put out a 'Two-fer' package to provide more music for the money."
4,LOVE IT ! LOVED IT! LOVING IT!,I had already borrowed this video from a friend and had to have my own copy. Once again she does not disappoint.
5,"Luv it, luv it, luv it!","I was introduced to Leslie Sansome's work-out DVD's last fall. After being addicted to three of them throughout the fall and winter I took the summer off and enjoyed out of doors exercise. Starting up again this September, I just couldn't get back into doing the same kicks, side-steps, etc. I ordered this DVD and I am once again addicted. I love the new steps, especially the shift, and the change-ups and combinations of the old steps. After doing 5 miles, I am really sweating and feel that I have had an excellent total body work-out and especially the mid-section which is where I need it. I wouldn't recommend this for someone just starting out unless you are in really good physical shape."
2,Disappointed in Mid-drifts and Dancing,"Because of Leslie Sansone's characteristicly wholesome workouts, I recently bought her Walk Slim dvd.I was disappointed.Each ""mile"" includes several walkers dressed in sports bras and low-slung capris, sporting their naked mid-drifts.The cover pictures do not show this.In addition, Leslie has added some new moves, which border dancing.The cover does not describe this.Current exercise fads seem to be replacing the wholesome foundation this workout trainer began on."
3,Lack of sound,"Does anyone else have a lack of sound on this DVD? It's the first one I have bought of hers and I'm new to DVDS such as this one. However, I noticed I can barely hear the beat to be able to properly ""walk, walk, walk,"" to it, and her voice overides the music. Just wondering if anyone else has this issue. Thank you."
3,Leslie Sansone,Just Love this dvd. There are some great workouts in here. Well worth the money. I wish she would put more cardio in to the workout
4,Classic Leslie Sansone DVD,"I really enjoyed this workout DVD. Leslie Sansone keeps you motivated, has easy moves to follow, and is really down to earth. The toning belt adds a nice touch to the workouts to get the upper body toned as well. The other nice part of this DVD is that each mile has its own section so that you can do 1 mile, 2, 3, 4, or all 5. One downfall and the reason for only 4 stars and not 5 is that the moves can be repetitive. This is my go to workout for days when I am not as energetic! Highly recommended if you enjoy walking aerobics."
2,Am I back in the 80s?,"I am usually a big fan of Leslie Sansone, and I own several of her walking DVD's, but this one missed the mark. She strayed from her usual 4 basic moves and incorporated some new moves and very simple combinations. I appreciate her effort to create more variety in her workout, and I can enjoy a good dance workout DVD (which this was NOT), but her end product but was boring, rather cheesy, and reminiscent of a bad 80s workout video. More importantly, I did not feel it was as hard of a workout. I did not feel the ""burn"" in my muscles that I have felt in her other videos, and I was able to do nearly the entire DVD the first night I owned it without hardly breaking a sweat (and no, I am not in that good of shape!). I wanted to like this DVD, but I am quite disappointed. I wish I could return it. Her ""Ultimate collection"" is much better."
2,disappointed.,"i am a huge Leslie fan and was excited to get this latest DVD which had great reviews but i am not as impressed with it as i thought i would be. the music is muffled and i wouldn't consider it ""hit music"". she has a variety of people on the video working out with her but the two she seems to be seen with the most are two extremely thin and gorgeous girls. this personally discourages me because no matter how many Leslie videos i do, i'll never look like that, so why even try. at least i got a workout band... but don't get me wrong it is definitely a workout, just not one i'll want to keep doing."
3,Not very inspiring.,"I do not care for this video very much. The music sounds terrible, which might be a good thing because these songs were hits back in the eighties. I also don't like that I cannot easily choose to do different level of miles on days when I don't have as much time."
1,Useless without lecture notes,"If you hope to use this book to get a general overview of measurement systems, then you may be alright, but if you want to be able to perform actual calculations, you should look elsewhere.This book contains absolutely no worked examples. This leads the reader unable to do the end of chapter problems as the book does not contain detailed mathematical definitions of some of the most important elements contained within in the problems.For instance, in chapter two, you are required to calculate the environmental coupling constants. Sadly, no where in the book does it actually explain how to do this.In summary, Principles of Measurements Systems is an incomplete volume, which reads more like a 1st draft than a 3rd edition.Very disappointing."
2,quite challenging,"I thought this book rather too challenging for the beginner and feel that unless you are pretty knowledgeable about the subject then there are other, simpler books that you should buy."
2,windows xp,i recently installed windows xp home edition on my computer now my camera will not download. what good is it now!
2,I'm Upgrading after One Month,"The good thing about this camera is that with the led screen and the decent software you get a good idea of what owning a digital camera would be like. I love being free of film and developing.But the pictures are too blury to enjoy. I'm too embarassed to send these pictures to my friends and family which was what I bought it for. I took the camera to a party and everyone was moving around, couldn't stop them, and the pictures while cute were too blury. I then took the camera to Mexico. Scenery was okay but again people blurry.But this camera has excited me about owning a real digital camera and helped me know what features to look for. So here I am shopping one month later."
3,response to customer with windows xp in michigan,"there is a way to use your camera with windows xp. you go to the compatability mode and manually change it to windows 95 or 98. buy the windows xp for dummies book. It explains it all. GOOD LUCK. I was upset too, but then i figured it out."
2,Extremely limited in what it can do,"It was my first digital camera, and all I was looking for was something to snap pictures to send via email.For that purpose, it's fine. Sort of. The images are consistently blurry and there isn't a lot of detail thanks to the low-resolution sensor.I decided on a whim to buy a Kodak DX3700 3.1-megapixel camera, hoping to get higher-resolution images (I knew nothing about digicam technology last year...call it naivety). Okay, first of all the Kodak is definitely more expensive. Secondly, the Kodak's photos are light-years better than the Polaroid's. Period.I have now shelved the low-resolution Polaroid and have used the Kodak exclusively.If you're on a budget and don't mind inferior images, then the Polaroid is great. But if you plan on printing your pictures, then get at least a 3.0-megapixel digicam and ignore this Polaroid entirely."
3,An oldie now but good when it was new,This little guy was good when it first came out but now there are so many new cameras out there for around the same price you might want to find something else since the software for this camera is no longer updated from what I understand.
2,well.,"Basiclly, I bought this camera after a short term job, and I decided it was all I could afford at the time.Truthfully..the camera has not been good enogh for what I wanted, but do you really expect that from a digital camera under 100 dollars? Really, you won't find a better camera for this price, but you won't get much out of it. I know I will be re-saleing this camera as soon as I get a better job, so I can take pictures at a better clarity, though my most useful trick with the camera is to take all of your pictures at the high resolution option, and then resize them with your paint program, it helps create a sharper image.If you are just planning to take close up pictures of your face or something, it's a good camera, but if you wanted to take pictures of vacations, or scenary, you will not like this, and I suggest you wait a few months until you can afford a better camera."
4,Great for the price !,"I got this camera as a gift. It's easy to use, takes great pictures and the batteries last a long time. For those who complain about the LCD screen ? [....] A great deal from Polaroid a well known name."
2,"How to get around the ""Not compatible with Windows NT"" error",If you use the program compatability wizard on the setup program on the CD the software for the camera will install and run fine in XP. I rated the camera low because mine too has the same issues with the lcd (mylar ribbon inside the camera loses contact) and I do agree that all serial port connected cameras are slow to transfer images(after all serial ports were only designed for analog modems anyway). My camera also has a single bad pixel in the center of the CMOS imager that is always black.
2,Easy to Use,"Very easy to use & I like the automatic timer, but I wish it were more than 10 secs. The pictures do not come out too good unless you are really close to the object. They must remain still or the pictures come out blurry. The LCD Screen goes away after 5 secs of no activity, should be longer. I have on several occasions, had blue dots show up in the black areas of my picture. Was trying to load on a tripod & the camera slipped & the battery door broke. Basically, it is ok for stills (like portraits). If you have anything else in mind - you will be disappointed."
1,Great Price -- Bad Pics,I read reviews on this camera and decided to go with it simply because it was the only one in my price range that had an LCD screen. I didn't even benefit from the screen because it was so blurry that the only thing you could do was see if the picture you took was remotely worth keeping. The serial cable transfer is way to slow and the software that came with it really stinks!! I am going back to the Kodak EZ 200 that I had before I got this mockery of a camera.
1,looks like a good idea but disappoints,bought the product to fix what i consider to be a minor scratch. the wax pencil flaked and fell off & the polish was ineffective...if you have a scratch that needs to be fixed i recommend going to an auto parts store to find a touch-up paint kit.
4,Good enough.,"I've used this for two cars now, and it's pretty helpful. It's much better than those other scratch removing products, which I've had no luck with. It comes in a large bottle that should last awhile, along with a waxy crayon that fills in the majority of the scratch. The liquid is basically just a colored wax that finishes off the repair. It's much easier and of course cheaper than repainting, but be aware that it's not a permanent fix. You'll have to use it nearly every time you wax, as it wears off just like wax does. But it does reduce the appearance of small scratches and chips, which is what it's supposed to do. Worth it."
2,tutle wax blue color,This wax is OK. Not great but I would use it again if it was available on the shelf but for the price online it is not worth it to me. The 'color' stick is a crayon and really doesnt do much. As stated in some other online advice 'your girlfriend's fingernail polish comes in more colors and works better'. I tried the fingernail polish and it works. The color stick crayon works as well as you would expect.
4,Great unit,Great bike. This unit is great. My daughter enjoys it. The braking system is also unique with both front and rear. The front disc brake is especially unique. The only item this could have used would have been a key. Maybe they will do that on the next model.
2,"Totally fun, not reliable","Totally cool product, kids had fun, I had fun!Problem was reliability when the bike was 2 weeks old!Charging plug on bike prevented proper charging resulting in dead bike!No fun!Razor sends out new part, owner supplies labor, NO fun!On/Off switch breaks, can not turn off bike!No fun, battery dies!Razor sends new switch, owner supplies labor, NO fun!"
1,Razor works for a while and than try to get help!,My son got this in October. It worked great for a while. Than the unit stopped fully recharging and goes slow. I called the company who gave me the name of a center to service it. This was afer 1 day of owning it. I called the center who does not return calls. I had to call razor who said they can send me a battery but i would have to pay for the install. I did it and the next battery did the same thing. They sent me two more batteries and I tried one which just died after 3 min. I have anothr battery and a piece of garbage in my garage. I do not have hours and hours to spend on this. The stores do not return them so i m out of luck and so will you if you buy this.
1,Razor dirt rocket,"I bought this razor dirt rocket electric bike...it came without the axle and spacer an washers, nuts to hold it all together...I need help finding out how to get this part I paid for.order received 1/18/2007. If I get this part I would rate it 5 stars.Sharon Tilton in Calif"
1,"Missing parts, broken parts","What a disaster! Came without the front axle and several other parts. Box was a mess, parts were broken. Another reviewer said the same thing, but I thought amazon would have fixed the problem by now. BUYER BEWARE!!! Disappointed son on his birthday. Amazon did give a prompt refund and sent UPS to pick up."
3,Defective Product when New,Received the Motocross bike a few days before Christmans. Would not run as battery would not hold any charge. Took the Bike to authorized dealer who confirmed the battery was defective. Company was notified and they said the replacement battery would not be shipped for at least 5 to 7 weeks.This is not an acceptable service or support system for a new product. I would not recommend this companys products to anyone.Carl Moore
1,Terrible customer service,"From day one our Razor MX Dirt Rocket wouldn't last for more than 2 minutes. About a month after purchase, I contacted Razor directly, since there are warnings all over not to return to the retailer. The Razor rep said they would send a battery/electric motor replacement unit and that no replacement of the Dirt Rocket itself was allowed. To make a long story short, I never received the battery/electric motor unit and when I contacted Razor, the response I got was that they didn't have record of my original contact and that it was now past the 90 day warranty. Needless to say, our family will never purchase a Razor product again."
1,1 week of fun,"We purchased this for our 10 year old son. It was great for 1 week- then the back tire stripped out and now it won't run. When we went online to see what to do- there were other reviews-not on Amazon- about this problem. Now we have to spend the next 3 weeks taking it to a repair shop and getting a new back wheel put on. Make sure your children ONLY ride this in the street and not ""hard"" it will strip the gears and wreck the back tire!"
1,rear wheel problem,"Bought for my son for Xmas, rode about 8X, rear wheel stopped working. Cannot buy replacement part due to ""Out of Stock"". Same problem as with many others who reviewed. Do not buy, it's tempting, but risk is not worth it. Big waste of $ and dissapointed kid."
5,BEST SCOOTER EVER!!!!!,I just got this 2 days ago and am thrilled. It only took about 30 mintues to assemble it. It goes about 18 mph. It has a big shock and big front wheel! It is so awsome!! I highly recommened this!!! BUY IT!!
4,Great ride for a pre-teen,"We bought this bike for our daughter at Christmas. She absolutely loves it. We live in a cold climate (near Buffalo, NY) so after she rides it we are having her bring it in the house...the biggest complaint I have is it is so heavy...tough to bring back into the house, up the stairs. It is a perfect size for my 11 year old (she is pretty tall - 4'-10"") and I was afraid she would be intimidated by the weight of the bike but she is doing great with it. I would recommend it for any child and we are thinking of grabbing the bigger one for my 15 year old son. Holds a charge for a couple hours of constant running."
4,Does the job!,"Recently purchased this dirt bike for our six year old son. This bike has plenty of power for a six year old. Easy to assemble. Poorly packaged for shipping: arrived in original packaging and was very beat up with holes in the box but luckily nothing was missing or damaged. Battery seems to last a long time and does not take long to charge. Can easily carry a two hundred pound person. Suspension is adjustable in the rear, but has no shocks, only springs. Very good idea for someone not ready to purchase a gas powered bike."
3,Broken and missing pieces due to hole in shipping box.,"My Son researched this item and paid for it with his own money, only to be let down when it arrived. What a terrible way to ship a heavy item. I did call customer support and they were very helpful and are having the missing items shipped to me. Only part that I do not like about this part was that the parts are in stock, but it will take 7 to 10 days to receive these parts. I guess they are teaching my 10 year old patience. I received this MX500 on 7/27/07 and am writing this review on the same date."
4,Long term driving test results,"My friends bought this mini bike over a year ago and now it is mine. We have ridden it hard. I have put on a new rear tire since we totally wore out the original. New break lever and front break disc, and a new set of batteries and controller. Over time wires will come loose and some of the plastic parts may break, but most of it is easy to fix and all the parts are available online. Mind you--it is a toy. If you are ""off road"" rough with it you will break it."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY KID!!!!!!,"iT ARRIVED IN RECORD TIME. Took just 5 minutes to put together and he was off and riding. A perfect gift for our 8 year old. Went just fast enough for both he and I. The charge lasts a long time and he is madly in love with it. We bought the 350 for his last birthday and were thrilled with that one, this one is much much better. a score all around....."
1,Dont buy,It sounds like I am not the onl;y one has had issues with this and Razor certainly doesnt stand behind it. Worked great for awhile then it seemed like it wouldnt charge. Checked battery with a meter and the battery was good and when checking throttle it was sending right amount of volts to motor. Motor done in less than 6 months. Had another Razor scooter a few years before and within a year the motor on that went as well. If you want it to work for just a short time it is a great product. But dont expect anything over 6-9 nmonths out of it. I have purchased my last Razor product. I understand things happen but when they have happened on both Razor products I have purchased and Razor was willing to do nothing about it well that to me says it all. Garbage Product!
5,Razor MX500 Dirt Rocket Electric Motocross Bike,This product is GREAT!...my son is having fun with this bike...bought a halmet for my son and he looks COOL!
3,my son loves it,"overall thus far its been OK , when we put it together it looked as if someone had returned it. One tire was flat and the back fender was scuffed up. other than that its been great."
3,Good for a week...,"Hey ""Duh"" from Rockford, MI, you make us look bad here in MI you moron. Dint yer maw learnt ye ta spelt any thin?Ah well, moving on...this bike is great for 7-8 year olds for about a week. After a couple of spills and getting it wet this bike starts to show that it is all show, no go."
1,ANTENTION PARENTS,"HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ,dont get me started gas powered dirt bikes=mutch better. eletric powered= sucks my opnion is dont by anything eltric or moroize cuaes evry thing honda or razor suck,i like real honda dirt bikes but not this eletronic dirt bike ,ha they should even call it a dirt bike more like a bike with a motor slapped on!!!!!! its not durable or fun!if your one of those over protective moms that wants there momas boy safe then this porduct is for them or if u want to be a cool mom then by a gas powered dirt bike there thank u when they turn pro pulling back flips of a jump making milloins every day!! or u could just follow them hand an foot kissing there boo boos an scrapes!! ps:my grammar might suck"
1,illegal,"Do not buy this! I am 14 years old and I saved my money for 3 months to buy this. I finnaly ordered it and was extremely excited! I assembled it, charged it, and the next day, I rode in my neighborhood. A cop drove buy and got out of the car and told me that it was illegal to ride those. It got impounded and I had to pay a $120 plus $150 dollars to get it back. Now, I have spent a grand total of $570 and I have a useless dirtbike in my garage. Dont buy!!!! There Illegal in almost every state!!!"
2,Bike is a huge disappointment!!,"I got this bike for my son over a year ago. At first, it was a great bike and a lot of fun. Then the bike stopped running. First we had to buy a new rear wheel that cost $50. It was easy to put on. Then we had to replace a control module. It was not so easy. I thought that maybe everything would be fine, but today it has stopped running again. And once again the problem is the rear wheel. I have already put almost as much money into the bike that I originally spent on it. So, it is not worth buying another rear wheel. Not to mention, what is the point in buying another part that will eventually break again. I think that the Razor company needs to acknowledge that the rear wheel assembly is defective and fix it. I will not waste my money on a Razor MX500 again until they do. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Cheap Electric Toy,"Hi...maybe we were UNLUCKY!! But the first Razor Motorcycle we got from Amazon had broken gears. We would give it some 'gas' and the rear sprocket would just spin, as if the gears were not engaging with the sprocket/chain. So we returned that first bike, and Amazon sent us a new one at no charge (which was great). Unfotunately the SECOND bike wasn't much better. The battery on the second bike didn't hold a charge. We followed the directions for how to charge it initially, which we did, but now the yellow like on the throttle always shows ""lit"" meaning that it needs a charge, eventhough we had it on the chareger for several hours. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...IT'S NOT WORTH IT."
1,Yet another rear wheel defect - x2!!!!,"This is ridiculous and we are completely frustrated. We bought this bike for my son's birthday. He paid half of it with his birthday money. 5 days after we bought it, the rear wheel stopped working. Same problem as many others (read below) where the wheel just stops turning. We waited for the part from Razor for 6 weeks and finally asked the store where we bought it to take it back. They graciously did, and we had another one assembled for us. 3 weeks later, the EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!!!!! Razor!! You need to recall this defective product and give the people their money back!"
1,WARNING - DONT BUY RAZOR PRODUCTS,"I PURCHASED THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS, WHEN I WENT TO PUT BIKE TOGETHER IT WAS MISSING PARTS, CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WERE NO HELP. I HAVE SEEN OTHER REVIEWS THAT SAID RAZOR HAS POOR PRODUCTS AND POORER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. DONT BUY RAZOR PRODUCTS."
2,Worked fine for the first 3 months,"Much has been written about the Razor electric motocross bikes. So, I would just like to add that the Bike stopped working one day after the warranty expired."
5,Very Good Product,"I bought this bike for my very big 6 year old for Christmas and he loves it. Before I bought it, I thought 100 lbs would be to much for him to handle, but he rides it very well. My 2 older children love to ride it as well."
2,Fun for the time it lasted,"i got this item on november 7. and the box came scratched and the dirt bike had a flat tire right out of the box! also right know it makes a whining sound whenever you ride it, and it only runs for 25 min. not the told 45. anyway my friend got this and his also was broken but he sent it back and know he has a good one. I suggest this item to plenty of people but if you are worried about the chance of a scratched and tore box or a broken bike don't get it."
5,My son loves this bike. What an awesome bike for the price!,We have looked at several local stores for this bike only to find out it was out of stock. Thanks Amazon!
2,Defective,Was very disappointed that a part on the tire/chain broke immediately & we needed to wait for a replacement part. This is an ongoing defect with these bikes that needs to be corrected BEFORE they sell them.
5,Moms review for 9 year old,"I was skeptical about this because of the recommended age. My husband insisted we get this one (the bigger one). My son has never ridden a dirt bike and he took to this like a fish to water. We have had no issues and it works great. I would say this is perfect for his age/size. The battery life has been fine, went together easily and hopefully will be working fine for a long time. It was such a huge hit with our son."
1,Defects,"We bought 2 of the MX500 bikes for Christmas for my 2 sons. Used less than 10 times and the Flywheel on the rear wheel broke (my sons weigh less than 70lbs and they only rode on pavement). Not covered under warrenty because after 90 days (bought in November 2006 but kids did not really start to use until spring). From reading other reviews this appears to be a common defect but Razor will not replace the rear wheel for free. Even if I wanted to purchase rear wheel replacement from Razor - it is out of stock which further makes me believe this is a defect.Fun when product works, but I would not recommend buying because of defect."
2,"Fun for kids, but breaks and costly/timely to repair","It is a great like bike for kids to have fun riding.Unfortunately there is a defect with the rear wheel assembly. Recently our 2nd wheel broke where it will only freewheels (spins) and won't engage to drive the wheel. Unlike a bicycle, they don't sell the center hub (broken part), but only the whole assembly. Very wasteful of both money and material resources to only sell this entire piece."
3,Great till the rear wheel stops working after a year,"Bought the MX 500 for my son 3 years ago. He loved it and had no problems until the rear wheel failed to engage after about a year of use. Called Razor and they said that the gear was stripped so I need to buy a new rear wheel, $50. Replaced the rear wheel and it worked like new. Son got busy with other stuff and did not ride it for 6 months. Took it out charged it up and away he went. After a few passes it stopped working rear wheel drive mechanism again. Called Razor they would not replace it. If you buy one of these moto bikes be ready to spend some cash later to replace the rear wheel, I am sure I am not the only one. Other than that power it up and have fun."
1,Return cost a fortune!!!,"Be careful about buying this bike!! If you have to return it, you will be out a lot money. The bike is too large for our child, it is VERY heavy for him. Unfortunately, UNbeatablesale will not help out with cost of the return. It's going to cost us @ $200 dollars!! I'm so used to just trusting Amazon.com to work with top notch sellers that I never even considered the case of a return. BIG mistake. No where in their return policy does it say it say that the sole responsibility for returns is on the customer. Sorry that Amazon works with this company as they do not have a clear return payment policy. They simply say that they will not send out prepaid return labels. This brief statement leaves a lot of room for interpretation."
5,Great bike!,"My son absolutely loves this bike. I even tried it out, it's great!! I would most certainly recommend this product."
5,Grandson,My grandson is still riding this dike bike. we had two tire changes and a multitide of other repairs but he is still riding. Good product . The repairs was just plain wear and tear of a 5 year old boy
5,Love this moto bike,"I bought the Razor Mx500 dirt rocket for my sons 6th birthday. He loves it. He previously had the mx 350 (handed down from older brother) which is still working. These are a great value for someone who is not ready to commit to the traditional gas powered bike. It is easy to assemble, looks great, and the charge lasts for a long time."
5,The best money I spent,"The Razor MX500 is the best money I spent. It is well worth it and my 8 year old son loves it (not to mention all the kids on the block as well). I was alittle hesitant on buying it, because the product reads ages 14+ (which is just for Razor policy safety reasons to cover their butts if someone got injured). It is so easy to assemble, about 20 min and it is pretty fast, about 15-17 miles like is reads on description. On a hill, forget it, it goes even faster, so I definitely suggest a helmet at all times. The charging time is great and my son and his friends go on it all day without the charging light indicater, which turns yellow, going on. I am not sure why I read bad reviews on it, but this bike is amazing. I even went on it and I am about 165lbs (the max recommended weight is 175lbs). My neighbors kids loved it so much, that I believe there will be two more of these purchased very soon on my block."
5,Razor MX500 Dirt Bike,We purchased the Razor MX500 for our 4 year old son. He wanted a dirt bike and we didn't want to pay for the gas powered bike until we made sure he could ride and that this was something he would like for longer then a month. He loved it and has ridden it for over a year and it's still going. This was a great purchase and less expensive then purchasing it direct from the local retail toy store. My husband and oldest son who is 16 were even able to ride it. Fantastic purchase.
1,Disappointment,WE purchased this bike as a gift for my 10 year old son as his main Christmas present. He got on to ride his new bike on Christmas morning and the Razor did not work properly. We evaluated all of the troubleshooting scenarious on the website. From everything we can tell the rear wheel is not engaging. The motor drives the chain does not engage the wheel to produce momentum. We are very dissatisfied at this moment.
5,A very Entertaining collection,"This is one of the most enjoyable books I ever read. The odd characters made it all the more funny. Being a recent peruser of Russian books and having developed an interest in them, I am up and ready for more Russian stories. The stories are deep, witty and humorous in a classic way. It comes after The Usurper and Other Stories as my second collection read this year. The stories are fine and hilarious and Chekhov's books to good to read."
2,Not one of the best.,"I thought this episode was one of the weirdest. I usually like weird but this went its own way. I not quite sure how to explain what happened to Geordi and many of the people on his pevious ship but they are mighty ugly. If you are getting just a few of the videos in the series skip this one, go for one of the many other fabulous episodes like cause and effect. If however you are going for the complete collection it's a must."
4,Adults only entertainment fun!,"I love this as do I love all the Jeff Dunham things. I have a nine year old grandson who also likes to watch with me, but I really have to pick and choose segments because of the language and explicit material sometimes. I challenge Mr. Dunham to use his tremendously awesome comedic sense and ventriloquist talent to add a line for older youngsters."
2,a bit disappointed,"We have seen much of Dunham's previous shows & have liked them all. This one seemed to lack something... some funny sections, but overall, disappointing & predictable. Enjoyed the behind the scenes footage of how he makes all his own ""friends"" though. Should have waited until it came on Comedy Central."
4,Jeff dunham,Very funny. I like the costumes he has for the puppets.I always look foreward to when Jeff Dunham puts out another DVD
5,Silence! You'll die laughing!,Jeff Dunham is hilarious by himself -- as you can tell from his intro warm-ups -- but once those words start coming out of his family of little people .... it's just ROFLMAO time.
3,"good, not great","My husband and I love Jeff Dunham and expected to enjoy this one also. It was good, but seemed quite short and not as funny as all the others. His characters are great as themselves but making them be something else, i.e. monsters, didn't quite come across. He is the best we have ever seen and will continue to enjoy his shows, but this one missed the mark a little."
4,Jeff Fun-ham,Funny and very entertaining. Love Peanut and Walter. Not as good as his other shows but still loved this one.
5,Minding the Monsters,"I took my fiance' to Jeff's Controlled Chaos performace in Spokane, Washington back in March and we were part of the very first audience to hear some of the new material he was writing for this video, so it was a bonus for us. Very cool material. Carey was thrilled with his gift and we're looking forward to seeing the completed video as soon as it comes out next month."
2,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this performance of Jeff Dunham's. most of the humor was trash and always bashing his ex wife. He needs go back and look at other performances and start again.
2,It was just ok,My husband and I watched this DVD last night. He had a monologue at the beginnig that seemed pretty long. I kept wondering when he was going to bring out the characters! The characters were dressed in their Halloween costumes which was cute but the characters just weren't as funny as in the past. We laughed only a couple of times but not to the point where we had tears in our eyes and wanted to hit the rewind button to hear it over and over again (as in his DVD's in the past). I would have to say that it was a bit of a disappointment.
2,Wife made BIG mistake,"I ordered this early for my husbands birthday present, it came approx. 1 month early. He saw it on tv. He came to me & said don't waste your money on this one as it wasn't that good etc. I got up & gave it to him at that point! I don't who got the last laugh so to speak. He then starting saying that maybe it was because tv had cut some of it out etc, I don't know if he has watched it or not."
3,Jeff's divorce has affected him badly,"I've tracked Mr Dunhams work since he first started in showbusiness. Yes its true- there was a time when Peanut was just simply ""nuts""! (And normally he improves with age) but in this show you can tell that Jeff's heart just isn't as far into it as he normally is. This pictular show has,,,a darkness, an overcast if you will. He takes a few jabs at his FORMER wife with jokes about his arch enemy- ""Al E. Mony"" and his hero ""New Husband Guy"".He did light up a bit with the prospect of his new fiance, and his alter ego Walter summed it up quite well when he says ""When the Warden calls, you don't sit back down in the chair and strap yourself in,,,,""But some of us like being married. I'd also like to point out that its cheaper to rent a wife by the hour off craigslist than it is to pay divorce fees, and theres some of us who are also brain damaged."
3,Minding the Monsters,"A typical Jeff Dunham product. At times funny and thought provoking. At other times, not so much. I usually enjoy his humor and satirical with a bit more."
5,Great Fun with memorable characters,The humor was fresh and without excessive profanity which is so common with comedians.The special features that revealed how Dunham designed and built his characters was fascinating.
5,The Best Yet,"Great video. We love anything of Jeff Dunham. The unedited version wasn't all that bad, as I let my 10 yr old watch it."
4,good,my family enjoys jeff dunham so i bought this for them to enjoy. it is a good addition to the rest of their jeff dunham library.
3,It's Jeff Dunham,"While Jeff Dunham is superb at his craft, a masterful ventriloquist, I'm getting a little annoyed at some of the material he's injecting into his act. I'm no prude, but, in my opinion, he's becoming a little to bawdy and over the top in his acts. There are ways you can be 'off color' (look at Bill Engval) without becoming obnoxious or obscene or gross."
4,Jeff Dunham Monsters,This movie is funny as always with Jeff Dunham. The format was kind of off in my book. I prefer his stand up routine over this anyday.
2,Sorry!,"Some of these reviews were from people who had not even seen the DVD or TV show yet. So those reviews of 5 stars need to be ignored. Sorry. We love love loveJeff Dunham but we are not overly impressed with this particular show. This one just doesn't come up to par compared to some of the others. Aside from the additional ""bleeps"" and stabs at is ex wife (heck he still has 3 daughters, think how these stabs will seem to them... ) it still seemed the material was not quite as great as the past. Again, we love Jeff, and particularly Walter and Achmed and will look forward to any future shows but this one just didn't do it."
2,Poor Jeff-fa-fa,"He got divorced and now has a new fiance. He used to be so funny. He is leaning more and more towards a dirty mind and trashing his now ex-wife on his show. Be funny for the people, not mad at your ex. Peanut is the funniest and Jose and Little ugly ass Jeff makes an appearance as the ""Loser""."
4,Better than the 4th disc,This was almost as good as the first 3 specials. He wasn't as angry as the 4th special which was right after his divorce. I like his take on the monsters.
4,A must for your collection.,Jeff is in rare form in this video. Still fresh and funny. Anyone who likes Jeff Dunham should have this.
3,It's OK but not as good as his earlier DVDs,"To many bitter snipes about his ex-wife and the divorce settlement, taints the whole thing. And those references are just not funny."
5,Great laughs,"It amazes me how Jeff Dunham is able to have all these conversations with himself. Let's face it, he is holding some very funny conversations inside his head. Most of us would be put away for half the things he says. Laugh til you feel better."
5,Great Holloween comedy.,"The intro by AJ reminds me of the crypt keeper's voice, at least right up until he laughs. Meanwhile the rest of the video is a good mix of humor and interaction with the puppets. The only complaint I may have is this one is shorter than his previous ones."
5,Jeff fa fa! Dunham - dot com,"This was one of my daughter's Christmas presents. She loved it as she is an avid fan of: Peanut, Walter, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, Bubba J, Little Jeff, Achmed Jr., and Jose Jalapeno on a stick."
5,MINDING THE MONSTERTS,"JEFF DUNHAM ALL HIS DVD,S ARE A GREAT T HAVE HIS COLLECTION . NEVER WATCH JUST ONCE ALWAYS A MUST REPEAT SHOWING"
2,Love Jeff Dunham and the gang but....,This video was well made but seemed to pale compared to Jeff's earlier works.It was still good but simply lame.
5,best show!!!,"Minding the Monsters,this one the best and funniest shows i have ever seen, definetly one of Dunham's best!!! Great Job!!!"
3,Not Good,I have bought all of Jeff's dvd's and loved them all.I was bummed out on this one.Not so funny.Sorry but it really wasn't good.
4,Fun!,I love Peanut and the whole gang. However I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as the Christmas special. Still worth buying.
5,Harlious for the family,I love Jeff Dunham he is great! The characters he comes up with are fun and goofy. Most of what you think is going to happen never does it is always something you least expect. I laughed through the whole show.
4,Funny stuff,"Hilarious as usual for Jeff, I can't wait for his next video to come out. This one is kind of a new theme for him."
5,minding the genius,jeff dunham is a great entertainer and this is no exception his solo in the first part was great but you come for the little guys and they don't fail
5,funny!,when feeling down just pop this DVD in and you no longer are.Full of laughs!They are all funny in each skit!
5,minding the monsters,"It was great. very funny. My friends and I watched it together, and we laughed till it hurt. Keep it up"
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed! Thought after the Christmas DVD, it would be good. The content appeared even more racial. Not necessary!Would not be good for young people to watch."
1,not good,"i seen this and i was very disappointed in this. it is very hard for me to laugh and i watched jeff dunham's spark of insanity and arguing with myself, i laughed my ass off, both of those really made me laugh. his christmas special made me laugh a little bit not much. but lately his controlled chaos, his t.v.show, and now minding the monsters were garbage. i didn't laugh, not even a giggle, not even a smile. those 3 shows were really bad. i think jeff dunham is losing his edge and he should go back and looked at spark of insanity, arguing with myself, because those were his best work."
1,Disappointing,"Have previously enjoyed watching Jeff Dunham shows with my family, but not this one. Too many sleazy references, too many stabs at his ex-wife. He used to be original and funny, but this show is nearly offensive."
2,He's done better work,I watched the TV special and was sorely disappointed. I have loved all of his earlier works but the Minding the Monsters show was all about hating the ex-wife. He's said some very typical ex-wife stuff before but not to this level. The shows staging was very cool and Peanuts entrance was the best. But that was the show. I remember laughing out loud just once. He definitely needs to go back to the beginnings when he was funny. I hope he turns it around. Glad I did not purchase the DVD.
2,Really Boring.......,"Sorry Jeff. I am a Huge fan and have the greatest respect for you. IMO you are the best Ventriloquist there has ever been. All the previous shows you have done was fantastic, could not stop laughing. This show was painful to watch it was Boring and you seemed to be reaching to get laughs with all the body part and filthy or racist jokes. I always thought the best comedians ever are the ones who don't have to be filthy to get a laugh. I may have laughed once this whole show, even my wife who watches the most stupidest filipino shows ever (ones that reminded me of Banana split or H.R. Pufnstuf type) told me she thought it was boring. That's saying alot. Again have huge respect for all his work give 2 stars for previous."
2,Disappointing performance,"I am a huge fan of Jeff Dunham and as another review put it, a lot of these other reviews are from people who haven't even seen this set!There were very few laughs while watching this set. Jeff is an excellent ventriloquist and generally great comedian. However, there was no spark in this particular act.His show in 2007, ""Spark of Insansity"" was his best yet and this performance is subpar in comparison. I'll still give this 2 stars out of respect. Sorry!"
5,Jeff Dunham....what else needs to be said,"Achmed, Peanut, Bubba J, Walter....all are great and Jeff will keep you rolling on the floor. Highly recommended for Jeff Dunham fans."
4,Funny but not suited for familys,"I bought it as a christmas gift for my husband and thought we could watch it as a family. We really like Jef Dunham, but I was sort of disappointed that he did so much ex-wife bashing."
4,monsters of fun,Jeff Dunham is great. His shows are always very funny and entertaining and Mining the Monsters is no exception. Greatfor the whole family.
5,Jeff Dunham,"I love watching Jeff Dunham's comedy, this video was better than expected. If you are Jeff Dunham fan this is a must have."
3,Disappointed compared to Jeff's previous work,"While some of this was funny, I found a lot of it just borderline offensive. This video didn't come close to Jeff's previous work. I didn't find myself laughing outloud much and found myself trying to decide if some of the jokes were even funny, or just rude. I am not a prude and have no problem with racial, sexist, or other types of jokes....just thought he was picking without it being humorous."
4,Minding the Monsters,"I really enjoyed this DVD, however, I don't think it is one of Jeff's finest. But I do recommend it for all Jeff Dunham fans."
3,Monsters,"Cute idea. Dunham was funny as usual, the detail for the set and haunted house brought the theme home. Loved the extras on creating the monsters."
3,Not what I was expecting,"The amazing talent of Jeff Dunham is on full display, but there is an underlying bitterness that is very hard to overlook. It looks like his favorite member of his mini militia has shifted from Peanut to Achmed. Every good comic needs a memorable tag-line. Peanut's ""Neeeyommmm"" is obviously not as memorable as Achmed's ""Silence! I Keel you!"" Jeff's refreshing use of schitzophrenia as entertainment has not changed. I cannot overlook the bitterness in this show. I hope things get better for you Jeff. You are a truly amazing and gifted man. Peanut will always be MY favorite......"
1,Seller blatantly lied,"I bought this used, but the condition was advertised as 'Used - Very good.' When I received it, the box and disk had rental stickers on them, and the disk was scratched like hell and struggles to play. So avoid the seller.As for the video, I love Jeff Dunham stuff, and he and his monsters are always funny and entertaining to watch."
3,It was good,It was funny. I don't think it was his best work but I am very glad we bought it. He is still awesome!
1,"Review of ""Minding the Monsters""",I chose this item because I have seen other dvds of Jeff Dunham's which were very funny. This one wasn't very funny. He kept making obtuseremarks about his recent divorce. It was really boring. I took it on vacation to share with several members of the family. No one liked it.I would not recommend it.
1,wrong region,"i cant watch the dvd because its in the wrong region, none of the extras work, an the full show doesnt play all the way through"
1,Can play DVD..,"Hi, i've received the dvd last few weeks.. But when i try to play it last week, it can play.. It says that different region code.. It's the same problem for the other dvd that i bought, Jeff Dunham Controlled Choas.. How do i solve this problem?"
1,Great,"We enjoide all your dvds , we seen your show at West Pount for the first time in person and we had a good time!"
2,Overly Sophomoric and Unoriginal,"Wow... what a disappointment. Cute for sure, but mostly unoriginal humor and overly sophomoric with just too many references to bodily functions and appendages. I am usually a huge Jeff Dunham fan... not so much for this one. Worth the price of purchase? Perhaps from the used category. Worth the time to watch? Not really. Hopefully the next one will be better."
5,Such great fun!!!,"My granddaughter was thrilled when she saw this new Jeff Dunham DVD! We love all the extras, which we watch first. Love it!"
5,Best Diaper,I love these diapers and am very frustrated they are currently unavailable in the USA! These are the best and most ecofriendly diapers I have found.
5,Superb,"Nature Boy & Girl diapers are easily the best diapers my little girls has used. The diapers are soft and flexible, and yet keep anything that comes out of the user. Add environmental friendliness to that, and you got pretty good diapers. To us, these diaper have been worth the extra cost. Highly recommended!"
4,HP Mobile Printer,"I recently purchased this printer to use on domestic and international business trips. Unit has performed flawlessly, with excellent document resolution. Simple to use and travels well, even after I dropped the unit twice going through TSA check points. Only drawback is that it is a little bulky and I had to purchase a new computer bag to carry the printer and lap top on airlplane trips. Well worth the investment, no hesitation to purchase this product. Would also be great printer for students at home or in college."
2,"May be nice features, BUT...",I'm a tech. who recently tried to help install & configure the wifi printer server card which later turned out to be faulty. Installing this printer card properly can become a nightmare! It took over two hrs. with helpful (but SLOW ONLINE LIVE HELP) HP support to finally figure out the card was bad. There are also possible firmware upgrade issues on this wifi device to be aware of. Setting up the different profiles for this rig is not for the novice.
1,"Blew up and destroyed my satellite tv input and, seemingly, my Plasma TV","I bought this printer and used it to print up material away from home twice. Then after I had plugged it in at home there was an explosion when I tried to connect it to the USB port of my computer. Our satellite TV quit working immediately, the input had been blown and had to be replaced. Our 42"" Plasma TV (2 years old) quit working a few days later. Strangely the USB port where the explosion occurred seems to be fine. I had enjoyed it until it proved to be very faulty."
1,"Slow printer, big and clunky, blew up my USB Ports!","I had this computer for one day and when it worked, it was slow and noisy. I took it on a trip and it occupied most of the desk I used for my laptop. How anyone could call this a ""portable"" is beyond me. What a waste of money! Then, after a week of use, I plugged it into the USB port and, WHAM! It killed my computer for two hours! When the computer started running again, guess what--no USB Ports! I got on tech support and confirmed that the printer fried my USB ports. If you really feel you have to have this printer, WARNING: Get the PCMCIA card with USB and Printer Power Port. You won't get your USB ports zapped dead! Let the buyer beware! My next portable will be a Canon."
3,its oka takes time to work,"i used it for under arm dark color, since a deordarant burned my armpits lol i used it for a bit, but the difference wasnt much, so i just stopped using it,"
5,Black and White Cream,"I was very pleased to receive the cream sooner than expected. I haven't used the product yet because I purchased it to lighten a discoloration on my skin. However, I decided later to make an appointment with a dermatologist to check the discoloration so I am waiting until after my appointment to use the product. As to the response time, however, I would definitely recommend this seller."
1,=(,i only like it cos you dont need to use a whole lot but i wouln't personaly but this product cos it works prety slow. good luck!
2,well....,I've been using it for a couple weeks it has faded my sun damage but not enough for anyone that sees me everyday to notice and when once applied it take a while to soak in.
5,WORKS GREAT,"This product works. I use twice a day, and apply SPF over to help acne dark spots fade.Its not greasy, but a little thick. The price is great too"
1,Can't use because I am breastfeeding.,"I purchased this product for the slight melasma (dark blotches that appear due to pregnancy) that appeared on my face during pregnancy. The dark blotches were not going away after my pregnancy so I decided to give this a try, but once I received it it said breastfeeding women should not use it. I wish this would have been in the items description. So now it is just sitting in my cabinet until after I am done breastfeeding."
2,no white here,Used on my ARM to try removed spots.did not work and I did use with the soap.still have the spots.
4,Black & White,"I have used this product for nearly one month. My (10+ year old) scars have become about 40 percent lighter, so I will continue to use this cream. I found much more significant results using this product than the using three months of Ambi Fade Cream...so I'm pleased. Also, the shipping was fine."
1,Ineffective,Used as explained and still was ineffective after long-term use. Waste of money. Would not buy again and would not recommend.
1,Not working for me.,I have been using the Black & White Bleaching Cream for approximately a month. I use it twice a day for dark circles under the eyes and one age spot on the side of my face. I have not seen any changes to my complexion at either location at all. Very disappointing!
4,My soon to be 4 yr old loves it.,"I found this at Toys R Us for only $10. My son loves it. He will be 4 yrs old next month. He loves to spell so we bought this for him. There is two levels and because of his age the first level is above him but it is so easy for him to understand and he knows most of the three letter words so it is good that it is challenging him with 4 and 5 letter words. There is many different activities and levels. We have the Leap Pad version that is OK, but this is so much better. This one recognizes the letters as you draw them, the leap pad one just assumes you drew it correctly. The Leap Pad one only does 3 letter words. This one was a better buy and will grow with your child.Doodle PadPrint LettersCursive LettersSpellingMissing LetterHang ManAdd/ Suband a couple of other things.I highly recommend this for any child who loves to learn or is having trouble."
3,Just okay,Better than the Evenflow brand which I tried first (that one melted in the top rack of the dishwasher and the straw constantly comes undone inside the cup). But this one my 3 and a half year old has a hard time sucking on. She says it's too hard. We then bought the Playtex brand and love it! Definately go with the Playtex brand if you have an older toddler.
1,waste of money,I did not like these cups. I brought them home and rinse them out and filled them with juice and my daughter did not like them and kept asking for juice and everytime I gave her the cup she pushed it away so i tried it and they are kind of hard to get the juice out even thought i pinched the valve like the instructions said and they started leaking all over my couch and i couldn't tell wear it was coming from and i took the lid off and wiped it dry and the cup and it still leaked and not just a little bit there were puddles i would have to wipe dry. I thought they were a bad batch but I have bought the dora big kid cup with the spout and they did the same thing. so apparently they all do it.
3,"Good product, but...","I am long-waisted and the Torso Trim tends to roll up on me. If I stand perfectly still, everything's great, but that doesn't really suit my lifestyle. I'd love to see a long torso model."
3,Sassybax camisole - Provides a definite improvement....,"Nice product which is well made. Personally, I find the camisole lives up to the ""torso trim"" expectation but it doesn't serve as a very well structured ""bra"". I expect it would be wonderful for those of you with a smaller bust who don't need support or shaping though !"
4,Very good online starter book,Good online starter business book. Provides a good foundation. Very easy to read. A very good read for web designers. I highly recommend.
2,Filled with hot air,I thought this book would actually talk about ways you can make money in cyberspace. What a let down. It seems all the book talks about is how great the internet is and its advantages. I already knew the benefits of the internet before I read this book. Stay away from this one.
5,Great summer reading,"This was an engaging story, with engaging characters, in an engaging setting. A great summer read, but readers will enjoy it any time of the year. If you've read any of Hailey North's other books, this is her best yet."
1,Bomb!!,"This book was truly awful. I bought it because the story sounded good, but what should have been included was that Alistair had extra powers and had gray hair and wore sandals....then I would have put this baby right back on the shelf. Sorry, but I like to picture the main-men in books good looking, not a seventies hippie, who owned a magic shop and could cast spells on people. The georgous brother seemed a bit challenged as well.This book lacked total content. The red head, I even forget her name already, could Hailey North have stressed how much of a beautiful body she had anymore? I got to page 70 and said...good bye!Don't waste your time with this one! I will not buy another H.N. book because this totally soured my taste for her writing."
3,Perfect Match,"I liked all the characters. I agree with other reviewers who felt that the heroine, Lauren, was too immature. She and Alistair remind me of the characters who are usually the secondary characters in a book.In attempting to have two full blown romances in one novel, the author tended to get vague in some areas. I can only guess at how old any of the characters were. At times, it was difficult to keep track of the passage of time."
2,blechhhh!,"Sorry this one is NOT a good one. Hailey North is purely a hit or miss author. The last two books I've read of hers have been awful though. I don't think I'll waste any more money on her books. There was another reviewer who expressed my sentiments exactly about the ""hero"", Alistair. Who wants a seventies hippie type hero??? Birkenstocks??? Please! - Yuck! Gray hair? No...sorry...uh uh...not doing anything for me. And Lauren, the ""heroine"", seemed really, really immature. Not to mention airheaded, fickle, frigid, naive, and God knows what all else (but none of it very good). Did I mention immature? So, basically, heroine has nothing going for her but looks, and hero has nothing going for him but money...where does this leave us? Going to bed early, which is NOT a sign of a good book. Spend your money on another author."
3,Need to update,"Full of goodies as far as info goes, but really needs to be updated. Can not be realistically used on a bike, to big and not easily read as you travel. the info will have to be looked at often to get the real use out of it."
2,A little disappointed,"I had expected maps of the road sections and much better pictures. It appears it might be a good reference but not what I was expecting as far as a comprehensive guide to help plan a trip on Rt. 66. I'll keep it but would not make the same mistake of buying it again. Guess I will have to go elsewhere for my ""kicks"""
1,Motorcycle Guide to Historic Route 66,This book is poorly written and only tells tales of some trivial experiences on the road. Could deal with the specific stops outlined and give some advice of experiences that would be useable on the subject.
2,I've returned it,"Says it all, the title. I've returned it to Amazon. Didn't comply with my expectations, full text, no pictures, seemed to be print in a xerox, it was bad! - is a simple as that!"
1,Rehash of Available Data,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this book and discovered that it was basically a compilation of existing data. I have done extensive research on the web for an upcoming trip to explore Route 66 and I was hoping for some new, detailed information from Mr. Woodward's book. What I found was that his detailed route directions certainly appear to be a direct copy of the directions posted for several years on Swa Frantzen's excellent Route 66 website, including some of the typos from the website. In addition, Mr. Woodward includes reprints of articles from the AMA's magazine and some other things I've seen elsewhere.If you lack the time, inclination, or patience to do a little research on your own, or if you're just too lazy to do so, this may be the book for you.Otherwise, don't waste your money."
5,Great Little Pin,"This is a great lapel pin to wear with a sportscoat when you you're going to be around other vets, it really helps as a conversation starter. Recently I went to a convention and I took a sportscoat that I hadn't worn since memorial day, it still had this pin attached to the lapel and I decided to leave it on.I wasn't in the conference for more than 5 minutes when a former marine came over and started a conversation with me, he had on his equivalent marine corps pin...needless to say, I made another friend that day.Overall, this is a nice looking pin that fits nicely on a gentleman's sports coat lapel. Its nicely detailed and looks professional, its my go-to Navy pin and I highly recommend it."
2,New rotor cracked after 3 weeks,"Installed 3 weeks ago, car has been in easy use. I noticed a crack in the outboard surface of the rotor."
5,JAZZ GENIUS AT HIS BEST- A G A I N !!,"This double CD`s set, approved, that Chet Baker, going BETTER AND BETTER , through years.Fantastic performans, and one of the VERY BEST JAZZ ALBUM , E V E R recorded , by anybody.TRULY MASTERPIECE !!!!!!!"
5,Should be in every Baker fan's collection,"I was one of those Chet Baker fans who only bought his early recordings. A few attempts to give his later years a try had me back at the used-CD bin, making a deposit.This Tokyo recording, made in the last year of his life, shows that he still had it...big time. His level of playing seems to be inversely related to his physical appearance of that last year. This ""living ghost"" of Chet sounds strong and clear, lyrical; at times,very fast, and still with that great sense of phrasing. His vocals are surprizingly good.The quality of the sound in this live recording is very good. Also, Harold Danko is outstanding."
4,Don't let the title fool you,"It's called conditioning for weight loss, but it's just an all around nice workout. Here are the things I like about this product:1) The DVD lets you choose from four difficulty levels, or watch them combined. I really liked working my way through the levels so the same workout remained challenging. If I'm having a bad day and am too stiff, I can scale back to a lower level for that day.2) I am a musician and am picky about background music. The Gaiam series of yoga tapes that I've purchased all have pleasant evocative, well performed music that doesn't annoy or distract me, but supports the ambience I'm wanting.3.) I appreciate yoga and the culture that developed it, but I prefer to imbue the experience with my own spirituality, so I appreciate a workout that doesn't push any belief system too heavily.4.) The instructor talks during many of the poses about how the different poses can affect your health. This is interesting and informative."
1,Beware: AM Tape Might Not Work,"I ordered this set, and I was not able to use it because the AM tape does not work in my VCR. I have a relatively new Emerson VCR, and the AM tape didn't work when I tried to play it. There seemed to be a tracking problem that never went away. Thinking it was a defective tape, I had another set sent to me, and the same thing happened. I even tried to contact Gaiam, and they were completely unhelpful."
3,AM & PM Yoga,"AM & PM Yoga is okay, but I like Suzanne Deason's other yoga DVD better. There just isn't a whole lot to the DVD."
4,Great except for one thing..,"This yoga video is great for stretching and toning of the muscles, however, it uses two yoga blocks and a yoga strap. These tools are essential to performing the moves correctly. Too bad it doesn't make that clear as you read about it."
2,too slow,all have to be with the yoga brick or other thingyou have to buy moreit's really slowI want to return it
4,Good for night shift,I have been working nights and was looking for a workout routine that was consitent on the days I work and the days I was off. This is very helpful and has been a great bridge to getting myself into better shape.
4,Fun sheet music,"Always fun to play Bill Evans sheet music, including this one,,this exact note to note from,, records : You must believe in spring, I will say goodbye, Since we meet (& others).Try 'But Beautiful' from stunning 'Since we meet' album,, Seascape. One of best Jazz sheet music."
4,Just got this -- some initial problems,"The R-09 recorded great for an hour, then I started having serious problems turning the power on and off. The screen would freeze, or the recorder simply wouldn't turn on. I downloaded the latest firmware update (if I'm using that word correctly), and that seems to have fixed the problem. Hopefully it won't recur.It's about the same size as a deck of cards, and about the same weight. You could easily stick it in the front pocket of your pants. Not having to plug in a microphone if you don't want to is great. The internal unidirectional mic sounds very good.The battery door does seem to be rather badly designed. You have to apply some force to open and close it, and it feels like it might break. You have to open the door not only to replace the batteries, but also to plug in the USB cable (though you only have to open it part way).Dumping audio files to my laptop over USB worked fine."
4,Great - all but the case,"What's inside the case works great, and the product is easy to use.The only real criticism I have of this product shouldn't affect anyone's buying decision if you're looking for a compact, easy to use, good little sound recorder with great features. Hence 4 stars, not 5.This review has two purposes: a warning to the user, and a strong suggestion to the manufacturer to revise the case design.The first time I pulled the DC power plug out of the unit, the Edirol flew apart in my hands, sending two small plastic pieces flying in different directions. It took my clever wife a half hour to put the unit back together again.Caution: pull out the DC plug slowly, gently, and carefully!Really, Edirol, you have to fix this. There are a lot of examples out there of robust case design for little electronic devices like this one. This product is way too good to be marred by such a bad case design."
4,Cool Little Recorder,"This seems to be the recorder that everyone has in acoustic music. We use to all have the Sony minidisc, but it is a pain to use and you could never get it right. This is so easy. Just push the on button and hit the record button, adjust the levels if needed and hit the record button again and away you go. Still experiemting with the different quality of recording you can do, but it is easy to change. Sound quality is good. Even at a distance, like on the floor it will still pickup. Easy to plug in and copy to the computer, comes right into itunes or Audicity. Lightweight. Look cool"
5,Handy and versatile,The balance of portability and quality is fantastic. The menu interface is reasonably intuitive and sufficiently user friendly given the small profile. It's very nice being able to capture spontaneous ideas with minimal overhead.
5,My brief experience with Edirol R-09,"Edirol R-09 WAVE/MP3 Recorder, BlackThis is not a technical review. Just my experience with the device.A sleek device. Can be carried anywhere with ease. Recording quality thru the microphone or line in is good. The built-in microphone/s are very sensitive-pick up every sound around. Capable of Recording in both MP3 and WAV formats. Records on to an SD Card(2GB Maximum)It has been useful for me in converting my cassettte tapes into MP3 format and then transferring it to my computer thru the provided USB cable. Works perfectly fine.2 AA batteries last about 3 1/2-4 hours with continuous recording.Of course, changing the batteries requires care.Price: appears to be expensive. Considering its size, weight and capabilities, it may be worth the cost."
4,Edirol good deal,"The Edirol R-09 is lightweight and silent. You need a 2gig card, so add that expense to the bill. The weakness is the battery access door which is flimsy, but not that difficult to manage."
5,top notch,"totally awesome product with best sound imaginable - my daughter uses it for both voice, violin, and group music recordings. All sound great"
5,REALLY HANDY,"RECORDS GREAT.THE NEW OPERATING SYSTEM WILL USE A 4 GB CLASS 2 SD CARD.GREAT FOR REHEARSALS ,TALKS ETC. JUST PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET OR GIG BAG AND GO...."
4,Questions,"Reading all the wonderful reviews, I've decided to get a Edirol R-09. However, can someone tell me besides getting the Edirol R-09 Recorder, what else do I need to get for recording music and transfer it to the computer and become mp3 file? (like usb, or mic....) Please specify the product and brand name. THanks a million!"
5,Excellent preliminary results,"I have tried to record my piano playing so many times over the years with disappointing results. Also, I am very average when it comes to dealing with electronics. That said, I highly recommend this for home recording. I have a very nice piano (Yamaha C-7) and it is in tune. Reading the instructions took about an hour. When I finished, I said to myself -- ""It works just like a typical tape player."" I had expected some electronic rigmarole, but there was none. We have a good microphone, but I chose to use the internal mic. Turned it on, played for about five minutes and did a playback through headphones. It captured the sound perfectly, no strange echoes, nothing. Wow. That was simple.If you order one of these, you'll want to order a couple of 2GB or 4GB memory cards also. I was recording at the high end and the card that comes with the device only lasts for five minutes or so."
3,Hmm,"Mixed feelings about the R-09 four months after buying from Amazon. First, it came with dated software. I suppose this is the way things go with modern electronic devices. But you may have update your r-09 via your home PC. It was not that easy: I managed to get the 1.31 software downloaded with help from a friend who has an R-09. My unit shipped in 6/08; 1.31 was released by Roland in 9/07. Without the update, my unit wouldn't accept a 4 gig card. Haven't tried an 8 gig. I use the r-09 to record live music. You may want to set the r-09 to record in mp-3 format, as wave takes alot of memory. A four gig card will only last a few hours. The r-09 generally works well. I've been careful with the back hinge after reading all the reviews. Currently my r-09 isn't recording -- something's wrong with it. Still haven't figured out a good audio program to edit r-09 recordings on the PC. Had used goldwave previously."
4,A major talent,"It takes someone special to pull me out of my old school groove, and this is just the guy. Mr. Richardson has some serious vocal pipes, never out of tune. In addition the songwriting and production are excellent here.Loved the intro to ""Keep On Pushing"" kind of reminiscent of Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Going to Come."" While I believe the first song is the highlight of the album, the second song, ""Fallin' Out"" is also top notch. The first seven are quite good, especially ""More Than a Woman"" which I first heard on a couple of soundtracks ... so glad it's on this album. The CD tails off a little near the end, but finishes on a high note.I'm glad I discovered Mr. Richardson and hope he continues to shine."
5,good cd,"this is a good cd there are alot of good songs on here. this cd is full of songs that make you feel something. my favorites are keep on pushin, not like this and your love is. this is a very good cd and i recommend it to any r&b fan. i think calvin richardson is a good artist and i hope he has a long and successful career"
3,Pretty Good,"Thought that Calvin's strong vocals would have been better complimented by more punchy tracks. ""Keep on Pushing"" is awesome, and ""More than a Woman"" is great. The rest of album dragged for me."
5,"A So, So, Soulful Man","this is the best Cd I heard in a long, long time. the entire Cd seems as if it was made for me. 2:35p.m., the title just opened my eyes. I love the entire Cd but my two favorite songs are ""Falling Out"" & ""Your Love Is"". His fist album ""Country Boy"", which was made in 1999 was also fabulous. he is such a great artist but he needs more television appearances. words cannot described, explained(however you want to put it)the power in his soulful and sexy voice. Yall betta check him out and get 2:35p.m., before they all get gone."
5,Absolutely Ridiculous!,"Can you remember the last time you picked up a cd and every cut on there was tight? I can't. That is, until I heard Calvin Richardson's 2:35pm. This cd is absolutely ridiculous! I'ts ridiculous that every song on here is hott! It's ridiculous that he has brought back to RnB what others have taken away: the soul and heart of it. When I heard this cd, I just had to buy it (and I don't know when the last time I bought a cd was) b/c every song on here caught my attention. Bottom line: the brother can sang! This cd is a must have and it possesses what I've been wanting out of all of these RnB artists for so long...real RnB."
5,The boy can BLOW...,"I am so impressed w/ Calvin. I wasn't really up on game when it came to him. I saw his videos and thought, oh another R&B dude, trying to sing to the ladies. But oh my goodness. I was stumped when I saw the movie ""Deliver us from Eva"" and heard his song ""More than a woman"" in the background. I thought, dag, that is a hot song. And who is singing that!? I immediately went online and found it was him. I listened to a couple of samples and took a chance on him, and WOW! I love his voice. When he sings, I find myself nodding my head saying, ""Sing boy!"" One can tell if the artist trully feels what their singing. And I really admire that about him. He draws you into his story. You've got to give him a chance. He's mad talented. And under played. As always, this is one for the archives!"
2,Nothing New Here,"I listened to this CD over and over and over and over again trying to find a reason to like it. The truth of the matter is that this is not a bad CD its just cookie cutter of everything else out there.I like one song (""Put My Money On You"")on the CD and 2 if you count (""More Than A Woman""). Artist have to feel that they want to get away from the Drum Machines and use acoustical instruments.Maybe its me and I need to listen to it again. Maybe I am being hard on artist today for using drum machines over and over again."
2,Echoing Sam Cooke&R.Kelly but not there fully,I can Hear a Sam Cooke&R.Kelly Influence coming through but overall He ain't there yet&He has alot going on in the Arrangements that bog down the Album.it's deeper than it needs to be.He has Talent but not the right songs to fully enhance His thing yet.
4,Looks are like struttin' but contents are much more intelligent,"This is a great soul output, there are really the kind of chords I like to hear in soul music. There are a lot of guitars (sometimes real, sometimes machine): smooth electric and acoustic too. Raphael Saadiq is also in the pot, check out the linear notes. The music is not that shadowy and jazzy as Dwele's but it really has depth. The first track is quite similar to Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" which you can check out on Leela James' debut. I don't care much about it, I like both ""versions""."
5,My favorite hand saw,"Very utilitarian. I saw finished wood, prune trees, large limbs that fall during wind storms. Love it! Use it! Seems very durable and feels expensive."
4,An improvement over the first,"I liked the first book well enough. You can't really go wrong with the standard fantasy formula of the under-dog hero with unrealized special powers and over-the-top antagonist. The Mistborn trilogy did it well, heck even Star Wars and Harry Potter used the same formula.The second book picks up the pace a bit with the hero growing into some of his powers and the bad guy beginning to reveal himself and really take shape. There is still more than a fair bit of skulking about and whining by the hero but he offsets this by some pretty great feats of bravery.The writing continues to impress me and the characters (while sometimes more charicture than character) are very intriguing."
5,Farseer Trillagy,"In a land and time far far away,live Fritz the bastard. How I love this boy. His soul is pure. His values honest. His wolf sincere. The dialog is of the time and period and got me hooked right away. The imagery haunts me in my sleep, yet I do not have the Skill although I sometime feel I have the Wit connection with my cat. These books are a delightful read. A great way to escape!"
5,One of the best books of all time!!!!!,"People complain that Fitz makes stupid mistakes and keeps getting himself deeper into his problems. What would you expect?! That he automatically does what is right? It doesn't happen so in the real life, so why would it happen so in this book? I think that Fitz is much more interesting character, becouse of his mistakes. It's boring to read of someone, who always does what is right!"
4,It's nice to read a book when the Good guys suffer sometime!,"Ms Hobbs continues to amaze me with were she's going with Fitz and this tale. I'm committed now to see this out to the end in the ""Asses Quest"" book 3. Without Burrich, Chade, or the Fool, Young Fitz would no doubt be truly dead long by now. He has so much potential but can be pretty stupid at times (many times). Makes for an unlikely hero which is o.k. by me. Royal Ass is an excellent follow-up to Ass apprentice. Enjoy!"
2,"Good plot, not so great story or writing","I loved the plot. The concept is excellent, the writing is okay, but the story, in particular the character interaction, leaves much to be desired. I finished it because I wanted to know what happened to the characters, so obviously there's some worth to it. But I really had to force myself to finish the book, and only my interest in the outcome kept me going. I'm not sure what's wrong with it. The characters are interesting, not two dimensional, but they simply couldn't hold my interest."
3,Good Read BUT.......,This guy never stops suffering and being hurt and miserable. It continues through the entire series. Eventually you just start to lose interest.
4,Gloomy but Amazing!,"At times during this book I felt it deserved 3 stars, while at other times I was sure it needed 5.I will not lie to you; this is the most depressing book I have read yet. The ending of this book and the beginning of the next leave you with an absolutely distraught feeling as though all the life force has been sucked out of you - but do not let that distract you! The writing is amazing and the story is good (not as solid as the first book but still a good story). I felt there was a lot of superfluous information in this second series of the farseer saga, but overall I think it was a really good read. I was so sucked into the story I could scarce devote time to much else.A disturbingly heart-shattering book expertly written and cleverly seductive. I say its definitely worth 4 stars!"
1,Worst Series Ever,"If you're a happy person, and enjoy life, this series will make you want to kill yourself. Slowly. Painfully. I literally burned my books and was violent with rage after reading this series."
3,This is where it gets annoying,This whole series would have been cut totally short if one critical thing had been done right from the beginning. Here on end it gets really annoying.
2,Politics in fantasy shouldn't be like this,"I thought Assasins apprentice was an OK book, so I started reading this one aswell. In assasins apprentice Fitz is trained in the arts of the assasin, and is also involed in the inner fight betweem the two princes. I assumed that in this book, Fitz would get a quest, to kill someone important or something like that. But the book is really only about politics at the court. Fitz does do some assasination, but these are only told of briefly. All in all a boring book that is not worth reading, you will only get irritated at the extremly slow pace and boring plot."
4,Good Bridge into Third Book,"As with the first book in the series, this book is very well written and I love the characters. Finally we get a taste of what is to come with the red ships and the wit. Again the theme of the story is sacrifice. Where the first book was nearly stand-alone from beginning to end (save the red ships), this book is clearly relying on the third to tie up all the loose ends."
4,"good writer, story could be better","Without a doubt, Robin Hobb is a great writer. She made me feel the events and emotions that were portrayed in this book. I couldn't put it down, and yet I was not happy with the way the story was going. I think it takes a great writer to do that. The ending depressed me, but it certainly left me wanting more."
3,Mildly engaging,Mediocre I would say.When I started the book I had quite high expectations according to what the reviewers had been saying and in all sense I hadn't been totally disappointed. The characters were well thought out and interesting but something was lacking. The whole book didn't really seem to go anywhere. It basically started off almost where it ended. I will but the next installment out of curiosity because the ending was interesting and left you waiting for more and books have been known to improve from book to book.
4,Good book 2 of trilogy,Hobb continues book two of the trilogy with good storytelling. I found myself speeding through this book because I wanted to know what happens next. The plot gets thicker and the characters get more complex and Hobb doesn't beat around the bush with pages that don't contribute to the story except to act as a filler.
1,How many times can someone be beaten?,"A waste of time. I made it through Assassin's Apprentice, a bit leary of continuing because the main character seems to have no sense at all, other than the wit. He's supposed to have great skilling powers, yet seems continually ignorant of how to use them.It a shame because I think the author can write but is too into a masochistic need to have his character continually beaten and humiliated. Then I come to the end of the book and it's like ""it was all a dream"" kind of ending. Nothing mattered. All that time spent with Burrick, Chade, Verity, way more interesting than the main character, wasted."
3,its ok,this book is ok it kind of takes a while to get through but i liked it in a sense the plot thickens towards the end and turns up to be a decent ending.
2,tedious,"Although a competetantly written, the story lacks tension and drive besides the gray tedium of portending doom. One can only be doomed for so long before one wants just to end it all, and I did, by closing the book."
5,Royal Assassin,Hobb does an excellent job of further expanding the character/personality of Fitz in a complex plot of intrigue. Great read.
4,Robin Hobb holds me spellbound.,I truly did not want to stop reading this book. Hobb continues her Farseer series and draws me into her universe easily--and lets me reelish every second of it.
2,Not nearly as good as the first,"I absolutely loved the first book of this series. So much so, perhaps my expectations were too high for the 2nd... regardless, I have tried to finish it several times but have been unsuccessful. I keep putting it down. It's not terrible, but given the author constructed such interesting characters and a fascinating world, it's a shame that this book doesn't dare to go further.I really wanted to like this one."
