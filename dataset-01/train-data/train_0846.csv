1,Lacking too much detail,In an effort to simplify the map many smaller centers and infrastructure details are omitted. However the worst offence is that only the most basic details are shown for the surrounding countries. For example apparently Vietnam only has three roads and 4 cities according to this map. So if your travels will take you over the border you will need another map.
2,Huge letdown,"My family and I just returned from a week-long cruise up the inside passage of Alaska, and had a wonderful time--it was SO beautiful! A few days after our return I saw this DVD at Sam's Club and bought it. Watching it was a major letdown. As one reviewer has pointed out, it really did seem like a film you would see in a local museum, plus part of the film seem to have the tone of, ""Native people good, white man bad"". Don't waste your money on this---like I did."
4,Great videography,"Even though I own property in Alaska, near Anchor Point, I have yet had the privilige of exploring the Inside Passage. This would be a great reference product for someone thinking about visiting the Inside Passage. The commentary and videography are excellent."
2,"this was not your best, usher",i think pop ya collar was a big surprise because it [stinks]. i love usher but he could have done better with this song.
5,It Just Gets Better With Time,"It Just Gets Better With Time by Maseyree was a no can put down type of a novel. The writer kept me interested and kept me engaged in the reading. It was really hard for me to put the book down. The writer is obviously a very gifted talent and I cannot wait to explore her next no can put down read. I was excited to read the book and after I finished reading it, I was left feeling somewhat sad because I wanted the story to go on forever. Please keep me abreast of her new books when they come out.Thanks,Jacquelyn T. Cartwright"
5,DEFINITELY A MUST READ,"I completed your book last night. I stayed up until 1am. It was absolutely wonderful! I want MORE MORE MORE! I really wanted more at the end so I know that you must me working on a sequel. I have so many questions. I must say that I did have a moment when I cried and that was when Andrea gave in to Rae Jae, damn I didn't want to see her degrade her self like that to get high. That really was upsetting and I think I came to the realization that there are teenage girls out here really going through this type of thing. It makes me want to get in the community and reach out to these girls. So you see, this novel has put a lot on my head and this MUST be one of GAAL Book Club's monthly selections definitely. Hopefully, I can look forward to a sequel."
5,A true page turner!!!,"It is difficult to believe this book is this author's first novel. The characters are rich, the book flows from page to page. You'll be hooked from the first page!!"
4,A testament of faith,"Two sisters, two VERY different lives...or so it seems. One sister lives in the projects; the other a nice spread. One sister is just scraping by; the other is rich. But they both have problems that will equalize their pain.Maseyree's debut novel takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride--one day the main character looks like she'll get ahead, the next she been pushed back 10 paces. A-go-ni-zing! I was yelling into the book at one point to give her the heads up on what was going on around her! In the end, you realize that family and faith take you a long ways down the road..."
3,"Interesting plot, great characters, but need more action","I enjoyed the plot, the intricate development of the characters (particularly Richard and Harry), and the excellent descriptions of most scenes. I would have liked more action, or at least a more consistent flow of action throughout the book."
4,Intriguing and intelligent story,"This story has an intelligent plot and is a good read. There were five or six interesting twists that made it that much more complex, unexpected and intriguing. I also enjoyed the way the author blended the ""espionage"" portion of the plot with a more profound clash of ideas and political turmoil facing the Middle East and other key questions that the novel brings to light. I look forward to reading another novel by this author."
5,Kill three birds with one powerful stone...,"I bought the book directly from the author, which gave me a chance to hear his ideas regarding the novel. And after I read it, I realized how well he has packaged three themes into one powerful book: a Middle East conspiracy to rid Israel of weapons of mass destruction; elaborate undertakings in counter-intelligence operations; and the conflicting moral/ethical attitudes of insiders and outsiders in the espionage arena. Of course, these themes are carried through the novel using a variety of literary vehicles, such as the stolen paintings of a famous Egyption artist; a love triangle between the FBI agent, the suspect, and her sister; the gamesmanship and macabre dealings of Mossad agents and other savvy ""professionals""; and other potent characters and scenes. And having chatted with the author, I tend to think he extensively researched the substance of his novel--perhaps more than most fiction writers. I recommend reading this book."
4,"Suspenseful, entertaining story... Holds your attention","The plot builds up slowly, in part through a series of flashbacks -- cleverly done, I might add. But it's hard to follow if you put the book down for more than a day -- there are a lot of complex clues, some of them disguised in trivial ways. I found the characters interesting too, which made the book an enjoyable read. Unfortunately, I wasn't quite as fulfilled with the ending -- I was hoping for an explosive, action-packed finale. I recommend the book, but don't get all worked up for a splashy ending."
4,"Oustanding, clever mystery!","I briefly met the author last year, and finally read the book over the holidays. Awesome plot for sure. Excellent characters, though I would never want to meet a real Sara--a bizarre, cold woman whose sole goals in life are to create illusions of herself and seek revenge. BUT she's perfect for the story. Nash, on the other hand, is suave, driven, warm, and, to his fault, crazy about this elusive woman who can't possibly love him. And he's incredibly naive about the way the FBI used him. And I like the author's humor. But most remarkably, Frieden portrays the bad guys (and gals) in the best way possible for a novel of this genre: by leaving the reader guessing about who holds the moral high ground."
4,"masterful plot , remarkable characters","Frieden's depiction of the lead character, Nash and his hunt for the lost love of his life (Sara) is remarkable. Caught in a secret and extremely sensitive international espionage plan, the lead character finds himself enthralled in a desparate and profoundly complex international dilemma. This thrilling novel captivates the reader's curiosity from the first page, and magnificently captures the drama of his heart-wrenching search for Sara, while against all odds."
1,"Item was DAMAGED, BEWARE BUYERS!!!!!!","Did Amazon have a FIRE SALE??? The box had a funny smell and when I opened it the board game was completely WARPED and DISTORTED. Plus, it had MOLD growing on the board. How can you play a board game when the pieces fall off the warped board which is bent like a DOME??? Plus, the board folds up so many times, I can see it will break if I try to flatten it.Did you have a WATER LEAK in your storage room??? Beware of Damaged goods. The game may be educational but with the smell of mold, who can play the game????"
5,Smath is fun!,"To A Toy Enthusiast from Iowa:How can you be college educated and not understand this game? I don't understand.I am writing to Pressman and asking them to make 'SCalculus and 'SGeometry... that would be fun.'Smath is fun for all ages, not just 6-12 year olds. It is extremely durable, I've had mine for about 15 years or so, and I still love to play, and it's held up."
2,okay to play once or twice,"Scrabble is endlessly interesting, because it just keepsgetting more advanced as your abilities increase. Thesame is not true of 'Smath. The number of differentoperations is necessarily very limited, so the challengeis not very interesting. I'd recommend this game for aclassroom, where many kids can enjoy it once or twice,but not for playing for fun."
4,No contest for GED students,"OK, I'm accually 18 using this Kiddy review cause its free, but still, to any college educated person how could you not like this game. I mean come-on people, I've been in some college classes where the students still play this awesome game. It is a challenge to race the younger math wizs in filling out the board. My GED class complains about the speed at which opportunity to make an equation is quickly decreasing, we still love it."
3,Bette Davis Eyes,"alright.. maybe I just like this because I love bette davis... but if your into techno electroclashish dancing music.. this is a really fun CD, its what i would call a guilty pleasure.. you can dance around your room when your home alone and have lots of fun... that alone is worth buying this CD!"
3,my favorite part was the whole thing,it was such a perfect one that i had to see it another time at least. to get everything since it was a different language it took many days to learn it all what they were doing.THANK YOU FOR THE FILM! ALL I LOVE IN A FILM!i hope for a sequal very soon! congrats to the director and his family! please spread the word about this magnifecence film!
5,This should have been the future...,"I read this book when I was in high school. It was in a stack of new arrivals at the library and I was intrigued by the cover. I remember begging the librarian to please process the book so I could check it out and read it over the weekend.The scope and breadth of this vision of the future seemed so attainable. Giant farms in the sky, habitats housing millions, gigawatt power satellites and other industries were all well thought out. Even as to the employment of the shuttle in setting up some of this infrastructure. Reading this book again was nostalgic for me. Not for what I remember, but for the feeling of hope that we all had for the space program in those days.For anyone who wants to get in touch with how we dared to hope and dream, this book is a must-read!"
3,A disappointing film journey,"Whatever happened to Egoyan's intensity? I was crazy about The Adjuster, and told everyone in my world about it . Exotica was a great story. Then, ""Hereafter"" left me puzzled. Now, I won't even recommend Felicia's Journey to anyone. Read the other reviews that perfectly describe the faults of this film. I can't write anything else about how bummed I was about viewing this film. I'm an Egoyan fan bordering on ignoring the rest of his projects."
1,"Disturbing, Stupid, AVOID!!","Okay let's see, a girl goes across sea to find her boyfriend, meets an older man while walking on the street, then get's in his car and let's him drive her across town after only meeting him once before, then STAY'S with him at his home and not only that she let's him take her to get an ABORTIAN so he can kill her. She obviously doesn't know he's planning to kill her, but how smart can you be in the first place to trust someone that much after only meeting them once or twice before. I'm sorry, but after the abortian that's when the movie got to disturbing and ended for me, I couldn't stand watching another minute. Not only that, but it was slow and boring. I was expecting a thriller, but instead I just ended up waisting my time. Avoid this movie, don't waist $3."
3,A not so sweet hereafter,"Atom Egoyan followed up his masterpiece film ""The Sweet Hereafter,"" with this strange movie about an unusual serial killer. Bob Hoskins gives a great performance as the man whose hobbies are gormet cooking and killing young girls. But he doesn't murder them outright, as young Felica discovers. She's come to his town seeking out the boyfriend who left her. With nowehere to go, she seemingly lucks out when Hoskins offers to allow her to stay at his large house. All of this sounds more intriguing than it ends up being on the screen. Though well acted, the movie moves slowly and ultimately just doesn't amount to all that much. Egoyan's movies are always literate, but this one is so to the point that you start to lose interest. There are no great moving moments like in ""The Sweet Hereafter."""
2,Be warned . . .,"As a latecomer to Atom Egoyan's oevre, I was blown away by 'Exotica' back in '94 - I was into Hal Hartley, Luis Bunuel and Peter Greenaway at the time. I tried to seek out his other stuff while globe-trotting, with little success. I found 'The Sweet Hereafter' powerful, but much more straightforward, than 'Exotica', and thus somehow less satisfying.'Felicia's Journey' is arguably a step in the wrong direction - less obtuse than his previous works, it lacks menace, substance, passion. I am not a big fan of Bob Hoskins in the first place, and I did not find his performance convincing here.If you want to watch something creepy but intelligent, I recommmend Todd Solonz' 'Happiness', 'Pi', or Egoyan's truly mind-blowing 'Exotica'. I would give this a wide berth, unless you are a huge Bob Hoskins fan, and/or of an extremely undiscriminating disposition."
4,Nice Glasses,bought for my wife as a Christmas present to replace her original pair. Excellent that Costa has and keeps identical styles so you can maintain your look.... Lenses are plastic so keep them in a case when in your (wife's) purse.
2,Not the reissue,"What I received was the original recording, not the Japanese reissue as stated in the description. The sound quality is pretty bad. I'd contact seller to be sure you get what the description says."
3,LOST IN THE ROCK JUNGLE,"Underated UK band scored a bit in NE US in early-mid 70's. Those uninitiated should think Caravan/Tull. Whimsical and symphonic, their off beat submissions are neither good or bad; just easy on the ears and endlessly lstenable. Hmm!"
1,not their best,"As mentioned elsewhere, this album is certainlyan acquired taste. What comes off most stronglyis complexity for its own sake and not having anyreal organic basis. This was the only cd of theirsI didn't hang onto."
4,TRY TO FIND EUROPEAN RELEASE,"This is one of the best GG albums. But my advice - try to find a european release (e.g. German). Why ? This is NOT the original cover ! The original is done by no-one but Roger Dean ! Remember Uriah Heep's covers of their halcyon days, or YES covers, or ASIA ? Very beautiful octopus should have been. The same refers to THREE FRIENDS album. The american release simply repeats the cover of GG first album but this is not the original drawing. Thank Gog the sequence of tracks remain intact."
4,Gently filling giant shoes,"The band continued to refine an already highly eccentric sound, emphasizing fast, quirky pianistic interplay and articulate vocal sculpting over the receding guitar-rock influence. The results may feel more obnoxious then their first two releases but in fact reveal a sound that much more oddly complete, an album to truly mark GG's distinction within the progressive community."
4,Strangely Rocking,"Definitely an acquired taste, this progressive rock blast from the past is topheavy with virtuosic albeit idiosyncratic vocal and instrumental performances by one of the quintessential bands of its era. This is a recording that requires at least three or four intent listens before you've really heard it. This is not a record for casual listening. There are multiple layers of sound, bizarre time signatures and unconventional instrumentation and play techniques. For those whose tastes are limited to the ever-present blues rock and heavy metal of the day, this is NOT your record. If your mind and your ears are open and your tastes are somewhat eclectic and aren't limited to vanilla, it might be right up your alley, but this is definitely a ""Not for use by the general public"" kind of record."
2,OPT FOR THE REPERTOIRE,"In 2006, Repertoire released a wonderfulremasterof this fabulous album. It was also in a mini-LP-sleeve jacket, but the art has been nicely updated by Roger Dean and featured a gorgeous glossy finish. Not an accurate replica of the original LP jacket, but extremely nice nonetheless.When this 2008 Japan SHM-CD mini-sleeve, with a new remaster, was announced, I pre-ordered it, thinking it would possibly be even better than the Repertoire.Not so. Upon arrival and performing an A/B comparison, the Repertoire blows this Japan version out of the water. The Japan disc sounds muffled in comparison; the difference between the two is not trivial.The Repertoire was also a limited edition, and is now OOP, but there are a few copies left here on Amazon for sale, as of this writing. If you want the best-sounding version of this recording, grab the Repertoire before it's totally gone."
5,A Great Chapter in the He-man Saga.,this is a wonderful chapter in the he-man saga i just loved this film. if don't already own the so called best of she-ra then i would get this. to explore more of he-man adventures with she-ra . it's got great animation that they don't do anymore and it comes with a positive message .Highly Recommended for the honor and power of grayskull in all of us.
2,Movie rip-off,Do not buy this movie. I am a HE-MAN and SHE-RA fan and when I found out that this movie is really just the episodes 1-5 on season 1 VOL 1 of SHE-RA I was very disapointed. I already have season 1 vol 1 of SHE-RA and was looking for more storyline behind the powers of HE-MAN and SHE-RA but was left disappointed.
3,Stick with the 1934 version!,"Disney version of the Stevenson pirate yarn.Not as faithful to the novel as the 1934 version, with baffling changes made throughout, including the ending.Thought Wallace Beery made a much better Long John Silver than some actor named Newton.Seemed like another Disney whitewash job.The only plus is that this version is in color.The story of the search for buried treasure, Bobby Driscoll plays a passable Jim Hawkins.For those wishing a faithful version of the Stevenson story, however, stick with Wallace Beery, Lionel Barrymore, and Jackie Cooper!"
2,Girl G-Shocks suck.,"Like I said in my other review for girl G-shocks, they all seem to suck. Plastic pieces eventually age and brake off. Never had them last when I get them for my daughters. The one's made for guys are super tough, and I've never had one brake on me. The ones made for girls are really crappy."
2,small review on the DVD,"I have only watched this DVD on computer so the resolution was not great.I believe that the DVD was not very professionally done. The interviews looked like it was done by ameteurs.The slow motion playback was in really bad resolution.the game itself was OK, not something very outstanding."
1,Wrong DVD,"Ey, the reference (ASIN: B0000TG9EM) is wrong and actually refers not to Jenks ""Tex"" Carman At Town Hall Party but to Town Hall Party November 6, 1954.Beware or you will end with the wrong DVD (happened to me)"
5,Teaching Kids About Easter in a Fun and Relvant Way!,"I bought these eggs for my children last year to give them a hands-on way to learn more about the Easter story. Both girls loved them and ask to do them again throughout the year. I was suprised when I told to my younger daughter (now age 4) a few weeks ago that Easter was coming up, that she immediately brought up these eggs. She also remembered much of the story! My 10 year old also enjoys these. Sometimes I find them at the kitchen table, my older one reading the story and the younger one playing with the trinkets from the eggs while listening intently. Amazing! This year I am buying them for friends' kids."
1,Very misguided,"This author does not appear to know the true God. These are personal beliefs written in the form of fiction. There is no scriptural basis, and the story is so against what the bible has said re: Lucifer, it is obvious she has not done any study ofher subject matter. For any reader who has not studied the bible or God, this is true fiction, and should in no way be considered a true representation of God or Satan."
5,Guide to finding the reputable needle in a haystack.,"Sorting through all the extravagant theories of who killed JFK can become highly frustrating for the Kennedy enthusiast. So many wild ideas have circulated through our modern culture, most evident in Oliver Stone's JFK, that it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between possible truth and well conceived fiction. William Scott's new Reference Guide does just this for both the serious researcher and the interested hobbyist. Only the most reliable and historically accurate sources have been included in this research guide, so no longer does the JFK assassination enthusiast have to sort through the wild theories to discover the respectable facts. A must have for anyone serious about their research."
5,A Must For Early Readers,"Finding chapter books for young readers ( 4-6 years ) that they are able to read themselves with ease are very hard to find. I am an owner, director, and master elementary teacher of a small private school. I spend many hours looking for books that do not use put-downs, rude retorts, words like ""stupid/idiot/baby"", cliques and competition in a negative way, as part of the story line. Books of this type are very hard to find, and ones that will hold a child's interest are even harder to find. The ""Nate the Great"" series meets my qualifications, enough so that I am buying the series for my young grandson for Christmas."
4,A fascinating relic,"It's good to see this book back in print. The apartheid era might seem like the distant past, but it wasn't so long ago that so many people were knee-deep in this issue - and so many South Africans were suffering and dying.South Africa today could have used a leader like Steve Biko. His writings show him to be a man of great intelligence, and the accompanying essay by Father Stubbs shows Biko to be a leader of great charisma. Read this book and you'll see what the world lost when Biko was slain."
4,the book is very inspiring,"the author has very ingeniuosly described the history of black people(during the apartheid regime), and gives one(historically disadvantaged people) a reason to wake up each morning with black conscious mind."
3,small but nice,I was disappointed in the size but not the quality. It is well constructed and colorfull. The cost caught my eye but the S&H wasn't such a good deal.
2,"Same item #, different plug configuration",The part # 40-5940 represents two different Toro switches. The plug-in blades are positioned differently on each. Also one is slightly longer than the other so that it does not fit.
4,It's pretty good,If you like good hardcore bands then you will like these guys. They have some pretty good breakdowns and descent musicianship. Worth buying.
4,Brilliant!,"Intriguing and FAB! with a twist at the end that you wouldn't expect (from one that usually works out ""the go"" in the first two chapters! Buy it, give yourself a great read, Lisa"
4,Not Your Normal Teenage Girl,"Ruth Rendell is a master at developing the strangest, but totally believable family drama situations from compelling and believable characters. This story features an anorexic, serial killer teenager who has an unhealthy love interest in her father. She eventually grows out the anorexia, as well as the crush, but there are a number of bodies left in her wake. Did she really kill these people? Twisty to the end, Heartstones is a short, sweet read, almost like a bedtime story for those with a wickedly dysfunctional appetite."
2,"Good prose. Otherwise, no redeeming value.","Allocating 4 points to plot and 3 each to characters and prose, this one gets a 3. No memorable characters and no plot and no ending. Save your time."
2,"good idea, bad design","good idea, tongs were made from solid construction but the handle doesnt close all the way and my hands (or the normal human hand) isnt big enough to open the tongs wide enough to pick up a crab because of the amount of space between the handles when the tongs are completely closed. the handle does not completely close"
1,Missing dust jacket,"While I understand used books are often missing dust jackets, that information is often very important to the buyer. Nowhere in the description did I read that the dust jacket was missing."
1,Product didnt fit - Returned it.,"This part number is correct, and the part I recieved is correct, but the filter itself is molded wrong for the 2005 Triumph Sprint ST it was meant to go in. Had to return it and just bought an OEM filter instead.From reading around this is a common issue for the K&N; filter for Triumphs. So beware!Amazon was great to work with on the return."
2,Material not so great,This item did not really work that well for sweating. It had a nice feel but did not fell like it was drying out well. I don't think it was wiking out well. Almost felt like it was trapping heat.
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this item for an upcoming cycling event. It seems to be a nice enough product that will keep sweat out of the eyes etc. The reason for the negative review is that the picture advertising the wrap is not the same as the item shipped. Note the picture is an all black wrap. The item they shipped me is a purple head wrap with lightning bolts i.e. ""brainstorm"". I should have realized by the name, but I go by the picture advertising the item. If you want a purple wrap with lightning bolts I suppose this would be a satisfactory product."
2,tight at the toes,"Well, since it's high heeled, I had to order a size smaller. This one in particular presses down on my toes from all directions, making it painful for the tip of my toes when I walk. It looks great, but I can hardly call it a comfortable pair of work shoes unless you have narrow feet, maybe?"
2,Incomplete,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about the breed and their special needs. However only the first half of the book was breed specific. The shopping lists and breed history was interesting, but I still have many unanswered questions about basic care. The second half had basic training tips that applies to all breeds. This may be a good book for someone who is looking for a general overview of the breed, but if you're looking for a detailed manual about how to care for and train a puppy, adult, and senior Boston Terrier, this book isn't it."
1,Not very scholarly,"Although this book gives an interesting snapshot of the state of Korea during the 1890's, I found the perspective to be a bit dated. Bird is a layperson describing events and accordingly provides a superficial account of Koream events. This is also a perspective of a Victorian lady with all the prejudices of that bygone era. The book is amusing from that perspective and is more like a novel; but it is hardly a scientic or sholarly study--if you are looking for a more scholarly work in your study of Korea and its history at this time you might instead look to more a recently published work and written from someone with appropriate educational background and training.Accordingly, this book should be read with a grain of salt as it is written by a layperson with all prejudices of a bygone Victorian era. It is hardly historical. It is perhaps like reading WWII American accounts of the Japanese empire and its people and taking that as the historical perspective."
3,How to make a 40 foot flop!,"This is the making of the 1976 remake of the 1933 classic King Kong.A monumental, money-eating flop, maybe, but an interesting ""making of"" all the same.From malfunctioning mechanics to illiterate Italians bound on squandering as much of the green as possible to make their vision a reality, this book has it all.Why remake a classic (though in modern terms a little cheesy looking) that has spanned decades and stood the test of time, at least in the eyes of movie buffs?Who knows, but this book is an excellent insight into the behind-the-scenes of the film making process, and should satisfy anyone after a glimpse into the realms of epic Hollywood."
1,"Gag me, please!","First of all, I wouldn't even give this a star! This was a waste of plastic for the DVD! This so-called ""movie"" shouldn't have been allowed to be released and associated with the original Merlin movie. Adrian Paul and Tia Carrere should be ashamed of being in this movie. The plot is a stretch, but might have worked if they had a better cast and a lot less overacting. For his part, Adrian Paul did his best to try and save the movie, but he just couldn't carry it alone."
1,"Merlin, the INFERIOR RETURN","The special effects are nothing compared to the first movie, Merlin. They exposed the fact that the director filmed on a very small budget. The plot is nothing. The acting is substandard. It's just an excuse to create a spin-off from the original Mervin.It's not even worth watching."
2,What happened,"I really enjoyed Merlin, but where were those great writers when it came to Merlins return?! The cast was good but the visual effects were missing and the story line was not that great. I was very disappointed in it. I was expecting a high rated movie but it sure was not that. The only good parts in the whole movie was Adrian Pauls comedic side."
2,"fun, but cheap","My 8 year old bought this, I tried to talk him out of it, but it was cheap (price). Upon receiving it, he was excited to play with them, but soon after, they began to break! Very cheaply made, but hey, what do you want for the price??"
3,Breezy Literary Essays with Lots of Typos,"Lots of typographical errors there are in this collection of breezy, truncated essays. Martin Goff's essay, ""The Meaning of Imagination"" was the most memorable essay in the book for this reader (reading it in 1991). Polkinghorn's essay ""Episteme"" was interesting. I liked Nathan Mitchell's intriguing, thoughtful comment in ""The Evolution of the Novel"" that the modern novels' inventions are self-validating and self-legitimating.A list of further reading references culled from reading this book consists of: ""The Cry for Myth"" by Rollo May; ""No Marble Angels"" by Joanne Leedom-Ackerman; ""The Search for Existentialist Identity"" by James Bugenthal; ""Natural Acts"" by David Quammen; ""Coming Home Crazy"" by Bill Holm; ""Embodied Mind"" by R. Patton Howell; ""Intimate Journeys"" by James Bugenthal."
1,Contour Drawing?,I was very disappointed with this book. It didn't have much to add to the idea of quick sketching and was pretty much just another how- to- draw book--a mediocre one at that.
5,Provides just what the title states!,"This book shows very clearly how to develop fast sketching techniques so that you can capture things onto paper without relying on a camera. Some have indicated in reviews that they don't like the artist style, but these are sketches!! They are not meant to be finished works of art (which the artist refers to as studies or drawings). He explains the difference in the book quite clearly. We all must have our own style for finished works, but as a method to capture what you see fast, these techniques are sound and clear. I would recommend this book."
5,Great book,This is a good book to show you how to think about your drawing in a completely new way. Good.
4,Written well Easy To FOLLOW!!,"This book was well wriiten,informative. Simple to follow the steps.You have to practice what the author recommends!To get out anything from the book.PRACTICE! PRACTICE! PRACTICE!!"
5,travels in a liquid acoustic vision,"hell-jya, this cd is one of the finest available. This disk will show fans a whole other side to sublime- this isn't some crystalline, mooged'out studio record- nowaay- this is some hardcore, raw, keg party hooliganism at its best. Sit back in your room, smoke a j, and pretend bradley's playing for you- cause that's what it feels like."
4,A little bit different,"This was a good CD overall, I liked Saw Red, Don't Push, and Pool Shark, but a few of the songs came off as kind of slow and boring. The rest f the CD was good though."
2,"There's a bit of sentimental value here, but that's about it.","I had high hopes for this album when I bought it, but was ultimately disappointed. And I should have expected it - this album was put out 2 years after Bradley's death. It appears that when these songs were recorded, it was never with the intention of placing them on an album, so don't expect studio-quality sound if you decide to give it a listen.To make matters worse, some songs are a lot shorter than their studio versions, and some songs are live recordings yet not labeled so on the case. You might find some sentimental value here if you're a die-hard Sublime fan, but I'd prefer to remember them at their finest."
5,Perfect,"This is a truly great album. However, if you didn't know who Brad Nowell was before you looked at this CD, turn around. It's not for you.The hardcore Sublime fans should enjoy this collection of unreleased acoustical performances. Obviously is is a minor departure from his typical ska/reggae/rock. Interestingly, many of these songs were ""works in progress"" and eventually evolved into real, released songs (or parts thereof), such as ""Saw Red,"" ""Big Salty Tears"" (it merged into Wrong Way) ""Garden Grove,"" and KRS One. Although these tracks weren't intended for release, Brad makes it work.The best songs are: ""Saw Red,"" "" KRS-One,"" ""Foolish Fool,"" and ""Boss DJ."""
3,A mixed bag,"This album seems a little forced, like they're looking too far in some directions (a 45-second demo of ""Wrong Way""? Please!) and not far enough in others -- great cover tunes of the Ziggens, Bob Marley and X, and the ""Sublime"" sessions material is quite strong. Some of the songs are just murky crap -- Boss DJ, Garden Grove and KRS-One are the worst offenders -- but other tunes are priceless: Brad's voice perfectly complements the Marley tunes and ""Foolish Fool"" and ""Little District"" are terrific. All in all, worth your cash, but be selective."
5,better than sex,"Listenin to this album makes me realize that on most occasions I think id rather listen to brad and his guitar than have sex.. i dont know if that makes me weird but i wouldnt say it if it wasnt true...SO BUY IT!! Even when hes drunk out of his mind hes still a genius! Saw Red, Boss dj, Mary, This train, Dont push, Freeway Time, and of course pool shark are all legendary trax.."
4,Bradley Nowell and Friends - Acoustic,"I love this CD. If you are expecting something to sound like the Sublime songs, you will be disappointed. This is Bradley Nowell. The music is rough and raw but that is what I really love about it. It is like he is playing in the room. He is laughing, he messes up, he is stoned, he is doing what he does best. The lyrics are much more heartfelt and honest than the Sublime CDs (not that I don't love those also.)Listening to this CD makes me wonder even more what we lost when Bradley died. He was an incredible talent."
5,A fan of Sublime would love this!,"This isn't for everyone, but if you love Sublime and like their music this is a CD you can't live without."
3,Eh definitley not the best...,"DO NOT GET THIS CD IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY OWN 40 OZ AND SELF TITLED.I grew up on Sublime and have a great appreciation for their music, but I didnt really like this cd. It didnt seem to capture the essence of Sublime. I would get it if you have been a long time Sublime fan and need to complete your collection...if this will be your first Sublime cd, do not get this one...buy 40 Oz to Freedom or the Self titled cd (40 oz is better)...anyway yeah. I sold this cd actually..."
3,Good songs - poor recordings,"This is a good selection of songs, but the sound quality of the recordings is very very poor."
1,Dissapointing in more ways than one.,"Sublime was probably my favorite band at the time I bought this album. They made some great music, and I had some good memories attached to their songs. So. I bought this album, and after listening to it for a few weeks, I left it on too long and I got to hear THE HIDDEN TRACK. I was pretty excited, being a hardcore Sublime fan and finding this rare little gem. The hidden track is a song set to the tune of Copacabana...The hidden track is about 9 minutes after the last song. Pretty dissapointing."
5,a great CD for any Brad/Sublime fan,"if you like the great, relaxing reggea/punk sound of Sublime you will love this CD. Brads awesome voice and great acoustic guitar will put you in a good mood anytime. it always reminds me of summer and i listen to it constantly! if you like the other Sublime CD's you have to add this to your colection!~RIP Brad~"
3,No False Advertising Here,"This DVD delivers exactly what it promises: good-looking women stripping down and working out in the nude. My only complaint is that after the first model, the term ""Busty"" is a bit generous."
2,What a workout!,"As much as I hate to admit it, I'm trying to follow through with my resolution to exercise and watch what I eat. However, for me, this video did very little to aid in my goal.After loading this DVD I promptly dropped my pants to honor the well intended spirit of the workout program. But unfortunately, after intently following the workout in its entirety, I can say that only my right arm was exhausted and feeling the burn.Oh well, at least I gave it the old ""college"" try, and I suppose all is not lost, as I did drop a few ounces (albeit fluid ounces), and two appendages did receive a pretty brutal workout. Therefore, two stars out of five. If I were ambidextrous, three stars would have been given. I am insufficiently jointed and imaginative to even ponder a five star rating."
5,Grew up loving this book!,"My dad read this book to my sister and I when we were small. We loved it more than any other book out there! The rhymes and illustrations were superior. We all still remember each and every number and group of animals associated with the number. My sister has given this book as a baby gift for years, and now that she is having a baby of her own, she is planning on having the nursery designed with the adorable animals! It is a must read and really helps little kids enjoy both math and reading throughout life!!!"
2,Battery Eater,Works just fine on new batteries. Goes through them about every 2 hours of use. Spend the extra money and buy an LED book light!
1,Poor book light.. choose something else,"As one viewer noted, the light isn't shaded on top. Thus, when you attach it to your book, it illuminates the page but also shines back up into your eyes. Very poor design. I'll end up replacing it as it is useless for the intended purpose."
5,Great book light,"I purchased this for my 9 year old son, who has troubles falling asleep at times. Now, when he can't fall asleep, he gets out his book and uses his new book light. It is very easy to use and he loves it. He says he can read the whole page (Harry Potter hard-cover book, etc.) with no problems at all. Great item - Great price."
5,An Equal Sequel,"""The Chains of Fate"" is a most worthy sequel to ""The Moon in the Water."" Rarely do I read a sequel that is as good or better than the first book. ""The Chains of Fate"" was awesome. I first read this book 17 years ago. I bet I have read and re-read this trilogy by Ms. Belle a hundred times. In fact my sister and I discussed reading the trilogy this summer along with all of our friends who have also read them. If you love English History, and an inveigling tale, then read this book and trilogy. Ms. Belle is truly a great wordsmith."
1,tag,not what i thought this was a tag book my mistake but the batteries were covered with rust or acid
3,MADE IN CHINA,"I have tried over the years to buy made in the USA. Pfaltzgraff claims to be ""America's Potter since 1881""Well so much for buying American! Made in China is on the bottom of each piece."
5,love these dishes,I ordered these dishes because I like the design and functions the best of all the dishes I have seen. I needed new everyday dishes and chose these. I love the pattern. The dishes were shipped in a timely manner. The packing was excellent. The internal box was not even dented. The dishes are really pretty but not dainty so you are afraid to use them. I am enjoying them immensely.
5,Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose 16-Piece Dinnerware Set,Purchased this as a gift from the Amazon website. It arrived promptly and safely (well packed in original carton). $30 off the retail price plus shipping. I've never had a problem with any Pfaltzgraff stoneware. Attractive and hardy.1/19/2012--I've since noticed this pattern (and other stoneware) in thrift shops and they usually have utensil marks which are a pain to clean off (like cleaning silverware). I just replaced a Noritake set of stoneware because of how often I had to scrub off these marks. They started showing up after a few years of daily use. I won't change my rating but wanted other buyers to be aware of this particular issue with stoneware in general.
1,"Newer ""Made in China"" pieces are low quality....","I have been collecting Tea Rose pieces for 15 years... ""back in the day"" they were made in the USA. Recently I bought some replacement pieces because I had broken a couple plates and bowls, and I am very disappointed to discover the new ""Made in China"" pieces are of terrible quality. They scratch very easily, dark gray scratches. The old style scratched also, but not nearly as bad as the new ones. I have posted a picture showing how dark the scratches are on the new plate vs the old plate. They sell porcelain polish that will supposedly take the scratches off, but who wants to polish their dishes with porcelain polish every time you use them? I so want to get a different set of dishware now, but unfortunately I have a LOT of Tea Rose pieces that I will have to replace. I guess I will hunt on Ebay for some of the older, Made in the USA, pieces."
5,Pfaltzgraff dishes,Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose 16-Piece Dinnerware Set. Service for 4Absolutely love these dishes. I shopped around and Amazon had the best price and free shipping. Great deal! A++++
4,Good replacement.,"Shifter is easy to install. A perfect replacement for my bike's original shifter that wore out. Shift points line up perfectly with my cluster gear. Works very well, but I wish the shifts were crisper.I especially like Niagara Cycle Works. They have low prices, good service, and delivered more than I paid for!"
2,Item received is not what is pictured,The SRAM shifter was received in the original packaging but the part does not match the picture or the installation instructions. The picture shows an adjustment screw for the cable but this shifter does not come with one. Even SRAM's Website shows and describes the screw. Had to return for a refund. Otherwise the part seemed to be well made for the price and probably would have functioned well if you don't need the adjustment at this end.
3,"Bought the 6 speed, it has the adjusting nut.","I have to say I am not sold on this shifter yet. I bought it to replace a SunRace twist shifter (factory shifter on a used kids Diamondback bike I have) which was shifting very hard even after I replaced the cable.The SRAM MRX is an almost drop in replacement for the SunRace, though it is a bit longer so the grips stick out a bit more. They are in fact very similar in design, which is probably not good. Unfortunately the SRAM also looks to be unserviceable, or at least very difficult to service since it appears to be a snapped together design. For the price maybe this is not a bad thing, but I like to be at least able to replace a cable on a shifter without tearing the whole thing apart with difficulty. It is cheap, but I would characterize this as a mild upgrade over the OEM SunRace shifter but time will tell. Also, at least for the 6 speed version, there is an adjusting nut."
4,Great replacement,"Product easily replaced broked shifter on a 21spd Schwinn Mountain bike.Easy install, good price and fast shipping.Comes with new cable as well."
4,As far as grip shifters go...,"I was very happy with the seller: good price, and quick shipping. The shifter itself works as well as I expected. Generally I don't like grip shifters, but when working with a kids bike there is generally no choice. This one was easy to install and came with it's cable, and that was nice. If you can get it for under $10 it is a good deal."
3,My First venture into Vangelis....and I want more,"I have listened to this album and am impressed with it...liking the later stuff rather than the old..Pulstar,Intergalactic Radio, Metallic Rain and Will of the wind being my favourites. I would be appreciative of anyones recommendations as to further albums in the spheres of these songs...email me:)"
3,not complete,"The sections Bloody Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Air War on Japan, and Surrender of Japan are good, But the section shifting Tides in the Orient is not good and the section on the Korean War ends abruptly in the middle of the war when China entered the war."
1,Total Waste,"Only solutions to problems.. But you don't have a clue what the problem was to begin with. Seller should have at leastmentioned that a text book is required to use this book and gave ISBN number, name of text, author for required text."
1,terrible,"Yes, it was a ""recreated"" poster, which means it wouldn't be as good as an original poster. However, it looks terrible. It looks like the original image wasn't of a high enough quality to be blown up to poster size. The colors don't stick out at all."
2,Not very good likeness,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the recreated poster. Background was too dark while title, character and screens weren't bright enough to stand out."
2,Retractor Broke after 2 months of light use,"Worked fine until the retractor broke. A piece of plastic cracked off the inside of the retractor causing it to stop working. The cable itself still functions, just doesn't retract."
1,Unreliable,"I've had many retractable cables in the past and I some to be great and some to be unreliable.These, unfortunately, were in the latter category.After about a minute or two of being connected, my iphone will be forced disconnected. It may have something to do with the thin wiring used to make it retractable.Unfortunatley, this was so painful to try to use I eventually threw it out and purchased an OEM Apple usb connector. Not retractable, but 100% reliable.From my experience with retractable cords, I would guess that some of these will work, some won't. I'm fairly certain a lot won't work out of the box, but for $1.88, the company knows no one will be pay the shipping for returns or exchanges.My advice is not to buy this unless maybe you want to pick up six at once and hope that one works perfectly."
3,Inexpensive,Get what you pay for. Good for a back up but prefer a more quality product for everyday use.
4,Cheap and it works for me,Unbelievable price and it works! The one I was sent works fine with my iPod Touch 3G.
1,Cheap and did not work...,"I ordered two of these. One arrived broken. The inner plastic piece had cracked and the spring inside of it had started to come out. The second one works physically, but when I plug it into my car it does not charge my iPhone 3gs. Not worth the hassle. Looks like it would be a clever solution, but didn't work for me."
2,"Works alright, has slightly pink color in certain lighting","I've gotten two of these now so I can have cables around when I need them. It's small and works fine, and the price can't be beat (though the shipping exceeds the price of the item!) The plastic on both of the ones I got has a sort of ugly pinkish hue in low light conditions, but I didn't exactly buy it for its aesthetic value anyway, so I guess that's alright...EDIT TO ADD: after some months, this completely fell apart (wires at one of the connections were coming out of the wire covering, and were frayed and blackened/sizzled looking) I'm glad no fires were started or anything, but it was annoying because I was traveling and didn't have a back-up way to connect to charge the phone or sync info. Booo. You get what you pay for, I guess. Unreliable shoddy product, in the end, but I could probably have guessed that from the price."
2,Not for charging,This cable works for connecting my iPod to my computer but when I disconnect it later my battery is drained and I have to restart my iPod several times.
2,Lasted six months,"I had a similar experience to another reviewer in that the internal plastic part broke and the pen is now non-functional. I used it a few times a week and carried it in my purse, so I don't think I abused or overused it. It's too bad, because I really liked it. If it had been cheaper, I would have purchased another, but I think the cost is too high given the lifespan."
4,Greatest direct to video zombie flick ever ?,"Flight of the living dead may be the best direct to video zombie flick ever and overall except romero's zombie flicks and a few others (resident evil films, 28 days and weeks later) this film comes right next to them.The plot, the gore, the suspense, the airplane location were all very good.If u are a zombie fan the buy this dvd. I'm sure u will watch it again after a few years."
4,awesome,"new genre zombie stewardess' make sure every one is comfortably dead and tasty.liars get eaten too,eventually.a must see film for all horror fans,enjoy the in fright movie ladies and gentlemen."
3,If You Love a Good Thrill for Halloween....See this movie!,"Okay I was raised on Sci Fi and Thrillers. And especially around Halloween...I want something different. And wowie.....I got my money's worth for this movie! Lots of blood and guts spilled, but it has a good story and I was always on the edge of my seat...and the Big Plus for me it has Dale Midkiff in it. Not nearly enough, but at least he was there for me to enjoy. I don't fly anymore...so this one will not haunt me. haha. But if you do...beware the cargo! Booooooooooo!"
3,The Title Tells It All,"I was in the mood for a laugh so I decided to watch Flight of the Living Dead which is obviously about zombies reeking havok on a plane. To my suprise it was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it for what it was. Nothing special but it was very entertaining and had a pretty creepy concept. If you think about it; being on a plane with zombies is probably the worst spot you can be in. If you're up 30,000 feet in the air there really isn't too much you can do about escaing. It definately is way worse then having some snakes crawling around.If you are a zombie movie fan then you will probably love this one."
3,This movie is really enjoyable.,"This movie is really a must for all zombie fans. It is a lot better then most people think and not quite as bad as the 2 stars are saying. They manage to tell a story of zombies on a plane and make it pretty ummmm, realistic :) well, as realistic as you can be. The story makes sense and as the others have said, bullets are a plenty. As is opening plane doors at 20k feet. Ok, seriously now. People die, zombies die, zombies are formed and story is told. You have a spare 90 minutes before you go to sleep at night watch it. I can give you alist of 20 zombie movies that are a lot worse then this that I am sure you have seen."
2,It isn't good movie!!!,I saw this movie and this movie was bad. Because the nothing as new Zombie movies. It's the same shoot the head and die. The movie maker realized this movie not a big hit. I thought the movie maker waste the money for production cost. this movie is not fun at all.
2,Hilarious!,"I don't think the people who did this movie intended to make a comedy, but it was funny. The zombie's mewl like cats and make these strange noises that killed it for me. There were a couple good ""jump"" moments, mainly out of surprise rather than anything interesting, but I couldn't get into it."
4,Pleasantly suprised.,I don't usually care for Zombie comedies but I actually liked this one. There was a lot of profanity though.
3,Good chessy fun!,"This is a good low budget straight to video Zombie pic. It takes a new twist on the genre by using a plane as the setting, is it is scary and at the same time funny. A science experiment goes bad and soon the the passengers on the plane are exposed and are trapped thousands of feet in the air, chased by zombies. You have to see the scene when you have an old woman that becomes a zombie, but has no teeth so her bite is harmless and one passenger that becomes zombiefied is stuck in his seat the whole movie and tries in vain to reach people. Nice entertaining film."
4,"i liked it, much better then most zombie flicks","i liked this movie, i was stunned for i didn't think i would, the girls were hot, the acting was good, the zombies were great, i enjoyed every minute of this movie, will watch again, even the storyline was good, more zombie movies like this and ill be a happy camper,some of it was not realistic, but so what, i recommend this movie highly..............."
4,"Flight Of The Living Dead is a life raft, in a sea of crap that is the (low budget)zombie genre","Flight Of The Living Dead(Or ""Plane Dead"" as it was when I first saw it.) is a life raft, in a sea of crap that is the zombie genre.It's one major drawback is the overall look of the film, it has a hardcore ""Soap Opera, Shot on Video"" look to it(especially upconverted to 1080p.)But if you're able to look past this one minor flaw, Flight Of The Living Dead will be one of the best low budget zombie movies you've seen in years.7/10"
3,Decent zombie movie...,"I actually worked on this film from start to finish... it was both very fun and very difficult to make, but we did out best and came out with a decent zombie movie... some great gags, fun stunts, and a few very sexy zombie stewardesses!"
4,most fun i've ever had on a a flight!,"snakes on a plane 2? ok, i go along with that, but, this snakes/zombies flick is way, way, better! i sure would like to get up and, do as much running up and down the iles as they do in this movie; for some of those long flights i've been on. the zombies in this movie look and act alot like the infected in '28 days later' and '28 weeks later.' of course, in those two movies you had a lot of room for escape. in this movie your traped, in an enclosed space 60,000 feet in the air. anyone who has spent two days traped in a car, in the snow, with bears,wolves and, whatever else is in the area, knows what that type of fear is like (i've been there!) that is what makes this movie so real!"
3,Snakes on a plane.....I mean zombies on plan,"I am not sure if this movie was a ""carry over"" from the provious zombie movies, Return of the Living Dead and the rest of the sequeals but this particular movie seem to have been more professionally made. It was however, not very scary and it was goofy but there was plenty of humor to go around. I am a true die-hard fan of zombie movies, but I am not going to put this one in my top ten favorites."
4,A movie that soars in an era of remakes!,"""Flight of the Living Dead"" is a really fun, campy, entertaining zombie-horror film. There's lots of rapid-fire action scenes, explosive gore throughout the film, interesting and enticing character development, and some great slapstick humor to boot. Basically, this is everything beautiful about zombie exploitation with B-movie good-times and comedy thrown in for good measure. It takes a little bit for the movie to really kick off but once it does, the laughs, full-on gore and action don't stop! Highly recommended for zombie fans. Thanks for the time, and peace."
3,This is some pretty silly stuff,This is some pretty silly stuff but not too bad for a direct to video release. The acting and special effects are ok and it even has some recognizable acting faces. It really falls into the fun/bad horror genre. My brother is a federal air marshal so I am buying him a copy for Christmas.
3,"That's The Good Thing About Zombies, They Don't Care What Passenger Class You Are Flying, You're Lunch","Well, Well, Well, what a scary surprise this movie turned out to be, zombies everywhere, snacking and infecting, it takes about half an hour to fully get going then look out, it's gore galore.The cast does a pretty good job as they liven things up by avoiding becoming lunch and fighting back, it's quite funny in places too.Not bad for straight to DVD, if you enjoy seeing zombies do their thing that is.AKA : Plane Of The Dead."
3,Its alright I guess,"This movie was okay, of course theres your sub par acting, really random unrealistic moments(as if zombies on a plane happens everyday) Like when already in the air and two young guys decide to throw a football around........ Who would even think about doing that on a plane? Even tho the ball was taken away, in real life someone would have tackled one of the guys mid throw. Theres another scene with guy in first class, a black named ""Billy"" ....... thats pushing it, that can make fun of itself. But for some reason hes polishing a golf club (oh yeah hes a pro golfer..... Wait theres more....... With a black wife........... WHAAAAATT!!!!!!!!) theres no way in hell on a commercial airplane would a golf club be okay outside of the cargo area. Even tho this movie had your typical eyebrow raising moments for a zombie flick, I gave this movie threes stars b/c the zombies looked cool and the Idea of having a zombie outbreak on a plane was pretty cool."
4,"Fasten Seatbelts, This Ride's Gonna Get Bumpy","It is what it is, the title says it all. Zombies rampage on a flight bound for Paris. ""Flight of the Living Dead"" may start off slow, but when the action starts, it doesn't stop. You're led on a thrill ride at 26,000 feet.I was a bit skeptical upon purchasing this film. However, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised with this film. The acting, gore and special effects were all pretty decent. At times a bit cheesy, but has enough bite to revive the genre. Zombie fans should seriously consider this for their collection. An overall fun film."
3,touching,But not exactly well made. Low quality video. Kinda an advertisement for the one guys process. I did enjoy it but would not recommend
2,Painful,"This documentary was pretty bad... Admittedly, I coldn't even make it throught the whole thing, so perhaps the end is life-changing. I watched it because it was recommened as a video related to The Secret. It does not not stack up to anything like The Secret."
1,SUCKS EGGS!,"Recently, we have been reading books concerning ""looking within,"" some are are better than others. This SUCKS EGGS! New age, metaphycisical, junk-science, blah-blah. Better to read Dear Abby and your daily horoscope. Magic Eightball may prove more insightful."
4,Great bargain!,"It is the exact artwork I asked for...however it was a bit smaller than I anticipated, my fault. I did not pay close enough attention to the measurements. I do like it though. I framed it and it actually is just the right size for the wall I hung it on!! SO, it worked out well! Plus it was a huge bargain! I love it."
2,"Caution: Worse than ""Abridged""","Pros: Wonderful Illustrations.Cons: The language is dumbed down. Jane Austen's words have been ""translated"" to simpler, more modern language, losing all the great quotes. It might be fine if you think your child might never enjoy reading the original, or if you think your younger child can read it now but still enjoy the original later.Amazon: Please make it clearer that this is a ""specially adapted version"" in the description. I guess I should have noticed that there was an ADDITIONAL AUTHOR listed."
2,Disappointing,"If your an original Salvatore Adamo fan and expect to hear the original music that you listened to from his LPs on this CD, you will be highly disappointed. It sounds like these recordings have been done much later than the original ones, the music here is different, a more modern sound to it and his voice does not sound as strong as in his earlier recordings."
4,good refrence,"The book is very good detailed in depth explainsion for all the marine auxiliaries on board ships it is very helpful for both marine engineering students & ship crew .it goes in deep analysis for all the marine systems ,how it works ,system materials .classification societies rules in some cases. The only problem I can see the language is a little hard. Apart from that it is a good book .if u are not very specialized in marine engineering & just want basic knowledge (introduction to marine engineering) is a good start"
5,awsome,"great movie, I love john wayne's movies he is and was a great actor, would definately recomend this movie to friends and family"
5,Great Grandfather,"My father and Great Grandfather love this movie, and consider it one of the best John Wayne movies. I bought it for them and they highly recommend it to watch."
5,Best Western,I generally like all John Wayne westerns but this one had such a worktogether cast and Wayne's character was accurately portrayed throughoutthe whole movie that I got the feeling that this was truly a believablestory.
5,Sons of Katie Elder,John Wayne at his best. Item came in plenty of time for Christmas and was in the condition described.
5,Another winner,This is another great western and it was based on a true story. It is just another epic western full of great actors and an excellent story line.
3,The Sons of Katie Elder 1965,"Katie Elder bore four sons . The day she is buried they all return home to Clearwater , Texas to pay their last respect . John Wayne (1907-1979) is the eldest and toughest son , a gunslinger . Tom ( Dean Martin 1917-1995) is good with a deck of cards and good with a gun when he has to be . Matt (Earl Holliman 1928- ) is the quiet one -noboby ever called him yellow..twice . Bud (Michael Anderson,Jr (1943- ) is the youngest . Any hope for respectability lies with him . Directed by Henry Hathaway (1898-1985) an acknowledged master of the western , the story has a dual theme : Not only this a he-man?s story but also a drama of the material influence of Katie Elder , movingly portrayed from Beginning to conclusion ! Is this a good Western Movie ! -No it?s a bad plot and nothing realy of sense happend here .Transfer in high Quality ."
2,Just God Awful,"Please, no more John Wayne-Dean Martin movies. Just as slow moving and horsey as they get."
1,DVD doesn't work,I received this DVD and it does not work in any DVD player. I am very disappointed with this product
1,Item in Picture is not what you get,"The picture is not what is being sold when you order this product. They have the wrong picture, what you get is a ZIGI Girl canvas shoe. Tried to order this boot twice before finding out the this boot is no longer available."
2,Early Start For Jackie.,"This was Jackie Chan's first lead role and he didn't even do his whole role. You can tell there is a double because he's always looking away from the camera, and is blind folded in the final fight. It also is a revenge plot. Jackie can really move in this movie."
1,so tight it pulled my RCA connector off my tuner,"The item I received was ont exactly the one pictured. Those received appear to be made of high quality materials with stout connectors. Having a ""tight"" connection at the RCA jack is important but these are ridiculous. It's nearly impossible to fully seat them, and when removed they pulled both of the rim pieces off my female RCA jacks on my NAD tuner. These things are just WAY too tight to be of good use and might damage your equipment. Some cables are designed to be loosened by twisting the end before inserting, but this does not appear to work for these cables. Overall VERY disappointed in these things."
3,Pretty good but the headphones are poor quality,"I am currently in using the product and I think it's great. I'm a visual learner so it works out but I do have to say that you should get a Spanish to English dictionary. The headphones\microphone that come with the software are not very good. Even speaking in a clear loud voice it misses words. I'm not talking about hard to say ones, it misses words like ""el"" and ""la"" even with several attempts. I used the onboard mic on my laptop and it seems to be better.Other than the headphones I am pleased with the software so far."
5,Well worth the money,"I bought this for my wife, who has wanted to learn Spanish for years. She has found it very instuctive and spends at least an hour a day doing the lessons. She has learned quickly and easily and is almost ready for further lessons. This program is expensive, but well worth it if worked the way Rosetta Stone suggests."
4,Above average,"Ozark was above average. It burned well, had a nice mild smell, and had nice pieces in the bag."
3,Conspicuously missing from DVD... Hmm...,"Great war film I just watched on this silent classics VHS, which at the moment is the only place its available. There's nothing wrong with this release at all, in fact it has a score by the wonderful Carl Davis, the highest sought-after silent film composer. Nice picture, and a great film, sorely missed on a more stable format that doesn't have the scrolling tape problems of VHS."
2,Disappointingly nave depiction of WWI,"A tightly structured story relating one man's life-changing experiences during WWI. The depiction of wartime that it presents is disappointingly nave, especially when compared with a film like All Quiet on the Western Front, released only five years later. The scenes of the American soldiers calmly walking towards the Germans as bullets whiz around them are rather ridiculous, as is the scene where dozens of German soldiers suddenly give up even though the Americans have only fired a single shot. Another weakness of the film is that the numerous comedic moments aren't especially amusing."
5,"""Where is the toilet?"" is in the book","The reviewer who complained that they could not find the phrase ""where is the toilet?"" in this phrasebook was not trying very hard. For every language, it is either present in the section ""Around Town"" under the question heading ""Where is the ..."", or else it can easily be created by combining that half question with the word for ""toilet"", found in the immediately preceding section, ""Useful Words"". One small annoyance is that the tone key in the Vietnamese section shows the tonal contours, but does not key them to the accent marks. However, the Quick Reference Vietnamese chart on the last page does give this information. Overall, the book is a handy compendium of phrases for eight different languages, and includes a modicum of cultural hints. No space is available for brief grammars or dictionaries, but if these are desired, the reader can purchase separate Lonely Planet phrasebooks for any of the individual languages."
4,Great little phrasebook,"I ordered this book prior to going to the Peace Corps (knowing I would also get formal language training). I also knew it might come in handy for traveling in the region. The size is great. The content was very functional and for the language I was using, the translations and phonetic spellings were really spot on to what I was learning in my formal language classes. Thumbs up!"
2,Where is the toilet?,"This book reviews a number of South-East Asian langauges. Overall the layout is understandable. The overview of tones in each language (there are a few tonal languages in the region) is handled well, and the pronounciation is good enough that you can be understood when you try to speak the sentences.The book falls short in what it decides to translate. We found out, to our dismay, that the phrase, ""where is the toilet?"" was not to be found. This is the primary reason for the low rating. The first words presented in the chapter are basic introductions, which are good. However there are some emergency phrases that should be placed better. ""Where is the pharmacy?"" is a phrase that was cleverly hidden in the text.Hopefully these issues will be cleared up by the second edition. I would recommend against using this book as it stands now as your only reference when travelling."
4,"comfortable sneakers, although not warm enough for cold weather","I simply need a pair of comfortable sneakers, and I got it. The shoes are really comfortable and real in size. The only thing is that they are not quite warm enough for cold weather."
4,wonderful shoe,"I was a little unsure about purchasing shoes online but I needed them in a pinch and they are awesome. I have no brand loyalties for shoes, but I love these. I ordered a little big, just to be on the safe side but turns out there was no need. I have wide and tall feet and these are perfect, there's no uncomfortable rubbing or tightness. They're super comfy for walking [I'm not a runner] and they're very cute. The light pink is just enough and the silver isn't too silver. I love them, and I'll probably get them again next time."
2,Cute but feels cheap..,"I have been wearing these shoes for about 4 months. They are good looking but feel cheaper than the shoes I replaced made by Nike Air---which also was more expensive than this pair of Adidas. I would probably not buy this shoe again.Nothing compares to a great running shoe with cushion inside to protect your foot as it hits the pavement. I feel like this Adidas has no cushion and that my foot is not protected. Also, the Nike shoes were purchased at a running store which is the really best place to buy them."
4,All Around,"I bought these shoes to start working out again and I wasn't disappointed. They are comfortable, keep my feet dry and seem to provide enough comfort for running, etc. However, if you have a high arch, I recommend inserts. I had to use some."
4,Now 62- The bad and the good,"After listening to this album (some of the songs several times-hehehe) I have decided that it is a very good tracklist, with a few exceptions. Some of the songs made me cry to stop, but i wont go into details about which ones. I like the front cover, but the colours on the discs were disgusting. They should definitly start using different colours."
4,perfect...,It came in the mail a little slowly. It was shipped to my house and was exactly what I was looking for!
4,Attempt,"I think this movie made a decent attempt to capture the struggle of living in poverty as Nuyoricans. It has a good amount of poignant moments from beginning to the very end and also its equivalent share of wacky hilarious moments, which I wont spill and spoil for you that should buy this movie if even you are latino or not, it doesnt matter. I think anyone can relate or try to the struggles we personally face or others do. I think the fact that I expected too much realism, being Puerto Rican myself, was a reason why I could not digest the exaggeration it portrayed. If you want more realism about what it truly means to be hispanic or want to know more and you are not , please, please check out Manito I promise you will not regret it and will feel so much more moved than this movie."
5,GO CHINO,I like it like that.... this movie has been a fav of me and my husband since we met soo long ago. Really love the characters and the story line. If you are a boricua you will love it.
5,I liked it like that!!,"This movie has been out for years but I just stumbled upon it recently on late night cable TV.I loved it! It was wonderful. I loved the emphasis put on the Puerto Rican community, I loved the up close, gritty look at average New York life. I loved the interactions between Chino, Lisette and the kids, they weren't perfect parents, but they loved their kids. I just loved how realistic it all was.I'm a black woman, born and raised in California, I have no idea how life in the Bronx is but I definitely related to a lot in this movie.My favorite character was Alexis, she was a trip!5 stars!"
5,I LIKE IT LIKE THAT IS A GREAT BREAK UP TO MAKE UP MOVIE,THIS MOVIE NOT ONLY SHOWED THE LOVE BETWEEN A COUPLE AND HOW IT WOULD PREVAIL BUT IT ALSO HAD A GREAT SENSE OF LATIN STYLE
3,Good while it lasted,"My medium sized dog liked it well enough, just never made it past the first week sadly. Seams tore too easily. May be more suitable for smaller dogs."
4,Not For Chewers,"Good indoor ball, but I stopped using them since my dog tears the balls apart too quickly. If she wasn't a chewer, I'd definitely keep buying these."
4,Plush Ball,"My dog has another similar toy. I was getting this one to take to my folks house. I had not expected the hard rubber that encases the plushness of the ball. She likes her original one better. It is more fun to toss and have her fetch her old ball. The old one is about the size of a softball as is this one. It is not a bad product, just not what I had expected it to be. In time, she will probably accept it and play with it."
3,Soft for house play....but,"Our German Shepherd puppy (8 months old) had a hole chewed in 15 minutes. Oh well, the regular chuck it rolled softly won't break things in the house."
1,Junk,"My dog destroyed this so fast I didn't even have time to stop him. This was a total waste. I didn't expect it to last forever, but I thought it would last a little longer than it did."
5,Dog toy,Great toy for large dogs. Can't keep it put away when we go to the park. Even gets shared with there friends. Bright color makes it easy to find.
2,Not ideal for dogs who like to chew,"Purchased this product based hoping that the material would be soft enough, but durable. Within 1 minute our 1.3 yr - 56 lbs mixed pit tore a whole through the ball cover and pulled out all the stuffing. Bummers, the ball didn't even make it through the 2nd bounce. This product would probably be best for indoor dogs who are not strong chewers or like to rip stuffed toys apart. Will keep searching for the right toy."
2,"Unfortunately, not for heavy chewers.","Good fabric but my 25lb Pug/Boston Terrier mix had stuffing all over the floor in less than an hour. Go for the ""Chuckit! Ultra Ball, Medium"" for something impossible to destroy."
1,"Great dog toy for fetching, not for chewing",My Labradoodle love this toy. It's large enough to he can't swallow it and he hasn't destroy any part of it yet. Seems to be made well.** UPDATE - 5/2012 **My doddle destroyed the ball via light chewing.
2,Stitching came out within an hour,The material itself seems to be durable enough for playing fetch in the house but the stitching started to come out within an hour of playing fetch. I will probably sew it up and see how long the material itself will last.
2,Bummer,Although we love the ChuckIt! Brand - this Plush Ball did not hold up to the usual quality. After 2 weeks our 14 month old puppy have already ripped the ball.
1,I am very disappointed in this purchase.,"This perfume I gave it to a friend, my friend told me that the smell is rapidly lost, I am very disappointed in this purchase."
5,Santos De Cartier Spray,I have used this cologne for many years and feel it's the best on the market. I hear Cartier has quit producing it but am fortunate we can still purchase it online.
5,Psyche of a City,"Not only is Ms. Pike an extraordinary writer and researcher, this book, filled with rich personal histories and vivid snapshots of a distinct moment in time - candy apples after a long Sunday stroll, the morning after a devastating race riot, the third hour of a guitar god's marathon four-hour late night jam session - is much like a window into the soul and psyche of this city. Here is Asbury Park's unbridled id, guilty conscience, wistful longing, crisis of confidence, repressed traumas and finally, its courageous conviction. Pick it up, and this book will become your constant companion.--- July 2005, Christina Eliopoulos, Writer/Director, Greetings from Asbury Park, a documentary feature film"
3,Great history - Book takes great effort to read tho.....,"This book has great history features and includes personalized accounts of folks alive and not living, as well as photos and artifacts. What really irked me was the book would've been alot more enjoyable had it been written in chronological order. The stories with their timelines on the various features of Asbury Park are splattered all over. Although the 7 chapters are segmented by features, i.e., 'The Avenues,' 'Dining Out, Sleeping In,' it would've been more enjoyable to take these segments in their respective timeframe, and see the growth from the 1800's thru Y2002. Alot of photos and artifacts are NOT dated, which makes it disappointing as well. I got a headache trying to match places and dates with artifacts and photos. The effort is a good book that would've been even better if there was some order to it. P.S. The book is under the auspices of Rutgers Univ. Press about a NJ town and printed in SINGAPORE....."
1,Hyperpreterism,"The blurb on the back from Brian McLaren is a sign that the emergents are as dangerous to orthodoxy as we have feared. You cannot write a book focusing on how all of the apocalyptic passages in the NT were fulfilled in AD 70 without addressing how this doesn't compromise the orthodox understanding of the second coming, last judgment and resurrection of the living and the dead. Perriman only does this in his blog, but treats hyper-preterism as a possible option that he personally rejects. The emergents are getting a well deserved reputation for being willing to entertain any heresy in the name of being open and inclusive."
2,"Good graphics, but failed after 13 months","Purchased this product in Dec 2006, card started to fail in Dec 2007. Did not realize the problem until card was out of warranty. Company refuses to compensate or replace due to warranty of 12 months. Will not buy from this company again, as there are others that make a card with simular capabilities. Costs were high and expectations were met initially. Card failed completely 13 months after purchase."
1,I'm only giving it one star cuz I half to,"If your a so-called V.C. Andrews ghost writer fan then you'll probably like this book. But if your a fan of the Real V.C. Andrews then your like me and hated it. I don't know why I read these books there always the same. Whimpy sappy girl grows up in some kind of sterotypical slums and is the smartest one out of the family of yokles or hood rats. She is smart beautiful and well spoken. She never gives her mommy (momma) any trouble or her evil Daddy (pa0. And she is a wonderful singer,dancer,painter,actress or all of the above. Then one day her rose color glasses are knocked of by some kind of soap opera betrayal. She is sold or kidnapped. Get some new ideas for crying out loud people are hip to your same ol same ol plots. Give up while your miles behind Mr.Ghost writter. Never send a man to a woman's job."
3,Good but not like old VCA,"I did enjoy this book. It was very interesting and most defenitely a page turned. It was predictable again,but hey thats VCA books. The part about making fun of Vodoun didnt go over big with me though,but thats the media. Summer was a very couragious and smart herione. This book isnt as good as what VCA actually wrote not her GW."
2,"STANDARD FARE -- SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW, SECRETS LIE","It comes as no surprise that Rain gave her only a child a nature themed name. It comes as no surprise that in the fourth installment, Summer would be the narrator.Rain, Summer and the Hudson bunch are by far and away the best Ghostwriter aka V.C. Andrews characters. Fortunately things work out for this bunch. Never one to pass up a chance to throw in the brother-sister thing, Summer predictably hooks up with her step uncle Roy's stepson, Harley. Although they are not related (thank goodness), they did have a fraternal relationship as children. So as usual, we got that fraternal mix into the works not to mention a truckload of dirty linen that is about to be washed and some skeletons that come dancing out of the closets.Standard fare."
3,OK,"I like V.C. Andrews, I've read the Heaven series, Flower series, the Melody series, the Orphan series, and the Rain series, they are all pretty good.... but I am really annoyed with the newer ones, Melody and Rain.... because they are all goody-goodies and say ""Mommy"" fifty times a page. ""Mommy and Daddy will be worried"" are their favorite quotes. soooooo irritating! You NEVER hear them say Mother, Father, Mom, or Dad. And I wish they would act more mysterious.... like the earlier ones. And they can't ever answer ""Yes,"" they have to say ""Yes, Mommy"" or ""Yes, Uncle Roy"" why do they always have to say the name afterwards?? I think they need to grow up."
2,zzzzzzzzzzz,"I love VC Andrews but the Rain series is very boring. They start out pretty well, but by the time you get to the last book, this one, you pretty much don't care what happens at all. Stick with Flowers in the Attic Series, cutler series, casteel series, and the ruby series. Leave the new stuff alone."
3,...........grrrr,i would have really enjoyed this book if it had more in it. the book is good but i guess i just expected too much. Ruby is my favorite vca book because it had so many things going on in it and i just expected that since all the previous books in the hudson series were great that this one would be even better.
4,Good,"I just wanted to say that this book was good. If you like the type of book that whirls you with its emotions, then go for it. The main character is very sweet and you see the lesson she gets through life. Its emotional, and has a happy ending."
2,Same old plot...,"This ghostwriter is unbelievely uncreative! ALL THE PLOTS ARE THE SAME! Always. Let's see, there's this beautiful, talented, smart, and perfect girl who loves her Mommy and Daddy a lot...(16-year-olds DON'T go around calling their parents Mommy and Daddy!) There always has to be some guy who is a relative...or somewhat related that's in love w/the girl. He is unable to like any other girl, since she's ""special"". I find it very disturbing how that plot is repeated over and over again...Summer and the people around her talk using vocabulary and metaphors that normal ppl would only use in writing. Normal teenagers don't talk like college professors! There also is always some person who flips out, or is extremely religious... This book is so unrealistic. Harley looks like Kevin Bacon?!! So what? Is that supposed to be good? Seriously...they should get a better ghostwriter who can come up with original and realistic stories!"
1,Disappointed!,"Okay, now anyone who reads V.C. Anndrews' novels knows that there are always 5 books! With 5 books you get the explanation of how the whole mess started in the first place. As far as I can tell there is no plan for the 5th book. But that is not the only reason I am giving this book a low rating. The other is that it was the worst one in the whole series, which was unimpressive to begin with. But the bad thing about a series is that once you begin them you just have to finish-if you know what I mean. The main character for End of the Rainbow, Summer is not one that you can fall into, and is very unbelievable and one dimensional. The plot is boring. This book is written in V.C. Andrews form but it has none of her style. I suggest if you want to read V.C. Andrews, read V.C. Andrews, and not a ghost writter who can't fill her shoes!"
1,*sigh*,"I started reading the Andrews novels over 10 years ago and was totally hooked. Rain was the first Andrews novel I'd read since the Landry series.I started reading the novels again because I wanted something fun to read while studying for the Bar Exam. The other books in this series were bad, but End of the Rainbow is one of the worst novels I've ever read. I kept reading the other novels because I kept expecting Rain to lose her inheritence or something unpredictable to happen.I really don't think the ghostwriter planned this novel very well. It was as if he had one storyline going and decided near the end to have Summer and Harley trapped in the basement. Ridiculous.If End of the Rainbow is any indication, the better days of the V.C. Andrews novels are over."
3,Sadly lacking the V.C Andrew magic,"Ive been an avid reader of V.C Andrews books for a long time. Her books were always so well written, that i would have never thought that they would be so lacking in all aspects. When i finished reading The End of The Rainbow i was really depressed. I was hoping that maybey the Rain series would live up to the rest, but it didnt. The whole story seemed rushed and undeveloped, it lacked the usual magic that made her books fantastic. Although i cant ever give up entirely on Neiderman because i love V.C Andrews so much, i'll just keep hoping that this book isnt the end of the rainbow."
1,VC Andrews Must Be Turning Over In Her Grave!,"OK, OK. VC Andrews books are a guilty pleasure but this was unbearable. I can't wait to sell it on Ebay or Amazon Auctions. Talk about boring - all you had to do was skim the pages and you got the story. And the story is another rehash of mean people, inner/inter family love, etc. The ending made no sense and hopefully the ghostwriter will realize that the next time he is writing a series to stay out of the present time for the time for all the books. This book could have been written by a 12 year old!"
1,A Cure For Insomnia,God what a horrible book! The ghostwriter should just stop now and quit disgracing the name of a very talented writer. If the name V.C. Andrews wasn't plastered across the front I guarentee you no one would give a second glance to these terrible books. Where are the secrets? The shocks and surprises? Couldn't ghostwriter have thrown a few jaw-droppers into the diary scene? I won't be buying anymore of these books. It's a waste of my money.
4,Thought is was really good...,I thought this story was great...I really liked this book along with her other resent stories. I'm a teenager and my mom got me into reading her cause I wanted to read something one day. I haven't read any of her older books from when she was actually alive and I've been told that they were really good. I would like to try reading flowers in the atic but I have to finish reading this newest series lol! I have read a couple of her series and a half and this book was really good because it had a really nice ending. Especially with Summer-n-all. That gurl is very intelligent and I would love it if she became a start of her own series even though some of those hard core V. C. Andrews fans may not like it...I personally would.
4,Andrews Best in a While,"In the conclusion of the Hudson series, Rain's daughter, Summer, happens upon tragedy and rises above it. she does not show fear at the sign of trauma. It WAS GREAT"
1,annoying and detrimenatl to your health,"Immaturity, an annoying naive outlook on the world, and good looks are the defining characteristics of the V.C. Andrews daughters. They are also somehow intrinsicly(sp?)more special and sexually more ""pure"" than their jealous peers. That and they usually experience the horror of rape only to seek no legal help nor counseling and it doesn't seem to have as an adverse effect on their lives as in the real world. Just like ""Mommy"" when she was raped probably by the same jerk i.e. Dawn by Philip then Christie by Philip."
4,not drip free- but nice grips,"not drip free, but nice grips, mostly plastic, a standard gun you can buy at home-depot, with nice grips. not worth $40 suggested retail, $12 is more like it."
4,Heavy duty for a light price,Had to replace a cheap caulk gun that was too delicate for constant use. This gun is pretty heavy duty for the low price. Definitely easier to use and seems like it will last longer than most in this price range.
3,"Tough, well built caulk gun but NOT dripless",This is a well built tough caulk gun but my no means is it dripless. Once I let go of the trigger a standard latex caulk keeps pouring out indefinitely. There was more caulk on the floor than there was on my project.
5,Works perfect,"I decided to purchase a premium caulking gun after throwing away several cheap ones made with cheap materials. I love this gun. I recently used it to apply roofing and flashing sealant, pretty tough stuff to move around. The gun performed great. I got a great bead that looks professional, and it never dripped!"
1,A Sadly Terrible Reprint of a Wonderful Story,"Unfortunately, the publisher (General Books) who has reprinted Charles Coffin's wonderful story has not taken the time to format or proofread this publication. The continuous margin-to-margin text is riddled with typos that are evidence of using a computer program to try to read and re-type the text. For example, the first full sentence I can find, after searching through lines of what might have been a contents but now appears as code, reads, ""TT LIJAII FAVOR, lived in Ryefield, np among the New Hampshire- hills. On the morning of April 20th, 1775, as lie was milking the cows, he heard a clattering of hoofs, and, looking np, saw Deacon Clyde coming as fast as his old mare could brino; him, and that was not fast enough . . . ""I'm returning this reprinted copy and asking for a full refund. It's unreadable."
4,It really doesn't matter,"The first reviewer is somewhat correct. Don't spend too much on digital interconnect cables....the digital format is used so quality will not depend on the transfer medium, that's the whole purpose of digital.I'm an electrical engineer, PCM audio for all intents and purposes is a pretty slow bitstream, you could use pretty cheap cable and not notice a difference. Just my humble opinion."
4,"Not a huge supporter of Monster, but this cable works great","I bought this cable years ago. It has gone though many, many moves as I am military. This thing still works great. I use it for my original XBOX system with the component adapter as an additional system in the garage. My problem with Monster is the price."
4,good cable,"I buy this toslink cable, and work fine, so I see another with more protection for avoid break fiber and less price, the diference 4 feet, If you like excelente sound use toslink cables."
3,Electronics Tecnician,"Ultimatly where it makes a difference is in the connector and the quality of the fiber. Since the signal doesn't have to travel a great distance, the quality of the fiber doesn't really matter all that much unless it's so bad that it actually attenuates the signal. But that's really bad!Second, the connector is the most important part of the cable. Since that is where the end of the fiber is and where the lite must leave the fiber, it has to be either clieved very well or highly polished so the signal is not refracted.All of this attention to detail adds to production so ultimatley, you get what you pay for. Paying $20.00 for a Monster cable is very reasonable. If you were to buy a professional cable you would pay close to $100.00, you don't see those cables on amazon."
5,Dont listen to this guy,"This guy doesnt know what hes talking about. When it comes to digital audio, even optical audio, the brand/quality WILL make a difference. Go do your research and you'll find Monster is the best brand for audio/video interconnects. Anywhere around 20 dollars for an optical cable is an excellent deal (especially for 8 feet), let alone for a high quality brand such as Monster.He even states, ""It's hard to imagine how one optical interconnect could be better than another."" Obviously, this man has no idea what he's talking about. When you're uneducated and havn't done research, you should not write a review that will influence other people's decisions."
5,Great Product and Great Price!,Had no idea how much of a difference that a Digital Fiber Optic Audio cable made. Most digital audio including HDMI and Component really sounds about the same but with Optic Digital the output is so much more intense. It's the best audio cable I have ever purchased!
2,Do the research yourself,"Don't listen to any of us.You already have an internet connection because you are here. Go to a browser and ask the question you asked here. You will find that any review that is NOT a store will tell you that ALL speaker wire is the same. They just look cool. If that's what you need, then buy it. Otherwise, stay away from monster. It's just like bose speakers.BUZZ word, that's all. These companies can't make any money selling you a 10 dollar cable."
2,I can't see how it would make a difference,"Why spend more for a top-quality optical cable with a brand name like Monster? In the digital realm, the bits are either getting to your amplifier, or they're not. It's hard to imagine how one optical interconnect could be better than another. Better cables matter when you are connecting speakers, but I can't see how they would matter here. So, buy something cheaper. Or, write another review, if you can explain to us consumers why this might be better."
5,ESSENTIAL PROGRESSIVE HOUSE....,"PLAYED BY EVERYONE IN THE KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF THE TUNES THAT CEMENTED BT'S SPOT IN DANCE MUSIC...HEAD FOR THE LUCID REMIXES FOR A SUNSET IBIZA FLAVOR OF PROGRESSIVE (AS PLAYED BY TIESTO), OR DANNY HOWELLS' SCIENCE DEPT. REMIX FOR A MORE UNDERGROUND FUNK-FUELED FEELING...TIESTO TURNS IN A DECENT MIX AS WELL AS ERIC KUPPER..."
4,One of the best in the series,"Morris rebounds from a weak streak with this entry in the House of Winslow series. Amelia as a woman who loves her family but can't help rebelling against them and God is like so many people. Phil's growing relationship with the Morino family is a little farfetched, but enjoyable. It was good that Morris handled the family evenly, it's too easy to make them a caricature. He still has the odd habit of overdescribing character's outfits, especially in odd places. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."
5,Very effective product!,"I've had Type I Diabetes for almost 50 years and now experience occasional weeping sores on my shins. This product helps them to heal within a day or so. I've used the cream for years because it's an effective moisturizer, but now find it very theraputic. It has a menthol feel to it, but doesn't burn - in fact, it feels great, especially on my feet. It's a great product!"
5,Good find,"Originally purchased at Long's Drugs and was disappointed when they stopped carrying it. Was happy to find it on Amazon. Good seller, good product, good price."
1,"Not as pictured, Received defective product?","The straps themselves seemed much too thin, and would not lock into buckle. The white stitching was missing, as if a single layer was used in place of triple webbing described on Highland website. In contrast to the straps, the plastic-coated hooks looked very good and solid, as did the heavy buckle. If the straps were anything like the described ""PowerWeb Plus with tubular edge design,"" I might have been very happy with the product. As I received it, I was very worried that it wouldn't hold 200 lbs, much less 500 pounds."
2,Not the greatest sauce out there.,"First off I would like to say that I am a huge fan of hot sauce in all different heat ranges. This sauce claims to have a one million scolville unit heat range, which is completely false advertising. I tastes like a generic tobasco sauce that you might find at a 99 cent store. The heat is similar to tobasco sauce as whell. If you like vineger based sauces you might like it, but it's not worth the price, plus shiping if you ask me. I probably would have given it a better rating if they hadn't lied about the heat. It's just nothing special, the sauce actually started turning black in my fridge, and I've on had it for a couple weeks. The taste got worse too, I have no clue why. I'll close by saying if your looking for a good tasting hot sauce with some real heat look elsewhere."
3,Andy Does it Again,"I love Don Knotts. He's great on the show. But the writing sometimes really urks me. Why oh why does Andy put up with Barney? Why does he never tell him off! Barney is useless, he's stupid, he lies and he hollers and screams all the time. When the G Men come in and tell Andy that a truck of gold was coming through, and it was to be kept completely secret, Andy goes right a head and tells Barney, knowing that Barney can't keep quiet about anything. Well, of course, Barney never listens to a word Andy says, and goes right ahead and starts talking. Goober is no better. His lips are never sealed, and they all talk, talk, talk all the time and soon the whole town knows. I picked this particular episode, though I've seen them all, because it's so obvious even when the stakes are high that it's Andy whose incompetent, not Barney. Barney is an obviously selfish jerk. Andy is just a jerk."
4,Corrected laugh track replacement discs now available.,"This set was originally released without laugh tracks on the following four episodes:Disc 1""Opie The Birdman"" and ""A Black Day For Mayberry""Disc 2""Opie's Ill-Gotten Gain"" and ""Up In Barney's Room.""If you purchased the set without laugh tracks, you can get corrected replacement discs from Paramount Home Video free of charge.Just send your name, address, telephone number, and the proof of purchase tab (found on the inside flap of the box) to:Paramount Pictures Home VideoBluhdorn 308A5555 Melrose AvenueHollywood, CA 90038You do not need to send your discs to them. Only the proof of purchase tab from the box is required.Allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery (but I got mine within 2).This is a major deal. Kudos to Paramount for taking care of this quickly. I won't hold my breath for the few minor corrections needed in the Season 3 set, though."
4,"No Laugh Track Makes ""Birdman"" episode seem ""meaner""","As several people have mentioned, four episodes on this set have no laugh track. For me, it had a strange effect. Usually when Andy comes back with a one-liner to put Barney in his place, it's funny. Without a laugh track, Andy's comebacks in ""Opie The Birdman"" come across as almost mean. Without the laughter I found it easier to focus on the character's expressions and boy when Andy tries to put Barney in his place I had never noticed the really ugly looks Barney gives him. In this way the absence of a laugh track changed the show in a subtle way I did not like at all. Made some of the humor seem almost mean-spirited.Paramout: I have one thing to say about editing footage in season three and now leaving laugh tracks off episodes in season four: Nip it! Nip it in the bud!"
5,One of the best,I purchased this for my parents 82yrs and 85yrs. The sound is greatwith a very Clear picture. They totally enjoy this. Best thingon television as far as they are concerned !
5,Still good old fashion t.v. watching!!!,"Just last night our family watched this. We all were laughing out loud. So nice to be able to sit down at home and watch some good, clean, fun shows!! Much better than alot of the smut you see on T.V. these days! We love the Andy gang!"
1,Shameful DVD release,"I was so looking forward to this season. These DVDs were to replace my 20-year-old tapes. I watched about 10 minutes of ""Opie the Birdman"" and was so disappointed I took the DVD out of the player and am returning the set to Amazon. The picture was worse than my old tapes. Furthermore, the episode, like all TV episodes that have a laugh track, is paced to allow for that track. The absence of the laugh track totally throws off the pacing of the episode. It's not a matter of ""needing to have someone to show you where to laugh"". It's a matter of being able to enjoy the episode with silence during the long pauses where the track is supposed to be played. The delicate pacing that is a hallmark of TAGS is completely thrown off by this absence."
3,No Laugh Track?,"I have just began Disc 2 and noticed no laugh track for at least 3 episodes. Granted that's not what makes the show, but it sure leaps out at you in spots. Was this a symptom of a rushed DVD? I would rather Paramount take their time, do it right and throw in some extras than get a scaled down version lacking even a laugh track...I'm very disappointed thus far."
4,Didn't disappoint,"THIS CD IS JUST WHAT I HOPED FOR ...GREAT SONGS, BEAUTIFUL VOCALS AND RELAXING JAZZ.IF YOU LOVED DONNY HATHAWAY YOU WILL BE LOVE HIS DAUGHTER!"
4,Great combo of talent...,"No one tickles those keys like Joe... and Lalah...well what can ya say about hersmokey, cool but mellow voice.This project has several cuts that will soothe the soul.If ya a smooth jazz fan, you'll thoroughly enjoy."
4,Lalah Hathaway has an incredible voice,"I have not purchased the album yet; am going to -- but have to say that the single that is out now, ""When Your Life Was Low"" is one of THE most beautiful songs I've heard in a while. It really hits your emotions; but Lalah's voice does that anyway. The song is so deep that I'm buying the album without having heard any of the other tunes. Lalah's vocal style is timeless--not trendy--and lovers of good music can truly appreciate this. Her father was blessed with a angel's voice and so was she."
5,Extremely Satisfied,This CD is a rare gem by two of Jazz music's legends; Joe Sample and Lalah Hathaway. I am very grateful and honored to receive this CD through Amazon. This is my new place to shop!
5,Outstanding CD!,"""The Song Lives On"" is a CD you will enjoy listening to from begining to end! Lalah's voice is mesmerizing..and Joe Sample isexcellent. ""Fever"" and ""Street Life"" are probably the songs heard on the radio, but my favorite is ""When Your Life Was Low"". This is one buy you'll be happy with!"
4,You will not stop playing it!,"I love quality music from passionate artists. These two make a killer combination. It soothes, inspires and touches you deep. Don't miss this one!"
5,Touches the Heart,"I was very surprised with Mr. Wright's review of this recording. Lala Hathaway?..boring?..what is wrong with this man's ears? ""When Your Life Was Low""...low aim?...I'm not sure what Mr. Wright meant by that one, because that song went straight to my heart. After hearing it, I thought, ""only someone who has had a broken heart could write those lyrics...and only someone who has experienced pain could interpret them the way that Lala did...""Fever""..unnecessary?...I am up on the floor each time I hear it...The only thing with low aim, is Mr. Wright's review of this recording."
3,responce to music critic,I can't speak for the entire CD because I haven't herd it but When your life was low is a very good song. Hot in Baltimore.
2,Very Average,Joe Sample Is a Genius But He has Gotten way to Predictable with Many of His Recordings over the Past Decade&a Half.I agree with Rickey Wright this is for the most Part very Boring&Bland.and Please Leave Street Life Alone that was a One In a Million Recording 21 years ago.You Just can't capture that Magic again.I Respect Lalah Hathaway she is a Good Vocalist but Compared To Randi Crawford she needs Lessons.this is Not for The Progressive Fan of The Crusaders but more for the Brunch Crew.Joe Sample can do These Runs in His Sleep.
2,"Ho-hum, ho-hum, ho-hum","I can appreciate the attempt, marry a legendary jazz instrumentalist with the female jazz voice of the moment Lalah Hathaway. This marriage is common law at best. Good music makes you think, great music elicits emotion; ""Life"", everyone's song of choice for radio airplay, gives pause if you've been involved in a similar situation or know of someone that has but come on, one song does not a CD make. The other ""Life"" song, ""Street Life"", is a classic that deserves so much better. When you redo a classic, even your own classic, you've got to really come with it. I'm still screaming for Randi Crawford and that image of Georgetown at 11:00pm on a Saturday night in June. Funny, I don't remember much more about this CD, hmmm. Thanks for the effort, it was the CD or a twelve pack of Heineken, should have gotten the beer and pulled out some old Joe Sample."
2,not bad.......for being made in 14 days,.... i have to admit its not as bad as other people say but you can tell it was made in two weeks. it features unknown artists. cuban link or any other person from terror sqaud arent even in the cd. its 13 tracks(really 12 tracks because 9 is just silence for 5 seconds) of just unkown artists. if you like big pun then buy terror squad the album or yeeeaah baby those are better cd's
1,This is GARBAGE,"I can't belive this CD was even on the market. Did it sell?? I thought that it was going to be a collection of Big Pun's songs on one CD. But Pun isn't even on the CD. It is horrible and if I was the heah of Pun's label, I'd sue them for everything they've got - unless they got permission. For anyone with a brain in their skull, do not purchase this CD. You will be putting it in the garbage faster than you even purchased the CD. R.I.P. Pun. ADR"
1,I can't believe they put this album out...,"Man, this album is WACK. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Big Pun - in fact, I respect him a whole lot and I liked his music, but this album is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the fact that Big Pun is gone. Trust me, all of the songs on here are horrible...I can't believe these people would sit there and screw with his songs. This is a digrace to Big Pun's music. Don't fall victim like I did to a ""heartfelt"" memorial of Big Punisher."
2,too campy,"I was hoping for a more serious detective story, but this one was total camp. If I wanted that, I'd see one of the other many 60's campfests. And Shelley Winters was real hard to take, as was Robert Wagner. If you want 60's stars in a romp, go back to It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad(?) World. I should have gone for Hud, or The Hustler. And, of coursse, for those of you who have yet to see it, Cool Hand Luke is the total masterpiece. Paul Newman at his best."
4,"""One of Paul Newman's best!""","I probably would give this movie a five star rating, but the age of itbrings it down slightly. I really enjoy it and would highly recommendit to anyone who used to enjoy seeing Humphrey Bogart in movies of thesame style. It's great fun and has enough surprises to keep you interested all the way through."
1,Harper,"An awfully boring inane movie. Deceptively using the star Paul Newman to carry what without him would have been shelved, taken out of print and most likely not have been produced at all."
3,Paul Newman is ice cool in Harper,"This is an interesting film. Newman plays Lew Harper who is kind of like a groovy 60's version of Phillip Marlowe; sardonic, tough, irresistable to women. While the movie is dated and sexist, it is well worth viewing, not just for Newman's charismatic performance but for some brilliant supporting roles. Janet Leigh plays his bitter estranged wife, Shelley Winters is poignant as a sloppy barroom slattern, Robert Wagner is a breezy, easy and amoral but hides an unexpected secret. Best of all is Lauren Bacall who purrs, growls and hisses in a scene stealing performance as the cynical woman who enlists Harper's services. Not a perfect movie but immensely entertaining."
5,"""Terrific"" Why no DVD?","Smart cool and funny. Newman at his sixties best. One of the coolest updates of the ""noir"" film. For the life of me I don't understand why Warner Brothers has not released this fim on DVD. I'll be first in line..."
3,"Newman Good, Plot Bad","I really enjoyed watching Paul Newman in this film. As always Newman found new life to breath into yet another classic role. Unfortunatly the fun ends here. I thought the plot of this movie was rather average. I suppose it wasn't really bad but it could have been so much more. Harper is a detective, who apparently needs some work. He finds it through a recomendation from an old buddy, locating a lost rich man for his jealous wife(she thinks he has run away with another woman). Many characters come into play as this mystery of the missing millionare starts to unravel and eventually Harper figures out he has been kidnapped by some of the low-lifes he had been consorting with. And the rest of the movie is downhill from there as it did not seem surprising or original. Additionally it was a slow picture. However, Newman is fantastic and for that reason this movie is worth seeing at least once."
4,"Not Bogie, but not bad","Paul Newman would be good doing a Tide commercial. As such, he does a good job in this movie. It suffers from Hollywood shortcommings, more than anything else - it was never destined to be a great film. It features a lot of excellent actors in some of their more forgetable performances; but, again, I don't think it's their fault. It's a pretty good movie that could have been a lot better. If you are a film buff, you have to see it. Just don't expect to be blown away."
4,Harper - The Private Eye returns !,"""Harper"" with Paul Newman is a great way to spend a quick 2 hours. Newman is surrounded by a great cast that includes Robert Wagner ( A very good role for him.) , Shelly Winters, Robert Webber, Julie Harris, Janet Leigh, Strother Martin, and Lauren Bacall. The screenplay, the first written by 2 time Oscar winner, William Goldman, is witty and fast paced. Some of the characters are quirky but the movie is fun to watch.I am a fan of the private eye films of Bogart, William Powell, Dick Powell, and so many others. For years, no Hollywood studios made a private eye film. The studios felt the private eye movie was ""old hat"". ""Harper"" marks the return of the private eye movie.Enjoy !!"
3,Eh its okay,"I got this at a garage sale for 5 bucks, it shaves ice okay but the handle on top that you have to turn to move the ice seems very week. It works, but I wouldn't recommend holding the little handle on top alone to turn the wheel. Not worth the price from pampered chef, I'm sure you could get something as good if not better from walmart."
2,"Tight fit, lining is poor.","The jacket is cut undersized, typical of foreign makes with poor quality control. The lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity. Exterior shell has nice feel, but overall, a poor piece of work."
4,A Parrot Heads delight,"I do enjoy this cd. Even though it isn't blue grass it has a tint of it in the music. I think the only reason why it even mentions blue grass is because thats what ""pickin' on"" is associated with. On the back it states ""down-home flavor to tropical folk-rock"" which is exactly what this is. If you are looking for nice background drinking music I suggest you purchase this."
4,INSTUMENTAL BUFFETT,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS CD. HEARING THESE BUFFETT SONGS AS INSTRUMENTALS WAS A TREAT. YOU CAN SING ALONG SINCE THE ARRANGMENTS ARE QUITE CLOSE TO THE ORIGINALS. THE LAST CUT ""A PIRATE LOOKS AT 40"" IS PARTICULARLY GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO PARROT HEADS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT."
2,"nt bad, but not Jimmy","it's interesting for most parrotheads, but stick to bubba himself. He's got this one beat!"
1,does sound like Muzak,"I have to agree that this is NOT bluegrass. ""Gone Phishin"", a bluegrass tribute to Phish, is actually bluegrass, this is not. I'd much rather just listen to the real Jimmy Buffett or listen to bluegrass. Really disappointing. Sorry that I gave it as a gift before listening to it."
1,Neither Bluegrass nor Buffett nor worth your while,"I've very disappointed with this CD. The idea--a bluegrass tribute to Buffett--is great! It's execution was not. There's nothing really ""bluegrass"" about this album. And it certainly doesn't do justice to the real thing. It's best described as Buffett meets Musak."
5,fins,"Fins is more like Pickin music. Because my husband uncle Bill from the Country Boys here in Virginia do this kind of music and they have there own CD I might add. Making Memories. and I love Jimmy Buffett. This is a good change of music, I think this should be replaced instead of elevator music. Good Idea, I think so."
2,Waste of time and money,"I have chosen this film because of the P G Wodehouse's wonderful book. When you read the book the language of this famous humorist does not permit you to stop laughing - and the problem of this film is that you can't even start laughing due to the absolutely idiotic scenario which is though basically follows the main line of the book shortens all dialogues and situations in such a way that it looks like you get just the contents of the book in a nut shell...The film producers flopped it though the actors tried to do their best in many ways looking like their characters.Besides, DVD was stopping from time to time being produced with errors.Do not buy it ever!"
1,Poor story,"This film is basically a day of two boys everyday life from when they wake up, play in the street and go to bed. Almost ten minutes of brushing their teeth in turn, another ten minutes when they bicycle around the street, a look around the premises of the school where the terrorists struck. One hour total.I am very interested in Russian film, and this was about the least interesting film I ever saw... No interesting points raised, nothing really about the incident in Beslan- just close up film of the two surviving brothers in ver simple everyday situations.Why make a film like this???? Not a documentary, not a good film, just 40 minutes of film of the two boys brushing their teeth, drinking tee, bicycling, visiting the school and going to bed."
1,The Dark Night of Recovery,"I personally did not get a lot from this book. However, I passed it on to others who enjoyed it."
5,The Dark Night of Recovery.,This book is excellent for us overly intellectual alcoholics. I was just on the verge of discovering some of this on my own and WHAM there it was. I can't say enough about it.Divine intervention or what?
3,"Nemo stickers, not so reusable","If your kids like stickers, then this is a nice set of stickers from the movie. But the reusable part is slightly misleading. After moving them more than twice, they don't stick very well, and they are only reusable if you stick them on the book's specially coated pages. I've found many kids expect stickers to stay stuck and sometimes get frustrated with this style of book. What kids love about them is the large, high-quality sticker pictures. The other Nemo stickers for sale (without books) aren't as nice, so buy more for the stickers."
4,Not Terry Kath,"A Great Band! I believe the guitarist is ""Al DeCarlo"". Al & Hawk were also in ""Bangor Flying Circus"" (Another Great Band)! Some very good listening>"
3,Madura sure did sound like Chicago without the horns!,I have the US release of this album and fire up the old turntable whenever I get a chance. It rocks!
2,QUITE A LETDOWN,"i was led to believe that the guitarist was terry kath, so i jumped for it and overpaid greatly. the guitarist is good, but definitely is not kath. and there's not enough guitar playing. the drummer is outstanding, the growly lead vocalist is good, as is the organist. the harmonies are kind of weak and i just don't know what the excitement is about this group. some of the writing and harmonies mirror Chicago and james william guercio is involved in this group as well, but i was greatly disappointed in the overall CD. it's not kath and not chicago."
3,"Not great, but not bad either.","I use this book for my clients to look at while picking their dogs new hair cut. The book leaves out some breeds but covers most, and has faily good drawings. There still are better books out there."
2,NOT TO INFORMATIVE,"NICE BOOK IF YOU ONLY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BATHE, TRIM EARS OR CLIP NAILS. DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT SIZE ATTACHMENTS TO USE OR WHAT PART OF THE BODY TO USE THE DIFFERENT ATTACHMENTS.ITS BETTER IF YOU HAVE A POODLE, MORE PAGES DEVOTED TO IT. ONLY ONE PER OTHER DOG!"
3,It's Not What I Expected!,"I had expected a clearer display of how to trim my wonderful Scottie who is too old to cope with trips to the groomer. I also have aged along with ""Miss Ferguson (Fergie)"" and find it very difficult to see all the little arrows showing the paths for trimming. After reading the material several times, I don't know if I will try to rely on the book, or if I will refer to the pictures I have taken of Fergie after professional groomings; or, perhaps I will try to use both, but am not really comfortable with either option!The Stone Guide to Dog Grooming for All Breeds"
5,great delivery time and condition as described,I already had checked this book at library and was looking for a good price. This book has good info and helps new groomers become familar with breeds and specific grooming for each one.
2,My Review,I didn't think that this book was very helpful at all. All the pictures in it are black and white and VERY basic. Their are ALOT better grooming books that you could buy.
2,the stone guide to dog grooming for all breeds by ben stone,"book in bad shape missing pages,I would not recomend using this book store!"
3,Took much longer than all my other orders& poor condition,"This book was in poor condition, it also took very long to get this book, infact it took longer than any order I have ever placed."
2,Fast shipping but I thought the book was a little out dated.,Fast shipping but I thought the book was a little out dated. I was expecting something a little more accurate for dog fancy. It is a very basic book for someone that is looking for really basic grooming tips.
2,"Great Book for Poodles, Not anything else","Not everyone has poodles, but this book seems to think they do. We have yorkies and there was only one page in the whole book on them. I made a big mistake buying this for my wife."
2,Not Very Complete,I found this book to be incomplete in showing exactly what to use for the groom...especially the non-shedding dogs...I did not care for it at all.........
1,dislike it very much!! returning it,"I'm a professional groomer, and was looking for a more up to date grooming book, it has great information on breeds. but not to good of information for clipping, and the so called Cat part... It's 1 page saying that handling is diff.. not the diff cat cuts you can do (what i was expecting)!! my book that is 6years old has more information about diff clips then this one does.. I'm very disappointed with this book and will be returning it.."
4,A surprising gem,"I recently found this underrated gem at Walmart. I have to admit I bought this for the 12-inch version of 'In Private', but I was pleasantly surprised to find that overall this is a consistent and enjoyable album. There are several standout tracks including the title track, 'Born This Way', the ballad 'Arrested by You', 'Occupy Your Mind', 'Nothing Has Been Proved', and and the club classic 'In Private'.The album, bathed in late-80s technology, has aged quite well considering techno music from the 80s doesn't sound so fresh in the millennium . Dusty's vocals are as good as ever, and her phrasing is impeccable as always."
5,Dusty in her finest hour!,"Why Dusty went away is a mystery? She has one of the finest singing voices with an enormous range. I love this compact disc. It has a great collection of songs for the time. While some singers can't move away, Dusty grows better with time and a different kind of music. It has a great soulful balance and it brings back a music legend and icon. Rest in Peace, Dusty. We still miss your angelic voice."
5,reputation & rarities,"This is a great album. Very emotional, beautiful songs and lively tunes combined to create a wonderful listening experience.Dusty Springfield's amazing career is captured in this album.. Dusty is one of a kind. There is no other voice but hers.Enjoy this album."
5,"Dusty's Swan Song, Unfortunately","Thanks to Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant (the Pet Shop Boys), Dusty's career was restarted in the 1990's.""Reputation"" was a keystone performance of her work with the PSB (besides ""What Have I Done to Deserve This"").I would have to search a LONG time to find a bad track by Dusty, and ""Reputation"" is no exception.Dusty was comfortable with several music genres, including ""Electro-Pop"", as evidenced by this album.No disappointments here!"
3,Reputation,"This is an interesting album from Dusty. It was released in 1990, her first new album in years. The best tracks are the ones produced by the Pet Shop Boys. Overall the best cuts here are ""In Private"" and ""Daydreaming"". The other stuff doesn't hold up as well to the Pet Shop Boys produced tracks, but avid fans will still want this release."
3,Not for people with intestinal disorders,"I really liked the product and the company, but I have Crohn's disease, and these sprouts caused me problems."
3,Good intro...,"As my first book and intro to Zen Buddhism I chose this book, so take the 3 stars w a grain of salt.I am 3/4s through the book and it feels authentic and you can feel the passion. Well written (with a few translation snaffus).An easy read which I think, so far, a good intro."
1,Just words,"This is No Easy Reader I find it unpleasant when you have to go back and reread to try to comprehend the thoughts. This book had words, but no recognizable thoughts, would not recommend."
5,This is not a book review.,"For those from a western cultural background, Zen falls somewhere between extremely difficult to impossibly inaccessible. We have such a hard time about it, It's not uncommon to dismiss the whole thing as a bunch of nonsense. One hand clapping? Trees in the forest? What the hell are these guys talking about? And why are they talking this way? Why are they being so difficult about the whole thing? Why don't they just tell us what it's all about?They did, but we couldn't tell. Due to conditioning, everything is placed in terms of logical dualism. Thanks to ego, it's hard to accept that our comprehension has limits.Overcome.Transcend.The questions are rhetorical.This first step has been a major hurdle, Intro to Zen has been incredibly helpful in getting started. It does exactly what it says it does. But is it Zen?"
4,chosen paintings shown several times,"I got this book for a class, and besides just using it for tests, I haven't opened it much. Most of the paintings in the first few chapters are also the same paintings in the last few chapters, though, and I thought it would have more variations. However, the info in each section is concise, easy to read, and the whole book is a great introduction for the beginner to the study of art."
2,World Stoner,"I'm dissappointed that I spent my money on this book. For a world traveler, Olsen is about as provincial as they come. He distrusts nearly all natives (except those with bongs to share) and encourages readers to travel to distant lands so they can hang out with other westerners and protect each other from the native population. Unadvertised as well, much of his tips relate to how live on $5 or less per day, which even most college students will find unappealling. His advice is overly simplistic and oft repeated.On the positive side, a few of his travel anecdotes are amusing and he is very enthusiastic about seeing the world. I recommend this book to anyone who's under 21, has no money and wants to get stoned in 19 different countries."
2,"Good if you are affraid, or simply curious about backpackers","Although I like the style of the author, direct, funny and full of personnal impressions and comments, I found this book quite innapropriate for wannabe travelers. Of course, I disagree with some of tha author's ""advices"" or comments... and of course I did not learn much reading his book... (and I doubt anyone who seriously thought about traveling would) However, I have to admit I would have loved to read that book in my late teenies and even my very early twenties. It is sometime disrecpectful, sometimes close to racism, sometimes just dumb... BUT it can help to motivate young people to find their way when they dream of a round-the-world travel. And lets be honest, most backpackers of the world share the same ""disrespect"" and ""foolishness"" as Brad Olsen... I am sure you can find better books than this one... but if you want to have an idea of what your road fellows might look like, read that book."
2,For First Time Travelers Only,"If you've ever traveled for more than two weeks in a foreign country - then this book will provide very little new insight. It covers only the very basics of travel - all the rather obvious learnings of ones first adventures abroad. The country/area guides are too vague to be of real use. However, if you are straight out of college, travel inexperienced, and looking for some general advice and practical tips in an entertaining (lots of cartoons) and lighthearted fashion - this might be a good pick. If you have any experience traveling overseas or consider yourself a mature traveler -- skip this book."
2,World Stompers: A Global Travel Manifesto by Brad Olsen,"I bought this book a couple of years ago on a whim. While the packing and work tips are great, Brad's personal stories are pretty lame. They all start off with him mentioning some chick or ""girlfriend"" he hooked up with. The actual information about each country is pretty superficial too. I would suggest the DK series travel books over this. More pictures, better info and you don't have to hear about Brad's sexual accomplishments."
4,Good for solo travelers,"This book is geared for younger, open minded travelers on shoe string budgets. I think the author has many great tips and words of advice for global ""stompers"" while offering such advice as budgeting, how to cut travel costs, where to be cautious, how to avoid getting scammed, tricks to protect your belongings while traveling, where the party scenes are around the globe, how to find legal marijuana and where it's ok (and not OK) to smoke it, where work is an option and how to go about finding cheap travel deals, etc. This book is for the kind of traveler that fits into the authors stomper sort of lifestyle but could be of value to any traveler. For some, this book will be a bit too liberal as you can see from the negative reviews. But overall, I'd say this is a very good book for a young person considering going out into the world and doing a little or a whole lot of traveling."
4,"Redeeming qualities of ""World Stompers""","I must disagree with some of the negative opinions expressed by other reviewers. This book is the one book I've found that encourages readers to go ANYWHERE in the world, including places in the Middle East and Sub-saharan Africa that even other similar books (like ""The Practical Nomad"") discourage. Olsen is humorous and incredibly supportive: it's ""you can do this"" all the way. At times he does get repetitive and/or lets his personal prejudices get in the way (he dismisses most of the United States as ""pretty damn boring""). Overall, however, this book is great-- very informative about black markets, visas, and other things that mainstream travel books don't usually tell you about. I lived in Germany and as a child and traveled a lot with my parents, yet I still found this book very helpful and enlightening."
1,Dismayed and Disgusted at the racism in this book,"I was totally DISGUSTED by the representation of Australian Aboriginals in this book as ""boisterous, boozin Aboriginals"". Let's lay on the sterotypes shall we?? To publish in a book sold round the world, the view that Aboriginals can be found ""boozin"" in any town in Australia, inclined to 'howl' that ""I wanna piss-up now, woman!"" is morally reprehensible at the least, and perpetuating yet more stereotyping, violence and black deaths in custody at the worst. This blinkered, narrow minded, patronising, attitude shows what little respect and sensitivity the author shows towards the cultures he visits, and I certainly wouldn't believe anything written except as the rambling of a little little man, let alone let it be my guide for travel."
2,A worthy teacher?,"It's disappointing to read about an enthusiastic world traveler's unashamed lack of sensitivity to the culture that he's visiting. Included in the author's comments on Egypt was an incident in which he and his girlfriend were kissing under the dome in a mosque, for which they got kicked out. The author recounted this incident as funny and seemed to show no remorse for his offensive behavior and lack of cultural understanding. You know, it might seem like a tiny point to some, but this is exactly the type of behavior that has led to the closing of many mosques and religious sites to non-believers. It seems the author himself still has many lessons to yet learn from his travels."
4,Recorded around 1971/72 but still sounds fresh,"I can remember buying the vinyl version when it came out in the early 70's and wearing out a copy by the I left school in 1976. For it's time it was and still is quite heavy with some storming covers including ""Born to be Wild"", and some of their early skinhead material, e.g. ""Know who you are"". A tender moment hears Noddy Holder providing a belch to John Sebastian's ""Darling be home soon"". From around 1971-74 Slade had numerous top 10 singles in the UK. Top stuff! Rock n Roll at its best."
3,ROCK AND ROLL SADE,I STILL LISTEN TO THIS RECORD FROM TIME TO TIME. GOOD ROCK AND ROLL DOESN'T FADE.
4,works.,"This does what it is supposed to do but personally I find that the protector really distracts from the look of the bottle. I guess that if I were to do it all over again, I'd just get traditional oil lamps."
3,"Definately the ""Darkest Childe""","My first review, inspired by an incredibly talented artist. This review allows a maximum of 1,000 words. How about 10? Sophie, we love you. More Music, less psychoanalysis... Collector's only."
1,WORST! DON'T BUY,"This was a complete waste of money. It's now a Legacy card. Don't buy, because they are trying to get rid of a stockpile. There are no good drivers for them. (it wont work in XP now either!)"
4,Outrageously Great Sound Card.,"Well, considering I have a windows ME that came with soundmax, this card rocks. I am a major gamer with playing First person shooter games like ""Soldier of Fortune"" and it helped the sound tremendously.This thing rocks!"
5,yeah for THX,"i'm a big ""techno-goober"" as one of my friends says. i love Fiber Optic Digital cables. to me it has the cleanest audio there is.i have this cable going from my Digital Cable Box to my Surround Sound system.in the past i had cables go out after a few weeks. so far so good. this one is tough. well built.and with Monster Cable, you always get what you pay for. so it might be a little expensive, but in the long run, you won't have to replace this ever week."
2,It works but...,"HOLY CRAP is it overpriced. Good god why did I buy this. Sound qaulity is the same as any other 3 foot cord you can find...Monster means nothing, just you pay more for their name, thats it. Go buy a non-branded cord off of ebay, please."
3,Just an optical cable,The connectors are too bulky to fit next to other connectors in the back of most receivers. Not necessarily worth the higher cost of Monster brand.
5,Truly amazing for the price,"I have a very good Yamaha surround sound system that cost me $500 about two years ago. It is an amazing system and I have always been pleased with the sound coming from it. Although, I was always curious about the quality being better because I was using a standard red and white audio cable to connect the TV's audio out to the surround system's audio in. A friend told me about using a fiberoptic cable and after seeing this one for around $15, I figured ""what have I got to lose?"" This was the best $15 investment I have ever made. As soon as I switched cables I heard an immediate difference. This is a must have for anyone who is looking for a great addition to their current home theater system."
3,"Good, but oerpriced",I own about 5 sets of these and these are no better then any of the others. In fact Monster are superior.
1,Piece of junk!,"Bought one of these cables on Amazon. After 1 week of use, it stopped working. Actually called a tv repair service and they diagnosed the monster cable as being bad. Unable to get refund! Junk I say!"
4,Quick Delivery,"Very quick delivery even with me being in a foreign country. Thank you.Sincerely, Rodney"
1,defective product,"This THX cable was sold as a brand new item...it came in a zip lock plastic bag and it did not work. I asked the merchant to send me a new one right away and pay for the shipping this one back and they refused...This is not a reliable merchant and they sell stock ""B"" products or most likely cheap imitations made in third world countries...I will not buy from them again..."
3,Stiff,Cable is a little stiff doesn't bend very easily. Put it on my blue ray player and has a good clear picture. Thanks
4,HOW BIG IS THE END????,"I'm thinking about buying this cable, but several have mentioned that the tip/end/handle is too big to fit with other cables. I need to plug in 2 side by side. Can anybody that has this cable, measure the diameter or circumference of the end? Please clarify which dimension you're providing. Is it round or oval? If oval, what are the two diameters?Is there really a diffence between a $5, $20 and $100 fiber optic cable? I'm seeing people in both camps.Thanks!"
4,The Warys of Judgment,An exploration of the foundations of governmental responsibilities. Its not an easy read. Its a worth while effort.
5,Loved it!!!,"I read this in about 4 hours all together and then read it agian, slower. Despite some forgivable mistakes, like calling Theo and Gainesmill Malkavians in a paragraph, though they are Brujah, this book is almost certainly the best fantasy i've read in a long time. I will be deffinately getting more books from the clan novel series, as this was my first one. I picked this oen because i've always had a passion for knowing more about the former promethian-turned-rebel Brujah and i was NOT dissapointed. It is also filled with wonderfully deatiled fighting seens, but i would sort of be called a gore-fan so i may be almost alone in my love for the descriptive killing. I learned of a new type of Shotgun and cartridge that i diden't know about and i got wonderful ideas for my own stories, which i post on the internet. All in all, this book is great for anyone above 11, who can appreciate sitting down for an hour or two and reading something superbly written"
5,IT'S AN OPEN INVITATION FOR ALL,"Come one, come all.........Chaka's new cd ""Come To My House"" is all that and much, much more! So all you Chaka fans, new and old, don't pass up this invitation by the diva herself to enjoy some new, classic, old funk over at Chaka's place. Tell one, tell all that Chaka is back and she is personally inviting you to come and experience a new kind of groove at her house. I promise you won't be disappointed, it will definitely be the drama of all time. Smile!"
3,Chaka Finds Lackluster Material,"I was disappointed after the first spin. But what you have read is true, this CD really does grow on you over time. Unfortunately, I have to skip over several mediocre tracks in order to hear my favorites. It's too bad Chaka couldn't land a decent distribution deal, the poor girl has had to pound the pavement to sell this disc."
2,Very few Chaka,"Prince, by then AFKAP, is behind, but probably no in total control. Good moments, like in title track. Also low points--some Chaka own creations, the duo with Queen Latifha. In general, very few presence of Chaka as the fabulous singer that she is. If you want a better choice get Epifany."
2,so/so,chaka khan deserves better material than this.aside from spoon everything else sounds dated and very run of the paisley mill.prince doesn't bring anything to the table on this disc.her voice has influenced countless others female&male but she hasn't been able to have that one incredible album yet.she has many tones but more often than not she is forced to over sing.she deserves her props in a big way.she is a genius and a legend.
4,Welcome Back Chaka,"Anything new from the wonderful voice of Chaka Khan is a real treat, and this album is almost a masterpiece. Her voice is as a wonderful instrument and her rich contralto has never sounded better. Spoon is incredibly sexy, and Drama is mesmerizing. The funky tracks really swing and the ballads are beautifully sung. My only caveat would be that some of the productions are a little stale. This is noticeable especially on Drama which is marred slightly by the intrusive drum machine.I would have loved to have heard more arrangements like those of Between the Sheets on the Fourplay album, and Miles Across the Room, where she benefits from a more sensitive context for her amazing voice."
2,"Are you sure it's not a Prince album, featuring Chaka ?","I must say this is a disappointing album. I had read marvellous critics about it and I maybe was biased, too exacting, or I expected too much. The fact is that this sounds surprisingly more like a sub-product (that is ""cheap"", because of its lack of imagination and quality) from the Prince organization than a Chaka Khan album. A lot of machines, artificial sounds, and very little harmony and voice. Chaka khan only starts singing on track number 10 (a long wait), though she does it remarkably from there to the end. The rest, as I said, is quite disappointing."
2,Disappointing,I love Chaka's voice and sometimes like Prince tracks. Not a terrible album but nothing special and not worth buying unless you religiously purchase Chaka or Prince-related material whatever it sounds like! The album's vocals are good and the music is ok but it doesn't come together as an album you will want to listen to.
3,COME 2 MY HOUSE AHAHAH COME 2 MY HOUSE PLEASE?,WELL I HAVE TO BEG PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO IT I LOVE CHAKA BUT GIRL WHATS UP? CAN I BE DOWN? MAYBE THE WIG WAS TOO TOO TIGHT WHAT WERE YOU THINKING TO LET PRINCE DO YOUR ALBUM? GIRL TOO MUCH PARTYING LIKE IT WAS 1999 RIGHT?
4,Garbo Silents,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Beware of low prices,"This item arrived on time and was shrink wrapped. I was really glad to have saved a bunch of money and the product looked unused. Unfortunately,disc one was marred by a scratch that wouldn't allow the player to proceed past about the 2/3 point of the film. Due to the low cost of the item it wasn't worth going through the return process so now I have only one disc that's fully functional."
4,ARQUETTE SHINES IN ABOVE AVERAGE THRILLER,"As TV movies go, this one is a notch above others, thanks to a fineperformance by Rosanna Arquette as an illustrator of children's bookswho finds herself in over her head when a serial killer takes over her life. Fine support by Anthony Perkins (his last film), D.J. Moffatt,and Will Patton in an amusing turn as the detective on the case. Thefilm springs some surprises, and the script stays on course. Arquettemakes you believe that human lives are at stake here. She stays insidethis character and inhabits it immaculately. Highly recommended!"
3,In The Deep Woods,"This movie dragged a bit. I will not toss this one, just because I like Rosanna Arquette and Anthony Perkins"
5,comfortables,I loved them when I received them! they are REALLY comfortable and cute! I recommend them 100%
3,Ok,"These were ok, but I felt like my feet slipped out of them too much. I thought that the straps would give more support, but they didn't."
5,great sandal,These were given as a gift and have been worn extensively so much so that the bottom has started to wear smooth I will be definitely be getting a second pair to gift away
3,Great book,"Okay, I have to say I haven't used this book at all since I've got it. Not because the book isn't great, but because I wasn't at this level of lunging when I purchased it. Now I am, but I've formed a good lunging work out with my horse that works for us, as well as using poles etc, and just haven't found use for it. I have a couple of the other 101 Exercise series (dressage and jumping ones) and find them good for the way they have great big diagrams that explain everything as well as a key/legend for things within the diagram that you might not know. I'm sure I will find good use for it eventually, but you probably don't need 101 lunge exercises - probably just a handful will do. Buying a good lunging book that helps you to lunge and offers good color pictures will probably be better to buy."
4,Valuable addition to any equestrian library.,"Spice up your ground work with this educational guide and develop a better relationship with your horse in the process. There are often days when we perhaps don't have the time to ride, but instead of just longeing around on the circle we could be more constructive - this book can help you. I find this book particulary useful when starting young horses."
5,Excellent training tool,The exercises in this are a great way to work an older and out of shape horse (like mine) back up to riding condition and improve on the basics. Well written and easy to follow instructions.
5,Wonderful,"I bought this book for my wife, and considering the price, the condition, and the timely delivery, it was awesome. She loves the book, and we will be buying many many more from Amazon, as well as this seller. Thank you for a satisfying online buying experience."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","I liked the first book I read by this author, but now I can see it is the same storyline. A middle-aged married couple. The man is dominant and the wife has no backbone. Through the entire book, I kept wishing the female character would stand up for herself. Finally, I got so bored I just skimmed through to the end. I won't be buying any more of her books. They are ALL the same. It's a shame, because Buchan is a good writer. She just needs to give her characters some personality."
2,The Good Wife Poops Out?,"I'm surprised at all the good ratings for this book, especially given how much better Revenge of the Middle Aged Woman is. I was really very disappointed in this book. The story creeps along at a slow snails pace, with details that seem intended to lengthen word count more than anything else. I didn't find much sympathy at all for the main character Fanny, and never really got to know any of the other characters enough to form in strong opinion either way. A weak and disappointing follow-up to Revenge..."
4,"Delicious, delightful, de-wonderful reading!","This is the third Buchan novel I've read so it's time to confess I'm a fan, and I'm not just waving air. This is a particular kind of wit that was inspired earlier by Fay Weldon and Buchan has done more with it. Buchan's novels are irresistable and mighty tasty reads. There's wit aplenty and intelligence as well as a worldview of interest. This one, ""The Good Wife"" has to do with a loyal MP's wife who, 20 years down the marriage pike, has to reassess her existence, her life, her marriage. It's quite good indeed.The other two Buchan books I enjoyed are: Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman and Perfect Love, this latter could have been somewhat shorter (editors note same). Buchan writes entirely fine novels but I dislike her titles which probably help her to sell well so I should shut up. I think the titles diminish the literary quality of the novels which is high."
3,The Good Wife Strikes Bad,"I also vote negative for the renaming of this book. It almost felt like predjuging an avarage American reader as incapable of raising interest in anything that does not include additional drama. Besides, there is very little drama going on between covers of this book so the change of it's title is completly unjustified.I've reached it's last page feeling unspeakably empty and knowing even less about Fanny Savage then when I started my reading. It's an easy but disappointing reading."
2,"Very, Very Disappointing!","I finished the book this morning, and I'm still waiting for the wife to 'strike back' . . . and she never does. She is a weak insipid character. During her 20 years of marriage she is a doormat to her MP hubbie - who cuts the honeymoon short due to work, isn't there when the daughter is born, asks his new bride if his alcoholic sister can stay with them for a few weeks - which turns into 20 years . . . you get the picture. So when ""Fanny"" finally gets some time to herself (after 20 years of thankless service to her husband and his political party) and goes to Italy for a few weeks, is this supposed to be the striking back part? Maybe British wives are more resigned to giving up their identity for the sake of the marriage - maybe they are just bloody fools. I don't know, but the book was a huge let down. The hubbie character of ""Will"" was not well flushed out, not well developed at all. . . don't waste your time with this one!"
3,So-so,"After throughly enjoying Revenge of the Middle-Aged Housewife I was very anxious to read this book. Largely it was disappointing. It was choppy, convoluted, and as one reader put it, the ""good wife"" did not strike back at all, but acquiesed to her rather annoying, boorish husband. I'll read Buchan again, but this was not one of her best."
4,Jump and go boom boom!,"Move aside Ricky Martin, Latin sensation Chayanne is back in the limelight and with this single, he might well be ready to crossover to the mainstream market. Chayanne fuses a blend of uptempo beats with genuine Latin-flavoured styling (the trumpets, the drums) and packs Boom Boom in a very dancable and funky set. Listen once, and there is no way you will sit down not wanting to get up and ""shake your bon bon?"" *pun intended* Best of all, Boom Boom is just good the way it is without being in English. Spanish words for Spanish songs. That's the real Latin invasion."
5,The classic work on Romans from the prince of expositors,Many years ago I had the privilege of hearing the tape recorded messages of Dr. Barnhouse as he taught this series on Romans over the radio. It made a lasting impact on my life. I have conducted a verse by verse study of the book of Romans several times and find this work indispensable. Dr. Barnhouse's rich commentary and unforgettable illustrations are like none other. This set of commentaries is a must for every preacher's library.
4,Shearing Hits the Right Notes Again,"I completely disagree with the other review of this CD. This CD, in my mind, is a must for you bachelor pad / retro cocktail party. I have well over 1,200 albums from this genre, and this one fits in nicely. If you are looking for a ""pure jazz"" CD from Shearing, don't buy this one. However, if you are looking for background music for your next cocktail party...ice-up the martini glasses, polish your shaker, and throw this one on the turntable (CD player). By the way...don't other reviewers know that you can listen to sound samples before you buy a CD?!?!"
4,Solid 'Shearing Sound',"Superb set by this master musician who is not given enough credit for his superb arranging skills, particularly for strings in the modern jazz idiom. Although the music can serve as classic 'cocktail party' mood music, if you stop and really listen to it and its equally magnificent sister set, 'Black & White Satin,' you will understand why its no coincidence that this is the same man who penned the theme song for the original jazz club named after Charlie Parker, 'Lullaby of Birdland.' His writing, along with that of Henry Mancini, to name another, did as much as anyone to saturate the mainstream in the 1950's and 1960's with the ideas and innovations of the Parker-Gillespie modern jazz movement. Bravo! George"
1,Not the best Shearing at all,"This one isn't worth the price. In fact it isn't worth having.I sent my copy back.The sound is dismal, the arrangements don't do Shearing justice.It's a disaster."
3,Flawed but worth watching.,"This was,I believe, originally a CBS special. I think the crew only hung around a week or so. Mr. Cash never sounds comfortable in front of the camera. Or maybie he always talks like he's being interviewed. And I must mention the sound and picture quality leave a lot to be desired. A poor mans Don't Look Back.Nevertheless, if you are a hard core fan of the man in black this DVD is essential. There is concert footage of Johnny along with the Carter Family and others. There is Johnny in the studio and a duet with Dylan. Incidently nearly everyone is less stiff than Johnny. I think a filmaker would have to follow him around for a couple of months before he would relax much. Oddly enough the most relaxed people seem to be the non celebrity's. If you are looking for a documentary masterpiece then pass this one by. If your a Cash completest then this film is indespencible. Fanatics of Dylan, the Carter Family or 70's Country then you will want this. Otherwise I'd leave it alone."
4,Nice elementary reference with examples.,This is a good reference to have handy for those who do not regularly write but yet critique the writer's work. It is easy to understand and contains examples.
2,Those are SEQUINS!,"The design on this shirt is actually larger than shown, and is all in SILVER SEQUINS, not embroidery. Sequins were not mentioned in the description or discernable from the picture. When I lifted it from the package, several sequins fell off. I was very disappointed."
4,At Rock Bottom tops eventful year for Scrappy,"Scrappy Hamilton, of Asheville, NC, has become quite a force on the fledgling Asheville music scene. Their first album, At Rock Bottom, shows thet an independent release can maintain high levels of quality both in musicianship and in audio engineering. Scrappy's songs are reminiscent of a more gilded age, but maintain a very fresh sound. Creative impetus and guitarist, Scott Kinnebrew leads this beligerent new band out of the cellar and into your mama's lap with his rascally lyrics. Walker Young, Bill Smith, Mike Alexaneder, Isaac Stanford, and Aaron Spears round out the sound of these eclectic ragtime groove monkeys."
5,Game changer,This book is a practical tool to help you to work through fear based issues that hold you back from becoming what ever you want to be or what ever it is you want to achieve. Great straight forward approach. I found it immensely helpful and worth re-reading several times.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY.,"I bought this CD player about four months ago, and although it worked okay, it ate up batteries and skipped a lot--just walking would trigger it. This CD player is NOT AT ALL good for jogging or working out, because you won't even be able to hear the music with any movement. After dropping it once, it stopped playing ANY CDs, responding with ""NO DISK."" This product is a complete waste of money, and now I can't even return it because my warranty up. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
2,Confusing,The book is not in order. The author jumps around to different times and places that are hard to follow. I guess I expected something different.
4,"Natural, Soothing and Relaxing","Natural sounds recorded with incredible clarity, paired with modern renditions of Native-American music. Whether played at higher volume and listened to carefully, or at a lower volume as background mood-music, this is entrancing. I like to listen on headphones while sitting in a comfortable recliner with my eyes closed; what a great way to un-wind at the end of a stressful day. The music is enjoyable listening at any time. Disc plays back in Circle Surround sound for a full auditory experience. Very enjoyable."
4,are you mandan enough to listen to this?,"i was bored, but i attribute that to the habit of having a traditional western mind set rather than a calm reflective state of mind. i also live in the teeming metroplois of pennsburg, PA and i think this cd is best listened to at night, outdoors, under a full moon, far from city lights, perhaps in a forest, or in the desert, or along the lapping waters of a distant shore."
3,There are better war movies,"The DVD transfer is very good with detail intact. Black and White""In Harm's Way"" picks up where ""From Here to Eternity"" leaves off but that's as close as this big epic from Otto Preminger gets to James Jones.If you like John Wayne movies, then I can recommend this film to you. However, if you are looking for a riveting WW2 story, it's not here. There's too many side plots and none of them really contributes to the main storyline which is the story of the first year of the U.S. Navy's response to Pearl Harbor. It's mostly Wayne and Kirk Douglas. The best performance belongs to Patsy Neal, appearing here as a nurse and companion to the Duke.Recommended for: John Wayne fans, WW2 movie fans. Some sexually suggestive scenes including rape which means not for young children."
2,Couldn't View DVD,"Without realizing it I had purchased a Region 2 version of this movie. There was no listing of it being a Region 2 when I selected this movie. In the USA, only Region 1 will work on my DVD/VHS player. I had another company inform me of this problem before he sold me a movie. Because of learning about this fact we cancelled that order and he refunded my money. How considerate of that person to be so honest. I consider the company that sold me In Harm's Way (Region 2) was really only interested in making money and, not caring about the customer. They should have been aware of the difference. This was a Christmas present. Can you imagine how disappointing it was when we couldn't view this movie?"
5,Great Oldee,Just a great movie with star packed cast. a much needed add to anyones collection. No loose situation with this movie!!!!
2,Anachronisms Galore,I walked in while my significant other had this on; some blonde chick was go-go dancing around a swimming pool at a party (obviously drunk) and this morphed into pole dancing. With go-go 60's music. How can anyone take this seriously? It was set pre-Pearl Harbor. Anachronisms galore. Two stars for that alone.
5,"a five star john wayne movie,for non fans a three star war movie","wayne is the whole show here so if you like him you'll love this 165 min. epic about the war in the pacific. starting with pearl harbor and going about 2 to 3 years into the war. most of the action happens off screen and the movie plays more like a soap opera than anything else,but like i said if you love wayne you will like this movie. give it a try."
3,The present VHS format does no justice...,"I experienced this unusual ""war movie"" when it was first released in the mid 60's at one of Hollywood's movie palaces, presented in widescreen and multi-channel sound. The combination of Jerry Goldsmith's stirring musical score and the slam-bang sound effects, in combination of the pristine black and white cinematography of Loyal Griggs cry out for the release of this Otto Preminger masterpiece onto a DVD format complete with 5.1 digital sound. It will THEN deserve a magnificent Five-Star rating! Am I (and many others) asking for too much?"
4,Gripping War Epic with the Duke,"I almost stumbled about this in the german Nightprogram and now have purchased an original DVD.This is a rather long, however never boring, WWII epic starting from the events of Pearl Harbor to a first victory in the Pacific in a definitely fictious ""Skyhook"" battle with amphibian landing and a final Sea Battle.Starring John Wayne, Kirk Douglas and the great Patricia Neal,i really love this movie, not because it offers so much action. If you look for this, you are better served with Midway, Tora, Tora, Tora or in the new generation Windtalkers and Thin Red Line. This is more about people at war, still trying to have lives of their own and not being fully consumated by the fury.Next to the three stars mentioned there are also Burgess Meredith, Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews, Brandon De Wilde (the Boy from Shane) and George Kennedy as big names."
5,One of my favorite John Wayne war movies,This movie is so much better in its uncut version that the diluted version that is so often shown on TV that you've got to buy this movie.There is some real character development and action in this story...perhaps the most poignant is the relationship between Wayne and his on-screen son.Solid performances all the way around.
1,Typical John Wayne Fluff,"I was turned off by this flic in the opening sequence, during which a young lady, dressed in typical '60s attire, danced in a typical '60s style to a '40s tune. So much for historical accuracy. John Wayne played John Wayne; Fonda played Fonda, and Meredith played Meredith. Preminger gave us all of the usual cliches, but seems to have been unaware of the importance, or even the existence, of the aircraft carrier. This is definitely a B movie, and I would recommend it only to die-hard John Wayne fans."
1,One of the worst movies of all time!,"Midway tells the story of the Battle of Midway, using lots of real war footage. Unfortunately most of the film used was just stuff they had lying around the cutting room floor. If you watch closely in one seen what is supposed to be a diving Japanese Val is in fact a German Stuka. The best is at the end of the film, when Chuck Heston crashes on to the deck of the Carrier, the footage they used was of a Korean War Panther Jet! Absolutely hysterical!"
3,The Last Blast of the Big Gun Navy,"As an avid reader of history, I classify this movie as a guilty pleasure. It grabs your emotions and takes them for a heck of a ride. It has a strong cast, a great multi-layered soap opera plot, exciting action scenes and fabulous black and white cinematography.It is also a total joke as history. Watching this movie you would never realize that the U.S. and Japanese navies fought their major battles with carrier based airplanes. So if you like battleships and bombast, this movie is for you."
1,DVD won't play,I bought this before surgery and when I tried to play it I got a message stating: Region Error Playback noy authorized in your in your region. Never have I seen this message! HELP!!!!!!!!
2,"TOO long, soap opera, little battles","Crazy long, was more of a ""relationship"" movie versus a war move. Well acted, but not what I expected. I was tempted to turn if off many times, but believed it redeem itself very soon. The ending battle was good, but after 2 hours, a 10 minute (or less) battle wasn't enough for me."
5,Great classic movie,"One of the most intense WWII movies ever made...superb story, classic acting by classic actors, awesome direction by Otto Preminger."
5,One of the great war films,"This film depicts good and bad, how battles are one or lost, and usually by bravery, not by cunning nor knowledge nor power. One wins a battle or war because they have to. Actors are gone now, principles still around, When America is at its best, is when things are at their worst."
4,in harm's way,I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in 1970. I had just been discharged from the navy and really liked the duke and Kirk in this movie. Excellent!
2,"Title should be ""In Love's Way""","This is NOT, repeat NOT, your typical John Wayne movie. It is NOT even a war story despite the title. It is a love story. In fact it is multiple love stories with WW-II in the Pacific as a backdrop. This is a reversal of a war story with a love subplot to keep the female audience interested: The war backdrop in this movie is intended to keep the male audience interested. Not only that, but it is lacking in a number of ways, beginning with Douglas's character -- an officer who is constantly in trouble, including starting a bar room fight, and still remains an officer in the military. The ship models for the battle scenes are not accurate either."
4,In Harm's Way,"This movie captures in a small way the reality of the war in the pacific, without overindulging in either the actual events or the actual homefront heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the drama is strong. Being filmed in black and white also adds to the atmosphere, and helps lend an air of authenticity to this complete fiction, without taking away any of the feel of the era. This is a clasic ww2 story."
2,MISUSED TALENT,"When this movie was released, Otto Preminger himself appeared in the trailer, stating that he wanted to depict the human drama of the American fighting man's recovery from defeat at Pearl Harbor and his eventual turning of the tide in the Pacific. Great idea for a movie, but the producer missed his mark. Why didn't this movie make use of the real places and drama? Though there are great stars, stark photography, and a Goldsmith score,it badly misses the mark. The sea battle is pretty clearly meant to be in the Solomons, but is irritatingly disguised with fictional names for islands. The battles themselves are portrayed in a non-realistic fashion. Too bad. The real ones were marked by great courage and luck. The ships very much look like the models they are. How about the story? Plenty of melodrama, a sort of Peyton Place set in the South Pacific. If you're a history buff with any interest in WWII, you will be disappointed."
5,war movies,Standard for Wayne...heroic military man. Some surprises from Douglas' character. Very good telling of story related to WW II in the Pacific. Worth watching over and over.
2,World War II Melodrama with 1960's hairstyles.,"A long and tedious WW2 soap opera that strives to be an epic love story and gripping War drama ala ""From here to Eternity."" Where it succeeds it is also let down by implausible plotting and some phony heroics near the end when Kirk Douglas seeks to redeem himself following the suicide of a girl whom he raped and throws his fate to the wind in an against all odds mission in the service of his country. The movie simply loses credibility on that scene alone. Some decent acting by all involved doesnt elevate this film any higher than a bloated attempt at oscar nominations."
3,Not As Good As MIDWAY,"IN HARM'S WAY is a film about World War II naval action in the Pacific beginning with the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. The movie contains a lot of battle scenes but it soon gets monotonous - especially when one realizes that model ships are used as props.John Wayne is the star and the supporting cast is strong. Patricia Neal and Kirk Douglas are standouts. In spite of the superior acting and the efforts of Otto Preminger as director, the film never quite achieves the same level of interest as MIDWAY which is definitely a better motion picture.IN HARM'S WAY received an Oscar nomination in 1965 for Best B & W Cinematography."
5,Add this one to your collection!,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. One that I watch over and over. I was also a bit surprised at the negative comments made about this movie. Given the time period in which it was filmed and the lack of technology as we have today, I felt it was excellently done. The storyline which involved the newlyweds (Paula Prentiss playing the wife) was a bit underplayed, but the emotions of a couple torn apart by the effects of war are the same for all couples, then and now. The star studded cast (including such then-newcomers as Larry Hagman, Carroll O'Connor, George Kennedy, etc.) were excellently portrayed even in bit-parts and the dialogue never once lagged or strayed. In my opinion, Kirk Douglas was and is so versatile at his craft that he can make any role believable. His acting was superb particularly in the rape scene. This movie is a classic and one which every household should have in its film library."
2,Play Battleship Instead.,"Producer Otto Preminger doesn't have time for emotion and he doesn't tolerate any in his actors, even when a young ensign finds out his fiancé committed suicide or another lost his son. They don't even get misty-eyed. Music that reminds you of whales suffering indigestion or flatulence is supposed to add to the suspense just before the battle. Some of the battle scenes look like they were shot in a bathtub. The captain of the cruiser in which part of the film was shot wanted to throw Preminger overboard several times. (Why didn't you, Skipper)? The actor who played the ensign also played the boy in ""Shane."" Even greats like Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal, Burgess Meredith, Tom Tryon, and Paula Prentiss can't keep this movie afloat.I'm on a roll of bad war movies. Play ""Battleship"" instead."
3,Classic John Wayne,"While the special FX are rather weak, the story and acting are excellent. This was the second time Wayne and O'Neal teamed up. They play off each other very well. Kirk Douglas plays an awesome supporting role. And the list of other supporting actors is terrific; O'Conner, Prentiss, Andrews, Meredith, Kennedy, and so on. I'm a John Wayne fan. This is another must see for fans like me."
5,Great Oldies!,"WE MADE A TRIP TO HAWAII... AFTER VISITING THE ARIZONA MEMORIAL, I HAD TO HAVE AN OLD FAVORITE! I WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND IT, AND EVEN MORE TO WATCH IT!!"
3,Good movie not great service,One of my favorites. Entire cast is excellent and story holds up. I wish vendor had better informed us that this was a PAL only version and would not play in the USA. (We sent it to a friend in Ireland.)
3,The War in the Pacific,"In Harm's Way tells the story of America's naval involvement in the Pacific, beginning with a very effective, detailed presentation of the Pearl Harbor attack. John Wayne stars as a Navy captain that is reinstated to lead the charge against the Japanese, and Kirk Douglas is his irresponsible, self-destructive commander. Both stars give solid performances, as does Patricia Neal as the nurse that falls for Wayne. They have a very believable relationship that is a highlight of the film. The supporting cast is incredible, and although there are a few too many threads in the story that sometimes distract from what is going on, it never gets boring or loses course. This is the kind of big filmmaking we don't see enough of these days, with a story and stars that are larger than life, combined with drama, action, and humanity."
5,the movie In Harm's Way,What more needs to be said? Its John Wayne! the service in getting the movie was quick easy and inexpensive. that's correct..... Pilgrim!
5,john wayne - what else?,"i enjoy old time hollywood actors like wayne, douglas, meredith and fonda. one of few movies with jill haworth. good shootum up and lots of fringe hollywood stars (even archie bunker). some say this film is over-long. in the context of war, this film is very short. douglas is a love him/hate him charater in this film and does a fine job of it. see his sinister looking face when he stares at haworth just before he is about to ... (can't give away film), yet, douglas can't for the life of him key a microphone when using a two way radio. that's a huge flaw in a film depicting combat reality. if u love war movies, this will do fine but it is not a ""private ryan"". you will find the special effects wanting. for its time, it does hold up. over- all, this is typical hollywood glossy."
5,i truly enjoy the dvd,iam know the film but when i tried to play the one sent to me it said cant be played in this area. i returned the dvd and would like to have one i can play
4,Good...wish I bought it earlier,This pillow is excellent for babies---I bought it for my 7 month old when I noticed her head flattening and after a month I can see a big difference.A must buy!
2,Not as good as they used to be,"I have bought a number of these Hagerty storage bags to hold my various silver pieces. Unfortunately, none of them keep the silver from tarnishing, but they are good for keeping them dust-free. They come in various sizes and hold all my different pieces - from simple bowls/platters to champagne buckets.Silver bags actually used to keep silver from tarnishing. They just don't make things like they used to."
1,Disappointed,"My father,my sister,my nephew,my daughter,my son,my mother, my grandmother and myself were Very Disappointed.This was a Brithday gift for my 81 year old DAD."
5,Volume 4; worthy conclusion,Volume four takes the heroes through more fights and battles to a final showdown with the villains and a resolution of what they've been fighting for. A worthy conclusion to a great philosophic adventure.
4,Worth the free price,Good read. The mystery/suspense element added an interesting dimension to what would otherwise have been just a straight romance novel.
3,don't know,Oh I don't know - it didn't leave any lasting impression - nice tale i guess but pretty impression less - read it to the end tho.
3,ok,"this book was ok, i wouldnt have paid money for it so for a free book it was good. cant complain to much for it being free"
3,Fast Read,"It was OK, storyline had a little mystery going on in the background. Could have done without the F-bomb being used, story was steamy enough on it's own."
3,Mystery,"The story wasn't bad, I wasn't expecting a murder mystery, I guess I should have read more before I purchased."
4,Good book!,"Much more steamy than I thought it would be. Kind of a predictable ending, but was a good read. Definitely a chic book."
3,Raspberry Crush Review,"While this book was okay, I found it really hard to get in to and I felt it couldn't decide if it was a romance or a mystery."
1,In case you need instructions,I think there was a mystery plot in this book. It got lost in the page after page after page of the details on How to have sex. I had to click over multiple pages of nothing but explicit sex. I call this book pornographic reading. I will never read another of her books. I happen to know how to do the act.
2,Raspberry Crush,"Star crossed lovers return home at roughly the same times. Neither Billy Cabot nor her ex husband Seth is looking to rekindle anything, quite the opposite. Billy is rebuilding her life and finding a new love. All it takes is for Seth to walk into the bakery where she works for old feelings to reignite, though it is the last thing she wants. Her current love is nice and safe, Seth anything but safe. Fate throws them together when Billy is convinced that what appears to be an unfortunate death is murder and Seth becomes her partner in detective work. Partnership expands to new levels, naturally.The mystery does take a back seat to angsty romance, but there is a humorous element and small town charm that will appeal to many.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
3,mystery or not?,"I got this book for free, so I thought why not give it a chance?This is also the first book I've read from this author.I;m really not used to reading books with a lot of sex in them. I has to skip over those parts in this book, which was many many pages. I did however like the mystery aspect of it. I just wish this author would choose which she wants to wriue about. Sexual romance encounters or mystery? I think she should stick to romance because the mystery part of this wasn't to complex and was predictable."
2,not my cup of tea,"This book was a little too racy for my taste. If you like soft porn, I guess you may like it. I found myself reading with one eye open. LOL The mystery line was very unrealistic in my opinion. It is a shame; I did like the main characters. It could have been a good book; if a little more thought was put into the plot and the pages of TMI (Too Much Information) was left out."
5,"It's Monster, what else can you say?","As with all Monster products, these is a super nice cable with high-quality, over-built plugs that look and perform great."
5,BEST KEPT SECRET IN JAZZ,"It simply does not get any better than this. I believe the late, great Billie Holliday would sit and listen to Carolyn Leonhart..... if she were still with us. On the first listen, this became one, if not the, favorite selection of a vast jazz collection that goes back to the 30's.Will somebody with the ability to do so please shine the spotlight on this great talent?"
1,Didn't work,I didn't realize when I bought this movie that it wasn't going to work. It wasn't til I received it that I found out the disc wasn't made for the u.s.
5,Great Buy,This was a great purchase experience. Item was exactly as described and came in a very reasonable amount of time.
1,Hated it,"My opinon on this movie believes that it shouldn't be a movie. The character design was very blah- although I did enjoy Gnorga The evil Queen of the trolls. The character that got on my nerves the most was Gus. (The little, fussy kid that was spoiled rotten to the core.) I usually like watching movies where i enjoy the main character- but this movie only made me hate him. I was actually glad at the near end when something bad happens to him- too bad it didn't last. The songs didn't appeal to me either. The little kids I know aren't fans of Don Bluth- and obviously- neither am I. If I were recommend a Don Bluth, The Secret of Nimh was pretty well done. It could be that I saw the wrong Bluth movies, but i'm tellin ya this isn't a 5 star, 4 star, or 3 star movie. Show your kids, or watch a a movie worth your while! I recommend not wasting your money on this one."
2,Poor troll,"I had seen this movie when I was a kid...I didn't like it. I've re-seen it as an adult...I still don't like it. The story is weak. It starts off strong (as if it's going to develop), but it doesn't. The troll is sent to the human world, kids find him, they sing songs,and so on. The story drags, and by the end you could careless about what happens to the troll. I think one of the reasons I never cared for this was because I compared it to Bluth's other films. I loved Land Before Time, Thumbelina, All Dogs Go TO Heaven, heck, I even enjoyed Rock a Doodle...but this? Not so good. It's as if he had run out of imagination when creating this stinker. It has more of a made for TV feel to it...not really movie theater worthy. However, the songs are awesome! The bad guys are probably the most interesting characters...But, if it keeps the kids silent for an hour and a half who am I to judge."
1,F-,This film is like junk food for your brain.It is also Don Bluth's worst film ever.it's incredibly stupid and has nothing but fillers in it.This Movie talks down to kids and offers nothing back.The characters mainly(The Troll & the kids)are annoying.The plot makes zero sense and it resemblance to an over-the-top parody of kid's film.The ending is super confusing and it's message that dreams come true when one just dreams alone rather then working for it is just plain dumb.This film is Ed Wood bad and only your wall should be allowed to see it. I give this movie a 0 out of 10.
2,Leave us alone Don Bluth!,"Let me put it this way to Mr.Bluth, STOP MAKING MOVIES! and this one is really the reason A Troll In Central Park. Dom DeLuise sucks for being the voice of a cute troll, the only one that is really does good job is Loris Cleachman (A former villian in Mel Brooks films like High Anxiety, History of the World part1 and Young Frankenstein)for being the voice of a bad troll witch,and the children look retarded and the movie has unforgettable songs that makes you wanna puke, made from the guy who wrote the songs for Thumbelina and All Dogs go to Heaven. And Don Bluth did an cheap job on the animation, An American Tail and The Land Before Time make sense and have good animation. Is it because of Spielberg or Lucas? If you wanna see a good Don Bluth movie. Watch an American Tail instead."
4,to remember the great band that once was!,"Faith No More went a tad underground in their last few years. Here's a great way to remember the years of fnm mainstream! the days of neon colors and guitar solos, going up as far as ""ANGEL DUST"". You even get to check out the really old videos from the days of ""WE CARE A LOT"" and ""SURPRISE, YOURE DEAD!"" get it! GET IT NOW!!!"
3,Without my Love of Faith No More: 1 star.,"Faith No More's music is SO MUCH better than these early videos. 90% of this tape is full of late-80s/early-90s weird and goofy videos. The best video BY FAR is the very last one: a live Mtv performance of Caffeine (awesome). I recommend the ""Who Cares a Lot?"" video compilation more than this one. Some of these Croissant videos are on the 1st half of the WCAL set, including Caffeine, and the second half of WCAL rocks way more.PLAYLIST: Midlife Crisis, Epic, Falling to Pieces, Anne's Song, We Care a Lot, Suprise! You're Dead!, From Out of Nowhere, A Small Victory, Caffeine."
2,Poor photography,This otherwise good show by good musicians is spoilt by bad photography jumping around more than the band do and making it irritating to watch. You don't see anyone only catch glimpses of people or scenes for a second or less.
1,Crazed TV director blew a no-brainer band shoot,"Doesn't meet the minimum standards of viewability. The director must have have a nervous breakdown. Music is great, video unwatchable. Pointless cuts that last lesss than a second. No brainer shoot blown by a tv director with no talent for concert video"
5,Great Concert Video,"One of the best concert videos I've seen. I love the music, the song selections, the lighting - it's all fantastic."
5,UB40 - Homegrown in Holland Live,"UB40 is one of those bands whose live performances far exceed their recordings. The UB's rely on musicianship, not stage gimicks. This DVD is an excellent capture of the band in Holland where they are very well known and very popular. The set list contains some of the bands early songs (One in Ten / Present Arms / Food for Thought) as well as later hits on the continent and the states (Red, Red Wine / Here I Am / Kingstontown). It also contains some extras that give alot of insite about the band. As to some of the reviews about the photography, yes, there are quick takes, but the for the most part it is fine video. I bought the DVD inspite of the negative comments, have watched most of it more the 100x and love it. It would be extremely boring to have a still shot of the band for the whole concert. I would highly recommend this DVD to any ub loonie, reggae fan or anyone new to reggae. For the loonies, check out Norm's message at the start of ""Rat."""
5,"Awesome timepiece--fine jewelry, too","I'm a huge fan of wristwatches in general and Swiss Army Victorinox in particular. When my wife said she wanted a new watch, I was delighted to find this one on Amazon.com. It is a stunning piece of jewelry that does an outstanding job of keeping time. The mother-of-pearl face is brilliant and colorful. The case and bracelet are flawlessly crafted. She loves it--and so do I. She has received many compliments on it already. She says it's the perfect size--large enough to see without squinting but small enough to exude femininity. You can't go wrong with Victorinox, quality watch makers with a sterling reputation."
3,This is not light reading.,If you order this think in terms of ordering a graduate school textbook. If that is your level of study great!
3,Not the best sound,"The video arrived in good time - ~1 week. The description said the video was in ""like new"" condition however, the audio is a bit scratchy. This is understandable for an old VHS but it should not have been labeled as ""like new""."
4,curses inc,Overall it was a good books there were a lot of stories that i loved a couple that i liked adn 2 that were not the best but if youre a vande velde fan its a good book.
4,Bubble Bubble ... Great Witch Tales,"One of the books I picked up recently was a collection of short stories by Vivian Vande Velde called CURSES, INC. This is a collection of stories intended to be released as WITCH'S BREW, but suffered from a title change.The stories in this collection generally concern witches and spells. I found the tales to be very entertaining. Some of the stories like Skin Deep, start out along familiar paths but end in an original manner. Original endings are par for the course with these stories.One story, Witch-Hunt, is so close to reality as to be frightening. To Converse With Dumb Beasts was also very real to anyone who has lived with a cat or a dog. But all of the stories are fresh and entertaining as well as original. The whole thing is wrapped up with an afterword about each story's origin and finally the book boasts a wonderful cover (no credit given)."
3,"This book was interesting, but dull","Like I said, this book didn't interest me too much. Some of the stories were good, but the others were a waste of time. I suggest going out and buying a different book."
3,Great book... once all the errors are corrected.,"While it provides a (in some sense) self-contained introduction to string theory, it is no secret that this was not the intended focus of this text (as indicated even by its title), so prior knowledge of string theory would be highly beneficial. It does however provide a novel viewpoint from which it introduces string theory, and it is so far the best/only text on D-Branes, which is a subject that has become vitally entangled with string theory, so it is worth reading for anyone in the field.Unfortunately, the deal-breaker is that there are many non-trivial errors throughout the text, which makes it difficult to be sure you understand what you think you are learning. A positive outlook comes from the fact that the author has an errata webpage where errors are being collected, so maybe there will be a future printing with most errors corrected that would deserve 4 or 5 stars."
1,Superficial,"Stick to Polchinski, and Green, Schwarz, Witten. Books written by authors that actually have a grasp of the subject."
3,"""BURIED"", BUT NOT FORGOTTEN!","Here's a great one that's been ""buried"" in time. It was originally made for television. However, it had all the suspense/ twist and turns in the style of Hitchcock tradition. Why this little gem of a horror flick hasn't been released onto dvd yet is truly a mystery. I came to Amazon, hoping to upgrade this film. (*I still have it on VHS*) However, it looks as though I'll have to wait a bit longer. Hopefully not too much longer. This really is overdue. Matheson was great in this, as was the rest of the cast."
4,How not to commit a subtle murder,"I do not fancy myself as a movie critic. I don't get paid by the number of useless words I write/spew; I won't use a lot of words and say nothing. The idea of killing someone with poison from a fish is not a bad idea. If this were to happen in a restaurant, a law suit would bring forth lots of money. However, doing it at home to your husband, you have to very careful and not be greedy about the money, don't spare the final expenses. Forty-five minutes into the movie, the climax, the best line in the movie is spoken, ""Honey, I'm home""."
3,"im just a little bit clastrophobic, really","this one pits Tim Matheson getting buried alive and then he rises again seeking his vengence. good movie with lots of good scenes. you gotta see it, and if your interested view the sequel with Ally Sheedy and Tim Matheson as well, but in that one Matheson dies(which was a bummer really)."
5,good movie but not really that scarey!,"this is a good movie but its not reallythat scarey. my friend has this movie, i saw it at her house like 3 or 4 times already. i really like it!but its not that scarey, at first it was but nowit's really not that scarey. if you want a movie thatcan give you chills or something then buy this movie!"
1,Low speed USB 1.1 hub,"The Amazon.com specifications for this device do not state its USB rating (transfer speed). This device is a USB 1.1 device which has a slower data transfer rate (12 Mbit/s) than the 2.1 (480 Mbit/s) or latest 3.0 super speed (5.0 Gbit/s) standard. This device is adequate for low transfer rate USB peripherals such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, tablets, etc., but you may find it too slow for other uses. Make certain that the device will match your needs."
5,Beautiful Cd,"Great record..I love every song, the different sounds make this cd so unique. Alvaro lopez its a great musician and producer I highly recommend this record, Just beautiful."
4,Greatest Female Trio Of All Time,"They paved the way for all the others that have since followed.....Diana and The Supremes were elegance, style, class and commerciality....This dvd from Holland, shows them a year before they were to break up as a group.....Having never seen a full supremes concert on dvd, nor any being officially available here in the u.s.a...this makes on hell of a gem to have. I wished though ,that is was in color as most of the visual appeal is lost through the black and white filming.....but considering it's age (shot in 1968 and looks very good in quality) and again it's rarity on dvd, this is an excellent collection to have....."
3,SUPREMES,"THIS PROGRAM WAS RECORDED IN 1968 AFTER FLO LEFT THE GROUP SO WHY WOULD THEY PLACE AN EARLIER PHOTOGRAPH ON THE COVER./the show is in black and white but still very dramatic and much better than the reflections Dvd.it would have been great if there had been footage from backstage, maybe there is somewhere. this is a must have dvd."
3,"""should have been digatally enhanced""","well being a supremes/diana ross fan every since ""baby love"" was released, i've certainly seen a lot of performance footage over the years,however with the modern technology that we have now i feel that this performance should have been digitally enhanced as it seems almost too grainy,the girls themselves were good & i found it amusing that a lot of their performance arrangements almost mirrored their ""live@london's talk-of-the-town"" facility recorded around that same time-period. i was also a little disappointed that it was not colorirized however being the fan that i am i do enjoy watching from timt2time, the bonus footage from 1964 was too brief but most enjoyable as we get to see & hear that powerful voice of the late/great florence ballard"
5,Great tool for those who need to have conversations between generations,"As a pastor, I am always searching for resources that will stimulate conversations between generations, particularly in dealing with end of life issues. Taylor's book is an excellent tool for adult children to begin needed talks with aging parents. Plus it works in the opposite direction--a tool for aging parents to express their own concerns as they face the many unknowns of their future."
4,A Big Help,"My siblings and I are just starting the process of helping our mother find a home where she is comfortable, and we are certain she is getting the help she is increasingly needing. This book had many suggestions that are not pertinent to our situation at the present time, but may be in the future, plus it gave us many ideas of what to look for, what to ask, where to get needed info and ideas, etc. After reading it myself I'd planned on passing it on to my siblings for them to read, but ended up ordering extra copies for them, since I want to hang onto my own for my personal use in planning my own future."
5,Best Self-Help Book Out There,"This book goes beyond other books out there. It is easy to read and understand. There are tons of examples so one does not feel like a failure if they can't think of an example themselves. It is a book for everyone. No matter whether you are a CEO, a stay at home mom, a teenager, etc. this book can help you have a better quality life. Highly recommended for all."
3,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 22","*** 1960. THE DEVIL'S EYE, based on a play written by Oluf Bang, was written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The Devil is affected with a sty in the eye because an 18 years old girl doesn't want to have sex before her wedding. Don Juan is sent to earth in order to seduce the young girl. This comedy is a minor effort of the Swedish master but could please the completist who sleeps in you. After the Death inThe Seventh Seal - Criterion Collection, the Devil is the second religious figure appearing in a Bergman movie.You can find zone 2 DVD's of THE DEVIL'S EYE at Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.fr."
3,Nice comedy,"It's comical and serious at the same time. Especially the scenes in hell. The whole thing is a satire, at times a stinging satire. Feminists must hate stuff like the instructions how to handle Scandinavian women, Bibi Andersson's creating her family nest and her relationship with her fiancé, Pablo and the parson's wife. Not the best of Bergman but good in its own right."
3,So--So,"For few dollars more, you get more from the Avia guide to Home Theater but this tool include 6.1 channel calibration."
2,Dated material.,"This DVD home theater tune up was too old. This was before blu ray players and hdmi inputs, and Lcd tv's. It does have a sound test to check your speakers, and that is the primary reason I bought it. The ""actors"" tried to be funny and put on skits. That made it worse. If you are looking for a how to video just check out youtube and search home theater setup. If you are only looking for a 5.1 speaker channel test, then this will work for you."
2,Out-of-date and disappointing,"Guys, this is basically the same as the Avia Guide, but supposedly with more of a beginner's tilt. Otherwise it's the same material. I have the Avia disc and I'm very disappointed by its out-of-dateness and very poor navigation, plus most of the video tests are useless, and the tests don't tell you how to fix things. I do not recommend either the Avia Guide or its cousin Sound & Vision Tune-Up guide."
2,Meh,Comes with blue filter glasses and a few better than average video patterns. But not much better than any DVD with THX Optimizer. My receiver has its own test tones so those were fairly useless to me.
4,Easy to use,"I basically was looking for something just to adjust the picture of my plasma television. This was relatively easy to do using this product. Instructions are easy to follow, and I was able to calibrate my picture in just a few minutes."
5,Sound and Vision Home Theater Tune-up,"A must have for any HDTV set up. Most TVs are sent by the manufacturers with the color settings and brightness way oversaturated. They want them to look bright if set up in stores for display.For even an amatuer, this simple DVD will lead you through the steps to adjust all of the settings to get accurate color from your set. No more ""blooming"" reds or unnatural skintones."
3,Disappointing end to a great series,"Given the quality of the other two books in the series I suppose it was difficult for Peter Hamilton to complete the story in a manner satisfactory to all his readers, however, despite my low expectations (all my friends had already told me that the ending was poor), I was still disappointed.If you've read the other two books, you probably have no alternative but to continue, however I guarantee that you will hate the conclusion to the trilogy."
2,War and Peace x 2,"Wow, what happened to Peter Hamilton? The first book in the series was great, the second was o.K., but this book is a bloody mess! I don't even know what I've read half the time, I was so confused. The author's switching of p.o.v. every other page made me completely space sick. I lost track of much of the action because of this hyper active story line. He should have stuck with 3 or 4 main characters, instead of a cast of thousands. ""War and Peace"" this is not. Plus, I can think of alot more scarrier villians than Al Capone. ""ForgetAboutIt."""
1,Very disappointing ending,"If you are planning to buy the series do not. The ending is terrible, unimaginative and spoils all 3 books. The author judging from his creativity in the books could have done much better offering a much more satisfying ending. I would rather have the story end with total devastation than salvation by a ""god"" like entity. Most disappointing was the way the author ended all the other plots. A quick, sloppy and more suitable to children's books approach that leaves a mature reader wondering which is the audience the author was targeting."
2,A mediocre story lost in long-winded tedium,"Two Stars - Two complaints:1) The book (and its successor) could do with some SERIOUS editing; they are way too long. I'm surprised that SO many words can say SO little.2) The sub-title should be Part 5 - that is what it felt like from start to middle. (It doesn't have an end - the words just sort of stop.) The book cannot stand on its own.Hopeful for closure to those dangling sub-plots (inventive and nicely interwoven), I pressed on through ""FAITH"" to be rewarded with a hasty Sunday-school, comic-book wrap-up. I guess Hamilton got as tired of typing the fluff as I did of skimming it.OK, maybe that is three complaints. I wish I'd got my hands on the ""Condensed"" version."
4,A briliant grand scope veiw of the far future.,"This grande finale to Hamilton's immense epic of the twenty seventh century is absalutely mezmerizing through nearly all of the one thousand pages. This is definitely one of the best sf series this decade. However...I was just a little dissapointed by the ending. It was a good finish and I liked the way the whole omega problem was solved, but it seemed just a little too easy for the main characters. Still, if Hamilton wants to do it that way it's his epic. The only real problem I had with the book was that somebody neglected to edit it when it was finished. The first two books in the trilogy were fine, but The Naked God had at least one glaring misprint on every page.If someone gets around to editing the semantic errors I'll hapillty give it all five stars!"
5,Space opera at its best,"Building upon the characters and concepts introduced in The Reality Dysfunction, this book is exciting and an enjoyable read. Though the very first novel in the series dragged a little, by the time you are a few pages into this you will be hooked! Suspension of disbelief has never been easier or more fun. Highly recommended."
4,Fulfilling Finale!,"Anyone who has read the complete 'Nights Dawn' series by Hamilton will only be able to say 'Wow!' The scope of the series, in terms of number of characters and storylines, can only be described as awe inspiring. That Hamilton manages to contain all these threads in a coherent overall story is astonishing. 'The Naked God' is everything the final act of a series should be: it pushes the speed and tension up a notch, introduces even more characters and races towards the ending at breakneck speed. Some reviewers have complained about the sci-fi staple ending, that is the deus ex machina. But I feel there is no surprise here. The title of this volume gives it away from the start and right from the very first volume the reader knows there is something out 'there' that can help mankind solve the possession problem.'The Naked God' is science fiction on a grand scale and should not be missed."
5,"""the Naked God""","Peter F. Hamilton's ""The Naked God"" Is a wonderfully complex tapestry of plots and characters. This is the best of the 6 books. It deals well with both intricate philosophy and Hard Sci-Fi. The only drawback to this book are the HUNDREDS (I'm not kidding) of Typos that are present. It makes it difficult to read at times, drawing the reader back into reality. Mr. Hamilton Please get a new editor!"
3,"Good, but you can wait for the paperback.","Unfortunately the author does not live up to the promise displayed in the first two volumes. Many of the questions and issues raised in the first two volumes are trivialised and reduced to techno babble in the finale. Also the many complex plot threads seemed get way out of hand so there is the classic ""deux ex machina"" to weave them into to the happily ever after ending. But the characterizations and plot detailing is done as well as in the previous two installments and a high level of drama and tension are maintained throught the book. So its worth going through to have the satisfaction of finishing the trilogy, but you can wait for the paperback to do that."
3,"""The Naked God"", or is that ""Dog""?","""The Naked God"" is the fifth and concluding chapter in the Reality Dysfunction series. Unfortunately, the author seems to have run out of enthusiasm for the project somewhere after the fourth volume. The current book does wrap up the plot lines and character outcomes, but at a price.This book is riddled with misspellings (but my spell checker said it was correct...), wrong word usages, and redundant phraseology. What stretches out to approximately 1,000 pages could have been much better handled in a more svelte 500 page format.If, like me, you hate to leave a series hanging without following it through to conclusion, then you have to buy the book. But be warned, mass quantities of caffeine will be required to wade through this overblown tome."
3,A step down from earlier volumes,"I was so eager for this book that at one point I considered ordering from the Amazon's UK site. Once I had the book, it took me a while to finish reading it. With the exception of a few exciting episodes, the plot moved nowhere for most of the book. Many characters introduced in earlier books had virtually no roles in the last book. That may be a good thing because many remaining characters did a lot, but contributed nothing in moving the plot forward. The Mortonridge incident turned into a quagmire literally and figuratively. The aliens, arguably the most fascinating aspect of the earlier books, again enlivened the story every time they appeared. Unfortunately, they only showed up for about 60 pages out of the hefty 900+ pages. Hamilton is really good when it comes to describing futuristic and space battles (the battle for Tanjuntic-RI is a primary example,) but for some reasons, he decided to waste so much of this book on whiny possessors."
4,Excellent. A satisfying end of the trilogy.,"In brief, i really enjoyed this book. I had finished the 2nd part last December and was really looking forward to the final installment. I just hoped that Hamilton would be able to keep the pace high. I was disappointed with the ending. The rest of the book, however, is very good. The way the different plot lines develop is very interesting, and the new developments keep you on the edge of your seat.I'm looking forward to any new material from mr. Hamilton."
5,well crafted thoughtful writing,"I have read this entire series. I have deeply enjoyed each installment. It is apparent, from the writing, that the author is weaving a multitude of social, moral, and technological issues into a wonderfully imaginative and thought provoking series. Each book is satisfying and the finale does not disappoint. I am eagerly awaiting more of Mr. Banks works!"
2,Bad slog,"I have to agree with the majority- it was a poor dwindling effort compared to the excitement built up so well over the first 3 books (the 4th started to get tedious). I could not care less for some of the characters ie Valisk, and found myself skipping over a lot of purely mundane description and tedious development. The only memorable thing was the xenoc development including Kiint, Tyrathca, etc. Like some other reviewers said, the ending/solution is just like a huge broom sweeping dust under a carpet- it lacked imagination and elegance. A pity."
4,The end of the rollercoaster,"This is a splendid book. Well, it had to be. Anyone who ploughed through the first two volumes of this trilogy are by now so keen on Hamilton's writings that the third volume could not fail to please. If you are reading this review and have not yet embarked on volume one then I urge you to do so. This is excellent work and beats other writers of space opera - Donaldson springs to mind - hands down. Tops the Culture in my opinion too.The only real downside is that inevitably in the last volume the loose ends are tied up, happy and sad endings are accomplished and there is a general feeling that the best and most exciting reading has gone before. This is the end of the rollercoaster and the highest pinnacle has already been climbed. But then again, what else can a writer do?"
3,Great series ... wish the author had known how to end it,"Hamilton's epic is destined to be recorded as one of SciFi's legendary achievements -- it will no doubt be mentioned with Asimov's Foundation series or Herbert's Dune books. Anyone who has read the first 2,000 pages of Hamilton's series must, of course, read The Naked God. Those of us who have made it this far have no choice. Unfortunately, Hamilton created such an impressive epic that he had no idea how to end it. Three thousand pages ... followed by a ten-page deus ex machina conclusion? Perhaps Josh Calvert could simply have woken up and realized it was all a dream."
1,Why do we waste our time on such?!,"This movie was NOT a good movie. Don't even bother wasting your time on it. Why are such movies made? I don't know. It was a big waste of time, money and film and I'm glad that the theater price wasn't paid. It just isn't a good movie worthy of watching. We also need cleaner movies, and this one doesn't qualify. It is just not worthy of time or energy."
2,Bulgaria,"Strictly speaking, 100% crap.The only virtue of this movie wasthat part of it was shot on Vitoshamountian just south of Sofia.Some shots are in front of thePKSS (Mountain Control and RescueService) headquarters, right behindHizha Aleko. You can clearly seethe Bulgarian Red Cross and PKSS logo."
4,Dueling Hearts,Dueling Hearts by Kat Martin was everything I expected from this author. I enjoyed reading about all the characters in the book. It kept my interest throughout reading the book. It is definitely a page turner.
3,Warning!,"It's a great book, as all of her books have been. However, you need to be aware there is a binding error. No fault of the seller. But you might want to ask them to check the book. When you reach page 152, there is a repeat of pages 129 - 152 and the same number of pages are missing. If you can bridge the gap, it's still a good book."
5,Dueling Hearts,All book by Kat Martin are very very good. I love to read them. I try to read them all
2,A FINE DROWNING BORE,"After facing smoke and fire in the Towering Inferno, Newman's next film seemingly have him facing water. But that's what deceptive about this film, the title, The Drowning Pool, really have nothing to do with anybody being drowned in a pool. It is a lame and tired blackmail plot and Newman is trying to found who is doing the blackmailer and why. Like all two fisted detective tales, our hero was bound to run into some mysterious and eccentric characters (as well as run around half naked on the beach to show how virile he still is). Well, he did, in a way....a boatload of bores. The only interesting bit here is a very young Melanie Griffith (in her natural brunette locks) playing an oversexed Lolita.The end, which I will not spoil for you, is quite ridiculous. Something about filling a room with water.I am sure the book, which this movie is based, was much better. Why else would they even consider making the book into a film?"
1,A lot of obvious bla bla,"Very American. Is there a world beyond their borders?Doesn't mention Data Centers, doesn't talk about market trends such ASPs.What about market data?Is the American market really so simple? (Smile, be nice to customers and then sell to a bigger company)"
3,lack of total review during these time periods,"I have not read the whole book as of yet. What I read for the time period during 1967 was very lacking on some major items. I feel that the author is only using military info based upon large scale ""named"" USMC Operations and not very important info concerning activities that had the same impact without having a ""name"". A good example was what happened to Fox Co. 2/5 on July 4, 1967 when they were overrun at Nong Son, or as we referred to that place as the ""Coal Mines"". A young machine gunner that came as a replacement to Fox Co. due to the high KIA rate that happened to them on Operation II on June 2, 1967. This man won the Congressional Medal of Honor and was in country for less than a month. This only one of several examples that I can attest to. Thank you."
2,Flat and disappointing,"There are moments that show the Marines' great heroism, sacrifice and humanity, but these are sparsely detailed and left me wanting more texture, more of a feeling of what these guys went through. Many of the terms are not defined which doesn't help a civilian like myself. The maps are too few and have so little detail, it is hard to get a sense of the sweep of events over the terrain. This book reads like a compilation of various lists of engagements, dates, places, commanding officers. I found it flat and disappointing."
1,total waste of money,"the Title has nothing to do with the useless pap contained in the publicationdo not waste your money, even ""used"" for a $1thank god I am only out a $1, plus shipping"
3,Rockport Sandal review,"The sandal is very comfortable and well made, however probably due to it's size it looks a little too bulky, and too much leather on it, plus it does not keep it's shape once you take it off. Actually I was looking for another style but it was not available, possibly because it was towards the end of summer."
5,Get a copy,I finally bought this book after reading through someone's at work. It's a nice short read but long enough that it still makes an impact. It's been a long time since I actually found myself enjoying poetry.
5,Great poetry from a talented writer,"There are probably a few people in life that haven't been tested like others have. But I always like hearing about people that go through tremendous things in their life and then find their way out through faith. I can relate to this poetry in so many different ways. It has a spiritual side that I find uplifting, and the words reach down into my soul and really move me. It's very well written and makes you FEEL exactly what she's talking about when reading each poem.In addition, I've spent some time dealing with things like abuse and alcoholism in my family as well, and I think anyone that has can relate to some other poems in the book.And for any woman that has juggled career and independance and wondered if she'd ever find love, happiness, peace... I think you'd enjoy this book too."
3,The poetry equivalent of a self-help book,"Let me start by saying that I don't generally read poetry, and when I do I tend to go for the `classics'. I got this book due to the excellent reviews it was getting and was not aware I was getting a book of poetry at the time.The book is all about confidence, awareness, self-worth, and forgiveness. I may well have appreciated it more if I was going through a more stressed or depressed time of my life, but as it was, I thought it was a bit elementary and repetitive.I think this book will make the perfect present for a teenage daughter or niece, or a female friend going through a rough patch. Certainly, every woman will find at least one poem she'll be able to relate to.However, when I next need a book to inspire me or make me feel better, I'll go back to my all-time favourites: `Jonathan Livingston Seagull' or `The Alchemist'"
5,A Skylark he was!,"If you've lived a while and remember the music of the '30s through the '60s, hum a tune and the chances are it will be one of Mercer's -- either lyrics or lyrics and music. The man was a phenomenon! Furia gives an even-handed account of Mercer's life, including the good, the bad, and the ugly. When he was sober, he was a prince, a genius. When he was in his cups, he was someone else. Furia gives us Mercer's Savana upbringing as a ""southern boy,"" and that was always part of his persona. This is a book you will want to read and to skim as an encyclopedic account of his myriad works. ""Skylark"" is the perfect title."
4,Skylark,"This book was a good read, very informative, but contains a bit too much psychoanalysis. And I found the misspelling of Al Capp's name to be quite offputting."
5,The Hommage Album. Nana Mouskouri.,"This inspiring ""Hommage"" album, contains some of the Greatest music ever performed/written by an artist. It's quite a tough thing to play around with material written by legends like Brel, Dalla, Brassens... Nana does it with such ease... she really pours her love into every song. What you get here is a genuine, rare timeless album...Bravo Nana...Strictly Recommended."
2,Merely okay,"Don't believe the manufacturer's claim that this is ""one of the greatest films ever made."" I don't think it's even one of the greatest Japanese films. While the story is a ""moral"" one, the cinematography mesmerizing, and editing pretty good, the overall film feels slow yet empty. It's very easy to follow, but you never get to feel for the heroine. Speaking of which, the actress is way too old for her role -- the character's supposed to be ""between 16 and 18"" at the beginning of the story!This movie is not a tragedy; it's a tribute to human dignity and the will to survive. Unfortunately it has a pretentious feel to it that, coupled with the rather harsh acting style, makes it a rather unsatisfying movie experience."
3,tragedy.,"Kenji mizuguchi is a famous japanese movie director along with Yasujiro Ozu. He is known for a feminist and he derected movies such as ""Ugetsu Monogatari""-story of Ugetsu-. ""The Life of Oharu"" is the story that basically the life of the woman called Oharu; the story is based on the book by Chikamatsu Monzaemon. This is a tragedy that Oharu who was born in a good family and went down the social classes.One thing I have to note is the way Oharu moves. It is very graceful and it is as if we are watching traditional Japanese dance. Also, her first lover is acted by Toshiro Mifune, he is in many Kurosawa movies.I didnt like this movie because Oharu is so passive and her life is so much controlled by men. But, this doesnt mean I discourage people to watch this movie. Everybody has a different taste and I hope you enjoy this movie."
5,Good Resource,Has even more information than this player needs! Good value. The Star Spangled Banner is great. Like the detail covering tone.
4,Good book and tab work but only ok CD,A little disappointed in the CDThe book is great but the CD only covers a few measures of each song??? Whats the point of having the CD if it doesn't cover the entire song Chad? The other book I got by Andy Aledort the CD covers the entire song. Both books are for Hal leonard...Dont get it. Would have been 5 stars if the CD was better
3,"This is a ""pamphlet"" and not a book.","I ordered this ""book"" expecting a real book with lots of pages. Though a minor miracle occurred in our lives, I felt this was mis-advertised as a book. It was in fact twelve 7 inch by seven inch pages with typing on both sides and folded in half for a total of 24 pages...in other words, a pamphlet. I do not wish to disparage the author or demean the quite relevant information presented, rather the fact that this pamphlet was shipped for $3.65 when it could have been shipped in a standard #10 envelope with a $0.32 cent stamp. In all fairness, the ""book"" was good, readable, and presented well. Amazon.com was more than helpful in refunding my account for the inordinate postage costs. Bottom line....good material, just be careful when ordering if the cost of shipping exceeds the cost of the item ordered."
3,"GREAT, but not that great!","Every BSB fan knows that they are the bomb and honestly im beginning to think the same. Although i have to say im 100% faithful to my boys from *N Sync. But really i enjoyed this track! I wanted to be in the concert itself. I loved it, and you will too, duh!"

1,Doesn't work for South Africa,"The packaging (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo237HT22L4DIQL/B0009EXVFI/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link) says that it works for South Africa, but it lies. The adapters will accept a South African plug and convert it to other outlets, but won't adapt any plug to a ZA outlet.Pros: compacttight fit for polarized US plug into all three adaptersworks for most countriescons: doesn't work for the one specific country I need an adapter formisleading packagingI'll be exchanging this product for http://www.amazon.com/Ceptics-Grounded-Universal-Adapter-Africa/dp/B007YLFNL4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=IQ6E1EFK7LFD&coliid;=IGBR1VEMHJBNB"
4,Worked well in all 5 countries on a Euro trip,"This travel adapter worked perfectly on a recent vacation to 5 different countries in Europe. As long as you don't need to convert the voltage this should work fine for charging your electronics while traveling.The one frustrating part was figuring out how they all snap into each other, particularly when not using them and just trying to keep all 3 together when traveling between places. This is by no means a dealbreaker, but was a bit annoying.The price online is right - you'll save about $30 from buying the same exact thing at the Shack of Radios."
4,Very Handy,"Before visiting family in Europe earlier this year I could not find my old plug adaptors, which were the same type as these. I bought a new set, and was once again happily utilizing my US electronics all over the continent. I prefer this type of adaptor over the all-in-one type because these usually have a more secure fit. I was not disappointed."
4,excellent,"Used throughout Italy two times, Turkey once and on a European Cruise. Going to order another one for my daughter who will be studying abroad in Florence. Love how they all fit into eachother for easy traveling"
3,"Expensive for just a plug adapter, but it works.","That's really all that matters. It works, and it's easy to fit in a bag. Just remember this is only a plug adapter, not a voltage adapter. About the only real negative is that if you have to mix plugs (i.e., if you have a British device that needs to go in a European continental socket) you have to chain pieces of this together, and that's not very stable.T"
1,Does not work!,I bought this product for a trip to Asia and it did not work in China even though the packaging clearly called out China as one of many countries it can be used in. The description and labeling are extremely misleading. I will never buy another Sima product again.
4,Worked well for us,Used the Sima sip 3 in London for 10 days and it worked. A little tricky at first with the power cord prongs going into the adapter sockets but used my lenovo r61 laptop with it as well as a recharger for our digital camera batteries and it worked as advertised.
5,Their gonna make some noise!,"This album kicks A$$, give it a shot you won't be disappointed. If you get a chance to see them live, do it, just saw their show at the Bottom Lounge in Chicago and they played an awesome set"
3,It Was Just OK....,I have enjoyed visiting Dunhill stores and using their products for over 30+ years. I thought the book could have been better. It is more of a modern luxury brand marketing book. I missed seeing more vintage Dunhill items. They also never really capture some of the great former Dunhill locations and their men's club like settings.
3,Use it along with another book,"We just returned from 10 days in Tuscany. I bought this book and also Rick Steeves Italy book. While the Florence Tuscany book has more specific information I found myself looking to other guides for more. The maps are hard to read because they are hand drawn and not very detailed. We were there to explore the wine regions and there just wasn't much information about it. Surprising since that is what the majority of the area is. Also, don't let Steves scare you away from Pisa. We didn't find traffic and parking to be a problem at all. I'm glad we didn't follow his advice. The one recommendation that turned out to be the highlight of our trip was Lucca. His suggestion to rent bikes and bike the ramparts was great! For everything else, fortunatley, our villa we had a Frommer's Italy 2003 guide. It turned out to be a much better resource for what we were looking for."
3,"An ""ok"" book, but not essential","Although I thought this book was ""ok"" I couldn't help but feel that this book was written more to increase the number of books Rick is selling, rather than to fill a need for this type of book.I was also surprized to find Rick, early in the book, slamming the Eyewitness Guidebooks. His books we are told, are all one requires, and that you should ""borrow"" an Eyewitness book from those you might bump into on vacation, if you want.On the good side, however, there was museum information in this book that was very useful."
2,Death -dealing,"This sometimes briliant sometimes funny, sometimes fascinating novel. Is also sometimes boring and too complicated, too long and too rambling. You find yourself thinking you are in a Kafka novel trying to get out. I am afraid this book was a mortal blow to my desire to read any more of Mr. Rushes work."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I enjoyed Mating so much, especially the first half. As for Mortals, all I can say is that somewhere, in a safe deposit box, Norman Rush has some very damaging photos of his editor."
2,"Great music, sloppy production","If you're already a Bonfire fan, this CD probably isn't for you. I'll leave it to others to review the actual music and just mention a couple things about the production. There are some major blunders.""American Nights"" fades out, then the last split second is loud again. The next song on the CD is ""Fantasy,"" but ""American Nights"" bleeds over into the song. The end of ""Ready 4 Reaction"" also bleeds over into the beginning of ""Never Mind,"" but not as severly.""Sweet Obsession"" ends abruptly, and doesn't have the cool echo effect. (The song should end with the phrase ""Set my heart free,"" and the word ""Free"" should echo a few times.)""Rock Me Now"" has had the first 48 seconds removed.This is great music that deserves better production. You may save a few dollars by buying the double CD, but, ""You get what you pay for."""
1,"If you want to own a brand new broken tv, this is your pick!","After a mere 34 days of ownership, our brand new RCA took a [stopped functioning]. Although the picture and quality in general was excellent, we never did get a chance to try the VPORT cable with the XBOX, as the cable is next to impossible to find anywhere but online. Sitting around the tv one tuesday night, watching a particularly great movie, and the screen flickers momentarily and goes white. Several attempts to fix the problem were to no avail. A quick call to our place of purchase and the tv will be promptly returned tomorrow, leaving nothing but a blank space on my wall and a bad taste in my mouth. So, to all who think this tv is next on their list of must-buys.... please, think again."
3,"Good under hood light, but poor hangers... shop elsewhere.","I ordered this very item from ToolTopia.com a month ago. Their price was not the lowest (SJDiscount Tools has it for $156.92) but their warehouse was closer to my location and shipping was free.The under hood light was for my husband, and it works very well. But the hangers that attach the light to the frame do not appear to be the same as in the photo, and are woefully inadequate. The hangers we received with it are extremely flimsy S-hooks and at any time the bulb falls out during hanging.I contacted ToolTopia, and requested they locate the hangers shown in the photo, which appear much more secure. After some hemming and hawing, they didn't contact the manufacturer Central Lighting, but emailed me their phone number suggesting I remedy the problem myself. ToolTopia would not support the product they sold me and was uninterested in locating the missing parts. I do not recommend them!"
3,Needs separate brake spring retaining tools not one universal w/ both sizes.,Kit is well made. Nice plastic case. Spring removal tools work fine and are well made. However I did not lioke the universal brake shoee retaining tool as the tool on the other side dug into my hand installing brake shoe retaining springs. Alot of pressure must be used on new spring to compress them enough for pin to catch and hold. I ordered a KD tool 285 11/16 to 7/8 to use on my Dodge Dakota R/T next time. The 285 has a handle you can push on and put some force behind instead of the smaller tool size on the other end to push into your hand. For the $$$ you should of got two separate brake shoe retaining tools as it isn't a cheap set!
5,Service kit,This is a very handy tool kit to have-works great and it is something that we will definitely use again in the future-it saves time and stress!!!
5,A man from a different time!,"Charlie Askins did what most men would only dream of. However, some of those actions would land him in the state pen nowdays.A good read for anyone in the gun culture. This book shows the good side and psycopathic side of the author.My copy is autographed!"
5,great,These kind of books are hard to find but having been a recognized National Shooter for almost 25 years I read all I can about these guys. Thanks for your inquiry. Mike Bandelier
3,Frustrating...,"""A Wild Yearning"" had a lot going for it, but there were just too many things that I didnt like about it. First of all, let me just say that I admire Penelope Willamson and have read quite a bit of her work. The heroine of ""A Wild Yearning"", Delia, was fantastic. She was completely outspoken and didnt hold in her feelings at all. I adored her. That being said, I couldnt warm to Ty. He was so arrogant. It drove me crazy the way he was so inconsisent with Delia. He was immature and selfish and he drove me insane. However,Ty's behavior I could have handled... To me, the biggest drawback of this book was its length. I dont have problem with a nice meaty read, but this book just wore out its welcome plain and simple. Too many obstacles were thrown in and it slowed the books pace and frustrated me to no end. All in all, this story was by no means bad, but it is not one that I will read again."
5,A Very Sexy Story,"I love this woman's books, she writes with such depth and passion! Anyone not turned on by the love scenes alone must be made of stone! The characters of Delia & Ty will have you turning the pages and then trying to slow down so you don't finish it so fast. Highly entertaining and a must-have for Penelope Williamson fans."
5,A FUN WAY TO MAKE A POINT!,"Clarice Bean, the irrepressible little charmer created by Lauren Child, is seeing green. Green as in ecology, that is.School is getting interesting for Clarice as she's learning about our planet Earth. Gravity is an amazing force to her, as is the fact that the sea doesn't spill over at its edges. Nonetheless, her class is assigned a project called The Environment. She's pleased because to her that is simply nature, and she knows a lot about that as there is plenty of it in her backyard.Being paired with Robert Granger, the pest who lives next door, is enough but when Clarice learns a tree on her street is about to be cut down, well, things get really rugged. Brother Kurt decides to try to save the tree by camping in it, and others sport ""Free the tree"" signs.Just imagine what Clarice comes up with in order to save the tree. Once again, Lauren Child comes up with a fun way to make an important point...."
5,Well Done,Beautiful. A clear and concise readable guidline. There were a lot of wonderful pictures and all the information was very clear and understandable. A very valuable source for anyone who is thinking of buying an Oriental Rug.
5,Oriental carpet book,This book had beautiful colored pictures of many carpets. A very helpful book at a good price.
1,Made in China,"This does nog match the original plates and bowls we had from the same manufacturer. This stuff is made in china (vs. England where it used to be made). Sizes are slightly smaller for plate and bowl diameter. The pattern on the lips differs. Thus they don't stack well with the old ones and the new ones stand out since the lips/edges don't match.I would have sent them back, but my wife had unpacked and washed them before I found out. Not the end of the world, but if I had it to do over I would not buy these."
4,Inconsistent shades,"The dinner plate is over 11"" in diameter. Salad plate is 8""; bowl is 6""; and the tea saucer is almost 5"".The 5-piece arrived on time, looking almost like pictured on Amazon. The colors have inconsistent shades. My dinner and teacup with saucer look exactly like Amazon's picture, but the salad and the bowl have a noticeably lighter shade of blue.This set is earthenware, not bone china. They are made in China and are dishwasher and microwave safe. Johnson Brothers' Blue Willow quality is nowhere near Churchill's quality, but they do have a wider variety of pieces, for example, oval platter, vegetable bowl, creamer, teapot, etc., which you can also buy from Amazon.I only wanted a 5-piece, and Churchill does not come in 5-piece set. So, I didn't have a choice there, but I'm also very happy with Johnson Brothers."
5,Providence,This was a wonderful book. I highly recommend it. The description of the characters and the struggles they endured made me cheer for them all!!
5,Providence,"Great book, held my interest all the way through it, well written.I could feel that I was there reliving the story."
4,Heartwarming story.,"Although I normally don't enjoy stories set in the old West, this was an exception. Kate's determination to keep her ranch after her husband's death, and Luke's struggle with his relationship with God kept me reading.The only thing that keeps me from giving this book 5 stars is the editing. There were several glaring mistakes in grammar, and then suddenly the letter B and the symbol > kept appearing in the middle of sentences. I found this distracting.All in all, I would recommend this heartwarming book."
3,Good enough,"The story line was mostly good, and it was written in a way that was easy to follow along. I don't know if it is just my bad luck or if everyone sees a bunch of B's in the middle of text. Like instead of a space, there is a capital letter B throughout the book. I learned to ignore the B's but it was confusing for a while.I enjoyed how the author portrayed how Christian life in this timeframe might have been, and without it being ""preachy""I disliked the evil rancher aspect. I understand it's a book and you need events to take place, but it just seemed like an obvious page filler. He's never brought to justice, and we never found out why he HAD to have all the land. I also wondered why he was in church singing along with all the people he was trying to destroy.Overall, it was a decent read. Not horrible, not great, just good enough."
2,Poor ending,While I enjoyed most of the book the ending was abrupt and left a lot unfinished. The biggest drama of the book happened and then was never resolved. Disappointing.
4,Enjoy,"Enjoyed this book, and would like more books in this category. Keep up the good choices of books. I enjoy"
2,2 and 1/2 st,I did not think the story was complete Like what happened to the men who shot Kate? How did Kate meet Luke's father?
3,Just ok,"This book would be good for a young reader. It is a quick, easy read but lacks any real excitement."
5,Intriguing Inspiritional Story,"The author's wisdom, common sense and attention to detail shines through in this book. I learned many things about life on a ranch in this creative and very believable story. Though there is light romance, the emphasis is on inspiration through life's trials. It is a good 'clean' read with an interesting plot as its foundation with twists and turns. Not that you're left hanging, I hope the story doesn't end here."
3,I may have missed something,"I truly enjoyed this read, mostly. I was disappointed with the evil rancher and his sadistic sidekick. That part never really went anywhere and seems almost innocuous. Then at the end, what happened to them? Were they hunted down and strung up? There is no mention after the shooting of anything happening with them? Did they just get away with it? I was so disconcerted when I finished this story, to have such an unfinished ending."
5,Providence,This is a great story from a period of time I love to read about. It shows how a woman's trust in God and a cowboy's future pays off in the long run despite some personal hang ups they both have to work through. I really enjoyed this book. It is definitely a great read.
4,A synthesis of a contribution not a synthetic model,"The book is a very good synthesis of Sternberg's work about intelligence, creativity and wisdom (a good option for someone who is not yet familiar with it) but it provides nothing but a combination of the previous contributions of the author. Its emphasis on the broadening of the concept of intelligence is not new in Sternberg's work. The main issue of the book is neither the relationships between the concepts, as I was expecting judging by the title, nor the new levels of analysis and explanation that could have emerged from those relationships. In the last chapter I felt really disappointed because it finished even before I thought it had started..."
3,"Useful history of the contested concept of ""intelligence""","I enjoyed Sternberg's history of the concept & how people have fought over what to measure and how to measure it. ""Intelligence"" turns out to be quite a loaded notion! I found Sternberg's distinction between analytic, creative,and practical intelligence very helpful. It helped me understand why people with a high measured analytic intelligence sometimes fall short of what we think they could achieve."
4,Very Good Product,"This product is cool and helpfull, cause you can save data, music, pictures, and you only need the USB cord so you can share it to your friends. The bad thing of this product is that you can't record from a line in or microphone, very bad. But i like the product. The battery is not that good when you use the main Walkman, use mor the controler."
4,Almost 3 stars....,"Honestly the product is great at playing music and connectively with the computer but the original reason I bought it was so that when I tagged my music with cover art I would see it on the screen...uh no, that's not what this does.You can only attach the cover art that you take with this camera...no downloading the images into the player.I love the mini really and it does a really good job but be warned if you're looking to tag your mp3s and see the details in the player."
1,Absolute Junk!,"I bought these for a wedding and had to buy new ones at the last minute. First of all, they were too short for my legs. And why is that? Not only were they too short, these things have absolutely no stretch and get runs VERY easily. I am NOT ordering nylons online anymore. I would prefer to see what kind of material they are actually made of before I buy! I got better nylons for half the price at another store!"
3,introduces the Pilbara,"The video gives a nice introduction to the Pilbara region. Showing its vastness and the beauty of the scenery. The shots of wildflowers in bloom are gorgeous. The video also takes us to the mining towns, which are now an essential part of the world economy. From these booming localities comes a lot of the iron ore that powers Chinese industrialisation.For a related take on the Pilbara, considerRed Dust in Her Veins. It gives an understanding of growing up in this harsh and lovely environment, with narratives from several local women. Unlike the video, the book has a deeper consideration of what it was like to live in the region, as contrasted to just passing through."
1,boring stupid all above,"This was waste of money, This documetary was made up I do believe the story is true seen it on other programs but in this dvd they only talk they don't show anything that would be interesting and it is boring, if you need something to put you to sleep watch this video"
3,"Too small, uncomfortable in use",I am an adult male and my hands are not huge but I found these hemostats very uncomfortable to use because my thumb was painfully tight in the handle. Otherwise they work as advertised.
2,Poor quality control,"These are very cheaply made, as one might expect from the price. Of the four I received, one was so tight as to be difficult to open and close and one was so loose as to not lock securely. This effectively doubles the price of the other two, and unless one orders $20 worth the shipping effectively doubles the price again - not a good value at all."
5,You'll Never Be The Same!!,This movie follows the true story of a boy that was just a few years older than my husband at the time of this nightmare in El Salvador. Thank God we live in America. You will understand WHY so many of them are in the U.S. today. Never forget: Everybody has a story.
3,Mexican spanish is different than Salvadoran,"The story is good, but this a a film about the Salvadorean people, the accent is that of Mexicans, not a single Salvadorean phrase was used. Other than that very important fact, the film is good."
3,Good documentary about war on children but it is EXTREMELY VIOLENT,"I would rate this movie an R rating. It is VERY VIOLENT. No children should see this movie, ADULTS ONLY.When I saw the description on the DVD case as a ""mother and son love movie"", I thought that I might want to see it, but it IS NOT.A much much better ""mother and son love movie"" would be the movie ""Under the same moon""."
1,Voces inocentes is a science ficiton movie.,"If you only want to watch an action or a war movie, I recomend yout to watch ""Rambo"". This movie is based on pure fiction with a sad story that sells. The actors are Mexican and speak Spanish ""Mexican Style"" they don't speak the Central American Spanish. The settings(the houses, the buildings) do not look like Soyapango not even a bit! And the story about the El Salvadorean Arm Forces recruiting 12 year old youngsters is just disgusting and a big lie.But if you like Science Fiction and Sad stories, you will like this one. Just keep in mind: don't believe everything in this story that was made up to make money."
5,Strong messages from a beautiful poetic story,"Very emotional and very poetic story, based on true events during the El Salvadorean civil war. Mild colors of love and care are beautifully contrasted to colors of cruelty of war and military regime. The fact that's based on real people and real events, gives the story and its messages an additional, very powerful dimension.I suggest to watch it more than once to catch the most beautiful from this movie. At the first watching I was completely overwhelmed by impressions of war atrocities, inhumanity, injustice and evil; at the next watching I was able to better perceive very emotional and affectionate relationships behind the dark heavy veil of war; later on I became more aware of very good acting, and found other fine details.I must repeat here what other reviewers said: this film all should see, because Innocent Voices speak so loudly!!!One of movies reaching the deepest of my heart, so it's absolutely one of my favorite-10 films."
2,More information needed,It would have been nice if this box set had a simple set list(and description) of songs in the book for easy reference so as not to have to go right through the book.
2,I haven't heard this cd,"But looking at it, it does not have my favorite song by Lennon. That song is ""Crippled Inside"". How great can it be?"
5,Lennon is a genius !,"What can I say more about this box ? What is not yet said about it ? Lennon was surely the most talentuous of the Beatles and this box proves it. His songs are for eternity and will ever last. Absolutely great !! If I could give more than 5 stars, i'd do it !"
4,The Dakota Beatle,"Excellent box set. Has almost everything I've been looking for.....until I get to the 4th CD. I have a bootleg called ""The Dakota Beatle Sessions"", with about 25 tracks that are just John on the piano or the guitar. Among the tracks on that CD that are missing from this box set are - ""sally and billy"", ""now and then"", ""india"", ""that's the way the world is"", ""mirror, mirror"", and ""dorothy"". All said, there's about 17 tracks on this CD that are fantastic, and not included on the box set. Buy the box set, then do anything you possibly can to get this bootleg, as they compliment each other."
1,Biased opinion ruins the fine story,"Good work, bad lies.. it sure can convince the average American reader, however not those who know a little about history. There is no reason for a victorious army to burn down a city which they had just liberated. Istanbul has more Greek influence than Smyrna, why didn't they burn it down as well? On the other hand, Greeks had many reasons to burn a city that they were preparing to leave for good, not to leave Turks anything of use behind. Just like they did to many smaller towns in Western Anatolia before they retreated."
4,I feel so sad when reading this book,"Once again , a book bringing back memories of the past. I feel very sad to hear from fellow Turks, that no massacre happened, and the Greeks just light up in fire the city. My grandfather, lost three brothers and a sister , to the so famous called routes, that the Turks forced them to walk , thousand of miles, in the winter, without not even a coat. I recall my grandfather telling me how he was separated from his brothers, which he never heard about them. This book brought memories back, memories of the genocide that Pontiacs faced, back in 1913-1920...from the so called democrat Ataturk. Read this book, that describes in detail, the historical facts, that so many historians have wrote. I also suggets Theas Hallo book ""Not even my Name"", which you can found in amazon."
5,Excellent Book for all History buffs,"Great book, that explains how the Turks torched the beautiful city of Smyrna in retaliation against the Greeks, Armenians and the other Christian minorities. It all took part from the Turkish leader Kemal Attaturk who is venerated in Turkey but is seen as a murderer in other nations. G The book begins by describing the Ottoman Empire, the Armenian Genocide and other Ottoman destructions.Great book!!! A must read."
2,disappointing!,"I'm currently doing research into different dog breeds, especially the beagle, as I hope for a new puppy companion in the next year. Compared to other similarly priced and marketed books, this has got to be the worst. VERY generic pet care information with little to no breed-specific information. There is supposedly a 'new' section in the back of the book called ""living with a beagle"" or something of that sort, which I turned to in the hopes it would flesh out more breed particularities. Ha! Not at all. Do yourself a favor and get something else- I was nicely surprised by the Dummies Guide to Beagles!"
5,Excellent DVD !,"Excellent DVD from our loved Greek singer. It is a ""souvenir"" of all his hits since the very beginning. Don't miss it if you are a real Demis' fan or if you appreciate the soft international music with an exceptional voice. On 2009 Demis Roussos will celebrate 40 years of career, so, this DVD is a treasure as a visual collection even in PAL system (the European one)."
1,Demis Roussos: Greatest Hits DVD,"I am so disappointed my heart is broken as I was so looking forward to this DVD. as when I was 11 -13 in Baghdad, Iraq he was so popular his voice was drilled in my brain in a good as all his songs are filled with love . . .love . . .love And I love to love. I returned it there was 300 song CD that I ordered that I didn't even open after my bad experience with the DVD, I wonder if I should have, as I missing a lot of old song with the another CD of him that I got."
2,Not one of her best,"I have read a couple of her books and while i realise that she has a thing for writting her books like poems, i think this was taking it a bit too far. Not only was the book truly disjointed the narrative was like something out of a bad shakespare story. The story is too unreal for the day and age we are in"
1,What Happened To This One!!!,"I'm a great fan of KS, but this book was awful! Not only was it hard to follow, Brooke and Rafe were totally boring. Only when Peter and Lilly got together did it become even remotely interesting, and that was more than halfway through the book. And their relationship consisted mostly of phone conversations!As passionate as Rafe was about horses and flowers, why didn't he ever get his own place with his own horses and flowers? In the real world, he would have been considered something of a gold digger, or moocher.KS tends to use the same names for her characters in her books. Why?If you're new to KS's work, don't start with this one! I only finished it in deference to this usually talented author."
3,Wasn't so impressed...,I don't think this album was one of her better ones. I was just disappointed by it...
5,wow!,"this is some of juliana's best work. it is a must have for all fans. she is open, honest, bothered, happy, in love all in one package. lots of caring and emotion! wow! get it!"
5,A voice of an Angel!,"I love her voice, & her lyrics are so honest!!!! What can I say it is a beautiful Allbum."
3,Not a review per se,"Like the title says, this is not a proper review in that I'm not going to say anything at all about the book - save that it has been useful for my research, and that it may be of some historical interest. Rather I would like to point out to anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this book that it has been digitized by the Internet Archive and is freely available in multiple formats (including PDF) at:http://www.archive.org/details/anatomyofsuicide00winsrichThis should be preferable to spending $100+ on a book that is no longer in print."
4,smells good,i love this product... it gives a sweet natural smell... and it stays on you all day long...
4,Great child's Movie,"This movie came out when my children were small and they loved it! The seal as a baby and grown up is adorable and the true story is wonderfully done.My youngest son is a daddy now and my grandson is 3 1/2. Andre was purchased for him. He loves it and has played it over and over again. His dad/mom and grandfather have enjoyed it MANY times since it arrived in Nov and I am so glad its available in DVD.If you or your kids like ""true life animal adventure"" movies, this one is not to be missed! Enjoy it again and again."
5,Great movie for kids as well as adults,"For all animal lovers, kids and adults alike, this is a wonderful true story that inspires me every time I watch it (yes, I've watched it many times!!). Kids love it too. It's a good way to get kids interested in animals. Highly recommended."
5,Great family movie!!!!,This movie is for all ages. My family has spent so many hours watching 'Andre' together.
3,The,"Toni Whitney (Tina Majorino) and her family rescue an injured baby seal and name him Andre (a sea lion plays the title character, as seals are too unreliable to train). You'd think the fine flippered friend would blend right in with the Whitney menagerie - they share their seaside home with everything from frogs to dogs - but he's a mischievous mammal who wins one enemy too many in the person of a drunken fisherman (played by Keith Szarabajka) who believes that Andre is the culprit that tore his net. Watch for original 16 mm films of the real Andre during the credits. Not a bad kid-flick.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Good parts but not for young kids,"If you are looking for wholesome family entertainment for young kids, you might be glad to know a few things about this movie. A fisherman repeatedly threatens to shoot Andre, he gets drunk, attacks Andre with a pitchfork, and gets into a fistfight with the dad. Later on there is a scary struggle with a shotgun. There is swearing. There are two scenes with dead seals. The dad is likable but has problems understanding his kids which adds stress to the movie.I'm not saying all these things are bad. You just might like to know as you decide.There are some funny scenes and the dad mostly is able to solve his family problems. However, based on feedback from my kids age 6 and 9, the negatives had more of an impact than the positives."
5,Excellent movie,The movie was much better than expected. I had watched it with my wife several times and still looking forward to see it again.
4,What A Personality,"This ""based on real life"" story brings together people and a special animal; Andre. He proves that seals are not necesssarily the enemy of fisherman."
4,Andre Great kids movie,My grandkids 11and 8 visiting for the 4th of july weekend thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
5,wonderful,"Great movie everyone should see. Is great for kids and the whole family,one you will never get tired of watching. One of my favorites."
1,Andre,I ordered two movies same day. Both movies have problems with them--one more so than the other. On movie I could only watch bits and pieces because of the freezing and jumping forward over parts of the movie. The other movie froze twice at the beginnning of then jumped forward but after that was okay. A good movie but I would have liked to seen all of the beginning. .
1,"andre-i thought it would be good, but no","andre more like bad. i mean come on that scene where the cow flew that was totally fake. and that one part where the dog made that dunk, come on, and when the guy shot ghandi that was totally unfairyes i realize these are parts from twister, air bud, and ghandibut when rolled into one you get this movie, Andre, i would rather jump off of the grand canyon than watch this one. my recomendation----NO WAY"
2,"I wish I could shut off the ""automatic"" part","I bought this filter because of all the glowing reviews I saw. I followed the directions which say to unplug it and plug it back in every so often to reset the sensors. I found this filter to work well in the first minute or so after turning it on, but then its ""automatic"" features would kick in and decide what the problem was in my air (""dust,"" ""odor,"" or ""allergens"") It always seemed to switch into ""odor"" mode, and it would stop filtering dust, even though there was still lots of dust in the air. I didn't notice any odor. I wish I could put it in manual mode and have it just filter dust, but there is no way to do that. So I'm returning it."
3,I needed it for more pure air and it works very well.,It works very well. I needed it for allergies. It helps a lot with allergens in the air. It is a good style an takes up not too much space.
5,Quiet and effective air purifier,The air purifier is effective in clearing the air - even of odors. It is quiet and easy to move to new locations. I am satisfied with my purchase and use it daily.
2,This was such a disappointment,I got this air purifier a year ago. I have a lung disease and wanted something that would really filter the air very well. It did seem to filter the air just fine and did not make much noise. It really lit up with a number of light sensors. It looked very impressive.My problem was that it was just extremely hard to clean. It has many pieces that must be put together exactly right in the right order. In putting it back together this time I broke one tiny little wire and the whole thing would not work. Perhaps it is just me. The maintenance was just too much for this senior citizen. It is an impressive looking machine but I just threw it out and ordered another one of the simple-to-change Holmes Air Purifiers.
4,Second unit works nicely,So the first unit indicated a problem with the UV/Ionizer. I shipped this back with a quick and easy exchange (Amazon is great with this) and received my replacement unit very quickly. I am pleased to say that this second unit is working perfectly!
4,Still have allergies but great for smells in house.,We live in Oklahoma so our allergies are insane. My daughter has developed my asthma. I bought the air filters with hope that it would stop the sneezing and problems breathing. I also have bought the allergy covers for her bed and pillow.Her breathing has improved as well as her cough and scratching of the throat. She is still sneezing every morning and going through the tissues. We will probably have to get hard wood floors.As for the unit it is worth the money. It not only looks really neat it does pick up all kinds of odors from cleaners to spaghetti o's and will kick on automatically. So you know it is doing something.
5,Superb!,"After some initial research into air filters, I actually came across this filter at my wife's father's house. He has long-suffered with allergies and this was his choice.For me, I live in NYC and was looking for a break from the pollution. From day 1, I slept better after using this filter and still find that the air in my place is easier to breath. It's quiet, sensitive and super effective-totally worth the price."
5,Incredible,I bought this product hoping just to remove some of the dust buildup in my home. I've had it for about two weeks now and am blown away by the benefits of having one of these things. Huge reduction in dust build up; my house smells better; the air feels lighter; I can breathe more easily.If you're considering your first air purifier; as I was; I highly recommend this one. I can't speak as to the differences between this and the other options; but I do know that the benefits of this product greatly outweigh its cost.
5,Seems to work pretty good,"Seems to be pretty good. Arrived quickly, took it from box and plugged it in. Running it in auto mode, it started out toward medium then shortly after worked its way down to low. I put in the semi-finished basement it's working great."
3,It's ok,"Worked great in the beginning. However, after the first time we cleaned all of the parts to the manufacturer's instructions, it seemed to work but it smelled bad. I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix this problem."
1,Surround Air XJ-3800,"I bought this air filter because of dogs and cats and it has really helped with the odor problem. However, I only use the unit at night in my bedroom for a maximum of 6-8 hours. It has been less than 4 months, and the alert light is flashing--indicating I need a new filter. I WILL NOT buy another Surround Air XJ-3800 because of this. I could understand if I ran the unit 24/7, but this is not good.I will start looking for another air purifier."
2,not as good as i expected,"Cons:[---]Came in a box 5 times it's size, thus inevitably the front cover was broken and couldn't stick to the body.[--] After one month of use, it still smells burned plastic.. the funny thing is that this device is supposed to eliminate smells, not produce them!Pros:[++] Dust levels in my bedroom where indeed greatly decreased[++] Cheaper than most products in its category"
5,My wife sleeps again!,"IMy wife has bad allergies, mostly dust related. After reading a zillion Amazon reviews of different air purifiers, I settled on the Surround Air XJ-3800. Impressive name, isn't it? Well, the performance is amazing; my wife slept like a baby the First Night we had this in our bedroom. I won't get into the technical aspects of this purifier, others have done that better than i could. It works. I reccommend it highly."
1,Stupid design,"Self-perpetuating dust problem with unit. You can take the entire front apart to clean everything. Instructions are clear and easy to understand. HOWEVER, you cannot clean the fan in the back of the unit. It gathers dust and keeps blowing it out, which makes the unit pull in more dust and necessitates further cleaning. Why not make the fan accessible? Stupid design."
4,happy,"So far so good! We've had this product plugged up and running for a week now and have noticed a difference in Dust. I like that it ""tells me"" what's going on! We have 2 wood stoves and the dust from those running during the winter was just sickening! LITERALLY! So far we are happy with the purchase....we'll see if it helps with colds and allergies!"
1,Doesn't Work for Odor,"After reading the reviews, I was expecting this purifier to really alleviate the cigarette odor seeping into my apartment. Unfortunately I haven't noticed a difference at all. I've had the product for about month now, and I wish I could return it and get my money back. There are probably better and more affordable purifiers out there.I also think this product was a refurbished/used item, although amazon said it was New."
5,Clears out Smoke and Pet Smells,"We bought this many months ago when our downstairs neighbor's smoke smell was trespassing our apartment. We had tried everything, even mostly sealing the vent (as much as we legally were allowed), but nothing worked. So my boyfriend did a lot of research and we settled on this one. It is VERY quiet, even when running on high, and doesn't take up much space at all, which is nice in a small apartment. We have since moved it to our young daughters room due to our cat peeing in there. After we cleaned the carpet and ran this purifier, we can't smell anything. Our daughter has tried to tip it over, but was unsuccessful, thankfully. My boyfriend has said that it is a bit tedious to clean the filter, as it is very fragile, so I let him do it because I am clumsy. However, you really don't have to clean it that often, and it lets you know with a little light when this is needed, which is nice."
5,"Surround Air ""great unit""","I had purchased this unit about two weeks ago, plugged it in and it works great. I had read a few reviews that said ""loud blower"" and ""smell of burning plastic"" I did not encounter any of the these issues. I can notice that the air on the 2nd floor of the house is cleaner as my kids and I suffer from allergies this has really helped.I have taken the unit part it, and it seems to built pretty decent. The filter and UV light will be simple to replace and maintain in the months to come."
2,Worked great while it worked.,"This thing did an amazing job for about the first nine months I owned it. Today it made a high pitched squeeling sound and smelled of burning plastic. This was about two weeks after cleaning it and replacing the filter, which is not cheap.I'm not going to bother with the warranty since I'd probably lose more than it's worth on the shipping.In the future I'll get a cheaper smaller air purifier instead of investing this kind of cash in a possible lemon."
1,loud noise when plugged in,"when I plug the purifier to the power outlet, it immediately makes very annoying and uncomfortable noise,even without the power on.I have to choose the airflow to the highest level to make the noise less annoying.I bought it because of the good review, sadly, it is so disappointing."
1,air purifier,UV protection didn't work. Sent item back.Product was larger than anticipated. Return was very easy and without question. Purchased a different brand.
1,CHEAP CHINA PRODUCT -- said directly from seller!,"i bought my air purifier directly from the manufacturer and the UV light broke down on me twice. The first time it was after 3 months. They sent a new one out to me, but the second one broke too within 2 months. I now have no UV light purification and have to shop elsewhere. I did not get a refund of any kind. I am unhappy with the seller and that fact it took nearly 4 months for them to sent the second one to me. The seller stated quite clearly that they get their shipments from CHINA and that is why it took so long for me to get my unit replaced. Cheap product and does not work well."
5,Enticing read!,"All the storie is this book are quick, fun & amusing to read. I think everyone who has visited Los Angeles or ones who were raised in ""Another City"" will agree it's a must read. This book also makes a perfectly fitting gift for those."
3,Friendship,Nancy White Carlstrom did a nice job in showing how a fish and a flamingo could break the food chain and share a special gift with each other. I felt that I was left with a cliffhanger. The cliffhanger could be used for a way to have the reader share their own ending.
5,the truest statements,"As owner of The Learn & Play Day care center, I recommend the Perfect Solution by Nancy Y. Wade. It has sparked my concerns as both a parent and a center owner. My concerns for the safety of the young lives in my hands were to such an extent that I implemented new security measures into the center.Owner/Director Learn and Play"
2,Boring,I dont think my 20 month old son liked this one too much. I thought it would have more sound and not be a silent film. He loves animals that is why i got it but i thought it would be more of singing songs also like favorit nursery ryhmes. When i was watching it with him I thought i was going to fall asleep.
2,Not as good as the counting one,"My five month old son loves the first Baby Genius DVD I got him- Children's Favorite Counting Songs; however, this didn't even hold his attention for a few minutes. He just looked away and jumped in his jumperoo. So this DVD kind of bombed..."
1,A Baby Genius disappointment,"Not at all like the other DVD's put out by Baby Genius such as Baby Animals, Counting Songs, ABC's, etc...this is simply a bunch of animals running around to boring music and an occasional pop in by the Baby Genius characters. My little boy expressed zero interest in this DVD after about 7 minutes."
2,not too good,"I wanted to try something new other then Baby einstein, I know every DVD by heart, but my son did not like it at all .. waste of my money"
2,Okey Dokey-Not Great,"My one-and-a-half year old daughter doesn't like this product very much. She finds it boring. The other two products, Baby genius Nursery Rhymes and Children's song are very good, and she likes it very much."
4,Could have been better,"My 2-year-old child likes this video a lot. The music is not your usual classical music heard on other baby videos, and there is a lot of good footage of animals at the San Diego Zoo. Where it falls short in my opinion is that it jumps from scene to scene too quickly, in an almost annoying way. With a little more work this production could have been outstanding. And regarding the bonus song ""Vinko the Dancing Bear"" -- again, my son likes it, but it's really lacking in substance.Baby Genius was really on to something when they started out, with Mozart and Friends, Sleepytime, and Four Seasons. The three videos they made at the San Diego Zoo are only fair, leaving Baby Einstein and others to take over the market."
5,Happy Accident,"I was actually looking for another song when I happened onto ""On a Clear Day."" I liked the song so much that I bought the CD and listened to it over and over for a week straight. Great songs, great arrangements. Alice's songwriting reminds me of Juliana Hatfield and Jeff Buckley- very personal, very emotional. She has a knack for throwing in a minor chord in just the right spot."
2,4 panel black finish room divider,"The item shipped quickly and was well package for shipping. However, the quality of the item is subpar to say the least. The panel is bowed in several areas, making it difficult to stand up. I purchased this item to use as a room divider and photography prop. I am still able to use it for both purposes, however it doesn't look as nice as I had hoped it would. The bowing of the wood really makes the item look cheap and cheesy and I probably won't have it for long because of that."
1,"Cheaper version of Ann Carey's ""The Dachshund""","This book was a big disappointment. Its authors write about different types (colors and markings), but fail to provide pictures of what they actually look like. They also write about specific body parts that they fail to note on their ""External Features Picture"".Basic questions remain unanswered. Mainly, what does a wild boar color look like? And are any colors or types more rare than others are?After reading this book my questions where still unanswered. The same is for Ann Carey's ""The Dachshund"".Maybe I'll try ""Dachshund for Dummies""."
4,good info,I read this book before giving to two new Dachshund owners and I think it will be a good resource book. Nice photos. I liked that I could preview the book before buying it.
4,I love my dogs...,"For those of you who own and love dachshunds, this book is one of the best books for them..."
2,(NOT) Waste of money for live recording!!! (correction),"Basically, I think its a good MD recorder. But, I'd adviseall musicians to NOT assume (like I did) that recordingLIVE music (via mic) to a 1 gig disc was going to give youseemingly an endless amount of recording time on this MDrecorder. You can only record about 1hr + 34min of LIVEmusic(via mic) to a 1 gig disc. etc...*****Correction****************4-Stars!!!The manual says that it can only record in HD mode (which would be 1 1/2hr on a 1 gig MD disc), but for some reason I could change it to SLP/LP which lets you record many hours of recording on each disc. Its great...now!!!"
2,Advertized as new---but was not,"I purchased this kit for and through work, and it arrived with a broken base on the plunge which included a crack through one of the three set screw holes and scratches on the bottom indicating that it had been used before. I wound up simply going to a Dewalt service center to order a replacement base---which is two weeks out. The function of the plunge does not glide as well as a larger plunge Dewalt that I also ownn which all adds up to a huge disapointment. Skip this model---and vendor---if you can!"
1,No more Combo routers for me,"The router I received is great with the fixed base. The motor won't fit into the plunge base, and the plunge base came with a broken sub-base. I should have gone with the dedicated plunge router. DeWalt deserves a black eye for their lack of Product QA."
2,"Not bad for light work, but burnt out on heavier use","I've used this router off and on for 4-5 years, and was generally happy when using it in handheld applications. Enough power for smaller work - rabbets, dovetails, etc, but not good for bigger bits. I had it setup in my router table and was taking a fairly large round-over bit to about 100 feet of doug-fir. About halfway through the mechanism stuttered, overheated and died on me today. I probably won't buy another to replace it."
3,Missing parts,This was a gift for my husband and it arrived missing 2 parts. He called the company 2 days ago and they said they would send them. Let's hope they do. What a bummer!
2,Could be outstanding,"I've had this router for a 2-3 years. When it's working, it's great. The problem is that it's often broken. The main bearing on mine overheated and failed shortly after I bought it. I sent it in to the service center, where they repaired it. After relatively little use, the main bearing failed again today. I only use it occasionally, so I'm sure it wasn't from normal wear. Besides, I've got cheaper and older routers that have seen much harder use and still work. I'm not impressed. Now I have to either buy a new motor and hope it's better, or scrap the whole thing. Argg."
2,Motor Died,"I loved my router until the motor died. I don't think I got a lot of use out of my router before it died. I used it off an on for about 11 months... but it probably ran for a cumulative 20-30 hours over that period. Given that DeWalt is supposed to be the professional/industrial end of Black & Decker, I was extremely dissapointed when the router motor just stopped. Turned out that the magnet in the motor broke apart. This is a problem that seems common with this router. Fortunately, it was under warrenty. DeWalt fixed it in 4 weeks (that gave me four weeks to contemplate what other brand I will buy now) when they said it would be 1 week. They also did a lousy job fixing it. They arranged it so that I cannot tighten my collet to the point where I think it presents a danger."
2,Missed Potential,"I purchased this combo set at a tool show and returned it the next day. Problems being that some parts were missing and the plastic portion on the plunge base was cracked. I am sure they would have exchanged it, but it doesn't say much for future durability. Dewalt is usually great. I have a lot of their stuff. I'm sure they will get this combo set right with a few more months under their belt. In the meantime I picked up the Bosch - It seems more durable, came with a great edge guide and is a pleasure to work with."
5,Router Set,"This was my first router combo set I've ever used, and I am AMAZED at how easily I have gotten to learn how to use it. Dewalt, as always, has never failed me with their products and I cannot complain at ALL. GREAT SET! A+"
4,Good Router Combo Kit,"I have used this router kit for several months and am generally pleased with it. Here's my pro's and con's:Pro's - strong soft start motor, easy and precise depth adjustment, easy to change motor between bases, smooth plunge action with positive depth stops, ability to use 1/4"" and 1/2"" bits.Con's - fingers on 1/4"" collet broke the first time I used it (was quickly replaced by DeWalt), power switch too small and difficult to turn off especially in an emergency (a trigger on the handle would be better), hard case too big and clunky, when motor is on the plunge base, the unit cannot be stored in the hard case so motor must be removed and put on fixed base every time you put the tool away."
4,Great quality product,"Product is everything it is said to be. I had an old craftsman router that works well, but has none of the features I wanted on a router. The soft start is a super feature. No pull at all when it fires up. Routing detailed display cases has work has worked very well, soft and hard wood. Dust collection thru the column is a challenge. Can't find the correct fitting for my ridgid vac. ?? Had to call DeWalt for the centering guide and the pin. That is the reason for the four stars vs. five. They did send it out immediately, no questions asked. I don't have any quality issues with this product."
5,Best kit you will find,"This is a great kit. Someone in marketing is listening to the consumer wish list. Removable cord set, no tool motor removal, variable speed, etc. I look at many before deciding to go with this one. I made the right choice. But that said, I still don't think the guys who design the units ever actually use them to make anything. The only thing I don't like about the kit is in the fixed base unit. The motor is too close to the dust collection tube. It makes it hard to get the motor in and out. It helps to remove the cap on the top. But other than that, all thumbs up!!"
2,Author uses terms he does not understand and is giving incorrect advice,"As a student of behavior science and training, I am appalled by the author's misuse of the term ""negative reinforcement"" (pg. 233). The author shows ignorance of what negative reinforcement means. He misuses negative reinforcement apparently thinking it to be equivalent to punishment. Negative reinforcement is not punishment according to the science of behavior and training. Negative reinforcement and punishment are two different training responses or methods. The author claims to be an expert in training and does not understand what a basic training term such as negative reinforcement means. Maybe he just defines his terms anyway he pleases?"
5,Very interesting--offers a very good overview!,"This book does cover some topics which some may refer to as ""hocus-pocus."" However, most of the information in this book is very helpful and if you can keep an open mind and get beyond some of the unusual methods the writer has utilized in healing her animals, you will benefit from the overall knowledge of various methods of holistic treatments. This is the best compilation I've come across so far in explaining the various holistic methods of treatment. Also, this is a good addition to your canine nutrition library."
5,A must have,I am thrilled.every horse owner should have it.Even you can discuss if grain is necessary or not it is really helpful.
5,The Holistic Guide for a Healthy Dog,"If you are to have one great book on learning about nutrition and what the vets don't explain and what you need to learn, this is the one to have. Wendy has been the pioneer on research when it comes to feeding our dogs. This includes how to read blood work and what it means. Why feeding our dogs correctly is SOO important and how we can achieve ultimate health for our companions. I would highly recommend the soft cover edition also as this would complete your library if you are at all interested in learning about nutrition for your dog. You should also check out the Volhard nutrition list on Yahoo where Volhard staff are there to help with your questions!!!"
1,the holistic guide for a healthy dog,"The book was in very good condition as promised, although, the book itself was worthless, completely unintelligible. This, of course, was absolutely no fault of the seller."
3,Clip lever broke,"The clip lever broke, so it is now difficult to get on my belt (or pants if I'm not wearing a belt). This has happened before, and the folks at Fellowes (who make the holster for Body Glove) were kind enuf to send me a new holster.I bought it at Walmart, but they don't carry it any more and Fellowes (apparently) doesn't make it anymore (can't recall the model #), so I guess I'm SOL. Too bad... this was the most convenient holster I have ever used. Minus the bad clip, I'd have given this 5 stars."
2,Good service but trombone slide is problematic,The service was wonderful. The trombone produced great sound. The only problem is the slide. I had to ask for a replacement but the replacement did not match the trombone so I had to file it down in order to connect it with the trombone. And very soon the inside of new slide started to rust as well. It is really a pity. It gets harder and harder to pull the slide that you really can't play your instrument easily.
2,Nice while it lasted,"I had this P.S. for about a year, then it [stopped] on me. Luckly, I had an old P.S. that came with a case I had bought and it worked just fine. So, I know that it was the Enermax that had failed. It worked very good for a year but, I think I will try Antec now instead. Too much money for for something that only last a year."
4,2 guys/IT'S HUGE,"Two guys-I've seen them play. Live they sound huge-same on this record. The music's kinda freaky-it rocks, but it's actually got something all it's own-Can't say that about much these days."
5,Top quality clean smoking wood,"While this is among the more expensive smoking wood I've purchased it is easily the best quality. Few of the pieces have any bark on them, and this is important if you want to avoid off flavors. The wood was clean, dry and well packaged. While I have several other smoke woods on hand, this is the one I keep going back to. It is being used both for grilling and long low temperature BBQ cooking and works well for either."
5,awesome stuff,"Use this in my Rocky Mountain Propane Smoker and the chunks last almost 5 hours. I supplement the chunks with hickory chips and Big Chief smoker dust just to get the process rolling, but the chunks give a pretty consistent burn and pleasant smoke flavor to my ribs and pork roasts."
4,I'm sick of the news; it's the same everyday,It makes my my unflatteringly wavy hair straighter and with minimum frizz. Good for us ladies and gentlement who are too lazy or with hair too short to use a flat iron (though the results aren't as good as a flat iron. This is just like a bit of touch-up.)-1 star because it doesn't make my hair feel as clean as other shampoo.But I highly recommend it.There's something so funny about writing a review for shampoo..
5,"The best shampoo, if you can find it!!!!",This is the best shampoo! I am so sad they stopped making it! I have the frizziest hair and this is the ONLY product that makes me like my hair! Now they changed the formula and the new one does not compare!! Bring it back John Frieda!!
4,"Good Shampoo, Arrived on time","I'm a fan of John Frieda, and I've used this shampoo before: I just didn't want to have to go out and get it in a store, since I don't own a car in the Upstate New York town where I live. I'm pleased: the shampoo arrived quickly, and it does its job."
5,Leaving Las Vegas,This movie is a very good drama about two people who are suffering under the affliction of their life styles and become best friends and fall in love at the very end.Nicolas Cage gave a great performance in this movie.Elizabeth Shue was outstanding as always.I wish she would make more movies.
3,Leaving Las Vegas,"I watched Leaving Las vegas three times,each time rewinding my video with more of a sense of confusion.I understood the somewhat subtle plot and tried to come into terms with the characters in the movie.Nicolas Cage is great in this film dont get me wrong,but his character seemed very imaginary and unfruitful.Liz Shue's acting was also praisworthy however thin her appearance seemed.One has a sense that there is some part of the film missing,could be Im wrong but I failed to find the significance of the other characters in the film i.e-the Russian ""pimp"",If youre not into non linear films with strange scenes appearing from out of the blue give this a miss,but if you like a well portrayed broken man with a serious drinking problem and a suicidal view on life then check out this one."
2,Arriving in Trite Town,Mannered acting and an agglomeration of late 20th century cinematic cliches -- the tart with a heart; the pimp with half a heart; the interminable cutesy-gawky therapy sessions -- grab an Oscar jury by the throat...and choke it.
1,Is it too late to ask why?,Self-centered people who lack any self-awareness engaging in stupid behaviour is not tragedy; it's just a pointless waste of time for its viewers. Add in a soundtrack that has all the nuance of a Mickey Mouse cartoon and it's enought to make you demand your money back.
4,.,"Powerful and very well-acted. I'm not that keen on Elizabeth Shue, but she manages okay, and Nicolas Cage is brilliant. It's embarassing to see this and then think of what he's done since. In any case, I didn't feel Leaving Las Vegas was flawless (the end struck me as a bit much), but the drama is compelling. Hopelessly and mercilessly depressing -- it left me feeling almost frighteningly cold and numb on a number of levels. I would never criticize a movie for being depressing, but just be aware of what you're getting into when you sit down with this one."
5,Leaving Las Vegas paints an amazing picture,"I have never seen a movie that shows somebody's problem and addiction in such a round and honest way. With both Cage and Shue, these were the performances of a lifetime. Leaving Las Vegas was a very depressing movie, if not the most depressing that I have ever seen. It was funny, strangely romantic, violent, and depressing all at once. This film just painted such a vivid picture of a man who totally drinks himself away and the prostitute who fell in love with him. This was a very daring and original film. I would not recommend that any children should see it. Its R rating is well-deserved, for pervasive extreme alcohol abuse, strong sexual content including some nudity, language, and violece including a rape. Leaving Las Vegas is not the feel-good movie of the year at all. It is just an incredible film with very depressing elements. I give it five stars for the performances, the dialogue, the directing, the makeup, and the film as a whole."
2,"Good Acting, Bad Theme",The acting of both Cage and Shue is excellent without doubt. They make you believe their role is who really they are. The thing I don't understand about the film is what good does it bring to us. I'm saying that because if you are a normal person with a ordinary mind you will feel very sad and dissapointed at the end of the movie. You will not actually learn anything from the movie but to pretent you've found yourself a reason to excuse those who waste thier lifes as hookers and drunks. I personally recommand this movie to those who have a happy life because you may say to yourself thankgod I am not like that.
2,More Nihilism From Hollywood,"More nihilism posing as art. ""Let's watch pathetic people doing degrading things to each other!"" seems to be the Hollywood motto nowadays. They produce it in abundance, then award it all the academy awards they possibly can (see ""American Beauty"").The rape scene in this flick is shameless, particularly the ""humor"" about Shue's character not being able to sit down afterwards. Still, most of my male friends focused their attention on how ""HOT"" Shue was in it, as some of these reviewers have also done. Am I the only one who sees something incredibly wrong in that?!?!? Have you ever noticed that rape victims in films are almost exclusively attractive? Have you ever wondered why that is?Sensationalism. Titillation. We all fall victim to these things from time to time, but we don't usually mistake them for art."
4,"Good Acting, Bad Acting","I watched this film on DVD & for anyone who is curious about this picture here's one opinion; The acting is really good in some scenes and hollow in other scenes. I loved the opening, it really sets up Cage's charactor. I would recomend this film to anyone who likes a good story, the only problum is that the story is a little weak in some areas, particularly why Sera is in love with Ben. There are really no special features worth buying this DVD for, but the picture & sound quality are still better than anything VHS, so if you want to own this film I would suggest DVD format. In summery... A film worth seeing, but in moderation."
2,"I get the point, but..","I understand this movie is about ""unconditional love"". I also realize there are some great performances here - that's why I gave it two stars. But it is so depressing! It's O.K. for movies to be dark, somber, and even depressing if they have some kind of social statement to make. But what does this movie say? That if a loved one is engaging in self-destructive behaviour, you shouldn't try to get them help? That you can't love someone and still refuse to condone what they are doing? Sorry, they missed the boat on this one."
4,Terrible Sound Mix,"If you watch this film, you will find yourself turning the volume way up during any dialog. When any music is played (or sound effects), you will RUSH to turn the volume down by about 40 to 70%. This film has, by far, the wrost sound-mix of any DVD I've watched. On top of that, the soundtrack is kind of annoying, and detracts from the film often. Nevertheless, its still a good film, despite the above."
1,Do not waste your money on the Blu-ray version.,"This is a good film but the quality falls way short of Blu-ray capabilities and many SD DVD releases - in a word ""dire"". Releasing films with such poor picture quality could make Blu-ray, already off to a poor start a non-starter. We need some sort of vetting that stops such poor quality films/transfers being released on Blu-ray before we can take the Blu-ray format to mean better picture quality and not just higher cost than standard DVD."
4,Addiction movie almost on the level with 'Panic in Needle Park'.,"This Oscar winner works on two main levels. The first is Cage's portrayal of an unapologetic drunk who realizes that he is trying to kill himself with alcohol. He won the Academy Award that year and deservedly so. The prostitution angle is even more gruesome.I can watch this movie over and over. It is not for the faint of heart. I love the Las Vegas emphasis. But Nicolas Cage is making the best performance of his long career, and I say 'Thank You' to him and the film makers. Cage vaults to the level of Al Pacino on this one."
1,Leave This movie,"Mike Figgis directs this indie offbeat drama that presents the strange and unusual relationship between Ben (Nicolas Cage), a lonesome alcoholic, and Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a crestfallen prostitute. They get to know each other in Las Vegas, since Ben went there to spend all his money and die. What we have here is an intriguing premise that fails to recieve a compelling development, delivering a melodramatic, dull, repetitive and annoying love story between two uninteresting characters. Nicolas Cage spends half the screen time drunk, making his character an irritating and sappy individual, and Elisabeth Shue gives a fine performance in a movie that doesn`t deserve it. ""Leaving Las Vegas"" tries to be subtle, introspective, intelligent and moving, but it ends up being contrived, boring, patchy and disposable.This film deserves a skip."
1,Leaving Las Vegas (Movie),"The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points. The wrong movie was delivered. I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas. And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas. So that was bad."
1,I wanted my money and my time back!!!,"This was the worst movie I ever watched. I kept watching it thinking there would be SOME moment of redemption, something worth the cost of the rental! I wished at the end that I had given up on it as quickly as the characters gave up on themselves. I think the character Nicholas Cage played was as addicted to self-pity as he was to alcohol. Okay, maybe there are people out there who let themselves get this bad, but do the rest of us really need to watch it for 2 hours? I couldn't believe this movie won so many awards."
1,Really tragic,"I totally agree with Natasha. Just hope I can give this thing negative stars. This is trully a fake, over-acted, sickly sentimental cr** that doesn't touch the real tragedy of life at all. There is no truth in this film. Shallow!"
5,One of the best of the 90s,"Brutally realistic and graphically explicit, Leaving Las Vegas is one of those rare films which bring glorious hope and utter sadness at the same time (see Kramer v. Kramer & The Shawshank Redemption). I don't know which part of the film gives hope, but it does somehow got to do with the Cage-Shue chemistry and their powerful, bravura performances which may be THE two best of the decade. Cage shows he is the #1 of his generation in Hollywood, and Shue proves herself at last, breaking from the girl-next-door persona. Mike Figgis is the real hero here, with graphic scenes and surprisingly romantic atmospheres. This movie isn't for everybody, it's for open-minded people, the same who would understand & enjoy The People Vs. Larry Flynt and Boogie Nights."
2,Overblown manure. An insult to us all.,"I don't know what movie you all are reviewing, but the Leaving Las Vegas I saw was one of the most over-hyped, overblown, pseudo-intelligent movies I have ever seen. That's all I'll say. Perhaps I had overly large expectations due to the fact that this movie ran away with an Oscar or two, but this movie fell short on all possible levels. Frankly, I think its an insult to us all, a movie that tries to make a statement about how love can transcend boundaries but falls about 3.5 times short of a good story and plot. I've seen plenty of good movies in my day, and this is not one of them. For the record, it rates up there with movies like ""Dead Man on Campus"", ""Howard the Duck"" and ""the Bodyguard"" as the worst movies I've ever seen."
3,"Two stars for Cage and one for Shue, but.......",this is an EXTREMELY depressing movie to watch. I have rarely felt so down after watching a movie as I did after this one. It has a lot to commend in its performances but the story is not that interesting. It comes down to a man wanting to drink himself to death and succeeding. Shue is just along for the ride. The performances are good but the movie is dark and depressing.
5,A powerful drama,An extremely well acted intense drama that leaves a lasting impression . I doubt Nicholas Cage can top this performance .
1,A Real Downer !!!,"If your idea of being entertained is to be brought as emotionally low as it is possible to feel, this is your perfect vehicle for getting there. Otherwise, do not waste your hard-earned money on this piece of garbage."
1,Painful at best,"Movies are an escape for most of us. We enjoy the exhillaration of relating to the characters and blowing stuff up like Arnold or getting the girl like James Bond. Movie character get to do the things we fantasize about doing. I don't fantasize about dying a slow and wretched death while humiliating myself in the process. Perhaps there's some deeper meaning here I'm missing. Not! This movie is worse than boring. It is hours of painfull, torturous, insipid, doleful agony."
1,Highly offensive,"I couldn't stomach this movie for long. I kept waiting, hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge but the language, nudity, and explicit sexual content was too much for me so I turned it off and never saw the entire film. If there was any poignant, brilliant story with any depth, it was buried in filth and raunch. I would not recommend film this to anyone. Nicholas Cage or not, it was disgusting."
2,Depressing and sad movie,"This movie was depressing and sad. I could identify with parts of it, because we have alcoholism in our family. I kept hoping for a miracle to happen...a recovery...but to me, it was just sad, depressing and pathetic. But, Nicholas Cage did a fantastic job of acting!"
4,Decent film,"I enjoyed this movie, even though it had made me really thirsty at times. I thought Nicolas Cage's acting was exceptional. It's a pity he hasn't done anything this good in decades.A coupla things bothered me. I didn't feel Elizabeth Shue was quite right for the role of the hooker.She's a decent actress, but are hookers really that hot? I've never been with one, but from all the hundreds of police show mug shots I've seen over the years I don't believe I've ever seen one that hot. Maybe the police just arrest the ugly ones.And why was Shue’s street dress that high up? The top part was almost up to her tits. Didn't seem quite right. Overall the movie was great because I cared about the characters and wanted to watch the thing till the end, which is a rarity for movies these days. Highly recommended for alcoholics and non-alcoholics alike."
3,Very simple and basic,"I was disappointed in this book. It seemed to be written for young people. (I would recommend it for teenagers.) If you're an adult, choose something else."
2,Tarnished Scholarship,"Dr. Neil R. Lightfoot provides an overview of the collation of the Biblical text. He provides sufficient detail for understanding various components of such a complex history. However, the lower rating derives from repeated frustration at perceived apologetic overtones throughout the book. For example, on page 29 he discusses the fact that the original New Testament manuscripts were written in the contemporaneously common Greek language. He ascribes this to ""the providence of God, since the gospel was to be proclaimed to every creature, that the New Testament writers made use of a language that was known throughout the Mediterranean world."" Such unsubstantiated assertions (and his near polemical treatment of the uncanonized status of the apocryphal texts in Chapter 15) mar an otherwise decent exposition. I would advise looking elsewhere for a less overtly-biased historical account."
3,Good information but biased...,"Lightfoot does present some good information relative to how the Bible arrived in its current form, but he does so with a bias. For example, when explaining why the Catholic Bible has more books than Protestant versions of the Bible, Lightfoot flat out declares that the Catholic Bible is wrong to include these books, and that the Catholic inclusion of those books should be rejected. He also makes it a point to relegate the Catholic Church to a position of near insignificance in determining which core books compose the Bible. I just wanted the facts, or at the very least - both sides of the argument. Tell me why one Bible has them and why one doesn't. I'm doing research here - and was expecting an objective analysis of ""How We Got the Bible,"" not an ideological argument in favor of the Protestant Bible. Having said that - still some very good info in this book, especially when it concerns ancient texts that served as the basis for modern translations of the Bible."
5,Great source material,Lightfoot does and excellent job of detailing the process by which we have as our Bible today. A must for Bible scholars and those of faith. This is a true faith builder and excellent source for those doubters still out there.
4,How we got the Bible,"We are using this book in our church school class for adults and are into chapter 2. At this point, we like the readability and organization of text. The discussion questions at end of chapter are good."
2,Need to Believe,"To me, this would have been a much better book had the author stuck to the research and not always brought in the faith and belief aspect. This is a failed scholarly work with the bias of the author--maybe intended. Every religion has their own ancient books and mythology. But Lightfoot NEVER mentions any other religions. This is somewhat understandable, but diminishes the worth of this book."
5,Hard to Put Down,"This book is very well written and makes a wonderful study guide for anyone who wishes to study the history of the Bible either alone or as part of a study group. Once you begin to read it, it is difficult to put it down."
2,A Christian apologist's view of Bible history,"Neil Lightfoot has written this slim, and I'm afraid rathershallow book to help Christians bolster their faith ratherthan shed light on the objective and all too obscurefacts surrounding the origins of the most popular bookever written.All in all, it's fine for a sunday school class that isn'tall that serious about the subject, but it doesn't do muchfor someone really wanting to know *all* the facts, positiveand negative, about the history of the Bible."
3,Missing pieces of history,"To be fair, what this book does cover was done very well. The primary focus of the book demonstrates and does a good job proving that the texts we use today in the Bible have been accurately passed through the years. The author presented abundant information in this regard.Where the book falls short is the discussion of how the canon came together. Why did the letter to Jude get included? Didn't Paul write some other letters?The author relies too much on the reader's faith in the Bible and reinforces their affirmation that the Bible is true. I was expecting more history of how the original texts were included in the first place."
4,How We Got the Bible,"""How We Got the Bible"" is a very interesting and informative narrative of how the bible text was recorded through history and how accurate the current versions are."
1,Very poor quality binding,"The binding of this book is a glue-only construction of extremely low quality --- no stitching, just a stack of pages glued together. The book cannot lie open, nor close properly. Print quality is also very low. The lack of quality in construction of this book is not consistent with its price."
2,Are Prophecy and Order the correct categories for summarizing medieval Christianity?,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. It's scope was fairly limited, and while the premise appeared to be that medieval Christianity was developed by competing notions of prophecy and order, this work neither substantiated the claim with any truly academic prowess, nor did it really stand out in the long list of historical accounts of Christianity. Overall, the sources seemed a bit dated and wooden. Not something that I would recommend, except as a supplementary perspective on the history of Christianity."
4,The cd was ok but.....,"The cd was ok, but i'm not a big Kid Rock or Slipnot Fan. I love Korn and wish they had put more of their stuff it in....I dont always enjoy screaming obsenities, and niether do my parents so i found this cd great! it also has bands i'd heaard of but never heard until now."
2,TODAY'S ROCK IS NOT ROCK ANYMORE.,"IF YOU LIKE REAL, STRAIGHT ROCK - THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. YOU WOULD BE MORE THAN DISSAPOINTED. TODAY'S MUSIC CALLED 'ROCK' IS RATHER ROCK-RAP WHERE YOU HEAR A LOT OF NOT PROPER WORDS. IT'S NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE CALLED MUSIC - IT'S JUST SOMETHING WHAT IMITATES IT.BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE IT; THAN THERE'S ONLY ABOUT 5-7 SONGS ON THIS CD THAT ARE GOOD, INCLUDING: KORN - MAKE ME BAD (SICKNESS IN SALVATION MIX)."
5,nice accessory,"Looks nice, seems sturdy. A little weird that the top can come completely off(discovered by accident) but I'm sure it's an intentional feature."
4,Perfect for a small collection,"I needed someplace to store a collection of about 30 albums and was surprised to find so few options available. This case will work great. It looks better in person than in the picture and will fit most any decor. Definitely shouldn't be hidden away in the closet. I'm skeptical about it holding 50 albums, but several of mine are gatefold so maybe? The case is much heavier than anticipated as well, which I believe speaks to the quality of the materials used. It lost a star from me for the hinge design. Apparently, it's intended that the lid comes fully off when you open it. It will hang open, but only if you place the lid back on the hinges after you open it. Not a big deal -- when closed the lid seems securely attached for carrying. Just a bit odd and sometimes inconvenient. I would recommend the product and am considering buying the 7in version as well."
4,I HIGHLY RECOMMED THIS PRODUCT-CROSLEY CR401 - TA RECORD CARRIER CASE,"I WANTED SOMETHING TO PUT MY ALBUM'S IN THAT WOULD BE ANTIQUE LOOKING. I WAS VERYPLEASED WITH THE CORSLEY CARRIER CASE. IT IS VERY WELL MADE, LOOKS VERY NICE ANDSPACIOUS ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL MY ALBUMS."
4,Looking Good!,A great comedy album by someone who died way too soon. Freddie Prinze uses his experiences of growing up in ethnic New York to put humor into not so humorous everyday occurences.
4,Incomplete Soundtrack,"Of all the James Bond soundtracks issued, this is on the bottom of my list. I am not saying that the score heard in the film was bad. I am saying that this is not the score I heard in the film. I am not sure what it is. It is reminiscent of soundtracks issued during the 1950s where composers rearranged their film scores for commercial record albums.Composer, Marvin Hamlisch recorded the music in the film very well and seemed to be quite intuitive on what was required for different scenes. I believe that composers writing a Bond score are given great liberty to call upon previous musical cues from earlier entries in the series and write them into the score. It is very possible that Hamlisch was permitted to include only his original compositions for this album."
5,Back to full use!,"This drive is brought my laptop back to ""as new"" performance. It was packed well, and came alive with very little work."
3,"I though it was more ""Visual""","In the truth when I purchased this book, I hoped it was more ""visual"". I was searching for a book about dinosaurs with the most of contents as detailed images. But found just another book about dinosaurs with few photo/images.So... not particularly...VISUAL :("
4,Want to be a knowitall about dinosaurs?,"Although this is a small book, it's thick and chock full of dinosaurs. What's really great is it isn't jut you t-Rex and raptor stuff it's much more in depth.There are plenty of ones you probably have never even heard of, let alone have facts about their size and qualities.This book is more suitable for older kids but one to read at bedtime until they are olderLots of stuff very hard to find online easily."
4,Nice little book,"Keep the dimensions in mind when you buy this one.Even with it's small size though you do get quite a bit of information and a lot of nice visuals on each page. It's is a pretty comprehensive guide to a lot of the 'standard' dinos out there and a few you've never heard of. It also sticks mostly to the subject. It does go a bit outside of the dino info and into some early mammals but all around, it's a great little encyclopedia."
3,pint-sized encyclopedia,"I'm a little disappointed but I should have double checked the dimensions. When you think encyclopedia, you imagine a heavy book. So, to my dismay, when I opened up the shipping box I discovered that the book was about the size of my hand. I showed this book to my family and they even laughed at it. As an artist, I wanted this book for reference. You'd think a book that prominently displays VISUAL in its title would be better suited in a large format. Especially considering the subject matter. I've flipped through the pages and see that the images are quite beautiful but it's a shame that it's contained in such a small book. I am not reviewing this book on content but rather the presentation of the material. This is a review to warn others who had similar expectations."
5,Exquisite Erudition - A Masterpiece.,"A Short History of Shakespearean Criticism is a cathedral of a book. I should admit that I am susceptible to the radiance of thoughts about thoughts about Shakespeare's thoughts. I will simply say that I have seldom read a more balanced and less biased study. I only wish it was several volumes long. I believe each chapter sent me into flights of philosophy and pleasure. I hope that anyone who has a taste for lit-crit and a true, deep love of the Bard will read this book. It fell into my hands as if by magic and I recommend it without any reservations. JCSMITHSON."
4,"It was not as white as in the picture, but I liked it.","I expected a beautiful white design on a black background. But it turned out to be a creamy yellow design. The total canvas was very dark. It still is pretty, and I kept it. But I was a little disappointed."
1,MISLEADING PICTURE,"I ordered this item largely because the picture clearly shows that the compass was made in Finland. When it showed up I was very disappointed to see that mine was made not in Finland, but in Indonesia. If I would've known that it was made in Indo-China I wouldn't have paid more than $5 for it, or bought it at all for that matter. This is a cheap plastic compass and the quality is very much what you'd expect from a MADE IN CHINA piece. In short, I got ripped off by this ad with their deceptive misleading picture. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"
3,Cheaply made,"Just got this compass today and I'm not too impressed with it. It is made of a a pretty flimsy plastic housing and I think it is only a matter of time till the cover breaks off. (Not actual hinges - just a piece of plastic connecting cover to base plate). The mechanism itself seems to work fine though. I just found out that apparently, Silvas which are purchased in the US are not actually made by the European Silva brand and that these are a junky knock-off. I'm just going to get a good ol' Cammenga lensatic compass for a few extra bucks and not have to worry about quality or reliability.BTW, you will not be able to return this item to Amazon since it contains ""hazardous material"". (the liquid inside I guess). Lame."
4,Silva compass,Was as advertised. Plastic body should work in salt water. Bright color should make it easy to find. The lanyard cord was pretty thin and flimsy.
5,LeCreuset Grill is the best!!,"I love this grill, any grill will spatter from the fat from the meat. I never put oil on a grill, it will only dance right out. 99 % of all grill pans on the market have low sides?????????? Adding a cover wouldn't be grilling. The secret to heating is: put it on your burner and let it heat up slowly regardless of where your burners are, you can use 1 or 2 I do it all of the time. You just have to let it sit and heat till the whole grill is hot.I love this grill!!! My cooktop is solid, so it cleans right up!"
5,Great resource for Joes and 1st gen Philippinos,"I am a first generation immigrant and my work an office in Manila. I found the book insightful for understanding my parents, my relatives, and my culture. I also found it a good resource to give to a (culturally) American coworker who will be in our Manila office for just over a month. It clearly states Flip customs, habits, quirks, or viewpoints. Gives appropriate and inappropriate responses and behaviors without being condescending. I can't help but be encouraged and sometimes laugh at the illustrations that do so much to capture the nuances and defuse some of the awkwardness ... ie, the illustration of ""pointing with your lips"" both makes the instance very clear without making it seem outlandish. So for any American or ""Joe"" traveling to the Philippines, any of us born outside the Philippines doing your ""roots"" trip, or anyone who wants to know more about us as a people, I'd recommend this book."
4,Super router,"What a great router. I purchased a Porter-Cable 2hp plunge router 97529 and thought it would be great. Boy was I wrong, junk, that's all I have to say about that thing.Although this router is 1 hp it acts like the big boys. I've used this router with a 3"" panel bit on maple and it worked fine. The plunge base is very smooth and the locking leaver works well. Even if male hormones dictate the purchase of a more powerful router, don't, this is all you need."
4,"A classic Anime , hope you lower the price","I had the opportunity of watching this anime about seven years ago in VHS, about one week ago , I saw it on DVD and wow !!! it was really a good experience to see it again. It is a shame that the story seems somewhat incomplete we never get the opportunity to see Megazone 23's enemies and there is no conclusion to the BD problem..is he evil or not?, what is he tryint to do? , there is a sex scene here, and also a love story inside the movie. I hope someday , a director tries to improve the story and the characters in an updated version of Megazone 23, it is truly a classic.The animation is good overall , considering that it was 1986 when this anime was released."
3,Megazone 23...the original (SPOILERS),"Well, I paid $21.99 for this DVD, was it worth the price?Not really.I will show the greatness of MZ 23, and then it's drawbacks.MZ's greatness- The story is original.The Garland mech is sweet, and an innovative design overall.Eve was/is a cool digital pop idol before Sharon Apple even hit the radar.Mikimoto's art is sublime (in an 80's kind of way)...MZ's drawbacks- It is sooo 1980s. I mean, in a painful way. But not as 1980s a Part II, ick.It drags on, and on, and on...with next to no action.The ending is well, not an ending. It makes you think Shogo is running, severely injured, trying to reunite with Yui, but Part II proves that assumption dead in the water.It has nudity, which is tastefully done I might add, but it might be a drawback for some.If you can snag it for $15 or under it is a solid buy for the retro 80's effect. But at what I paid, um not a good value."
4,Nice Jars,"The smooth jars are great for craft projects, various uses around the house, and allow for labeling on the jar to show off your canned products."
1,Poor Technique,"A very poor instructional tape. Poor Technique. No explanation of the proceedure to execute the move shown. Poor video technique (ie the opponent is dressed in red performing on a red mat). After the opponent is subdued he stands at the opponents feet (the worst place you could stand, especially if the man hasa gun yet to be pulled) and waves his stick or knife around, which is useless if the man is down. A total waste of money.Doyle2nd Dan Hapkido"
5,Complete package perfect for a beginner!,"I purchased the Deluxe Learning Edition and am very pleased with what I got. I was a little nervous ordering it at first because of the previous reviews stating that the bundle did not include all of the disks.My package did contain ALL the necessary disks. My box contained 6 disks:1) Visual Basic.Net Standard Disk2) Visual Studio.Net Development Environment Disk3) Complete MSDN Library 3-Disk Set4) Visual Basic.Net Step by Step Sample Disk from the Book5) 'Visual Basic.Net Step by Step' Book.I am a beginner VB programmer and find the book very easy to follow. For those of you that may have learned Visual Basic 6, the author starts out each chapter by describing the general changes between VB6 and VB.Net.Overall, I find this Deluxe Learning Edition to be an excellent value. Let's just hope Microsoft now has their packaging right!"
1,No HELP Files included with software,"It is of little comfort that another reviewer highlights the serious oversight by Microsoft to not include the HELP files for the Visual Basic .net 2003 software in this training kit.I am new to this product and need as much help and reassurance to guide me through the product. Essential to this journey is the HELP file, which requires a MSDN CD to setup - but is not supplied with the CD.Does anyone from Microsoft care to comment as I would like the HELP file, but am at a loss as what to do?Unfortunately I agree with my fellow reviewer than without the HELP files this product cannot progress past 1 star.Sorry, but I cannot recommend this product at this stage."
3,Get the help files from Microsoft,I phoned Microsoft (here in the UK) and they admitted it was a mistake to omit the help files CD - they are posting mine. Still it took 30 minutes on the phone to find someone who knew what they were talking about ... The book is ok but I prefer the much larger Programming VB.NET.
2,"Book OK, but no product key!","The book that comes with this package is MS Visual Basic.Net Step by Step. Despite the author's claim that the book appeals to beginners and experienced programmers alike, it is more of a beginner's book. Nonetheless it provides a structured introduction to to VB.NET and that appealed to me because my work in VB to date has always been driven by a deadline, and I have used techniques that perhaps aren't optimal but nonetheless work. However, I cannot find a Product Key in the package! I opened another of this product in a bookshop and could find no product key in that either. So I can't tell you anything about the software, but if anybody can send me a product key for this product (enquiries are being made at Microsoft but God knows how long that's going to take) I would be very grateful."
3,Missing MSDN Discs,"As with many of the posts that I have seen, my Deluxe edition did not come with the MSDN CD(s). It would have been nice to see a ""contents"" list on the side of the box, as until I did some searching I was not sure if I was even supposed to receive them. I made a quick call to Microsoft and they have arranged to ship the missing material right away."
1,Should have read reviews...,"Got this yesterday, should have read the bad reviews before ordering it. Got two books, one big one, that refers to a disk with sample exercies that doesn't exist and another book that has VS Express 2005, which is useless, I can download 2008 for free from microsoft website.Thanks to Amazon's restock fee, I will probably keep it, but am very disappointed, needed what I ordered to be what was advertised as I am studying for job."
5,A MUST HAVE,"IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, IF YOU DO BABY-SITTING, OR IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR CARE, THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK. IT'S EVEN MORE VALUABLE TODAY THEN WHEN IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED 22 YEARS AGO. I GUESS THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO PUT A ""TIME-TAG"" ON THE BEST."
2,Not what I hoped for this time,"This book is really comprehensive, but it is for younger eyes. It is so small and the writing so small. I am not sure it will be of use to me. But, the book arrived quickly. My problem is not with the purchase, just my own old eyes!"
3,"better than nothing, but preferred Berlitz Turkish phrasebook","In the bookstore, I compared this Lonely Planet Turkish with the newer Berlitz Turkish phrasebook/dictionary. Even though Tom, the writer is an expert, I bought the Berlitz offering instead of this LP product. LP Turkish phrasebook does have a nice attractive layout and reasonably comprehensive entries. It's good to be able to compare similar products but LP didn't win in this comparison for me."
4,How,"I am a student at Michigan State university. I some how got a stray email about his 'inspirational ' seminars on campus.I was interested to see what my school was spending money on bringing in a speaker. It seemed to be more or less a culture minority thing to me, but he himself was not at all.He was an amazing speaker, and his book is not meant to be ready for its research. "" it is not a book for everyone, it was written only for those who are in the constant pursuit for the best life has to offer"""".....the principles in the book are simple, they are otern neglected and not put to use""I agree with him saying you can find inspiration for any situation when you feel challenged anywhere in thebook. dont read it straight through, just pick it up and open to something.This is only for people who want to be inspired to continue their quest for whatever situation. Not give up"
4,Good flavor. Available at Costco,"Great flavor. Texture can be slightly grainy or crystaline in areas at times, but not so much to be a problem in recommending product. Costco warehouse sells much cheaper @ +/-$11.00/lb."
3,Good for the time,"As the leading civilian authority on the Secret Service, I don't highly recommend this book---for collectors only. It is over 70 years old and, thus, is very dated. In addition, it is very dry reading."
3,Nabakov's Autobiography,"It's well written, but it took real discipline for me to continue reading it. Maybe I'm not interested in lepidoptery, including sticking butterflies with pins. I found the tension level throughout the book to be straight-lined and kept waiting for something to happen. Important political events of his time were merely referred to without much detail or emotional involvement."
4,master of language,"From the first line (""The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness"" ), Nabokov displays his mastery over our language. His depictions of his aristocratic childhood, finding a book bearing the mark of his father's library in a bookshop years later, hunting and mounting butterflies, and synesthesia are all beautifully wrought. Great memoir of his earlier life. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes memoirs or Nabokov or great writing."
2,Cultured Discourse,"In Speak, Memory, Nabokov, who is known for crafting memorable sentences in his novels, attempts to apply his abilities to a story that mirrors all the elegance of the New York telephone directory. And he comes up short.If you open the book to any page, you are likely to recognize his rich writing style:""This final dachshund followed us into exile, and as late as 1930, in a suburb of Prague (where my widowed mother spent her last years on a small pension provided by the Czech government), he could still be seen going for reluctant walks with his mistress, waddling far behind in a huff, tremendously old and furious with his long Czech muzzle of wire - an émigré dog in a patched and ill-fitting coat.""But you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Two stars for effort."
4,A very nice thriller!,"This movie is very good! I love the suspense and the thrills throughout, especially the flashback scenes. Songs are entertaining and good. Asin has given a very nice performance. Aamir, of course, is top class.I enjoyed both the original Tamil and Hindi versions of this flick! Worth a watch on DVD!"
2,Disappointed after all the hype,We purchased this movie after all of our friends and family had told us that we should see it. We also knew that it was the highest selling Bollywood movie ever. We had high expectations.We were very disappointed when we watched it. The story was implausible and unnecessarily violent. The actors did a good job and the music numbers were good but the movie didn't work. It was like a comedy/love story and a violent drama got put together without enough effort made to connect them.
2,Got book--writing all over cover (wasn't in description),I was disappointed that this book had writing all over the cover...there was no warning for that in the description.Otherwise it is fine...just a bit misleading.
4,It fits and works great,"It was easy to fit over my Moto Q and protects the key board and casing. The screen protector is NOT part of the plastic casing. That is a separate item that is packaged with the casing. It was a little tricky, but does a great job too."
2,Circuit Tester,I tried this product and keep getting no reading or false readings. I do not recommend this product.Maybe another model of this company or another brand.
1,Circuit Breaker Finder,"It worked fine the first time I used it but that was it. The next time I tried it.... nothing. I followed all the directions that came with it but there was no response as I moved the detector portion over the circuit breaker panel. Could not tell if it was the unit itself or the plug in part. Tried to locate a ""contact us"" address online but had no luck. I would not recommend spending any money on this item."
5,Conquer Fear Keeps Me Climbing,This is a book worth reading if you want to achieve more in your life. Lisa Jimenez helps you to look at fear in a new light. She assists in helping you gain insight into why you are feeling the fears you do. Lisa exposes the beliefs that don't serve us well. Her step by step plan in finding your life's mission is unique. This book can be read over and over because each time new insights can be gained. I love her honesty and courage.
5,a festive salute to the most mentioned unmentionables,"dr. terri hamilton's research is extensive, full of fun facts to share. a great cocKtail party conversation starter, it will make you giggle while you're getting an education from a well respected educator.her tone is UPlifting and with wit and a wink she takes you on a journey through time with two of man's most precious possessions.enjoy!!!!a read like this comes along only once in a while!"
2,Left me limp!,"After reading reviews from readers on this site I was excited about enlighting my knowledge on the male and female ""goods"", but found myself bored within the first couple of chapters. The so called doc - constantly kills the interest with one liners that leave you yearning for nothing. She desperately tries to appear witty and experienced only to come off as a preformance anxiety filled writer(2-3 stars at best). The physical layout of the book is a desk top publishing nightmare - with the margins so far in on all sides to give minimal words per page, yet streching the length of the book (perhaps an attempt of overconpensation, hehe). This book had huge potential and its a shame a better writer didn't grasp the idea between his/her hands before Hamilton. I'm guessing if you are easily entertained and you've got 20+ bucks to spare, then this would be a good book. Other wise, spend the money on your significant other and learn about the curiosities first hand!"
1,Tempting Mr. Wright,"I have read all of Sue Civil-Brown's books and was looking forward to this one coming out. However, this book was not up to Sue's talents. I very seldom don't finish a book - but I stopped reading this one half-way through. I became so bored with Tess and Jack fighting that I just gave up. Their adolescent behavior was irritating, and they continued to fight long after they should have come to some accord. I found myself not even caring what had happened to their partents. If you're looking for one of Sue's books that are full of off-beat characters and lots of laughs - don't buy this one."
2,Tempting Mr. Wright,This book was awful. Ususally I love Sue Brown's books. I did not enjoy this at all. Very slow and poor story. There are many older books that she has written that are 10 times better. Save your money. Buy a old one.
1,Not Sue Civil-Brown's best,I agree with several of the other reviewers that this is not Sue Civil-Brown's best book. I usually like her romantic comedies but this had no romance and was not funny; it was mostly annoying. The story is very far fetched and disappointing.
1,This is not romance,"I can't tell you how it ends as I threw this book away. Not only are the characters not sympathetic, the entire story could be told in three paragraphs. However, I've finished lame books before. What stopped me with this one? Among the last ten words spoken by our hero before he took the woman to bed for the first time were ""shut your yap"" and ""Tess, shut up."" Then he went into a five page internal conversation wondering how she felt. He didn't ask mind you. He just decided that she would probably want to kill him the next morning for taking her to bed, BUT he just had to go on because he ""had to know what it was like to be with a woman who could move him this way.""Tess, run away. Potential reader, run away. This is not the book to buy."
1,AMEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS,This read like a first attempt at a novel. What a waste of my time and money. Don't be tempted to buy this one. It is so bad.
5,Expand your imagination.,"Wayside School is unlike any school you have ever seen, but the students and teachers are loyal to each other and to their school. This is a real mind expanding, life affirming book and a must read for everyone."
3,Is not as good as the first two,"This book is not as good as the first two, but the first two were so great that it doesn't mean this one is BAD. But Louis Sachar wrote the first two with such originality and zaniness that it is hard, even for him, to live up to those standards. And every story in his first two was so different from the others you didn;t know WHAT to expect.He strays from the normal with this one by focusing on the teachers instead of the students, and that's not as good, because there's not as much you can do with teachers as you can with students. It's still different, and has it's moments, but this is just another example of how sequels can't live up to the original."
3,GREAT BOOK,"This book is great for kids.The characters in the story are great. For example Mrs. Drazil sounds like Brazil, and people made fun of her. Another is Miss. Nogard. She can read people's minds or tell they are thinking. The school sounds real fun. My opinion is that this is a great book. I felt great about reading this book. It opened me up to new places and things.It also gave me a great idea on writing a little story. I would like you to read this book.You will love this book. It is nice for the family to read. Please go to the nearest library or book store and read this book."
5,wayside school,Wayside School gets a little stranger is good for the mine if like schools that are 30 stories high. The book is about a school that is 30 stories high and the students that are in it. Each bokk is 30 stories long and is about Mrs. Jews class. I highly recomend this book.
3,Maxx Comedy,"This is a very funny book! I couldn't put it down! It is a fast reader and is great for someone looking for a laugh! I would recomend it for children under the age of 13 because it has a little amout of kid comedy.Max Cormandy is a child from a slightly poor family who loves to tell jokes at school! His teachers tell him about a comedy contest, sort of like American Idol, and he wants to try out. His mom supports him all the way but in the car on the way to the audition, they encounter manjor problems. You will have to read this book to see if he makes it to the audition on time. This is a very good book and and excelent for the action lover and the comedian in all of us!"
5,Great Book!!,"I'm 20 years old and I loved reading these books as a kid - and I definitely enjoyed reading them as an adult. These stories are a bit silly and child-like, yes, but there's a lot more to them if you really sit down and take the time to think about them."
5,Best book ever!,"Have you ever had the weirdest teachers and a science project with the weirdest things? Because I haven't. At Wayside School the kids have wild adventures and crazy substitute teachers. My favorite character was Louise because he was always funny, but he was sometimes serious. I loved this book because every chapter had something funny in it. So, if you love to laugh and love funny characters this is the book for you."
5,They're Back For Another Sequel!,They're wacky! They're Fun! They're on the 30th story? Yup! Wayside was built up instead of across. Best written book comedy ever! You must have the other two parts to understand this third part. Great story telling
3,"A good book, but not as good as the last one.","First, I would like to say that this book and Wayside School is Falling Down (the last one) are both better than the first one. But Wayside School is Falling Down is better than this one. In this book, the author focuses more on what the TEACHERS are doing, than what the Students are doing. And it is a little more funny when the book focuses more on the kids, because kids are more funny to read about. Not to put this book down, it still had some funny parts, but it just didn't have that something that the last one did.I would recommend getting this book, but just don't expect it to be better than the last one."
1,Cruelty is not funny,"Dear Lizard Face,Guess what? I didn't do my homework again! HA HA AH! And there is nothing you can do about it because you're too stupid and ugly! HA HA HA! My family is moving away tomorrow! And don't know where! HA HA HA! Rub a monkey's tummy! By the time you get this letter, I'll be gone. Rub a monkey's tummy with your head.Love and Kisses,Jane SmithIf you really want your kids to read this kind of joke, you will love this book. The book is full of this kind of meanness and cruelty. Hey, don't get mad, it is supposed to be fun."
5,JUSTICE WILL NOT BE DENIED!!!!,John Wooden has crafted a story for the ages. I just finished this novel and I am giving this book to my 16 year old son to read. The characters are so real you can feel their heartbeat pulse through the book cover! Kenny (KC) Carson is up there with James Patterson's Alex Cross and Robert Ludlam's Jason Bourne! We need more black mystery/suspense writers and Mr. Wooden adds his name to the list with a vengeance!! I look forward to more from this very talented author!!!
4,One woman's sump pump experience,"When I received the pump, it was not assembled. Having no idea what to do, I tried to follow the instructions. They were minimal at best. I am quite satisfied with the pump itself (having finally assembled and tested it) but would recommend better diagrams/instructions/directions. Fortunately, the pump I was replacing was a Wayne SPV 500 so I could try to construct the new one based on the mechanics of the old one. It would also be helpful if this pump were advertised as needing additional parts when ordered. I received the pump and then needed to order hoses and valves separately."
5,Wayne Pedestal Sump Pump SPV-500 Cast Iron,"I'm currently using an SPV-500 in our well-pit to keep the water out of there, and I wouldn't trust any other sump pump brand. I'm on my 3rd Wayne pedestal sump pump in almost 40 years of needing a sump pump. Our original Wayne had the Century motor on it, was first installed back in the early 1970s. Our current one has been an excellent unit, it's very trustworthy, never any problems with switches wearing out, motors burning up or overheating.The bottom line is that the SPV-500 is a workhorse. I have yet to try a 1/2HP SPV-800 but I am sure they are just as reliable and trustworthy.I rate the SPV-500 with 5 stars from personal experience. I won't install any other brand, I'm sold on Wayne sump pumps. They are the best, in my opinion, and if you are looking for a very reliable sump pump, purchase Wayne, or Wayne ReliableOne, from Lowes. Wayne ReliableOne is the same pump, just with the Lowe's Trademark."
1,Failed within 24 hours,"This Chinese-made piece of crap failed on the fourth test after installation. It was tested with clean water and on the fourth try, the motor seized and failed. The product was installed in accordance with all instructions, including the ""optional"" check valve. The lift was only four feet, but the pump can't even handle that load. Wayne used to make solid products, apparently not any more. Do not buy this pump!!"
1,Extremely disappointed,"Just returned this SPV500 pump - failed out of the box. Tested it in 10 gal shopvac tank before installing. Good thing, because it did not discharge any water. Contacted Wayne, we went through their ""standard"" phone tech trouble shooting questions and had nothing to offer other than they were very sorry it didn't work. They would be willing to ""work with me"" on ""fixing"" it, but I couldn't trust this manufacturer. They do not ""wet"" test before shipping and they stated the they could not have installed the imperllor in backwards. Where does one find a dependable sump pump? I would pay twice the amount for a guarateed preformance pump, but Wayne makes all the ""box"" store pumps (re-tagged names), so choices are limited. Suggestions anyone?"
1,not as claimed,"Got my new sump pump this afternoon. We were willing to pay more for Wayne because it was supposed to be made in USA. It is not, it was from China. The box is clearly labled from china, the pump is clearly labeled 'Made In China' in two places. It IS made of iron, but is NOT the heavy casting promised. I already have two non-USA pumps that have failed and flooded my basement. I want USA made and you lied when you said you had it. I'm sending it back. Retruns are somewhat difficult. I would NOT buy from Amazon again. Rating has one star only because rating won't print with the zero stars it deserves"
1,There are better Traditional examples elsewhere.,"Monture taught me his rendition of brain-tanning and 'traditional' beadwork. I have learned authentic Traditional beading not only from Barth's book, ""Native American Beadwork: Traditional Beading Techniques for the Modern-Day Beadworker"", but from working with traditional Native beadworkers and hide tanners. Monture's book is truely a romanticized version of yesteryear surely to captivate the heart of a non-traditional ""indigenous wannabe"". An educated guess; One cannot write about things that one does not know. Nice try anyway."
3,It's worth looking at.,"I just got this book along with two others the other night. Haven't had the chance yet to read it completely yet. Having scanned it a bit though, I would say the section with color photos is good, particularly if you're a crafter looking for patterns. The text I've read up to this point is good and worth reading. I've had a little bit of a hard time with some of the diagarms though, particularly some of the ones dealing with hides and hide tanning. Not that I'm looking to tan hides right now, but I thought it would still be interesting to understand the process. Several of the stitch diagrams are easier to follow though. There are black and white photos as well in this book. Most came out fine, but I think a there are a few that must have had poor lighting."
3,A good start,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" is undoubtley the worst of the Star Trek television series. Each week the characters travel around the unknown regions of the Delta Quadrant on their pristine ship, meet some hard headed aliens, get into some space battles, and move on to next week as if nothing happened. However, the 2-hour premiere is pretty successful in terms of drama and action. There is enough of an action quotient to keep the show entertaining while we are introduced to all the characters and the situation. There is no doubt in my mind that ""Voyager"" was much better in its earlier days. Some of these episodes are worth seeing, such as this one. But when considering the direction the series has taken, I'm not sure its really worth it. Still, ""Caretaker"" is interesting and entertaining. The only making my ranking of the video lower is what comes a few seasons down the line..."
1,IF NOT FOR THE COURAGE OF THE FEARLESS CREW...,"The absolute low point (to date, that is), of the STAR TREK franchise, VOYAGER is nothing more than Gilligan's Island in space. Unfortunately, they forgot to bring along Ginger and Mary-Ann..."
1,"SAME as the Adult Version, TWICE the price","I was happy to find these, seems like a good company with quality fish oils, and with all 3 omegas for kids, that's tough to find. But check out the adult caps. Both the adult and kids caps are about the same price, with a dose being two caps for both. Here's the rub: The adult dose is EXACTLY TWICE that of the junior.So if you just give your child one of those caps, you get the EXACT SAME DOSE as two of the kids caps. And remember, same price for 180 caps. Give your child two of the juniors, or one of the adults.It's basically a marketing rip of here. You're paying TWO TIMES for the exact same lemon-flavored omegas. This really irritates me, so I checked the labels for other kids and adult comparisons. Same thing.While this in no way detracts from the product's integrity, it DOES detract from the company's integrity. So I will most likely not be buying again.Also, it does not not not taste like a lemon drop."
2,How to get them down?,"My 7-year-old won't swallow these and gagged when he tried to chew them. The only way I can get the supplement into him is to surreptitiously squirt the contents into something else he will eat that will mask the fishiness, lemon flavoring notwithstanding. I'd appreciate any suggestions from other users."
1,"It worked great, at least for the first four months.","It worked wonderfully for the first four months. And then it quit reading Minidiscs. Hey, it's under warranty for a year, right? So I sent it in.They got back to me a month later and said they'd fix it for $76. That's almost half the cost of a new one! I've had this thing for four months! Isn't it under warranty for a year? Well, the parts are under warranty for a year - but the labor for only three months. I said no way. They said they could cut me a break and charge me only $50. Wait, so this is negotiable now? Why don't you just fix it for free, considering it cost $200 and didn't last even six months?They said they'd pay the return postage to send it back to me with a customer service comment card. Wow, incredible.Screw Sony. This company deserves to tank.P.S. They just pulled any future development for the HD format."
3,DON'T LET THE THREE STARS TURN YOU OFF>>>READ MORE>>>,"I just got my player yesterday, so I can not give a fair review, as I've not had the time to test everyting out yet, so please don't let the 3 stars scare you off. I really love this player, actually, I just need time to let it earn its 5 stars, if it will. So far the player is very intuitive. The sound is good. I love Hi-MD, now, in addition to standard MD. Recording onto it is easy enough. I must say, too, that sonicstage is not bad so far, despite what other reviewers have written. That's my twopence about the matter. Anyway, I'll give another review in about 6 months to a year if I remember...hehehe. But good so far. LONG LIVE MINIDISC!!! DOWN WITH THE EVIL EMPIRE ADORNED WITH GLOSSY WHITE EARPHONES!!!"
2,"Good for recording, bad for anything else","The SonicStage software is terrible, and you can't use anything else to download music to the device. It's slow, it hangs, and it wastes a lot of harddrive space converting everything."
2,I cannot believe the software doesn't support Macintosh!!,"I am very disappointed. It is unbelievable that the software is not compatible with Mac. When I bought it I didn't even think that could happen, most of the musicians I know have a Mac. What were they thinking?"
4,"great, but interface is weak","This is slightly awkward to use - the ipod interface puts it to shame. Small buttons, and multi-step processes for getting around the functions. BUT, it is much more flexible. Getting CD's into it is much faster and easier than with the ipod, and it has infinite storage capacity and a choice of fidelities. It is great for a musician - I use it to record concerts and rehearsals with excellent results. If you are technically adept, it is a the superior format for mp3 stuff, recording, portable data storage etc.The battery life is fine for play back - longer than ipod. For recording, it consumes less power with the old MD's rather than the new gig md's (same fidelity choices, just less space on the older ones)."
1,Piece of junk,"The battery is so poor, I wonder if it may infact be defective. The user interface is awkward, clumsy and hard to use. And then after 5 months of usage, the thing finally broke completely. waste of money. stay away."
2,not back or mac compatible,"This is theoretically a great device, except ... I use macs, so much of what it can do, I can't use it for. I knew that and was perfectly happy to buy a replacement for my old one to record live music. Unfortunately, this is a new recording technology that is incompatible with my other minidisc recorder. This one can play my old minidiscs, but I can't play the new hi-mds on my old one. All I get is an annoying beep. You can record in the old mode with a computer (non-mac), but why wouldn't you just record on your computer then? As many reviewers have pointed out, this product can't compete with the i-pod, and shouldn't try. Sony messed up a good product."
4,MZ-RH910 Hi-MD,"This model is being discontinued. My understanding is that the model superceding this one has a lit display, which would be a real improvement. The instructions that came with the recorder are not great, but not bad. I bought the recorder primarily for recording our albums on vinyl and on magnetic tape and converting them to audio CDs. It's working very well for that purpose. I have not tried recording with a microphone. The ear buds that came with the recorder are not comfortable for me, but they are adequate for listening to the albums as they're being recorded, so I can add track marks. I guess my principal complaint would be that neither the recorder operation nor the software operation are very intuitive for me."
2,A disappointed fan,"Tigana, The Fionavar Tapestry and A Song for Arbonne are among my favorite books. The Lions of Al-Rassan was a disappointment, and this one is far worse. It has none of the heart-wrenching drama that made his prior work so unique."
2,Not up to Kay's usual standards,"Although Kay is my favorite author, and I find myself happily re-reading his previous novels every so often, this one did not live up to Kay's usual promise. The characters lack depth, the rich symbolism I usually enjoy in Kay's works is given only a passing nod and the story only really begins towards the end of the book. Alhtough I realize there will be a sequel, there is certainly no sense of closure to this volume."
4,"Sailing to Sarantium, in stores now!","A wonder to read, Sailing to Sarantium is a wonderful continuation in the world of ""The Lion's of Alrassan"", A glorious book from a brillant author."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I read ""The Fionivar Tapestry"" by this author, and thoroughly enjoyed it, so was looking forward to reading this set of books. Although the books are very well written, they are not fantasy! I do not think you can call a set of books fantasy if all the author does is stick two moons in the sky (or whatever). He obviously wanted to write about the Roman Empire without having to stick to any history or facts. Fine, but these books are not fantasy. Also, ""Sailing to Sarantium"" is quite dull. I have not been able to summon up enough interest to finish the second book, and I am usually a fanatic about finishing a book series. The author obviously has things to say about life and art, but darned if I can figure out what they are."
2,Disappointed,I love Kay. I did not love this book. I was bored with almost everything. I hope the next half is better.
2,Sailing to Sarantium,My 2 star review probably comes from the fact that I'm not a huge fantasy fan. A fantasy book really needs to be wonderfully written with a driving narrative for me to enjoy it. I think the Patrick Rothfuss Name of the Wind series is great as was Game of Thrones.Sailing to Sarantium never caught fire for me - it had an uninteresting hero with a rambling tale that I found hard to finish.I read all the reviews from readers who loved the series before purchasing the book - they must understand a lot more about what makes a fantasy book good than I do - I put it on my pile to go to GoodWill - I won't even lend it to friends or relatives looking for a good read. Thus the 2 star rating.
3,Boldly going where Kay has never gone before . . .,"This book suffers from being the first part of a series, but Kay continues to deliver in his explorations of artists relating to their work. Further, this book covers spiritual matters in a sophisticated manner that he has never touched on. The problem with the book - I hate ones that don't have appropriate endings. Two major secondary characters finish their storyline with minor plot points (Kasia goes shopping ala pretty woman, and Vargos gets to play hard-boiled detective). The other big problem -- the cover is dreary and uninteresting. This isn't Kay's fault, it's the publishers, but it sure wouldn't entice me to pick the book up if I were browsing."
3,Gets off to a slow start,"I'm a longtime fan of Kay's work, and I went into this book expecting a lot. I almost put the book down after the first thirty-five pages: the extended scene-setting at the beginning turns out to be important in later chapters, (and in the sequel) but it moves at a glacial pace.Keep reading! The scenes in the Aldwood are among Kay's best work, and the end of this volume is outstanding. Have the sequel handy when you're through."
4,Another brillantly written novel.,"Once again, Guy Kay has given us a masterful novel, managing (unlike so many of his contemporaries) to wed great writing with a powerful story. Unlike his two best novels, Tigana and Song for Arbonne, the setting of this novel is more historically nuanced, a change which points to Kay's maturity as an author. But, he still communicates the heart of his cast of characters. The incident with the god in the forest stayed with me for several days afterwards, it was so profound and mysterious.My only complaint: what's with the man on the cover? What happened to the distinctive Kay cover art, which never indulged in such a romance-novel look?"
5,Very sound vocal philosophy,"This is the first book on voice that I ever read. That was several years ago and I still love it. It's more philosophical than it is technical but Marafioti's principles of voice are sound, and both educational and inspirational. It's a good book for the serious student of voice to read."
2,Dull and out of date but useful for reference details,"Conyers Read's work is a very thorough biography of the life of Sir Francis Walsingham (1532 -1590).Walsingham's life was of riveting interest (politics, espionage, war, exploration). Read misses some areas of this because of changing historical styles, and the availability of a wider range of sources.However the primary problem is his absolute lack of nuance in approaching the subject; the book lacks real insight, and is very blind to the politics and factional manoeuvrings of Elizabeth's court. He also underrates the sophistication and professionalism of the people he is studying.He is very useful for his thorough reading of the main English sources for the period and his efficient citation of them.Mitchell Leimon MA (Glasg) PhD (Cantab)"
4,A slim volume that packs a lot of punch,"This book manages to get the essentials of the Craft across very well, in a totally understandable way. It offers good advice, explains the different traditions and recommends well chosen further reading. With it's exercises at the end of each chapter it's a great way to start exploring Witchcraft for yourself before going on to read more indepth books."
3,semi-cover,"This is a nice enough song, but doesn't anyone recognise it as a semi-cover of Hall and Oates 'I can't go for that'.Same music and the female singer even sings the lines of the first verse!"
4,Simply Red is back with much thanks to Hall & Oates!,I have always loved the original - I Can't Go For That by Hall & Oates. It's a natural progression that I would then love Simply Red's take on the classic with SUNRISE. I heard this song first in Europe where it was a massive hit! It's featured prominently in the film IT WAS ALWAYS ME and while we have to wait for the movie soundtrack here - we can cherish the first song from the movie!
4,Agree with A music fan from California,"I have this CD also and I have to say the best part is the original version. The mixes are a little too traditional. I still gave this CD a high rating because I really liked the original version and because this CD contains the video and making of the video footage. If you collect videos you may want to get this one. It was shot in Brazil with beautiful, sexy people surrounding a pool."
1,Trash!!!!,Don't waste your money. This piece of junk fell off my keychain and there was no way I could repair it. Very poor quality.
4,Good But Not My Favorite of Theirs,"You can never really go wrong with a Mermen album, but this one is probably not their most approachable. ""Food for Other Fish"" is less surf and more rock with the same amount of psychedelia. Personally I find myself listening to ""Krill Slippin"" more, a lot more."
5,Awesome,"Daughter loves it would deal with them again. Very nice and easy to deal with, no need for follow up."
2,Wrong item for my car,"I order it on the vendor's site and it supposed to fit on my 1982 Tercel. Worry about that, order it for nothing...."
5,This Bell tolls for you,"""Everybody loves a winner"" and ""Eloise"" are just two standouts on this great comp by also-ran soul crooner William Bell. Fans of Don Covay, James Carr, OV Wright, et al. should take special note. Not growly or fierce like them, but great songs and delivery. Sort of like Joe Tex without the perpetual GRIN throughout, more melancholy and heartfelt. Beautiful soul classic."
4,Click on; Give A Listen to Heartfelt Tunes,"William Bell never really hit the big time; his biggest hit was ""You Don't Miss Your Water"" in 1961. I can't be sure the one on this package is even the original of that one but it matters not. These sparse lean recordings come from a very special place in time. They deserve a listen; in fact, anything with the name ""Stax"" on it should not be ignored."
1,Lowrance iWay 600C GPS,"Thank you for your business, recently I purcharsed 2 GPS by mistake, and returned one, I have to pay for almost 20% restock fee, and I have an exprience with you on behave of communication, by email, and telephone, can't get the support. Therefor, I just want to let you know I wasn't happy with your serices."
2,iWay 600C - software issues,"Although the size of the unit is large. The extra screen size allows for easy viewing. Point-to-point navigation is nice for family trips to answer the proverbial question (""When are we going to get there?). I bought the unit for the flexibility to transfer usage from the car to the boat. Suprisingly, intercoastal bouys are included as I am not a lake boater. However, the unit had some sort of software issues - the screen would freeze and be non-responsive and there were a couple of visual presentation problems. I had to send it back. For the dual use, there aren't many choices in this price range. You could spend hundreds more on a Garmin and the added marine cards."
1,"Good in some features, lacking in others","The touch screen is very, very tempermental! Sometimes it works, sometimes you have to hit the screen multiple times. The mp3 player is horrible! Sometimes it plays through the radio ok, other time all you can hear is some scratching sounds. I will send it back to the factory for adjustment. I hope they fix it or replace it. I will never, ever buy a Lowrance product again!!!"
3,Intruguing but Difficult,"Back in the 1920s, anthropologist Margaret Murray studied the records of witch trials and concluded that the witches of Western Europe were actually maintaining a pagan religion that dated back to Neolithic times. Its chief concern was to promote fertility, whether of crops, animals, or people; and in the minds of its practitioners, the central deity of their devotions was the highest possible god of goodness, rather than an agent of evil. I'm not sure if any of this is still reputable anthropology, but the book's theme of cult survivals is noteworthy for having inspired 20th century horror authors such as H. P. Lovecraft. Unfortunately, much of the book consists of testimony quoted directly from trial records, in the original languages, with no translation. For a more accessible account of Murray's theories, see her 1931 work, The God of the Witches."
3,Fair for the beginner,"If you're a brand new lace maker, this should be a fairly good set of patterns. This is, however, a WORKBOOK, not a book: it is not bound in any way; it is only 9 loose legal-size pages of pictures and patterns, with a few pieces of cardstock on which to make your prickings. There are 18 patterns ranging from narrow and simple to a bit more complex. There are absolutely no instructions included, so a companion book of how to make lace would be a must. This is probably not a good investment for the more experienced lace maker, only a fair set of patterns for the price, and one could most likely do better to find patterns with stitches and instructions in a fully-bound book."
3,Works great after some tuning......,"I would have expected the factory set-up to be better. The blades were not parallel to the base, so I reset the blades with the jig. After resetting the blades (3 times with the same result), I found the jig set the blades 0.015"" higher than the rear shoe, hence it would dig in at the end on the board. I had to compensate by shimming under the front of the rear shoe. Works great now.P.S. The bonus bag is sweet...it's even big enough for my circular saw."
4,Good but hard to set,"I like this tool but as previously said the jig to set the blades is off. This is critical as is any planer. My planer blades were about 0.5 mm off, above the rear plate,causing snipe at the exit of the cut even with pressure on the rear part of the handle. Rather than shimming the plate ,I chose to adjust the jig. The plastic is cast and is not true.I used a digital caliper and machinist square to mill the plastic base(use sand paper on a glass plate or even the rear plate of the planer) and stop and thru trial and error I was able to get the level correct. The jig setting is too long so the blades mount high with respect to the rear plate. This is an important adjustment and Makita did not do a good job on this.I also have a hard time with the hard case in trying to fit everything in it."
5,This book belongs in every home,"I bought the book after hearing the author interviewed recently on WGN radio. You know how everyone tells you to write down your questions before going to the doctor. I always mean to, but I usually end up ""winging it."" Here you can just grab the book, bookmark the page that deals with your particular condition and bring it to the doctor's office. There's usually time in the waiting room to read through the recommended questions in the book and even make notes in the margins. I think it's a great tool to have around when medical situations come up."
1,Not at all what I expected...,"This book offers a list of questions for ~65 situations, only one of which I found suitable for the elderly person I bought it for. She is very intimidated by doctors and other med staff, so I was hoping the book would give her the ability to overcome that, acknowledge her concerns, give direction in how to compile questions to ask, and realize that we're in a time where the patient has to be very proactive to get things done. Since she wouldn't have questions on 95% of the topics (like acne, ADHD, scarlet fever), the book isn't worth the money paid. I would have returned it, but couldn't find the receipt."
2,Disappointing,"""Beggars Ride"" is both the shortest and the least satisfying book in Ms. Kress' ""Beggars"" series. From the standpoint of construction, the book has a number of contrived plot devices. I can't go into those without giving away parts of the story. Suffice it to say, they will be obvious to most readers. The author introduces one appealing new character who overcomes her psychological and emotional difficulties through force of will. In her earlier books, Ms. Kress explored the impact of both real and perceived psychological differences on groups of people. The message from this book seems to be that you can will away shortcomings and change your neural function at the same time. Had the first book of the series been of the quality of ""Beggars Ride"", I certainly would not have gone further. This was a disappointing end to an otherwise powerful exploration of social inclusion, exclusion, and discrimination."
3,Disappointing,"I loved Beggars in Spain and have read it and the sequel, Beggars and Choosers, many times. However, this novel is a bad ending to the trilogy, mainly perhaps because my favorite character, Leisha Camden, was killed off in the second novel. Most of the characters are two-dimensional and unlikable, except for Lizzy, a throwback genius Liver who is doomed to a welfare existence."
2,Disappointing,Disappointing. Looks like she was trying to wrap up the trilogy without putting too much effort into it. It lacked much of the depth and richness of her previous books.
5,What can be said that hasn't? The liner notes are not good,"Yeah, yeah, I am sweating the small details here. However, there is no way any one human can be expected to understand all of the languages spoken on this CD, certainly at least a song name translation to english would have been nice.The fact I am upset about this should only tell you how much I want to know about the amazing music in this CD. The arrangements are absolutely incredible and having some instrumental variety, each well suited for the voice of the vocalist singing."
4,Lipking focuses on Johnson's writing rather than the life.,"Lipking has written a ""writer's life,"" examining Johnson not from the viewpoint of celebrity, but as a history of his writing, and ""career development"" as an author. Lipking's thesis is that the transformations Johnson underwent in his career went a long way in shaping what we think of authors, and in that interest spends the bulk of his time examining Johnson's written words. While one may initially think this approach is redundant with Kernan's (""Samuel Johnson and the Impact of Print""), in fact Lipking is far less concerned with the publishing industry and more concerned with Johnson's writings themselves. A more direct comparison might be made to DeMaria's ""Samuel Johnson,"" but even there the comparison is weak. Like Lipking, DeMaria analyzes Johnson's writings, but Lipking is less concerned about context, and concentrates far more on the writings."
2,Not Quite,The book talks about doing things then states you will find it in another chapter. Its a bit confusing.. maybe it would help if I knew the terminoligy.
3,WordPerfect 12 for Dummies,The book is very helpful and was in excellent condition when I received it. I am most pleased at how quickly I received my order. I would highly recommend this seller to others.
1,Does not cover macros,"I purchased this book specifically to look at advanced macro command codes. There is NO mention of macros at all. Not in the table of contents, index, or otherwise. Incredibly disappointing."
5,Word Perfect 12 for Dummies Regview,"Took a long time to come, but now that I have it, it will be very useful."
5,My favorite book,I received a copy of this book for my 1st Communion in 1977. I still have the book and have given copies as gifts many times over the years.
3,To small,"I have a large head and this one is way to small. I feel it is made for a youth. not a grown man. I plan on giving it to my Grandson and it will fit him perfect. It is a nice hat, don't get me wrong. Appears to be high quality. Time will tell."
3,Not the right color,"I was under the impression it was going to be in navy, yet it came in black. It was not the color I wanted. Dislike."
5,vinyl records,this 45 you should have in your collection . sundazed put this out with the sleeve to look like the original columbia lable .
5,TAINT NO BIG THING,"I THINK THIS IS JIMMY'S BEST LP! THE SONGS MARY, MARY AND THERE'LL BE A DAY ARE WHAT YOU CALL REAL BLUES! MY DAD USED TO PUT THEM ON 45'S, AND I WAS SMALL BUT I REMEMBER HOW GREAT THEY WERE, AND NOW I'M HOOKED ON JIMMY REED! THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LP ON CD!"
3,"A good book, twenty years ago","With Cramster.com now, this book proved to me little more than worthless...Just like with many higher level courses, repeating problems are the best way to learn the material, but with a full schedule, it is better just to see the exact problems that are in your textbook..."
5,Excellent,The book was in excellent condition and I received the delivery well before the expected date.
5,clear information,This book has lots of clear information in an understandable format. There are a lot of examples of problems and their solutions.
5,I would NEVER buy anything else!! The sound is perfect,"25 foot long, THX certified, around 30 bucks to my door in just a few days. Yah, to say the least, I am one satisfied customer"
5,Great Price Great Product,This cable rocks. Increased the SQ and SPL of my cheap little Sony sub-woofer significantly. Would absolutely recommend this to others. Very flexible cable too!
4,A long tradition - and still works well,"The air here in Baghdad is hot, dry and dirty. I was having a lot of problems with keeping it styled at all. On a hunch, I bought this and it works very well to keep your hair neat. Time will tell if its the right solution."
2,Black Violin,"Basically everything in the product information is true. But, pegs do have an excessive tendency to slip out of thir holes. It is nice that the rosin is included, but it would better if they peg drops were included too since the pegs seem to be so loose. Also, I ordered a black violin but the wood on the other side of the fingerboard is unpainted. Buyer beware: they state that the bridge is ""easy"" to install, but unless you've memorized the anatomy of a violin it can be very confusing. I panicked b/c I couldn't figure out if they strings went thru the holes first then the notches. It turns out you simply slide the bridge under the strings and place it upright, propping it up under the strings, and lining up the strings with the notches on top. Also, the curved side goes up. Maybe this isn't a problem for people who already play violin, but for an absolute beginner like me it was complicated, and this is supposed to be a good violin for beginners."
3,It's not the best and it's not the worst.,"I got mine and I do like it. I'm trying to teach myself how to play and I know that this isn't the best. But, I'd much rather spend 30 than 100 dollars on a instrument that I'm new at learning. The bad thing about it that you need to tune it a lot. (I think that's the case with most though) the good news is that it came in great condition and I do enjoy playing it."
3,To Be Honest,"I guessed i should have seen it coming when i paid 45 for a violin. i open the case and its got wood shards in the case, cant seem to figure out where it came from. the bridge needs to be replaced, and a cheap velcro strap holds it in the case, other than that, the case is very firm, the paint job wasn't impressive at all. the bow is nice, and it did not come with a receipt.for a practice or starting to learn.. probably good, but i've been playing music for 8 years (guitar) and i wasn't too impressed, but i've always wanted to learn..so..Thanks"
5,Black violin,"Beautiful violin. My granddaughter loves it! Very elegant looking. This was her favorite Christmas gift, and watching her face light up with joy was our wonderful reward. Perfect!"
1,extremely poor quality,I gave this violin 1 star because it is more of a decoration than an instrument. I would have returned it if shipping was free. Wont tune & everything is loose. Spend the extra money if you want to actually play it.
1,sprayer sucks,cannot say how well this product actually works since it came with a defective sprayer. I have to go to the store and buy another spray bottle to transfer the contents to. Monsanto sucks.
3,Won't Buy Again,"I have always used Roundup ""extended control"" but I saw this on sale. I don't like it. This does not come close to Roundup's extended control product. This is just like any other cheap weed killer."
1,Awful Awful Awful,"I read the other review that said there was no nudity. So I figured it was attractive ladies and fun music, etc. Well, there was no nudity, but this was the WORST excuse for a video I have EVER seen. It is nothing but a substandard hip hop video switching off between guys making dumb comments and girls acting like bimbos, and as for the music, it was often garbled and unintelligible anyway. I decided to stream it first... I recommend you do the same, this is a complete waste of plastic. Pity the fool who bought the DVD before previewing it through Amazon instant video first."
4,reckoning,"very nice watch, not too heavy, gets comments, digital ticks pretty cool, nice band, comfortable. fair dinkum if you want a nice everyday watch"
1,Smells HORRIBLE!!,My husband used this to clean the carpet in my car almost 2 weeks ago and the car smells beyond HORRIBLE! Definitely like barf and definitely disgusting. Will never use again!
1,BEWARE! Smells like vomit!,Bought this product to clean pet stain on carpet. it got rid of the pee smell and left me with a even worse vomit smell! its so strong that is all anyone ever notices when they come near the carpet. may need to trow away the rug if no solution is found to remove this horrible smell caused by this product!
1,don't like,i bought his video. my nephew doesn't like it. he won't watch it and the songs are all sung diffrently from how i grew up learning them. there should be a standard for kids songs. so that there is some consistancy.
5,Totally Cheesy...but the kids love it!,This video is so cheesy but for some reason my 15 month old twins love it. They will sit through the whole thing staring or dancing. I really can't understand why...haha. It mostly has real scenes of people and kids singing and jumpin around and in between here and there are short scenes of I guess the Baby Genius characters that pop in and out. They seem to like all of it. I first bought this for them when they were 11 months and they didn't seem interested at all and of course neither was I. Then at 14 months I got it out and they were mesmerized. My twins give it 5 stars.
5,Wonderful experience for the kids,"I bought this DVD for my daughter when she was born, 4 years ago. She has watched it since then and lately it began to skip, so I bought another copy. Now my 2 and 4 year old watch this everyday and sing and dance to the songs. Even our dog runs around with them and plays! I love Baby Genius products, wonderful for the kids, and it reminds me of my childhood, when I used to sing the same songs!"
2,Not Good,"It is not as good as nursery rhythm. All kids in my family love nursery rhythm, but would not like to sit for this DVD."
4,Get the Nursery Rhymes DVD first,"This is a cute DVD but not as good as the Baby Genuius Nursery Rhymes DVD. First of all I don't think these songs are FAVORITE CHILDREN'S SONGS. The list includes ""take me out to the ballgame"" and ""yankee doodle dandy"". I think some of the songs are good, but they should have had Children's songs for young children, since this DVD is definite geared towards younger children. ""Sing, Dance and Play"" - sort of the BG theme song is done nicely. My granddaughter is a year old - loves the Nursery Rhymes DVD and watches this one - it's just not as good. But it's still entertaining for your child."
1,REVISION OF HISTORY,ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO CAUSE CONFLICT AND REDRAW THE MAP OF THE BALKANS.. ONE SIMPLE QUESTION FOR ALL WHO DOUBT AND ANCIENT MACEDONIANS WERE GREEK. HOW IS IT ARISTOTLE THE TUTOR OF ALEXANDER IS UNQUESTIONABLY GREEK AND ALEXANDER IS NOT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH MACEDONIANS? SAVE THE PROPAGANDA AND THE REVISIONIST LIES.......
1,WHAT?,"yeah right...we have writers claiming that a nation that worshipedgreek(hellenic)gods...people that beared greek(hellenic)names...(Alexander,Cleopatra,Philipos,Pausanias...)people who spoke hellenicPeople that participated in Olympic games...and last but not least gave a name to a great period inhistory(gee...I think the name is hellenistic)were not hellenes but another nation (slavic maybe...)Woh! I was enlighted reading this book!good job...one more thing...People can claim anything...as long as somebody guides him..."
4,A wonderful lesson in history,I have recommended this book to many community members as a good read for understanding how history is written from different points of view and how facts can be mis-represented sometimes. The book tells of historical and factual accounts of the real Macedonians.
3,Precient procedural plotless,"Though copyright in 2003, it's as if the author had already seen yesterday's (13 Aug 2008) headline: ""Attorney General Michael Mukasey confirmed plans Wednesday to loosen post-Watergate restrictions on the FBI's national security and criminal investigations, saying the changes were necessary to improve the bureau's ability to detect terrorists.""So how bad could things get? After all, the FBI is the agency that spotted the 9/11 terrorists months before and then were told to drop their investigation. An FBI procedural that shows us the inner workings is rare indeed, and Riechl is to be congratulated. His flawed hero, neither all good, nor all bad is believeable. But when we finally find out what the bad guy is up to on p260, my response was to say, ""so, that would never work,"" and put the book down. Besides, in real life, the bad guys win."
1,Doesnt make the grade.,"I found this story to be arrogant and unrealistic. If FBI personnel are really this vain and flawed, we are in big trouble. Considering the hero is supposed to be a ranking FBI investigator, he takes time out from his high priority job to gamble away 11 thousand dollars which would have paid for his father's rest home bill. He is so proud of his ability to deceive people he brags about it. As a hobby, he practices lying on polygraphs. This novel is written with arrogance and insults the intelligence of the reader. My library is full of good authors like John Sandford, Stuart Woods, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, John Grisham, Robert B Parker, Elmore Leonard, P.T. Deutermann, Stephen Hunter , etc. But Mr. Riehl will simply never make the grade."
4,Insiders View of the FBI,"Talk about your bad days. Special Agent Puller Monk has a gambling problem, a money problem, a woman problem and then people start trying to kill him. SA Monk and his FBI partner Lisa Sands get involved in the background investigation for the first African American woman nominated to the Supreme Court, Brenda Thompson.What they assumed to be a case mired in paperwork turns out to be full of murder, mayhem and betrayal when they find a discrepancy in her past. Monk and Sands wind up gambling with their lives as the stakes get higher and higher.This book is a fast paced and plot driven, and makes the FBI world very real on the page. Riehl makes excellent use of his background as an ex-FBI agent and makes this book more interesting than most of its kind."
3,A Start,Interesting weaknesses help introduce a new protagonist in this work by a former FBI agent. The bad guys are not what holds our interest this time. Insider insight does. Let's see what the next entry holds.
4,Riehl shows a good deal of promise...,"When I read Michael Connelly's endorsement of this book (and saw it wasn't a typical blurb, but actually a true respect for Riehl), I knew I would like Quantico Rules. It is a very solid first thriller. Monk is a terrific lead (and flawed!). Lisa is fairly well drawn. The other characters are bit two dimensional, but they aren't that vital. I would have liked more intrigue (political) and less action, but overall a quick and intelligent read. The series shows promise, if this book is a bit thin in some areas."
4,"Fast, Furious, and Fabulous","If you like thrillers, Gene Riehl's QUANTICO RULES is a MUST read. The pace is fast, the characters are memorable, and the inside peak at the special FBI unit intriguing. I've not read anything else by Riehl, but I will now. In the end there is no better recommendation than saying, ""I can't wait to read the next book."""
1,Not Very Helpful,"This guide book is pretentious and impractical. For example, really nothing but ""woody"" or ""gritty"" small botique hotels.Really? That's all he can recommend. And his walks and restaurants are the same."
4,"If you love Rick Steves Books, you'll love this","If you love Rick Steves writing style with insider info, hand drawn maps (which drive me up the wall - why can't he have ""regular"" maps?), walking guides (which I love), and the like, you'll love this book. If you don't like his style (few are ambivalent - people seem to either love or hate his books), you probably won't like this one either. This one is straight out of the ""Rick Steves"" mold. 75% of the book is on Amsterdam with the rest on the two cities in Belgium, Brussels and Bruges. Not a lot here on anything else (which you shouldn't expect, given the title!) We bought this book along with the ""standards"" (Frommer's, Eyewitness, etc) to prep for an upcoming trip. Why do people spend $3-4 thousand on a trip yet cringe at spending $100 or so on books that can double the pleasure and depth of their experience? I like much of what is in Steves' books but always use the others to ""round them out."""
3,Great for the limited scope it covers,"Rick and team do their consistently good job in helping with travel in the 3 cities covered. However, if you want to see anything else in Belgium you will need to purchase an additional travel book. I hope that in the future they will decide to include Antwerp, Gent and other areas. It seems they could at least indicate how to do other areas as day-trips from the major cities since the train system makes it easy to get there."
2,Very limited,"Too few maps, poor scale, no street finder. Very few hotels covered, the same for restaurants. There are a few basics covered. This edition appears to be two years old."
4,Thanks Rick,"Rick led us to some of the nicest places in Brugge. I didn't get to experience Amsterdam (which claims about half the pages in the book), but the information on Belgium and Brugge was great. He has some really excellent B&B recommendations. If you end up in Brugge, definitely go see Scottish Maggie :)"
5,"Rick Steves' Amsterdam, Bruges and Brussels","An accurate and clear description of effective and well illustrated travel information getting through Amsterdam, Bruges and Brussels,whether novice or experienced traveler. Excellent presentation of museums and collateral side trips to nearby cities. Succinct historical and current information. A practical common sense guide that mirrors the entire series of travel books Steves' has published."
5,Great guide,"I really like the way this book is laid out and how easy it is to use. It goes by areas of towns and groups needed amenities under those areas, making it easy. There is so much information that it's like a course on the country. I highly recommend this book to you well before your trip so that you have time to go through and become familiar with it!"
2,Not up to the usual high standard,"I have used Rick Steves' books for prior trips to Spain and France, and found them incredibly helpful and informative. This one, however, was slim on information. One example is the scarcity of restaurant recommendations in Amsterdam. This one missed the mark."
2,An elementary primer,"This book covers the basics of Arthurian legend and has many pictures. While it may be a book that young people (9 - 14) might enjoy, it has little to offer anyone who has more than cursory knowledge of Arthurian history, legend and literature."
2,BiblioBazaar version does not have color illustrations!,"Amazon mistakenly lists the publisher name as 'BiblioLife', whereas the actual book I received has 'BiblioBazaar'.In any case, buyer beware that the BiblioBazaar version of THOUGHT FORMS only has black & white illustrations! The website description does not say that the pictures herein are black & white rather that color, and yet they have the audacity to charge $22 for this book! Instead, I advise customers to get the version published by Quest, which has the original color illustrations.UPDATE: July 7, 2012Color illustrations are essential for reading this book, so don't even waste your time getting the current Kindle version which is a free public domain book without the original color plates."
2,Not a good reproduction,"This book is a black and white reproduction, which does not convey the meaning of the colors that is in the original. Also, it costs more than the earlier edition. I recommend not buying this book, and getting the earlier paperback edition instead."
4,Mindblowing,"The content of this book is absolutely mind blowing and i would say its a must read for anyone interested in knowing the real power of thoughts.I gave it 4 stars because there are no pictures. I woud love to own a copy of this book with the images even if i have to pay for it, Its a little difficult to visualize all the thought forms."
5,smart little book,smart little short beautiful book that i expected to be a nice read but didn't expect for a great time reading it. Fast delivery as well
2,Photocopy of original with penciled notes,"The book had a nice binding, but I was sad to see a photocopied book that had notes written on the pages. The notes were references to other parts of the book such as images or previous chapters, but it gave me a sense that this was someone's copy rather than a copy ready to share."
1,Beware the Dodo Press Illustrated Edition,"This is a black & white edition: it does NOT include the color plates of older editions. Without color, it is impossible to appreciate the formulations of the thought-forms. Buy an older edition instead."
1,IndyPublish Doesn't Include Pictures,"Annie Besant generates useful and thought-provoking theosophical books. Thought-Forms is no exception. [...] They excluded the 50 pictures that gave focus and supporting data for the information. So make sure that if you buy a copy of the book it is not from these guys, because you will be disappointed as I was."
4,Review What?,"I would like to have reviewed this album but was unable to do so due to the fact that a listing of the songs was not available in this format; unlike his other album ""Black deuces"". I am searching for a specific song entitled ""Lee's Boogie"" and will gladly purchase this CD if it contains same. Thank You. I may be reached at Walakotah@ftcnet.net CN"
1,Bad Experience,"Never made it, got my money back but left me out in the cold without my product I needed, if they aren't going to stock it and ship it don't advertise it"
5,Great Video - Jiu Joe Jitsu,I would highly recommend this video. This is a no nonsense self-defense instruction that shows you how to defend yourself in many situations.
5,"this is the best shoe I ever had. I love, it's super light and confortable",I have three different pairs of this. It's the best shoe to running or walking around. They have different colors than other brands and you can use with jeans to have a casual style.
3,Some great hard to find songs.,"It took me five years to find a copy of ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"", and then this cd came out, making it available to everyone! It has that song, plus some other hard to find songs such as a live version of ""You Mean so Much to Me"" with Southside Johnny. Another really great tune is ""If I could Walk Away."" While other CD's might have the old Ronettes standards, this CD shows Ronnie as she is today- hard rock, and more current than you can imagine."
1,Already On Watch Band Number Two,I have not had this watch long less than maybe four months but I am already on watch band number two....It looks great in the box but doesn't seem to want to be worn...Being on the go I need to keep track of time and this watch is not suppose to be a pocket watch....
5,The Best Gospel Songs Ever,The reason I like this book so well is because it has some great songs in it that was sang in the church choir I was in for years. They are beautiful songs.
2,Broken upon arrival,"I am at the end of a major remodel and ordered this item three months ago in preparation for its installation. When the builder opened the package yesterday there were two tracks at the bottom that had been spot welded on. Those welds were broken and needed to be repaired by the builder. For the ridiculous expense of this item, you'd think that the craftsmanship would be just a little better. That is what I get for not opening it immediately after receiving it and assuming that it was in good condition."
1,I FEEL LIKE I WAS RIPPED OFF.,"This as other trim kits for Panasonic microwaves cost almost as much as the microwave. I started to look for microwave Oct.8 2012 this kit was $139.75 which I thought was to much. Before I bought the unit and kit Oct.17 the price jumped to $169.95 and the next day Oct. 17, 2012 to over $170. Rip Off!"
1,Isn't there anything better?,"For the riduculous amount of money you'd think they'd at least de-burr the edges and corners of this thing. After installation I found that a slight touch of a corner tears your skin open. Maybe if the corners were cut straight and aligned, there wouldn't be a sharp corner (actually all four corners) sticking out. I had to remove the trim and CAREFULLY file the corners and edges. Garbage production. The manufacturer should be ashamed. I wish I could bill them for my time."
1,Return,"I had to return the product. Amazon was first class, but the problem was with the product description on the website. Not enough technical information, the product did not fit and I could not use it."
3,nice looking frame,"With this trim, my Panasonic microwave looks like a wall-mounted microwave which usually costs more than 1K. The instruction is not very clear though the installation is pretty easy. In general, I'm happy with the purchase.Ont thing to put attention though. The edges are pretty sharp and you could get cut. I filed the corners with the Dremel. It only took a couple minutes."
5,Bought it for my friend,Says he should have bought one ten years ago. He loves it. Awesome features with the magnet and nail set. Best hammer ever used. We nail about 2000-4000 nails a day.
5,Stiletto 10-Ounce Titanium Finish Hammer,This is a really nice hammer! I'd been wanting a light weight finish hammer for some time and I knew Stiletto has always been considered the premier hammer. When in my tool belt my old steel hammer hits me in the knee when in the front holder or bangs around when in the rear holder. This hammer works in either holder and you hardly know it's there. The only negative about this hammer is that it's made in China.
4,work hammer,This is a replacement for the same hammer my husband wore out (and then broke the handle off of.) Great utility hammer.
5,Great Finish Hammer,"I have used it for two days now installing cedar clapboard siding. All hand nailing with SS ring shanks. This hammer is really nice, the light weight makes it almost disappear from the weight of your tool belt but has the hitting power of a steel 16 oz hammer.Update:I have had the hammer for many months now and I still love it. It had held up very well even when using it with nail sets and pry bars."
5,Sark's New Creative Companion,I have a few of Sarks books and have never been disappointed with one of them. What I like is how she helps you lay down alot of your uptight feelings about creating and you feel released to be yourself. I enjoyed reading what other creative women had to say about their experiences. It helped alot.
4,Fun with a lesson,"I have other Sark books, and this year a grandchild who has been reading my books, asked for one of her own for Christmas. This gift was an absolute hit. She loves them. They offer quirky humor and lessons!!"
2,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed the first book in the series, in large part because of its sense of moral ambiguity. There were no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", just people, most of them flawed, trying to live their lives.Then I started reading the rest of the series, and it's a hackneyed series of battles between Good and Evil, interspersed with gratuitous sex scenes. What happened?One thing that happened is that Amazon saw my five-star rating on that first book and keeps trying to get me to buy the rest of the series. Hopefully entering some lower ratings will dissuade it."
3,Merriam-Webster disappoints for once,"This will do if you only use a thesaurus occasionally but it won't do for the rest of us. The usually superlative Merriam-Webster product line missed the beat with this one. Although Roget's is a bit more time consuming to use, it is infinitely more rewarding than this volume. I was very disappointed at the small number of synonyms found for each entry in Merriam. In Roget, you can easily find many words that differ by only the slightest and most subtle shade of meaning. In this book, if it isn't an exact match, you won't know about it. I also saw no point to including antonyms in a thesaurus. I would have preferred many more synonyms included in the space used for antonyms."
5,Best for writing,"When I started writing academic report I was quite worried about how to vary my vocabulary to make my essay more strong and excellent. I bought this Thesaurus and I realized I found what I wanted. It can supply me with sufficient choices of different words for the same meaning. Also, it gives a lot of related word and opposite words which are really beneficial for expanding vocabulary. A essential book working with the Collegiate Dictionary and for academic use!"
5,My son uses this all the time!,"I bough this for my son in High School, and he uses it all the time! He said the other day, that when I gave it to him, he mentally rolled his eyes, but since then he realized how much he uses this book and wanted to thank me! Imagine that, a teenager thanking his Mom for giving him a book.....I was floored!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased both the Thesaurus and the dictionary. Thesaurus helps no more than the dictionary. Could have done without it. Also, I expected to get a book with synonyms and many entries have none. Several words are not even in Thesaurus. Dictionary is much better."
3,errors galore,It is astounding how many errors the authors let slip by. This book's value is limited because of this. You never know if the specifications are right or wrong.
3,Get the Sessler book,"The Sessler book is more accurate and not padded with cooling system capacities and taxable horsepower.Also,Mr. Gunnell, the Korean war ended in 1953, not 1954.The book contains info on obscure prewar engines though."
1,After my last review has not appeared.,"I will try to not be too linguistically provocative this time. But I will still say that this is the worst book I have read in a long long time.This book is primarily set in 1780, one sentence reads ""he always asked the crew for their input"". Hello? Doesn't this woman have an editor? There are no descriptive passages in the book at all - beyond that is the nominal descriptions of the heroine's dresses and ""decolletage"". It could just as well have been set in the present day, with the hero horribly disfigured in a fire or car accident. Colonial Savannah is described not at all. There is no sense of atmosphere or place in this book - all there is is ""her secret passion"" and ""strange yearning"" type of purple prose. How old is this author, 11?This is simply a bodice ripper and not a very good one.If you want passion and pirates and very descriptive writing, I suggest you read ""Birds Of Prey"" by Wilbur Smith."
5,The Best Elvis Collection,"In America, Elvis' record label, RCA, continues to release one bad greatest hits collection after another. 'Greatest Jukebox Hits' and '50 Worldwide Gold Hits' are just plain weird. They don't have many essential songs and include many unnecesary ones. Thank god for the UK. They care enough to do it right. If you want the true Elvis story get this package. All your friends will be asking ""Wow, where did you get this!?!"" This is the best selling Elvis collection in Europe. The Kings Lives (overseas)!!!"
1,Where is caught in a trap,Where is caught in a trap? Elvis's greatest song? Sorry its not an elvis album with out it
3,worth a look,"This is an interesting book and well worth the investment. The only reason I hessitate to give it more than three stars is that the book seems to skip a step here and there, or the illustrations are a bit confusing at times (at least for a beginner like me). Things that make this book worth buying are:layout according to the usage of the knots (ex sailing, camping etc) color coded sections for easy access effect of each knot on rope strength"
4,A Good Knot Book,"This book gives clearly illustrated instructions on tying many very useful knots. It organizes them under headings of Sailing, Hiking and Climbing in which they are most commonly used. The author includes the strength of most of these knots which describes how much they weaken the lines in which they are tied - often leaving less than 50% of the original strength of the line! Some knots do not hold well when bending (you will learn the definition of this term, as well as ""hitch"" and ""knot"") together two ropes of unequal size. Maybe you should use a different knot? Budworth has a suggestion!This book is both useful and interesting thanks to the inclusion of a brief history of each knot. It did not change my life, but it did change how I secure my anchors! I recommend it!"
4,A reasonably helpful basic book,"This is a good beginners book that provides relatively clear instructions. The text is sometimes a bit hard to translate into the actual knot and some of the illustrations are difficult to puzzle out, but overall the book has been very helpful."
3,"Decent Illustrations, Interesting Histories","The book wasn't quite as complete as I had hoped, but the illustrations are good, and the short histories on the knots were interesting. For the price, it was a fine book. Some knots have different names and it seems that there were several repeated knots in the pages of the book. I'm sure this was because of the way the book was organized, but I would rather have had more knots than repeated ones."
4,Best entry-level knot book I've seen.,"I'm terrible with knots; took me forever to get my 2nd Class Scout badge forty odd years ago because of knots! There are more comprehensive and detaild knot books out there and there are even animated knot-tying websites, but this book's combination of good explanations and illustrations worked for me. For someone whose shoes are rarely neatly tied, it enabled me to stand in front of my instructor in my Master's class and tie my eight knots. Now my Sperrys are tied with sheet bends and have rolled back stoppers at the ends of the laces."
1,Pictures are terrible. Waste of money.,I am very disappointed purchasing this book. The illustrations are virtually impossible to follow. There is no logic in the steps following from one point of a knot to another. This book would be better served in a landfill and I will avoid purchasing any other books from this author.
2,The Complete Book of Knots,"This book is good not great, as a Scout Master who has issues tying knots better to use a cheep BSA book or You tube.But just my opinon!"
1,If you are new to knots this book is helpful,"I was new to knots so I found this book rather entertaining, it is not too technical nor too complex, neither too large. It indicates the use of the knots so it comes kinda handy. I think I am ready for next-level knots (more elaborated)."
3,mouse review,"Cute watch. Looked exactly as advertised. However, after 3 month the battery is dead. I have not even bothered to replace the battery, since I have learned from other watches that changing the battery is confusing because each watch takes a different battery. To go to a watch repair is too costly."
4,Awesome Accoustics!,"I first listened to Rain Summer, when my sister left her copy at home when she went off to college. I put it in my cd player, and it hasn't come out since. Stephen Kellogg combines awesome musical talent, with an amazing voice that strikes a chord in your inner ear. If you like easy accoustic listening with feel good vibes, this cd is for you!"
1,Cheaply made!,"I bought this wallet for a gift. When I received it, I was shocked at how poorly and cheaply made this wallet was. Although made of leather, it reminded me of a wallet made at summer camp by kids (maybe it was!). There is no room for credit cards, more than five $1.00 bills and some change. And being so cheaply sewn together, I doubt it will last long."
5,New Millenium R&b,"hey this is album is the epitome of new age r&b and hip-hop. the album blends all music genres into a hodge-podge version of rhythm and blues. the album also unites song, poetry and music into one sultry, erotic eargasm. unique lyrics, harmonies and musical beats keeps the listener occupied at all times. no two tracks were alike! this is definitely a sleeper pick, thats not on a major label. check it out!"
3,"Good on it's own, bad as ""Volume 2""","I loved the first book in this series, and got this book to read more about the main character, Diora, and her mysterious, wonderful, terrifying world.Instead I got your basic sword-and-sorcery in a totally different world. Yeah, it's the same planet but the difference is as extreme as Afghanistan and Los Angeles.If you read this book without expectations of the first, it's not a bad book at all. The character of Jewel is fun. Valedan is not explored as deeply or as well as he should be, and I wish there had been more and simpler background on the Kings.A great deal is left to supposition and imagination. It reads like volume 2, but not of this series. Events and backgrounds are hinted at and it really seems like there MUST have been a book or a chapter missing. That's pretty annoying."
5,Worth pursuing,"This book broadens the scope of characters and plots involved within the North / South struggle. Focusing primarily on characters in the north it is interesting enough to offset impatience about leaving the characters in Book One temporarily behind. If you have read any of the House Wars series, specifically involving Jewel and her Den, you will find this volume interesting as it continues their journey and struggle. I was not disappointed ."
4,A great addition to the story of the Dominion and Empire.,"Each time I expect this book to descend into stereotype, I am pleasantly surprised. Ms West avoids the cliche elements of most fantasy adventures and concentrates instead on the characters and their development.In this book, the action moves from the Dominion to the Empire, where the players who will oppose the self proclaimed rulers of the Dominion are being identified and assembled. The book uses a contest of 'warrior's skills to develop and illuminate the character of both familiar and new personalities. It also broadens the scope of the impending conflict by making it clear that more than the rulership of a single nation will be decided. I enjoyed the fact that we were not subjected to endless pages of fight or chase descriptions. Instead, the actual physical events were used to deepen and enrich the characters."
4,"Good book, but Tas...","Good book. I wont say much about the book, but i want to say something about an old character: Tas.I hate to say it but Tas is really beginning to annoy me. I ALMOST wish he would stay dead. The problem is that he aint that funny anymore, and nothing he does now really surprises me. I think I'm sharing the same opinion as many of the old heroes of Krynn. Tasslehoff is really annoying, and sometimes I wish I could have been in the book to strangle him myself. But when he is gone, something is clearly missing. The authors should make Tas do something really surprising. In the Chronicles, the things he said and did were surprising and funny. Thats what made him so interesting."
3,An decent middle installment.,"Fans of the Dragonlance series might have bittersweet experience reading this book. It is excellent and true to form but looking back I can't help but feel some resentment because of how awful and disapointing the last book was. I would almost reccommend stopping here and leaving the world of Krynn just to avoid the awful ending.Weiss and Hickman are in their usual form here but the book lacks the great characters of other trilogies. Tas's schtick is starting to get old and not and I'm sorry but Palin is a poor man's Raistlin. Mina is mysterious at first but starts to get a little tedious. What works is the political intrigue among the elves, the final battle, the dragon hieracrchy and two Solamnic Knights. This makes for a page turner that is hard to put down.Curious fantasy readers who haven't read the fist one or the Chronicles and Legends series should stay away."
3,Depression,"I have read all of the other Dragonlance books by Weis and Hickman. The quality of this book is up to par with the rest of them, but I must say this book was filled with senseless deaths. It ranks up there with Dragons of a Summer Flame. I think that Weis and Hickman have a personal vendeta against all of their old characters.It was a well written book and I do recommend it to die hard fans, but if you have any affection whatsoever to some of the old characters, you may want to think twice about reading this series."
4,Good series,Not near as good as the first book in the series. Or as good as the original Dragonlance books. But still a great book.
4,Lives up to expectations,"Pretty good book. A bit sad the way it turns out for a few of the characters, but such was to be expected. Definitely a must read for fans of Weis and Hickman."
4,A Great Book For 13 and Up,"This book is an exciting novel for many ages. This book was obviously one of the greatest novels Weis and Hickman have ever writen. This thriller showed some of the greatest characters I have ever read. There isn't much more to say without giving away the plot, so I hope you read this book and enjoy it as much as I did!"
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"NO SPOILERS~I like the apocalyptical feel to this book, but I think that the approach of using obliteration to solve situations which were viewed to be problematic was an error on the authors' part. Not that there isn't anything good about the book. In fact, there are quite a few spine-tingling moments and as my first sentence stated, I like the dark way in which it was written (well, at least as far as DL goes). Still, there are too many things missing and the feeling that this book was rushed is prevelant- especially towards the end, I'm afraid.However, whining about this would only accomplish the fact that humans have a similiar DNA make-up to pigs tom selleck rules and I would have devoted my life to world peace if he had been the one god"
4,Great Book,"This book is a very good read. The reason i only gave it 4 stars, is i am comparingit too some of Weiss and Hickman's earlier work, which by far some of the greatest books ever written(Legends Saga). The Plot is ever moving. Really. The focus of the plot changes about 12 times in thsi book. Anybody who wants a good read, pick this up outta your local bookstore, or this freindly website. Its great.I also recommend The Recluce Saga, The Dark is Rising Sequence, and The Lord of the Rings series."
5,Another Great Book by MW and TH But...,"...but it wasn't long enough! I know it must be hard writing two books and many other short stories, the secret project, and campaigns and the like for the new game system, Sovereign Stone. The second book in the WOS trilogy is just about two hundred pages shorter than the first book in the series. And it leaves many questions unanswered. Yes we find out who the one god is, but even that is left unclear. We meet old characters, some old characters die. The elves start an exodus but their fate is also left unclear. I do think MW and TH could have gave us a little more but again the writing style in the book is the best and again they give us a great story. I wasn't disappointed."
3,weis & hickman correcting the 5th age,"it seems that this trilogy is mainly focusing on fixing the plot-shredding that jean rabe did to the DL series with her books - and in a way, cancelling out the entire ""5th age"" blunder that massacred the series six years ago. and tying up the loose ends with the few original characters left.unfortunetly, since almost all of the original DL chracters were killed off in previous books, all of the new characters in this series are unoriginal and uninspiring. even Tas seems much more shallow than in the chronicles and legends, while palin seems more like a bystander. and as someone pointed out before, there is *way * to much time spent dealing with the elves. hey weis and hickman - this is dragonlance, we want dragons. if i wanted pages and pages of elves arguing with eachother, we'll get tolkein instead.however, the book does the ""feel"" of the chronicles and legends, but not to such a great degree. better than the other DL material out there, at any rate."
5,They're Back!,"It took Weis and Hickman some time to warm up in the first book, but now they're all back. The characters that lacked depth in the first book, are now a lot better, and the plot is good too. I enjoyed this book almost as I enjoyed the original DL series."
2,Absolutely not enthralling,"The 2nd book in the ""War of Souls"" continues. New characters are fleshed out (Gerard, Mina, Medan) and old characters are included (Tasselhoff, Palin, Laurana, Dalamar, Cyan Bloodbane). All this and no intrigue. This book bored me, much the way part 1 did. Mina's knights continue their amazing success in battle and the origin of the Silvanesti shield is revealed. Mina defeating the Solamnics by scaring them with the dead souls was lame in my opinion, and the revelation of who the One God is was so very predictable. Not my favorite by these 2 authors."
2,Not bad but not great,This book is not a great book because I feel that it was written for preteens or 13 year olds. I read alot and forget most of the minute details from long ago series but the revelation of the one god was starkly obvious and I had hoped my guess was wrong. I was disappointed. The portion of the book dedicated to Qualinesti however was well done and the result surprising. The epilogue was well done and left a couple cliffhangers for the reader. Overall I felt that a short story could have stated the amount that actually happened.I hope Vanishing Moon will be a touch more sophisticated
3,Torn in a big way,"I can't decide, am I happy that Weis and Hickman are again putting their considerable writing talent to work back in the world that first brought me into fantasy reading? Or do I just want them to leave well enough alone. The book in itself was good read if a little slow at parts, but I can't help feeling a little cheated by a new saga after I thought they had ended things so nicely in Dragons of Summer Flame. I am still anxiously awaiting the third installment as Weis and Hickman are well deserving of loyalty(their's are the only Dragonlance novels I read), but I hope this isn't a sign that they are about to mire themselves in the mediocrity that typifies most of the other Dragonlance novels."
4,An honest 4 star intro to computers ... there are no 5 stars,"A very nice and hilarious introduction to computers. With the included virtual computer, you can learn quite a bit! (No pun intended). This book also includes interesting historical anecdotes. Find out what computers really do! (Not much, just move bytes about...). Enjoy!"
3,"Great book, but the software doesn't work with new computers","I loved the book, and was looking forward to trying the exercises using the software, only to find out that my PC with Windows 98 wouldn't run the stuff! How very disappointing. I tried to go to the website listed in the book, and it didn't appear to be up! Did it move or something? If the software was functional and worked as advertised, (and I have no reason to doubt that it would,) I would have rated this at least a 4, and possibly even a 5!"
5,Its not just for sheet cakes anymore !,This is a very nice heavy baking pan. I am very pleased with it. I have looked at alot of places for a pan like this and this is the place to buy one.
1,poor design for instal,I am sure the hitch may work well if it were ever able to be installed. The installation is dependant on a cheap wire that has to be fished through the bumber fram and gave out after the first bolt. Needless to say I am left here with no way to install.
2,Incorrect screen filter supplied,"The screen filter supplied is not going to work with the 2000 Cherokee 4.0L. Actually there are two; one that snaps onto the bottom of the pump and one that snaps onto the bottom of the pump/gauge sending unit assy. The one pictured with this pump works in niether place. I am not assuming you need to replace these two, you will. I am writing this in detail because it is a problem when the gas tank is out and you discover you need to find these filters and go buy them before you can put your car back together. Advance Auto Parts carries these filters; FS 220 and FS 221--$26."
3,wrong part,"This was ordered by mistake because the fuel pump for my car wasn't checked before ordering, evidently there was more than one possible fuel pump that might work, third time was the charm"
2,Wrong Filter for a TJ Wrangler,"I ordered this for a 99 Jeep Wrangler 4.0 and had the same issues as other reviews. The filter that comes on the pump will in no possible way properly fit into the sender. I had to run out for more parts to complete the project. Really disappointing that the Bosch website also recommends this pump so I can't blame Amazon, they get 5 stars for a quick delivery and great price. As another review mentioned get the FS220 and FS221 filters, I did and they are factory correct."
5,Pleasure,"Frued PKG0024As my use of the router has been increasing I needed something better than my old Craftsman 12X16 aluminum table with enough said about that.I decided to take a chance on the frued system. Well I am completely satisfied, not one complaint. The router is super and the collett was already in so no problem there. I do agree that the collect nut would be better with more depth on the nut.The fence is awesome doesn't have as much backlash in the adjustment than a good lathe. The plans for the base give surface dimensions that they recommend. Other than that they are useless. I consider this a good piece of equipment and recommend it in lue of building your own"
1,carpenter for the curatorial department at nantucket historical association,I'd love to review this tool when I receive it. Still waiting for delivery.
2,outer banks by bailey,"Although Bailey states the facts in his book THE OUTER BANKS,He should not have constructed this GEM on his first trip to the banks. Some of the places are not described well, as a tourist would who just rode by in a speeding car at dusk. Love and knowlege for the banks is deep. Alot deeper than one can jot down, or interview locals, or record in one trip. David Stickor Charles Whedbee are true BANKERS. If you want to know the banks read theirs. You would be as well off to grab the latestweek long, first time visiting tourist to tell you about his vacation as to buy this. Bailey writes well, but, needs more expertise on this subject. I'm not an expert on the BANKS, but more than once during this read I found my head shaking, thinking ""What is he thinking"". But this book is largely his opinion on foods, state of government, and people of the banks.But then again, I love OBX, and when there, I do not want to go home. I say STICK WITH STICK OR WHEDBEE!!"
3,Wish I purchased the .7 Kit instead,"Small kit includes the essentials and can fit it the glove compartment of a car, I should of spent the few $$ more an purchased the .7 kit. I bought the .7 kit anyway."
2,Not what i expected.,"Its much smaller than expected....its just a little larger than a wallet. Ill be needing to purchace another more suitable kit instead. Ill keep this on hand in the glove compartment for now, or just use the stuff in one of my other kits as a replacement. I guess i shoulda read the description a little better. It just feels...""cheap""."
1,Deceptive images,The image presented for the .3 is deceptive. The .3 does not come in a silnylon pouch as depicted in the image. I believe the pouch is a good part of the value of the product as it is bright yellow and is highly visible when in the pack and finding it quickly is of utmost urgency. Since the virtual shopping experience does not allow for hands on inspection of the product the images are critical that they are accurate and depict the product being purchased.
1,Almighty Bore,"Well this is as close to a ""0"" rating as one gets. Watched the trailer hoping it would get better. But it doesn't. Not gonna waste a dime on this crap. Got the real deal already on Blu-Ray."
2,Thought I was getting a different movie!,"After seeing the Avengers movie, I wanted to see the one about Thor. Thought I was downloading the latest Thor movie recently in theaters last year (2011), but this one turned out to be a ""made for TV movie"" instead. Special effects are a bit cheesy and the acting is mediocre at best. Needless to say after finally downloading the theater version simply named ""Thor"" released in May 2011, I finally got to see what I was hoping for."
1,Not what I expected,"I thought I was purchasing a newer release of Thor with actual actors in it. This particular release is something you'd find on the SciFi channel on a Saturday night at 4 in the morning. The acting is horrendous and the story unbelievable. Never, in any movie, have I seen the hero of the movie make so many bad decisions even after stating 30 seconds earlier he would make the correct decision. I've had more enjoyable evenings watching paint dry!"
4,Very effective device!,"The personal air purifier helps me breathe much better, even when in the vicinity of a lot of people. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the low grade noise that it produces. At any rate, I'm very pleased with this product. I used to wear a trache tube, and I'm still prone to catching a lot of colds, including pneumonia. So I can truly appreciate this device, especially when entertaining out-of-towners or visitors."
3,Needs more 50's Kitsch,"A very colorful book and fun to look at but,if your a baby boomer you will notice a lack of the real 50's kitsch items. Plastic items from the 60's and 70's forward are not my idea of Kitsch."
4,"Good looks, but low battery..","Good looks, good price, but low battery. I received this watch last night and open it in a happy mood. At first glance, looks good, but turned down when backlight on. It's low battery. That let me a little worry about the other watch quality in watchzone. That's why I just give 4 star. If this can be improved, five star can be expected. The quality should be kept no matter on sale or not, especially to so big seller on Amazon."
3,Good sun protection while it lasts.,"The Beach Depot Men's Long Sleeve Rash Guard Shirt I got has sleeves that are too short for my arms, even though I got the XXL. The stitching already started to come undone after the first wash. I'm going to try another rash guard that I hope will be more durable. I'm looking to buy a rash guard that can be washed in a washing machine as this one needs to be hand washed, which is a pain. The area of my skin that is covered by this rash guard is well-protected from the sun, so I'll still give this rash guard three stars."
3,Inaccurate information,Just a warning to would-be buyers that this is acutally only a 550W power supply and defintely NOT the 651W this listing mentions.
2,"Dated material, marginal index","I can't bring myself to be as harsh as the one star reviewers, but they more or less have it. If your engine is 10 years old or newer, you might be disappointed.My other complaint is that the index is not very good. It is not comprehensive, and it is split up by manufacturer (the latter could be good or bad per search)."
3,Out of Date,"The ""Product Details"" Amazon lists for this book which states ""Haynes Manuals, Inc.; 1 edition (September 25, 1998)"" is WRONG. Haynes is a different publisher and their 1998 publication is a totally different book. This Chilton book is copyrighted 1994 and is, consequently, 13 years out of date as of this review (August 2007). I verified this by ISBN number to a copy I checked out from my local library. Further, 1994 is the current edition listed on Chilton's website. So, if your engine is newer than 1994, the data will not be current.That said, this seems to be the most detailed and useful small engine repair book I have found. It may still be useful for some later models that may not have changed much. As previous reviewers have recommended, check your local library copy to see if the information might apply to your engine."
5,Wonderful item for a toddler!,"Gorgeous selection of classic nursery rhymes. Very entertaining and interactive for my 18 month old. Nice combination of animation & real scenery (farm, lakes, kids playing etc). Highly recommended."
3,Poor Quality,"My daughter loves this video. However, it is of poor quality. I had to return the first video I ordered because the beginning of the disc skipped. The replacement I received was even worse and skipped throughout the whole video. To avoid further hassle I am going to keep it and chalk it up to a cheap seven dollar video."
2,Too short,When I ordered this DVD I thought there would be more songs then there are. We have maybe 10 songs. Other than that it arrived on time and my 13 month old daughter loves it. Wish it had more on it!
5,Great for kids!,"My 1 year old loved it from the first time we played on tv for him. He likes to watch kids and puppets, love the songs and can watch the whole thing with no problems.We sing, dance and clap hands with him and the nursery rhymes became our daily routine.The are lyrics on every song so it is easy to sing together.Definitely recommended and I am searching for more."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I got this product which was not of good quality. Every time I started this DVD there would be static sound and it would get stuck a little bit every few seconds. So I returned it. That's about the bad DVD. I tried it on my Blu Ray Player, my computer and portable DVD player.Now for the contents of the CD - It is really really boring. Your child will not be attracted to it. It looks as if some one has shot the video in his own backyard. It's very very NON APPEALING for a child."
4,Baby Genius Favorite Nursery Rhymes w/bonus Music CD,Children's performance is cute. My 2-year old granddaughter loves to dance and sing along while watching this DVD. The accompanying CD is so-so.
2,cheap and cheesy,i was expecting so much more -- but even my children agree that this low budget production is not enjoyable in the least. worse than barney.
4,My 8 mos old LOVES this dvd. Much better than Baby Babble,I was pretty bummed after reading a ton of reviews and purchasing the baby babble video and feared all the other baby videos would be equally as bad. Found a great deal on a 2-pack of the baby genius videos at a local Target store and was surprised to find my daughter glued to the laptop when I put it in. She was clapping her hands together and jabbering with excitement for almost the entire thing. Hoping the rest of this collection is just as good as I plan to collect more of them.
5,Great for Toddlers!!!,"My 22 month old daughter loves this video. There is a cute song that teaches numbers 1-10. In less than one week she began saying and ""Recognizing"" each number individually which is awesome. She has also learned to recognize her alphabet by watching this video. She mostly enjoys singing and dancing to the nursery rhymes. She watches it over and over! This is a great supplement to Baby Einstein videos because its a little more fun and interactive. Special Note: we us a old portable dvd player that we keep on the coffee table so that she can sit in her own chair and watch her videos while we watch ""regular tv""...It keeps her busy while my husband and I enjoy our favorite shows..."
3,Nursery Rhymes CD,"There are a few songs that my son loves, but most of the songs are too ""slow"" and not upbeat enough for his tastes. He loves the DVD though"
3,Good entertainment!,"Little Ethan will watch this on occasion. His favorite though is Singing Babies, then Baby Mozart, and Baby Genius a close third."
2,Not very impressed,"I didnt like this a lot, the pictures and quality of the video was not very good..."
2,Nothing special ...,"Seems really outdated. The nursery rhymes are presented ok, but my 2yo son lost interest very quickely in this DVD."
5,Amazing Video,"My daughter just turned 9 months old. We got this video when she was 8 months old and started it then. She is GLUED to this dvd. She usually doesnt watch tv. Nothing usually can keep her interest. She is a very happy and hyper baby but when this movie is on she goes into this daze... She dances and laughs and smiles. She learned to clap and wave from dvd also. Its incredible how only about 2 weeks of watching this video can help her to develop so well. Im very impressed with this dvd. I wish Baby Geinus made more nursery rhymes.... We highly recommend this video to all parents looking for an entertaining, yet learning movie for their children."
2,Not real happy,"This was a gift for my 1 year old grandson and whne we opened it, there appeared to be water holding inside the case and upon further investigation, it smelled like a ton of Febreeze had been dumped into the case and left. I am not sure if this is a problem with the buyer or the originating company."
4,Baby likes the dvd!,I bought the DVD for my almost 3 month old son. He seems to really like it. I put it on and he falls asleep in his swing. He really likes when his big brother sings along to him.
5,10 month old loves this!,"My 10 month old daughter loves this DVD. She does not see anybody else when this DVD is playing. Amazing! I would try other Baby Genius DVD. For the price, there is nothing much to lose!"
1,Very disappointing!,"I bought this DVD/CD combo after reading rave reviews and have to say that I'm highly disappointed. I expected the DVD to show actions along with the rhymes so my 2 year old would watch and learn to act along. Instead most of the songs have cheesy animation that failed to hold my toddler's attention. The scenes change too fast, they're not coordinated with the rhyme, for instance, when the rhyme goes ""the cat takes the rat"", the scene shows kids on a pony or kids running around. The bonus CD has many additional songs but it seems like a cheap production where the singers don't sing the words clearly. How is a toddler going to learn the lyrics if you can't hear the words clearly in the din of the background music? If I had to do this again, I wouldn't waste my money on this!"
5,Absolutely love it and best value,This is an excellent DVD compared to baby einstein products. We introduced it to my son when he was 15 months and he loves it. This not only calms him down but he has learnt various things from it. We brought it from Walmart for $6.99 and it also has a bonus audio CD. The value is unbeatable. I would recommend it to everybody.
2,favorit nursery rhymes cd,this is a good cd to play while traveling with your lil ones it keeps them content. id recommend it but prefer the giggle bellie dvds they are the BEST!!! i highly rate them
5,Very Satisfied...just what I wanted!,"This DVD has the basic Nursey Rhymes that I wanted my grandson to be able to learn and uses mostly real life animals and kids in the video, which I much prefer over animation. I feel like it is a good value and am happy with the purchase. Love that it also has a CD of the songs as well!"
4,I like the Size !,"I have alot of cookie sheets. In my collection I have calaphon, wilton , kaiser etc. I bought 4 of these cookie sheets. They are a great size. I can fit all 4 into my oven at one time. They are a little heavier then I would like. with the use of a siilcone sheet I have made some great cookies. I have had these for about 4 months and used them quite a bit for the holidays and they still look new."
1,Does non-stick refer to the packaging?,"Everything sticks to these pans! I cannot get OFF the potato residue and I'm probably just going to throw them away.They are awkwardly heavy. They do not warp, but they do pop out of shape (this happens when the pans are in the oven and you'll hear a very loud, scary pop).Just awful."
1,horrible cookie sheet,"everything sticks to this pan, everything stains it. it gives kitchenaid a bad name."
5,Excellent book for accounting beginner or expert!,"Madeline Bailey's approach to accounting in this excellent book is practical, understandable and easy to read. What more do you need?"
3,Pretty good,"This book is amazing. It's such a great resource for social workers. Doelling tells you step.by.step about the interviewing and writing of the resume process. By breaking it down and giving a lot of resources, she makes it comprhendable and less intimidating. This book is good for social workers who work in a variety of capacities, not just direct service. I am a policy practitioner and this book has resources for me too!"
5,Amazing fresh talent!!!,"I just saw Jill in NYC 2 hrs ago (11/2407 - Pete's Candy Shop, Brooklyn, NY) and she blew my mind! Her lyrics grab your attention within 10 seconds and never let go. She was solo, playing guitar or keyboard along with singing... beautiful voice, very talented and soon to be mainstream. Overall, her lyrics are love wrenching while griping. A must listen for any lover out there."
4,Great CD,I bought this CD for one track in particular. I found out that I really enjoyed the rest of the songs on the CD. Nice sound quality.
2,Defective Disc,The disc was defective - it would not play completely through two of the titles. Disappointed in quality not disc.
3,Should have bought the CD,The choice of songs is good and the group is great but I do wish I'd gotten the CD rather than the MP3 download. Whoever ripped these files needs more practice. The bitrate varies widely between songs and the overall quality is far below other MP3 songs I have.
5,Best of the Seekers,"An excellent CD, much better than the original LP I had years ago. Recommend this album most highly. Some of the songs, South Australia and Waltzing Matilda, in particular, have subjects unique to Australia, which makes them even more interesting. Lyrics to the CD's songs are readily available off the Internet. Look up ""Waltzing Matilda"" in Wikipeda for a fascinating history of the song."
2,Seekers - the forgotten Aussie band,"Recommended for true fans of the Seekers. This is a complete selection of all the Seekers' hits over several years from the 60's and 70's. Throw away your Ambien - this WILL send you to sleep.If you want to sample other ""Aussie"" music - try Men At Work, InXS, Crowded House, Natalie Imbruglia, The Bee Gees, Sky Hooks, the Divinyls, ACDC.. the list goes on."
5,This is another great book by the Author!,"I read World Stompers and also enjoyed that book. Eventhough this book does not have photo's(I'm a Photojournalist) it is a great piece of work. I would have listed a few more places than in the book, but still fantastic work.I have been to many of the places listed in this book and his description is 95% on track.Zentravel"
4,Not bad,These tweezers are a little flimsy but definitely get the job done. I used them for this small job. Nothing else could have helped like I needed so I was glad to have purchased these.
1,Usless,I guess I should have read the other reviews before buying these tweezers!They arrived in a previously opened package taped with clear tape.They are made from very thin metal that makes them very flimsy and useless.Do not buy them.
2,nice,"For price it is good, but can't do good job, because they are not strong, and they are kind of ""not tight"" which makes them useless in some situations..."
1,Poor quality,There is a reason these are cheap it is because they are flimsy as cardboard. You couldn't grip anything with these
1,Junk,"These are pure junk! Extremely flimsy. Very thin metal that will not hold it's shape. I wanted the reverse tweezers, they are worthless. When you sqeeze to open, they will not close."
1,Highly disappointing product!! Product Seconds???,This product appears to be manufacturer seconds. One of the tweezers has a point half ground off and has no structural strength. The Item was placed in the packaging to hide the defect. Do not buy.
5,handy little tweezers,"I have used these tweezers in all sorts of ways - splinters, picking up beads and stickers for scrap booking and for plucking bits out of my dogs coat! very handy and sturdy!"
3,not bad,"It's not bad considering the price. Those will do for my paper scale modeling. Don't put too much pressure on those, because they bend very easy. Its a nice set hat makes it easy to get in those tight spaces, too bad it's not very durable."
3,Decent for the price - in a disgusting box,"I ordered these for picking at parts inside computers and such, not expecting much; I mean, it's $5 for 4 pairs of tweezers, including shipping. The tweezers themselves are fine. As others have noted, they are cheap metal, and may need to be bent into shape. I did get all four different tweezers pictured unlike some reviewers.However, the tweezers came in a box that looked like it'd suffered a good bit of water damage, with cardboard peeling and a green splotch of some composition. (I'm slightly afraid to look at it through my microscope...) I'm amazed an Amazon employee would pick up that item yet still package and ship it in that condition.So this product (assuming you don't pay much more than I did) is a decent deal, just be warned that it just might not arrive in the best of shape, and will likely need some tweaking."
1,Minus Five Stars,"Junk, garbage, completely unusable! I expected cheap construction when I bought these and not the best quality but these exceeded my expectations for ""cheap Chinese junk"". I expected steel at least, these were something like tin or soft aluminum (not sure of the metal). They bent very easily and there is no way these things would ever pick anything up without deforming. I did find one thing that they were good for . . . gracing the garbage can!"
1,4 Piece Tweezer Set,The tweezers are terrible. I threw them straight in the trash when I got them. There is no spring in the arms to open and close and they are very lightweight. You get what you pay for...
1,Terrible,There is no seperation or curve to these tweezers. They are two pieces of cheap metal next to eachother (all 4 of them are). They look nothing like the picture.My fingers work better than these.
3,You don't get what's shown in the photo,"I ordered this set of tweezers mainly for the paddle tweezers shown in the photo and in the written description, ((1) 4-3/16"" straight, paddle-tip). Unfortunately they are the one pair of tweezers I did not get. They were replaced by a 2nd larger version of the clamping (squeeze to open) tweezers."
1,Not worth the price,"None of the pieces met at their tips, had to rebend to make them meet. When you picked something up, they returned to their original shape. The flat ""duck-bill"" piece weren't aligned. The ""squeeze to release"" were beyond using. Not worth the low-price, made of cheap pressed tin. Very disappointed. Threw in the trash."
1,Not useable as a tool,"So cheaply made that not only do they cut your hands, they are not useable as a tool or otherwise."
2,What you see is NOT what you get.,"If your looing for the 4 types of tweezers shown then, dont expect to get what your wanting. items are fine for the price but they do NOT include the paddle tweezers that i was hoping to get and they replace it with a log shoddyly made squeeze tweezer. defintly mass made in some 3rd worlds back yard production facility. and definitly a BOIL before human use look to them. Thankfully i will only be using them for a hobby and not on anything else. They just look cheep and poorly made. avoid them if your looking for quality."
3,ok for the price,The quality is not what I would have like. Specifically if I squeeze too hard the tweezers start to bend. For the price they are a decent set. I only use them for crafts nothing too hard core.
2,Not as pictured.,The product I received was incorrect from the picture and description. For the price it wasn't worth my time though. I received a giant tweezer set.
1,Just Say No,"Just say no to this purchase. Not worth the buck, or the five bucks total. Absolute trash right out of the packaging. If you saw these first hand, you'd never buy them. I thought I'd grab a steal and buy them, but now I just have to repurchase something better. Total waste."
1,These tweeze the money out of your pocket,"Bad Quality Hit List:- poor construction- easily bent- 3 out the 4 tweezer tips do not meet- no precision grip on any piece- no metal grip markings like in the picture- tips bend back even if gripping small rigid objectStay Away, please, do it for the children..."
1,4 pieces of crap,"Save your money and time, don't buy this set. Each one is just two thin flat sheet metal stick together, tried to bend one into workable shape but it fell apart. Really doesn't worth more than 50 cents for the whole set. I am returning the set.Very disappointed. Amazon, don't sell junk on your site!"
1,Extremely poor quality--unusable.,These tools are not even good enough to be toys. They are stamped out of metal just barely thicker and stronger than tin foil. Buyer beware!
1,Extreme cheap,"Extremely cheap product. Made in ChinaThese tweezers would be hard to sell for .99 cents. They are THAT cheap. Listen to this review, this product is not worth the shipping if they gave you the product for free. I cant believe they even qualify for the name tweezers.Save your money and put it toward the nice (read: real) tweezers on Amazon.The metal is so thin, my 7 year old literally bent them between three fingers on the same hand. I'm embarrassed to have spend more than a dollar for them. I accept my mistake to save each of you looking to buy them so I'm writing this review. It does not deserve one star, but there is no lower choice."
5,Great!!!,"I really like Nancy Sinatra, and this CD has all the reasons why on it. What a voice! What a talent! From Jackson to Dover this Lady-Bird really soars. My personal favorite is ""Some Velvet Morning"" (don't ask me to explain its meaning), but, just like her father, Nancy manages to inject greatness into everything she sings. Do your ears a favor and get this one."
5,Quiet Power,"I own two PC-690 routers which work great. Needing more power for my second router table I was spooked by so many recent negative reviews for PC routers.I went instead for the Dewalt DW618K and it works great. Very quiet, with smooth starts and stops. The extra 1/2 HP vs my PC-690 runs my large inlay bits no problem.According to the box, pieces of this router are made in three or more countries. It all works together great.The spiral depth adjust is better than on my old PC for under table use. The Dewalt uses a rotating jacking ring which leaves the body stationary. Not rotating the motor housing prevents power cord interference which happens with the PC.Comes with a nice tote bag, now I can take my Dewalt hammer drill out of the Hitachi bag."
4,"AKC Complete Dog Book, 19th Edition","I recommend this book to every novice who wants to learn about types of dogs able to compete in conformation shows as it gives the AKC official standard of each breed. However, this book needs to be updated very soon. There are at least 9 new breeds that have been added to the Amercian Kennel Club since this publication.In general this is a great source of reference for the avid dog lover. But if you want to know about every dog breed in the universe, you should purchase and Encyclopedia of Dogs for this."
4,Complete Dog book review,"My husband is a dog show judge and has been looking for this book. As always, Amazon has what I need. This book is 2 yrs out of date, but this isn't Amazons' fault. Overall, the dog standards have not changed, except AKC has added some new breeds that aren't listed. Will be valuable with our breed (miniature Dachshunds)."
4,Recovering MFA Survivor,As a recovering survivor of an MFA program I can wholly relate to Elkins' criticisms about the failure of critiques to shape art and artists. It is poignant that Elkins is unable to offer up a solution.
4,to be read BEFORE entering Art School,"this book is not for current art students, or graduates (it's simply too late for you to read this)considering the expensive and time consuming path of art training at the University level ? then i recommend reading (or even just skimming) ""Why Art Cannot Be Taught : A HANDBOOK FOR ART STUDENTS"" not only because it gives a clear overview of the evolution of the methods of passing craftsmanship in the fine arts through (European) history, but because you'll see that picking a few art classes is probably going to serve you far better than undertaking a full course of study (and the stories of ""classroom psychodrama"", and students having to explain and defend their work was easily worth the price of the book, IMHO)"
1,...,"I ordered this book for a class that started on January 5. Understandably, I did not expect the book to come immediately but it took a whole month for it to be delivered! In that time, I had to purchase another copy from the bookstore. I won't be using this seller again."
5,Dog Toy,"This is a toy I found in a pet shop over ten years ago. I now own a second Yorkie since then, and she loves it also."
4,it works!!,this compressor is very compact yet it does everything that I need it to do such as car and bike tires and sports equipment. It was easy to assemble the hose and easy to use.
4,compressor,"This is truly a very nice compressor for the money. It is easy to carry around, etc. I have a bigger air compressor for my shop but needed a smaller one for the garage so I didn't have to pull my vehicles to the shop for airing the tires, etc. and this Campell Hausfield fits the bill."
2,Sadly disappointed.,"I was looking forward to using this litte baby, but was sadly disappointed when I got it. Noisy is an understatement. You will need noise protection to use it. Pressure is another issue. It will not maintain PSI above 20 on continuous use. Good for airbrushing I guess, but nothing else. Maybe I am being picky about this little wan-a-be, but all I wanted was constant pressure for cleaning stuff. Didn't get it."
3,BUY IT CHEAPER AT TRACTOR SUPPLY,"THE HEADING SAYS IT ALL. $59.95 BRAND NEW @ TSC, OTHERWISE HAVEN'T USED IT YET."
4,Air Compressor,Campbell Hausfeld FP2048 2 Gallon Air Compressor & 8 Piece Accessory Kit.This compressor worked as it should. It is great little unit. that is its only drawback. To Small
1,Chinese Junk,"Pure junk. All I've ever used it for it topping off my auto tire pressure. To pump up a flat tire will take about 4 refills of the tank. This thing is grossly under power. The hose tips are junk--almost worthless. The tire tip works, but is clumsy and hard to get seated on the valve stem. I wouldn't recommend it for anything but filling up bicycle tires. Oh, did I mention that the thing is very noisy? I will never buy anything from Campbell-Hausfeld again. Cheap China-made junk. BTW, the gauges are inaccurate too."
2,weak,Not a good compressor. if you want to do anything beyond blowing up balls.It Will not handle tires.Unit kicks on at lot when running to recharge tank.If you want a real compressor don't buy this one!
1,[bad] genre.,"If I could have given it 0 stars, I certainly would have... I mean, come on, who wants a CD with 38 songs on it? And I believe some of the songs are as short as 20 or 30 seconds. I don't quite understand the relevance of having short songs just to be able to have large amounts of tracks on the CD... Grindcore is a disgrace to music."
4,Sounds Good!,The two lead off tracks of Brazil andLost City are two of the best one-twopunches in the history of popular music.This is 1965? The Beatles 65 pales compared tothe musicianship ofto Hank and the boys. I don't have a technicalknowledge of recording but I suspect the needleswere in the red on Lost City. Hank has nevergotten the credit he deserves in the states butthe shadows never played much here. The vocal tracksas usual are throwaways. You have read manytimes of all aspiring guitarists who have tried toachieve that sad echo of Hank's strat. Don't expectthis trend to end any time soon. Mike Caldwell
1,i like my hi-md but...,"the player is way cool, the software that comes with it is not. sonic stage sucks. for the first week it wouldn't take any of the my mp3. it just crashed. i spend the whole week trying to find out what was wrong with it. it turned out that it didn't like the tags on the mp3s. the other uncool thing is that if for some reason you loose your music in your computer, the software won't allow you do download it from the player. its either loose it or leave it. i don't know if i would recomend it. it is a pain. sony really screwed it up."
5,Best ever - but measure your oven!,"This is the best cookie sheet I have ever owned. When I bought it, I failed to measure my oven first. It didn't fit. Fortunately the landlord was replacing the oven and the new one accommodated the size. So measure your oven before buying. The best part of this item: You can cut down on the number of trips to the oven for a batch of cookies by at least 1/3 with this sheet. Enjoy!"
5,Cookie Sheet,It is a wonderful product that cleans easily and bakes well so that cookies or etc. slides off easily.
4,Good book,"This book is for my Alcohol, Drugs and Behavior course at the University of California. Seems to have a lot of useful information. Haven't used it a whole lot but glad to have it."
2,Not too Happy = ),The individual selling this product put the status as very good/like new it had water damage. I don't really care about the fact that it has water damage! However; don't lie about your product and advertise your product for something it isn't!!
3,Firestone Ride-Rite,The ride rite kit was farily easy to install and works ok. The only problem I have with the ride rite is that the air line pressure fittings leak. I inflated the bags to 50 psi and the next morning one was down to 39 psi and the other was 35 psi. I've repeated this several times with the same results. I've removed the air lines made sure they were cut evenly and the results were the same. I've used soapy water to check the fittings and they have slow leaks. I'm also concerned with the heat shield not working on my Dodge. The muffler and tail pipe are right next to it. The shield does not come down to completely cover the air bag. The plastic air line is also close to the tail pipe where it comes out the top of the air bag. Copper lines would be a better application. Looks like I'll be keeping a compressor in the truck. If anyone has a solution to this please let me know with a reply to this review.
5,Beautiful prose,"This is one of the best novels I have read this year. The prose is exquisite, the pacing is wonderful - neither too fast nor too slow, and the characters spring to life and remain with you.Beyond the themes others have discussed in their reviews, I think this novel illustrates beautifully how parents really know their offspring but offspring rarely fully understand their own parents as there are sides to our parents that we cannot possibly see precisely because we are their children.I liked this and would love to read it again.As to me - I read a lot of literature, not a lot of best sellers, and lots of fiction written by writers of Middle East origin and Asians and SouthEast Asians in particular because I like it. I am a fan of Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Seth and Ahdaf Soueif to give you an idea. If you like any of these writers or these types of books, then you will probably also like this book."
1,Required reading for school,"I'm sure there's plenty of people who could enjoy this book judging by the amount of high ratings, but it did not cut it for me. I had to read it for a history class. I found the main characters unlikable. I couldn't stand the very bourgeois attitudes and I found the youngins to be spoiled brats. Especially the main character Raheen, who seems incapable of thinking about anyone but herself and needs to take a chill pill. I personally wouldn't suggest it, but like I said it seems like some people really dug it so who knows! Can't argue taste :p"
3,Poor Choice of Words,The novel was readable however the author used too many words that were difficult to understand. I wasn't anticipating needing a dictionary to look up words that could have been replaced with simpler words. I felt the author was trying too hard to stretch her so-called intellect. I really hated this book actually - just for that reason. The story was good enough but it just missed something.
2,Regency with added imagination,"Don't confuse this book with one of Sara Blayne's books, A Noble Resolve, A Noble Deception, A Noble Pursuit. It is a very different book. The heroine's temper is evident, in my personal view her behavior differs from what one might expect of a heroine in a regency setting.However the author does sell so you may like this one."
5,Pet sounds of elephant variety,"In short, there are enough breezy harmonies and wind instruments scattered among the strawberry fields to make you forget the last 30 years ever happened."
5,great review of the ground war in WW II from a doctor,"This is a very good book that dispells the notion that World War II was a ""good war"". It was a horror that was almost unspeakable. This is an autobiographical account of the european conflict from a batallion surgeon attatched to an infantry batallion. This is a very realistic portrayal of the hardships endured by the citizen soldier from the US. There is no false sentimentality here. This work is along the line of the work done by Paul Fussell. Both of these authors were there in combat and both deride the empty way in which our society has degraded the fighting man by making him look like ""John Wayne"". As everyone in the US Army knows the biggest insult that drill instructors give is to call someone ""John Wayne""."
2,Oh dear poor Harriet,not your usual laugh out loud Jilly Cooper..light and predictable a bitslow and disappointing. Felt I wanted to get a hold on Harrietand give her a good shake
4,Good Axim X5 wireless card,This is a very handy card to help me stay connected to the internet on my Axim X5. It is easy to configure. I wished that it would automatically connect to available networks instead of having to type them in though.
1,0 Star - Bad Card for Dell Axim,"I had all kinds of problem with this card. The first time I installed it, it will not associate with my WAP. So I used LinkSys online support, which recommended to reinstall it. After re-installation I was able to associate with my WAP. It used to take 10 mins to scan for my WAP. I reinstalled it, another recommendation from Linksys support. I was able to scan pretty quickly, but was very inconsitent when I would open IE or MSN.The Linksys support was not really helpful. I bought NetGear card, and it worked like a charm and no problems so far"
4,It works mostly,"Got this card for my Casio E-125 PocketPC. Fits quite snuggly in the CF slot, but it goes in with a little patience. The drivers out of the box said that it did not work with the ""connected device"". So I downloaded the slightly newer driver from the website. The new driver installed and I was able to set the SSID during installation. But the Linksys Wireless CF Control panel doesn't work keeps saying that I'm missing a progam or library. (I've reinstalled numerous times to no avail)I can however connect, so the only access control I can turn on is MAC level from the access point (USR8011). I suspect WEP is setup in the control panel that I can't start on the E-125.Drains the battery significantly as well. Equivalent to running some media playback, and having the screen on all the time (cause that's pretty much what you'll be doing).Connects fast! Maybe a second or two and the card is connected.So it works adequately, I just don't know if I'm missing anything with the lack of WEP."
