4,Another solid release.,"""Bad Luck Streak In Dancing School"" #20 (1980).Oh Warren was deep into drinking on his follow up to ""Excitable Boy"",but he tried hard to stay sober on this project. Still he puts out some great material here in, the title track, the Naomi Neville cover ""A Certain Girl"", which hit #57, good rocking' piece. The gothic rocker ""Play It All Night Long"", is one of my favorites from Warren, the line ""The cattle all got Brucellosis"", is just great since I worked on a cattle farm, in the 80's,90's and early 2000's, not many writers could come up with that line. ""Jungle Work"", is solid rock, the Springsteen Zevon number ""Jeannie Needs A Shooter"", 2 greats on a rocking' tune. ""Bill Lee"", about spaceman Bill Lee, a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox and Montreal Expos. ""Gorilla, You're A Desperado"", is fun little song, ""Bed Of Coals"", has that lovely steel guitar whine. Warren would release a live album in 1981."
4,Not his best but still a good one,"Not as good as his two previous albums but still a good album. Warren Zevon is his heydays : bullets, shots, UZI etc.The single that came from this album A Certain Girl is a cover but it is good and suits zevon well. There is also a collaboration with Bruce Springsteen on this album - a great track called Jeannie needs a shooter.The rest of the songs is also good - typical Zevon .His West Coast buddies are all singing and playing along (Ronstadt, Lindley, Frey, Browne, Souther etc)All in all this album is a must for a real zevon fan and one of the better ones out of his total CD output. People that go for his greatest hits should not buy this but eg Genius, the best of Warren Zevon"
5,"WZ's best, but they all are (except ""Wanted"")","Snippets of what could be Warren's missing symphony mix well into ten great songs that are pure Zevon. Full of vitality, it's a great example of how absurd (""Gorilla, You're A Desperado""), beautiful (""Empty Handed Heart"") or angry (""Play It All Night Long"") he could be, while also including the greatest sports-related song ever, ""Bill Lee"". Oh, yeah, and the Toussaint cover, ""A Certain Girl"", rules! Hey, they all rule!"
2,Not A Helpful Book,"I cannot agree with the glowing recommendations given this book. I found this book to be very disappointing, especially given the apparent 'how-to' nature of the title. Most of the book contains a rather withering critique of the party structure & operations in the authors' community during the 2004 election. While the complaints may be valid, it crosses the line between constructive criticism and finger-pointing. The prescription for rebuilding is very general, without the detailed point-by-point guidance that an inexperienced activist might need to pull off the desired result. Also, some of the proposals are beyond the scope of a local activist to accomplish in his or her own community, as they require changes in state or Federal law. In conclusion, there are many other references I would recommend over this book."
3,Why is there a seam in the back?,I would like these much better if they didn't have a seam in the back. One seam on the side works well for other similar products....I didn't notice it until they arrived (I guess I wasn't a careful consumer!). Aside from that they seem well made and with good materials.
4,I'd buy these again!,"These are much easier to use than the punch down style jacks. Snap it in, plug in the cable. You're done."
3,JUST OKAY NOT GREAT,"I normally would not purchase a cat5e coupler as one tends to loose data due to poor connection, but could not complain about the price for gold plated connections and just needed to extend a couple feet and did not want to buy another cable. Need to make sure you have a good connection even if you feel and hear the plug click into place."
5,"A look backwards, brings the present in focus!","What a great book Great Ages of Man Renaissance is. Mr. Hale brings historical Italy alive as it's people strive to pull themselves into a greater time of beauty, charm and sensuality. The journey of the Italians produce great leaps in literature, art, learning and the excitement of being scholarly.I have read many of the books in this Time Life series - and have found this one to generate a great feeling of desire to visit Italy to experience the treasures Hale exposed. Somehow, when I make it to Italy, I know that it will be through a clear focused lens that I will see it.What a great book, both the writing, presentation and the wonderful art.Don't miss it!"
4,Not bad,A bit too much talking and such but there are quite a few nice international girls in this production. Viva La France!
1,"World Soccer, yea right",There is no soccer. The teams are entirely fictional. There is no game. The women are blah blah blah. It's just a playboy photo shoot with a script for the girls to read.
3,short coming extraodinare,"VAC have some truly good music mind you.(""Falling Snow"" is a great song) However VAC is not consistent and ""Church of Acid"" seems to flail while falling into the catotonic dribal that makes up to much of what we will call industrial/EBM/and Darkwave. For this matter so have all his other albums. The recording quality is terrible and the ability to procure an oringinal sound by most industrialites have always been a feebling attempt or a gesture that laped up the blood of Skinny Puppy. Now Skinny Puppy were amazing and we all loved them but argue it till you drop dead VAC is just another existential melodrama cartoon that lives in the shadow of a giant no matter what you have cloned them for.(Leatherstrip, Placebo Effect, so on) As good as Front Line assembly and Front 242 have ever been... no one else has been Skinny Puppy."
3,Interesting but....,"Man it would nice to see him do an album of jazz/rock covers. For some reason he must do originals. Even though he is a genius, we'd like to hear you interpret some classics."
3,conspriacy of fear,"I watched conspiracy of fear today...Although the plot and story line of the movie are good and Mr. Davies acting was great...He is a very believeble bad guy!!! The problem with the movie is the filthy language and the hooker and her John getting it on in the hall way...I wish hollywood would hire some writers who can write dialog instead of filling in with profanity because they can't write...I know there are people who talk like that on a dailey basis, but I also know there are people who don't...I would not recommend letting kids watch this movie, but for adults it is a good thriller..."
2,Packs well,"Great if you don't actually need a sleeping bag. I thought, ""It's cheap and light, probably great for beaching camping in southern Baja, Mex."" I froze even with two blankets."
4,Only for newbie-tles,"When I was 18, I made a cassette copy from a copy of a copy from vinyl of this recording. It's what really got me into The Beatles. I listened to it continuously! However, there really isn't much reason to own this collection if you've got all the other CD's (except for the slightly different 'A Day in the Life'.) But great for Newbies."
5,Gift,A Xmas gift for my youngest son. He loves the Beatles . This keeps him from stealing my my CD's
5,The Beatles '67-'70,Great songs from 3 great years. Octopus's Garden is one of my all time favorites! Can listen to it over and over again and never tire of it.
5,I agree!,"Hearing this pathetic excuse of a song compilation has only made me appreciate even more the wonderful talents of the Strolling Drones and their wonderful lead singer Mr. Jerry Atric. All the Beatles could muster in a short eight-year recording career were unknown ditties like Hey Jude, Strawberry Fields Forever and Revolution. Now, just compare that to the sheer 'quality' of the Drones' wonderfully uniform output in the TWO DECADES of the 1980's and the 1990's. (Frankly, I prefer music that offers no surprises. At least with the Drones, you know exactly what you're going to get.) There's simply no comparison, is there? I mean, it's not like they're in it just for the money or anything.Also recommended: 'RESTRING YOUR HARMONICA IN FIVE EASY STEPS' by Jeff Burns."
5,I am blown away,"This is the best CD I have ever listened 2. I got it today and its great. Im thinking of getting the other one(1962-1966) also. Its a little pricy but worth the money, so get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Blue Album is a great collection of Beatles' hits.,"If you're a beginning Beatles fan,the Blue album is the album for you.It contains some of the Beatles' best work.The album contains the best tracks from Abbey Road,some classic songs from the White Album,and three quarters of the fantastic Magical Mystery Tour album.The best songs on the album are Paul's Hey Jude and Let it Be.In fact, there my most favorite Beatles songs. All together, this is a must for any beginning Beatles fan.I'd also reccomend getting the Red Album as well.It contains some of the Beatles' best early years songs.Tim Lewis-10 yrs."
3,67-70 Beatles Way to Great for a Compilation.,"Ok I don't have a real problem with the Red 62-66 compilation. Its nice to have the Beatles best from their early albums on 2 CDs but there is no way you can take albums like Abbey Road, White Album, and Sgt Peppers and splice them together this way. Sure these are all great songs but there is no flow, and there are way to many missing songs. I mean really where's the Abbey Road medley (essential as they come), Birthday, Blackbird, and the list goes on... Enjoy collecting all the original albums, one at a time, then make your own mix if you must, but don't think 67-70 really tells the story, It don't !"
4,Generally Great Stuff By a Generally Great Band,"For those who like (or would like to own) the Beatles in a casual way, this album and its red-cased companion provide probably most of what you want. This disk covers some very fertile ground(since it's Sgt Pepper's territory, it would almost have to) - the trippy ""Strawberry Fields"", the even-more-trippy ""Lucy in the Sky"", ""Revolution"", ""Let It Be"", and the only-could-be-recorded-in-1967 ""All You Need Is Love"" (with Mick Jagger on backing vocals - or did we forget that?). That isn't to say there isn't some extraneous stuff here. I was never a big fan of ""Hello Goodbye"" or ""Long and Winding Road"", but hey, I'm sure they had fans - they both went number one. A good CD buy for the casual fan and the curious.ps. Let's save the my-band-is-better-than-your-band stuff for the N'Sync/Backstreet Boys crowd."
5,A thorough and satisfying collection,"A more thorough overview of their significant hits from the respective period than the companion Red album, all twenty-eight of the songs included on ""1967-1970"" (The Blue Album) are rock classics.We're treated to a generous seven of the eleven tracks from ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's"" is accurately represented as well. Another bonus is the faster, more popular version of ""Revolution,"" different than what was included on ""The White Album.""From trippy pop (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""I Am the Walrus"") to classic rock (""Get Back,"" ""Come Together,"") to their all-time epic masterpiece (""A Day in the Life""), this compilation of the Beatles is virtually without error. For baby boomers, a trip down memory lane. For musicians, a textbook on composition and production. For lovers of pop and rock music, an unbeatable treasure."
1,never recieved,"Well, it is December 22 and I still have not received this cd. I ordered it on November 18, it says it shipped on the November 25. I tried to contact the seller and never heard from them. What else can I say."
1,67-70,"This is so bad I don't know where to start, with the awful singing on Strawberry Fields ""Foreveh"" (as the singer pronounces it, or barely mediocre Ballad of John & Yoko (who cares?)...At least the record company segregated the early years from the later years so you don't have to buy this one. Check out the red album."
4,Bum Bum takes a back seat..,"Obviously Mr. Green (see review below from the canadian, T. Green) does not understand music. While the Bum Bum song is cutting edge, I do not feel that it has the diversity nor staying power of a classic such as the White Album. Therfore, I would not rate the Bum Bum song as being better than the White Album (although it is close) Thank you."
3,A Beatles Greatest Hits Compilation? Forget it!,"I rate this album three stars, which is as low as I could ever go for a Beatles album. Not that any of these songs are lacking, it's just that the thought of a Beatles Greatest Hits album leaves me extremely cold. This and the red album are for novices - people who don't take music seriously. If you want a taste (and who can do with just a taste) of the Beatles, I agree with another reviewer who said, ""Buy a real Beatles album""."
5,..And in the end..,"After The Beatles retired from touring,they could've easily became complacent especially after changing the face of pop music.But this is where the fun really begins.67-70 represents their studio years where they took their music to unimaginable hieghts(Strawberry Fields Forever,SGT PEPPER,Magical Mystery Tour) then they came crashing down(the white album,Let It Be)and went out in style(Abbey Road).Though a much better collection than 62-66(and you don't get shortchanged this time),these two sister albums represent the epitomy of pop music,and required listen for any musician to show them how its suppose to be done,as well as a must have for any music fan.Granted the whole picture can be found on their individual albums(especially Rubber Soul,Revolver,Sgt Pepper,Abbey Road),but once you experience these two,you will want more.A splendid time will be guarunteed indeed."
5,Great!!!,"One advice, buy it!! It has so many great beatles songs, I don't know where to begin. All the tracks are good. But ""While my guitar gently weeps"" and ""A day in the life"" are maybe my favorite songs. ""Old brown shoe"" is a really sweet song too. Everyone should own a copy of this cd!!! This is the fab four at their best:)"
2,"Once again, pointless","Just as with the red album, this compilation is not representative of the best of the Beatles. They choose ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" to represent the white album? That alone is illogical. Nearly all of the tracks from MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR are here, but not as many from the white album or SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. And the fact that anyone would include ""Octopus's Garden"" in a list of the Beatles' greatest hits is astonishing. Where's the ABBEY ROAD medley ""Golden Slumbers""/""Carry that Weight""/""The End""? Most of the songs here are excellent, but it's not worth it."
2,1967 - 70,"Probably the worst Beatles compilation ever....compiled.While the red album, focusing on the 1962-66 period is good except for some of the Revolver songs, this album focuses on the manufactured Sgt. Pepper / Magical Mystery Tour studio fare done in 1967, plus some of the bright spots thereafter. The red album, past masters, and even Beatles 1 are better."
4,fabulous four fan,I have all but two beatle albums. This one is nice because it has most of the hits you always remember the Beatles for in one cd. I keep this one in my car to jam on the interstate.
5,Beatles compilation Blue Album,"This double CD is a must for those who seek the best of the late 60's Beatles music. It has the cream of the crop from the White Album and great selections representative of all the top hits of that Beatles Era. If you want a collection without spending a fortune, this album is a must."
4,All Beatle alubums are good,"All Beatle albums are good.This album is not as good as the red album,but it is good enough to buy if your a beatles fan.There is alot of hits, but not as great as the red one."
5,Brilliant,"Here is a collection from the Beatles later years.Here is some sensational songs.There is so many number one hits here.Its good how they have split the earlier years and the second half of the Beatles 8 years at the top in half.These songs contain alot of studio mixing,and experimental ideas that took the world by storm.Its amazing where they dreamed up ideas for songs.There is alot of songs they could have put on here.Problem is i want to hear the whole of their albums when i hear a few songs from each.Precision is what the Beatles were all about."
3,A great compilation of Beatles songs!,"The blue album is a great compilation of Beatles songs from later in their career. It's got Strawberry Fields and Sgt. Pepper, two of their best!"
5,A raw exhibition of greatness,"One could conceivably create a better collection of songs than those assembled here, but such a collection would be too idealic to ever be realized in our less than perfect world. Suffice to say, this collection is astounding for how close it comes to such an ideal. It is inevitable that the die-hards amoung the Beatles fans will accept nothing short of the original LP's themselves, but everything has its place. Since the Beatles are no longer on the radio, other vehicles are necessary by which people can access the invaluable legacy the Fab Four endowed to this very grateful world. While I agree that this selection is in no way a replacement for the albums themselves, as a collection of music, it is both remarkable and useful. If you want to know why the Beatles are the greatest rock band of all time, this album provides a definitive answer."
3,Fab Four on Two Cd's?,"""The Beatles"" was quite possibly the best band ever assembled, therefore, the Blue Album only gives an overview of the engeinous minds of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. If you would like to do a justice to their talent, I suggest you buy the individual albums because they offer more of the timeless rock that will inspire audiences for hundreds of years in the future."
5,Fantastic album,"This album contains the best of the Beatles best years. Covering all the albums from Sgt. Pepper to Let It Be, this album is fantastic. All their #1s from the period are here, with all the classics. All four of them contributed to the album. This is a must buy for any BEatles fan."
5,Awesome Collection frrom the Greatest Band that Ever Was,"I urge this 2 disc set for anyone who has ever found themseves singing along with ""Hey Jude"" or ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" - this collection has it all. The beauty of the Beatles' later years is captured wonderfully in this set and you can see their progression, from the playful ""Penny Lane"" to the truly revolutionary ""Revolution"" (horrible pun - yes I know, but it works) on to the poetic ""Across the Universe"" and closing off with the last song they released as a group, the aptly-named ""Long and Winding Road."" Buy this for anyone who loves music.P.S. And for the person who said that they prefer Avril's music to this - you are truly a fool."
5,beatles,beatles thats all thats needed they made rock music. yes thier are bands i like better but come on everyone has to love the beatles
1,Missing CD,"Really bummed. My friend bought me the red and blue compilations for X-mas, and I just got around to opening them and loading them onto my ITunes. One of the CD's is missing in the Blue set, and now that we've JUST opened the sealed shrink-wrap, there's no way to return it.So, I guess if you order this set, make sure you open it right away and make sure that the CDs that you were supposed to get are actually in the package."
2,67-70,"With 12 of the 14 songs on Disc 1 being from the Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour period, this greatest hits package starts off pretty badly. It picks up with the more rock oriented hits from the While Album, but then fades quickly with songs that really aren't that good - Don't Let Me Down, Ballad of John & Yoko, Old Brown Shoe (this is a hit?), and Across the Universe. No reason to own this."
4,FEAR THE FILLER!!!,"In general, this has good selection. But there's some FILLER!!!Without further aideu, here is my version of the Blue Album, filler-lessDISC ONE:1. Penny Lane2. Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band3. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!4. When I'm Sixty-Four5. A Day in the Life6. Lovely Rita7. All You Need is Love8. I Am the Walrus9. Hello Goodbye10. Fool on the Hill11. Magical Mystery Tour12. Lady Madonna13. Hey Jude14. Revolution 1 (But that's just because I play sax and like the saxes)DISC TWO1. Back in the USSR2. While My Guitar Gently Weeps3. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da4. Get Back5. Don't Let Me Down6. Savoy Truffle7. Old Brown Shoe8. Here Comes the Sun9. Come Together10. Something11. You Never Give Me Your Money12. Let it Be13. One After 90914. Long and Winding Road (But the version on Let it Be Naked)Doesn't everybody agree?"
1,"The ""BLUE"" and ""RED"" of it all...","Being a big time Beatles fan since 1964. There is still no other band that gets as much play around my house. Great choice of songs here that any one would love to hear over and over again.The ""BLUE"" & ""RED"" albums are examples of stuff the record label was putting out. With no other reason except to offset the sales of Paul McCartney & John Lennon solo lp's. In their pitiful effort to force The Beatles back into reforming. (Along with lp's called, Rock and Roll Music & Love Songs) Notice they would always release them at the same time John or Paul had a new solo lp coming out.? Just buy the official Beatles cd's and all your dreams will come true, lol.You'll notice between the Blue & Red there are only 3 Harrison tunes and 2 Starr tunes."
1,"all filler, no killer","First, let it be said that biased people should not be allowed to review albums on Amazon (see July 19th). That said, even those Beatle fans with blind faith will admit that songs like ""Don't Let Me Down"", ""Ballad of John & Yoko"", ""Old Brown Shoe"" and ""Across the Universe"" are closer to the bottom of the heap than the top, and certainly should have been moved aside in favor of other tracks. Buy Abbey Road and even the sleep-inducing White Album if you must, but skip this unless you want a sampling of their worst work. 1-star."
1,"frankly, dismissable","Frankly this set of no-no tunes is dismissable. The lirrics are corny and sexist and immature.Why, this has been around too long.Evict and run from this.Thanxs"
5,WHO CARES ABOUT AVRIL WHATEVER HER NAME IS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"NUMBER 1 THE BEATLES DID NOT COPY ANYONE, AND NUMBER 2 THE BEATLES ARE A MILLION TIMES BETTER THEN ANY ARTISTS TODAY!!!!"
3,"Nice Listening,But Not Definitive","There is a lot that can be said for the blue and red Beatles compilations;they do highlight the major songs from the periods they represent,and the running order is both listenable and chronological. I owned this on vinyl when it was first released in the early seventies. Having bought all the individual albums on CD,I was reluctant to shell out the cash for this disc (the price is needlessly hefty for a two CD set although they did a great job with the re-mastering and booklet,it's still not a box set which it almost costs as much as).I got mine from the public library and copied it;you could also just make your own compilation tape/CD-R/Mini-Disc,just like this(although the sound here I believe is a little better than the discs that were mastered in the 80's,and the Yellow Submarine Songtrack is mastered even better) if you own the individual albums on CD,which everyone should."
2,Country Classics,"I saw this product being advertized on PBS. With the video clips, it appeared much better than just sitting listening to it. O.K, it's the kind of music my parents listened too a LOT when I was a kid and I just wanted a little trip down memory lane. If you're into older country (which has it's advantages), this is for you. Some of the songs are surprisingly humorous and ALL of them tell a story worth thinking about. I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, so I can't complaint too much. Volume TWO, in my opinion, is better... If not for Glen Campbell, however, I'd probably put it away for a rainey day... Glen was absolutely great. So, incidentally, was Merle Haggard. I surprised myself liking his voice so much..."
3,there're o.k.,For the price I got what I expected.For being on the bottom of the prices for the same type of tool I'm happy with them.
2,pedestrian,"basically, a crummy album. Taylor seems to be playing in some catatonic state, perhaps in an effort to give Coltrane more room. However, the astonishing individuality one associates with these two masters is strangely absent as neither seems willing to take any chances. Kenny Dorham comes out looking the best in this set. The second and third tracks are virtually identical adding to the banality of this strange session. great Francis Wolff cover shot of trane though."
2,"Shallow, misleading chapter titles","I read this book in the hope of discovering some words of wisdom regarding the marketing and development of software. Unfortunatley, the book contains very little business, selling or marketing advice that is specific to software, as opposed to any other industry.While the book talks at length about the process of developing, releasing and maintaining software, little of it is new or not obvious to anyone with even a couple of years experience in IT.Chapter eight, titled ""Programming without Tears"", has absolutely nothing about developing software, and instead has sections devoted to office politics, pay structures, and headhunters.The subject matter has great potential, but the book lacks insightful advice specific to the software industry."
5,One of the best!,"I have at least 50 books on the design and construction of furniture - this one is my favorite. I've made six projects from this book and the instructions are clear, dimensions accurate and the designs, while not very sophisticated, are well proportioned and great examples of country furniture. The section on finishing is particularly useful, covering milk paint, crackle finish and antiquing/distsressing. The corner cupboard and sofa tables which I built in highly figured woods, are wonderful pieces which I always get compliments on. I can't imagine why Rodale hasn't published it again. If you find, buy it!"
3,Very Nice Projects,"I have to agree with the reviewer about the dimensions - things don't always add up. But the projects are nice, you get a pretty good idea and since you are checking dimensions anyhow you can make modifications to personalize. I made two of the smaller items and they look great. The little history behind the items was interesting too."
4,Rethink and GO FORTH,"Distler's book is an amazing tool. As a teacher of Latin for many years now who has used the Grammar approach it wasn't always easy for me to buy in to what Distler had to say, however, the more I read, the more he convinced me. He lays out the goals, the plans and proceeds to tell the reader how to accomplish it. That's pretty amazing in itself. This fall I will be changing not only my text books, but my approach."
5,Must read by everyone concerned with the evils of ethnicity.,Superb description of the riots in Asia with obvious applications to the rest of the world. The associated analysis (while too heavy in sociological terminology) should be read by everyone concerned with the twin evils of ethnicity and religion.
4,Good soft jazz,"I had the pleasure of seeing Max Groove in Kansas City several months ago and was blown away by the live performance. Playing in a hotel bar, the trio were tight and inventive. The sound was soft jazz, but with a lot of high quality grooves from keyboards, bass and guitar. Max's brother in law played the Ibanez archtop (don't recall his name) and was outstanding. Very Pat Martino-like. Good CD."
4,Brilliant,"First heard Bob as one half of the Delevantes with his brother Mike.They produced two fine albums of great pop songs bristling with optimism and life.This album, Bobs second is simply a brilliant collection of songs that will put a smile on your face as you sing along."
3,"OK, but not worth 5 stars","I admit that I was captivated by this book. The first 400 pages I was hooked. The characters were interesting and the story was great. I kept waiting for her to tie all the characters together though and it never happened. It seemed that she had five different story lines going on that never really connected to each other. I definately could not put the book down and I rushed home from work every day to read it. Unfortunately, I was extremely extremely disappointed by the ending."
2,Excited but sad,"This was a kindle edition download. I was excited to start reading it. However, about 1% into the book, it was blank...nothing until 7% of the book. I have no idea what went on in the story. I even tried erasing it from Kindle and redownloaded it from amazon. Same thing happened.Looked like a great story, but I have no idea. :("
3,"Great christian references,","However, the characters are not believable. There are several stories going on in the book, but they don't connect or are not complete. (P.S. To the writer: America was founded on christian principles. Yes, maybe, but how could slavery happen?)"
2,Finally...,"A book that I can read over and over and over again and again and again and again. This is THE greatest book ever written!! Its content rivals that of the bible and the story is sheer genius. I can't wait until the movie comes out, I hope they potray the characters exactly the same way. I love this book and I wish some schools would start making this a required textbook instead of those EVILution books that make a mockery of my belief and all other christians. Buy the book and change your life."
3,For any L.A. Hard House fan!!!!,"For anybody who remembers the los angeles based record label Aqua boogie. This cd will bring back memories. This cd is mixed by dj Mijangos also featured in ""House of Harmony."" This cd is totally different then ""House of Harmony."" This cd is alot more energy driven. All songs are from the Aqua Boogie label and mixed decent. The first song is very nice, although the mix to track 2 kind of leaves you hanging. Songs 3 and 4 have great hard house energy (very nice). Songs 7 through 9 are also very good tracks. The mix has very good energy until song 10 through 12. These songs become more booty house, which is not bad, but kind of kills the energy of the mix. The cd then really does not gain its strength back until the last song.Good tracks: 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,16disapointing tracks:10,11,12,15overall rating 3.75"
5,GHARARDELLI Original Chocolate Cookbook,"This should be a ""must have"" for every chocoholic! The recipes are positively lucious, and it is easy to get the necessary Ghirardelli ingredients by phone, or online for those underprivileged who don't live near a Ghirardelli shop. CAUTION: Reading these recipes can definitely be fattening!"
3,Not as great as some would have you believe,"I bought a used copy of this book based on the reviews posted here, which lead me to believe Klein was as good as Shirley Jackson, H.P. Lovecraft, or Fritz Leiber. Well, he's not. Yes, he's literate and writes well, but his stories are bloated and meandering and you can always see exactly where they're going. On top of that, he has a tendency to cop out at the end and leave you hanging. Some people may like that, and it has its place, when done well, but Klein doesn't do it well, at least in these stories.That being said, the last of the four stories, Nadelman's God, is really good. Not scary, exactly (none of these stories are frightening), but original and well-imagined and nicely written. The ending... well... you be the judge."
3,"Lots of buildup, small payoff","Heard about this book through a friend and found it online. Four stories, they were about as scary to me as Hansel and Gretel. A great deal of buildup, and then the ending with the ""scary"" part. Kind of meh."
2,Blonde NOT Red,"Pro-Smelled goodCons-Color Did not turn out red at all! My hair is now just Blonde, and less red from when I dyed it. Does not match the box at all."
5,Step into a time past with this touching story,"Adopted Jane has been enjoyed by 2 generations of our family; myself as a 9 year old (well over 30 years ago!) and now by our 10 year old daughter. She is totally engrossed in the unfolding of Jane's story.Adopted Jane is one of those ageless, character filled books that you just don't forget. Daringer writes of an era, and the prejudice that exsisted towards orphans, from an age past.It's an excellent book for narration, if you home educate, and discussion - we were able to compare the adoption of a loved family member in more modern times with the process and feelings detailed in Adopted Jane.Jane's character shines through out the book and excels with the difficult end choice she must make; which home to be adopted into?If your young reader has enjoyed Understood Betsy, or Anne of Green Gables, there's a good chance that this book will resonate with them too."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered the 40 foot leash expecting a nylon leash (flat, manageable). I received a 40 foot nylon rope, more like a clothes line. This is very hard to hold on to, and sharp. I have dropped the cord numerous times because it has cut my hands/fingersI was looking for a long nylon leash to be able to take my dog hiking, and swimming because he has been able to break the cotton leashes.This product does not work for us, simply because I cannot hold the rope without getting hurt. On the rare occasion that we do use it, I clip a short leash to the handle for me to hold.So if what you are looking for is a 40 ft rope with a loop and a buckle, this product will fit your description."
5,trust me on this one...,"This is quite an amazing cd. I'm not one for labeling music, so i'll just say it's just music that can get you high. I feel a dizzying state overcome me when i listen to this band. The group consists of 2 brothers from Texas, i believe. One does the music while the other does the vocals. The music is quite textured, kind of drags your soul about in a sweet way. Electro-ish beats with crazy efx and sampling, quite spooky and haunting at times. The vox go from distorted skinny puppy/ministy-ish to sweet, gloomy serenades. I've yet to meet anyone who has heard this band, they appear to be highly under-rated, but trust me and get this one..."
3,Middle of the Road Amp,"This amp is driving 4 Infinity Infinity Kappa 682.7CF speakers. The head unit is a kenwood KFC-332. At low to mid volume sound is crisp and clean. However, from 80% volume and up the sound quality deteriorates. The vehicle in which the system was installed was recently in a parade and after an hour of the system at 80% power, the amp overheated and shut down. Noted problems could be due to speakers drawing 2oms, but the amp advertizes to be able to handle it."
4,Mule Bluegrass?!?! Hell yeah!,"Saw a copy of this CD, battered, bruised and very unbuyable at a Sam Goody in Washington, DC just before the Mule show at the 9:30 club on the 27th of October. Shoulda picked it up anyway, because that night the band was playing it before they went on! It sounded great, and was a fantastic lead-in to the show, which was great too. I can't think of a better way to please the majority of people at our family get-togethers than by breaking this CD out; for us Muleys, we get our fix without having to listen to the parents and grandparents and other older ""More decent folk"" make snippy comments about the ""loud noise... aint music!""Besides, the playing is awesome. Let's face it, it would HAVE to be in order for it to be a proper Mule tribute. The songs are well picked (no pun intended) and are melodious, foot stompin' fun. If you enjoy Gov't Mule, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed."
4,"10 fer 2, john sinclair","very informative piece of history,i did not know much about the white panthers and the political reasons for chasing after john. a well done doc,perhaps someday the laws will change and we can welcome him back to the usa."
3,Pretty good documentary.,"A good overall history of John Sinclair. Some good footage as well. Not terrible not amazing. Would like more old footage...interviews and less new ones, I guess."
2,Dave Aranda-Richards only true actor in this video,"Very good special effects, but mediocre acting. Only true professional appears to be Governor Quincy played by Dave Aranda-Richards, and the so-called director kills him off and the acting then gets ridicoulsly bad."
1,How I wasted 2 hours of my day.,"Totally stupid...........I wanted to see more of Athena Massey but there were only a few shots of her. And she gets killed during a fight with a gun, she never handily beats somebody. BOOO!"
5,Lots of crashes,Movie has lots of crashes which may appeal to those who like action movies.Has technology that is forward looking in the movie.
2,"Be warned!! once read, it's a throw away.","If you are consider buying this book, you might as well buy it, look it and give it somebody else for Christmas.I would Strongly recommend you go to an actual bookshop ,read it quickly and judge it from there.This may not be suitable for your camera!Overall the Hacking Digital Cameras idea is pretty sketchy and has a limited range of camera models ,you better use the internet instead."
5,batteries not included,"I started reading this book four weeks ago and have improved my photography skills considerably, regarding what settings to use, how best to work with wide angle lenses, whether I'm hiking in the woods or eating at a restaurant. I'm just an amateur but this book is definitely a sound investment and will really make your digital camera work for you."
3,Class Requirement,This book was required as a class read. It provided the necessary background and information as desired. Not a book recommended for normal reading.
1,Molly 'N Me Glitzy Flower Clock For Those Who Can't Tell Time,Product was given as a Christmas gift and didn't work! No instructions or paperwork accompanied product which would allow for it's return. What a disappointment and a waste of a good deal of money for a simple alarm clock. Would never trust this seller again!!!!!!
5,My Daughter Loved It,"My daughter is 18 and, to our amazement, speaks French. Fluently. She has been studying French at the University of Tennessee since she was sixteen because there were no more courses at her high school which she could take. She told me she wanted this French Magnetic Poetry Kit for Christmas and was thrilled to unpack the 500 French words in it. She even took some really lovely pictures of the piles of words and put them on her Facebook page. We have no idea what she will be spelling, but then we usually don't know what she is saying either."
4,See below,"I am using this book for the prepration of the methadology of my MBA theseis, i think it is a good book, however i am discovering it is beter to have more than one good source, is this obvious for methadology writing ?, i don't know."
4,Recomended to all business students,I do recomend this book to all business students who are doing any kind of research. Special recommendations to ACCA students who are doing the Oxford-Brookes Research and Analsys Project.All chapters are relevant.
5,Don't let this be the end,"Yet another enjoyable book set in the universe of Mutineers Moon. The kids are growing up and off on their midshipmen cruise but somebody wants them dead, and eventually their parents as well. This well written 3rd novel keeps you engrossed in the two not so divergent story lines. How someone from earth wants the throne that Colin holds and will go to any lengths and kill millions of people to get it. Also the story of Harriet and Sean as they are shipwrecked on an primitive theocratic planet and have to win it over to be able to go home again. A must read. I just hope there is one more to come."
4,Pretty Good,"This book was humorous while still being informative. It is still dry at times, but does a much better job with keeping interest than any other technical writing book that I have read. Would definitely recommend this book for the aspiring/practicing engineer as I am keeping this one on the bookcase."
1,Flabbergasted,"I bought this book in hopes of finally knowing of the original stories that inspired the famous tales we know today.The frase ""curiosity killed the cat""showed itself here for it was written with sexual ideas. Any thing thought by the reviewer to hint at sex drastically changed the story to an adulterized ""original"" version. Maybe it is my unwillingnes to accept the stories be that way, but we are all hinting here for nobody not even the reviewer know the real story.We are then just reading someone's opinion of how the stories were. If you agree with him/her all is fine but I am one of the idea that nothing here is truth.Though it sounds convincing at first you might then notice how the reviewer supposes,guesses and comes to conclusions that I ,as might you,find offensive."
5,An incomparable resource for anti-racist media activists!,"For media activists interested in issues of racial equality, ""Talking the Walk"" is an essential tool for disrupting racist media stereotypes and democratizing the news. By combining critical social analysis with communication guidelines, case studies, and sample materials, this easy-to-use resource will help you reframe public debate on crucial topics like police brutality, immigration, and environmental racism. Though challenging the right-wing corporate media's economic and political offensive against communities of color is admittedly a daunting task, the authors of this important book are optimistic that grassroots groups can successfully change public policy by becoming media watch-dogs and developing grassroots alternative media."
4,Excellent book - few minor nitpicks,"There are least 2 million books discussing, mapping, and diagraming everything that the left (fret) hand does while playing. However, my biggest weakness was what to do with my right hand - something that would make the chord changes a little more interesting than V V V VThis book was a tremendous help as far as developing a struming toolkit that actually made all those vanilla chord changes sound a lot more like ""music"". My only nitpick is that the included CD had ""background"" insturments, in addition to the guitarist - which in some cases made it difficult to pick out the nuances of the strumming/picking patterns. But that it is a minor problem with this otherwise outstanding book - one that has made a enormously positive impact on my playing."
5,No complaints,"I bought this twine to use as a measuring string for shooting, and also hanging targets. Good, cheap and strong, no complaints with the quality. This is my second purchase of this twine for these purposes."
1,Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.,"Have to agree with other negative reviews. Winced visibly upon listening. Attempts to ""get it"" by engaging in repeated listenings just brought further punishment-- even copping my most ""avant-garde"" attitude, I could not hear anything compelling on this disc. It was a mistake buying this disc that I will...Blame on My Youth...For an antidote, go buy Jane Monheit's disc with this title track on it."
1,One of the dullest albums I've ever heard,"I picked this album up used, mainly because of ""Purple Avenue"" (originally done by Tom Waits). I was sorely disappointed with this CD. It had absolutely no feel, no flavor. Since I couldn't return it, it is now serving as a coaster. It's probably tied with Metallica's St. Anger album for being the worst in my collection."
2,too long and too boring,"Ok this cd had nicely written songs, but they just didn't sound full. They were too long, too boring...not enought pep to them! This cd was so boring it made me want to fall asleep! Your best bet is Holly's latest stuff...a huge improvement over this boring crap!"
3,Good but not enough action! A bit confusion! Movie could have been way better!,"This movie was kind of so-so! Not enough action! It really dose not excite me! I watch this one time a long time ago when I was at Florida during my graduation trip. I did not think this movie would be any good when I watch this the second time. No wonder this movie went straight to video instead of the theaters. Instead of me ordering this movie, they should have run this movie on HBO or Showtime channels or something! I should have giving this movie 2 stars! But like I said this movie is just alright to me!Dee SmallsDecatur,GA."
2,Pretty awful,"I'm sorry, but I thought this movie was pretty awful. In my opinion the only reason to see it is to see Annie Wood (of Bzzz! fame) topless."
2,Stay away,"I tried to use this with Ableton, and it only records in mono. The cord itself is very cheaply made and the sound quality is just average to below average. What's more, the built-in preamp is weak, and the volume is extremely quiet. The volume might be acceptable for voice recording, but for instruments it's really bad. Overall: don't buy. I'm going to try to take mine back."
3,USB to XLR,"LightSnake STUSBXLR10 LightSnake USB Microphone cableThe first thing I did was plug this into my computer and fired up Adobe Audition to record my weekly podcast. The Light snake didn't seem to have any driver issues according to Windows XP, but when plugged in, my computer started sending sound out the cable instead of my headphones (i could tell because the lights on the cable were blinking). After fixing that problem I still cannot get windows or Audition to let me record through the cable from an SM58. I'm going to plug it into my Mac and I'm sure it'll work better but the 'simple plug and play' label may not be applicable depending on your computer and software setup."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH ROCK BAND 2,"Some liar on here sold me on this. He had to be lying because this only works with a driver that is not found by rock band 2. This product may work fine with basic audio computer stuff, but DO NOT BUY for Rock band 2."
4,Great for the price,"This leaves (almost) no hum or background noise and how it lights up is pretty cool. It's great for its price and my only concern is that once plugged into the computer, playback sound is impossible (even with headphones plugged in)."
4,Works great for what it is....in inexpensive alternative,"I have no complaints about this product, the first one I purchased was defective, however Amazon promptly exchanged it for one that was working properly. I use this cable with an old Shure SM-57 for recording acoustic guitar. Excellent for the home hobbyist. I will probably purchase another one down the road just to have more recording options."
1,Barely Functional,"When I first got this I expected it to be just as easy as it says. Just plug it in, and bam you're recording your microphone.That's not the case at all. As the other reviewer said, when you plug it in it gives a ""USB Not Recognized"" error. Unlike him, however, I'm using Windows 7 not XP. I did get it to work eventually, but here's the thing: it wasn't from their stupid driver CD they included.That CD only works for Windows 98 of all things. Really? You're still including this CD and you CLAIM right in the description that this works for all versions of Windows. Outrageous.I DID eventually get it working, but:So I read online that you can make it work by turning on the computer with the USB already plugged in. Yeah, it worked. The light turned on. My microphone was working at okay quality even.ONE WEEK LATER. That trick doesn't work any more. The USB never lights up. I tried it in every USB slot. It's trash. Don't buy it. Unbelievable."
5,Just a question,Before I ordered this I just wanted to know if this cable works for the auto technica AT2020 because I just recently bought the microphone and it didn't come with a cable I'd be glad if someone would respond to this as soon as possible Thanks!
3,"Great quality item, but has a buzz.","I was really impressed with this product when I got it. The quality is so much better than I expected. This is not the type of cable that will easily break. It is plug and play for Mac, and has a CD for Windows-based machines.Unfortunately, when I use it with my Mac, I get some serious buzz in the background - so much so that I stopped recording with it. I am not sure what the problem is, but the buzz is loud enough to be annoying.Good quality cable if you want to give it a shot. The buzz could be how it talks to my computer and you may not have the same problem. It could also be my mic."
1,May not be recognized,"This product seems to work on some machines but not all. On an XP w/sp3, the system does not recognize the device and asks for the location of a device driver. Of course this is not available and SoundTech Tech claims that they do not know what device driver the cable uses. They also claim that they cannot find out what device driver is needed as they do not manufacture the Lightsnake, and they do not have authority to contact the OEM. After searching the Internet, it appears that I am not alone with this problem, but SoundTech actually told me to call Microsoft to find the device driver. Not much help here as Soundtech cannot tell me what device driver I should be looking for. Maybe the worst tech support I have experienced in my 30+ years in the IT industry!"
4,PS3 with Rock Band 2,"The lightsnake does work with the PS3 with Rock Band 2. I already had a Shure SM58 XLR mic and needed a replacement for the original RB mic so I tried this. To make it work in RB, I had to go to the PS3 menu (outside of RB) and go to the Settings -> Accessory Settings -> Audio Device Settings. I set the Microphone level to 5 and the input device to USB Device, then OK to save settings (not back button).The volume is fairly low in RB. I turned up the mic sensitivity and the volume all the way and it is adequate."
5,Good Blues,"Mark Hummel is one of my favorite blues artists. If you like rocking harp, you'll like this."
3,An early Wambaugh book,"I am a fan of Wambaugh's later books but this one was an introspective, slow-moving tale of a cop's last 3 days before retirement during which nothing very exciting happens. It takes place in the 70's and gives you a real sense of that time and how policing has changed since. Reading the many descriptions of the grossly huge amounts of food he eats as he goes through his day was enough to give me indigestion. Although I did manage to finish the book, every time I picked it up I wondered why I was bothering."
5,Snow/Snow 2: Brain Freeze,Snow / Snow 2: Brain Freeze are both really cute family fun Christmas Films. Really enjoyed them both!!! Even my older daughter age 28 enjoyed these two movies.
5,Snow/Snow2: Brain Freeze,Great and wonderful movie for families to watch. Very heart warming and the actors/actresses are great.
5,Snow/Show 2: Brain Freeze,"Loves these movies, though the Santa Claus doesn't fit the description usually associated with the traditional Santa Claus the movies are enjoyable."
3,Crunchy strong and ok taste,"I thought the pocket coffee was good, not sure I'll order them again though. It definitely has a coffee flavor and is a strong flavor, has a little bit of a crunch to it, but it's also has a bitter after taste which might be reason it's not what I expected."
5,Another Wow!,"I visited Italy last year and bought this because it looked yummy. All I can say is ""wow!!!"" I was craving it when I got back home. When I was in Italy and was watching tv at night, this was advertised like Snickers is here. It's a piece of chocolate with espresso inside! And not a creamy espresso....oh no....it's a liquid center and will dribble out of your mouth if you chew with your mouth open."
5,Ketostix Reagent Strips,This brand is reliable. There are cheaper brands out there but you will get very mixed results. Package was sealed well and not expired.
2,EXPENSIVE!,"I don't know much about using these for diabetes management, but if you are using these for Atkins' dieting (ketosis) hurry on down to WalMart and buy the Relion brand for less than seven dollars and NO S&H."
5,"Easy to use, very accurate","I used this product before starting Atkins and the colors (easily discernable) that showed indicated ""negative"" ketoacidosis which is normal for those not on a low-carb diet. However, after the first week, I used another strip and it clearly showed moderate ketoacidosis which gave me the mentality that the diet I am on was working for my body. This is a very helpful tool for those on a low-carb diet. Even after a weekend of cheating on the diet and drinking beers, I immediately used the strips and it had showed my levels back to negative. This is very useful.There is a 6 month expiration date with 50 strips so I would recommend using 2 strips a week for 6 months. This will also help you make sure you're on track with whatever low-carb diet you are on."
1,I wouldn't buy them again,"Well I started Atkins diet and kept reading all of these posts about people using the strips but first of all I'm not really sure they are working properly. They always turned the exact same color (same shade, etc) no matter what I ate. I think they ended up causing me to be using them all of the time trying to see if I ever got a different response but don't feel they actually helped me and actually made the diet worse because I kept doubting it..."
2,For Atkins diet,"These where not helpful at all, they didn't show hardly any ketones even though i was loosing weight... waste of money if your tracking/going into a deep ketosis state."
3,this is an o.k story,i have to do Macbeth in English at the moment.I think it is a very powerful story but some of the language i don't understand at all and that makes it kinda hard to follow.
3,Macbeth,"Macbeth is not one of my favorite Shakespeare titles. Period. The notes helped me get thru my class, tho."
2,Only one good song here,"""Life is a highway"" is killer! The rest is not even close to the quality or festive context. Just download the mp3"
5,Exceptional,"My second-favorite FLA song (other than 'Millenium') is Comatose, so this single definitely satisfies me. The two FLA remixes differ only slightly from the original, and the Eatstatic RMX is very cool, yet repetitive and hopelessly different from the original, but the track 'Oblivion' is incredibly good and, like the whole FLAvour of the Weak, has some cool core samples from one of my favorite movies, 'Hellraiser: Bloodline.'I highly recommend this single."
3,remodeling time,"This collection showcases remixes from haujobb's first 2 full length cd's, homes & gardens and Freeze Frame Reality. Here is where haujobb really starts to change and gain the spacy abstract sonund they're now known for. Standout tracks include the remixes of Dream Aid and Eye Over You, but the disc is marred by 2 mixes of Cold Comfort, my least favorite haujobb song.Definiely worth buying, but get Solutions For A Small Planet and Freeze Frame Reality first."
3,"239705-001 Equivalent Replacement AC Adapter For Compaq / HP New,","The adapter works but does not have a 90 degree plug as shown on the photo, the plug is straight."
5,Not a knock off brand!!!,"Do your research before posting reviews. Please note, Bayer was bought out by Siemens, and the label on the bottle will reflect this. I'm in no way linked to the company, just a long term T1DM that uses these strips daily. Their straight from Bayer or should I say Siemens, the same company!"
3,NOT BAYER PRODUCT / GENERIC BRAND,"AMAZON SHOWS A PACKAGE CLEARLY MARKED ""BAYER"" AT THE TOP OF THE BOX, BUT WHAT YOU GET IS A GENERIC AUSTRALIAN PRODUCT.BOX IS MARKED ""FOR USE IN ASIA PACIFIC""$35 AND GOT AN OFF BRAND??"
3,Be sure to order from a reputable seller - some sellers are shipping generics and/or expired product.,"It appears the confusion on this particular product stems from if purchases from a reputable supplier or if purchased by a less reputable supplier. Buyer beware when selecting which company to purchase from / ship these test strips. Also be cautious about expiration dates on packages received, again, be sure to select a reputable seller.... Please be sure to report disreputable sellers who are not responsive to inquiries for customer service.In the meantime, the Bayer / Seimens test strips are very accurate. I rate this product as 3 stars simply over the obvious confusion when ordering as well as the fact there are other very accurate test strips being sold here on Amazon for about 1/3 the going rate for these Bayer/ Seimen test strips, and without the frustration of being sent a different brand or expired product. Buyer beware."
1,didn't get what i ordered,I ordered Bayer and got a generic brand. the picture is misleading and appears to be Bayer until you receive it. It is hard to know how to return their products
2,An Okay Tank......,"My main issue is this that is comes with a filter that is too big for the tank and the hood will not go on properly. Any sort of of fish that jumps could be in danger in this tank due to a small opening in the back. I've only had this tank for a few weeks but I definately will buy a new, smaller filter soon, other wise the fish I keep in there are fine and the tank is adequate for a few small fish."
1,DANGER - BEWARE,"I purchased this product in December as a gift for my 3 year old. Last week the pump sucked up our Betta, Henry. I immediatley turned it off thinking it would release him, it didn't. My husband had to physically pull Henry out of the pump. He is still alive for now, however, he is missing alot of parts. This was barbaric. The product recommends Betta's, so why did this happen????"
1,Acrylic started cracking in less than a year,"Purchased one of these for my wife so she could enjoy having two betas (divider is included in this package). At less than one year we started noticing some leakage from this aquarium. It first started at the base, then there were small cracks appearing on the side and front. The aquarium was never hit or knocked around. I can only say ""stay away from this aquarium."" I've got an Eclipse System 3 on order which should be a much better replacement as I have one of the 12 gallon versions which are outstanding in regards to filtration."
4,Product does not match picture,"The product I received was very similar but not identical to the product pictured. The actual product has glass which is quite frosted and you are unable to see through the lantern. The interior also does not look like a candle, but this is not normally visible due to the frosted glass. The product is very similar, but for my purposes, I would have preferred clear glass as pictured."
2,The songs all sound alike,"I've been a huge fan of TFF since The Hurting. I expected to hear at least some of the variety of hallmark sounds and rhythms they made carry over into this CD, being that it bears the name of one-half of the creative talent. I was sadly disappointed. The same guitar sound and beat (when there is one) is found song after song, with no variety and seemingly very little artistic ""recklessness"" so characteristic of Mr. Mayfield's previous endeavors with TFF. I've got nothing against acoustic/electric guitar music, but I would have preferred to spend the money on a ""single"" and listen to it over and over again."
5,MOOG Suspension Parts,"After searching the net, AMAZON had the part, IN STOCK, at the best price and FREE shipping! Excellent deal that I cam back and purchased a second set!"
5,The truth about the Air War of WWI,"Although little is written of the truth to the Air War in WWI, it is often offered to history as a time of chivalry amoungst the ""Upper Class Gentleman"" of WWI. Most sucessful pilots, that being anymore that 5 kills, were showered with metals and given the highest honors from their fatherlands. Deeming them, The Knights of The Skies. The truth is far from reality. This book of one young man's personal, daily recolection in it's original, unaltered text, depicts the Air War as it really was. Not only can you feel the excitement and astonishment in his mind as he earns his wings in flight school, you also experience the sadness and despair as he watches his squadmates perish and learns the veracity of war and death. Illustrated by Clayton Knight, whose sketches and paintings went on to become famous after the war, this book is a must for anyone who is interested in the true reality of The Air War of WWI."
4,why don't they identify the author?,"It was obvious from the wealth of information of those who served with the author that the identity is known. Why not disclose who wrote the diary? We share the experiences. We watch the aviator transform from a fun loving barn stormer to a machine that can only function when airborne. The end comes and you know it is coming, the author is crumbling, his attitude has changed, he operates by reflex and his judgement is impaired. (not by booze but battle fatigue has taken over} This is too real . . ."
1,Amateur packing,This breakable carafe was shipped without proper safeguards and arrived broken. The item was lose in the box and the 'air bags' were deflated and insufficient for the job. I wouldn't order another...
2,I'm sure it is great,"We bought this Carafe as a gift for our Sister-in-law. It's a very nice looking item, I'm sure it keeps beverages hot for a good while. However, we have not received one intact. Our first shipment came with the carafe wrapped in bubble-wrap that was flat, in a box filled with Fill-air that had migrated to the sides, and a shattered carafe. We filed for a return and, as a joke, gave the shattered carafe to our sis-in-law (blamed the kids for dropping it). The next day we received the replacement item. They realized that the bubble wrap was useless, so they didn't bother with it at all. This time one of the feet is broken. Hopefully, third time is a charm with shipping and it will be packaged properly. Sorry that I can't provide a better review for the actual carafe."
4,Works well and nice looking,"I have only used the carafe a couple of times, but both times it worked great. I bought 2 of these one white one black for water & coffee. At the end of the 3 hour meeting the water was still cold and the coffee still hot. Not much else to say, they work well and look nice."
3,ABCs says it all,"I found the book OK as a primer, but it wasted time on some very obvious points. Also, it was not too clear on the differences between self settled trusts and third party trusts. Not a bad place to start if you have no background, but I would have preferred something more in depth. A few of the Hints were helpful.The book is set up to sell stuff so you can do your own plan, documents, etc., but you did not get the info you really need to pull that off. I would recomend The Special Needs Trust Administration Manual as more comprehensive and the same length."

1,Outdated source,Back in it's day this book was one of few books that catered to Civil War uniforms. At this date the book would best serve the owner as a doorstop. If you're looking for a book that shows accurate reconstructions of Civil War uniforms this will not fit the bill. There are too many inaccuracies in this book to list. ~Gary
4,"I thought this book was full of suspense and emotions,",The author really makes you keep the book in your hands at all times. The story is based on a girl that is the only person left in a nuclear war. So she thinks. Then one day she notices a camp fire getting closer and closer. Who is it? What do they want? Are they friendly? All of these questions make the book very suspensful. The things that happen make you angry and sad. You really feel your a part of the story and that is enough for me to promote Z for Zachariah!
4,Alone With Zachariah: Tabitha,"I rated this book a four star because the book is about a girl left in the middle of the affects from a nuclear holocaust. With a book that has twists, turns, and loops, it straps you to the end of your seat. If you like unpredictable, Z for Zachariah is for you. Ann Burden, the only one left, has to survive, unless the man in the suit can't be trusted. She, Ann Burden, must get through the nuclear holocaust for the world. Ann's reoccurring haunting dream, sets an eerie feeling throughout the novel. This eerie mood seems to stalk the novel. If you don't like eerie and creepy, this book would not be good for you. ""Twisted ending with a touch of suspense,"" said my fellow peer. ""A book with twists, turns, trust, love, eerie-ness, and a nuclear holocaust, no wonder!"""
1,B for Bad,"This is a book in diary format about a young girl named Ann Burden. Ann is the only person left in her area because of a war that killed her friends and family. As boring day goes on to boring day, there is nothing new until Jack Loomis arrives in the valley Ann calls home.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone with refined reading tastes. The plot is too bland making the whole book dry. You cannot relate to the characters, unless you are a psychopath or a sixteen-year-old orphan who lives on a farm. If you happen to like monotonous and idiotic stories, feel free to read Z for Zachariah."
1,Not what it lives up to be,"When I read the first chapter of this book, I had a feeling that it would be filed with surprise, susupense, and intrigue. But what I really found out was that the pages contained a dull, repetitive storyline, boring charaters, and a atmosphere of pain. I guess the saying ""you can't judge a book by it's cover"" is in good use here."
1,"Depressing, even disturbing.","Z for Zachariah is a depressing novel, even a disturbing one. Ann is forced into a life of solitude by circumstances. Even when the man, Mr. Loomis, entered the valley, she received little companionship, just pain and suffering for the most part. One interpretation might be that Mr. Loomis forced her out of the valley so she would seek others and procreate her species because he believed there were others after seeing the birds. But even with the protagonist professing hope at the end, there is no guarantee of finding other life. Even an optomistic reader must agree that hardship is certain and survival uncertain.The title Z for Zachariah would not indicate hope if it refers to her Bible alphabet and her belief that Z for Zachariah stood for the last man."
1,I hate this book!!,"The guy is a control freak and the girl is a self centered brat. I hate both of the characters and there are only 2 in the whole book. I would have given this 0 stars, but the computer wouldn't let me. I hate this book."
3,Eh..I wouldn't read it AGAIN,"Z for Zachariah was a very well written book, I found it boring most times but it was well written. The author described living conditions quite well and showed us exactly what it was like to live and survive completely alone...I liked how it went into detail about Ann and what she has survived. But the one thing I could not undertstand was how she could be defeated so easily by Loomis, when she had gone through so much already. I liked the book, but the reason I wouldn't read it again would be because I don't like sad endings...and yeah, she says she has hope but I still think it is sad.I also would've shot Loomis straight in the head if I were Ann...BW~"
5,Z for Zachariah is the coolest book out there,"I thought that the book was going to be ok, but when I read it I found out that it was the best book that I have ever read.I will pass this book on to my kids ,and hopfully they will pass them to thier kids to. ENJOY READING THIS WONDERFUL BOOK!"
2,Second reading was a flop!,"I don't know what happened. I read this book about 3 years ago, and thought it was one of the best, most exciting books I'd ever read. So, a few days ago, I went to the library and checked it out to read it again. I started reading ... and fell asleep! What a snooze-fest! The descriptions were tedious, and in some instances, hard to visualize. I really didn't like Ann Burden at all, in fact. I didn't even finish it. I just got fed up with the way-off-base characters and boring farm description. In conclusion, read it if you're in the 9-12 age group, but beware, it doesn't hold up in a second reading."
2,Okay book,This book did not satisfy my reading requirements for when I read books. I thought the language and writing was to plain and the events were exciting but they came out boring because they were so undescriptive. The book ahd a good plot but the characters seemed less real. Ann seemed a little to mature and smart for being only 16 years old and it seemed kind of weird that the only other person living was Mr. Loomis who was a bad man. I believe that the book had a good start but the writing was just not enough and caused me to become bored of the book part way through.
2,Different kind of review than most others,"This book did not satisfy my reading requirements for when I read books. I thought the language of this book was very plain and although the events were thrillers when you look back at them, they came out more boring and very undescriptive. The book had a good plot but the characters seemed less real. Ann seemed too mature for being ONLY 15 years old and it seemed like a weird coincidence that Mr. Loomis wasnt a good man and was the only other human being they knew of alive. I believe that the book had a good start but the writing was just not enough and caused me to get very bored of the reading."
4,We want a sequel,The ending upset us. We want to know what happened to Ann later. Is there a sequel? How about information on Robert C. O'Brien? We are Sixth Graders that just finished the book in class. We liked it overall.
3,"A good, suspenseful book","I read ""Z for Zachariah"" for a school novel that our teacher recommended. The book started off a bit slow for me, but as I read on It got a bit more interesting because i wanted to find out what would happen next. I reccomend this book to all ages from about 11 to 40."
2,"Gripping story line, yet content laked in quality.","This story had a lot more potenial, because I felt it built to anti-climax, in nearly every chapter. For instance in one chapter it started like this:- ""I am in terrible trouble. Mr Loomis shot me."" The author takes two more chapters till they desribe what happened. By the time I got to the part of the shooting, it had kind of lost it's ability to capture my attention.If the book had got to the point a lot quicker I would have classified this book in an above average range."
2,this book was alright,I thought that the beginning of this book was dull and stupid. Yet so far I havent finished it but as I see it now it is very suspensful and alright.
2,Z for Zachariah,"I found that this book, although thrilling and suspensful, was quite boring to sum it up in one word. The good parts were about 5 of the 30 odd chapters. Most of it was telling us that she was diging in the garden. There were a few good surprises though, so if you enjoy a heart-gripping sci-fi, go out and read Z for Zachariah."
2,Z for Zachariah,"This book is extreemly slow and is too imature and is quite a good book for begginers.It has only two characters.It is about a girl left alone in a vally, which has its own wheather, after a terrible nuciar explosion which killed everbody. Untill she meets this guy who is an isane man who wants her to be his slave. He also tries to [physically attack} her."
1,Save Your Money,"As a 6th grade honors English student, I had to read this book. I disliked it mainly because the heroine, Ann, needs to get a backbone. After nursing a horrible murderer back to health and then being shot by the very same person would drive me crazy. The first part of the book is terribly boring, and once the real action starts you can't relate the book to real life. The end leaves you hanging - if you can call it an ending! The rest of my class has the same opinions, and now we have to go through this torture again: we have to re-read it for a final exam! I personally (and heed these words) am considering an F as opposed to re-reading this excuse for a novel. So take the advice of a kid and save your money."
1,T for terrible,"Z for Zachariah tells of Ann Burdens conflict with the dominating John Loomis. They are most likely the last people on earth, due to a nuclear war. John has a safe suit that can protect him from radioactivity, and he wil kill to keep it. He is very controlling, and tries to control everything, including Ann. This book was very boring for me, the ending was a bit more unprdictable, but how the characters acted didn't make much sense. The whole book was supposed to be suspenseful, but the tone and style used by the author (no foreshadowing, or figurative language) made it very boring. Maybe the ending was better because Rober C O'Briens's wife finished the book after he died. This book could have been much better if the writing wasn't so simple. Bottom line is, this book is terrible, the whole book was a death rattle, ending in rigor mortis for the author (both literally and figuratively). A bunch of monkeys could have written it better."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!,"I had to read this book 2 times when I was in school. Once in the 8th grade and again in the 9th grade. I think it was just a coincidence that my teachers selected the same books, but it was not a problem with me.I honestly admit that I stole a copy from my school in the 11th grade (someone just left it laying around) and I've read the book over and over again. I know that it's a pretty morbid storyline, but in all honesty I just can't express how valuable this book was to me as a young woman and into my adult life."
3,Z for Zachariah- (don't let the title fool you),"Z for Zachariah is a very interseting book. It makes you want to keep reading. The beginning starts off slow but then after the first Five or so chapters it gradually gets better and better. However, the ending is surprisingly easy to guess what happens. But it still holds your attention because it's well written. The only thing I think is a little awkward is the stupiness of the main character, but that's just my opinion. Still it is a magnificently written book and I would advise you to read it."
4,Couldn't put it down!!!!,"i, too, was required to read this book for 7th grade. At first, i did NOT get into it. i dont like sci-fi very much, and the idea of nuclear bombs scare me. but after a couple chpters, i started to really enjoy it!. I could connect with ann, and found the book very very very suspensful. I think i read it in one night. I did not so much like the ending, because it left the book too open.all in all, it was a great book, and i now have better thoughts on sci-fi!"
4,This book is suitable for readers from young adults on up.,"This book is one that you will not regret reading. I found that once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I read it in highschool and again in an adolescent literature class at the University of Central Florida. I was excited to read it again. The strength that is shown by Ann, the heroine, is unreal. I reccommend this book for everyone! Michael P. Novell"
4,Thought provoking.,"I remember reading this story in high-school years ago, andIfound it again at the used bookstore. I found it morethought provoking and touching when I reread it as an adult.I am stillamazed at the strength of the heroine. The storyholds up even aftertwenty years, and would entertain youngadult readers today.Kelly Macsisak"
3,My Book Review,"I liked it, but it was slow going and not enough action. The idea was good but the length without excitement was very dull. If you are a patient reader then you would probably like this book, however if you are like me you like a lot of action right away once you start the book. I compared this book to the book THE OUTSIDERS. I gave the book a 5, I loved the outsiders because it had a lot more detail and action,(not that Z for Zacariah was a bad book). Overall I give this book a 2 rating but as a different reader and person you might think differently."
5,This was my favorite book.,I read this book over 15 years ago and I still think about it. It makes you think what could happen. I recommend this book for everyone over the age of 12!
3,interesting,It's been a long time since I read this but I recall that Iread it through in one sitting because it got my interest.
5,The images stick with you,I read this book while staying in the hospital with my daughter. I found it in their library. I have read many books that are written for children and teens and this is one of those that has really made an impression on me. A good book like this leaves images in my mind that make me feel as though I actually saw the events happening. I can just 'see' the guy chasing the girl all over that valley! The storyline was interesting and the characters well-developed. The action kept me turning the pages. I do enjoy post-apocalyptic storie and this is one of the best ones I've read. Highly recommended. There is one part that makes me hesitate to recommend it to younger readers. The girl is almost raped by the guy and there is some discussion about keeping the human race going. But most kids 12 and up could handle that part. Unfortunately our public library doesn't carry this book even though I told them about it. I do plan to buy a copy soon.
5,This is a GREAT book!,"This book is VERY detailed.The thought of nuclear war,being the last people on the planet(although the author never says anything about the rest of the world.)In my own opinion,it should be made into a movie.It has an eerie effect on the reader.I mean,how would you like it if you were the last person alive?I still think she shouldve found more survivors other than Mr.Loomis.Its just not right.But anybody should like this book.It will open peoples eyes on life and what it could be like after a holocaust.Id right more but Ive said my peace."
2,Two Stars,"I rated the book, ""Z for Zacharia"", Two stars because the whole story is about Ann saying how she was planning to do all these plans that she has and then she never would do anything. I just got so bored with Ann and Mr. Loomis having their little war and Ann just kept letting Mr. Loomis beat up on her. I wish Ann took charge and stuck up for herself instead of taking the abuse from Mr. Loomis. It was a real disappointment. It was way too slow and nothing really happened. There wasn't really even a climax.I mean I thought the author was creative, but I think he should have taken more time and added more details. Well, that is the book."
3,Disappointing.,"I was expecting more from this book. Apparently the best writing was on the back. Ann was a great character and I was very grateful to see a girl with such an independent nature. The plot was a good idea but it could have been carried out more fluently. At points it lagged. Also, The cliff-hanger was to much. You become attached to a character who got abused the whole story then was left once again on her own. This book would be perfect with a sequel, otherwise to short and no closure."
4,Powerful what-if,"I had to read this in 8th grade as part of a segment regarding nuclear weapons and someday I'd like to read it again. This book was amazing and has always made me appreciate the tenuousness of our civilization. I'm a bit surprised that it was required reading, though, since it's material that might give one nightmares and paranoia. I would want my kids to read it and think about it, but other adults might not feel the same way."
5,one of my fave books ever,"I loved this book. We had to read it in school and I actually enjoyed reading this one. It is just a really really good book! well written, interesting, scary and much more. I would highly recommend it."
3,survival of the fittest.,"16-year-old Ann Burden once lived happily on a family farm, in a valley on the outskirts of Ogdentown. A war has made the World radioactive. The valley is unaffected; Ann is the only one left alive and survives by farming. John Loomis, a scientist from Cornell discovers the valley by traveling in the only suit made to protect from radiation. Soon Mr. Loomis's tyrannical nature takes over and Ann finds herself fighting for her life. There is only one valley; Mr. Loomis hoards the safe suit, and no way for Ann to survive unless something is done."
1,pointless reading,This book is the boringest book in the world and should not be forst apon young adults by cruel teachers in high schools around australia. It is about a girl that knew she was the last woman in the world and the only chance of the suvival of the human race depends on her having children with a man old enough to be her father. I feel the book would have been better if she had blown her brains out with her .22 and made us all happy.
1,Unententertaining,For a reader who can finish complicated long books with ease. This book sure seems to drag on. Good theme but the story really doesn't develop at all. Main character not much feelings not enough vengeance. Waste of money.
3,"An okay read, but not much more","Ann Burden is living in her family's valley convince that she is the only person left in the world after a nuclear war. Then one day John Loomis, a scientist in an anti-radiation suit. At first Ann is happy to have someone with her. But soon Ann realize that there more to Loomis than meets the eye.I realize that Z for Zachariah is a teenage book, but the one thing that I notice was that the main characters seem to very little emotional base to them. Overall it an okay, but not much more."
1,Not too good,"Although several years have passed since I read this book, I remember laughing my head off at how lousy the setup for this book was. The author did not do any homework, or chose to ignore it. As for the insight provided into the psychology of people (mentioned in a previous review), there are MUCH better books available."
5,Excellent Book,"I read this book in the 9th grade, and my wife and I just read it again after finding it in a box in my parents attic (26 years laters). My main reason for writing this review is to first, highly recommend it to others. It's an easy read and can be completed in no time, for those who don't like a long novel.Secondly, I'd like to comment on the review by J. R. Fredsall from Sydney, Australia, listed below. This is not a scientific novel, or a classroom science book. It is a fictional novel like many, many others. If every novel were to be 100% factual, non-fiction would not exist, and the mind would have no way to escape the world we live in. Thank goodness authors don't take Fredsall's views for granted and write all their books based on scientific facts. There is a place for scientific facts to be presented, and fiction is not one of them.And as far as Fredsall's view on the book containing anti-male events; my statements above can answer that as well.Get the book and enjoy it!"
3,Z for Zachariah,"Z for Zachariah, written by Robert C. O'Brien, is a novel that is difficult to determine whether it is ""good"" or ""bad."" This book is about a 16 year-old girl named Ann, who fights to survive in an environment where a man puts her life in danger. What is interesting is how Robert C. O'Brien weaves in his own life experiences in his writing, including his love for nature, which is an element that Ann must rely on for her survival. Although this novel is somewhat slow-paced in the beginning, it picks up as you read along."
4,an old favorite,"I read this book when I was probably about 11 or 12 at first, and I remember enjoying it thoroughly. I re-read it very recently, and even though I'm 19 and this book is so-called ""young adult,"" I still enjoyed it as much as the first time. A great way to introduce the younger set to science fiction. O'Brien does a great job of writing from a young woman's point of view, and as the reader, you feel what it's like to be in her place. I'd suggest this to anyone, not just ""young adults."" :)"
4,Z For Zachariah-A Book of Triumph,"Z For Zachariah is an exciting book of triumph. It teaches the hardships of being alone, and just how well you can trust someone you just met. Ann Burden is a sixteen year-old girl, living in a small town in the suburbs of Ogdentown. Everything was the usual, until radioactive material is released and the radio's and television's shut down, one by one. Soon enough, Ann is left without her family and fighting to survive. Little did she know, the fighting was about to get a whole lot worse. When a strange man named Mr. Loomis shows up, he bathes in radioactive water and becomes very sick. She is stuck to nurse him and amazingly, he heals. However, Mr. Loomis is not the nice, noble man he had lead her to believe. They end up against eachother, and Ann is soon undergoing an adventure she had never thought would come."
3,not my type!,i read this book for my summer reading and knowing a little about the author and personally knowing the family tought that the book would be good.yeah it was ok but its a little frusturating because when the character makes the wrong decisions when its obvious what the character should have done different.the book was just weird. i loved mrs. frisby and the rats of nimh but this would not have been my first choice.i reccomend this book to people who enjoy reading suspense and the experience of ending a book that leaves it up to you to use your imagination. happy reading!
3,So-so Zachariah,"I didn't hate this book, but I didn't find it very interesting or uplifting. The book takes place following a nuclear war, where there are only two survivors, Mr. Loomis and Ann. The pace of the book is very slow. It got very tiring dwelling on Mr. Loomis' illness page after page. It was nerve-wracking wondering about his past and Edward's death. I liked Ann as a character, and I think she tried very hard to help him but he was abusive. I don't appreciate having a lead character who is a young girl being treated that way in a novel. It might be real but it's pretty insulting to a reader of the same age and sex. I didn't appreciate the way the story ended, again especially in the way Ann was treated."
2,Z for Zachariah was a ok book but it was confusing,I didn't really care for the book but I think it was fun to try and read it by the end of the summer. I think it was ok. I thought it was confusing because they skip the subject around alot
2,Don't even Bother...,"I rated Z for Zachariah 2 stars. The book takes place in the future after a nuclear war. ""Magically"", 16-year-old Ann Burden manages to stay alive, thinking she is the only person left in the world. She encounters another man and he becomes extremely protective as they interact in the valley. In my opinion, it was too slow-paced and focused on details that were irrelevant to the book. It was very unrealistic, especially how Ann was the only person in the valley that just happened to escape the effects of the nuclear war. The writing was monotonous and colorless. The climax was very weak, and I found it hard to relate to Ann at all. The voice from which it was told was dreadfully uninteresting. I'd possibly be interested in reading the book if it were told from Mr. Loomis's view or an omniscient view. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes repetitive, mind-numbing, and action-lacking books."
2,"Others may have liked it, but certainly not me.","I personally did not like the book at all. The characters were unrealistic, poorly developed, and not true to themselves throughout the entire book. The two later get caught up in a psychological game of cat and mouse. Ann, who is normally a sweet, kind, and caring girl becomes paranoid towards the end of the book, and killed her only friend, Faro (her dog), thinking that he'll lead Mr. Loomis to her.If I was the last woman on Earth and I found another person I would run up to him and jump for joy, not hide in the mountains and let him jump into a pool of radioactive water. And if I was horribly sick and then this kind, caring person took care of me, I wouldn't try to shoot her, rape her, and run her out of her home, I would say a simple thank you.This book had an interesting concept, but the characters were simply too unbelievable for me."
5,Great book!,Ordered the book for my son's class project. It would have taken a week to get it from the local bookstore since they did not carry it. He loves the book and I will read it as soon as he is done.
3,A Little Scary,I did not like this book bcause it was scary because being the last parsen on earth I would not like to be the last person alive. There would not be any one to talk to. But if you like stories like that this would be a good book for you.
2,Not as good as I expected,"We had to read this book for English and like most books for english it wasn't as good as it could've been, I was really disappointed with the ending, it was a big let down, the least she could have done was shot him...I really do not like Mr Loomis because he is manipulative. It was alright, although I really wouldn't recommend for people who don't enjoy reading it to read it as it will just put you off reading more...if you want a good book try reading Wilbur Smith or Sidney Sheldon, and if you're a younger teen then go for Sweet Valley High! :)"
5,WOW,"Ok i thought this story was really stupid but it pulls u into its pages and makes u want to read more. i had to read this for a school project and i love reading but these kind of stories dont interest me,but once i got into it i loved it and now i want to read it again. i so wish there was a sequel. im going to purchase this book so i can read it over and over."
3,Don't know,Bayer Microlet Lancents. They are silicon coated microlet lancets. Now you know as much as I do about them. They do not list the gauge and do not tell you that they are a name brand universal lancet. I have not used them yet. I am about ready to start though.
4,Interior Design Draft Kit,"I bought this for my father for Christmas and he absolutely flipped. He had wanted a drafting table because this used to be his major and his goal in life, but things had fallen by the wayside, as things are wont to do... Seeing as drafting tables are hundreds of dollars, I found this - and he loved it. This is the perfect way to give a drafting table to someone if you can't afford it otherwise, and it will definitely please drafters out there that are looking to get started again!"
3,Not as entertaining as the first.,"If you like the genre of 80's martial arts films like I do, this one isn't too bad."
3,cute video for the kids,"This one has the same normal kid as in the first one but now with a supernatural twist about two magic rings that each give the wearer special fighting powers. When our hero gets the first ring baddies came after him from everywhere. There are some corny lines like when at the end he is fighting the god like man with both rings and show how he can shoot bolts of lightning that make cars explode and his freinds tell everyone around them not to use their guns because the powerless little boy needs the pride of killing a deity all by himself, there by putting hostages at risk. Leave it to the power ranger fans unless you're desperate for fight scenes"
4,A fair value,"Excellent daytrading reference, where many succesful traders are talking about the way they succeeded and why."
1,Author's looking to cash in on a sequel by repeating book,This is just a greedy attempt to milk the public. The first book is the same.
3,Trading Psychology,Not a bad collection of interviews. Contains more than I expected about trading psychology for which I recommend Schwager's Market Wizards and Patel's The Mind of a Trader.
3,Beware,"First let me say I really enjoyed this book, but what really bothered me was the way money was tossed around. I think the risk of daytrading for most of the people reading this book is to high. The people interviewed to me were highly skilled and extremely knowledgeable of all the markets. Thats just my opinon. I tryed commidities once. I read a few books took a few lessons and really thought I new what I was doing and really got burned along with a whole lot of people. This book motives people into thinking that if they can do it so can I. Good reading but a lot of hype."
1,JUNK BOOK,"These guys know how to make money. all they did was interview people to write them down, print them and sell them. they asked trades short questions, and traders give them really short answers. EVERY traders say they lost lots of money at the beginning and now they are making a lot of it. ""YOU LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERENCE"" they said. if it's so why the hell do I need to read the damn book?"
5,"Real Life, Live Examples!","A very well book. It gathers and puts together the thoughts of many of the greatest Day Traders in the US. This is a real example of how to learn from the best. If one listens to what they are saying, success will follow. One can learn from the best of the best's mistakes and use their starategies and techniques affectively.I found this book very useful.Thank You, Steve."
2,Not much in here....,"I looked forward to reading this book after having read the authors first book. Unfortunately I was greatly dissapointed. No great ""secrets"" are revealed unless you find items like ""make sure to use a stop loss"" and be ""mentally prepared"" an eye opener."
1,Disappointing - no real secrets here,"The title is misleading. The techniques and emotional ""tips"" are old news. I expected some fresh, new strategies rather than a rehash of the known."
4,Good Reinforcement.....,"I read this book on the way back from the Money Show in Las Vegas, Although I already knew many of the topics discussed in the book, it reinforced many important disciplines that many of us forget, or take for granted. After Meeting Mr. Friedfertig at the Show (as well as Mr. Nassar) I must say that both of these gentleman know what it takes to produces winning trader's. The best part of this book is that I have learned that many of these Million Dollar Traders had the same trials and tribulations that I did at the early part of their careers,now I know more about how they turned it all around to become very successful! If I got nothing more than that out of this book it was worth thousands to my bottom line.."
4,Tremendous and invaluable help in day trading.,This book is tremendous and is an invaluable tool in online trading. This book will become the next Reminences of a Stock Operator and should be used as a reference book in every daytraders library. Should be read and re-read.
1,What Junk!,Much better books out there like Strategies for the Online Day Trader (Gonzalez and Rhee) which will really make you make a killing in the market. Why read bad work that doesn't work?
3,prefer the original version,"I have an album by David Dee from the mid eighties called Sheer Pleasure.It is one of my favorite blues albums of all time. I hope this ""comment"" isnot inappropriate, as there is no disrespect intended. I have only heardthe samples from this 1991 album, here on amazon. Goin Fishin seems to be aremake of the original "" on my way fishin"". The songs on this album are okbut the songs on ""Sheer Pleasure"" (1986) are amazing!!!! The reason I'm herelooking around in the first place, looking for more of those old songs.All in all David Dee gets a THUMBS UP!ThanksSteve"
1,I Weep For My Country,"This book from Free Enterprise, gee I wonder what their agenda is? use's the same language that the violent hate group The Sahara Club use's, and who the FBI quotes in their press releases, to justify the terrorization & chemical torture of young activists. Amazon a company based in Seattle which has it's own experience with pepper spray sadists would link this filth with a noble title like Ecodefense. The efforts to reduce the virginal beauty of the last wild forests to sand dunes, sani-cans, and motorcycle trails is proceeding, the good guys are losing..."
1,A horrible piece of right wing tripe.,"This is a mash-up of right-wing, anti-environmental propaganda and quotes and research taken way out of context. How do I know? My own work was used inappropriately in this book. Save your money."
1,Pitiful,The book is a litany of jaded corporate arguments for the continued destruction of nature so that a few people can get richer. To be read only in the same way you watch a bad B-movie -- for the unintentional laughs. The book's inability to understand social activism (not to mention concepts like justice) would have made it a best-seller in Czarist Russia.
5,Great Book!,This book is a great exposition on violence perpetrated in the name of the environment. It exposes Ted Kaczynski's connections to the environmental movement and goes in-depth into the detrimental effect his acts have had upon innocent individuals targeted simply to further a pseudo-intellectual agenda.
1,One star only because you don't offer zero as an option,"I was interested in hearing the anti-environment view to challenge my own beliefs. Unfortunately Arnold is so obviously deceptive, that I could not take seriously his critiques. Don't waste your time or money on this dud."
1,Transparent propoganda.,"Ron Arnold's premise here, it seems, is that the Unabomber is or was linked to the environmental movement. This book is less about the Unabomber than an attempt to demonize environmentalists. Tries to make connection after connection that simply does not exist."
5,The best in the Screwballs class!,"This is one of the wackiest comedies ever made. A non-stop, star-studded orgy of inspired lunacy that was the hallmark of the greatest comedies of the 1930's/early 40's (and a thoroughly extinct species in the 1990's). Every Hollywood funny man and funny woman of the day seems to have wormed their way into this one. An absolute gem. Total, cathartic laugh therapy."
3,a minor fields classic,"fields was perhaps one of the first comics to prove you don't have to be a sympathetic character to be funny. here he's the curmudgeonly president of a tiny country that is on the verge of bankruptcy, constantly on his guard against revolutionary schemes and assassination attempts. all the standard fields stuff is here, of course, since fields is always fields: the hat placed on the cane instead of the head, the wisecracks, the innuendos, the sight gags; everything except the drinking, which came later. that fields is as cold and brassy as he was in ""the dentist"" and ""you can't cheat an honest man"" takes nothing from the laughs. as is too often the case with fields films, though, you wish there were more of him and less of just about everyone else."
5,Is it too late?,"I very highly recommend this film for anyone that wants to understand whats going on in America and where we are heading. If you want a taste you can find portions of it on U-tube, etc. The facts presented are easily verifiable and jive with what I have witnessed while working for the government for 20 years. A companion film I recommend is ""Why we Fight"", released in about 2003. I guarantee it will change your perception of our country and leave you in thought.Most people however, do not want to understand whats going on and prefer to do the old ostrich head in the sand thing, and to then act surprised later. If this is you, stay away, you'll have nightmares later."
4,Jamal (formerly of Illegal) makes solo debut,"Jamal and Malik formed the kids group Illegal that arrived on the scene as the antithisis to Kris Kross and Another Bad Creation. Jamal has now linked up with Redman, Erick Sermon, and Keith Murray to help form the Def Squad. While Jamal definatly has alot of talent, to much of this album sounds the same. As you listen to each song you get the feeling your listening to a remix of the one you heard before it. Jamal's Def Squad counterparts put in some decent cameo's. Redman, as usual, steals the show. Listening to this disc you get the idea that their could be a really good Jamal cd somewhere down the road, but this isn't it. For now you're best off sticking to his more polished friends."

1,Is there such a thing as case reasearch?,"As one of the many forensic investigators involved in the crime scenes and apprehension of Resendiz-Ramirez I find this book is just a rehash of news articles and watered-down at that. Apparently, little or no research went into this book nor does it appear that authorities that were involved in the case(s) attributed to Angel were even considered."
1,Full of Lies,This book is inaccurate and not worth the paper it's printed on. The author was just trying to make a quick buck and didn't bother finding a lot of facts in the process.
1,Product was not as shown in the picture.,"Product was not as shown in the picture. I contacted the merchant through Amazon several times to return the item, but no response so far."
5,A Good Overview of the Early PSB,"The ""Discography"" was my first-ever consciously-liked record. At 11 years of age, when I first heard it, I didn't have a clue what was going on in those songs, but I know I liked it.I'm not the most knowledgeable person in music, yet I can tell what I like. The PSB of this particular compilation represent the 1980s, but their sound is original enough to span decades. This is to say that they sound nothing like your typical Eighties band.The songs on this disc are good, probably the best-known work by the PSB, but one should also consider their ensuing work -- they haven't stopped producing to this day!""West End Girls"" is on ""Discography"", but my favourites were ""Jealousy"" and their cover of U2's ""Where The Streets Have No Name"".If you're a club music fan or have penchant for any sort of electronica, it's a must-have."
5,What have I done to deserve this?,"Good question! But PSB's have delivered, reguardless. Being a product of the 80's, I sometimes miss that era. When I do, I reach for Discography first every time."
5,A classic classic,"It is totally rare to find an album with 18 cuts and that I truly say ""there isn't one I don't like.""This is the second copy I've purchased (I feel I need a back-up just in case!!) I purchased the first copy in Scotland in 2009 and it cost me 15pounds!! Totally smashing!!"
5,areck,"The CD ""Discography"" by the Pet Shop Boys is a great compilation of some of their greatest hits."
4,"""It's A Sin"" not to have this collection.","I've enjoyed the ""Pet Shop Boys"" ever since I got my copy of ""Please"" on vinyl, and once this cd was released, I picked it up right away. Fanatics may miss tracks, but for the casual fan, this has everything and more. It includes the bigger hits ""West End Girls"", ""Opportunities (lets make lots of money)"", ""It's A Sin"", and ""Domino Dancing"". Plus the covers of ""Always On My Mind"" and ""Where The Streets Have No Name (I cant take my eyes off of you)"". Also, the songs I didn't know here are as good as the others. I like these guys because they give a warm and emotion, to a kind of music that is usually lacking it, ""Suburbia"" being a prime example. Overall it's an excellent collection, and will go great with your ""New Order"" and ""Moby"" cd's."
5,Required listening.,"Over the last 10 years, the Pet Shop Boys' American audience seems to have dwindled to a cult gay following. That's too bad, because, as Discography shows, Pet Shop Boys are one of the finest pop groups around and deserve far more success in the USA. Discography is a near-flawless retrospective covering their hits from 1985-1991. And the liner notes include the release date, UK chart position, and comments for each single. Listening to this disc was a trip through memory lane, from my days in high school right through my college years. I have always been a fan of PSB since day one and own almost their entire catalogue. If you're looking to build a collection of great pop music CDs, Discography should be one of your first purchases. It's highly recommended, and it's required listening."
5,PSB at Their Best,"I once read in a magazine one of those articles interviewing people about if they were to be stranded on a desert island and were able to have 20 albums with them, which ones would they choose? Well, you guessed it. Many of those people chose Discography. And so would I! It is simply and beautifully a perfect set of PSB gems from the 80's up until '91. Not one bad song in the lot. Looking forward to Discography 2!"
5,Great!,"I never really realized how many songs of the Pet Shop Boys I love. Until I found this album, it's amazing. Every single song is a masterpiece and satisfies my taste in music. Something that is actually pretty hard to do. All the songs have such an infectuous vibe, it's just phenomenal. My faves are (I still can't believe that I gotta say so much here): Suburbia, West End Girls, Always on my mind, So hard, Domino Dancing,Being Boring, What have I done to deserve this, Opportunities, Where the streest have no name and It's a sin. The voice of the lead singer is just phenomenal and so soft, great. Not that I am generally an ""always"" soft guy (I don't care if someone else is, though). But still it really satisfies my softer side. The lyrics of the songs here are also very intelligent and they really fit even if it's mainly dance music. Bravo!"
4,Recommended Collection Of Great Dance Pop,"This is an excellent greatest hits package. The Pet Shop Boys always did something different than the rest of the music scene. ""West End Girls"" is a classic song that I remember being played all over the radio around late '85 when I was a teenager. There are some great songs on here, and this is a great starter album for anybody looking for a great introduction. Recommended."
5,This event was my pearl Harbor,I saw this program on TV and liked the way and amount of material that they covered;they had things in this program that I had not seen before and I have watched alot of JFK material so was happy to see it out on DVD; so that I could add it to my collection of history.
4,More questions about LBJ when he assumed the presidency,"This is a documentary about the hours after JFK was shot and the actions LBJ took to assume the presidency. No matter what he did, he would have been critized by someone. In the end he probably did the right thing given the tumultuous times. No one was sure whether the Soviets were behind the assassination and if this was the beginning of WWIII. The US needed a strong man to take control and let the world know we would not sink to the level of a despotic nation whose government couldn't survive such a catastrophe. Jackie was criticized later in life for marrying a foreigner, but her demeanor during this time was amazing. Poor Ladybird was caught in the middle-wanting to comfort the widow but needing to stand by her husband as he assumed his new position. Conspiracy theorists may not enjoy this so much but it does capture the bitterness of RFJ and the JFK camp."
1,The switch caskets,"I just watched The Kennedy Assassination 24 hours after TV - I lost all confidence in your story when I saw that the casket that JFK's body was loaded into Air Force One in Dallas and then unloaded in DC was not the same casket you repeatably shows as on the plane during the trip back to DC - The casket you showed being loaded about half way through show and then unload was a medal round end casket, probably a 48 once solid bronze sealer casket - the one you repeatably showed on the plane, even a close up on it with a broken end handle was a square end wood casket - on funeral day JFK was back in a round end casket, you could see it under the flag - next time spend a little money on a technical adviser and maybe your store will be more believable - anybody that switch caskets would also make up things just to make the store sound good"
2,Not so useful.,I didn't find these series of books very useful. I felt like these series of books were more of a manual than an informative text book. The book did have a lot of accurate information but it did not help with service or troubleshooting issues as much as I'd like. Thanks!!!
2,Southern Rock Classics,Either I didn't read the entire product detail or something was omitted. Most of the songs on here are live versions and I'm not a fan of live songs. I like cranking up the studio versions. The song selection was what drew me to by it but I was really disappointed that it was a live album.
3,Oh Those Holograms,"The Good Things:-It was only five bucks!-Special effects are a little antequated, but still passable.-There's plenty of action throughout.-The guns that shoot explosive rounds are cool!-The bad guy was great.-Some interesting ideas; LA in a biodome, a corporation running the city, prisoners stuck in holographic stasis...The Bad Things:-Some lines contradict the action. Some of it was downright cheesy.-Characters are typical, almost like stock characters.-There are a few boring bits.It's a B-rated movie that's not as bad as it could have been. The characters and plot are a little bland, but it is pretty exciting and has some interesting ideas and scenes. It's not as great as ""RoboCop"" or the ""Matrix,"" but would be a good compliment to something like ""The Lawnmower Man"" or ""Virtuosity.""The disc is only in fullscreen and has no special features. The picture and sound quality is not bad, but not great either."
2,HOLLOW INDEED,"HOLOGRAM MAN is a film from the early nineties that tried to envision a ""Big Brother"" kind of world, with funky looking cars, a biodome over Los Angeles and a nasty corporation running the government. It's full of hectic shootouts and explosions but doesn't have much of cast or any kind of cohesive plotting. Joe Lara sleepwalks through his role as Decoda, the cop on a mission, and co-writer/producer/co-star Evan Lurie, muscles ablazing, tries to be a Sylvester Stallone clone, with about as much acting ability. The effects are cheesy and there's no real logic behind the whole process of holographing these criminals. And the movie has the most incompetent police force on screen. If you like lots of firepower and pyrotechnics, then you might find something to like in this subpar feature."
1,Pure Rocky Road Trash! It doesn't deserve a star!,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing! This is a HUGE load of pants! It's so bad it's on my top ten list of worst movies of all time.Joe Lara is a great actor but he was COMPLETELY wasted! Every other actor was just plain awful.They were reduced to such garbage.The script and storyline are seriously PADDED! And Joe looked like a major fag in that white leotard.I must admit that the FX were decent,but the film is sooooooooooo terrible. It's as boring as hell and is so heinous that it's laughable.The makers of this movie should go to a maximum security facility and a million dollar fine! The film is far too gory and the body count is WAY too high.What a pathetic waste! Rated R-contains gruesome,gory violence,strong profanity and a scene of strong sexuality."
4,Hologram Man,"The first time i watched this movie i loved it and the fact it kept me interested was what i love most in movies.And when i was able to buy it on DVD what a blast for me as it is one movie ive watched twice in the past 3 weeks,with my son visiting and sitting with me enjoying a movie he had not seen before.If you like action it has it, if you like hot guys it has them,so dont wait it is a movie thats not big technology but very very good to enjoy over and over as years go by."
2,Household of Saints,What a disappointment! I purchased it based on reviews from a film critic who obviously doesen't present a summary that reflects what's in store for the reader. It is not filled with the charm--nor does it really reflect a real Italian family in New York. Pass it up.
3,Not so hot,"I recently saw Stanley Jordan perform in person. Some of the songs he performed were the same as on this album. However, in person they were much better. There is too much departing from the melody on the songs on this album, so they often wind up being more about Stanley's virtuosity with his guitar than about capturing the song."
5,I thought it was so cool!,I thought the book was so cool. How an eglish girl was there for Mollys birthday.I wish they could come out of more books with Emily in them.And I'm happy that they got there dogs that they wished for.
5,Only book that helped me in coping with the loss of my son,"I lost my 26 year old son in April of 1999. I have read many grief books, but this one struck home in the author's poignantly honest expression of his grief and confusion. He holds out hope but gives full recognition to the pain, the regret, the deep agony that shakes our very souls when we experience this most terrible of losses. I keep my copy on my bedside table and return to it over and over, especially certain pages which I have marked as particularly meaningful to me."
5,God's Grace,"This was the single most important book I read after my son was killed in an accident with me.Mr. Wolterstorff, in all of his suffering and doubt, allowed God's Grace to work with in his words.In the five years since Michael died, we have purchased over 25 copies and given them to people who have suffered losses. His essays have been a source of inspiration in our Christmas Newletters and Homilys by Pastors.The book that shows you the Grace in Suffering."
4,Wolterstorff's Journey,"Lament for a Son is Nicholas Wolterstorff's personal struggle with the death of his twenty-five year old son. Wolterstorff's heart is laid bare to the reader in a most intimate manner. The reader is able to accompany Wolterstorff through his journey of grief, pain, mourning, questioning, and hope. It is rare that one is able to gain insight of this sort into a grieving person's struggle. As Wolterstorff's articulates, we all grieve uniquely; and to witness one man's personal journey through the healing process is illuminating.I read this book a couple of weeks after my father passed. It was comforting to read the thoughts of a fellow believer going through the same healing process. I recommend this book to anyone struggling with the pain that accompanies death. One will no doubt find it comforting to sit next to Wolterstorff ""on the mourning bench""."
4,I wish I had this book when I was a young corporate rat.,"I bought this book actually out of curiosity. It was pocket-size, and also visually very appealing. After perusing it, I have this feeling that this book is more intended for very young executives and/or new supervisors.In terms of basic steps, the book is just fine. In a nutshell, there are some two dozen of ""strategic thinking"" topics, which have been artfully rolled into the 72 brightly designed and easy-to-read pages, studded along the way with colurful boxed tips, 101 of them to be exact. It is designed for easy reading. There is even a simple but fun test at the end pages.Highly recommended for all beginners into the management field, as well as for older kids, who wants to learn how to think strategically. I wish I had this book when I was a young corporate rat.For a deeper treatment on the subject, I would suggest a quick browse of books in my Strategic Thinking Bookshelf (listmania)."
3,Short Concise Overview,"This book provides a good overview but little that can be applied on a practical basis to help you do strategic planning. The main strengths of this book are:* fast and easy to read* many useful tips* questions to ask yourself are frequently very usefulIf you are looking for a concise overview of the strategic planning process, read this book. But if you are looking for information to guide you step-by-step through the strategic planning process, I recommend you keep looking.Karen L. Jett, CMA, Author Grow Your People, Grow Your Business"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"While I strongly recommend MacDonald's books, When Life is a Struggle and Always True, I was disappointed in the contents of this book. I found it to be simplistic and overly ""works/righteousness' oriented rather than grace driven."
2,Not in good condition,"I was disappointed when I received the book as it was written in red ink throughout, underlined and very used. I felt like the seller misrepresented the condition although there may not have been any details, it just said ""good"" condition and this was not the case."
4,Attitude adjustments for those weary of wilderness living.,"A 2007 summer reading list mini review.James MacDonald has written a relevant book about approaching life with the proper attitudes. The steps are clear as they are obtainable. It is written with a pastor's heart but also from the perspective of just an ordinary believer trying to follow God wholeheartedly no matter what.Macdonald's candor about his own struggles helps the reader to deal honestly with their own. This is an excellent first book for those not famliliar with the concepts of ""taking off and putting on."" The book examines individual unbiblical attitudes such as complaining and rebellion and shows how to replace those with biblical attitudes."
5,"Not a naturalist, but an excellent writer","I had expected to find the recollections of a naturalist; instead I found an engaging tour of one man's attempt to overcome his phobia of snakes. It was not really about his fear, though, rather, it was mankind's fear he was challenging. His attitude to down-home rattlesnake roundups put me off, the least he could have done would have been to criticize their brutality. Otherwise, a fantastic book. P.S. if you are looking for a naturalist book, read Erik Pianki's The Lizard Man Speaks."
2,Too many distractions,"I enjoy thoughtful rambles as much as the next person, but Snakebite Survivors has too little burger, and way too much bun. Furthermore, Seal divides each story into four or five sections and then sprinkles them around the book. So to actually follow one of his narratives, the reader must wade through not only his constant musings about his cabbie's driving style, what Australia looks like from the air, and just about everything else --not only that -- but also the bits and pieces of all the other narratives that he mixes in. On the other hand, the basic stories and information are interesting and enjoyable reading. If they weren't so jumbled up and mixed with irrelevancies, I would have really enjoyed the book."
2,rambling....,"This book could have probably been half as long as it is if he'd stick to snakes and things pertaining to them. There was much ""historical"" information setting up a chapter that just went on and on for pages with little-if any-mention of snakes. The stories that actually DID involve serpents were usually quite interesting, but the format mentioned in other reviews about each story being broken up and scattered around the book was really annoying. This one took me a longer time to finish than I wanted. I hoped for venomous snakes, but it fell far short of my expectaion. See if a library has it before spending money on it."
1,Even paranoid delusionals can find a publisher these days,"The only thing interesting about this bizarre excursion into inaccuracy and paranoia is that this book is on the Amazon ""Wish List"" of Patrick Bedell, the individual who, it is ""alleged"",attempted to storm the Pentagon the other day.That's right, Patrick, armed to the teeth, was downed in a hail of bullets when, heavily armed, he opened fire on some Pentagon guards.Bedell is an early nominee for the Darwin awards.He thought this is a great book.'nuff said.But, as one reviewer reminded the paranoid fools among us who might swallow this drivel: if a SHRED of any of it had even the slightest grain of truth, the totally biased left-wing lamestream media would be running like Olympic sprinters with the story! Good grief, even after the NY Times found that Bush won in Florida, we STILL have Keith Olbermann claiming Bush stole the election.If anything in this book was true, MSNBC would be running it nightly."
1,But Where's The Aliens?,"A hilarious read that stretches truth and plausibility to the limits. Has Mafia, CIA, assassination attempts, secret Arab deals, drug dealing, etc. But where's the aliens? And everybody knows George Bush was the second gunman on the grassy knoll! If you're a fan of Oliver Stone acid trips then this crazy book is great for you!"
1,One star too many- WHAT A JOKE,"This book is RIDICULOUS. I can't believe there are people who actually believe this nonsense- obviously the uneducated people the left wing have failed to educate (for obvious tactical reasons)are the only ones who will take this drivel as fact. I am disturbed at the other reviews here- someone questioned why the media doesn't run with this information?? Are you kidding?? The mainstream media is sooooooo liberal and so favorable to Democrats that if this book had ANY SHRED OF TRUTH OR PROOF TO IT- you bet your life on it that they would report it! Over and over, I might add. The tactics of the left wing know no limits. This book is for the gullible and the people who love fantasy stories. UNBELIEVABLE - the author should thank his lucky stars that he isn't being sued for slander!"
2,"Hard to read for an ""ordinary"" person","I found the book hard to read. I am not a theologian, but have had a fair amount of biblical training and education overall during my life. The author uses a lot of parenthetical writing, which breaks up the sentences and paragraphs. Overall it was very hard to follow. I thought that the subject matter was good however."
4,"The Wisdom of Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes: An Introduction to Wisdom Literature","Very balanced and even-handed introduction to this interesting subject. There is great respect for the scriptures here and a desire to understand it, without bringing in meaning that was not intended."
5,Wella works!,"Unfortunately, the Wella spray gel that I purchased is now discontinued. It's a great product & I can't believe that Wella has stopped selling it. BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Glad I got what I got!!"
4,Just what I was looking for,"Table and bar stools are high quality. They have a nice finish, and were not difficult to assemble. They are pretty well-built, also."
3,"Nice price, looks good BUT stools not comfortable","I'm happy with my purchase since we rarely sit at the kitchen table to eat. However, when we do it's not for long. The stool seats are not deep enough and it feels like your falling off with not enough room to sit back on stool. Looks great and wearing well after several months. My table does have one leg that is uneven so we had to place filler underneath to steady table. Table and stools very high...AS NOTED in description. Older individuals and children have problems with height of stools."
4,poetry indeed,"This is Tommy Flanagan at his best. I have a japanese edition, as unfortunately it seems it not being sold in the US anymore. Tommy plays with George (Jiri) Mraz, the solid czech bass, and Kenny Washington on drums.It is a selection of standards that you've heard million times, but Flanagan makes them sound fresh. He does it in an understated manner: no flamboyant displays, no funky re-harmonizing, just very melodic solo-ing. His solo lines are so melodic they sound effortless. It is as if he is playing another melody on the chords, as they are constructed on the whole chart, not just a few bars.I particularly enjoyed Willow Weep for Me, or St Louis Blues. The only reason I gave the cd only 4 stars is because I am a little bothered by the last song. If the first 9 are jazz poetry, the last one veers into sappy romance, and sounds like easy listening stuff. Once it gets into the solo, it gets into a groove, but I don't enjoy the head."
1,DianaKrall-3 christmas songs only,I was diasppointed with my order. I read the other reviews and thought that my CD would have 6 songs - 3 for christmas and 3 from Japan that were not released in the US. Instead I got an older 1999 calendar with my CD of 3 songs. Be careful and ask questions before ordering. The christmas songs were great however!
5,Worth every penny,"For those of you who can actually enjoy and appreciate Ms. Krall's voice and work, this is a treasure. The calendar is a bonus and a pleasure--not the least bit overdone. I've lent it to dozens of folks-jazz fans and not-and they love it. What a find!"
3,Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas,This 6 song CD is not worth the money. Come on $... for 6 songs!She is good but if I could return it and get my money back I would.
4,Silky Seasonal Jazz,"It may be cliche to say, but Krall's Christmas contribution is classic silky jazz, right for the season. The three songs are a fine mix of slow and more upbeat tunes, and while brief - 3 tunes, as I said - it's a great addition to Krall's growing repetoire, from one of the industry's greatest new voices. While pricey at $28USD, it can be had in Canada for much, much less."
2,Not what you think,I bought this cd thinking it was Diana Krall's Christmas cd. It contains three Christmas songs and three other songs. Not alot for ($) The music is great but I waited a long time to get this cd and I am very disappointed with it.
4,Great But Wished For More,Love Diana Krall's Interpretation of a Couple of Christmas Classic. Just wished there were more tunes on the CD.
3,Wonderful album but too short,"A couple of the old standards are here and the departure from the typical holiday fair is welcome. Though certainly a must for diehard Diana Krall fans like myself, I find myself wanting more from this all too short play list, even if it is just an imported promo."
3,"Some great holiday music, but don't stop now.","I was fortunate enough to be able to listen to a friend's copy of this CD. More great music from Diana Krall, but for the price, this Compact Disc is very compact as in ""not enough music"". This CD is a ""Christmas Teaser"" that makes you wish for more and wonder why she didn't follow through with a more complete Holiday offering (at a real-world price). Maybe next year?"
5,"I Don't Know Why, I Just Do","The further adventures of LA's most neurotic 12/13 year-old continue in KRITZERLAND. We were first introduced to him and his family from Mars in author Bruce Kimmel's novel BENJAMIN KRITZER.Kimmel (FIRST NUDIE MUSICAL & many CD's) writes about the 50's and 60's in a way that invokes not only nostalgia, but a longing to be there. And if you were there, dear reader, you will find yourself laughing and then stopping short with recognition.The Columbia Record Club, ""Ben-Hur"" at reserved seat prices, and when Friday night meant 'The Twilight Zone' - are all factors in Benjamin's life. His actions and reactions as he enters Junior High, makes new friends, and deals with loss are written about with care.Don't miss the tour of KRITZERLAND - as the 1950's give 'way to the 1960's, and Benjamin is bar mitzvahed - a telephone call will change his life. And it leads us neatly into what will be the third and final book in this Boomer Trilogy. Bravo, Kimmel!"
5,These are awesome!!!,"A friend of mine from Germany would send these to me every year. I was surprised that these aren't readily available in the U.S. I ordered these from here and they are just as good as I remember. Quick shipping, too."
1,Once Again,Another evangelical trying to make a dime on the idea of God. These guys are the ones who should be listed on a website!
4,More of a murder mystery this time.,"I like P.C. Doherty's Hugh Corbett series. In these books he deals with actual historical happenings, and Hugh Corbett, acting as the King's master spy is always sent to deal with hot ""political potatoes"". In this book he is again sent to try to get to the bottom of the murder of his son's former mistress, but when Hugh and Ranulf arrive they find a hotbed of rumour and speculation in a nunnery. Hugh walks the tightrope between satisfying his king and his eternal quest for the truth. This is an excellent medieval series based on true historical occurences."
4,First Time Read of Doherty,"This is the first Doherty mystery I have read, and I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characterization. Doherty draws his characters well, and fleshes out even the minor characters, and has a deft way of putting the characters together in ensemble. The story was well plotted. Not quite as much historical detail as some others, but a very satisfying read."
1,terrible disappointment,"We bought several different sets for our son for Christmas and found that all of them broke while we tried to assemble, except for one of the dinaosaurs. Poorly made and a total waste of money. I should have stuck with those silly Bionicles."
2,Important consideration here,"I installed this as part of the alarm system and this WILL NOT ALARM - UNLESS - you have the system armed (doors at a minimum in home mode).If you are at home, have the system off, and get a flood, you will not be notified. You can not only arm the flood sensor.I called Skylink just to confirm this.I am exchanging it for something that alarms 24/7.I like the rest of the system though."
5,kick ass remix,"I have an original printing of this song on 12"" vinyl. It was huge in the dance clubs back in the day.I copied it onto cd to preserve the vinyl.Great song.Amazing piano. Have always loved Lene Lovich andNew Toy is my favorite dance song from her."
4,helps me test,I have another but having a 2nd allows me to test at work-this item is very easy to use.
1,Beware of this Vendor,"Item was used and bloody, broken and disgusting~!!!Probably a health code violation in any state~!! Very dangerous also.Expired items inside, as well as prescription for someon else~! Ugh~!!"
5,Accu check soft clix lancet device,I love this product. It is so easy to place a lancet in this pen. There is not much pain or discomfort using this device.
2,Stay Away,"It was a big hit when released during 1995 but this 5-track, mini EP now is lame. The remixes are tired cliches and the production work is pedestrian by contempoarary standards. The fact that used CDs sell for less than a dollar clearly indicates what the general public thinks about this old release.If you are a Janet fan and don't own this, perhaps it is worth seventy-five cents. But, I seriously doubt that you will play this more than twice. Yeah, I know, it's Janet Jackson with tracks produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with additional remixing by David Morales. But, I still am not impressed and remain unenthusiastic."
4,Rare hip-hop remixes of Janet's soulful single,Runaway was recorded solely for her Design of a Decade album. The CD single and cassette maxi single featured different remixes. Here's the track listing: 1 G.man's Hip Hop Mix featuring Coolio 2 Silk's Old Skool Radio Mix 3 Jam & Lewis Street Mix Edit 4 G.man's Hip Hop Extended 5 LP VersionThis was released in 1995. Contains awesome picture of Janet and her beautiful abs with purple heart and lettering.The LP version is a smooth beautiful pop song. The remixes on this cassette bring a street/hip hop vibe to the song.
3,More likely a handbook,"The author put a lot of ""facts"" in this book. However, there are few explanation and no references. He describes many detail specifications that makes this book read as more likely a handbook. It's so easy to find out the differeces if we compare it with Tananbaum's or Stallings' computer network books, the laters are written in a teaching oriented form that readers are guided to understand basic theory and architecture. And of course, there are numerous references for both students and instructors to find out where those contents are originally from, or what to read for further studies. The lack of refernce is a big drawback for Carne's book. It's really abnormal. No matter if I were the instructor or the student I won't pick this book for textbook or self-learning. Even if I need handbook for reference, I'll choose either Freeman's books or just get a Newton's Telecom Dictionary for fast check. By the way, the graphs in the book are really rought and ugly."
1,THIS IS THE MOST BAD HORROR FILM OF JAPAN I EVER SEEN,ITS MADE BUY SOME KIDS AND A CAMERA BORING IT MADE ME FALL ASLEEP ME AND MY BROTHERS IN LAW I JUST SPENT $16.95 FOR NOTHING.
3,Requires some perserverance to finish the book.,"Being a fan of Corvettes for years, I wanted an ""insider's"" view of what goes on behind the scenes at a division of the largest automotive manufacturer in the world. It was much as expected. Having visited and done work at several GM plants and facilities, I am reminded of the inflated ""baggage"" that is so prevalent in large corporations. It was however, very interesting to read of the successes and triumphs within the division, be they few and far between, are truly successes. I liked the book because I am interested in the creative processes involved in new ""things"". Especially automotive related ""things"". It is a definite ""must-read"" for business majors preparing for a career at a large corporation. There's nothing like 'em. I especially appreciated the detail that went into all the various systems and functional testing of features in the car. If GM spent that much time on every ""new"" vehicle, the buying public would be very satisfied."
4,Definative review of how the new Corvette was designed,An absolute must read book for any old or new Corvette fan.This book provides a first hand look at the torturous 8 yearpath the new 5th generation Corvette took from design toproduction. The book is clearly written providingentertainment for both the technical and non-technicalreader.In my opinion this book is required reading for any currentCorvette owner.
2,PZeditor replies:,"I certainly don't want to start slinging mud with Jim, however I have to dispute his continued insistance that Dave McLellan did not complete the C5 chassis before he left GM. Dave has told me on several occasions that the C5 chassis was done when he left in 1992. Jim insists on painting Dave as the villian in All Corvettes Are Red, and that's a shame. McLellan was tough to work for but no one can question his vision or his genious. I still contend he is not portrayed fairly.As far as the other points that I took Schefter to task on, I stand by my sources and the first hand information they gave me."
2,all corvettes are red,"the book was in fair shape but not excellent. for $58 i did not expect to see a dark brown spot on the edge of about 40 pages. every time you pick the book up to open it the spot is clearly visible. i also discovered that four pages of pictures were cut out of the book. this is completely unacceptable for a book rated ""like new"". i expected ""like new"" just as it was advertised. it should have said ""fair"" with some damaged pages and some pages missing. the cost should have been maybe $10.00 like some of the others. (the original cost of the book was $29). i choose the more expensive one because i wanted a ""like new"" book. the book i received certainly was not ""like new""."
4,All Corvettes are Red,This is a great story about the Struggle to keep America's number one sports car from being made extinct. The writer is given a full access pass and writes a passionate insightful story.
3,"Eh, could be better.","It is a good guide. It could be better. The four regions of the city they focus on are far too restictive. They could spend more time in the North Side. Alot of the tourist-friendly sights of Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field, or Belmont and Clark arent even in the detailed parts in the book. The South Side has lots of space, which is good. Yet the City goes farther north, and alot of those areas are the places tourists love. Some of the maps of greater Chicago arent overly to scale, or realistic. I forgive though, its the first edition, always more to tweek it!"
4,Chicago,"I used to live in Chicago, and I can tell you that had I had this book back then, I would have visited lots of places I never knew existed or didn't fully appreciate at the time. As in most DK Travel Guides, there's lots of information, photos, maps and graphs.Sure, the book is a bit outdated, but then again, IT'S A BOOK! In any case, the good people at DK keep updating their books from time to time.I do have one complaint, in the fact that this book has less than half the pages that the New York book's got. Because it's less famous it doesn't mean that Chicago is less of a great city as the big apple is..."
5,Chicago by Eyewitness,Beautiful pictures. Accurate description. Wish it has a comprehensive map that includes suburbs (like Fodor's). And more information on the L train (map and how to take it).
2,Don't waste your time,"Not that I've reviewed that many different chicago travel guides, but this could be one of the worst travel guides in general I've ever reviewed. It was very difficult to navigate the guide as it was arranged by 'topic.' I guess I am used to multiple topics being arranged by 'area.'"
4,hollow but not hollow,"while i am a real agatha christie fan,some of her works really hit the spot in that not only is the mystery wonderful,bit the insight that she had on people and their actions.Indeed I felt this book,and the dvd, both to be a great anaysis of the human being,their actions,and how the society they keep,really mold their nature.Not to be missed by a true fan."
2,So so,"It started out to be an interesting mystery. However, Hercule stated talking so fast in the movie I could not understand what he was saying."
5,Some of the Finest Bar Music Available,"This is a great album to listen to when your out riding around with your friends on Saturday night. George's music is fun, energizing, and loud. The guitar is coarse, the drums loud and steady, and the sax is blaring--not polished but it sounds great. Most of the lyrics are simple and catchy, I'm sure you'll find yourself singing along. All of the tracks are good; this is the kind of album you let play straight through. My favorite tracks include, ""Move it on Over"", ""One Bourbon. . ."", and ""Louie to Frisco."" I never get tired of listening to it. Once I was in Circuit City trying out speakers and this was one of the albums I brought to test the speakers out with. A man of about fifty (I was 18) came up to me and asked ""Who is that and where did you get it?"" I told him and he said ""Wow that is some good old rock music."" He thanked me and went to look for it. That is how good it is."
3,Haircut was released after this CD was compiled.,"A previous reviewer asked why ""Get A Haircut"" didn't make this CD. It's because it was released after this hits CD was compiled.Anyway, this CD is a fine collection of songs by a fine artist. Nothing more, nothing less. As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is missing some key hits, most notably ""Madison Blues.""Enjoy!"
4,great slide work,"my fav tune is ""steady rollin' man"" but they are all good. this cd would be good at a party with adult beverages being served"
4,Great Read,This book is a great read for anyone in church ministry. It is a great reminder that we are the body of Christ and that we need to reach out to a people who do not yet know Him.
5,Where the church meets the world,This book explains and describes the direction in which every church is either going or needs to go to grow into the healthy church that God desires. The section on how Jesus really looks at those who have not yet made a committment to him is worth the purchase of the book.
4,Good,"I liked this book, my only complaint is sometimes i feel like Cole slams larger church's for not being the way he thinks they should be. I think all congregations have a place in this world and are all reaching people for Christ and making disciples how they feel God has called them to."
3,A timely and thought provoking read,"Neil Cole provides a stinging analysis of Western Christianity, challenging the foundations of traditional church life.He is obviously committed to the Organic Church concept, and his dedication to this new model shows in his passionate argument against centralized, building-based churches.Though some may consider his stance a little too radical, it is still worth examining. The book is worth reading for his exegetical and hermeneutical approach to Jesus' teaching on Church, and for several good sermon illustrations.I would say that even if you are not ready to throw aside all traditional church models, this work would still give you a good start on the proper thinking behind an effective small group ministry strategy."
5,"The new ""Gold Standard""","""Organic Church"" is the new gold standard for understanding simple/house church movements that are rapidly developing around the world. If the new church movements in North America are characterized by the DNA that Neil Cole describes in this book, namely: Divine Truth/Nuturing Relationships/Apostolic Mission, then the church is indeed moving in the right direction. This is a must read for those wanting to understand currently emerging house church movements."
4,Organic Church: Growing Faith Where Life Happens,It is a thought provoking book that helps you to re-evaluate what church really is and should be. It makes a great discussion starter.
5,Insightful Ideas and Perspectives,"Well written, full of stories, and insightful ideas about what church is really about by boiling down Western traditional church to its lowest denominator. Not a slam on the larger church nor denominations, but encouragements and truth that any church can strive for and accomplish no matter the size or people group!"
5,"Superb Summary of ""Missional Church""","I've been looking for a great summary of the missional church concept -- here I've finally found it. Neil Cole calls the reader back to the Biblical roots of church, cutting through traditional paradigms and dated ecclesiology. While maintaining a fresh relevance to the 21st century, the author communicates a way of doing church that is so Scriptural it appears new.This book is NOT another formula of how to organize, lead or manage a local church. Instead, it is a radical departure from a dying, dated ministry model to one that is Biblically sound yet culturally relevant. I recommend this book highly -- it's definitely a keeper for me!"
2,Read the first half.,"I loved the first half of this book, even though my parish is running from a far more traditional model. I felt that the course this book suggested could be integrated into a more traditional church for a more balanced approach.But the author just kept pushing the Organic idea so far that he stretched the metaphor. It got rather hard to deal with and distracting and I put the book down half way through. I'm glad for what I got out of it, but I just couldn't stomach the rest."
3,Supplemental reference book,"This is a good book as part of a basic home-church library. While written from the point of view of a person whose income comes from the home-church movement, it was most helpful in gaining deeper insight, more varied perspective, and a global viewpoint."
1,NOT FOR CBR 600RR,Does not fit 09 cbr 600rr. Brake lines must be coming out the bottom of handle bar to work. Also fits too snug between grip and handle bar causing it to constantly be locked. Probably ment for a cruiser so buyer beware....
5,Effective,"Easy to install. Took all of 10 minutes to install. I had to adjust tension a couple of times to get it just right as I did not want to get it too tight. Works great, will hold the throttle exactly where I lock it but yet you can easily twist the throttle while the device is still locked. Allows me to maintain speed better and stretch my right arm and hand from time to time. No hand and wrist fatigue and no fear of the throttle being ""locked""."
3,Works on bikes with standard sized grips only,"I ordered this hoping it would work on my 2011 Kaw 1400 Concours with heated grips but no such luck. The end of the grip nearest the throttle housing is to large of diameter and the wires incorporated in it hit the wider locking part of the device. It arrived in a timely fashion and was as described but I took the chance for 27 dollars it would work.If they redesigned the thicker part where it screws together 1/2"" farther out then it would be good for newer larger grips with the heated grips."
1,Poor design,"Tried to install on a Honda 2011 CB1000- ""fits"" but was frustrating, and stiffens the throttle too much- if it's loose enough to not affect the throttle, when not engaged, then it doesn't work. And if it's tight enough to work, it stiffens the throttle so much that it would hold it, even without the paddle engaged."
2,A little dissapointed.,"It kinda worked. In the off position, it had some drag returning to the zero point. In the full lock position, it would creep back toward zero. It's better than nothing, but barely."
5,The best so far.,"Lego Batman 7784 The Batmobile Ultimate Collectors' EditionI never regret buying this. I am a fan of Batman Mobile and LEGO, so this is a match made in Heaven. I fell in love with this work of art ever since I read it on STUFF magazine in 2007 and immediately set-off to a hunt for it. I just can't wait for LEGO to issue the UCS Batmobile Tumbler. I have so much fun putting this together. The attention to detail are excellent and the quality is a common high standard among LEGO's products. Every Batman fan should get this."
5,always simply the best,"Year after year I am so inspired by Jeanne's method of capturing the essence of ferrets. There is nothing cuter then a kit and once again she has given us the best photography along with the best subjects in the world, is there any wonder we wait for her calendars."
5,A MUST Buy Item!,If you like furry creatures of any kind you will LOVE this calender! Jeanne's photography is superb. She truly captures the spirit and love of life these little guys are famous for; all the expressions on those cute little faces are the real thing! You don't need to be a ferret person to appreciate this calender; one look at these faces and you will be hooked! Beware of ferret math!
5,Ferret babies a hit,"I write this review as my own ferret babies [now about 4 months old] romp and tussle across the floor at my feet. I've been getting (and giving) Ferret Calendars every year since Jeanne started making them, and each year I have favorite shots. And the 2006 calendar is no different. It's August. Oh, wait. Maybe September. No, December. Oh wait ... January. ;)If you have ferrets, you'll recognize yours. If you know someone who has ferrets, it's the perfect gift. If you know someone in ferret-free state or country who wants a ferret, get them the calendar instead. If you live in a ferret-free state/country, send one to a politician of choice."
5,Another ferret must-have,"High-quality, super adorable photos. These photos become classics in the ferret world and the calendars sell out so be sure to get yours."
2,Some of the worst dialogue ever,"I would not recommend this book. The plot is long, drawn out and repetitive. The dialogue, in some cases, truly immature. This is the first review I have written, though I have been reading romance for many years, some good and some bad. However, I got the feeling that Taylor was simply trying to fill pages here."
3,Seiko Men's Titanium Watch,"The watch is absolutely beautiful. But we returned it because it was difficult to read. The crystal had glare, so difficult to read in light, and not much contrast so difficult to read when darker. The size of the case seems smaller than many... so make sure it's the size you want."
2,Yawn....,"Kinda ""eh"". Pretty pretentious, self indulgent stuff. Worst of all, for them...a mediocre freshman album."
1,high rpm low IQ and whats new? Nothing here!,If you buy this fingerthing buy it on a rewriteable disk so its not a total loss.
4,Not as good as Season One,"Season Two was entertaining, but it didn't captivate me like Season One did. Maybe I need to watch the episodes a few more times. I agree with ""Mr Treize"" in that a lot of the episodes just stop at random spots, as if the episodes were written too long and just cut off at the 11 minute mark. The few stories that spanned multiple episodes were much better.One thing that has annoyed me since I got the first season is the censoring of the swear words. There are uncenssored bonus features, but not the main episodes. I get that it is necessary for TV, but I would like unrated episodes on DVD."
1,"content great, DVD not great","Great content, but the DVD doesn't work right. A few episodes stop in the middle, and the menu doesn't work right. It is like the content is too long for the DVD and it just ends.But, since I bought this along with season 1, and a few weeks before a birthday as a gift, by the time we found out the problem the window for returns was over! So, we are stuck with a incomplete second season.So, if you buy one, watch it right away in case something is wrong."
1,Came with only 1 dvd,"Got this the other day only to find there was only 1 dvd in the case, where there should be 2."
5,Brilliant!,"This show is absolutely fantastic. It's funny, exciting, incredibly detailed, has good plots and character development, and of course it has original music which is some of the best heavy metal available in this day & age.Season 2 is even better than season 1, and it really seems like the creators are starting to hit their stride. The music and special effects are better-developed, the jokes are funnier, and the episodes have better plots.I have watched all of the episodes at least 3 times, and now I am trying to get my friends to watch them because they're so good. I have been very happy with this DVD set! I hope they keep producing new episodes of Metalocalypse for many years."
4,funny,"Don't know what it is about this show, but it makes me chuckle when I watch it. So many goofy, irreverent moments; in addition to some very metal ones! Try it, you may like it."
1,Censored version?!?!,"I bought season 2 bundled up with 1 and three..... however, the discs say uncensored yet they are indeed censored. Disappointed."
5,These folks were cookin'!,"Some of the best electric blues sessions I've ever heard. You just have to shake your head at how in sync Hook and the Heat are, step for step, rocking this way, jumping that, wailing along. When JLH is moving up in a groove and hooks left, they're right there; when he hooks right, they're right there. Alan Wilson's harmonica is *such* a factor in how things hang together, whether he's in the background, shadowing Hook, or steppin' up solo. Be careful driving while listening to this one!"
3,Amazon hides the bitrate,"the music is classic and everyone should know that;but the dubious ""VBR"" of the download seems cheesy and Amazon does not reveal this before ordering/downloading."
5,Come back to 1970..,"I think this is really a good album. Buy it and you will go back to the early '70 years. In particular, I loved the songs in which Hooker play together with Alan Wilson: I have realised why Hooker considered ""Blind Owl"" as one of the best harmonica player ever heard. Canned Heat supported Hooker's music much more better than lots of other more known groups. Really nice."
3,Sizing???,"Would have liked to purchase, but there is no info on sizing! I hope that information will be added soon. :-("
5,Bing Sings Whilst Bregman Swings AAA++++,Great sounding version MFSL UltraDisc Gold II. I have several versions of this recording including on LP and this MoFi CD is the best sounding. Great product and a must have to collectors of Bing's recording and MFSL recordings. One of the best MFSL Gold CD recordings. AAA++++
1,defective remote,"This item was purchased a few years ago and worked well until the remote became unusable. The screen is unreadable, and, because of this, the chair cannot be used. The entire operation of the chair is dependent on the remote, and Body Care has no replacements and doesn't know where to get one. I would definitely not recommend this chair or any other from Body Care for that reason."
1,Why bother,"This re-issue really kills the album completely. It's only half of the live tracks, and none of the new studio tracks. And honestly, without the new studio tracks, there's really no point in bothering with this album."
4,2004 Reissue of Swallow this Live,"Swallow this Live was originally released in 1991 as a two disc set. Included on the two disc set were five studio tracks. Here we have a 2004 reissue from Capitol/EMI abridging the disc to where it can be a single CD. Besides the five studio tracks missing, there is also a drum solo and guitar solo, and the strange placement of Every Rose Has It's Thorn at the very end of the disc, as well as some of the profanity edited out. If you overlook the missing solo's and studio tracks, you're left with a decent live document of Poison's Flesh and Blood tour.In 1991 Poison was still at the top of their game, the single disc should satisfy casual fans, but hardcore fans would probably rather find a copy of the original two disc version."
3,Studio Tracks Might Make It Worthwhile To You,"Poison was a great band for one simple reason. Their songs made you feel good! This live album does not quite reflect how Poison made a stadium rock in the 80's, but it's kind of nice to have in your collection to remember the 80's. The studio tracks are fairly good, and justified my purchase of this CD."
5,The Music Industry Critics just don't get it.,"Poison is one of the Best Rock Bands ever and this Live album prooves it. Full of live energy and rythems that just keep you moving. This CD is not about trying to solve the social problems of the world. It's about fun and that is what music is all about. That's why they call it ENTERTAINMENT. It captures the energy of a live Poison show well. The bonus studio tracks such as ""So Tell Me Why"" rock. Poison is fun. This CD is fun. So buy it, listen, and enjoy."
4,C.C. DEVILLE SOUNDS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like the double live albums, but this one sounds incredible, in special the loud guitar of one of the best guitarists in the world: C.C. Deville. I like the Drum solo, it's sound great, but the drums sounds very low, Bret's voIce it's very powerfull and the bass and keyboards sounds incredible. One of my favorites tracks it's ""No more locki'n back"", it's a noizy song and, of course, C.C. solo it's LOUD."
1,why?,"I love Poison's music, but this CD was a joke!! Every hair band of the '80's had to have a live album and that is why I think they did it. The tracks are poor quality and add little to what we already loved about the songs in the first place. Buy ""The best off.."" or ""Look What the Cat Draged In!"" Trust me, save your money!!"
1,Simply awful.,"Buy Poision's studio albums, but avoid this live album. It is terrible. Seriously, I loved Poison in the 80s and they are a lot of fun to listen to, but avoid this. They sound terrible live and Bret Michaels' little introductions to each song are cheesy and dumb. Get Look What the Cat Dragged In, Open Up and Say Ahh, Flesh and Blood or Greatest Hits. Just do not waste your money on this."
1,This stinks,"Gee, there is a reason that a two-disc set is priced so low - it stinks. This is an awful album. If you want some decent Poison get there studio albums, but don't waste a cent on this."
2,Classic recording of them live..Where are the studio tracks?,"This came out in 1991 after the departure of C.C Deville and this was a good showing of them live added to this were bonus/studio tracks thus, making this a two cd set until now.There is no showing of these bonus tracks as well as the guitar/bass/drum solos sections that were on the old 2 cd set. Now this is all edited big time and you have to wonder why did Capitol/Emi do this when all the other bands that got reissues on this Label have all the songs plus bonus tracks. This is basically chopped up and ruined However, this could of been still the same 2 cd set Remastered/Reissued but these days this kinda thing is ruining the music industry so Thanks EMI..."
3,Post War II Seattle Blues,"Like Walter Moses, Curt Colbert uses the private eye genre to be an observer of changes at a transition period in American history. The book very slowly shows how the Jake Rossiter transforms from the accepted racism and sexism of the day to a more open individual. The book also uses several metaphors to keep the reader from escaping to mindless private eye musings simply for entertainment and zeroes in on the reality of a city that was very blue collar and pre-Microsoft. One huge flaw throughout is the banter and dialogue between Jake and Miss Jenkins his secretary. It was funny at the start of the book but by the middle it was an overused gimmick that bogged down the energy of a compelling tale. Very little character development, however the descriptions of Seattle are precise and accurate."
5,A Delightful BBBH Book,"Our 20 month old girl loves this book, she had no trouble lifting the flaps. It shows just how much fun getting dirty can be, it teaches children about animals that live in the dirt, things that need dirt to grow, and its just plain fun having fun in dirt. The book is very colorful, a delight for any Bear in the Big Blue House fan."
3,Frustrated With the Reductionism,"Overall, I liked the book but was really frustrated with the author's conclusions that lucid dreams can all be explained away as just mere brain activity: The typical scientific reductionism."
3,Absurd Affirmation,"Consider this affirmation:""The next time I'm dreaming, I will recognize that I'm dreaming.""The problem with this self-referential, paradoxical, circular reasoning, is that, when you ""wake up in a dream,"" you do NOT think, ""I am dreaming now, so what was it I was gonna recognize?""That's why you would need the last part in the first place. You need to recognize your dreaming FIRST, before you can prepare yourself for what to do when it happens.Instead, I would recommend you ask yourself while AWAKE, ""Am I dreaming?"" At every hour. Contract that habit and soon it will reside in residual droppings in your dream.Also get into the habit of flipping lights on and off. It won't work if your dreaming."
5,Great Start for Research!,"I searched for well over a month looking for a book or a magazine with any decent psychological information on lucid dreaming, I came up with nothing until I bought this book. It's wonderful! The authurs write so that the average person can read it and they have many different useful exercises to induce lucid dreaming. I found it so interesting I couldn't put the book down to even write notes! If you need a book on lucid dreaming this is the one."
3,Fascinating subject from a scientific perspective,"This is a decent overview and guidebook to lucid dreaming, from a researcher who appears to be well respected and is approaching a new-age-ish subject from a scientific perspective.The reason I don't rate this book higher is that it seems to be BOTH an overview and a guidebook, with no distinction in format or presentation. I personally found that I had trouble locating the intellectual information on research, theories, and implications when I wanted those, and the same with the how-to when I wanted that.I would advise those interested in this subject to stick to Dr. LaBerge's writings, and any similar authors grounded in scientific principles. The topic is rife with anecdotes and personal opinions; take advantage of anyone's objective research when you can."
5,"Practical tips, useful info on lucid dreaming","If you're looking for a way to have lucid dreams I highly recommend this book, it does not overload you with theory and has very practical advice and exercises for you to follow. This book worked very well for me. I would also suggest a supplement calledGalantamine Capsules 90 8mg Caps. I read how it enhances the minds ability to have out of body experiences while dreaming. I remember having my first lucid dream and it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. If your truly fascinated with lucid dreaming as I have become, I would also recommend readingLucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program. The two books overlap in some places but for the most part they are a perfect complement to each other. Happy dreaming!"
5,Very Inspiring!!,"This book is definately the book of inspiration. I have been interested in lucid dreaming before reading this book, but after this book was read, I became even more interested in lucid dreaming. I have only had a few lucid dreams since reading this book, but with more practice, I believe I will have more lucid dreams anytime I want."
4,Good Intro,"Was interested in lucid dreaming, and wanted a published source with alot of useful information.Was great, although in retrospect a little unnecessary, as there are more in depth ""tutorials"" on lucid dreaming forums that help more.But i'm really glad i have a lucid dreaming book i can read in bed before i sleep, gets my mind in the game. ;)"
5,Fantastic Introduction into Lucid Dreaming,"The book lays out the groundwork for many of the basic methods used for having lucid dreams, especially as a beginner. Keep in mind that you must work at this everyday over time and that reading the book over again will help you regain perspective on points that perhaps didn't register at first.My suggestion, people never fully relax enough before sleeping or preparing for LD techniques. Always relax to your fullest ability to do so before engaging in any technique in order to be able to move on with your progress.The book is a great value at the price you find it for here, if you're here reading this review, you shouldn't even think twice about getting it, just get it."
3,The Beginning Of The End?,"After releasing three consecutive first-rate albums(including the career-defining SWEETHEART'S DANCE), Pam Tillis released the first of what would be three consecutive good but not great albums. It's hard to say where ALL OF THIS LOVE goes wrong--again her choice of singles is impeccable('Deep Down', 'It's Lonely Out There')and she includes another tongue-in-cheek novelty in the vein of 'Cleopatra,Queen Of Denial'('Betty's Got A Bassboat') that isn't half bad. But none of the ballads here match her previous bests('Spilled Perfume', 'In Between Dances'), and though her take on Bruce Hornsby's 'Mandolin Rain' is literally inspired, the rest of the set,like much of her recent work, is just the opposite--pretty, but uninspired."
4,I wish this cd got more appreciation,"I really wish this cd had gotten the appreciation it deserved. Her cover of Mandolin Rain is exquisite and the River and the Highway, as well as Tequila Mockingbird are superb as well. I thought Betty Got A Bass Boat to be completely out of place, and is why I'm not giving the cd five stars. That said, Pam's voice shines on this album and it is well worth her talent and anyone's time to check out."
5,quality cd,"I like Pam Tillis and purchased this cd even though I didn't recognize the songs on it. However, it has turned out to be one of my favorite Pam Tillis cds."
4,Very good album,"Pam's 1995 album is great. Her cover of Bruce Hornsby's ""Mandolin Rain"" is especially good, with Marty Stuart playing the mandolin. This album has some great songs on it, a good mix of ballads and up-tempo. ""You can't have a good time without me"" has a great old honky tonk feel..(love the piano and fiddle)! ""Betty's got a bass boat"" is a fun song that was a hit for Pam. Reccommended!"
1,"Works, but not for long.","This racing wheel had great potential if it weren't for the quality problems. It's the only wheel I could find that has analog paddle levers. And it's priced reasonably. The wheel works well for the first 20 to 30 plays, but quickly degenerates to the point where it can no longer be used. The problem is with the steering and paddle analog circuits. After a few plays, the wheel will return sporadic values as you turn the wheel and apply the paddle levers, making it useless. Once the wheel begins degenerating, there's nothing that can fix it, not even calibration. I work at a game development company and we have purchased nearly 20 of these wheels and they are all beginning to fail. We're not hard on the wheels; in fact, we use them with care. Nevertheless, we have had to replace every one. I cannot recommend this wheel."
3,"Good compilation, but some disappointing...","I thought this one CD could tell almost everything about Tina. But many songs here were not original album versions but edited (single) versions. So they are not very tasty to listen to. Particularly, ""Better Be Good To Me"" and ""Private Dancer"", my favorites, were disappointingly shortened. I would rather have bought the hottest album ""Private Dancer""."
5,not all there,"I love Tina and this collection is very good for either long time fans or newbies.I bought this CD back in '91 when it was released and it has 17 tracks listed and River Deep,Mountain High is NOT one of them.Some of the reviewers list it and mention it but my copy doesn't include it.Weird huh?"
4,the woman has soul,this disc show cases here 80's and early 90's hey day and that's great considering all shes been thru.while her stuff with ike is fantastic this disc does have good moments.i'm glad to see a legend such as tina continue to do what she does best.she can take songs and pour her heart right into them.that's not taught that's soul.and though the material might not always capture it to the fullest the lady is bad.
2,Disappointed,In this CD. After I heard the poor quality of the recording and rendition of the songs I wished I could return it and get my money back! Tiny sound and lots of static on the CD. Also not the quality of performances I am use to w/Tina Turner in the past.
3,Hilarious!!!!!,"Tina Turner is soooooooooooooooo funny! She doesn't mean to be, but she is! A Tina Turner concert must be like stand-up comedy with Jenine Gerafelo or Chris Rock. Listen to this album whener you have a crappy day and Tina Turner will make you laugh and laugh and you probably won't stop years from then!"
3,Misses the mark somewhat,"Tina Turner is brilliant, that is a given. But this 'greatest hits' or 'Best Of' misses the mark in some respects. For starters, it only includes one big hit from the 70's (Nutbush City Limits) and that is remixed! What about ""Acid Queen"" or "" Proud Mary""?Thankfully, they have included the original of the 1966 hit ""River Deep, Mountain High"". Tina did several re-recordings of this classic - yet none of them match the magic of Phil Spector's work on the 1966 version.This collection is similar to other compilations, in that it also includes brand new tracks (at the time of release). I hate it when record companies do this. This is valuable space that could have been used for the classics that have been omitted.For casual fans only. True fans will want the ""Private Dancer"" album."
2,why release this ???,"Last year Capitol released ""Simply the best"" on DVD and a lot of fans were very disappointed with it. The 1991 laserdisc release had even more tracks on it then the new DVD release???Capitol/EMI should release a complete video anthology of Turner starting with ""Ball of confusion"" from 1982 to ""Whatever you need"" in 2000 ! Why release this cd/combo set ? only for die hard fans who want to spend money and get nothing extra. I'm a very big Turner fan, but I am going to pass on this one..."
5,She is simple the best,Love this album wish I had the opportunity to see her in concert. I use this as a workout album.
3,Actresses spent more on surgery than the studio on the DVD,"The film is everything I remember from the VHS edition I saw in the early '90s. If you are a fan of this genre, you have probably seen this movie, and understand what made it special, namely, totally gratuitous nude scenes that last for minutes on end. It's often like an extended naked music video.Lamentably, the DVD appears to have been mastered from a VHS copy, or something similar, because the picture is not nearly as clear or sharp as any standard mainstream DVD release. It's not unwatchable, but it is disappointingly dim. The three star rating is for the DVD, not the film, although, to be fair, if you were to judge this film on everything but the girls, it would be considered terrible."
2,Beach Babes in Bikinis,"Bikini Summer is one hour and twenty-nine minutes and was released on September 19, 1991. The movie is cheesy, the plot does not exist, and the females are cute. Basically you have a bunch of females wearing next to nothing bikinis and in some scenes they are nude. Only in the last half hour do you have any kind of story what so ever. You are better off renting the movie or ask a friend to make a copy for you. Bikini Summer gets a D- and the beach babes get a B+.PlayChaptersPreviewsA. Alien IntruderB. The Art of DyingC.

2,lots of flesh,I purchased the movie because of Melinda Armstrong. I was not disappointed Melinda is out of sight even though the movie is a stinker.
2,Movie Easy To Forget,"I didn't really like this movie that much. The movie is about guys looking at women, taking pictures of them, and peeping through holes watching them take showers. The women look nice in bikinis, and I guess that is suppose to be the premise of movie, the title says so, women in bikinis galore. I don't really remember the movie that much, I guess that's how forgetful it was. It ends with a bikini contest that the cops try to stop, and how it gets resolved seems stupid, and in the end a female cop gets to try on a bikini as if to say the contest wasn't all that corrupt or illegal. Plus, none of the women are really that pretty, though they have nice bodies."
4,It's 5 stars Remixed,"Okay, so you buy this expecting the club version of Spin Spin Sugar. You're truly disappointed that it's not on this CD. All is not lost. There are plenty of good tracks still."
4,Listen to the whole CD,"Of course I bought this CD for ""6 Underground"", but it has long been my habit to listen to the whole CD. And I was definitely not disappointed. I have been playing it in my truck more or less continuously for the past few weeks. ""Low Place Like Home"" and ""Spin Spin Sugar"" were good, ""How Do"" was great (she has a great voice), and ""Post-Modern Sleaze"" is easily my favorite (after ""6 Under"", natch). The mixing of the India-style flute/instruments with Western music is SO hot."
4,Why the negativity?,"sure, this album isn't anything groundbreaking, but saying that one band is trying to _copy_ another group is insulting and base at best. Garbage never posessed anything but an annoying collection of gituar riffs, a drum machine and a lead singer (in my _humble_ opinion), whereas sneaker pimps' becoming x seems to hold elements of originality and ... wow ... good music."
3,three decent tracks; rest average,"The Sneaker Pimps have a nice electronic sound that evokes a bit of the Curve (female lead singer and all) but without the dark vibe really. ""low Place Like Home,"" ""6 Underground"" and ""Spin Spin Sugar"" are real; standouts. The rest to my ears were just pleasant background sounds and very forgettable."
3,Sneaker's a bit dated debut,"""Becoming x"" sounds today a bit dated,mostly because trip-hop genre was specified long ago.That is true,Sneaker pimps sound unique on ""Bloodsport"" and also on ""Splinter"" but their popular debut is not showing at all their skills.The fact is that Trip-hop was something original then and now Snekaer Pimp's on here are sounding like something between the band's like Garbage,Massive atack and Portishead.""6 underground"",""Tesko suicide"",""Waterbaby"",""Spin spin sugar"" or ""Roll on"" are combinig electronic beats with some guitars and Kelli's sweet vocals (she is singing here instead of Chris Corner who plays here on guitars).but all these songs are just good.listen to it without any excitment.there are few gems here like ""Low place like home"", ""Walking zero"" or amazing ""How do"" but all in all ""Becoming x"" is nothing more like another trip-hop album.I enjoyed their other albums a lot.this one is featuring some fine tracks but is not impressing at all."
3,Hint of greatness to come,"If you were searching desperately for any good music during the 90's like me, you found Becoming X a refreshing bit of creativity. It has a very melodic sound without being too cheesy. Just cool enough to be alternative. Fortunately, Chris Corner had sense enough to see a much more serious future for the band."
1,Another one-hit wonder in the making...,"I thought Sneaker Pimps really had something going when I first heard ""6 Underground"", but then when I heard the rest of the CD, I was very glad that I didn't buy the CD and just heard someone else's copy of it. The songs are nothing like ""6 Underground"" and are lacking in both originality and artistic talent. Not a good buy. If you bought the CD, then you probably find yourself skipping through the entire CD and listening to the last song which was a remix by another artist. The original is almost terrifying. The rest of the CD is just garbage."
3,Eh... it's ok.,"I bought this CD b/c I remembered it from a long time ago when it first came out, but, I have to admit, I was disappointed. The songs didn't really grab me like I remembered. 2 great songs: Spin Spin Sugar and Six Underground are wonderful! It's the stuff in between that you'll hear, memorize and maybe tap a toe or two to, but not your whole foot."
4,Fan at 1st Listen,"I became aware of this group about 6 years ago when I saw the video for ""6 Underground."" I instantly became a fan! This album infuses the lead's voice over bass, drums, synthesizers, etc. The songs make you feel something deep within your soul like ""Post-Modern Queen"" and ""No Place Like Home."" I recommend this album as an introduction to anyone who wants to know what electronica and trip hop is about."
5,kelly dayton rocks!,"This is an instant classic!Every song is original and I listen to it regularly even today(3 years later).These albums are rare.I hate to say it, but ""Becoming X"" is the best album the Sneaker Pimps will ever put out.They should've never fired Kelly.She didn't MAKE the band, but she did add the final touches needed to make the band GREAT.Chris may have good vocals, but Kelly's is better.Their music and her voice just gelled together nicely. Listening to them now...something's missing.You would think so too if singers were missing in bands like Tool, Radiohead, Mr. Bungle, Pearl Jam, etc.That initial impression stays with you."
4,Better than most,"While some songs fall a bit flat, and some lyrics make you scratch your head, the overall effect is very original, and there are a few songs that work very well. Let's keep in mind that this was their FIRST album. Good to have in your collection."
4,Straightforward trip-hop?,"This record is a really enjoyable listen, but overall it lacks the more challenging dark elements that attract me to trip-hop, and the somewhat related ethereal/shoegazer genres. Still, I'd recommend this album."
3,Sugar Spinning is Lacking,"This CD is nice and has great grit. But if you are looking for something really special, get the [IMPORT] version of the CD instead...it's grittier and the Spin Spin Sugar is FANTASTIC...no crying or weirdness...just truly gritty groove...it's indescribable. This version of the CD is just a little 'light'."
3,Sneaker Pimps-Becoming X,"This was a breath of fresh air in 1997. The Sneaker Pimps are the awkward cousins of Garbage and the neighbors of Everything But The Girl, and as they march toward their latest release Blood Sport, they come with pretty decent material under their belt. Becoming X is a smooth, ambient-laced odyssey that at times seems so right and others just unnecessary and too sleepy for its own good. The best stuff is at the top of the disc: ""Low Place Like Home"", ""Tesko Suicide"", ""Six Underground"", and the title track. They all have their own charm though, mixing a punky attitude in some places, folky guitar in some, and Nyquil-ish trance in the others. One of those albums that starts off great and loses steam toward the end. Worth purchasing for the mentioned songs, and a few other elements. Maybe the electronic boom is passing. Who knows? Maybe Blood Sport and Moby's upcoming 18 can save the rave."
5,A hypnotic masterpeice,"I have to say that this is one of my favorite CDs. Anyone thinking of buying this CD should go for it. The music is so beautiful and hypnotic, and gives you an unexplainable feeling. Kelli Dayton's vocals are one of the most unique in the bussiness, and it's a shame she split from the band. The two best songs on the album are, ""Spin Spin Sugar,"" and, ""6 Underground,"" which both just ooze sex. The haunting, ""How Do,"" is also one to look at. The CD gets my highest recommendation."
2,Binding is inadequate and pages falling out from chapter eight,"The book is informative and covered my class cirricula. The problem occered when the instructor assigned chapters 7, 8, and 9. Halfway through chapter 8 I saw a page was coming out of the book, it was page 290. In the last week three more pages have separated from the binding. The binding is breaking down and pages are detaching. The book is great, but the construction is inadequate, especially for the price.I have been buying my textbooks from Amazon since July of 2009 when I began my degree programs and have never had this issue with paperback/soft cover books."
5,Best Media Law Book,"This book not only offers a wonderful one chapter summary of the American legal system but also a great overview of Media law in terms that don't require a law degree to understand. I wouldn't encourage reading this outside of a classroom setting but if you are reading it for a class it can really help to supplement the ideas of the professor. Also, anyone who says this book does not need to be republished frequently clearly is missing a fundamental point of media law: the mass media and the law are ALWAYS changing. Year to year, and sometimes month to month, new laws are made and new standards set. Since you are probably reading this text as an undergrad you will already be years behind current standards and new laws when you enter your profession (if you don't keep up on your own that is). Imagine how far behind you'll be or lost in class you'll be if you buy a previous edition of this book. They do change critically, if only slightly, from edition to edition."
5,A Serious Masterpiece,"Unlike plainsong, which can provide meditative background music for work, prayer or reading, I believe Part's work demands -- and richly rewards -- full attention and involvement. By turns somber and sublime, the music evokes the mystical experience of the Russian Orthodox Church, and for me, cannot be separated from the religious experience of the liturgy it embodies."
2,Yummy scent but pretty ordinary product,"Small bottle of sweet scented watery and fairly ordinary body moisturizer There are plenty of better ones around. Would suit a young, naturally.oily skinned girl. Rose scent not one for the boys!!"
4,Welded incorrectly,"I ordered this item from Niagara Cycle, but it was welded incorrectly. I contacted Niagara Cycle via email, they sent me a new one in about a week and a half at no charge to me."
3,Bare bones but one of the only options out there for a really tall stem,"Quality of this stem is not great. I had to lap the handlebar clamp area to get it to grip the bar hard enough. Any tighter and I think it will break. Other than that issue it appears to work well. It is cheap and very tall, which is exactly what I was looking for."
1,Buyer beware.. Dangerous for your animals.,"Recieved the puppy playpen today. After opening the box and having to bend one of the sides back into shape in order for the sides to fit into place this was nothing close to our expectations especially for the price. One is better off purchasing the cheapy puppyplaypen on ebay for half the price.This pen came bent on one side. Without enforcing it somehow or using tie straps for the top it is very dangerous for your puppies as the top does not fit very snug and will easily collapse and fall inside the crate and hurt your puppies. This playpen is poorly designed,dangerous and will hurt your pups. The bottom pan is very flimsy. Overall cheaper material and workmanship than the cheap 69 dollar no name puppyplaypen you can buy on ebay.Do not buy. We do not recomend it one bit."
5,Great book...,"I bought this book about a year after college, when I wanted to come up with a plan to get rid of some credit card debt and begin saving money. This guide is fun and interesting, yet informative. It guides you step-by-step through good personal finance habits, and allows you to prioritize what goals you have for the future. The most insightful to me was when it asks you to name the things you spend that LEAST contribute to your happiness and MOST contribute to your happiness. I.E. - it's not wasteful if the spending improves your quality of life - versus you're just spending to spend! The workbook section asks you to guess how much you spend on things each month and then actually track your spending for 6 months to help you develop a realistic budget & see how you did. It's definitely a wake-up call to people like me, who seemed to piddle their money away without realizing exactly where it's going. This exercise helps you find the answer to that question!"
4,Get ready to work - and think!,"This is a great work book that makes you think as well as work. If a person with out of control finances will take the time to diligently follow the steps, I believe this book will be very helpful to them. Understanding is always the key to fixing a problem. Highly recommended!- Aimee Elizabeth, Author of How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
1,PNY 6600 AGP FAILED in 2 Wks.,"After two weeks of intense gaming using Battlefield 2 (BF2) the video card FAILED.Catastrophic failure-- as in blank screen without the possibility to re-boot system. I replaced the video card, and system boots fine. I'd have to give this graphics card two thumbs down, with a buyer BEWARE caution. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Good while it lasted,"The card replaced a Radeon 9550 256 mb and it was very good. Image quality and gameplay were greatly enhanced by using this card. However, after 10 months of use, the card died. I wasn't able to boot into the computer and now I'm stuck with integrated graphics (until I get a new one). The Radeon never gave any problems and I had it for a year and three months. Previous to that I had another Nvidia card (32 mb, can't remember which one) that was good for three years."
1,Not worth your time.,"This is the singularly most boring, uninspired, cheaply produced mess I have ever seen. It is nothing but badly edited clips from poor quality trailers with an insipid narration. Do not waste your time and money."
2,Cheaply Done,"This DVD set on the Ladies, as well as the companion set on Leading Men, are done exactly the same, on the cheap. Using public domain footage from movie trailers, old movies and tv shows and some ameatur footage taken of the more recent stars, the quality of this set is poor. This is basically a DVD release of a VHS series of the 1990s called ""Hollywood Remembers,"" and using the exact same footage. Photos, when used in this documentary, are filmed out of books or magazines...very poor quality all around. DO NOT expect A&E type Bios here."
1,don't get this version,"As a windows 98se user trying to find something more stable, I was horribly disapointed in the Discovery pack. Things were easy enough until I got to the modem...Mandrake is very light on their modem support, I couldn't get drivers out of them for either of 2 modems I had (Intel and Conexant). Tech support was absolutely useless, and even after downloading a Linuxant driver with windows and getting it installed I still can not get a dial tone. The worst thing about this distribution is that you can't compile anything--they left those programs out. The best way to describe the interface is insultingly stupid, but to get anything done you have to be versed in Linux command line jargon, which is incredibly complicated even for an experienced DOS user. My advice, if you want to ditch Windows buy a computer with Linux installed and forget all these hassles."
4,Great introduction to Lua,"Lua isn't a complicated language, honestly. If you're coming at it from another language, especially ones with simpler syntaxes like PHP or VB, you'll feel right at home. In fact, it's so simple you could easily pick up most of the language's workings just by looking at other people's code, and building your own from there. That said, not everyone likes to learn that way. Some people, myself included, like to have a reference book that they can pick up at a whim, skim to the topic that they're struggling with and find a solution. That's what this book excels at: reference, and teaching by example. It's a great buy for anyone looking to get into Lua scripting, and a nice reference guide for those already fluent in other languages."
3,Doesn't fit a cuiser bike,"I gave it three stars because it looked and felt sturdy, unfortunately I had to return it since it did not fit my 1950's classic cruiser. I opted for the Schwinn Rocket Ray Rear Rack (Model #SROCKRRCP1)"
5,"Good product, reasonable price",Great product and a good price. Received it at a reasonable time and it fit pefectly on my daughter's bike. I would recommend this product and vendor to anyone.
2,"Difficult to figure out, doesn't fit, requires way too much rigging!","I didn't really look at the reviews for this before I bought it, because I figured back racks are all the same. Well, I should have, because apparently I was wrong. The rack was a total pain to install, and didn't come with either instructions OR enough hardware to complete the job. After so much time spent trying to put it on my bike, and several trips to the hardware store to get enough parts to get it to actually fit on my bike, I looked at it today and realized that the flimsy extender piece will probably not even allow the rack to carry that much weight safely. Grrrrr! Unless you have a lot of time on your hands to waste or don't get frustrated easily, then I'd look for a different rack. This one's a really terrible piece of work."
1,Far too flexy,"I've been commuting all winter using this steel rack, and steel Wald baskets too, and I finally switched back to an old aluminum rack. The Wald steel rack is fine in itself, but it mounts in front with a very flimsy bracket that is held to the rack with one small screw and bolt. This is entirely insufficient, and leads to a wobbly rack system.A bike rack is generally useless unless it can be firmly mounted to the seat stays of the frame. My commuter bike doesn't have eyelets for mounting a rack, but many racks are sold with little adapter fittings that can attach to the seat stays. The Wald rack would be greatly improved if it could be mounted this way. But even if it could, the rack is made of very soft steel, and the rack itself is still quite flexible.Buy a cheap aluminum rack instead, you'll have far fewer problems!"
5,"The Rack for a 27"" Bike!","See this link... ([...]) This rack is designed to mount to the rear brake assy. See photos I posted. Do your research first. This rack was NOT designed for most of today's newer bikes. This rack was designed for the ""Old School"" bikes with 27"" wheels, such as a Schwinn Varsity or World Sport. I installed mine on a Fuji Sagres 12 speed made roughly in the early to mid 80's. Instructions? Who needs 'em? This is easy to install - it took me about 15 minutes...tops. The connecting brace attaches to the rear brake assembly. Just take off the rear reflector & put the brace where the bracket for the old reflector was. You can then attach the reflector to the rear of the rack when completed. While you're at it...buy a new Avenir Saddle (seat).Avenir Groove Dual Saddle (Black/Grey, Groove Dual (M))"
1,Does not fit,"I bought this for a Schwinn Cruiser. The rack itself looks ok. As the other reviewers said, the hardware is a joke. After reading some of the other reviews I was under the false impression that the mounting bracket was not included so I ordered one.WRONG! It is included so I wasted some money there.I don,t know if I should take the time and expense of returning this rack. The main problem is the struts are not placed wide enough to clear the wide cruiser fenders. I would have to cut out the sides of the fenders or use pliers to bend them in. Forget it.The customer submitted picture on the rack on a Schwinn cruiser says it fits,""really snug"". That is an understatement.It just does not fit and you have to muscle it and risk damage to your fender.This is not a one size fits all rack. Do not buy unless you are sure it will fit your particular bike."
4,Good rack...not so good hardware.,"I purchased this rack along with the recommended hardware and all I can say is that it was useless to get it. It already came with a set (accident?). The nuts and bolts that it did come with were way to short for them to work on my Schwinn mountain bike. I am going to have to go to the hardware store to purchase 3 new nuts and bolts to make it work. Installation was pretty straightforward after figuring out what direction the bike rack was suppose to face. I would purchase again, just without the hardware pack."
1,Good idea...doesn't fit newer bikes.,"This rack didn't fit my bike. I got it to hold the Wald Grocery Baskets, but had to send it back."
1,NO DIRECTIONS - DO NOT BUY,"THIS THING COMES WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS WHATSOVER - YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF. COME ON, HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO PUT A SLIP OF PAPER WITH DIRECTIONS. DO NOT BUY IT - IMPOSSIBE TO FIGURE IT OUT."
2,SO many complaints and frustrations...,"First of all, the product description on this site doesn't really specify what type of bike is preferable for this rack. My husband has a 26 inch, mountain bike, and the rack doesn't fit on his bike.Second of all, the product arrives without a single word of instructions. I searched on-line to find the most ambiguous, confusing, and useless instructions ever written on the manufacturer's web-site.Needless to say, I returned this product.The only positive thing I can say about this product is that it is much stronger than the bike rack my husband ended up buying (which I'm expecting will snap in two any day now)."
4,Does the job,"Nice product; works as advertised. Use it to support two side baskets for carting my stuff to work and does well for that purpose. Only complaint is that might need to get a lock washer as my riding takes me over some bumpy paved roads and the screw/nut holding the support to my bike began to loosen, but after screwing down with a lock washer in place I haven't had any issues since then."
3,Bike Rack,The bike rack itself is very good quality. It would be better if the screws came with the type of nut that locks. Mine fell off on a bumpy road throwing me to the ground
2,Does Not Fit My Bike,"I have the same problems as others have listed on here. The screws and extra piece are both too short to mount to my road bike. Also, no instructions, so I wasted a half hour trying to install it on my bike only to realize that it wasn't going to happen."
5,The only one that worked for me...,"I have an old Nishiki road bike- from the 80s or so- and I looked everywhere to find a bike rack that would fit on it. This one is perfect! I didn't have to change a thing on my bike to install it. All I did was move the reflector and everything was perfect. I've been using it for over a month now and I have had no problems with it. I use it almost every day to carry books, groceries, climbing gear, you name it (I have saddle bags on it) and it functions perfectly. Highly recommended."
2,Beans,"Excellent children's book, cute story, etc. Have shared book with several friends and all comment on the great reading and how much they have enjoyed."
4,One of soul music's great unknowns.,"L.V. Johnson was mostly unknown but he certainly deserved better. His very gruff yet passionate, Deep-soul flavored style made him a good soul ballad interpreter and songs like ""Take A Little Time To Know Her"" and ""Are You Serious?"" are proof of this."
5,Fascinating look at marraige and welfare culture in NYC,"Fascinating. An entry into NYC Jewish history, domestic life, and the pressures for immigrants to conform to American concepts of men's roles in society and the vulnerability of women. Read it for some quick research -- and got hooked."
4,"We've missed you, Ian!","Echo and the Bunnymen relived, even better than the new Echo! Ian and Will do an amazing job on this one, with an element unseen for a long while. ""Feel my Pulse"" the opener, is definitely a jam! Ian fans, get this CD, you won't be sorry. I had the opportunity to see Electrafixion live from about 5 feet away, and boy do I miss them! ""Burned"", ""Zephyr"", and ""Sister Pain"" are my favorites. GET THIS BEFORE IT'S UNAVAILABLE!!"
4,Great album!,It took no time to get delivered and cost me less than $3. The music is great. I just want to find someone that can teach me the guitar parts in the songs!
3,Interesting work from Ian McCulloch,"This album is a bit repetitive. But it is interesting work if you are a big Echo and the Bunnymen fan as I am. I highly recommend it to the collector type. If you hold Echo off at arms length as say a ""greatest hits listener"", this album is probably not of interest to you."
3,"not that bad, but not that great...","Anyway, if the new B-Men album is just Mac & Will, how come this doesn't count? Well, maybe it shouldn't--it's really not a great album. Sure it's loud, but it lacks the great ferocious intensity that marked early Bunnymen albums. Songs like Feel My Pulse and Never are halfway decent, but as a whole the album is fairly unremarkable, and mainly good for B-men completists."
1,Buyer Beware!,Beware!! This price is for one box of 12 bars!! This was previously amazons price for three boxes!! I have contaced amazon and was told that this is not a mistake!! Just a price increase!!

4,"Challenging, good disc!","I had a hard time getting into this album. I listened to it probably 5+ times over at least 6 months before it clicked. When I first listened to it, my ears hurt too much and I couldn't pull out any sort of sense from it. Suddenly one day (the one I promised would be the ""last chance"" this disc had) it clicked, and I loved it. It reminds me a lot of Skinny Puppy, but with more static on top and at a more frenetic pace (if that's possible). If at first you hate it... wait and keep giving it a try, because once it clicks you'll realize what a great album this is!"
3,ONLY FOR STUDENTS!!!!!!!!!,"BE CAREFUL!!! The artist should be listed as Jamey Abersold -- Oliver Nelson is NOT the artist on this CD. Amazon should relabel their product. This CD is for students of jazz who are trying to learn how to play their own solos. This is NOT for casual listening, rather for close study."
1,Wrong Listing,"This listing is for the Aebersold Play-Along, not the correct Oliver Nelson CD 'Stolen Moments' available as a Japanese import from ejazzlines."
1,WRONG ITEM,"The GREAT Oliver Nelson album, titles ""Stolen Moments"" was recorded In Los Angeles: March 6, 1975. The artists on the album are Bobby Bryant (tp,flhrn); Jerome Richardson (ss,f,pic); Oliver Nelson (as,arr); Buddy Collette, Bobby Bryant Jr. (ts,f); Jack Nimitz (bs); Mike Wofford (p,el-p); Chuck Domanico (el-b); Shelly Manne (d).

4,Again in the USSR,"I had a friend who was chief designer for Lada-- no big distinction, that, if you've ever seen one-- and he sent me lots of records at my request. I wanted Russian rock, but he sent me this Pol Makkartni record anyway! Anyway, I never played it until yesterday, so it's been on the shelf since at least 1990. Pretty decent effort, nice trubute to the classic stuff. I suppose the original Melodiya vinyls are hard to come by after all these years. My son is a bass player and a big Beatles fan, so I suppose I should give it to him. Anyway, the title CHOBA B CCCP literally means ""Again in the USSR."" Someone up above was wondering what it actually translated to."
2,"Not that bad, but English title is ludicrous.","I didn't really mind the songs on this album. They reminded me a lot of the Star Club tapes or the Decca auditions (although not as memorable). Also, none of the songs are better than the originals. One of the things I found hilarious about this album was that the title was translated from the Cyrillic alphabet as Choba B CCCP. ""Back in the USSR"" would be Snova v (ignoring the fact that on the cover of the album they use the letter 'á' rather than '') SSSR in English. Choba isn't even a word as far as I know. Considering they phoneticize most other translated titles of foreign works, it's beyond me why those chose to just copy the letters off the title as best they could and ignore the fact that the Cyrillic alphabet is not all that similar to the Latin one we use in English."
3,Really Fun,"I found this LP at a garage sale for $1, and I basically got it because it was Soviet and unusual. Apparently Paul McCartney make this record specifically for the Soviets post Glasnost, and it's not a compilation. As far as music goes, I wasn't expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's really good, and I usually find Paul McCartney kinda annoying."
2,Not McCartney's Best Effort,"Nobody is a bigger fan of Macca than myself, but this album is not one of his best. It sounds more like a sound test than an inspired homage to his childhood musical influences. I don't hear enthusiasm in his voice, and the music sounds too polished. It really lacks soul if nothing else. Run Devil Run, a similar effort, is everything this album is not: raw, full of energy, and clearly a labor of love. To me RDR is far superior to this collection."
3,It's OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like and don't like, But it has some good stuff on it. It just seems to go on and on."
2,"Good Idea, Pedestrian Execution","McCartney singing rock, pop and jazz classics sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately, these arrangements are ordinary, and the recording sounds sloppy. A shame."
2,ZZZZZZ! Snore! ZZZZZ!,"McCartney's voice is in outstanding form and the musicianship on the album is excellent, but the album bores me. I'd rather have an album of original McCartney material, rather than him doing cover tunes of songs from the 1950's."
3,A little lacking,"I was hopeing for some sentences. I ended up getting the names of certain things. I was disappointed, this is the most basic preschool korean tutorial you can buy. The sound bytes were relatively poor. I was wanting to see the english pronunciation of the word also, but it wasnt there. I would recomend this cd if you wanted to learn how to say hello, goodbye, appologize or identify an object in korean."
1,Nearly useless for anyone seeking information on DXM,"This book represents the worst of opportunistic publishings; the title implies that the authors present an authoritative overview of DXM dependence with solid sources for further investigation. However, this work is merely a compilation of drug-dependence resources available to anyone with a phonebook or a library card. The information specific to DXM is minimal and the ""sources"" are simply internet ""hits"" the authors found and may or may not be available at any given time; The reader would be best served by a one-page monograph detailing what is known about the drug, and the PubMed/Medline URLs to BEGIN a search on authoritative medical information. The authors miss many published works that better describe the drug and research to date (see ""The Chemistry of Mind Altering Drugs"" by Daniel Perrine, among others.) Highly disapointing. A reliable and accessible sourcebook is sorely needed."
4,bought for someone else,"I bought this book for someone else. I have no idea whether it's good. I'll give it four stars so I don't hurt its average, but I can't offer a recommendation."
4,A Must Read For Youth Workers,"You will either use the information the way you find it in the book or it will serve as a catalyst for you to develop your own ""checkpoints"". We are redesigning the content of our youth talks immediately based on Stanley's Seven Checkpoints."
5,A wise choice,"Kids face so many difficult challenges in today's chaotic culture. Andy Stanley talks practically and from the heart to help teens to live victoriously in the middle of this generation. One especially helpful checkpoint is encouraging teens to make wise choices and showing them how. Rather than telling kids that they're making wrong choices, they can consider making the wisest choice in any situation. This builds them up rather than cutting them down. It nourishes the spirit rather than stifling them."
4,quality,This is great book with a great game plan. No plan is a plan to fail. As a student pastor you must intentionally plan for the future. This is a great guide. Pick it up.
2,More crunches.,"This book has a wonderful introduction, explaining why strong core muscles (abs & lower back) are necessary for athletic performance, however, the exercises explained in the book are simply variations of a crunch. After 3 months of doing the exercises in this book religously, I felt that I had made very little gain, and in fact I felt as if my posture was becoming worse and worse. The authors definetly realize the importance of the core, but they do nothing to help with strengthening it."
4,Exercises for a stronger core,"The book contained everything I needed to work on toning my core muscles without injuring myself. It explains what muscles the exercises work, the correct sequence in which to do the exercises and why. Stretching and cool down exercises are included."
2,little disappointed,"Little disappointed with this book...elementary material..I suppose its good for beginners, but if you are looking for hard core workouts..I found better stuff surfing the net."
3,lot of exercises,This book shows all sorts of different kinds of workout for the abs and lower back. You can pick what works for you.
1,disapointing and worthless,"OK, I lost my old book of snowflakes and the wife was upset so I saw this one and ordered it. It does have some nice patterns. What it DOES NOT have is any way at all of following them. Each pattern page shows a large picture of the snowflake with a tiny triangle of the pattern in the corner. (Yes I've done these before and I know the pattern is smaller). the point is, you can't copy it onto paper to cut out. Unles of course you scan it, then enlarge, ect ect.... it doesn't even show the pattern on grid lines so that you could make a resonable guess at how you were cutting. So, we have a pattern that isn't to scale, has no gridlines, and you can't copy onto a piece of paper to cut out. Like I said. Pretty patterns, but wortless as a book to actually accomplish cutting them out without a lot of extra work. Hint to author - Make an 8-11 page with the guide on it already. this format is just dumb."
2,"Difficult patterns, not easy to copy",Unlike other paper snowflake books I have the patterns in this book are difficult to copy and to cut. The directions for each snowflake are not as clear as in other books.
2,snowflakes for all seasons,"No the bang for the buck, should be no more than $5.Small book but ok directions.I would probably not recomend this book."
3,Kindle edition is wonky,"I bought this as a resource to use in making my own designs. It will work fine for that, as I can take a basic fold and basic structure and branch off from there. That's why I'm fine with the Kindle edition, and don't need designs to trace. HOWEVER.... the Kindle edition is wonky in that the title shown on each page is for the image on the previous page (for ex, the title on the Love Birds page says Tulip Garden, which is the design from the previous page and the Lovebirds image is titled Flying Kites). It's an error in pagination, but would have been very simple to proof and fix. Note: this is the effect on Kindle for PC - I've not looked at the book on my Kindle, as I don't plan to use it there.The designs are ok - no better or worse than the ones on my Kirigami calender from a few years ago, but are more suited for children than adults. I use this type of design element in doing surface design on fabric."
3,Good introduction to Black Metal for what it's worth...,"A ""mainstream"" overview of Black Metal hosted by Jasmin St. Clair. While she may not be hard on the eyes she definitely doesn't know ALL there is to know about Black Metal yet. I think her heart is in the right place though so I give her props for that. The interviews on here are not bad & the videos are all professional & very well done, almost as if you were watching videos on channels like VH1 (if they ever played anything ""good"", ha ha). Anyway, the ""kulter than thou"" Black Metal crowd will NOT enjoy this at all, as all of the bands featured on here are probably ""sell-outs"" in their opinion, but for someone just getting into the Black Metal scene it's a pretty good introduction."
4,Witchblade and Samurai Japan,"With its focus on a mystical weapon, the combination of Witchblade and samurai Japan is a natural one. In the contemporary Witchblade story line about the wielder Sara Pezzini, Nottingham presents himself as a kind of Western samurai. So I was delighted to see this historical Japanese treatment of Witchblade by Fiona Avery. The art is beautiful. There is also a short story appended about a Japanese Witchblade wielder and a master of the tea ceremony that was very wonderful."
5,Beautiful........,"Students, parents, historians, architects, professors...this book is for you! This comprehensive tour guide is just what you need to stroll the grounds and surrounding area of UVA. The writing is superior; the beautiful photographs distinguish this from any other tour book of the university! Buy this for the new student OR the graduate!"
5,THIS IS A MUST READ!!!,I'm going to visit the Glensheen mansion this fall and so I picked up the book hoping it would fill me in a little about the history of the mansion and the murder and boy did it ever! This was a page turner from the beginning and I didn't put it down until it was finished. Experiencing Glensheen will be all the better thanks to this book.The story is so unbelievable it's hard to believe it's not fiction!Sharon Hendry did a wonderful job!
3,Slight Overview,"After reading the masterful, and one might say ""definitive"" account in WILL TO MURDERhttp://www.amazon.com/Will-Murder-Surrounding-Glensheen-Killings/dp/188731735X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_cI started reading this book looking for more details on the psychology of Marjorie Condon. However, this is not that book. Everything here was covered in more depth and detail in WILL TO MURDER, which I would recommend highly rather than this slight overview."
1,Awful!,"The child who sings the songs is way off tune and it sounds like she is singing to a karoke machine. Unless you like high pitched off key crooning, don't buy this album. There are much better CD's out for kids today."
4,THIS IS DIFFERENT,"THIS CD, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RELATIVELY NEW LOS STRAIGHTJACKET CD ""TWIST PARTY"", ARE THEIR MOST DIFFERENT OUTPUTS OF MUSIC SINCE THEIR COLLABORATION WITH EDDIE ""THE CHIEF"" CLEARWATER ON THE CD ""ROCK AND ROLL CITY"". WHILE IT IS DIFFERENT AND NOT WHAT YOU WOULD USUALLY EXPECT FROM A L.S. CD, IT IS GREAT. A COMPILATION OF 1960'S POP SONGS SUNG IN SPANISH WITH EXCELLENT BACKUP, IT IS DONE RIGHT AND THE MORE YOU HEAR IT, THE MORE YOU WILL ENJOY IT. I LIKE ANY CD BY LOS STRAIGHTJACKETS, AND THEY ARE EVEN BETTER TO SEE LIVE THAN TO HEAR ON A DISC."
1,What a disappointment!,"A new Los Straitjackets CD? Produced by Cesar Rojas? Sounds like a winning combo doesn't it?'Fraid not mi amigos. This CD is a major work of spam. Absolutley no originality and not even a trace ofenthusiasum. I'm sorry..I am a fan of Rojas and the masked men, but this is not a work too be proud of.Lackluster vocals by Lil Willie G and even less effort from Big Sandy. Pass on this one carnales."
2,What about Excel for Mac 2011 users,"The Author assumes you have drivers for various database sources such as MS SQL, MS OLAP, dBase, Oracle, Paradox etc as part of your default Excel installation.I am using Excel for Mac 2011 which does not come with these drivers in the default installation, so you cannot follow the book's examples or use the online files without coughing up for extra drivers from 3rd party suppliers.The Author is not responsible for shortcomings in Excel for Mac 2011 (vs Excel on other platforms) but he should be aware of them, acknowledge them and give advice on the best way to overcome them."
5,Highly recommend this book!,"Our company has been trying to implement data cubes and PivotTable reports, but we were struggling with the implementation. After reading this book, I finally understood how the multitude of options can actually be 'applied' to develop powerful reports. For example, the author shows how you can specify beginning and ending dates to refresh report data, change database locations and even query multiple databases on different servers. The coverage on the MS Query program, web-enabled reports and data options is by far the best out there. And if you're looking for a book that really uses SQL, this is it!"
5,Love It,"Uncle Willie K, a wonderful Hawaiian singer. I love his rendition of O'Holy Night, and Ave Maria, just simply Beautiful!"
2,Wolfe leaves you wondering what he's doing too long,"I lost interest during this complicated story, mainly because the reader is left too much in the dark. Only in the last couple of pages does Archie figure out how Wolfe was figuring out the mystery all along. There were a lot of details to attempt to follow, and they weren't interesting enough for me to care. As usual, the dialog between Wolfe and Goodwin is the high point of the book, but I want Archie to be more involved in the solution."
2,"Sorry, but not for me","This is the first Nero Wolfe book I've read, and it bored the heck out of me. Perhaps I should have started with something lighter, but I didn't and years from now, after having a few more NW reads under my belt, may have to return to it. I just couldn't keep track of everyone -- who was a part of this organization and who was a part of that -- and I really didn't give a rip about any of the characters. So, after plodding through exactly half of it, I skipped to the last chapter and called it a day. With so many Nero Wolfe fanatics out there, though, I'm convinced that I shouldn't give up. There must be something about him. The book I'm currently reading (""Might As Well Be Dead"") is a much easier read and may actually turn me into a fan."
3,Cafe De Paris,"All I can say is that the previous reviewer must have cloth ears! No, it's not necessarily background music. The CD is a distillation of bal musette classics that originally were anthologised on the Parisian Fremeaux label. As such it's a handy introduction to the world of bal musette accordion and some of its greatest stars. It's not afraid to deal with the end of the music influenced by the amalgam of swing and manouche gypsy jazz. As for the sound I found nothing wrong with it- no rice krispies effects- and I go back to it again and again."
3,This is a collection of pieces from the 1930s.,"This disc is an anthology of pieces played by top accordion groups of the 1930's in Paris. As such, it has quite an ""old-timey"" sound style-wise and recording-wise. Some numbers also have vocalists. It's good background or atmosphere music."
5,Evocative of the cobblestoned streets of Europe,"To paraphrase a bumpersticker: ""Use an accordion, go to France.""French accordion music is very specifically French; you won't hear dorky polkas or Cajun/Italian/Irish/cowboy music here. This music is so purely evocative of the feeling you have in Europe: cobblestoned streets; cafés at night filled with chatting, laughing people; and time that encompasses a line back into history. Or at least back fifty years, when men wore their hats frontwards, and women wore gloves. It's a lush recording. You'll feel like your passport has been stamped: FRANCE."
5,My affair with musette started here,"I bought it as a joke some years ago, but boy was I seduced. Accordion music is extruded cheese, right? Wrong.In the hands of virtuosi like Gus Viseur, Tony Murena and Guerino, this music jumps something wonderful. Not to mention the Reinhardt brothers and others on guitar, Grappelli on violin, Piaf and Jean Gabin singing. These folk play up a storm. (And if you thought swing was a purely American phenomenon, you'd be mistaken.)It's as good an introduction to the poignant, humorous, sophisticated world of pre-war French popular music as you'll find."
1,Beware: Disappointing sound quality,"This CD is terribly marred by the crackly, tinny recordings. I was not aware how spoiled I am by modern recording technology until I heard this CD. I was totally disappointed by the quality of the recordings. I expected them to be remastered not sounding like they were taped from grandmere's old albums. I don't even listen to it because it is so bad. I'm still looking for some good French background music, because this cd is not it."
5,Enjoyable book,I have enjoyed paging through this book and gathering ideas for our math learning time in homeschool. There are wonderful projects for young children that would still not bore a slightly older child. Both my boys can learn together and no one feels it's too hard/easy for them. There are also tips given to make a project harder or easier if needed.
4,Very Good CD,This CD has a nice bunch of different Ska songs. It gives the listener a chance to hear several different groups. All are really good songs that make you feel (as a previous reviewer put it) happy. Definitely worth buying.
3,"Close, but no cigar....","Even though this is a nice collection of ""original ska"", there seems to be something lacking. After a bit of thought, I realized that quite a few of these songs were later covered by two-tone bands...I dont think I like that. There are so many good songs out there..much better than ""Longshot Kick De Bucket"". I do appreciate ""Housewive's Choice"" and ""Miss Jamaica"" though. But you know what's really missing form this album? PHYLLIS DILLON!!"
3,Better deal at local grocery store,"Bought this hoping for a great deal. Didn't realize that the packets are pretty small. If you wait for a sale at your grocery store, you can get a better deal. Not by much though, if it matters to you."
4,very informative,"A very good book filled with useful information and pictures. Helped with my small block rebuid. Could use an index. Sometimes you needed to search through a couple chapters to find specific (example: setting the valves) information, thus 4 stars. I would recommend."
4,"Very good ""how-to""","I previewed this book in the library and wanted a copy for my own. It is a real good book with plenty of pictures and explanations showing you where to start, what to look for and then what to do prior to assembly. What you save in doing some or all of the labor and asking the right questions of your machine shop will more than pay for this book that's a keeper."
1,Disappointing plot,Had chases but not spectacular.Only one was good because four cars were wrecked in the chase.
4,West Coast Underground Hip-Hop,"Not sense Souls of Mischief, has the west caost underground been as dope as this CD. I purchased Rasco CD and loved it. Planet Asia, I've heard a lot of on underground radio and mix tapes. Now these two have joined forces to form the Cali Agents. This CD is bangin and should be in all underground hip hop heads collection. This CD has a west coast vibe to it and both of these kats got madd lyrical skills. It's begining to sound like a cliché to say go get this one, but get it anyway.oNe"
3,Not Quite...,"Okay Planet Asia: Dope, Rasco: Dope, Cali Agents: Not as dope. I don't know what happened, I've heard them come off way tighter on mix tapes and comps, this just doesn't seem to be their best. It's not a bad album by any means but not that good either. The best song I would say is track 6, Neva Forget. I can't say I would of bought this album again, but if you really feel them go ahead and get it."
1,asia is tight...,with his style but this album sucks.worst album i have by far.rasco is so wack it hurts.
4,Factual and interesting,"This is the kind of information I am gathering in my ancestry search. While this particular Lewis Tackett is not my direct ancestor, I did learn he is definitely related. My 5X great grandfather was a brother to his father. I found it very interesting that there was a fort built bearing our family name not far from where I grew up. It gave me insight to the kinds of dangers faced as our forefathers forged their way into new territories in early America, and the stamina it took to press onward for the better cause.Dianne Tackett Oliver"
3,"Lewis tacket of Fort Tackett, VA (now WV)","A historical novel. Based on historical events, but dramatized. Nonetheless, it given an accurate representation of the early settlers of the Kanawha Valley in present-day WV. The people were real; the events are recorded in many sources; the conversations, obviously, are necessarily what might have been said."
5,The Great Man in His Prime,"""You're Telling Me"" (1934) is 67 minutes of vintage W.C. Fields - a total delight from start to finish. Along with the variation of his classic golf routine, the scenes featuring Fields' invention of bullet-proof rubber are among the comedian's finest. And let's not forget the ostrich! Universal Home Video should be releasing more of the Great Man's Paramount films. What's taking them so long?"
2,Only thing rolling is the Sea,"This is one of those love or hate it books. The writing style is dense and borders on Dickens. The guy in the big dark coat and hat wandering the decks at night, etc. If you like older literature and the way it flows you'll probably love this book. Certainly the setting and period detail feels spot on. The dialogue and plot flow on the other hand is there but not driving you along. I picked up and put this book down 4 times before finishing. There was no sense of wonder whats happening next."
3,"Ok, but not great","I picked up this book because is was on the Wall Street Journal's list of summer books. And while I find a lot of the WSJ recommendations good, I had to disagree with this one. Although the author has come up with a great plot, the telling of it leaves something to be desired, at least as a summer read is concerned. The author does well slowing revealing the pasts of the central characters - the characters are all intertwined in ways that they know and don't, and the setting of Ireland and a transatlantic boat trip are unusual ones. But this wasn't an easy book to read, with the author trying to go for an authentic mid-1800 tone. The language was difficult to digest while sitting by the pool in the hot sun. In a nutshell: story good, ease of readability bad. Bangkok 8 is a much better summer read."
5,Excelllent,Simply one of the best books I have read in a long time. You wont want to put it down. Congrats to Mr. O'Connor>
5,Wonderful,"A fascinating story, part political history, part tragic adventure story. Tremendous characters and superbly written."
3,Too clever by half,"O'Connor's novel is extremely well researched and will be informative for those who do not know that the famine in Ireland was a very bad thing. The novel is set on board a ship sailing to the New World at this shameful time in history. Using flashbacks and excerpts from ""recovered documents"", the lives of the passengers are woven together in a ""penny dreadful"" murder mystery. After an atmospheric and gripping opening, O'Connor lets the novel drift. Characters are thinly drawn and behave inconsistently. The clever resourceful villain behaves like a whimpering fool to facilitate the surprise ending. The sprinklings of Latin (most of us have forgotten what we learned) and the silliness of having one of his characters sketch the plot of Oliver Twist for Dickens were irritating. It felt as if Mr O'Connor had a screenplay with blockbuster appeal in mind. It could have been a great novel. Perhaps the film will be better."
1,Worst book of the year....,"I only finished reading it as it was a book club assignment. Although the history was very interesting...not only what happened in Ireland with the potato famine but the blockade of the ships carrying refugees into NY City's harbors, the book was disjointed and hard to read. It seemed like the author either put down his pen for a while and then picked it up and added new past history about his characters or...his editors told him that he had to make the book longer. I did not find the characters believable. The only person I cared about besides poor Mary Duane was the ship captain who was forced to carry so many passengers and buried a huge percentage of them at sea. I could not wait to finish so I could get on to better books...life is short and there are too many wonderful treasures yet to read plus old classics to read again. This book was neither a treasure and will not become a classic."
5,Great book for kids,My kids loved this book. They wanted it read over and over. They each wanted copies now that they are adults.
5,A classic that today's kids still really love,"Classics get to be that way for a reason, because they are great books! My sons just love this book, as I did as a child. The wonderful story of how Mr. and Mrs. Mallard found a home is really fun to read. I also like it that this book is set in the city---it's hard to find good picture books for city dwelling kids. Many kid's book seem to assume that everyone lives in idealized suburbia. My older son loves the names of the ducklings---kids getting close to reading seem to love to play with rhymes, and it's fun to say Jack, Kack, Lack and on up to Quack! I wish you happy reading of this one!"
5,The story of how an entire city stops to care for a Mama duck and her babies,"This is a wonderfully illustrated story of a Mama Duck in the city of Boston who stops traffic as she seeks to take her babies across the street to the park. It is masterfully written by the author Robert McCloskey (read another book of McCloskye's, Homer Price)."
5,Great Childhood Memories!,"My parents read this book to me when I was young. It is my favorite book ever. I would place this book among Goodnight Moon and the Velveteen Rabbit as the best children's books ever written. I plan on keeping this book for many years to read to my children and grandchildren. Then maybe, when ever they see a mother duck and her babies, they will think of the kind-faced officer, stopping traffic for them to cross the street, just as I do now."
2,didn't like it,"Got this as a gift. Not my cup of tea, the illustrations are nice but the story doesn't hold my childs attention at all."
2,Frustrating for Kids,"I bought with book with the idea that it was going to help my children with reading like the books we had as kids. I loved this book as a kid! So to my dismay, they don't have a ""beep"" sound to signal the kids to turn the page. This lead to major frustration with my son who is learning to read but wanted to at least keep up with the story. He was listening but was on the wrong page and said he didn't like the book b/c he was ""getting lost"". Too bad the removed the page turning notification, b/c I would have given it 5 stars! Just buy the book and read it aloud yourself b/c by the time they can read themselves they arent going to want someone else to read it!"
1,Defective book,"Make Way for Ducklings is one of my favorite children's books. I purchased it as a gift on 12/26 for the granddaughter of a dear friend of mine. I wasn't able to give the gift immediately but finally presented it in mid-January. I just discovered that the book was defective...I guess the recipient didn't want to hurt my feelings by letting me know right away. It's too late to return it, but I want you to be aware of it. There were pages missing, pages out of order and the book restarted again in the middle."
1,eh..not impressed with condition,"it seems that the company i bought this from has a different idea of what ""good"" condition is than i do. the picture of the book you see is not the book i got in the mail. the book i got had no pic on the front and looked like it was from 1950. crayon color on the inside. i will not use this book distributor again."
4,"Calm and old-fashioned, in a good way","There are lots of funny, fun, frantic, colorful, silly books out there to tickle your young reader's fancy. But a calm, sepia toned, gentle tale also has its place on the shelf. And this one works without strain or any false notes. It's a nice change of pace, and sort of a mood piece, but for the right kid at the right time it could make a strong positive impression."
5,Make Way for Ducklings,Before wrapping the book Make Way for Ducklings I read the book out loud as if reading to a child and found it absolutely delightful.
5,A classic for a reason,"This book was read to me, and I read it endlessly to my little sister and my daughter. Now I am reading it to my great-nephew, age three and a half, who fell instantly in love with it. He always lets out a little ""whew!"" of relief when Mrs Mallard and the ducklings make it through the gates of the Public Gardens. After about the fourth reading (there were two on that particular day) we went to a little park nearby where he insisted on playing out the story with me, complete with Mr and Mrs Mallard's dialogue. It is a ritual now.This is an astonishingly involving book for small children. There is a practical but manageable level of threat (of traffic, which is very real and genuinely important for three and four year olds) with the assurance of adult help when it is needed, and the constant reassurance that they are being looked after. And adults can read it forever without getting bored!"
5,A delightful Story,A very delightful story with magnificent illustrations. I believe that children as well as adults of all ages will enjoy reading about Mrs.Mallard and how she finds the perfect home for her family.
4,Good story,"This is a nice tale of a family of ducks finding their place in the world. We have the hard back version and the ""book on tape"" and both of my children like it. Nice to pair with The Trumpet of the Swan as part of this book is also set in Boston."
3,A well-prepared travell,"Judging by this book, Pierre Ramond must be somebody who spends more time packing his suitcases than travelling. He must therefore be a very well-prepared and careful traveller. Two-thirds of ""Journeys Beyond the Standard Model"" is devoted to the Standard Model of fundamental particle interactions. Considerable understanding can be revealed by undertaking the journeys described in Pierre Ramond's book, provided the traveller invests in the Standard Model groundwork excellently surveyed in the book's initial chapters.Gian Francesco Giudice/ Theoretical Physics Division, CERNA complete review is available in CERN Courier, June 2000"
5,Album of the year 2003,"Blackie and the Rodeo Kings was CKUA's number one album of the year for 2003 and it was my number one album too. This roots rock endeavor for Steven Fearing, Colin Linden and Tom Wilson has a great full sound for a mere three piece band. But if you are lucky enough to hear them do the same songs unplugged, the music stands up beautifully without all the effects and thunder.The lyrics are wicked and insightful. ""I got a feeling stinging like a new tatoo black across my mind"" -- (from Water Or Gasoline by Blackie and the Rodeo Kings). Moods range from rockabilly to ballads to psychadelic rock. BARK is gonna jump up and bite you.If you only buy one album in the next while, this is the one to get."
1,Cheap-Z !!,This product un-less I'm greatly mistaken has no E-mail virus protection. That's why it's a VALUE !! After installing this product I looked for E-mail scanning and found none also after running a scan it said that it could not scan 48 files with no explanation why. Scary thought wouldn't you think !!
2,Low-priced...but not very effective...,"I ws very happy that I got one of the free downloads of this product when it was launched and was more than ready to buy next year's subscription as this is a light-weight product and is not intrusive.My wife opened an e-mail containing the Win32.Netsky worm and voila, the system was infected. How I came to know? This AV reported that system's winlogon.exe is corrupted.I don't understand why the AV did not stop the worm even though it's real-time protection was on!I had to go through multiple levels of scanning before I disinfected the system (Thanks to XP's system restore which sves the worm infected files also).I had Autodownload on and I have cable modem, so if the data files for this worm would have come in time I would not have had two days of wasted time. This is something that never happened when I had McAfee..."
2,Technical flaws (returned),"This dvd has great color and good sound (as long as it is playing). However, the disc stops and the player reports that the disc cannot be played. I will return this disc."
1,Probably for only the most diehard Catherine Cookson fans,"Although I've always known of Catherine Cookson, for whatever reason I've never read any of her books. So I recently decided to give her a try, and picked up The Cultured Handmaiden. I did not finish the book, but quite about one-fourth of the way through. While I didn't hate this book, I definitely didn't love it, either, and since a Catherine Cookson fan has since told me that her historicals are much better, I've decided to wait and try one of those, instead. I've found that authors tend to be good at either historicals or contemporaries, but almost never is an author good at both.I'm giving it one star not because it was so absolutely terrible, but because if a book is DNF it automatically gets one star from me.I suspect that only the most diehard Catherine Cookson fans would enjoy this book. It definitely has a different ""feel"" to it that I think most American readers would probably find ""foreign."""
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I registered for this set for our wedding,and like a previous reviewer, was very excited to receive it. I love the style and weight, but the VERY FIRST TIME I washed them (just after taking them out of the package), they came out of the dishwasher with rust spots all over many of the pieces. I am disgusted with the quality of so-called ""stainless steel"" flatware. It is definitely NOT worth the cost."
2,"Nice shapes, bad metal","These are fairly comfortable in the hand and have a good mouth feel. They are medium-weight and reasonably priced. Out of the box they have a very pretty satin metal finish.Unfortunately, the choice of metal alloy is not good and over time they take on a poor appearance. They are prone to small rust spots after about a year of regular use including the dishwasher. That's annoying but can be taken off with polishing. What's worse is that the metal starts out shiny but turns to a dull gray. However, wherever the metal will be shiny wherever it has been scratched recently. As a result, the pieces end up an ugly mix of old oxidation and shiny new scratches.I recommend you pass on these and look for a set with some nickel in the alloy, such as ""18/10"" stainless steel."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I loved this flatware and registered for it for our wedding. We received the set (which I was VERY excited to receive), but in a couple of months, the set rusted! It looks terrible and I'm sure isn't very sanitary. I've been dealing with Hampton Forge for nearly a year to try to get a replacement set! I wish I would have kept my last set which still looked brand new after many years! Save the money."
2,Didn't even make it a year,"Very disappointed in this movie player. It has failed after 9 months of occasional use. It says no disc. I can't find my sales receipt from when I bought it and their website says I need it even if I had registered it orginally.Trying a different brand now, hope it lasts longer."
3,Strictly for research,"The purpose of my purchase is for a research class. Although I have no aversion to research, I am not looking forward to working with the teacher for this class. . . however, I will strive to be positive. I do enjoy reading and the work involved with researching languages. This book indicates that it is research for second languages so I'm sure I'll find it interesting although I have only skimmed thru it thus far."
3,Useful to a degree,"The 201 verbs in this book are all conjugated in the affirmative. Only sample conjugations are provided for affirmative interrogative, negative, and negative interrogative forms in all tenses.Still a useful learning tool and reference, but not complete in the way that ""fully conjugated in all the tenses"" might lead you to believe."
3,Somewhat helpful,"It's not as much help as such lists are for Indo-European languages, but with Turkish you need all the help you can get. I've been working through the Pollards' ""Teach Yourself Turkish"" (and by the way, to get the tapes for that you have to go to the U.K. Amazon.com) and it was helpful in recognizing strange words that are not glossed and turn out to be unfamilar verb forms that a dictionary would not give you.The problem is that Turkish is so completely different from French or German in its entire structure that you have to learn completely different concepts. As a simple example a verb is changed to a negative form by putting a syllable in the middle of it. I haven't yet figured the vowel harmony thing. I'm still planning my trip to Turkey for October."
2,"Confusing explanations, too few examples","The book describes the tenses, but fails to give enough translated examples of most of them. I frequently had to go to other texts to find out which tense to use. What do the terms ""Indefinite past, Necessity, Optative, Conditional"" etc mean? I can guess, but I can't be sure. This book might be useful as a spelling aid, because the manner of adding endings to verb roots can be difficult at first, but it leaves the student with almost as many questions as answers. The explanation of vowel harmony is too brief, and lacks sufficient examples. You will need to read about vowel harmony elsewhere,Also missing are the common idioms which are found on each page of the ""501 Verbs"" books published by Barrons Educational Series."
3,Burn calories while you eat...,"For the price, you might be afraid that you're getting flimsy silverware that you can bend in half with your bare hands. Fear not! This is probably the sturdiest (and heaviest) silverware I have ever used. I feel like I can skip the gym after eating a meal with this stuff. Heavy duty silverware is nice, but this might be taking things a little too far.Other than that, the style is attractive enough, and it really is quite a deal for $15 if you can still get it at that price. Just don't expect any small children to handle the weight and size of the silverware very well."
2,Make this book your last choice,"I had the displeasure of using this textbook in my Technical Writing course at the local university. This author lacked depth in his discussions on all the topics. That probably explains the addition of supplemental course material. The examples used in this textbook were acceptable, but I was still left hanging with ""what if"" questions unanswered. The organization of this book also needs some improvement. On a positive note (yes there is a positive side to this), I found the Appendix very useful as a reference guide, though."
1,Clear-Concise-Simple,"The key to technical writing is best described as clear-concise-simple. The most accurate review of this book is to simply add NOT to each of these goals.It is NOT Clear - NOT Concise - Not Simple. It does boast one quality. It is vastly overpriced.The writers style is easy to describe. It is very much like those bookshelf size computer manuals that we have all come to know and ""love"" so well!"
1,Doesn't fit the P7000,"Listed as a case for the Nikon Coolpix P7000. Unfortunately it is too small and, therefore unless for the purpose."
3,Not for P7000,"This case is listed as fitting the Nikon P7000 camera. It does not. You can squeeze it in width-wise, but the cover doesn't even come close to closing. Do not order this case if you want to use it for a P7000."
3,"CAES IS GOOD, BUT ORDERED A SPARE BATTERY & WAS SHIPPED 2 & HAVE HAD PROBLEM RETURNING ONE & ALSO A CANON BATTERY CHARGER- ORDE","Case was okay, but received 2 batteries -ordered one & a Canon battery charger- which I don't need. Returned it to Cameta camera & said it wasn't theirs, so they returned it to me. It's confusing at Amazon- when you ship from different companies. This was my first Amazon order- and probably my last."
5,Great DVD for students and LMTs,"If you do not have it, buy it. Detail oriented DVD that helpful for a lot of cases. I learn a lot from it."
5,full of techniques and knowledge,"I am a massage therapist works for Massage Envy in Indianapolis, and I purchased more than 3 dozens of DVDs concerning massage and bodywork; those two deep tissue DVDs (extremity and torso) are my favorite. I learned so much and come back to watch them again and again, each time I learned more new things. My clients and coworkers (who traded massage with me) told me that I exceeded their expectations and I received many requests for a newcomer (less than 2 months of employment). I found some scratch on my 'torso' DVD and I contacted the company, they sent me a replacement DVD within the same day of receiving my email. Great service too. I appreciate their professionalism and highly recommend their top notch products. Thank you.If I could afford only two DVDs of massage technique, I'll certainly buy those two. Thank you again."
3,Good Intro to NMT,"Deep Tissue by Sean Riehl means Neuromuscular Therapy (NMT) as Leon Chaitow, which is different from Art Riggs' Deep Tissue Massage, which is direct myofascial release. Good introduction to NMT, Sean narrated the theory and showing the techniques in a clear and systematic way, almost textbook. The computer graphics is excellent. As with other videos from Real Bodywork each section is ended with a summary and quiz."
4,Modern Day Fairy Tale,"I think that this book was above all else a beautiful story that I enjoyed every second of. I agree with the reviewers who claim alot was glossed over. But I think that it was still a beautiful story about a truly beautiful (inside and out) woman who has lived an above-average life. I also really feel, despite questions about accuracy, that she gives an Arab perspective on the Middle East that you don't often hear in America. But above all else it really is a King and I, Grace Kelly type story taking place in a totally foreign, exotic, and unstable region. I personally was inspired by Queen Noor's choices and work with the people and the wonderful things she and her husband achieved."
1,Queen Noor? or King Hussein?!,"the book basically glorified King Husseins ""acheivements"". Queen Noor did not write much about herself, but rather about her late husband and Jordan. suprisingly, coming from the queen of jordan, some of her middle east historical facts are wrong!"
2,Queen Noor,"The book is intriguing. I think at 26 marrying a King, she needed a father figure. She did not know any other faith but Islam. She did not have spiritual upbringing while growing up."
1,Propoganda Plus,Truthfully I did not finish this book. It was an autobiography (or memoir) that states the writer's opinions as fact. She was born after the Israeli wars but describes them as if she was present at the time. Queen Noor's disdain (if not hatred) for Israel glares from every page.
3,Memoir?,"The book was very bias and strongly motivated by Queen Noor's personal beliefs. I would have liked for the book to include some detail on her personal life, however she limited the contents to include only stories of history and political proceedings. Because of this, the book tended to drag on. She clearly had a great respect for her husband and liked to include him in every thought. If it weren't for her picture on the cover, one might think the book was the King's memoirs."
4,A new perspective,"It was fascinating to read the story of an American woman becoming a middle eastern queen and her enduring love for King Hussein. However this is much more than a love story. Queen Noor provides a unique view of the Palistinian - Israeli conflict and the Arab view of Americans. She communicates this without being preachy or judgmental, with an understanding of both the Arab and American worlds."
2,no depth of character,"I was looking so forward to reading this book due to my interest in middle eastern culture and my love for biographies. As a book on middle eastern culture it appears very one sided and ignores many truths by vilifying Isreal. It ignores the fact that so many middle eastern rulers were tyrants and still supported by her husband (eg.sadam hussein). As a biography it was SO shallow. I never had even a slight feel of who she is as a person and what her family problems were. It appears before she was married all she did was go to school, ride horses, and work. Did she ever have a boyfriend prior? who knows. You won't get anything interesting from this book. If you are going to write a biography you should open up more."
4,Fun read,"Her writing is very earnest. I like her voice. Overall I liked King Abdullah's memoir better, but this was an insightful and fun read too."
5,An extraordinary book,"One of the challenges of life is to imagine walking a mile in another person's shoes. Queen Noor stepped into an impossible pair of shoes and takes us all with her on an amazing journey. Combining a Love Story with the complexity of Middle East politics is not easy, but the author does it with grace and warmth."
5,An honest history of Jordan and her life with King Hussein,"I have only started to devour this book but already I am completely enraptured by it. I think Queen Noor's account of Jordan's history so far is very honest. At first I was a little confused by the course the text was taking as she was getting more and more into Jordanian history, but now I am completely taken by this book. It is very important for the world (especially the US) to understand what has happened in this part of the world and how it contributed to where we are today and I commend her for attempting to educate the world."
5,The Other Door Opens,"Queen Noor's book was an eye-opener. Jordan to me has always been somewhat of a neutral country in the middle east, nothing really came to mind when I thought of Jordan, now I have a clearer picture.QN does a good job of shedding light on her life and that of the King as well as the political issues of the day. The other thing she does was enlighten the reader on the challenges facing her as a woman in the Jordanian society as well as being a wife to the King.All in all, this book gave me a new perspective on Jordan and I am looking forward to visiting that lovely country."
5,What an eye opener,This is a book to enjoy from beginning to end. Filled with facts not before known but often suspected in the way politians arrive at decisions that are not best for the country nor the world but bring the most money into their next run for office. Everyone should read.
2,The Official View of My Life as Queen Noor,Leap of Faith is interesting from the young all American becomes Queen standpoint. It really is amazing that a fairly regular young American woman gains the attention of the King of Jordan and becomes Queen.It is too bad she was not willing to be more real in her telling of a great story.The book ends up preaching about Queen Noor's view of the political world and quickly becomes tiresome and boring.It could have been a very exciting story given her exciting life but she had to go preach to us instead.
3,Not as Expected,When reading a memoir of someone I expect it to revolve around them. I was a bit disappointed in that this book seemed to revolve aroung Noors position to her husband. There was some discussion about her and her feelings but I felt the majority was about politics and her husband.
2,Worth reading - in parts,"I confess that I was expecting a fairy tale of sorts. I didn't get it. I found the book hard to read for 2 reasons: it abounds with names that I couldn't keep track of, and the language does not flow for me. I don't know if it was partly ghostwritten, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't - and it's pretty clear that Lisa Halaby, aka Queen Noor al Hussein, has been mostly speaking Arabic for many years.I didn't read the entire book - put it down midway and doubt I'll ever pick it up again. I'm sure her life has been interesting, but it just doesn't seem well-told. However, I believe her attempt to put forward the Arab point of view on the Middle Eastern conflict is valuable."
1,Cold and unrevealing,"This book is a disappointment. To call it an autobiography is misleading, since Queen Noor offers no genuine intimacy or personal revelation. The text is aloof and guarded and amateurish. I'll wait for a serious biography."
1,Very Disappointing: Queen Noor,"This book is a reminder why not to buy an autobiography. Queen Noor insults the intelligence of the reader by promulgating her strongly bias view of events and history. Please do not write any more books, Your Majesty, stick to fashion or social events. I feel I have wasted my money with this purchase. If you don't believe me, read a few chapters online or in the store. A rating of 1 star is too high."
2,"Absurd, but not horrible","It was difficult to fairly rank this book because, although I personally thought it was one of the most absurd pieces of literature I have ever had the courage to read until the end, some still will gravitate to this pretty memoire written by the regal Queen Noor. This is an absurd book, but not horrible. I know that a lot of people, mainly aging, white American women who are uneducated in world cultures and captivated by royal life will find this a classy read."
1,Not a Book Insight,"I have YET to receive my book from this bookseller.....its been 3 weeks and counting..... wish I COULD write a review on the book, guess I will have to go to Barnes and Noble to read it...."
3,Not a true memoir,"Queen Noor is still a loyal wife to her husband. In a time when many other authors reveal in excrutiating detail what should be private, this is almost to be appreciated. However, with ""memoir"" in the title I expected more. I bought this book to find out how she really felt. We were told, for example, that the children presented a list of complaints to their parents. We do not know what a single one of those complaints were, nor how the parents responded. I have read the memoir of a very private person who wishes to remain so.Many reviewers have commented on the perspective Noor takes on Israel. Queen Noor is not impartial, nor should she be expected to be. I would have been more impressed if she had acknowledged that somewhere in the book."
3,Leap of Faith--Queen Noor,"Interesting read. Well written. However, I would like to have read more on her personal life; children, home life, etc., than on political happenings. Too much focus on politics, for my liking."
1,Anti Semitic Crap,I think our country should be ashamed at the number of people buying this book. This book is pure anti-semitic garbage. People from the liberal NEw York times to contributors to fox news agree. This is an extremely warped version of history and those of you who enjoy reading such racist dribble should be ashamed of themselves.
1,Leap of Faith,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I always viewed King Hussein as a ray of hope for peace in the Middle East. I had thought that his widow would write a piece that would enhance his vision. I was disappointed that Her Majesty simply rehearsed the same old anti-Jewish, anti-Israel sentiment that have been expressed for generations. Queen Noor had an opportunity to make a difference. In the end, she simply revealed her prejudices. Tis a pity."
2,Queen Noor,"Read in May, 2012formatPaperback (edit)reviewThe memoir of Queen Noor of Jordan was a very slow read. It was fascinating to hear about her life and how she had met the King of Jordan. I just could not get into this book also of Middle Eastern history and conflicts that were going on at that period in time"
4,"Qeen Noor, Leap of Faith","My order was handled efficiently and I received the book in a few days. It was in excellent condition. I needed the book for a book club, found it interesting and informative. Our discussion was great - a lot of information to discuss."
2,a little biased?,"Being an American currently living in Israel, I was hoping this book would help to educate me a bit on the complex situation here in the middle east.Her husband, being such a friend/ peace-maker to Israel, I was surpised by the Queen's negative references and 'digs' about Jordan's neighbor.Israel seems to be the root of all evil.I found her writing inciteful in most instances, but biased and untrue in terms of her point of view on Israel."
1,Jordanian Diatribe,"I bought this book expecting a biography of a young, beautiful woman who had happened to marry into a royal family and the story thereof. Instead I found myself reading a diatribe against Israel, the United States and even Egypt for the accord that Anwar Sadat signed at Camp David. It's a good book if you're interested in a one sided view of Arab affairs versus the rest of the world, otherwise give it a miss."
5,"A Leap of Faith, Unexpected Life","As a reporter covering the Middle East peace process and a procession of heads of state in Washington during the turbulent years of this book, I want to attest that Noor's (Hussein's) perspective on the roots of the conflict are accurate, insightful and need to be listened to.Her experiences with the American press unfortunately are all too typical of American news reporting that puts its own interpretation on interviews and chance encounters without addressing the substance of situations. In years to come, historians will look at the political accounts in this book and place it on the shelf with the best historical writing of this era."
4,Informative and Touching,"I wasn't sure, at first, that I was going to enjoy this book. But I became very interested in the story's progress because the author made me care for her family and her point of view. There was just enough history, personal perspective, and likeability of the characters that I wanted to see how they weathered the treacherous affairs of world politics. It was an eye-opening experience for me, and I support her efforts to improve the west's perception of Arabs and its understanding of Middle East affairs. I found it to be worth reading."
3,Carefully guarded autobiography.....,"Queen Noor manages to convey her love for Jordan and its king in very guarded, very carefully worded terms. My overwhelming impression is that though she might have much to say, her caution in expressing herself (after all, she continues to live there) made me think that she chose every word and thought with the idea of not making any Jordanian or Middle Eastern waves. It struck me that it would be a far more interesting read if she could have been more free in expressing herself - surely this is not free thought, freely expressed."
4,Excellent and Inspiring ...,"I've always been facinated with Queen Noor and literally had the bookstore pull this book out of the box in the back room the day it dropped. I was not disappointed. The Queen's style of writing is subtle and elegant and she explains middle east history and politics with a simplicity I've yet to find elsewhere. Her pro-Palestinian views are unwavering and presented with passion and respect. Her adoration of the Late King Hussein is relentless and exceptional.The catty side of me would have liked to have read a bit more on the challenges she faced as an non-Muslim American marrying the King of Jordan and becoming Queen. And I was also a little dissapointed to have her story basically end with King Hussein's death. She continues to lead a fruitful and productive life and I would have liked to learn more about what she has been doing over the last 3 years.Regardless, this is an excellent, fast read about an extremely interesting and inspiring life."
3,OK if you ignore the politics,"It's a good book about her life, but it gets into indepth details about the politics and the religion of that area of the world. It can get very tedious, and I basically just skimmed most of the book. If you understand politics and all the goings-on of that area of the world, then this book is for you. It's sort of the other side of history as we in the U.S. know it, and it's very biased against the US and Israel. The pictures are great though, and I did cry at the end when the King died."
2,Queen Noor:- a latter member of the beat generation,"From the book, it is obvious that Queen Noor is a latter member of the beat generation. For instance, there was the part about how she temporarily dropped out Princeton on account of her disdain for anything to do with the establishment as a result of the war in Vietnam. It seems to me that her main reason for converting to Islam was to rebel against Western values:- a slight variation of how hippies travelled to India in the 60s in search of spiritual enlightenment.I view with similar disdain her hypocrisy about Israel. She is constantly claiming to have an affection for the people of Israel, but uses a number of pages criticising the very existence of the country. I accept that not all people like Israel, but I feel that she should stop pretending to like it.I have no time for hippies like Queen Noor."
3,should have left well enough alone,"If Queen Noor had just written a book about her romance with the King of Jordan and their marriage this would've been a perfectly fine book but she had to get political and that ruins it. Noor's son is in line for the throne and one can assume that she wants him to get it so she tows the Middle East line. One would be tempted to believe the things she says about Jordan if it weren't for books like Lost Honor which tells about a recent so called ""honor killing."" There are a lot of unpleasant things about Jordan and the other Middle East countries that have nothing to do with Israel but you won't find any mention of them in the book. It's a completely sugar coated with whipped cream version of events."
2,Mediocre,"I had 10 long hours on the plane and couldn't finish this book. I understand it is written from the Queen's point of view so she can't avoid being unbiased, but the world just isn't black and white! The author's world definitely is, particularly when it comes to the King. Her husband seems almost a saint, who tries to keep his neighbors happy. The heads of other governments are not good people. They want to take advantage of the king's kindness. He suffers, but continues to believe in being honest, true and virtuous. His enemies continue to do him wrong.Maybe so. That's the way a loving wife would talk about her husband. But that's not what I was expecting to get out of it. If you want to read about a good man who was taken advantage of left and right, this is the book for you. If you want to read about a real man who tried to do good and made a lot of mistakes , whether intentionally or not, look elsewhere."
1,I was so hoping for something better....,"Unfortunately the autobiography is boring and somewhat distant and impersonal. Actually, overall the writing is uninspired and quite frankly, flat. Queen Noor, obviously a beautiful, intelligent, well-educated woman uses the book as a platform for spouting some pretty blatant untruths about the modern history of the Middle East. I guess I should have expected that, but it was disappointing nonetheless. I might have gritted my teeth and gotten past her politics if the love story was interesting. But it wasn't simply because the writing was so unemotional and disconnected. As I read the book, it was as if I could hear someone speaking in a monotone voice and it was almost sleep-inducing."
4,The MID-EAST from an American Woman's Perspective,"This book provides a unique perspective--an American wealthy woman who marries into Jordanian Royalty.The author discusses her care-free yout whith an emphasis on higher learning and attention to higher education.I was impressed with her acknowledgement of her own difficulties of bringing in a strong free American will into an Arab lifestyle that could dictate that she be more submissive and 'back-seat' than she was used to.Politically speaking, I liked that she spoke her mind and raised awareness to the stereotyping of her new people by the American media and her dismay and courage to try and rectify that.While sometimes, I felt as thought she wrote with a certain naiveness regarding world events that felt like she was a housewife expressing her opinion, I for the most part, enjoyed this book even when I disagreed with her."
1,Another third world ruler's wife profiting from the misery of her people,"I am sick and tired of one more method for the extremely corrupt Jordanian ""Royal"" family to benefit. They live a lavish life of luxury (both the old King and the current monarch) while the majority of the country lives in poverty. The Jordanian Royal family is one of the few Arabic and Muslim countries that play this public relation game to a point that makes some of us westerners truly believe that it is a democratic and peaceful country. A small percentage of Jordanians live in the wealthy suburb of west Amman (the capital). The rest of the Capital and the rest of the country is shanty towns and live below world standard's for poverty. She is nothing but a pretty girl who attracted a frivolous and womanizing king. The king died. A younger and more beautiful queen is married to the current frivolous king. Get over it. She gave nothing to Jordan and only took, her greed has no end."
1,Disappointing,"Far from the insightful candor I expected, this book was a disappointing concoction of political propoganda and classy personal endorsement. Queen Noor conveniently glosses over the monarch's questionable decisions in an effort to promote the central and underlying theme of this superficial memoire: we never make mistakes."
5,Very Nice Book shows how friendly the Arabs/Muslims are!,"Her book deserves FULL support; it shows how warm the Arabic/Muslim culture is. It describes how there are differences in the cultures between the West and East. But I think the book should also discuss the reasons why Arab women are treated a certain way among arab communities especially in the Gulf countries. I think this describes cultural differences better.Her Majesty is a symbol of globalization and human rights for women. She made it also clear at C-Span how Al-shorah in Islam is a wonderful modernalization tool. I think with the help of this tool women could be freed in the arabic world.But no Arabic country seems to have used this wonderful tool to its full potential to help free arabic women.So please read her book, to help liberate women, and let us stay one."
1,Ok if you don't mind all the hatred and anti-semitism,"Unreal that this woman can be such an unabashed anti-semite. Her revisionist history ignores every arab atrocity against Israel and the U.S. What a joke! Her husband, a paid CIA operative according to Jimmy Carter, comes off as a prince among men despite his hand in terrorism. All she does is complain about how unfairly the palestinians were treated despite the fact that her gloriously tiny husband waged a war against them and kicked them out of his country."
3,A little too much like a fairy tale,"An interesting book, no doubt about it ... however, the looong ""self-serving"" historical sections were more info than was needed in this book ... Also a few too many ""flowery"" descriptions which did not get down to the ""nitty gritty"". It appears that Queen Noor (an American by birth) accepted the Mid-East line hook, line and sinker. After a short storybook courtship, she married the much older King when she was in her 20's. Eventually she became assimilated into the Jordanian life and Arab world. An underlying theme in the book seemed to indicate that she was sad that her early life choices left her imprisoned there, so to speak. All in all, an interesting view of the Mid-East..."
4,Leap of Faith: Memoirs of an Unexpected Life-Queen Noor,I ordered this book along with the Hollywood 24-Hr. Miracle Diet. The book was originally packed in the same box with the 3 bottles of the liquid diet. One of the 3 bottles of the Hollywood Diet broke open and leaked all over the box and ruined the book. I returned the book with the one open bottle of the diet along with the two unopened bottles of the diet.In the future I suggest your employees pack liquid items securely and separately from other items so they do not move all over the box and break open ruining the other items that are shipped along with the liquid items.I requested a replacement copy of the book which I received.
5,"Truly, A Leap of Faith","When one reads ""Leap of Faith,"" what strikes you is the amazing faith and grace with which Queen Noor has conducted her life. There is no question that this is a remarkable book, a peek into what it is like to live in the inner circles of a kingdom which has been at the center of so much of the breaking news over the past decades. This book is a contrast to another set in the middle east, ""Daughter of Jerusalem"" by Sharon Geyer who dreamed of being a Persian princess only to find her world rocked by an abusive husband who banished her from their home after she gave birth to two sons. The two books taken together show how leaps of faith effect lives in different ways. One becomes a queen while the other spends twenty years trying to get her sons back. Both are incredible books."
5,Very Interesting,"In the begining I thought the book was a little slow, but it picked up and soon I could not put it down. I have a great interest in middle eastern history and current affairs so to me the book was very informative and educational. I also liked the easy yet intelligent way that Queen Noor expressed herself. I think this book is best suited for someone who is interested in learning more about middle eastern politics and or culture and also for people that would like to read about a woman who is strong and successful.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest for learning about Middle Eastern society in general."
1,Leap of Faith,"Where was the editor when this book passed through the publisher? While the author is obviously intelligent, her writing style is stilted, self-congratulatory, and non-introspective. She tries to be everything to every reader from a free spirit during her 1970's college days to the dutiful wife of an Arab monarch. She revealed very little about herself or her husband of any interest and expounded what could only be considered the Arab/Muslim party line. Yuck! I usually like to keep my books, treasured in my many bookcases but this one is going directly to the yard sale pile."
2,Noor falls short,"I was extremely disappointed by this book. Noor's writing is difficult to follow as she skips from subject to subject. The chronology of events is scattered. I was also bogged down by the insistent references to all the ""do-gooding"" she felt compelled to tell her readers about such as, ""I started this committee in Jordan and worked with this international organization, in addition I did such and such""...it was tedious to follow.I was also dismayed at Noor's evasiveness when she tackled tougher subjects such as King Hussein's prior wives. Also dismaying was her account of her first pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. When she miscarries she decides to ""not trouble the King while he is in the midst of business."" When Hussein does see her a bit later Hussein's way of dealing with her miscarriage is to take her skiing in the Alps and never once approaches the subject with her.A disappointing account of a woman who used to intrigue me."
3,SLANTED BUT WELL WORTH READING,"I found the book interesting, but readers should beware that it is HIGHLY political. If they are looking for a light read, this isn't the biography to choose.The Queen does toot her own horn quite a bit, and I don't think once in the book does she ever admit to either her or her husband making a mistake.As an American woman with many Jewish friends, I had always heard the Israeli side of the conflict. It was interesting to hear the Jordanian side. Now I would like to hear a slightly more balanced voice. (Can anyone recommend a book that takes the middle ground on the recent history of this war-torn region?)"
1,"A disappointing ""autobiography""","A tedious, superficial and dishonest book about a beautiful and supposedly highly educated woman. Her relationship with King H. is all cream and roses. There is no depth or openess in the recounting of her marriage. And the book is laced with a generous portion of one-sided history - this has nothing to do with the trials and tribulations of a Christian woman changing her religion to her husband's and sharing her life with a man whose religious and cultural background is vastly different than her own. If I am interested in Arab history I would have chosen to read a book solely dedicated to this subject. After reading ""Honor Lost - Love and Death in Modern-Day Jordan"" I get the impression that royalty is far-removed from daily life just down the street. Compared to most women around her, Queen Noor seems to be inhabiting an ivory tower. A disappointing read - there are more honest books out there."
3,History Lesson,I found this to be an interesting history lesson from a very different perspective. I learned quite a lot about the history of the conflict in the Middle East. It isn't a fast read because you have to digest it as you go.
4,Not really an autobiography but a good historical account,"I agree with some other reviewer who said this book doesn't offer as much insight into who Queen Noor is, but rather a solid and detailed account of the Middle East conflict. She writes with honesty and conviction about Jordan and its neighbors, and in the process may have offended some Americans. However, I think she's telling the truth and sure, some feathers are ruffled in the process. Anyway, I liked the book, but I was disappointed on how she basically sugarcoated the personal elements of her life, i.e. her troubled relationship with her stepchildren only covered 3 pages of a book that contained well over 400 pages! As much as she resented people portraying her marriage as ""storybook"", she's guilty of doing the same. She was guarded, and I had hoped she wouldn't be in her own memoir."
3,"Your Majesty, all is forgiven.","Queen Noor is more than forgiven for not writing a better book. She is royalty after all, and that better book would have required her to say a few controversial things about her adopted country, or to provide a few intimate details of her marriage to the late King. Her up-close-and-personal vantage point on recent world events is fascinating nonetheless, and her love story is entirely convincing and ultimately moving. And how would I have known that royals sometimes respond to job stress by calling for carry-out and playing video games?"
3,Solid debut,"I hadn't heard this record since about '96 other than the 2 Revelation Records singles that I still occasionally spin, but the upcoming Gorilla Biscuits reunion made me pull this one out again. I'm suprised at how fresh this sounds still, and is almost like what GB would have sounded like had they made a second LP. This record was completely written by Walter Schriefels (GB, Youth of Today, Quicksand etc) and the band was his concept, although he's not credited and was not an ""official"" member. So, this is basically a Walter record, and a good one at that. It seems like yesterday that I was singing along to these guys at Warped tour '95! 3.5 stars"
1,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS SELL OUT jeff from NY,Civ is great music from the old days with gorila biscouts but they sold out with there new 13 day getaway cd. It sucks its sounds like 3rd eye blind stuff. Its not hardcore at all it stupiod dont get me wrong but set your goals is a great cd dont buy 13dat getaway. civ sold out but there old stuff is good
1,1 star only because zero or negative stars were not an option.,"STAY AWAY!!! It is worth less than the 9 bucks I paid for it. Complete waste of money. Sometimes you take a risk and buy the ""cheap"" one and sometimes it works out great. NOT THIS TIME!!! Don't bother, just get the next one up in price. What an absolute piece of junk!!!!Batteries arrived corroded and unable to take a charge from their own charger or from another we have in the house.Charger wouldn't work on the batteries that came with it, nor would it work on other rechargeable batteries we had in the house. Every connection was loose and wobbly, every part of the product flimsy."
5,Very useful,"I bought this for my daughter's camera. She took a trip to New York, DC, Chicago, and Philly with her school. I did not want her to run out of batteries when taking a once in a life time trip or hassle with difficulty in charging them. It worked out amazing for her and luckily (I ordered item late) it arrived the day before she had to leave and with it charging 4 batteries at a time she always had charge batteries with two in use and two for back up and then could charge more when any ran out. It was great thanks very much she had an amazing trip with hundreds of pictures, not a memory was lost. Heidi Martin"
1,Fail to charge to specified capacity,"I have about 12 of these batteries, both 2200 and 2700 mAH types. They seemed to work well initially but then quickly began to fail. Two issues cropped up. First, all of the batteries fail to charge (or discharge) anywhere near the rated mAH. I can't get more then 1000 mAH out of any of them any more, even after massaging them with a fancy charger, and they are still virtually brand new (maybe 15 charge cycles on them max). The second issue is that about half of them start reading 0V after sitting on the shelf for a weeek and it takes applying a voltage for a short while to get the battery to read > 1.2V again. Clearly there is something seriously wrong with CTA's manufacturing process. Do not get these batteries.-Matt"
2,Worked for awhile,"Had this charger for about 6 months now. The batteries seem to last about as long as any other set of name brand batteries I have. The charger just blew up about 30 seconds ago though. Actually, it was the transformer in the plug.I think I'll pay for the name brand next time."
2,Concerns about Amazon as a seller???????????????????,"Why is it, that all the independent sellers have an option to ""Contact Seller"" and Amazon does not? I really think we should all try to buy from the independents and not from Amazon for none other than that reason.I purchased a set of CTA rechargeable AA batteries and a several of them won't take a charge, or won't hold a charge. I have dozens of AA rechargeables and many charger units and I would just like some SERVICE FROM AMAZON to send me some replacements.Your move Amazon????"
2,Ok charger for AA,"This does a good job charging AA's, but with AAA's, it just shows a green LED, indicating fully charged, but never charges the batteries. (Batteries were even their own brand.) Multiple contacts to CTA resulted only in autoresponses, never any useful information."
3,Steel's Obsession for Historical Details Makes This One Worth Reading,"I read this book for the first time the day it went on sale back in 1987, and while I found it mildly disappointing, Steel's obsession with the details, a fictional story weaved with true details of historical events (the murder of the Russian Tsar's family, the revolution that followed) kept me reading until the very last page."
3,ZOYA is not one of Danielle Steel's best,"It took me so long to read this book, the beginning was so slow to get going and the book didn't really get going until halfway through. I have read many Danielle Steel books and this is by far my least favorite. It took me at least 3 weeks to read it, and not because I had anything better to do, it just didn't hold my interest like her other works."
1,Worst book she's written,"I've read every one of Steel's books and loved them, but couldn't manage to get through this one. I admit I stopped reading somewhere beyond the half-way point. I've picked it up three or four times in the past five years but haven't made it to the end yet. I can't think of one other romance novel I've ever put down to never pick up again."
5,You Are My Best Female Writer!,"Your books made me decide that when I am in my middle ages after retiring from neuro-surgery I will start writing romantic novels like you.Peopl say I have talent so I guess I'll try.I like your style.Your books are very realistic and down-to -earth.I have a lot of your books but I wish I could read every one of them.By the way,has anyone ever told you that you are very pretty."
1,Not for most techno listeners...,"I can understand how some people might like this release but most people won't. Given how busy the world is today, Plastikman's work is almost always droney and boring -- give it a listen if you have the precious time to waste, but if you don't, buyer beware and stay away!!!"
5,Excellent. A master at the height of his powers.,"Aside from the length, this album is excellent. The sound is similar to his earlier work, yet more intelligent. The fact is I think Ritche is simply becoming a better musician. You can hear some of his earlier ideas, but they are expressed with much more finesse. While the albums are very different, I can hear some of Consumed in the sound. Track 5 is a MASTERPIECE. I remeber Richies days at the Shelter in Detroit. It is wonderful to hear him getting even better with age. So many artists simple cannot break out of set patterns. Rithie continues to evolve. Oh Yeah...did I mention that he is a genius?"
4,good overview of Desmond's career,"this CD showcases songs from all phases in the career of Desmond Dekker, from his first hits in the early 60's up into the 80's, a nice overview. Some of the recordings are not so great, but the music shines through anyway."
4,Ginkogin was an easy vitamin to swallow and ...,"Ginkogin was an easy vitamin to swallow and didn't have an unpleasant taste. I could taste a hint of garlic, but it was minor compared to other garlic tablets I've tried. I liked the press-out tabs instead of a bottle. It was easier to handle and there were no spills when trying to get a tablet out."
4,I felt that this product was beneficial. As ...,"I felt that this product was beneficial. As far as the Ginkgo Biloba helping my memory, I don't usually have a problem with that. But I did feel as if I had a bit more energy than normal, due to the ginseng. I think it's nice to be able to benefit from garlic in a convenient pill. The only thing I didn't like was the strong taste and odor of garlic while swallowing the pill, though I didn't detect a garlic smell on my breath after that. Overall, the Ginkogin is a pretty good product for health and well being."
3,"I've heard a lot about Gingko Biloba, and ...","I've heard a lot about Gingko Biloba, and I was glad that I got chosen to Test Drive this product. But to my disappointment, I didn't feel any big difference after using it for about two weeks."
2,I used this product for about 10 days ...,I used this product for about 10 days and it didn't seem to have any effect on me.
4,"Thanks, Mel Matthews","This is a story of a man who is not afraid to be who he really is. Its authenticity and vulnerability made me laugh, cry and wonder if I also have the courage to live and authentically be who I really am. A good read that is painfully sweet,honest and hopeful. Thanks, Mel Matthews. I look forward to hearing more from you."
3,Fun low budget action,"Jack Manning (Steve Railsback) is an ambitious cop. So ambitious, in fact, that he is framed by a corrupt superior officer (Michael Champion) and thrown off the police force. Eight years later, he's an alcoholic private detective. He is contacted by his old friend Mo (Dan Tullis Jr) who needs help cleaning up his neighborhood, which is plagued by street gangs, on orders from a corrupt businessman (Stuart Whitman) who wants the neighborhood in order to demolish and rebuild it.""Private Wars"" is a low budget direct-to-video movie. It looks cheap and has the type of soundtrack that only low budget movies have. But all of this is redeemed by the kind of over-the-top fighting scenes and action you don't find in most big movies as well as good performances by Steve Railsback and Stuart Whitman. Recommended for fans of brainless action movies who don't mind the low budget feeling. Those looking for a similar plot but a bigger budget, try ""Death Wish 3""."
5,Now where did I put down that Spliff??,"If you want mellow Dub then Buy 'Dub Chill Out-18 Massive Cuts'(they're all called 'chillout' because the producers were too stoned to think of anything else to call them).SO you'll have to look at the cover.....it's the one with all the little Rasta/Jamaican pictures on the cover. it's great, but you'll need a spliff and a hammock."
3,Lovely meditations but annoying music,"I really like Louise Hay and think these meditations are great. But there are two things that make it difficult for me to listen to this on a regular basis.First, the electronic music is very difficult to listen to and ignore so it's hard to get past that. I wish Louise would re-record this with more pleasant, non-electronic music.Second, there are several five-minute meditations; but the CD is only broken down into two tracks so it's difficult to just listen to a few of my favorite meditations. It would have been so much nicer to have each meditation be a track of its own."
2,I adore Louise Hay ~ but,"The background music is anything but background; it's most annoying! Louise Hay is always awesome; love her other CD's but I'm sorry I bought this one. The music dominates the CD and you really have to listen closely to hear what Louise is saying over the music. Other than the annoying loud music, the CD would be great!"
3,Good,Very fast moving. Yuma's character one of mystery and humor for a bounty hunter. Man of action than words. I liked the gunplay and the idea of a motorcycle that shoots on command.Good fight scenes.Good all around movie.
4,Good fit,"This install kit works great - good fit, well made, and the wiring harness connector made installing an aftermarket stereo in place of the factory stereo go quickly and easily"
3,Install Kit Incomplete,In order to do the complete installation additional wiring had to be purchased. It did fit fine and do the job but was just incomplete.
3,Farr is a delightful writer...,"Ms. Farr is a wonderful writer and this was a good book. Having said that, I didn't quite enjoy this book as much as DUEL OF HEARTS. Once I finished DUEL, I quickly found THE FORTUNE HUNTER and although the writing was great, the characters likable, etc. there just seemed to be something missing from this one. I can't quite put my finger on what is missing, but I still look forward to tracking down all of Ms. Farr's books and putting her books on ""auto buy."""
2,Boring,"I really did not enjoy this book in spite of all the wonderful reviews I had heard. The characters were boring and not believable and the plot was just slow and boring. I just did not care if Rival would be able to overcome Olivia's resistance to marriage or about all the little tasks she made him complete to remain in her company. It was just so mundane, with little tiny instances and bland conversation taking up so much of the book it took me forever to finish it!A disappointment."
2,Read the Expiration Date,"This might be a good sealant if you use it before its time-stamp. I would say its shelf life sucks; when I tried to use it several months after I bought it, it had coagulated into a lumpy, useless mess. Silicone sealants I've used in the past had shelf lives of at least a year--I'm still using a tube of Permatex Ultra Blue automotive sealant after more than 5 years! Of course you have to remove a hardened plug with an exacto knife each time."
5,"Magical, Fun filled, humorous, and very romantic!!!!","This movie should be watched for many reasons. You can see a little bit of every genre, thats why this movie is so unique. You can see many marvelous magic tricks and escapes performed, thats why its magical. You can see the love shared between Harry and Bess, thats why its so romantic. You can see much more, thats why you need to get it!!!!"
3,"One of my favorites, but.......","I remember this great movie from my childhood. Seeing it in Black & White on TV around 1964 or so. I loved it.Seeing it on DVD is a bit of a disappointment because the 3 Strip Technicolor has not been restored. Like all of these old Technicolor treasures they have various problems all having to do with the registration problems of the 3 strips. At various times Tony Curtis has green lines under his eyes, back gounds become blurry.It looks like films like Gone with the Wind and Wizard of OZ did before they had there restorations. Somehow they need to figure out a way make it affordable to bring a classic like this back to the kind of spendor that it deserves."
5,Houdini from My childhood,"Many years ago I remember this movie with Tony Curtis.... I remember seeing him in other movies and this one of those movies that made him so famous... A good addition to my classic movie collection... My little boy was studying the real Houdini and this is dramatized, but it is tells a good story...."
3,"Fine family entertainment, if a bit cute","Definitely a 1950's movie: accessible entertainment and a G rating are more important than historical accuracy or character development. Many of Houdini's finest tricks are not shown, and we never get more than a millimeter below the surface of this gifted althlete and showman. But the escapes are impressive, Houdini's struggles as a beginner are good, and the movie concludes with his increasing interest in death and seances. Tony Curtis is well-cast, but Janet Leigh is definitely too blond for the role of his wife Bess."
5,Oh man this is good music.,You know you can here a song and a few times and then start to like it. Well these guys change that the first time I heard them (from an old record I found at St. Vincent De Paul I knew I loved them They seriosly are the best band I have heard in a long time. Thanks Toots you rock!
5,I hope this is just the first of many more by M. McPhee,"My very favorite author happens to be Ms. McPhee'sfather, John McPhee, so with some trepidationI started this novel,fairly certain that I mightbe disappointed. Surely she couldn't be anywherenear his genius. I was wrong. I couldn't put thebook down, yet I didn't want it to end. She givesus characters we truly care about. Not just thethree sisters, but the very extended family thatcould only exist by gathering up hitch-hikers andcounter-culture dropouts. I felt I had known thesepeople, really had known them, after reading thisbook. I'm glad I did."
3,Engaging but unfinished tale of dysfunctional family in 1970,"This was an engaging book that I couldn't put down but ultimately it left me unsatisfied. I think Ms. McPhee does a wonderful job of illustrating a time and a place. The behavior of the grownups by our 90s standards is appalling (although they'd be on daytime talk for sure) but I know that in the '60s some people thought love and talk would solve all problems. There aren't many likable characters in the book, and I really kept expecting worse things to happen. But at the heart of this dysfunction, there's still a family trying to form. Children who want to be loved and cared for. A man who is building a tribe if not a family.However, the ending is not an ending. I don't expect all stories to be wrapped up in a pretty box at the end, but there was no closure to this journey. Perhaps it's because it was so well-written and compelling that it left me wanting more."
1,What a let-down,"From the reviews I expected a great first book, but I was so disappointed. I hung in there hoping something relevant would happen. No such luck. I learned in beginning creative writing not to end a book in this manner. The author seems to say that by ignoring children they can find their true selves. That is, they can smoke and take dope, drink, have sexual encounters, steal, whatever. I can't stand a thing about this book."
4,"My Opinion - ""Beginning Programming""","I think this would make a good text for a beginning programming class. The authors touch on various programming languages, though I would prefer to see sample code in all languages (or at least have it available online) so an instructor could choose which to use."
5,Great for my niece!,My 4th grade niece was having a bit of trouble with math (once called arithmetic) and this book really did help her catch on.
4,Truly scary and suspenseful,"This was the first book that I read by John Saul. This book was hard to put down. The characters were captivating. I also liked the folklore of the water babies and how it was tied into the story. From the fist chapter on you are hooked into this story. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the loose ends. For example, who took care of Christy after Miss Diana and why did the wind effect people. Also, why did Esperanza do what she did at the end. This is a must read and I look forward to my next book by John Saul."
2,Like getting to second base...,"With the easiest girl in school and then she asks to be taken home. You think you're going to score, but Miss Easy has turned into Miss Prude. Argh!Saul had an awesome premise in this book, and he came close to true fear a couple times, yet in the end he flirted with the trigger but never pulled it. Why, John Saul, why? The result is an unsatisfying, boring letdown of a book. I thought he was supposed to be in league with King and Koontz, but if this book is any indication, Saul owns the bush league. The murders are watered-down and PG. The significance of the wind is never explained. So many near scares that after a while you're convinced you will never darken the corner of third base, let alone home plate. Add to that the stiff characters and bad dialogue coupled with the withering suspense and you realize this is one date in need of a merciful abbreviation. Stay away."
1,boring,"man this was a boring book. This was like the 3rd saul book i read, and I thought all of his books were great. I geuss i am alone here. This one was slow... dragged on forever about a basment door creeking. I dont get it. What was so scary about a bsement door creeking and a baby crying? i had a hard time staying awake while reading this book. i guess most of the people who wrote great reviews about it read it in the 60s before horror was really greusome and detailed. this book did nothing for me. id rather watch a black and white flick with bad actors and bad special effects."
2,Terrible,"The story was awful. Just awful. Underdeveloped characters, boring storyline and just cheesy enough to make me cringe. I got this book on CD for a 15 hour drive and was sorely disappointed about 1/2 hour in. This isn't horror writing at its finest, that's for sure."
5,Corey Smith Does another GREAT job,"Corey Smith is obviously one of the best singer/songwriters to come out of the South along with many others. The difference with this CD and other CD's of Corey, is that he is telling it like it is with words that we all can relate to, feelings and emotions about everday life and a voice as smooth as sweet tea and pecan pie. I did pick up additional tunes from a live compliation Corey has going on iTunes. Like everything Corey does, it is all about real life including a great song about the Po Po. I personally have all of Corey Smith's CD's, but this one sticks out as he is always hitting home with undertones. If they had more than 5 stars, he would get it. I would love to see him in concert, listen to this CD and you will understand why."
2,Delorme Has Gone Downhill,"I recently went to buy several new Delorme Atlases (for a few different states) because my old ones are getting a bit long in the tooth. Well, I left the store without them. I'm glad I didn't order them here because they would have been sent right back. The newest versions are simply zoomed-in highway/road maps. I can get the same info at the gas station for a dollar and have 70 less pages of nothing to carry around. There are no elevation contours, half the details are gone, and the format is generally 'dumbed down.' These maps used to show all sorts of interesting things for those who ventured off the main roads. The new ones show major roads, pretty colors, and generally which Interstate takes you to the national forests. If you're cruising the Interstates and are looking for the triple latte of highway maps, you're set. Otherwise... worthless.Sorry, but Delorme REALLY blew it. They need to rehire the cartographers and fire the graphic artists."
2,The scale is too large to be useful,"The scale of this Utah DeLorme atlas is too large and the maps in it are unsuitable for detailed recreation planning (in my case mountain biking). The scale is 1:233,000! You have to squint to see certain important Forest Service roads at this scale, and fine details are imperceptible. DeLorme needs to lower the scale by a factor of at least three.These comments refer to the Sixth Edition (2008). DeLorme revises these maps periodically so if you're reading this review years later check to see if they've fixed the problem before deciding not to buy it.For now, the question is, Where can one buy a suitable atlas for offroad trip planning? Once I've figured out where to go I can buy an excellent National Geographic Trails Illustrated or Latitude 40 map. But I need an atlas for identifying promising areas. And this one won't do the job."
2,A Bunch of Loops,"Well, we have 3 mixes of ""Streamlined"" by Sunshine, and two new jammies from ATDI. This is my first introduction to Sunshine, and the song on this disc is really nothing more than one drum beat with various guitar effects over it (and vocals). Nothing too exciting -- nor are the two remixes. As far as At the Drive-In is concerned, ""Extracirricular"" seems to be your standard ol' run of mill ATDI song...not earthshattering by any means (hey, I didn't really like ""Catacombs"" either, although that is different). But ""Autorelocator"" deviates into an electronic world that ATDI have never to this point explored so deeply. Its a very interesting song, once again built around one drum loop, but it seems to have a lot more lasting value to it than ""Streamlined."" Overall, its a fair listen, but these three songs (and 2 remixes) are definately not worth ten bucks."
5,Awesome set,"This is a very, very high quality flatware set. The pieces are sturdy, strong and stylish. You cannot go wrong. This is comparable to what you might find in upscale restaurants."
4,excellent quality,"I've only had this flatware set a short time, but they seem wonderful so far, heavy duty and classy looking, they stand up to the toughest block of ice cream."
5,High quality at a rock-bottom price,"I purchased this flatware set as a gift and it far exceeded my expectations. For the price, the quality and heft of these pieces is unbelievable. I agree with another reviewer who said they were even better in person than they look in the picture. Perfect for a gift as they are attractively boxed and presented. If you need a sturdy, attractive set of flatware, buy this now!"
5,EXCELLENT FLATWARE!!!,This flatware is very shiny and of a good weight. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a nice set of flatware at a very reasonable price.
2,Save your money!,"This set of flatware is a great price and looks nice, too, but that's where the positive review ends. After only a couple washes in the dishwasher, various pieces began RUSTING! I have never had this problem with other flatware before. What a waste of money."
1,It's not worth the money,"Don't buy it, you will be disappointed. It's not worth the money. Look for something else."
5,Excellent product,"This is my first grown-up, non-discount store set of flatware and, wow, I can't believe how nice it is. The pieces feel substantial (the shipping box is really heavy) and look great. My mother, who wouldn't think of buying discount flatware as I did, picked up a piece and was convinced that I'd really dropped some serious cash on it. I was happy letting her think that!"
5,Nice looking set,The set arrived and i couldn't be happier with the quality. All edges are smooth and all pieces seem to be weight balanced nicely. I enjoy eating with this set.
4,Flashmaster owner made it right to: Didn't last long,"I AM IMPRESSED!Today, I received a new replacement Flashmaster in the mail. I did not expect it. It was shipped directly from the owner, Charles Recor.Talk about excellent customer service. This company has displayed the integrity of what an American business is all about.I am happy to start using the Flashmaster with my child again.Thank you Mr. Recor! Based on your response I can recommend parents to get a Flashmaster for their kids.Marlene BaronOriginal post:This item broke after 6 months. I really expected more longevity considering it's not exactly cheap.Think twice before getting it.We took care of it and didn't leave it laying around. My child used it for practice and then I put it away.You are better off accessing websites for free that assist with everything this Flashmaster can do.Save your money.Marlene Baron"
5,FlashMaster,"Very happy with this product, it's safe and very easy to use, I do recommend it. Kids will learn from it and at the same time will have fun with it."
3,It's not fun but it does the job.,"This isn't ""fun"". It's a way to practice math drills, and it does a good job of reinforcing math facts. Our kids do it but they don't have fun. Don't expect your children to think this is a game. Our kids would rather do math Wrap-Ups."
5,Flashmaster is great tool for all ages!,"The whole family is having fun exercising their brain and going to new levels with the Flashmaster. My 12, 9 and twin 6 year olds are using it every day to improve their math skills and get the basics down. It is a serious toy that challenges you and you don't have to worry about all the extras because there are none! Kids love to learn and you don't always have to get them something cute or pink or full of characters and such to have them get caught up in learning. Kids love to learn more than some adults so be confident when you choose this learning tool and treat it as a valuable tool and share it with your friends (not literally) so they will purchase their own. I have been asked to lend it out but I will not . . . we hate to be without it!Homeschooling in Emmet County, Michigan"
5,Flashmaster,"Gave this to my Grandaughter for Christmas. She loves it and uses it daily. Her Math Teacher suggested it.I loved the fast shipping of this item. Thank you to the Seller. Marianne Peabody,Ma."
4,Math facts,"This is great for drilling math facts. However, it is very expensive! The design seemed sort of counter-intuitive to us, but our children did figure it out right away despite their young ages.Two years later: we do use the FlashMaster, but we also bought a vintage ""Little Professor"" Radioshack toy from ebay. It also drills math facts, but was about $10, including shipping. Life is too short to stress out over expensive toys that the children don't even love."
2,"mediocre, opinionated, and somewhat boring","This is not a reference book nor a how to book. It describes web sites & how those sites tackled their display problems. If you have to buy 3 css books, I'd recommend this order:1. OReilly - CSS The Definitive Guide by Eric Meyer (great reference)2. Any good CSS cookbookAnd, if you really need a 3rd book after the 2 above... consider this book along with any of the several others out there.PS: I am not a fan of MS either, but if I'm paying good money for a book, I don't want to be continually reminded by the authors of how poor of a product ms puts out. The poor quality of MS Web technologies is well known."
2,Not Impressed!,"By the name ""Professional"" I expected a book that would pick where most ""Beginning"" CSS books left off. This book is mostly filled with case studies, that is it showing the code of several web sites, instead of being an instructional on how to take advantage of CSS's more advanced features. Its defiantly not what it was described as being."
1,Not for beginners,I expected transliteration (roman script) along with Hindi script. This dictionary has only Hindi script and is useless unless you know Hindi script. I returned it. . .
3,Outdated but at least somewhat useful,"This dictionary is fairly out of date and is missing several common words which should be there. However, I have been using it for over 3 years and have been able to find most of the entries I was looking for. It also contains lists of Hindi sayings and vocabulary grouped by category (such as colours, parts of the body, animals, etc.) which I found helpful. You probably won't find a better dictionary with both Hindi-English and English-Hindi listings."
4,Greatt,"Came in on time, supportive shoes, a little high, but exactly what the description says. Very sexy, and an attention grabber, looked great with my halloween costume. I would suggest buying from this seller."
3,Nothing great here,This is a very average girls gone wild dvd. A couple semi-hot girls flashing at the beach but nothing special at all. One thing I really disliked about this video is there's alot of girls making out with eachother. I'd rather see one girl pose at a time without any making out.
5,high voltage jazz infused dnb,"If you liked DJ Shadow's ""Entroducing"", think of this as a more upbeat/go-get-em version of that. In every way it is just as much if not more of a masterpiece than that album. From totally original and intricate beats, brilliant arrangements, long flowing songs -- everything about this cd is just perfect -- it's obvious a lot of time was spent on all these songs. As mentioned above, some of these songs are a few years old too, which implies these fellows have had a finger on the underground for awhile (not surprisingly, really). If you like Bukem or Shadow or the like, you MUST HAVE this cd (It's actually worth the import price, unless you can find it on vinyl somewhere)."
5,Wow!!,"It's been quite a while since I have listened to CCR and John Fogerty. Discovering this cd was like revisiting with an old friend that has been given a new lease on life. Even though it is a tribute album with various artists performing these songs, it is such a refreshing listen. The songs are wonderful, some familiar to me, and some not so familiar, and the artists and the arrangements are absolutely fabulous. I highly recommend this cd to any CCR or Fogerty fan. You will not be disappointed. Each and every song is excellently done. Bravo!!"
3,Gets medicore kicks.,"O.K. action, O.K entertainment. This T.J. Roberts flick has some good karate moves that you can admire for the whole hour-and-a-half."
3,eh... pretty bland,"Well, it was cheap. And, that's why I bought it. So, I guess I shouldn't complain. But, when I got it, I thought that it looked kinda cheap, and just kinda bland. It doesn't really look as fancy as I thought it would from the photos. Pretty average product. So, if average is what you want - go for it!"
3,Mixed Bag,"This cd is a collection, so it's not surprising that it IS such a mixed bag. There are a few too many cha cha chas for my taste, and I really dislike the disco/samba-type second cut (Ritmo Pilon). However, there is also some GREAT stuff from Grupo Sierra Maestra, Abelardo Barroso, and Celina Gonzalez. If you are a true Cuban music fan you should get the cd. The songs that I love on this cd I can't find anyplace else."
3,Incorrect Product Description,"Although the product description in the webpage states that the package contains 10 Test Strips and the Glucose Control Solution, the product arrived without the items. The box clearly indicates these items are not included in the package though. So the product desciption at amazon.com is wrong!What's Inside:Accu-Chek Advantage Blood Glucose Monitor (Batteries Included)10 Accu-Chek Comfort Curve Test Strips with Code KeyAdjustable Accu-Chek Softclix Lancet Device with 10 LancetsAccu-Chek Comfort Curve Glucose Control SolutionUser's manual and quick reference guide (English & Spanish)Carrying caseSelf-test diary"
5,Entry Level Savior,"As a mathophobe needing to take a stats class for psychology degree requirement, I found this book essential. Tried Statistics for Dummies and old textbooks, not finding what I needed. This purchase was crucial and beneficial to my learning. The information was easy to understand, not too basic and not too hig brow, difficult, and/or past my level. Highly recommend reviewing with this book and study pack before taking a statistics class for high school or entry level in college."
3,Bleddie Okay at Best,"I crave 'dried sausage' or droe wors as we call it in South Africa.I usually order from AfricanHut.com. It costs about $9 dollars more per 1/2lb, but is well worth it.I tried this company because of their affordable pricing.I got 3 bags and it was kinda okay tasting but was a little too thick, and dry as a bone.It needs more fat for flavor because it just tastes like vinegar! :(This sausage needs work.It is not ""Bleddie Lekker"" yet, but is close.Maybe ill try the biltong.WE NEED MORE ONLINE OPTIONS TO ORDER QUANTITY. IM HUNGRY!!"
4,Light cleanser,"I love Shiseido products. This is very light cleanser. You need to use very little, size of a pea, of this product. Nice cleanser"
3,Warning,"No problem with the quality or order delivery, but beware you will need to buy one for each caliper piston. For my SVT Mustang that means 2 per caliper, 4 total for the front brakes. I recommended to the supplier that the description be made clear about that, but I noticed it has not changed."
3,Transaction was quite satisfactory.,"The package arrived sooner than expected and was in good condition. Mr. Moon followed up on the shipment repeatedly, making sure I had received it and that I was pleased, which I was. My transaction with Mr. Moon was quite satisfactory."
4,worth it,"I believe this book really helped me for my board exam. This was the only book I used to review for the test, it has many review quizzes, a mock board at the end, and case study tests. I was happy with my score :)"
2,The Story of Pi,"I was disappointed. While skimming through the book prior to giving it to my 7 year old son, I stumbled on the Chapter on ""PI"". It was obviously wrong stating that the diameter of a circle would wrap around the circle ""3 and a little bit"". Now, how can I trust this book knowing that the editors missed such a glaring error? Could be very confusing to a young aspiring mathmetician."
4,A Great Book,I read this book and really loved it! It puts mathematical concepts into a very useable form. It is a great book to use with kids and start discussions regarding mathematics.
4,"Quiet, understated English mystery","Pale as the Dead by Fiona Mountain is the first book in the Natasha Blake series. Natasha is a professional genealogist who is contacted by a mysterious young women's boyfriend after the girl's disappearance. The only clue to her identity is an old diary that Natasha uses to find out who she really is and why she's gone. At first I was a bit put off by the distant writing style Mountain uses throughout the book, but as I continued reading, I could see that it is merely Natasha's way of looking at the world and that Mountain's writing is brilliant at portraying that. I was hoping for more in the way of actual family tree investigation, but I can see that Mountain is really setting up Natasha with a series of minor characters who will make appearances in future novels, and perhaps there will be a bit more depth to everyone in those. (The next book Bloodline is already at the top of my stack)."
2,Note impressed!,"Reads like a romance novel. Takes forever to get going, and really doesn't end up going any place. The heroine is too self-involved, - ringlets & damp-curls around her face not-with-standing. Not my cup of tea."
4,a real operatic bargain,"Gianni Schicchi and the Dark Knight are at first sight an unlikely couple but the booklet explains why they have been linked. Schicchi is now a very popular black comedy but the knight's tale is really grim. The music however is pure Rachmaninov and well worth repeat listening. Both operas are very well staged and the Opus Arte presentation is excellent apart from the cover art. One would hardly know the Miserly Knight was included! This is silly as what appears to be a one opera disc is so much more attractive when one discovers it combines the previous two DVD release in a superb blu ray disc. Get it! A wonderful Christmas disc to match the joy of Schicchi, with the Knight more in tune with current economic times!"
5,Beautiful!,"This puzzle is well manufactured and the picture is absolutely gorgeous! Considering the lack of a lot of colors, it's going to be a REAL challenge (that's a GOOD thing)!"
5,After a nice sit down...,"Loved this book. Nicey has a wonderful, witty tone and covers the essentials to British tea drinking and biscuit dunking. Wonderful review of the various biscuits with photos, good guide for those who are new to the art of biscuit buying. Wifey manages to keep everything on topic."
3,different but nice,"I was expecting the usual regency, and I had a pleasant surprise.First of all, the heroine was not a naive virgin (sick and tired of those) but an unmarried mother who had had to earn her keep.The hero was in incognito but did not decide to marry her no matter what: he recognized the problems that would arise and cosidered them carefully.What I liked best was the fact that the author touches, even though with a very light hand, the bias that the nobility had towards the 'commoners' and how hard it was, psicologically, for a noblewoman to marry someone who was not a peer.I gave it 3 stars because the last part of the book was, in my opinion, rather rushed and a bit too obvious. However I will definitely read other books by this author."
1,Frida Cries,"This is her worst recording ever. It doesn't do her limited voice justice! There is not one song on this album that is worth listening to. Also Frida's English is very bad; what one could describe as charming with ABBA, is irritating when this lady cries alone! No wonder she was ABBA's second fiddle!!"
1,Terrible CD,"What more can I say then: what a terrible album. Frida's voice is so bad, she cratches from one song to another.. She could and should have done much better. When this album flopped big time Frida herself explained that the sound of the album was ahead of it's time... Well it is two decades later now. More than ever it is clear that Frida was wrong. It is simple a worthless record."
5,Frida proves she's one of a kind!,"With this, her criminally panned and ignored, yet spirited and uplifting second English album, Frida proves to us that she is truly one of a kind. Thanks to producer Steve Lillywhite's knack for catchy hooks and melodies, Frida is represented by some of the best stars in the business in this extraordinary collection. It has an 80's Eurodance sound, which can't be beaten, even today, and it's really really great! Buy it before it's too late!Highlights: ""Shine,"" ""One Little Lie,"" ""Slowly,"" ""Heart of the Country,"" ""Chemistry Tonight."""
4,No surprises,"I am looking forward to moving on to the Dark Tower Comics dealing with material not covered in the 7 books. The illustrated aspect is neat but there is basically no new information except the little extras at the end of the issues, which by the way are not included in the hardcover version if anyone was leaning that way."
4,Artwork is freakin cool,"I love this series and hope they make a movie. Picture jim Carry playing his ""Clint Eastwood"" character from the movie "" Bruce Almighty""... that would be cool heh heh.... lol....The downside of this was how short it was.....I want more!!!"
5,"An old classic, still a hit today","I loved this book as a child and now my young children love it too. The illustrations are fantastic... the kind of illustrations that remained implanted in the back of my mind for 30 years: it was a joy to see them again and I was surprised at how clearly I had remembered them. Your kids are going to love this book.The story is simple. The Big Brown Bear is sent off to get supper and can not resist the honey bee hive his wife warned him against. Apparently this is a recurrent problem for Mr. Bear. The results are predictible and Mr. Bear returns home with supper (a large fish) and a very swollen (stung) nose. Mrs. Bear immediately realizes what has happend, applies a huge bandage and serves up the fish. None the less, Mr. Bear wishes he had some honey for dessert."
4,I liked it,"I knew very little about the PFC. This manual did an excellent job of explaining each service and its functions. This manual is much better than the PFC information that comes on the PB disks. This manual is not reference manual, it is a LEARNING GUIDE. I highly recommend this for someone not familiar with PB and wants to learn the PFC."
3,Bob Hendry -- Good....Publisher of this book -- Bad,"I've read through the glowing reviews of this book and have this mental picture of those same authors, lost on a desert island and praising the taste of seaweed because it was the only thing to eat. I too bought this book. Before I go on, let me say, that it is not the material presented that I am critical of, but the lack of any real editing or QA. Page 1 thru 236 are ""Section One: Overview"". This is the least of it's problems. The pages appear to be photo-copies, rather than printed material and more than a couple of critical objects necessary to complete the course were missing from the lab disk. Bob Hendry's very good effort has not been given a respectable treatment by the publisher."
5,Very good book for beginners/Intermediate PFC programmers,"This is a very good place to start on PFC. It goes thru all the main PFC classes and I learned a lot from this book. The lab exercises are great.The only drawback is that there are a large number of typos in the book and there should be a proper contents and index page.Also, it will be useful if the author supplies two versions of the lab exercises - one which is not solved and one which is solved. Right now, he gives only the solved version, so it makes you lazy to do the exercises when you have the solution.Over all, a must buy for any one wanting to learn PFC. Good job by the author."
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"I am a consultant who has been developing applications using PowerBuilder for the last 5 years who has never used the PFC; so, I thought this would be a quick way to learn it. However, the book has directions that don't make sense and the first time I did an exercise, it failed with a bad runtime reference. It might be a good companion book if you're actually taking the class; at least you can ask the instructor why things aren't working. But to buy the book as a vehicle to learn the PFC, it's useless."
1,I don't know what it is,This is parts of gospel music apparently practicing. I do not know why Elvis Presley's name is even on it.
4,Very Enjoyable Book,"I found this a very interesting read. There were great anecdotes, interesting insights and it's not too difficult to read if you aren't musical.The analysis of songs is also pretty fair. Yes, it talks up great songs, but it also notes that there were quite a number of banal ditties produced over the period."
1,Too detailed for me,Gave up after a chapter or two. Maybe a music major would benefit but it was snoresville. Dont be bothered.
4,A Realistic Fairy Tale,"This may not be Anne Tyler's best book but it still portrays life as it really is. It is not your typical American novel that the characters always end up living happily ever after. Of course, Ian Bedloe, the main charcter of the novel had a happy ending, but he has gone through many hard times that we are all in some ways familiar with. The novel doesn't only talk about the pains and hardships that the Bedloe had battled with but how they were bounded by their extraordianary love for each other. Saint Maybe is a pleasure to read. I only finished it in one sitting without experincing a single dull moment while devouring it"
5,A novel about being human,"This novel touched a chord that no other has for some time; yet it expresses something that is so familiar to each of us: namely, that there are events that find their way into each of our lives that have an irrevocable impact on the way we live -- or even are ABLE to live.Saint Maybe is filled with emotion and meaning from the first to the last page, and it isn't a chore to find what Tyler is driving at: separate from any mitigating factors such as race, class, or gender, there is a deep complexity to being human that we all share, and that through a variety of twists and turns in our lives we all suffer some damage as a result of events and how they are dealt with. Anne Tyler calls attention to (for lack of a better term) the ""human condition"" in a way that I found to be both lyrical and meaningful.This is a great novel!"
3,"Entertaining, but what a letdown","The premise was good. The first chapters were very scintillating, and Tyler did not go into excruciating descriptions of minutiae (I read Ladder of Years some time ago, and what a drag that was). The novel petered along fairly well, but the last couple of chapters read like any cheap romance novel found at a 7-11. The sappy ending ruined the book for me."
4,A Captivating Book,"Anne Tyler's ""St. Maybe"" is a captivating book. She writes in the omniscient point of view, giving the reader a good understanding of all of the characters, not just Ian (who could be considered the main character). Her use of this point of view keeps the reader involved in the book, always begging for the next piece of information, which Tyler almost always delivers quite smoothly. The story left some questions unanswered for me, but other readers may disagree, and say that the answers are given through the story's finish. Overall, this book is recommended and like other readers, I plan on reading other Anne Tyler books in the future."
4,Saint Maybe,"Compelling story that kept my interest. The author developed the characters well. Our book club read this book. Would have appreciated a study guide. Ian seemed to be paying a terrible price for his guilt, but in the end seemed to find a good life."
2,Story line never went anywhere,I had great hopes for this book but was sadly disappointed. The story line in this book went is so many different directions but would then drop the ball and I was left wondering what is going on here? I found this book to be very fragmented and incomplete.
3,Slow reading but good story,"I like the characters and the story, but the author takes too much time with details and the pace is slow."
5,Personal atonement,"Anne Tyler captures the essence of atonement as Ian Bedloe realizes his error for making a false accusation very early in his life. He spends the rest of his life atoning for this error. The fascination is that no one else seems to blame or even believe Ian is at fault. How often does this occur in our own lives when we take on the guilt of something we know we have done but others fail or refuse to recognize our fault. Ian Bedloe does the ""right"" thing and we are left wondering just why he makes this difficult sacrifice all in the name of reconcilliation. We only hope we would be as noble and charitable. Once again the novel informs us of who we are and how our culture treats us; we are not alone and we need such reminders of what life is all about. Anne Tyler kindly reminds us."
4,RL review Saint Maybe,A reading group at my church read and reviewed this book and found it to be very good and enlighten. I enjoyed the Saint Maybe very much.
3,Saint Almost,"The first book of Anne Tyler's I read was The Accidental Tourist, and I was really taken with that. The idiosyncratic characters and their unique world views made me laugh. So I think I got into this track where I considered Ms. Tyler to be ""good."" But after having read several of her books over the years, and having now just finished Saint Maybe, I wonder if I had on overly rosy view. Oh sure, she's won a Pulitzer Prize and all, but ...Let me think this through: I love her use of language to draw pictures of scenes, moods, or characters. She has an affectionate view of humanity that charms me. Here's what disappoints me - the way she lets her characters and their lives fade from vivid color to drabness.A quibble specific to Saint Maybe is that Danny's sudden suicide was never satisfactorily explained, and yet most of the story's premise hinged on that act."
1,Book for the Oprah set,"If you think that all that is needed to cure the world's problems is more hugs, Anne Tyler is your author. This book is chock full of two-dimensional characters, facile hope and forgiveness, and a second half that races ahead nearly thirty years while the first half concerned itself with only one year. For a more cogent representation of the world, read Don Delillo or Ann Beattie."
2,"DISAPPOINTING, DISAPPOINTING, DISAPPOINTING!","I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,"" ""Breathing Lessons"" and ""Back When We Were Grownups"". ""Saint Maybe"" was a huge disappointment. The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over. The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult. Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, ""Saint Maybe"" is still a mystery to me. One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being ""Saint Maybe,"" but who the heck is Saint Maybe?? The closest I could come up with is ""MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't!"""
4,Very Good. A Nice Story,"You can read the plot description for yourself. If you want serious yet entertaining fiction this is it. I've read many of Anne Tyler's novels and this isn't the best, but it is very very good. She's a wonderful writer. Don't miss out on this one."
3,A decent cd of most of her rockabilly sides...,"This is by no means a representitive cd of Clines' hits, or career, however it's a gem for those searching for earlier material more hillbilly boogie, western swing, and rockabilly oriented stuff. Here we have a full on rockabilly classic in the title song Stop Look & Listen. And some earlier and difinitive versions of her 60's hits. She also tributes Hank Willaims with Lovesick Blues, with a yodel too. The cd overall is very listenable, but also very short, and without recording dates, but a good way to acquire Stop Look & Listen, her rockabilly gem, cheaply.Bottom line... if you have al her hits and want to explore her earlier career, or just want to own her rockabilyl classic Stop look & Listen, go ahaed and buy it, it is enjiyable enough."
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled by the reviews here. They are actually reviews of the Princeton University edition, which is what most students of Blake will want to have. This book, printed by Kessinger Publishing, is simply a copy of the text that can be easily gotten from the internet and printed off on your home computer. There are no reproductions of Blake's images."
1,Not Recommended!!,We bought this toilet seat just a few months ago. Was garbage from day one. It is a great looking toilet seat. It goes awesome with our lodge themed house. But it doesn't stay in place no matter how many times you adjust it. I would not recommend wasting your money. Not a good buy at all.
3,Slim-fast bars,"This product is a decent addition to use in your diet. While the coating is slightly gritty in taste, the bar is chewy and good-tasting, as well as filling. A good choice."
2,Not well edited,"There is a lot of good information in this book, but the figures have missing data and the programming examples have missing commands. It looks like this book was thrown together from other texts and then not checked for consistency. In all, you probably won't pass the CCNA by using this book as a study guide."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"this book is an shortened offshoot of Todd's other book. It doesn't make you learn quicker either. Stay with the full version. And yes, alot of typos and errors................"
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD,"Being a fan in the 60's I bought this thinking it was the original hits in a greatest hits format. Instead it is a ""many years later"" re-recording. Bad to me is done using cheezy 80's style synth...sounds like Devo meets Billy J Kramer...totally messes up the song as with Little Children as well. I was very disappointed with this cd. I think when these 60's starts re-record theit music it should be clearer on the packaging."
1,"Terrible, Awful!","This is perhaps the worst effort at re-recording hits that an artist ever made. It is almost like Billy J. Krammer tried to make a dog. I thought I had found a treasure. Popped the CD into my car player, and it was all I could do to keep from firing it out the window on my way home. However, it did not make it past the kitchen trash. If you are looking for Billy J. Krammer's hits -- make sure the songs are by Billy J. Krammer with the Dakotas."
1,Wow - Most horrible re-recording I have ever heard.,"No wonder it is so cheap. Thank goodness I only wasted a few bucks. If you want to listen to the songs of Billy J. Kramer as you heard them on the radio when they came out, you will have to find another CD of the original recordings."
4,Up there- a beautiful bachata showcase,"Good compilations cds are still a rare find. Meaning a compilation cd that truly has a series of songs that can be enjoyed without skipping through it. This one is a gem and if you have been following bachata music over the past few years you will definitely be able to identify and relate to this beautiful line up of songs. It has some popular bachatas: Vivi, Chica de mi barrio & Quien eres tu and some artists that are new to the genre (i.e. Domenic M & Vanessa Gil). If you like diversity in bachata this is a cd that exemplifies the beauty and diversity that bachata has to offer. A strongly recommended purchase."
5,A fabulous novel and the best of Veryan's books.,"This last installment of Veryan's wonderful Golden Chronicles makes me scream with envy. This book was wonderful and her best yet.Funny and heartwarming, this book gave us more insight into Roly's character who developed in all 6 books of the Golden Chronicles"
2,Poor manufacturing,"The lamp is smaller than I expected ... largely because the shade is so small, with no dimensions for it listed on the product page. It is very small for a table lamp. Too small for an end table. More appropriate for a dresser or decorative lighting.The finish on the base is nice -- exactly what I was looking for. But the lamp base was poorly made. It tilts to one side, not a little but a lot! Immediately noticeable. It took me two seconds to decide to return it.At nearly forty bucks, the item is over-priced, imo. This is a thirty-dollar item tops, should be fifteen to twenty on sale.Too bad, too. I am looking for a set of table, torch, scounce, and chandlier lamps in oil-rubbed bronze. I initially was going to purchase a large number of these, but later decided to purchase only one. I am glad I chose one over the ten that were in my basket."
2,Look elsewhere,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews. Not only does she provide little actual instruction, she sits behind a desk so that you never see what she's doing when she does instruct! The constant chit-chat is annoying, too. This woman has a wealth of information to give an I wish she'd redo the video. Although it's pretty obscure, I was able to get the DVD through my library's statewide loan system; I suggest anyone try to rent before buying."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this video! I did not get anything out of it, especially what I wanted to learn."
3,Good as far as it goes,"The ""Railroads of Southern and Southwestern Wisconsin"" really only covers the Mineral Point & Northern Railroad, the Freeport, Dodgeville, & Northern, and the Chicago, Madison, & Northern (and their predecessors and descendants). Related Service by the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul to Shullsburg, Mineral Point, and Monroe is also included.Service by the Galena & Southern Wisconsin, Chicago & Northwestern, and Burlington & Quincy, is NOT included. Southeast Wisconsin is not mentioned at all. Therefore the book is of limited utility to someone interested in the wider history of transportation in the region.The ""predecessors and descendents"" add up to dozens of companies, most of which never laid a tie. Within the limits of what is covered, it is covered exhaustively."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased a version of this product that was just the software to load onto a PDA. The software continually just shut down and I spent all my time messing with the unit trying to get it to work. Over the course of two months I continually tried to get some help from customer support either by email or by phone. I spoke with a live person twice when I finally got through to someone and was promised they would research the problem and get back with me, this never happened! After two months I went out and bought a GOLFLOGIX unit and could not be happier with the puchase."
2,iGolf,"Unit has a huge appetitte for batteries, better buy shares in Duracell/Energizer.Belt clip is very brittle and snaps off.Must be a defect as iGolf ""sells"" the clips with 5 to a package. Lettering on the toggle buttons wears off. A new user wouldn't know their functions and this makes the unit have little resale value. Periodically it'll lock up and have to be rebooted. Made in China. You get what you pay for. Buyer be ware!"
1,Loses course info in memory all the time,"I have had this for three years. I subcribed to the course download feature which also extended the warranty. Right from the start, the unit would loose loaded course information when turned off. Not all the time but most of the time. It also turned itself off on the course after only being on for 1 hour and fresh batteries. I sent a lot of e-mails to I Golf and got only one reply asking for the serial number of the unit. I sent the info to Igolf and never heard from them again. There is virtually no customer support. I am shopping for another unit now."
2,British Blues Rock?,"A very diverse collection of songs from a once great blues/rock guitarist, this collection seems more a shot at late 70's marketability than a showcase of Green's talents.A mixture of 70's jazz/rock fusion and latin inspired songs, that put me more in mind of Carlos Santana than Peter Green.While there are a few highpoints namely Last Train to San Antone, A Fool No More, and Baby When the Sun Goes Down, I would not recommend this for an introduction to Green's music. If you looking for a good example of Green's guitar work, pick up one of the early Fleetwood Mac or John Mayhall albums."
5,"Great sporty, yet feminine, watch.","I tried on several types of watches of this sort in stores before taking the ""leap of faith"" of ordering this watch over the internet from Amazon. I was extremely pleased when it arrived. It is a nice dual tone watch (the photo had done it justice), sporty, yet feminine and perfect for my small wrist (I am small boned and some of the watches like this were much too bulky on my wrist). The only trade-off was that I had to pay to have a jeweler adjust the band, but considering how much $$ I saved by ordering it from Amazon.com...it was still very worth it. It is a practical watch for a busy Mom, yet dressy and versatile at the same time. I love it."
4,Well done for the thinking mind,This exhaustive volume gives a solid historical and biblical foundations to the main biblical doctrines. I was impressed by his exposition on the End Time. Even though he is taught under a dispensational teacher Alva Mclain he did his exposition fair and sound. I appreciate the fact that at least for the doctrine of the end time he did not exposite Scripture according to an assumed system of teaching. This gives me confidence to trust that he struggled with the different Scripture references.
5,I really Liked this Book,"I really liked this book, and was impressed with the spiritual revelations that occurred through her heavenly experience. It reminds me of another book that I read psychic gifts in the Christian life where the author got struck by lightning and went to heaven, and came back a much different person, and helps heal people now. I can't wait to be there myself - but until then I will try to make heaven on earth."
1,even 1 star is too high,"When I have completed a book, I either donate to public library or pass on. This book I am throwing in the trash."
2,Very Misleading,"I am a follower of Jesus Christ, and I have read this book. This author goes on to call God The Father ""DADDY""? It sounds like she can call him all different cute names. I always thought God was suppose to be called Father, Jehova, Hosanna, or all of them. Not Daddy! Well, idk. If you think this book is true. Good luck"
2,The Heavens Opened,"This book was interesting in some points. It was about her journey into heaven and what she saw while visiting heaven. It is different from any other book I have read of people having Near Death Experiences. I really don't know what to think about this book in relation to the NDE I have read, and I have read many of these books."
1,It's total junk,"I bought the set of GAIAM bands and ALL three of the bands broke under tension after 1 year. Since reasonable exercise tension is what these things are supposed to be used for, and they easily snapped under that tension, I have to say they are completely junk. Don't buy them, it's a waste of money, they don't hold up over time."
1,Not heavy,I got this kit and the bands were not my Idea of heavy at all. Maybe they would be ok for someone who dosen't workout much but for me MMA and heavy weights they weren't enough. I was hopeing for a new tool to add some variety to my routine but this isn't it.
2,"reviewing the presentation, not the wax",I always use Woody wax in my boat and im very happy with it but this presentation is not comfortable. the spounge is very thin ant to little product in it
3,Good for dancing fast merengue,"I think some of the songs are a bit fast, I miss some slower songs. In my opinion there are no really good melodies on this CD - is it because the music is so rhythm based that there is too little room for good melodies? I do not understand Spanish well but the attitude of the songs seems positive. A different reviewer states that the lyrics are comical, however the lyrics are not included in the sleeve notes."
4,Gets better every time,"I must admit that I bought this album solely because the song ""Cachamba"" was on it; however, I soon discovered this was not the only good song on the album. It's a great addition to CD collections and becomes better with each listening. Many songs will make you want to blast your stereo and dance around the room in reckless abandon. If you like merengue or salsa, you're sure to enjoy Kinito Mendez. Fans of ranging from ""Proyecto Uno"" and ""Los Ilegaes"" to ""Fey"" and ""Au-d"" can find middle ground here and enjoy some ""musica fabuloso""!"
5,Fantastic,This book is wonderful. As a school teacher I highly recommend it for any school system. Great job Ms.Rembisz!
5,A catchy book,"This is a cute book especially if you have a dog that sheds. My 3 year old daughter loves hearing about Spencer and even ""reads"" along with me while I'm reading it to her!"
5,"Great little tire at a descent price, good durability","I bought these tires as an upgrade to the 20"" tires that came standard on my bicycle cargo trailer. These roll very smooth, seem to have great durability (over 600 miles on the cargo trailer and not a single flat, and show no signs of wear yet). I typically carry anywhere from 40-70lbs. on the trailer. I even plan on doing some touring with my trailer and these tires will be on it. You cannot beat the price either. I'm sure they in no way compare to, say, a Schwalbe Marathon Plus 20"", but they are one-fifth the price.Bottom line, I think you can trust this tire."
5,Carol Tuttle has changed my perception of life!,"Reading Carol Tuttle's book, Remembering Wholeness, is one of the most life changing events that I have ever experienced. It made me question why the same bad things in my life just kept showing up. And more importantly it helped me to break that nasty cycle that I had been in for way too long. Remembering Wholeness is like looking deep into your own soul and putting in that one crucial piece that connects the rest together. I have learned so many things about myself and answered so many of my ""why's."" I feel that the forces of the universe brought this book to me and if you are reading this, then they have brought it to you also. I would say to anyone reading this that YOU CAN HEAL YOUR LIFE and Carol Tuttle can show you how!"
5,remebering wholeness,"A very uplifting book. It is a book that helps grow faith and inspires hope for the individual. It is full of simple ways to help you throughout your daily life, and one day youwake up to find things are ok, and you feel better."
5,Remembering Wholeness,"Want to be closer to God? Be a better person? Help others achieve these things? Have you searched for wholeness and come up just a little short of the goal? Then this is the book for you! I'm buying it for everyone on my Christmas list. I can't think of a better gift than an instruction manual for achieving one's personal goals, and becoming a better, more caring human being in the process."
2,Lost me early on,"My take on this book is, Carol combines the law of attraction with the biblical themes of God and his influence on our lives. So far so good. However, I could not stick with the book after reading Carol's belief that bad things happen to people who have chosen bad things for themselves. I think she is reflecting the law of attraction in this, that everyone makes a choice whether concious or unconcious, but I can't accept that an innocent person, such as a child or baby, could even have that choice. Even adults, who are strong, courageous people, have suffered violent crime or brutal accidents. I believe things do happen for a reason, and people who are seeking will learn and grow somehow despite adversity, without becoming ""victims"". Unfortunately, although this may not have been the author's intent, this statement came across as so absolute, as if somehow people who have had issues have chosen these situations, that it turned me off to the point that I could not continue."
4,Another Opinion,"I read with regret that K. Miller's review was deleted. I read her review and thought she made some valid points. It didn't seem vindictive or a personal attack to me. Can't we have differing opinions?I read ""Remember Wholeness"", enjoyed it and re-learned many things that I've felt were true throughout my adult life. I thought Carol's book hit the mark on many issues regarding how our beliefs (faith)create our life. However there are some questions I have asked myself: What kind of people would we be if God granted us everything we asked for? Do we in fact know what is best for us in the long run? What about the scriptures refering to the value of trials as learning experiences? What about God giving us experiences that teach us through adversity? Do angels really turn all of our traffic lights green?I think this book has valuable insight on how to operate in life with a higher spiritual awarness but how do we get to that higher spiritual awareness?"
5,Wonderful Work,I am so GREAT FULL for your book...thank you. I have been recommending it constantly to my clients. Wonderful Work...thanks again.
5,a comment on citizen keen's panicked rant,"Your contention, ""[Chomsky's] infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S.,"" is telling, as an index of both extreme right (read: 'arrogant') entitlement Statism, as well as your own personal lapse of reason. That is, an individual's loyalty is owed not to any institution, authority, or State (i.e., no ethic inheres via the neurotic, mass obedience you suggest). Rather, an individual's loyalty is owed--FIRST AND FOREMOST--to what their own informed conscience compels. For Chomsky--as scientist, as educator--this rule abides. ""'Twas ever thus..."""
4,Democracy in the Middle East,"This is in rebuttal to Eric kent of July 30th...Israel is NOT THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, NOR WAS IT THE FIRST! TURKEY WAS THE FIRST! You need to read some history before you attempt Chomsky!"
4,Well Worth a Read,"This book offers a good analysis of the ME conflict. As always, Prof. Chomsky come to the table with a list of references about a quarter size of the book, and a cool logic when looking at the ME. In addition to analyzing the ME situation over 3 decades of writing, he also explores prospects for peace (then and now) and looks at the likely out comes.I gave this a 4 because I have read better by this man, but it is still worth a read.And Take Note: This isn't a book of history on the Israel-Palestine conflict, rather an analysis, a reader would best be served to read up on the past before purchasing this book."
2,Book Review :(,"The book seems to be an academic review of general knowledge reguarding non volatile memories. As an asic designer, I didn't find it useful. The book is best for management or anyone looking for an introduction to the field."
3,A little light humor (best served in the south),"I have to admit, there were moments that I laughed out loud while reading this book. But, there were other moments when I wished the author would just get to the point.Overall, it was a fun, light-hearted, easy read. I am not sure if the humor would have hit me quite right if I had not lived for several years in the south. Also, some of the humor was a bit re-hashed.Because the book was comprised of short unrelated essays, it was easy to put it down when needed and pick up another time."
3,"Hilarious, but crass","I was laughing out loud all over several airports as I read this book. It IS funny, but much more crass and much more derogative of other people than I expected. I was briefly allowed the privilege of living in the South and bought this book as my celebration and induction into the southern belle club. Very true to life, a belly-aching laugh of a read, but you have to be prepared to filter out some profanity, etc. I probably wouldn't buy it again and only gave it to my sister to read because she knows me well enough to know my character. Decide for yourself what you want to take in, and what you don't. 3-star rating is because of the items mentioned above - otherwise it would get a 4."
2,Southern Belle,Thought it would be funny. Just another put down for southern life and from one of our own. Sad. :(
2,"We're Just Like You, Only Prettier: Confessions of a Tarnished Southern Bell","This was a somewhat humorous collection of thoughts, I wouldn't describe it as a book. The author loves gossip and is judgemental to the max. However, I did find myself laughing at some of her remarks."
2,Disappointed,"Having lived in MS and AL my entire life, I had high hopes for a book that pokes fun of my day to day experiences. First of all, the things that the author claims as ""Southern"", really aren't. I have never known anyone in my 30 years to pronounce ""hair"" as ""har"". Maybe I just run in different circles. I found the parenting aspects of the book to be slightly amusing, but found myself bored and unentertained by the random, disjointed thoughts."
2,boring. hard to get into. forced humor.,"I could not force myself to get into this book. I have read several of Celia's other books and did not have this difficult of a time getting interested in it. The style of writing in this one is more of the ""look at me, see how funny I am!!"" forced humor. It's just hard to read. I couldnt finish it and one of my girlfriends who borrowed it and who is an avid reader did not bother to finish it because she was ""just done with it"". I found myself bored and hoping for the end of the story so I could put it down. In all fairness I have not finished it, so the book could get better towards the middle/end. Not worth the time, I just put it down and picked up something else. I'll save it for when I am desperate and perhaps I will change my mind."
4,Another Good Southern Writer,"I enjoyed this book from a new-to-me author. Ms. Rivenbark is a humorist as well as an astute social commentator. She is a southern writer who appeals to folks in any location. No matter where you're from, there's probably someone or many someones in your past that you will recognize in the pages here."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"When I bought this book, I was looking for quality anecdotes with humor sprinkled throughout. However, while some content was mildly amusing, it all seemed a little forced. She is trying too hard to be funny and it does not come off as genuine. It is not what I had hoped for."
4,Funny book,The book is entertaining but I wish the author would leave her political views out of it.
1,Waaaay overrated,"I bought this book on the basis of the title and the reviews, and, as one who was born and raised in the South, I was really looking forward to it. What a disappointment. I read Part I and was hard pressed even to smile. It reads more like a bunch of corny one-liners -- a bad day with the Clampetts -- than a collection of essays, and hardly any of the pieces hang together as coherent, humorous writing. Give me back Erma or Jill Conner Browne. I've put my unfinished copy into the recycling bin."
2,Save your money,"Like most Kindle books, it's full of annoying typos; don't they even try to proofread their OCR scans? The book itself is only slightly amusing, plus one has to slog through occasional snippets of liberal cant. It's not at all worth the price. Too bad there isn't a way to sell used Kindle books; if I could get a buck back to get rid of this one I'd feel lucky."
3,Funny book...leave out the politics,"I found this book to be very humerous and funny, but with an edge. The author REALLY needs to leave her ignorant, ill-informed liberal political views out of the book. These views really ruined the book for me. It would have been much more enjoyable without that. Otherwise, I enjoyed the book."
1,DRM,"I have to admit I have not read this book. I can't. It has DRM on it so I can't convert it for my sony reader. Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but I didnot see any mention of it being DRM before I bought it. This is too bad, because I will not be purchasing any other books from this author."
5,"A book not only about gardening, but about life","There are many things to be learned in the growing, the germinating, the flowering, the pruning, the harvesting, the compasting, the living, the dying, and most of all the watching. This book is filled not only with practicalities for the gardener and philosophies for the human being, but philosophies for the flowers and practicalities for life."
5,A wonderful friend for you and your garden.,"Carol Williams has written a gardening book that is as instructive as it is eloquent, as practical as it is spiritual. I found the book at the library, just after I (nervously) embarked on my first garden. I quickly realized it needed a permanent place in my home, and I bought my own copy. As a rookie, I savored its useful advice and encouraging tone, but with each year of experience, I return to it for so much more. Just a great book."
4,It is off the chain,DJ Mouche is one of my favorite albums and I have over 200 hundred hip hop albums in my collection. It has that new olreans flava to it. From the time I heard this cd I knew it was something special.
5,Track Listing,"This CD is a Japanese import from 1990. The title is ""From The Original Master Tapes"" with a booklet cover of her ""Johnny Get Angry"" album. Here's the track listing:1. Johnny Get Angry2. Theme From A Summer Place3. One Boy4. Ruby-Duby-Du5. I Don't Walk to Walk without You6. When the Boys Get Together7. Memories, Memories8. Since Randy Moved Away9.

I Need Your Love20. Till There Was You"
5,What More Can I Say That Hasn't Been Said?,"Drake, the reviewer above or below this review, made me purchase this CD ... I advice you to do the same.The two major concertos on the first disc were for me the main attractions, and they do not disappoint. The Rach 3rd especially is a must in your collection. It's indeed the one with Reiner (the most praised of all the Horowitz readings).Disc two is filled with, mostly, goodies; moreover, disc one and two combined are together a nice introduction to Horowitz the Pianist."
4,"Pair this with some satellites for a great, low-cost system!",This is a cross post that I originally wrote for theInfinity SAT 1100 Add-on satellite speaker for TSS-1100 Platinum. Please click on that link to see the bargain system I cobbled together. Can't beat the sound for the price.
2,"Read the other Fool books, not this one","I'd thumbed through this book a couple times at the bookstore, but had always decided against it. I should have said that again when another Fool book ""Rule Breakers, Rule Makers"" came up as a ... bargain hardback book and succumbed to the whole in my wallet and got this book too. It's too condescending even for the investing novice, and the workbook part is scant and carries little value beyond the writing. Stick with ""The Motley Fool Investment Guide"" which has almost the same info, plus more."
3,One too far,"The work is a bit basic for the investor, but a useful grounding in personal finance education. There is next to nothing for the more active investor or trader, for which I turned to Mind of a Trader for some of its calculations. Also good was Schwager on Futures for that."
4,I found the book insightful and profitable!,The book was injoyable to read. I found that the information was very helpful. I am looking into reading more of their books. They seemed very acurate on their advice and information. I would definaty recommend it for others to read.
5,I am a BIG fan of Grey's Anatomy,I ordered Season 1 through 7 of Grey's Anatomy and watched Season 8 on Amazon. All the dvds that I ordered thru Amazon were all in great shape.My experience watching Season 8 on Amazon Video on Demand was also a very good experience.The price was right and they played well on my computer.Karenkacolten52@att.net
4,Love it!,"Grey's Anatomy has been one of my favorites since I first discovered. Every season brings in new drama, fascinating characters, and suspenseful plot lines."
4,Good Medical Show,A good medical show with lots of drama. Not big on the romance side of it but a lot of women and romantics would probably love it.
5,Great show!,"The Grey's Anatomy writers do a great job of keeping all the characters interesting. After watching 8 seasons, it feels like we know all of them and know how they'll react, but there are still surprises. This is one of the best seasons ever... with a big surprise ending."
1,Won't load,"Clicked on ""Watch Now"" but the video won't play. I paid $2.00 for nothing. Did I do something wrong? I'm signed in to my account. Not sure what's up with that."
5,Grey's Anatomy,I enjoyed watching this on my kindle. I really enjoy the show and watching since I missed it on TV.
5,Ethics and Practices Clearly Explained,"Written as a guide for museum conservators by a conservator. Presents excellent practical information and presents a code of ethics. Anyone who owns, cares for or commercially works on antiques should read McGiffin's work."
2,"Gimme another translation, man","This review is for the Focus Classical Library version of three Aristophanes plays: Acharnians, Lysistrata and Clouds. The good news is that they are not bowdlerized. The bad news is that the translator, Jeffrey Henderson, got way too funky and hip (ie, dated) with his translation. Characters say ""man"" and use words like ""gimme"", ""wanna"" and ""a__hole"". Some of this kind of thing is appropriate, especially in ""Clouds"", but the translator is trying so hard to be wacky that it becomes a major distraction. A large sum of money is refered to as ""a million bucks"" and so on. A good example of one way in which a translation can go awry."
2,"Whoah now, Mr. Henderson","I have many of Aristophanes' works in several translations, but was required to buy this one for a different class last semester. I was looking forward to a translation with a ""fresh"" perspective, but I guess I wasn't quite prepared.This translation does its best to be current, but it really tries too hard. The plays are rife with weird slang and unnecessary cursing that really detracts from the plays. In some parts the plays are downright vulgar. I am well aware that these were far from chaste plays in their heyday, but I think Jeffrey Henderson went a little too far in an effort to shock his readers, rather than provide historical accuracy. All in all, if you're looking for a novel perspective on Greek theater you may find this captivating. If you are looking for one good copy of Aristophanes' works, keep looking."
5,best wrenches,"These X-beam ratcheting wrenches are WAY better than anything else out there. Very high quality, lots of leverage, and comfortable to use. The extra length is great for stubborn fasteners, but a liability in close quarters. I have both metric and SAE sets."
3,Okay,Decent quality (Taiwanese) but I would prefer a bit higher quality. I wish the ratcheting action was finer and the flex head could be locked. Gearwrench does offer some with the locking flex head feature so I can only blame myself. The X-beam feature seemed nice in theory but in reality provided no advantage because you really can't apply excessive torque to these wrenches since one end has a ratchet ad the other is an open end.
1,not satisfied,"Bamboo sticks a strangely hollow and withered 2 weeks after I bought them, despite watering ... had to throw them out. Also, extremely overpriced for the amount you get."
2,Too perfect to be worth the read,"The characters were too perfect, too simplistic and much too implausible. While feeling their own impowerment, the women in charge seem to almost ignore the women in less-than-perfect living environments, who are taking the brunt of retaliation. Granted, the author gives a small nod to those who are less fortunate, but as the movement grows we hear less from that segment. When was the last time any of us experienced such an overwhelming desire to ""bond"" with those more fortunate than ourselves? I hope I'm not the only reader who could see through the gaps in this plot. It led little to the imagination.As for the audio presentation of this book, I am hoping that the unabridged copy was better than what I heard. The narrator chosen did a good job of voice-changes, but instead of the confident, throaty voice of a woman in charge, she came out sounding like a high-pitched school girl who flirts her way through life. Very disappointing."
1,Dumb dumb,This was a really stupid book. My husband warned me after he read it and I should've taken his advice.
4,What a great read for the beach!,"Anne Faulk's HOLDING OUT is a great read-- thoroughly enjoyable. It is an excellent beach book -- I wish I had waited. Even though you have to pay attention to the various characters' roles, you don't have to have total quiet to read it. The story moves quickly, and, believe me, you want it to so you can find out how and why Lauren ended up where she is, to write this ""memoir"".The subtle --and not-so-subtle-- wit keep it moving. And, while it may fall into the genre of a ""woman's book"", I think even men would enjoy it and should read it -- the story line bears repeating for every generation.The character development for the central characters was well done. When I finished the book, I really felt like I actually knew some of the characters, particularly Lauren and her family. Witty, charming, sexy, fun and funny. In all, a good book!"
2,A bit trashy for my effort,"Now my review will really reflect my taste in books. Jackie Collins, Olivia GOldsmith (etc) have never been my favorite reads. While I can admit that they may be a fun guilty pleasure as you lay by the pool the time it takes to read for the minimal plot is not a fair trade. Such style we read in Holding Out. Before buying be prepared for some explicit scenes (not exactly romantic but definitely HOT) and for a main character who is so stuck on herself I was actually embarassed for her. The dialog is a bit elementary and I felt idealistic to portray the cool,rich characters in a smooth way, but for me it didn't work. Maybe you might feel differently if you like a more ""light"" read, but this is not really book club material. I did get a laugh out of flipping to the Author photo in the back cover, who surprise surprise looks amazingly like the ""heroine"" of the book with their lives played out so much the same."
3,For my music class,"I learned a few things from this book, but it lacks content. Really weird organization of chapters. The words sound robotic and not interesting. Better books out there for learning music."
3,PT boat,"This book gives a colorful naration of the combat records of thePT boats in WW II. However, I noticed that about 61 of the 100photographs were published before, mostly from UNITED STATES PT BOATS OF WW II (1980) and AMERICAN PT BOATS IN WW II (1976, 1997). With hundreds of never published pictures still in the archives and museums, a little more effort in research by the author could contribute greatly to this subject since not toomany books have been written about this subject since the endof WW II.Victor Chun"
4,a good book,i liked this book. it was all about stuff i like. i read it cover to cover more or less. i think you will like it too. think about the thoughts of the ancient vedic rishis and you too will probably get something good out of them. i sure hope so.
5,Forgotten Technologism,"I went in search of this book when I discovered that McLuhan invented a phrase that I had been using (which I formed based on other McLuhanisms, so it wasn't that original to begin with), ""The City is Obsolete"". There it is on the second page of Counterblast, the ""missing"" McLuhan. We all know the ""Medium is the Message"" and some of us know it is also ""the massage"" but few if any, and certainly not me know how to ""blast"" something..until now.Counterblast is a robust critic of all we hold dear. It counter-blasts common values about technology and society. Its opening is a ""Learning from Las Vegas"" flip on the established greatness of ""cities""; something that haunts us today. The computer becomes a city according to McLuhan, thereby presaging social networks. And so much more. This book screams 2011...maybe even 2050. I was Past Shocked by each and every page."
5,Not only Santana & Shorter but Patrice Rushen as well,"One of my favorite Carlos Santana's albums is ""Blues for Salvador,"" released just prior to this concerts with Shorter. There's lots of interplay with Santana's guitar and Shorter's saxophone, though they do take over with their own compositions, which is normal behavior. Rushen is in great form here, doing the keyboards duties and even gets to perform a couple of her numbers as well. There are percussion solos that included Amando Perraza who frequently performs and records with Santana. If you liked Weather Report or Shorter's work with Herbie Hancock or the jazzier albums of Santana, then this is for you."
2,Great expectations... Santana fan. Not keen on Shorter.,"The concert video is on Netflix, which we used to view it. The teaser looked good, and the initial energy was good. I am a fan of Carlos, and have only a passing familiarity with Wayne Shorter, and am not a fan of jazz, but do enjoy much of it. The Hermans, Glenn Miller, Django, Dave Brubeck, Buddy Rich, and Chick Corea are example of my preferences. Miles Davis I can tolerate some times, but only a couple of things in his catalog grab me.So, as great a jazz musician as Wayne is, I just don't appreciate his style of improvisation. Atonal ramblins played on an instrument that is a fraction of a semitone off key drive me up the wall. Carlos' contributions were sparse and had little impact in terms of pulling the mix into a cohesive energy producing experience. I turned it off after about 25 minutes.So, obviously it is a fine time for those who love the Shorter style, but I prefer less complicated fare when it comes to modal improv."
2,surround sound issues,"2 1/2 stars.This is a very good concert teaming up a pre-""grammy"" Santana with Wayne Shorter of Weather Report fame. great rhythm section, drums, conga, timbale. top notch musicians, first rate performance, very entertaining. my big problem comes with the quality of the DVD. I don't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states DD 2.0, DD 5.1 and DTS, the menus are showing something else (DD2.0, DTS 2.0 and DTS 5.1) but neither DTS stream seem to be working. only DD stereo works. I own close to 200 DVD's and all work fine, DTS and all. Bought it directly from amazon, I had it replaced and the new one is the same. This is not part of the great Live at Montreux series productions which are all great, no matter how old the concert is.So the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star DVD quality."
5,Why don't more people know about this book?,"When my now fiance handed me this book and said to read it, I really didn't know anything about it. Now that I've read it, I'm rather shocked that this book isn't better known. I really don't know how it's managed to stay obscure for so long. While reading it, I found myself traveling through the world I've always wanted America to be. The only book I've ever found to be comparable in even the most basic way is J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey.If you have the chance, buy this book. You will read this again and again."
3,Well researched,I found this book to be very well researched and written. For the price I would(and did) expect color photos; a black and white photo backed up with a drawing of the plant just does not cut it and leaves lots of room for question. This is one aspect of the book that has me really disappointed!
4,Guide to Natural Desert Foods,"This book, though a little scientific in its language for a lay person, is a wonderful source for discovering the food that is all around us in the Sonoran Desert. I will use this book as a ""map"" of sorts through my home yard and wilder desert locations. Impressive!"
2,A little dissapointing but still fun,"I received this as a Christmas present, though it had been on my amazon wish list, and though I enjoyed the urban legends, I am glad I did not purchase it myself. I'm a huge urban legend junkie, so I was looking forward to reading many stories that I had never heard before, and though that did happen, the book is more of a textbook as it goes far into detail about what the urban legend means, where is comes from, and how it spread but doesn't actually have many urban legends. After every urban legend, and even before, there is some sort of explination about the legend, which I honestly skipped. Therefore I only read the few urban legends in the book, and finished it in a few hours. Though I tried to skim the summaries, it was just too boring for me.So though I love urban legends, this was dissapointing due to the heavy explinations that I honestly had no intention to read."
3,"Entertaining one-day read, but only for fun","I bought this book to get a better understanding of WHY urban myths and other word-of-mouth stories are passed along in our society. Basically, this is the first of many books later published by Brunvand which documents examples of popular urban legends."
4,Good,"Item was well packaged and in good condition. It arrived a little later than I would have liked, but other than that, I have no complaints."
1,Not A Book About Urban Legends,I bought this book thinking that it was a collection of short stories about urban legends. I was partly right. It does have short stories but it also contains a explaination about each and every one including varations of a story.I would recommend that unless this is a book report for school or college that you should save your money and try and find it in a used book store or buy it used from a seller on amazon. It is not worth the money to buy it new.
4,We all know the stories,"A fabulous introduction into the propagation of urban legend. We already know the stories - the hook or alligators in New York's sewers. The book is appropriate for the general audience, but has an academic twist. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
4,"cool, my first review if the first review on here!","I did like this CD. although I loved the quicker songs, some of the slower ones kinda made me bored. and theres only about 2 quick songs. there would be 4 but these other two are only 10 or 15 seconds long. I thought that was weird. but I do like their style of music. I would recommend this. its refreshing."
5,Reconstructing History,"If you are studying Wright Fliers for the first time, or are an avid consumer of aviation history, this book will do wonders for your understandings of the Wright Brothers and their time in history. If you have already read Kelly, McFarland, and Crouch, you will find a new and revitalized interest.Jakab and Young combine their talents and knowledge of aviation history to weave a few new bits of enlightening knowledge. Their explanations and corrections, that they cite, show that they have put a great deal of time into ""getting a few things straight"". They do a really nice job of tactfully showing the errors in other publications, giving credit where credit is due and help to put things in a proper light. You will enjoy the ride."
1,What a Relief,"If you don't believe that ADD is real, you'll love this book. You'll take it to dinner, cuddle with it at night. You'll whisper sweet nothings to it, while it whispers sweet nothings in return. If you could, you'd marry it and take the book's name as your own.If you have ADD, know someone with ADD, or otherwise understand that ADD isn't an inspired marketing campaign, you'll also like it; one less book to buy, more money for medication."
1,ADHD is the most researched disorder in medical science,"Just look at the facts. If the child had true ADHD, medications are effective60-80% of time. More important is to find out if your child has Learning disorders and other problems which DO NOT improve with medication."
5,Hot Dance Track,"Great club hit and radio friendly. If you like this track, check out tracks from ATC, Serena Paris and Alice Deejay."
5,Hyms Book 1,"What a wonderful and inspiring album! Athena's voice is so beautiful. I especially liked the old hymns-she sang them so appealingly-but I really did like all of the songs. I found this album by accident, or maybe not by accident since it has been such a blessing! I am very glad that I purchased it and will look for other albums by this artist."
3,Perry Cormier from Iowa LA,"Having just seen Mel Tillis in concert a few months ago, I thought I would be seeing a recent concert that was taped for DVD. This is not what this is. This is a release of an old television show, probably late '70's or early '80's. Mel and the band are still great in this, but it would be awesome to have a dvd of one of his latest concerts. The man is a legend."
3,Misrepresented in the DESCRIPTION ---,"THE DESCRIPTON SAYS IT'S 60 MINUETS LONG AND IT'S ONLY 30 MINUETS. THIS IS A MISREPRESENTATION BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT IF THE DESCRIPTION WAS CORRECT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE MISLEADING PEOPLE-THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS. OTHERWISE IT WAS GOOD, I LOVE MEL TILLIS."
4,Joe Posada,Music was very superb and video is definitely outstanding. Enjoyed the selected songs - very lively and made me want to dance.'Excellent feature and beautiful and old school surrounding. Reminded me of my old school days..............This is when music was music.
2,sin,Sin and Sex. What is it? The story is not powerful enough that one may forget it later.Scenes are just too ordinary and not worthy mentioning. A below-average stuff.
1,star power,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAB, THEY BUTCHER THE SONGS, I COULD DO A BETTER JOB SINGING, AND I'M TOTALLY TONE DEAF, YOU WOULD GET BETTER ENJOYMENT IF YOU PUT THE 15 DOLLARS YOU WOULD SPEND ON THIS CD IN FRONT YOU AND SET IT ON FIREKAY RODGERS"
3,What's going on???,"This is the second ficus I ordered from Brussel. The first one, almost a year ago is doing great and a beautiful tree. So I thought I need one for my office and ordered this one. The tree came, and my excitement and anticipation died a quick dead. This one is much smaller than the last one, has no branches and looked like a few leaves sprouted out of some roots. Very weird looking, only about 4"" total height, with a very small rectangular pot. Yes, no resemblance to the picture in Amazon.Thought I need to mention that this is the first time Brussel disappointed me. OK..Brussel, don't make me think that ordering from you guys is like getting a box of chocolate, you don't know what you get until you open it up.."
2,Brown Leaves,I read all of the positives reviews before placing an order for thie Bonsai and was optomistic about having this shipped to someone in CA since there shouldnt be any issues with cold weather or snow. The plant was packaged great! and I watched over Skype him opening the box up only to see that 99% of the leaves were dark brown in color. The package indicated that its normal to see about 20% of the leaves to fall however within 2 days they were all falling off. I have since returned this plant and chose a different style.
1,Leaves all Brown,This was going to be a Christmas gift.I opened this package as soon as I got it. The leaves on the tree were all brown. Not one note on caring for the tree. It was really sad to see such a sick tree. I would love to try to nurse it back to health but I don't want to gamble my money away if I can't. I will be shipping this back today. I tried to call them but they said I had to go thru Amazon for any questions or returns and they wouldn't speak with me.
5,Cute and Sturdy,"I received two of these little trees as a birthday gift. Because I wasn't expecting them and because the UPS guy failed to leave a proper notice on my door, the poor things sat in the box for an extra three days until the security guard in my building informed me I had a delivery. The plants were well-packed and still in perfect condition. One month later they are thriving and doing beautifully in my windowsill.Edit (8/21/09): My two trees are 9 months old and still doing well, sitting in my windowsill in sunny Los Angeles. I water them every other day with the exception of the one time it completely slipped my mind for almost a week in the height of summer. Nearly all of the leaves on one of my plants had withered and died, and just over half on the other plant. I figured they were goners, but after plucking all the dead leaves and resuming a constant watering schedule, the leaves came back just as green, plentiful and even fatter than before."
1,Golden gate ficus indoor bonsai tree,"I ordered this tree, on November 29, 2006, it was delivered December 5, 2006. It was frozen when it was delivered, needless to say, it now looks dead. The box said 2 day air, but it wasn't. I'm very disappointed with this item. Was supposed to be a gift. but now it's dead. Becareful of ording plants in the winter time. I live in Michigan. It must have set in the UPS office for a few days in a freezer or something."
5,Incredible Item,My first tree I have purchased online and was VERY HAPPY. Tree arrived very well packaged and was bigger than advertised and in incredible shape. I'm now a lifetime Brussel's customer!
2,bugs all over it,"I received the tree today, and when i got it out of the package it had small bugs crawling around everywhere...I decided to go to my local nursury and i found some bonsai tree's that looked better and were alot cheaper."
1,Not impressed,The bonsai tree is almost dead in few days the leaves are falling just after one day of arrival.I am still trying to maintain it butIt looks almost dead. I am not satisfied at all with this product. I generally don't write reviews but this time every day I see the bonsai I get upset of buying it online. I should have put extra dollar and buy it from store. I even took pics but don't know how to attach it on review.
3,Didn't last long,"I bought this as a gift for someone who had previously owned Bonsai trees. It lasted about 2 months and died. Not sure if the plant itself was infected, might have been a fluke."
3,Not sure if I like it yet,"I bought this plant together with a Money Tree. Money Tree is growing like crazy, this one not so much. It is rather loosing leaves. Not sure if discriptions about growing conditions were not accurate( I picked not too much sun, more shade), or the plant is not up to par."
2,Disappointed in Brooklyn,"I was very disappointed when this ficus arrived. Many leaves had dropped off but the worst part was that there were so many leaves which were blackened with some sort of insect infestation in the plant. Rather than going through the trouble of repackaging it and delivering it to be sent back... I placed it in new soil, spread powered insecticide in it and put it in a larger pot and will hope for the best. I was very surprised that this plant was delivered in this condition. I ordered this because of the many positive reviews even though there were some also complaining about the problem I mentioned."
1,Just Weird,"The little ""tree"" certainly looked healthy; yet the ""trunk"" was really weird - a bulbous ""v"" shape coming up to a top that had no branches, just a puff of stems with leaves. Had it not had a confined root system in a small pot with a wire it had grown around, I would have sworn someone had just chopped off a bush, let it sprout back and then dug up the plant and called it a bonsai. I took it to work to make sure it wasn't just me. Everyone agreed it was weird and ugly."
3,"Misleading description, but nice plant.","The first tree I ordered was badly scarred by wires. The company replaced it quickly with a very nice tree that had a great shape. The ficus is great if you have little natural light. My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light. That said, this is NOT a tree for beginners. Ficus are notoriously finicky. They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day. Each time you vary the routiine significantly, it will drop all of its leaves. Moreover, this plant was hard to water. The pot doesn't have enough room for the water to soak in, so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience. It needs to be watered daily.In short: good choice if you just don't have any good light, bad, bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel."
4,Brussel's Golden Gate Ficus Indoor Bonsai Tree,"Remarkably, the plant arrived in excellent condition, solidly packed, and healthy. It has thrived in limited light and with a cavalier attitude towards watering. The care instructions recommended using an overflow bowl to retain water, but none was included with the product, and I couldn't locate one that was compatable with the attractive pot in which it was planted. I wound up having to repot the tree in order to comply with the instructions"
1,disappointed,"When the tree arrived the leaves were green with a brownish tint, however, I figured since it came in a box that it just needed some light and water. Unfortunately, less than two weeks later the plant is dead and Amazon will not give a refund or provide a replacement since they say the provide no guarantees. Extremely disappointed."
5,Bonsai,"Love the Bonsai. Have it placed in a prominent location. Very easy to take care of. Get raves everytime someone sees it. It was very carefully packaged, plant arrived undamaged, even though the Mudman's feet were broken, a little crazy glue fixed him right up."
2,Bonsai Tree seems almost dead,"When I got the tree in the mail half the leaves were already brown and crispy. I hoped that with water and sunlight I could nurse it back to health but it has now been almost a week and the leaves are almost all dead. I keep it watered and in sunlight but it seems to only be dying completely rather than coming back to full-health. I want to contact the seller but I can't find any information of how to do so. Does anyone have any tips for my bonsai or of how to get a hold of the seller? This would be greatly appreciated. I love the shape of the bonsai and it is so fun to have I just wish it would stay healthy! Let me know if anyone has any suggestions or information for me, thanks!"
5,"It fits! It's my design, my details.","I am a happy born again dressmaker, after having given up and quilted for a long time. Thanks to this book I can decide what I want, use my map to make a pattern, and wear my sewing skills instead of hanging them on the wall. If you follow the book, and you will most likely need a buddy, you will have a working map of your body and the directions to create patterns for the vast majority of basic styles we really wear. This is a customized sloper and introduction to patternmaking and design. There's a ton of valuable information crammed into this book, even if you don't create the bodymap. Bodymapping is not designed to help you alter commercial patterns. It is designed to free a serious sewer, enabling confident creativity."
4,interesting book,"a class i took used this book, i sold the book after the class ended, for $70, but i'm looking for an opportunity to buy one back in a few years when the price goes down, so it must be a good book, alright. the graphics stick in your head, and the book develops a sense for geometry, it gives you more of a feel for how the math explains the geometry. prerequisites for understanding it might be just high school math, but then knowing some college math is also helpful of course, it was a while ago, but i remeber multivariable calculus and linear algebra in there"
5,Geometry,"It is a beautiful book to support University course""Foundations of geometry"" for undergraduate students."
4,Just right!!,This bumper guard protects without being to big too be logicaL on the Dakota. Well made.
2,Not the best.,"I have been working with network cables for years in school systems. I have just spent a day working with these connectors, and I am not impressed. These look like quality connectors, and the metal casing makes them appear to be heavy-duty so they would stand up to the stresses that teachers can put on a patch cable when frequently plugging and unplugging cables into their laptops.BUT--- the connectors seem to have a hard time making the necessary connections both on the computer end and on the switch end. The pop up tab that locks the connector in place doesn't pop up high enough, and the cable will dislodge easily. When I bent the tab to make it work better, some of the tabs broke off, so I had to redo the fitting.In fairness, the cable connectors were easy to make up and crimp, but the frustration in getting the finished cable to stay in place will keep me from purchasing this brand again."
2,At Last! A Pastels Album You Can Enjoy (Almost),"There are a lot of very clever and talented musicians on this - unfortunately, none of them are The Pastels. The remixers art has rendered the artist whose actually being remixed irrelevant - which when it come to The Pastels can only be a good thing. The most puzzling thing about this CD is why genuinely talented artists like Jim O'Rourke and Kevin Shields should waste their time with an indie dinosaur like The Pastels - I suppose the alchemical urge to turn base metal into gold must have been too strong.This is listenable, which is major advance for The Pastels, unfortunately there's still too much of Stephen's bronchial moose vocals and 40 year old adolescent whining for my liking."
3,A short biography,"This is a short biography of Einstein. It is very easy and joyfull to read. It is not very serious biography, it does not go into details, double lined short stories, cover major stages of his life. I recommend to all who wants a brief summary but nice one. I read it in one day, you do not want to drop the book. Very nice."
2,Delightfully awful,"This game is a train wreck and one of the titles that hastened Atari's withdrawal from the industry. Basically, Virtua Racing on the Genesis looks and plays better. There is no texture mapping, the geometry has so few polygons it's hard to even tell what everything is, and the game often dips to what seems below 10 fps. And to be extra sadistic, the career mode makes you go through 10 to 15 laps to finish a race. the only redeeming aspect is that despite all the control flaws and glitches, the career mode is beatable, if your willing to commit the hours to even complete it, which is a bigger waste of time than using a vacuum cleaner on the sidewalk. It's a historic testament to the Jaguars dismal failure. Certainly an anti-classic for collectors only."
1,...Lame,"I recently purchased this game to add to my Jaguar game collection. I remembered playing it when I had a Jaguar years ago, and remembered it being dull. Its pretty much the worst racing game I have ever played, it can't even compete with SNES/Genesis 16 bit racing games. The car is impossible to control and the game feels like they rushed development to meet some deadline. Virtua Racing for the Sega Genesis is worlds ahead. The cheap price reflects the poor quality of this game. Skip it!"
3,A bit overrated,"I have to agree with the viewer from Pennsylvania below me. This movie isn't quite as good as all the fans say it is. It's funny for the forty minutes, but the second half lacks the laughs and just turns into a laughless blood fest. I did thoroughly enjoy this film's sequel, Army of Darkness, and felt that it was a lot better than Evil Dead 2."
5,"Funny as ""HELL""","A mixture of comedy and horror. The concept is scary and the scenes are hilarious. I own all three evil dead movies, but this one is my favorite. Directed by the same guy who directed Spiderman, Sam Raimi."
5,"Classic comedy horror cult movie , a must to see","There is horror , there is spatter , and there is comedy. This classic combines all 3 in a superb blend of slapstick comedy with for that time period good splatter. A must have for the serious movie collector. A somewhat sick state of mind is required to enjoy the moore subtle parts of the movie. If you have missed it buy it now."
4,Good but not great,"This movie is a good movie. It isn't scarry but is hilarious(in some parts). This is my least favorite of the Evil Dead Series. It just doesn't make any sense! Watch the greatest horror film ever, Evil Dead, then watch Evil Dead 2 and tell me I'm not right! The special effects were better, but the story was not near as good as ED 1. The possesions weren't near as scarry. But you should still see this movie. Also, check out Army of Darkness."
4,The Classicest of Cult Classics,"The teaming of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell is, to say the least, an extremely animated collaboration. Raimi's unique and riveting visual style matched with Campbell's brilliant physical acting bring life (or perhaps ""undeadness"") and humor to an otherwise mindless gore film. The plot is weak. The dialogue is horribly lame. There are quite a few technical flaws. But don't let these things trouble you; they actually add to the hilarity that gives Evil Dead II its charm.-B"
4,"Great movie,lousy packaging","I purchased this movie, one of my all time favorites, in great anticipation of adding it to my blu Ray collection. Pretty disappointed that when I received it, the packaging looked all shriveled up and worn, as if it had sat outside overnight in a rainstorm and then someone tried to salvage it with a blow drier. Kind of lousy that anyone would even try to pass this item off to someone as a ""new"" purchase. Extremely disappointed."
2,The Silly Dead,"If your looking for scares and shocks from this movie you won't get them. Well there's a few. The Film opens the same way the first evildead movie did (why would Ash go back to the same house, snd takehis new girlfriend??). anyway soon she becomes possessed,poor Ash is minus another girlfriend to the deadites.Ok I'll cut to the chase theres some cool scenes, The one where hisheadless girlfriend is chasing him around the woodshed with a chainsaw. The other few scenes I liked was when Ash's hand becomes possessed by his girlfriends head. (It fallls in his lap) she bites him and he goes nuts trying to get it off.soon he lops it off and it starts running around the house but notbefore it beat's [up] Ash. Man he's got staminaOtherwise It was a dissapointment to me"
2,Horror?,"Well, I think this movie isn't about horror. It's just a kind of child's playing! This is a real ridiculous movie. my advice? don't buy it!"
3,Funny as hell.,This one ind of scared me a little the first time i watched it. But now when i am down and need a good laugh i watch this movie.
4,"Hilarious ""horror"" film","Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn caught me completely by surprise. Having not read reviews or plot summaries of this movie, I thought I was going to watch a terrifying horror film with realistic looking demons and zombies and lots of blood and gore. Instead, I watched a somewhat scary but very funny movie with fake looking demons (that are actually well done for an extremely low budget) and gallons of blood, but that only leads to the fun. Bruce Campbell's over-the-top acting makes you just want to laugh. The scenes involving him and his dead girlfriend, Linda, are definitely the best. I haven't seen Evil Dead or Army of Darkness although I am very interested in watching Darkness. Are the special effects in Army of Darkness exactly the same as in Evil Dead 2 or are they up to high standard horror films?"
3,Evil Dead Series,The horror genre has gotten way too serious. The Evil Dead series reminds us how much fun getting scared by silly special effects can be.
2,Not Worth It,"Do not upgrade. Picture has a fuzzy quality to it. Not saying it's horrible but really there is no reason to upgrade from the dvd version. I also purchased Dawn of the Dead and there was an immediate quality difference, well worth the upgrade. Unfortunately there just isn't enough of a quality upgrade for Evil dead 2 to make an extra dip worth it. Real Bummer."
3,"dissapointing, not as good as the first","After reading the reviews, I thought I was in store for a gore-fest. In reality, Evil Dead 2 offers lots of blood flying around but very little visual gore. Many times there was a good opportunity for gore, but the camera just turned away. Even in the documentary they explain how they used black blood in one scene instead of red in order to get a better movie rating []. I felt ripped off after watching this movie, and it left me wondering what everyone sees in it. People say this movie is funny but I did not see it. The best part was when Ash's dead headless girlfriend came after him with a chainsaw, but once again the scene ended with the camera turning away..."
4,stupidity as an art form,"This has to be the most idiotic movie I have ever seen. We expected a ""Dawn of the Dead"" type zombie flick, but got this sophomoric drivel instead. For this we are grateful, as we still haven't stopped laughing."
5,the greatest horror movie ever!!!,"great special effects, great story/plot, great demons and music, what else could you want in a movie?"
5,A must to have ...,"Fan or not ... you must have this ""Book Of The Dead 2"" edition.Just one bad point to say if you compare Evil Dead 2 ""Book Of The Dead"" with the first Evil Dead ""Book Of The Dead"" ... this dvd is just in English !No other language selection !Otherwise a very very good quality for this product.Real fine and a little surprise if you push the white eye."
4,Evil Dead II is fun to watch,evil dead 2 is a fun movie to watch again and again it never get's old i watched like 20 time's and it's still as good as the first i watched it.it could have ben better on blu-ray the picture is not good on blu-ray it look the same as regular DVD and the sounds is real bad on blu-ray it sounds just like a regular DVD.the effects is good NO cgi and this movie is real bloody and goofy.the movie get a 5 out of 5 but for blu-ray it get a 3 out of 5.
5,Quick delivery!,"Like the title says, it was delivered quite quick, and effort had clearly been put into packaging the DVD properly. A+ for efficiency!"
5,Fantastic,One of the greatest movies of all time just got better on Blu-ray. The quality is great. It has tons of features and extras that will keep you hooked for a month or so. I highly recommend this product.
5,The Follow Up to Evil Dead,"Well the second Evil Dead is not as Scary as the First One. Of course they had a little more Money and the Effect's are a little better, butit also had a little bit of twisted comedy to it.All in All it is a cool Movie and if your a Fan of the First Evil Deadyou will want to See it."
3,A bit better than the first.,"Funny, yet ""terrifying"" sequel to Evil Dead. Increased gore with mediocre acting--all done in good fun!Recommended."
4,As good as the first,The sequel to the original Evil Dead kind of takes it in a different direction. This is actually a remake of the original so don't get confused with the beginning of the film. The movie is actually more of a comedy than horror. The acting is alot better than the first one.And Sam Raimi kind of learned from his mistakes from the original.It still has errors but is much better. Evil Dead 2 has less gore than the original but is more entertaining than the orignal. You will enjoy it just as much as the original. The ending to this will leave you wanting more.
3,need better sound,did not have that good movie sound from blue ray the sound needed to be better movie is goodevel dead 2 blue ray
2,Incredible movie - terrible looking transfer,"title says it all, the movie is a classic, but the source material (film, very old, very cheap, film) shows all of its flaws. Grainy, dark (or badly contrasted), and frustrating to watch. I'd rather watch my VHS copy than this one again. I love the movie, but this one BADLY NEEDED CLEANING before it was put on blu-ray"
3,"EVIL DEAD 2, A cult classic","The crossing of the horror, comedy genres give this movie a spoof like quality. A wacky look at demonic possesion, self mutilation and the ultimate good verses evil story make this film highly enjoyable and will be watched over and over again. Sam Raimis melodramtic macabre images mixed with a comedic twist make this movie totatly hillarious. Bizarre enough to become a cult classic yet entertaining for anyone with a sense of humor."
3,"Goood movie, but not a good BR buy","Well I already knew the movie and I liked it before, but now that I think about it, what's the purpose of buying a BR of a grainy old movie? To see it ""clearly"" grainy? Anyways, think I would've been better off just buying the regular DVD. So, movies OK, but BR what's the point?"
1,DON'T BUY!!!,I love the movie. Its just the blu ray that sucks.It is the same thing as the 2000 version. I suggest to keep your original copy. Don't waste your money for this!
2,"So stupid, it's funny","The sequel to Stephen King's, The Evil Dead. I don't know why, but is there something about writers who just have to make a sequel to practically every Stephen King classic out there and transform it into a laughing stock? The plot continues where the original left off, on an isolated heath with a cabin. Bruce Campbell and his wife go to stay in this cabin, little realising that the cabin is inhabited by murderous evil spirits. But as the bodies pile up Bruce must fight for survival if he wants to defeat the evil once and for all. this film though ludricous, is watchable. Stupid this film may be, but at the same time it made my sides split open with laughter!"
1,it was a terrible movie,"This movie is not only boring, but DEFINATELY NOT worth a five star rating. I have seen many, many of the classics and it is not up to par with any of them. If you watch both evil Dead movies...it does not make any sense. Ash drives up to the cabin with his girlfriend Linda in the first movie. He beheads her with her a shovel. In the second one her has a girlfriend , Linda, who is beheaded with a shovel the same exact way. Hello....Does this make sense to anyone. I'm sorry, but it definately lives up to its name....Sequel. Even if it were meant to be humorous it is lacking in that too."
2,"Too many ""special editions"" for all these in the series.","I'm getting tired of buying all the ""special edition"" DVDs with Bruce Campbell in them... great movies but FFS I now own about 23 (not kidding) different DVD/VHS of the Evil Dead series and I'm not even close to a collection. Every halloween/xmas theres three more new ""editions"" or some gimmicky packaging.Theres about 1% different material on this DVD than the non-special-edition one.They must have taken the Gene Simmons School of Marketing course."
2,All Gore With Little Imagination,"The sole survivor of the first massacre in the cabin returns with his girlfriend, and the whole thing starts all over again. This time there is quite a bit chainsaw mutilations and wise cracks from the cast. Just about as much gore as the first, but no nearly as original. Shocking ending."
2,Maybe it was good in the 80's,"Maybe had I watched it in the 80's I would have given it a better rating. As it was, it kinda sucked."
5,The sequal to the Ultimate in Grueling Terror,"What do you get when you cross Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, a pound of latex, and buckets of blood. You get the most horrific, hilarious, horror movie of all time. Sam Raimi's brilliant mix of horror and comedy turns Evil Dead 2 into a non-stop ride through insanity. But its undeniable that the movie would never be as great without Bruce Campbell as the chainsaw wielding, zombie slashing, catchphrase spewing, hero Ash.Believe me, this movie is ""Groovy!"""
5,One of the funniest movies of all time,"This is of the all-time greats. This movie has zombies, evil spirits, reel-to-reel players, a 1968 Delta 88, and a chainsaw weilding maniac from housewares. This is a movie you have to see to truly appreciate."
4,Evil Dead 2 not what you think,"Ok, first off this is not actually a sequel to the first movie. It is more of a remake with a new twist, but nonetheless it is a great movie. Raimi and Co. could not get the stock footage from the first Evil Dead, so they decided to re-shoot the movie as a remake of sorts. I would say that ED2 is more of a black comedy than a horror movie, but it still carries enough scares to be good. The character of Ash comes into his own in this movie. It is a great movie alone or to be watched after viewing Evil Dead, but be prepared. If you are view both of them for the first time, it can be a tad confusing, but all in all I would recommend these movies to anyone."
2,"Starts good, concludes in a tiresome manner","I somewhat agree with the viewers from San Francisco and Atlanta below. This film isn't worthy of a five star review, but it does provide a good share of laughs. But by the conclusion, all the laughs are gone, but there aren't any scares to add to the film. Bruce Campbell's performance is not bad, but he should stick more with the one-liners from Army of Darkness, which is a much better film."
5,not a sequel,"This isn't a sequel as you might think at first glance at the title. Instead it is a superior remake of the original ""Evil Dead"". This won awards for its special effects and they are indeed pretty impressive if gory. The plot is a bit weak perhaps but frankly I don't think we are to take this as a serious commentary on the occult or anything like that. Bruce Campbell is amazing to watch and that is good because I'd 70% of the movie is just him battle unseen forces of evil."
3,Better special effects than the first,"This is apparently the version Sam Raiimis wanted to make but didnt have the money or the experience at the time, hence Part 1.Part 1 is special because it was a film that almost didnt see the light of day. Filmed in 1979 but not released until 1982.This sequel was made in 1987 and has excellent special effects which make Part 1's effects look very amateurish.Die-hard collectors will want all three of the series. I can't say I am a huge fan but appreciate the origins of this series."
5,Excellent!! Bigger than jebuzz!,"You can see that Bruce started coming into his style as a smart alec hero in this movie. The Evil Dead tilogy is the king of all B movies hands down! If you like the movies, check out Bruce's book ""If Chins Could Kill, The Confessions of a B Movie Actor"". It has plenty of Evil Dead facts and trivia."
4,Fun and Gory,Loved this movie when it came out in the 80's. It's not scary as much as gory. Crazy chaotic evil fun. What the devil can happen to this guy next? Good for making the date squirm in her seat. There is something somewhere that will gross out just about anyone. The FX are old school but the story is a fun rollercoaster ride of demented evil. Enjoy!
4,Evil DVDs,"I've waited patiently for years for a possible Evil Dead trilogy box set to be released. I sat and watched version after version of each of the 3 films be released in different DVDs with different features.What I would have liked to happen was there to be an essential collection.Now that I'm relatively sure it's not going to happen anytime soon, I decided to buy The Evil Dead 1 and 2 Book of the Dead editions and Army of Darkness (Boomstick Edition)I have no complaints about the packaging or features, but I would still like to see a definitive box set in my lifetime."
5,Best cult flick of all time,"I dont know, but every time i watch this movie i end up laughing so hard i cry. My friends think im insane, but I guess they just dont get it...Ash rules! Dont forget to check out Army of Darkness, its almost equal in laugh a minute format."
4,I guess this was a cool movie...,"First of all this movie had almost no talking or plot in it until about an hour into it--I bet Ash didn't even speak a page worth of dialog. The first hour is just filled with scene after scene of Ash getting attacked by different demons and spirits. This movie had some redeeming value though, I thought almost every scene had something laughable about it! When you pop in this movie, within the first ten minutes I guarantee you'll be like ""What the hell did I buy this for?"" but then after you finish watching it you'll probably think it was great."
4,dark comedy mixed with gore,this is just as good as the 1st but this one has alot of dark comedy which works very well with this film. they even tried to change the color of the blood too try and escape an NC-17 ratingvery funny and very dark
5,What beats Evil Dead?,LOVE this movie...Bruce Campbell is awesome. Sam Rami is a genius. Elizabeth Leschender loves ham sandwiches though. It's pretty scary.
3,unbelievable,This is a movie that only Bruce Camblell can star in..its fun and crazy..it fit in for the time when zombie and dead back to life movies were the rage
4,Great,It's a classic that should be watched by many. This movie brought so many ideas to table and made the horror/action genre a little bit more awesome.
1,This is hilarious!,"Unitenntionally hilarity? Well, this is the best. It's so bad, it's good. Bruce Campbell, perhaps the only thing he says in this film is ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" You'll love it."
1,Don't Buy This!,"Don't buy this one!One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.Don't waste your money on this!Better buy these horror movies:""Resident Evil"", ""Feast (unrated)"", ""Severance"", ""Return of the living dead V - Rave to the grave (unrated) (available in Canada)"", ""Black X-Mas (unrated) (the new version)"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre - The Beginning (unrated)"", ""Wrong Turn"", ""Wrong Turn 2 (unrated)"", ""Wrong Turn 3 (unrated)"", ""28 weeks later"", ""Planet Terror"", ""Hostel (unrated)"", Hostel 2 (unrated)"", ""Saw IV (unrated)"", ""The Hills Have Eyes (Unrated)"", ""Hatchet (unrated)"", ""Halloween (the Rob Zombie version, not the boring old version)"", ""The Descent (Original Unrated Cut)"", ""See no evil"", ""Dawn of the dead (unrated)"", ""Land of the dead (unrated)""or vampire horror movieslike the Blade Trilogy or Underworld Trilogyor Sci-Fi horror movieslike the Alien Quadrilogy or Doom (unrated)Kind regards,MarkMark-Stephan Wendt(Germany)"
5,Classic Fun!,One of the funniest movies of all time. So many great and fun moments are packed into this movie. The hand and chainsaw moments are hilarious! The redneck Jake strong-arming everyone is killer funny. Lots of over-the-top gory action. You'll be laughing from start to finish. Great to watch with a group of friends. That will guarantee a fun night! Can't miss with this movie.
4,Killer packaging!,"I hadn't seen this film since I had rented at the library while in high school, and it was great fun to relive it again in this DVD edition. The packaging was my main motivator to purchase; honestly, how can you resist a monstrosity like that?! I won't say too much about the film, as many other commentators have done just that, but in terms of features and packaging, this gets an A+. Weeks after receiving this, my roommate's niece touched the book's eye on the cover, and it screamed! Who knew? Great fun, but probably not the best to leave lying around impressionable three-year-old children... :)"
1,Just Crap,"Not gonna waste more words---not good. Must add 14 more words for this review to ""take"", so here they are."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A sequel-cum-remake to the original Evil Dead, EDII strives for a combination of slapstick and horror that, while amusing, cannot match the raw horror of the original."
4,First one is best,Sam Raimi made again.But not as good as the first one.In the first film everything's excellent but i cant say same things for this film.He couldnt give the first film's tune.But the cast's r flawless.Shortly if u want to have an evil dead collection u should buy this.But not enough.
5,So much better than the first...,"Basically the premise is exactly the same as the first Evil Dead film. Ash and his girlfriend go up to spend the weekend at a deserted cabin that contains the book of the dead. Evil Dead 2 is so much more accomplished in terms of special effects and cinematography. Some of the shots in this film are nothing less than spectacular (when Ash gets hit by the evil force and gets driven through the forest at 100 mph). The camera work is amazing and Raimi speeds up the film shots at exactly the right moments (when Ash's hand turns against him). The ending is simply awesome and leads directly into Army of Darkness. Evil Dead 2 has everything: lots of gore, some classic Ash lines, superb FX, and top notch cinematography. Every true horror collector should own this film."
4,Evil Dead II,"The follow up to the creepy Evil Dead is actually a remake of the same but on a more high scale level. The transfer is quite good, but again, this movie is not that old so the original print is not that dated. While the first of the series focused on a more surreal set, the follow up relies heavily on physical slapstick and extreme gore. You will either find yourself totally creeped out or laughing too hard at some of the effects and send ups of horror films. Either way, this is highly recommended viewing for fans of the horror genre. Mostly overlooked upon it's original screening, this is fast becoming a cult classic. Get it while it's not!"
4,Hilarity Horror,"Evil Dead 2 is one outrageous movie. It seems to go for the jugular for laughs. Evil Dead is almost the opposite in intent of the movie than Evil Dead 2. Evil Dead was a horror movie with some humor, on the other hand, Evil Dead 2 is a humorous movie with some horror. The hilarious parts of Bruce Campbell being attacked by his own hand and the scene of looking in to a mirror and I will not ruin what happens when he does. A purely entertaining film, better than the first! GRADE: A-"
4,"Very good, but....","This movie was very good, but it really threw me off in the beginning when just Ash and Linda drive up to the cabin. Where the hell are the other people? If you just glaze over the first 5 minutes, and skip up to where the last left off, when the Evil gets right up in Ash's face, you should be fine, because the movie is great otherwise from the part of the prologue with Ash and Linda. Especially good is the scene when Ash and the furniture break out laughing together!"
4,A PERFECT BALANCE OF COMEDY & HORROR !,Sam Raimi's 2nd installment to the EVIL DEAD series is absolutely out of control! This is truely one of the best horror comedies ever made by far! Simpley because the SCARY parts are very very scary & the FUNNY parts are very very funny & Sam Raimi once again goes nuts with the camera. This is one of my all time favorites!
1,I know I am suppose to love the movie but,It's no evil dead 1. I could not get through the first 30 minutes. I know it's a horror comedy but they should have kept this one buried in the forest
4,evil but grainy,"This is one of the best horror movies of the 1980's. That being said starz could have done a better job cleaning up the grainy picture. It is still a improvement over the standard dvd release though. Therefore it is a welcome addition to my collection. However I am going to email starz and ask them why at the more expensive prices of blu ray that they don't treat each release like a special edition. After all few of us are going to replace this version with a new blu ray version that costs 40.00 just to get deleted scenes. At this price all blu rays should be treated as special editions and deliver any deleted scenes that such a edition would have. Starz is not the only company doing this either. So it is worth the effort to email any studio and say that if you expect us to pay these higher prices, then we should expect it to be released like a special edition."
1,Scary - if you're 10 years old,"I can't believe the reviews of this movie - they must be little kids who like this movie. This flick had the cheesiest special effects I've seen on any movie since Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, and was about as scary. What a huge disapointment! This movie is BAD - no two ways about it. Stick to the original Night of the Living Dead."
1,"Sequel heaven, make room","Lead character from the first is back but this time the entire film has a different plot. Now, he only came up to the cabin alone with his girlfriend and as the basic events from the first take place, a group of people stumble onto HIM. And the whole thing falls apart. Pretty stupid sequel turns whatever scares it had to give into silly putty and just goes for the motoroil gore that doesn't work. The result is one of the worst sequels of all time. The only sequence with any laughs is the part when the room is laughing at him. A time waster at best."
1,Terrible. Doesn't compare to the first Evil Dead.,"This movie was one and a half hours of torture. The first movie was bad, but at least it was humorous. This poor attempt at a sequel was nothing short of a dud. The jokes were too strained, and it was clear that there was an attempt at humor. The first Evil Dead was superior in its comic side because the humor was (or at least seemed) unintentional. This film... I cannot speak another word. I recommend you skip this one and skip to the much worthier sequel, Army of Darkness."
1,"Horror not, comedy yes.","When I viewed this movie I thought it would be a scary filmfollowing the first masterpiece. Well, I was wrong. The movie suckedand had pathetic special fx. I recommend only part 1 if you enjoy terror."
5,Funny and the best of the trilogy.,"Evil Dead 2 is by far one of the best sequels ever,but one of the funniest horror films ever made. Ash returns to the same cabin as in part one and all havoc runs wild again. Most fans of the series would probably find this one to be the most entertaining."
2,"Not terrible, but neither is it great","Evil Dead 2 seems to me as one of the most overrated horror-comedies of the 80's. I did laugh at certain scenes, but most of it is rather dull and bland. There are much better horror-comedies out there like Army of Darkness, Tremors, and Re-Animator."
5,Classic Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell,"Cult classic, best one in the series for it's use of dark comedy and campy special effects. Bruce Campbell is perfect for this role with his wild facial expressions and use of prop comedy. This movie will be timeless and still enjoyable in another 30 years."
4,A great family movie!( If iyourthe adams family)A classic,A remake of the first evil dead. It's more comical than the first installment as ash the chainsaw bearing triger happy badass battles more of the evil dead. I thought it was a great movie and am glad it is now avable agian. Army of darkness picks up were evil dead2 leaves off it was almost called evil dead3 but universal studios wanted the movie to stand on its own.Hope you injoy it as much as I did. END
4,"More mayhem and horror than ""The Evil Dead.""","So Evil Dead gave you the creeps, but you want some more, huh? Well, then buy this hunk of junk 'cause this ain't no junk! It's Evil Dead 2, baby coming at you starring Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie Wesley, & Richard Domeiner! Ash is back and he's not in Disneyland! He's still in the cabin, in the woods! This time, 4 people, a hillbillie and his gal, a scientist, and the daughter of Professor Knoby, without any idea enter the cabin discovering Ash! You'll laugh and be terrorized! Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn is in letterbox presentation and has be digitally mastered for optimum sound & picture quality! You'll love it. END END"
4,Engaging Comic Horror Film,"""Evil Dead II"" does not so much strike me as a sequel to ""The Evil Dead"" but a reworking of the first film. Director Sam Raimi seems to be more confident in his prowess behind the camera as well as a storyteller. The horror here is leavened with humor but in no way does it overwhelm it. This is a horror film. Bruce Campbell also developes as a performer here. In the first film he seemed more like a nondescript college kid overwhelmed by the horror that engulfs him. Here he comes off as not only a believable action hero but as an adept comedian. His character evolves as the film progresses into a goofy parody of Rambo. Groovy."
1,omg sucked,Bad everything with the exception of what Amazon is responsible for the sound and playback was good so Amazon isn't to blame just badly written and played out
3,EVIL DEAD 2 (HD),IT WAS OKAY. I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING REALLY SCARY ABOUT THE MOVIE. BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT A TIME WASTER
4,"HAIL TO THE KING,BABY!","One of the most hilarious horror films I have ever seen! Full of fun & even has some scary moments here & there. All around, I'd have to say this movie was pretty good & it holds up well to the blu-ray format,although its a little grainy in spots. If your looking for a not-to-serious horror then this is it."
4,hip stuff,nice and smooth groove for late night rendezvous experience... has good continuity... nothing stands out -- not earthshaking -- but definitely fills a worthwhile niche...
2,"Fine, but not what I ordered","I looked closely at the picture and description. I saw 6 contacts, so I ordered. when the product arrived, there were 4 contacts. I returned the product."
4,STEAMY,Perfect book for a Naughty Christmas. My boyfriend and I took turns reading the stories to one another... Led to lots of fun.
2,Not great.,"I bought this book because I had read some fun reviews online. Several sites had talked about how sexy and inventive the stories were, but with the exceptions of one or two, they are all obvious and unsatisfying.Some of the authors didn't seem to know that they were writing sexy stories at all. Others wrote with great detail about sex, but forgot to include characters or any kind of background.I just didn't like most of the stories and I couldn't recommend this book to anyone who really likes to read."
3,Good but....,"I am a huge Elizabeth Taylor fan and I felt that she gave a very good preformance in this film. In fact, I felt that the whole cast was very good. However, I did not care for the ending of the movie and it was sometimes hard to understand Marlon Brando since he was attempting to speak with a southern accent."
5,Reflections on a great movie,"This is one of the deepest, well-made movies I have ever seen. It is the essence of character development. If I were to make a list of movies everyone should see, of Brando films I would rank this #2 behind ""On The Waterfront"" and before ""Last Tango in Paris"" -- Fourth would be ""A Street Car named Desire""."
1,RATED ONE STAR BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,"I don't know because when I received the DVD, it would not play on either of my DVD players or on my computer DVD player, so haven't been able to see the movie. Am still trying to get a copy that will play. It was returned to the seller who credited my account very promptly."
2,"Don't tell anyone, but this movie is really awful.","First off, the golden tint. John Huston is really smart, so this is artistic license. No, not really. It's because the title is ""Reflections in a GOLDEN Eye"". Get it? Golden....Eye. Is this a subtle nuance or was Huston just drunk?Next, Brando's voice. Perhaps the most ridiculous accent or whatever it is I have ever heard. Seriously, if he had spoken with a Donald Duck imitation it would not be less ludicrous.I grew up in the Sixties; I love offbeat Sixties films. But this one is a real stinker."
5,A great buy.,"This Camisole Pyjama set looks and feels great, good value to, I have not given them to my girlfriend yet, they are a present for her, when I join her in NZ in July, i'm sure she is going to love them."
2,Soporific Don Giovanni,"The Marriage of Figaro from this same Aix en Provence festival is a great performanceMozart: Le Nozze di Figaro. This recording of Don Giovanni, with much the same cast, is a severe disappointment.The conducting is relaxed and totally lacking in drama. The Giovanni, Leporello and Masetto are all competent but generic. Teresa Stich-Randall is completely over-parted as Donna Ana and Suzanne Danco also lacks the vocal heft for Elvira. The young Anna Moffo disappoints as Zerlina. Suprisingly, Nicolai Gedda sings an exceptionally good Don Ottavio.The audio is what one would expect for 1955."
3,My ears are raw.,"I will admit the music itself is of good quality and they are an excellent band, but it didn't quite appeal to me. Anarchy in the UK itself is addicting, but not many others hold such 'nicotine'. I gave it a three and my respect for The Sex Pistols in general."
4,emokid12 what????,"Sometime i wish people would learn about a band before they make a fool of themselfs with a review. This cd emokid12 said sounded wierd without a bass player since sid wasnt on the cd. Glen was a great bass player. the pistols started with glen replaced him with sid then took him back when sid tryed to go solo. sid held the pistols back for he was too messed up most times to play. he only played on 7 songs studio recordings that is. sid couldnt learn the songs due to a drug problem. so to me sid was not a real part of the pistols in the music sence, but he was a huge part of them in the crazy in your face bull they gave people. lets face it sid was nuts, and he would have been here still if it wasnt for that piece of junk nancy"
4,straighter toes,"I had ugly, painful bunions, a wierd-shaped 4th toe and no idea how to improve them without surgery. I have only owned the product for 2 days, I have been trying to wear it while working on the computer, watching TV, sleeping and walking around in the house. With the exception of the latter, genki-kun proved to be comfortable and easy to wear and it has already made a visible difference in my crooked toe! As for the bunions, I still have them and I honestly do not feel genki-kun improves the appearance or relieves the pain there - I guess, I just need to give it more time. The suggested excercises are good, but I would not recommend walking with this device - it may move, distort the position of the big toe plus it is really uncomfortable. Otherwise it is very refreshing and invigorating for feet!"
2,disappointed,"At this price, it was disappointing to not be able to use them and get results. They are very rigid, come off easily; have some edges etc.Oh well, did not work for me..."
1,toe stretchers,I cannot get them on my toes. They are not bendable at all. Nobody I have contacted can get them on their toes. Very disappointed. Should have gone with the brand name of yoga toes.
3,Helpful but overpriced,"I just started doing yoga and trying to live healthier. A friend recommended the yoga toes, and since I always have sore feet, I gave them a try. They are painful at first but start to make your feet feel better after a while. (wearing them in a hot bath is the best) My issue is that they are made of FOAM RUBBER, and are already starting to crack a little. They can't cost more than fifty cents to make, yet they cost about $40.00 to buy. A great invention but WAY over-priced."
3,NOT HARD HITTING,"I WAS HOPING TO READ SOME HARD CORE INSIDE INFO ON SOME OF THE HORRORS WE HEAR ABOUT NURSING HOMES AND WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FEEL GOOD PG VERSION OF A SOCIAL WORKER DEALING WITH PATIENTS, RED TAPE AND FAMILIES."
4,A good view at what Joss Stone is about,"This is a very brief single. However if you're intested in exploring what all the buzz about Joss Stone is about and don't want to buy the full album just yet, this is a great buy. Features her grammy nominated track ""You Had Me"", and her interesting take on Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out For A Hero"". At first her version of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" didn't sit well with me, but after listening to it a few times I began to realize this isn't Bonnie Tyler, this is Joss Stone! And she's doing a great interpretation of the song. ""You Had Me"" is amazing, Ms. Stone sure has some powerful pipes on her, best of lucky to her on Grammy night with this track!A great buy"
3,sophomore jinx?,"This is a somewhat disappointing follow-up to Browne's superior first album, and not as good as his third, Late for the Sky. If you don't have those 2, I would start there first. Half the songs on this album are very good to excellent, the other half mediocre at best in my estimation. I love Browne's version of Take It Easy (which he co-wrote), better than the Eagles version in my opinion, and the segue to Our Lady of the Well is nice too. An altogether listenable album, but not his best."
5,one of his best,"not one bad song on this cd , i had this lp when it 1st came out , its great to hear him do take it easy"
2,Got half of what I paid for,I had only recived the first season because that dident have the other in stock. They did however give a full refund. Still dosent chage the star rating.
1,HOLLYWOOD BIOGRAPHIES-THE LEADING MEN,BAD--BAD--BAD-SHOWS A BUNCH OF BAD QUALITY TRAILERS--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING HOLLYWOOD BIOGRAPHIES-THE LEADING LADIES BECAUSE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE LEADING MEN THEN IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF MONEY TWICE--IF IT'S BIOGRAPHIES YOU WANT OF THE STARS THEN PLEASE BUY THE ONES FROM A&E TV--
2,Equally Bad,"This DVD set on the Leading Men, as well as the companion set on Leading Ladies, are done exactly the same, on the cheap. Using public domain footage from movie trailers, old movies and tv shows and some ameatur footage taken of the more recent stars, the quality of this set is poor. This is basically a DVD release of a VHS series of the 1990s called ""Hollywood Remembers,"" and using the exact same footage. Photos, when used in this documentary, are filmed out of books or magazines...very poor quality all around. DO NOT expect A&E type Bios here."
5,One of the best book I ever read,"The story construction is very insteresting: three different stories goes on, but at the end... Adventure, adventure, adventure."
5,Became a fan after watching with my family,I didn't care for the show at all. Just because it seemed too much of a teen show. I started watching after my wife and 3 daughters ask me to watch the show just for a few weeks. It's very entertaining. We now have all 5 seasons on DVD. And proud of it.
5,ANGEL 5 SEXIEST OF ALL,The fifth season of Angel was fab . . the chemistry ofDavid B. with James M. on screen is unbeatable . . thestory line was only surpassed by the perfect acting allaround building up to the final battle scene . . . whichthey left to our imagination . . I guess that means thatlike star trek we could maybe look forward to somecontinuation with movies?? we can only hope!
3,it was okay,"I love angel, and i have wanted the seasons for awhile. I decided to buy them from here and when I got them the packaging was a big beaten up but the disks play so that's okay."
4,Not the Strongest Season,Well worth seeing but not as compelling as earlier seasons when the lines between good and evil were more clearly drawn. A must have for diehard Buffy/Angel fans but a toss-up for the rest of us.
1,Unbelievable disappointing !!!,"Last December 2007 I purchased Angel Season 5 from Amazon. Since yesterday I have been watching this season and today just starting disc 3. What do I find ??? On my TV pops up Arrested Development season 2 which contains the episodes of Switch Hitter, Queen For A Day, Burning Love, Ready, Aim, Marry Mel, Out on A Limb and Hand To God. I check many times the cover on disc and the box. The title is Angel season 5 disc 3 on disc and Angel Season 5 on the box. Nothing's wrong on the cover. But, the inside of disc, who knows ? So, how come it happened ? Is this package actually the rejected product ? I paid for the good product, not the rejected product. Whom has the responsibility to check the product first before release them ? I think there is no guarantee, that spend the money to purchase the good product and you will get it.Now I think I will not continue to disc 4 - 6. Better move to other TV series or movies."
2,season 5 huge let down,now dont get me wrong i am a huge angel fan i loved seasons 1-4 but the fith season sucked every week i watched hopeing it would get better angel and his team took over the evil lawfirm that tried to killed him for the past four years then spike joined the cast that season i dont know why the writers should have left him down in the hellmouth because he served no purpose to the show what so ever i was really upset that cordelia left she was the best cast member an fred turned into a demond that season what the f**k that was just stupit no wonder the show did not have a season six because of the horrible season 5
1,Nope!,"I bought seasons 1-4 because they rocked, I mean I loved them a LOT. But season 5... Why not simply change the name to 'Spike' season 1? Or how about 'Angel & Spike'. This season was made for the Buffy fans, and not true Angel fans, period.Sorely disappointed."
5,Totally Amazing!,By far the best season of Angel. Being a long time lover of Buffy I was very unhappy when it ended. But I was made happy when the 5th season of Angel come out. It picked up where the 7th season of Buffy left off. I literally jumped outta my seat when I saw Spike return. It was exciting to see my fav. buffy character again. Plus Angel and and Spike are reunited and must rekindle their old semi-partnership to battle the forces of evil yet again although they feel great hate for eachother. This is an amazing set and a must have for all Buffy and Angel fans!
5,spike comes in for the big finish!!!!!!!!!!,This is a show that you have to be a psycho fan ofotherwise you will not enjoy itBuffy rules and was one of my favs !Spike is the hottest best thing ever and i never go for blonds !It was a great idea to put him on the show but alas it wasover sigh.....loved wes and fred and everyone on the show was greati will mis you angel:)
5,Loved!,Will definitely watch again and again! I LOVED season five and now I own it. It came quickly too!
5,leaves you hungry for more,"This was the reason I bought all five seasons of Angel on DVD. I caught season five when it was originally broadcast and realized I needed to see the entire series. It's great TV with that Joss Wheadon touch that makes it that much better.Even though it was a spinoff, Angel stands on it's own and has a different voice than Buffy. The characters are engaging, the plots are interesting and the writing is excellent. My only regret? It ended too soon.Buy all five seasons. They're worth every penny."
3,finale review,"in my opinion Angel was a lot more interesting than the buffy series, i watched angel religiously and enjoyed every episode. It was sad to see it end, i wished the finale would have had a bit more closure but all in all, very entertaining."
5,great show,this is a great show! a must see. final season of Angel a dark drama/comedy about a vampire and his gang out to save the world.
4,FuNNY FUNNY FUNNY,"With Spike in the new mix of Angel and the gang working at WolfRanm & Hart the show is extreamly hilarious. I never really liked seasons 2-4 of Angel, they got too depressing, but i watched them for the humor. Now, most of this season is a lot like season 1. It has a short little story every episode with a continuing story throughout. I love it....Although maybe the reason I enjoy it somuch is that Spike is back, oh well. Its as funny as hell.If you get this item and love it, get all of the season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. They are twice as funny, the last few seasons are the best though. I love the Musical."
3,ANGEL SEASON 5,this DVD set is great although it did say it was in good condition and if i remember right it said very good condition? it jumps on my favorite episode :(
4,Angel-Season Five,"The fifth season of Angel played out to a great finale. The recall of characters from previous seasons made for a satisfying tying up of loose ends. I used to watch the series when it was on TV, but missed the entire final season and was excited to finally get to see it. So many episodes left me laughing, stunned and crying within the same 50 minutes. This was the best season following the first season of Angel."
5,Classic Dance Pop!,"This track is a stunning example of fresh dance pop sounds recorded last year in Melbourne, Australia/ Madison Avenue is the brainchild of local DJ and producer Andy Van, with vocals on this track by CHeyne Coates, who intially only put down the vocal track as a guide for the intented singer. The results, however, were so cool that they ran with her vocal. Like ""Groove Is In The Heart"" in the 80s, ""Don't Call Me Baby"" is surely one of the defining crossover tracks of the 90s."
1,tdkrn,Pretty Flatware if you like very heavy flatware. The soup spoons and forks are hard to handle. The picture is a little deceiving not as bright and sparkling as I thought they would be. I wouldn't buy again.
2,Same as the pocket shirt,"These are the exact same shirts except with no pocket.The rave reviews are not warranted, as the material is a lotthinner than it used to be. See the reviews on the pocketed T.They are not as kind as these.I think the difference may be that those that like no pocket usethe T shirt for lounging, and not working.If you are going to use a T shirt for working in, you usually wanta pocket to carry notes/keys/parts, etc. and you want the T shirtthick."
2,Not worth it,The picture is an exaggeration. You get a skinny stalk of bamboo. The unit comes disassembled..you have to set it up.I have seen better specimens for half the price at the grocery store.
2,The price is a joke,"At a lot of asian grocery stores they sell bamboo alone for really cheap. Bamboo is like the 2nd fastest growing plant in the world (next to seaweed). Its better to see these things in person before buying anyways. Size and shape vary, and packaging tend to be harsh on plants"
2,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"First off the system installs very easy ....BUT!! in my oppinion compared to other units the screens are horrible. and the information stinksAnd now my system keeps telling me that the maps are corrupt . So i went online with Pyle tech support and they came the conclusion that my disk was bad . Now no one will answer my calls, my emails , to get a replacement .. Their support lacks alot...."
3,"It works but,...","Setting up the software is a nightmare, but once it is working - it works, for the most part.Pros:* No monthly fee's for GPS - it's all free.* Alternative to CAR PC system (Windows CE-based SOC)Cons:* From time to time, the GPS software gets lost. Probably due to the provided map information being outdated. It will update errors in the map with the corrections. These updates are not permanent, which is annoying.* Remote would have benefited with a phone-format key input for text and numbers instead of directional keys - which seem clunky and slow."
5,A Trippy Album,"This album is one of the most creative I ever listened too. Though Quasimoto's flow is rather ho-hum, his strange, high pitched voice and fun lyrics make up for it. The alter-ego of Madlib, Quasimoto doesn't loose any of his crate-digging skills, making the most haunting beats to be heard on a hip-hop record in a while. Most song are under 3 minutes so those who are into long epics should stay away, but if you want something that says 'What is this?' then this album is for you."
1,I'm sorry but....,"I thought this cd was garbage. He might produce hot beats and write good lyrics but I couldn't get past the voice. It seriously sounded like he made the entire album after he took a balloon and sucked in some helium. Kind of reminded me of Alvin and the Chimpmunks. I read all the great reviews on Amazon and as much as I wanted to like this album, as soon as I heard it I was seriously thinking about throwing it out the window."
4,Genius.,"Real hip hop, stripped of it's obsession with lyrical complexity.If you're gonna buy this album, you'd be a fool not to get the deluxe version because Madlib is after all, a DJ 1st, producer 2nd, MC 3rd.Best track's are probably Come On Feet and Good Morning SunshineUnseen (Dlx)Peace!"
3,Simple Working Radio,"We use these as BINGO prizes at a young adult center,and they love them. They work exactly as advertised for a really good price."
1,I do not recommend purchasing this product,"It is a piece of crap. I can't believe I bought it. The reception is terrible, and it's almost impossible to find any radio stations. Probably will have to throw it away as shipping to amazon would cost the same as the radio."
4,"Basically, a good product","I was looking for a mini FM radio product and this fills that bill. Because it is mini, I found it a bit difficult to find the feequency I required. However, once it was set, it was fine. Clarity is very good, volume is very good, portability (hung around my neck) was excellent. The only negatives I experienced were that the cords are too long. That's quite minor and I am quite satisfied with the Cody."
5,more than I expected,This little radio is more than I expected for the price. It has fantastic reception and sound quality. I am very pleased with this Coby radio.
1,Save your money,I had very low standards for this product and it managed to come in well under all of them. Biggest problem is the tuner. You get stations on top of other stations. Save your money and buy a better unit.
3,It works,"This radio works great as long as you don't change channels often. It is not digital, so you have to fine tune the stations. It's super tiny, which is awesome. The neck strap that it comes with broke as soon as I had it out of the packaging. So, I hope you have some string if you want to put it around your neck."
2,"Coby CX70BLK Mini Pocket AM/FM Radio, Black","I got this product to listen to the radio while running, but it did not meet expectations. Unfortunately, the tuner is very sensitive and switches stations when moved. I tried taping the dial, and it works, but I wish the radio had a hold/lock button.The other problem is that where I live, it only picks up one station in FM, and 1 in AM. This could be just because of where I live, thus the 2 stars.I can not recommend this product, but given the price, I guess it may be worth it if just listening to the radio in the office or something like that."
1,cherap,I bought this radio to use when walking. It only last a week brfore the hole the ear bugs plug into got a short I was very disappointed.Guess you get what you pay for..
1,DOA,This radio arrived DOA. While it was getting power I could get no sound with 3 pairs of earbuds. I've had problems with COBY products before and cannot recommend them at any price.
1,Wont tune in anything but the strongest stations,Very unprescisce tuning makes this radio pretty much worthless unless you want to listen to just a few of the highest wattage stations on the dial. Don't waste your money.
3,Coby CX70BX Pocket Radio,"Like everything about the radio, The compactness. The only problem is the volume control is sensitive on the low end. Other then that it's a great little radio for what I using it for. The reason I got the radio is because I can't get am station on my iPod Nano. Only FM."
2,doctorve,"This is a small Stereo FM receiver with decent sound. I really don't mind the tuning dial because once set it holds on station pretty well. The problem I have is that it isn't a very good receiver, with lots of static that is positional. I bought it to use with headphones while cutting my somewhat large yard. It doesn't perform as well as some others I have used, eg; Sony Walkman. Even though it is very cheap, it may not be worth it."
1,The most Crap ive ever purchased,This is by far the most terrible 'radio' I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.These marketers should be charged with GROSS Fraud.Do not waste your money on this
2,You get wat you pay for,"I like the case size and the concept, but the channel number is very small and hard to ""read"" also experiencing channel drifts and channel overlap."
3,mini pocket radio,The radio is ok for what it is. The reception is not very good and always has static. I like it because it is small and portable and gets an AM signal.
3,almost good enough,"The little radio serves the purpose I bought if for, the reception and sound quality is good, but I really wish I had spent the few extra dollars to get the digital tuner. My 50+ year old eyes have a great deal of difficulty seeing the numbers on the tuner dial, and it can be a challenge to get the proper station."
4,"good radio, great price","It's a portable radio for about 10 bucks. It works, sound quality is good. Durability and battery life are great (2 AAAs). Only criticism is the volume dial is stiff to adjust. Not a big problem. If you want a decent radio for cheap, this is your product."
2,Just what u can get with the price,"I got it for just $10 so you can't expect more from it. The head phone was pathetic and cheap. with the provided head phone i was not able to get a good sound then I used my BOSE headphn. The signal is not strong, In louisville even near the FM station building I was not able to get strong and clear sound...lolbattery cosmume is average.around 13-15 hours play with 2 pcs full charged duracell."
3,coby radio,The frequency dial is hard to read otherwise it fits my needs. The price is good. Thank you for your consideration.
3,Good for walking and hanging out.,"This is good for using while I walk, but not much else. I tried wearing it when I was working in the yard and the neck cord and earphone cords kept getting in the way. The volume control is hard to get adjust to just the right volume and the tuning wheel is about the same. For the price it will do the job."
1,Horrible product,I have ordered 2 players in past 4 days and neither works at all. I had to return both because they would not operate. Maybe they received a bad batch of players from wherever they are made?? Needless to say I'm not ordering a third one.
4,Bimwili and the Zimwi,"This was a great find since I couldn't find the book at Barnes and Noble, but it was described as new and clearly was not, but is in pretty good shape."
5,best book ever,"This was my favorite book as a child. I remember checking it out nonstop from the library in elementary school. My mother bought me my own copy when I was in high school, and now I'm able to share it with my son. He loves it. He especially loves the ""sound effects"" and the song that we made up our own tune for. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anybody."
4,Just my thoughts,When I heard this one back in 1976[which happens to be my favorite of the seventies! I was 14 and just starting to get into music. I loved Pretender. Especially Hear comes those tears again! I just now read Bonnie Raitt is doing harmony vocals on that. Jackson And Bonnie are great singing together!
3,more poetry than music,"I'd only heard Jackson Brown's hits before this, and I like those alot. i hadn't reaized that many of his songs have what I would call minimal music, with the main thrust being in the lyrics. That's a whole genre whichpersonally I don't care for. I found the same problem when I got a Don McLean album. So be advised that alot of these songs don't ""rock"" musically like his hits do, even though the lyrics may have alot to say."
5,An under - appreciated masterworks,"This is an extraordinary album. Huge feeling and powerfully melodic. I agree with another reviewer, Your Bright Baby Blues, Here Come Those Tears Again, Daddy's Tune, and Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate are masterworks. When I listen to Jackson's work, and particularly this album, I sometimes wonder why he is not lauded as one of the most significant singer, songwriters and is relatively low profile. (The same could be said of Neil Finn formerly of Crowded House). I personally feel there is daylight between Jackson's work and most of the rest. An under-appreciated masterworks."
5,Birth of my love of music,"An album that has truly stood the test of time. I was a teenager when this album came out. I was barely out of my candy rock stage of the Partridges and Donny Osmond. This album with it's insight and poetry birthed a new appreciation for this type of music. I couldn't call it rock, I couldn't call it folk, and I certainally couldn't call it pop or country...It was Jackson Browne and to this day I rush to the records (oops I mean CD)stores when I hear he has something new out."
5,Masterpiece Written under the worst of times for Browne,"His wife kills herself leaving him a son. Not exactly material for an uplifting album in an era (1976) that is right of the beginning of the disco generation.Instead, Brown pores his sorrow into a masterpiece. Those of who listened to Browne in high school and are now middle age Grandparents (like myself) hark back to the song the Pretender everyday as a description of our lives. Here Come Those Tears again was his point in life and a great song. The Fuse, which often gets overlooked these days, is a great combination of haunting music and Browne wanting to make a statement on the state of the world at that time. I happened to see the first night of the Pretender Tour in Cincinnati and the audience was confused by the Fuse at first listen. A few months later in Lexington, it was one of the favorites. It is a sound that grows on you.If you have an IQ above triple digits and the ability to be intropective, buy this album. ..."
5,awesome and revealing!,"this story was very intriguing. i am too young to have lived through the 70's where drugs were the ""thing"". but i got a great opinion of a girl who was a ""good"" girl and she learned to cope with people that were very different. i felt her sorrow and joy. this is the 2st book by katia spiegelman that i have read, but this first impression really did give me that extra push!"
5,High quality good value,"Gets the job done. High quality, good value cable. No complaints about the delivery or the quality of the product."
5,"Emilio Santiago is the ""Golden Voice""","Wow!!! This is another fascinating success in Emilio's long career, and this one is totally in almost-perfect Spanish (with two Bonus tracks in Portuguese : Minha Namorada by (Carlitos Lyra) and Anos Dourados by (Antonio Carlos Jobim, Chico Buarque).His golden voice soares throughout the album, making this a very enjoyable one. Not a single weak song.Finally, is important to mention that:Luiz Avellar / plays the keyboards and makes the arrangementsRoberto Menescal / plays the guitars and produces the albumand his sonMarcio Menescal(BossaCucaNova member)recorded and mixed the album.Very recommendable for all Emilio Santiago fans !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Can't get enough of Elmo's World.,"My 20 month old son cannot get enough of Elmo. Nothing else on T.V. holds his attention, not even Sesame Street until, of course, Elmo's World turns on. He has watched this DVD a few dozen times and does not get sick of it. I am sick of it though so I will buy him a couple more Elmo's World DVD's!"
3,Would be better if these weren't constanly on SS,"These are good, cute little Elmo's World. My daughter likes them but... I think if I saw that ""singing"" Elmo's world one more time I'd lose it! It seems that the shorts in this DVD are frequently used in the episodes of Sesame Street that air on TV/on Demand, especially the singing one."
4,Serrie is the Master,"There are few things I like more than being under a star-filled sky with my telescope while listening to John Serrie. Any John Serrie. Even after a really stressful day at work, Serrie's music is great for winding down. This was one of the first CD's of his that I bought. However, I just downloaded the MP3 album for my iPod."
4,Chill for the space traveler,"I suppose this falls into the category of ""space music"", and that would be accurate. It's dreamlike, without being flat. With a little imagination, you might feel like you're somewhere else...I had purchased this back in '92 or '93, and have listened to it consistently since. I find that I am immediately soothed from the opening 'Gentle, the Night'. This CD has become a familiar soundtrack to my workday and my late evenings. I also recommend ""Century Seasons"", a sort of 'best-of'."
5,Probably Mr. Serrie's Best Work......,"A space-essential. ""Stars"" is right up there with both ""Planetary Chronicles"" works and is before his switch to a different sound in later works like ""Tingri"". Absolutely fabulous to listen to when driving home from a night shift or sitting out on your deck on a warm night. Put this together with Meg Bowles' ""Blue Cosmos"", and you've got a space all-star back-to-back combo."
5,This particular music is timeless,"Jonn Serrie's ""And The Stars Go With You"" is music that is timeless. I have been listening to this CD now for four years and it has so much sensory appeal that it never seems to get old. It is great for those want to lose themselves in the night sky - headphones, a blanket on the ground and Jonn Serrie in the background - what a combination!"
5,My #1 Recommendation for Meditation Or Celestial Gazing,"Whether you love star gazing or meditation, this will take you on a journey to the stars. I teach meditation and love playing this CD. I have more people asking who he is and the name of this CD. Some of the pieces are as much as 10 minutes or longer. Or if you love star gazing, set this CD in motion or ""Flightpath"", another one of his best CD's. Enjoy the journey!"
5,FANTASTIC!,"I never knew one could purchase such great music. I first bought this as a cassette and then the cd. It is the BEST cd I own. Whenever I listen to it I feel like I am in the ocean, not space. All the songs just fit perfectly with sea creatures swimming by and bubbles going up. Just great to go to sleep by."
5,Great kitchen essential,"Love the sleek look, and the handle hole that makes it great for hanging from a pot rack and freeing up space in the kitchen drawers."
4,Great Arts and Crafts Book,I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter who loves anything involving paper and a glue stick. It contains very colorful and creative ideas. The best part about it is that the finished products actually look like real kid art.
3,Very short book,"This is a nice book, thin and in paperback. The only reason it didn't get a higher rating is that it is included in it's entirity in the Big Book of Playtime Activities, along with every other in the series. For less than twice the price of a small book."
3,too girly,"This book has a couple cute projects, but overall it is just okay.There seem to be a lot of projects geared towards girls. I would not recommend for a boy."
4,Huh,"I read this book, super excited because I, like the character, had moved with my parents from Seattle, WA to England. My experience was completely different than hers.Anyways, it was a very entertaining read. Not very realistic, but entertaining."
3,3 stars for the cute factor,"Didn't love it, didn't hate it: this foray into teen fiction left me feeling neutral. The dialogue (real and e-mailed) gets bogged down with way too much slang; some passages, such as the copied-and-pasted IM, were completely irrelevant. The heroine is the typical 16-year-old in that she is self-absorbed and fairly vain, but NOT without redeeming qualities: by the end of the book, she figures out her dad is not totally without merit, and realizes the error of her ways regarding the guy she had her hopes set on.After reading this, however, a palate-cleansing is in order."
2,wait was it supposed it to be funny?,"Ok this book was NOT good. Maybe if you are 12 it might be good. I dont know. It was not funny. The writing was a complete rip-off of Louise Rennison's style. If you want to read a funny british-type comedy story read ""angus, thongs and full frontal snogging."" If you want to read 'loo' make sure you borrow it. DONT make the mistake of buying it."
4,"This product is very """"dependable"""". The overnight protection ...","This product is very """"dependable"""". The overnight protection is great. They didn't leak and were reliable for overnight protection. I like the tabs for easy opening and closing. I would recommend these to anyone."
1,not size expected.,"I can wear the small/medium size I buy at super market, but not these; they are too small."
1,As absorbent as a paper towel,Just not a quality product for incontinence. You'd be better off searching Amazon for Abri-Form or Molicare.
2,Not so hot,"I tried depends for bed wetting, and the were unfortunately no help. The leaked often, and thus I was faced with wet sheets. Attends seems to be a better brief, they don't leak as much."
4,Wearever,"I really like the pots and pans, however there were two that came with dents on the rim. I'm not sure if they came from the manufacturer that way, or if dented in shipment to me. I sent them back to Wearever for replacements, but it was a hassle."
2,Very unhappy with product .,Handles are not stay cool as stated on box at least I didn't think so. I tried 3 different lids and had to use potholder with all. Very dissapointed with product.
3,The Destoyer is a good series...but,"I am a Destroyer fan from way back. I used to buy the paperbacks when they first were published. Gave them away so this Amazon series is great for me. This particular book though I didn't enjoy as much due to the language, even though I know the time frame it was written. Being a Black American,veteran guides my point of view. Still a great series, just be prepared for some archaic and maybe even offensive points of view painted by the authors. Thanks anyway Amazon for bringing the Destoryer back! I plan to keep on reading as the price is within the budget (0.99 - 1.99 good more gives me reason to have to choose)"
