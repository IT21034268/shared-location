2,Nothing new here.,"This is a very narrow topic. By definition these are gardens that are very limited in size and scope. Having said that, i was still very disappointed in this book. It doesn't take much shopping around, thumbing through other books and checking the Internet to find dozens of good ideas for tabletop gardens. And any garden writer worth her (or his) salt can come up with ""how to do it"" and ""plants to choose"" text to make the ideas a practicality. So why the paucity of ideas? Why are we treated, on pages 52 and 53, to a two-page close-up of gravel?Don't waste any time on this very ordinary book about ordinary plants in ordinary containers."
4,not acid jazz but still funky,"The other reviews are correct when they say that this is not an acid jazz disc, but if you are like me and dont care at all about music labels such as Jazz, rock, blues,soul,classical or whatever. You just enjoy good music that makes you groove regardless of the so call genre then this is the disc for you."
2,Agree with the rest...,"MoS can be good, or it can be not so good. This compilation is not-so-good. Not-so-acid jazz, not-so-well-mixed. Keep looking..."
1,A Total Ripoff,"One of the worst films of this type I have ever seen. Definitely a cut and paste of cutting room floor junk, stitched together and falsely advertized to appeal to those of us who enjoy this category of film. Promises, but delivers .... nothing. It should be illegal to sell such a worthless product. And the tape quality itself was trash. The only good scene in the whole film featured Felica, and for her scene the tape was defective for the last half of the scene and it presented like a scrambled cable channel!! What a waste of time and money. Save yours and don't buy this ripoff."
4,Good Book for a Light Read,"This was a good book for some light reading. Nothing deep, but good backstories for some of Paul Overstreet's best songs. The included Video CD (plays in any DVD player) had some great material on it too. I ended up re-selling the book after I read it, but for a die-hard fan it would be a keeper. I miss Paul... he had some great songs. Hopefully he'll come back to the musical scene someday. He could do some great duets with someone like Randy Travis. (Hint, hint, Paul... are you listening?)"
5,Forever and Ever Amen,"I am anticipating a 5 as I love Paul Overstreet, haven't had a chance to read it yet .He is a real inspiration"
4,"Great product, but a little noisey","I too was given this pump by a lactation nurse, I pump at night after my baby goes to sleep. I think the pump is Great! It does what I need it to do and it very comfortable. The only drawback is that is is kind of loud. I would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally."
1,WASTE OF TIME,LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED.
1,Didn't work for me.,"I got this pump at the hospital and it just didn't work for me. I only got a few drops with it. I know everyone's different and it probably works for some people, but I just couldn't make it work. Maybe if someone has an overabundance of milk to express, it would work a bit better. The Avent Isis worked great for me, though."
1,Not convenient or useful!,"Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial. It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth. Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing. I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing.This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model. Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap!"
3,BPO 2nd edition review,"The book is quite interesting in matter of setting an initial framework for BPO contracts, provisions and so forth. However I do think that it lacks a little in depth in matters of theoretical BPO foundation and/or importance. Every piece of information within the book is not quite up to date, which means it has content from 2005 and backwards, no recent developments ins regard to the topic exist."
3,Wigwam - 'Lucky Golden Stripe & Starpose' (Love Records),"Originally released in 1976,as this was Wigwam's seventh record.Glad that I didn't have to spent that much ca$h when I bought this title,but it was the only Wigwam CD the dealer had in stock at the time.I was recommended to check out some of the band's material from a friend.All he told me was they were a Finnish band with a British vocalist,and that they are.I need to get ahold of some of their earlier recordings.Although 'Lucky Golden...' is decent '70's progressive,it didn't do all that much for me.I'll be fair by mentioning this CD did have a few surprises.Better tracks would be ""Colossus"",the title cut ""Lucky Golden Stripe&Starpose"",""Never Turn You In"" and ""Wardance"".Line-up:Jim Penbroke-piano&vocals,Pekka Rechardt-guitar,Mosse Groundstroem-bass,Hessu Hietanen-keyboards and Ronnie Osterburg-drums.Might possibly appeal to fans of Hatfield&The North,Camel,Colosseum,The Strawbs and Gentle Giant."
3,"Ok for $45, but not retail","Its a typical Kensington product. Good idea, bad execution.The frame piece is great, and really sturdy (all steel). It is identical to all other sliding, articulating trays (I think this piece was made by another manufacturer). Then Kensington slapped a $5 plastic tray on to the frame and called it quits. It is cheap, ugly blue, and all the plastic trim pieces fall off.If the price is listed more than $50, dont bother. Otherwise, its worth the money just for the sturdy sub-frame.One other thing, the included mousepad is totally worthless and shouldn't have ever been put in the package."
1,Broke in 2 months,"I had this thing for about 2 months. One night I heard a crash in the living room and yes, my Klipsch center speaker crashed behind my HDTV damaging the speaker and wall. Fortunately damage to speaker was cosmetic. This thing is NOT to be used with a speaker over 20 lbs. Like others here I do not recommend this stand....too risky. Like everything else you get what you pay for."
4,Nice!,It's a well-built unit & it fits great on top of my TV. I have 2 minor gripes:1. The instructions were not great & I had to figure out part of the assembly on my own. 2. The front edge of the shelf has a raised lip that obscured the lights on my black Series 2 Tivo.
3,Good idea if it fit any modern flatscreen,"I read some reviews about how this required a deeper display, but I ignored them because product description read 'fits on all modern displays' at the time of purchase. Looks like it has been updated now to reflect that it does not. If you have any flat panel display TV, it will not work, no matter how you set it up. For deeper TVs, it seems like a great idea. The front pegs definitely stand out (shiny) which may detract from your TV's look, and the rear supports use tape (which seems like it will eventually fail). The idea could be cool if you have an old TV, but if you don't you'll have to return it like me."
1,Junk,This speaker shelf is either 1. missing parts or 2. provides parts that don't work properly with it. probably a trip to Lowe's and a hack saw can 'make it work' but basically its junk and I am sorry i bought it. waste of $30 and its too much hassle to return.
3,"Good Idea, mediocre implementation","I'm not a big fan of this shelf. It uses double sided tape to hold itself to the back of your TV. Also, if you have a newer, shallower Projection TV, it may not have long enough legs for the back. Also, the pegs used to hold it to the front of the TV are huge. They protrude into the viewing area on my TV. One reviewer suggested flipping it over, but I don't think we should have to figure out a way to make this work. I think the manufacturer should have done a better job engineering it. In Summary, it'll work if you're not too picky. If I could do it over, I would have went with a different solution though."
2,piece of crap!!,"this is absolutely not made for today's slim tv's; lcd or plasma!! i didn't read the reviews before purchasing & since i'm too lazy to send it back, i made it work. the shelf is perforated so can put one of the screws thru the 8th hole from the end & attach an extended leg with a sticky pad & it held my 11# center speaker. wouldn't have bought this if i'd not been in such a hurry the other day, shipping was uber fast tho but doesn't make up for a lame product!"
3,2nd in the house,"I previously had bought a silver model of this item in 2003 from my then employer Circuit City, it worked great & I loved it. Well this year we bought a new TV (black) & decided to get a matching mount for the top as the silver looked funny. So when this 1 arrived I promptly put it together & found out that the main piece of steel was warped (had to have the support legs different legnths to fix) & what is worse is that the 2 front pegs that grab the top of the TV are silver, not black & it looks horrid. The picture on the website clearly shows this item as all black."
5,GREAT!!!,Great product. Works perfectly. I would recommend!!!I have my center channelo in the front with enough rom behind it to put my wireless router.
3,Does what it's supposed to but caused image distortion.,Bought and mounted this (8 lb speaker) on our 73 inch Mitsubishi DLP. It is a high quality stand but I noticed that the weight on the back of our tv caused the image in the middle to bow downwards. It wasn't extremely noticeable but just enough to make me concerned about the long term effects. I decided to make and mount a shelf behind the tv on the wall. Unfortunately removing the Omnimount's sticky pads with the shelf stuck to it was a chore in itself. May work better for tv's with a more solid back or one that is not quite so steep as ours.
4,Super product but not for LCD/LED,"This product would not fit my Vizio 55 inch LCD but I have a Bello stand for LCDs so I mounted it and used adhesive to stick on top of the Bello stand, otherwise it would not have fit. In any event it works but it really is designed for DLPs and older CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) type TVs.This mount is sturdy just like other OmniMount products."
4,"Does the job, but...","First I tried to install the OmniMount speaker shelf by following the instructions. The posts on the front that keep it from sliding backwards protruded into the viewable part of the screen of my Samsung 61"" DLP. This was not going to work so then I tried installing the shelf upside down as suggested by other reviewers. This works fine. The shelf is very stable."
2,good quality but didn't work on my plasma,"i've got a 42"" plasma and this wouldn't accomodate the sleek back. was hoping for more flexibility."
4,Not For All Flat Screens,"This item is exactly as described and adds a platform to the top of your TV for DVD players, cable boxes, etc. Simple, nice design. Only drawback is it will not work with thin flat screens. You need at at least a 4"" width to support the legs."
4,Omnimount Center Channel Speaker - Worth it,"I have a Samsung 61"" DLP (HL61A750) and needed a place to store my 20lb Polk Audio center channel. This stand is great. Sturdy and attractive when mounted according to other reviewers on this board. I installed upside down as suggested and the shelf looks great. It gets 4 stars because the instructions were difficult to understand so throw em out. Don't panic if you see something in the instructions that didn't come out of the box. Most of the parts are (for some reason) already attached to each other even though they appear separate in the installation guide.Bottom line: If you have a product that is under the weight limit of this shelf and you do not want to drill through your wall, get this item."
3,"So far, so good...","I have a Sharp 37"" LCD and it is very thin. I was going to ship the stand back because the legs were about 5 inches from the TV. My wife suggested moving the legs forward a few holes. So far it looks and seems fine. I have about a 10lb speaker on it as well as an HD Cable receiver. If they crash, I will lose a lot of money and possibly damage the TV. I will see how it lasts for about a month, and if it works I will probably buy another.UPDATE 10/24/08: So far this little stand has withstood the test of time and I would recommend it to my friends and family."
4,Great for narrow televisions,"I have a Sony 60"" 1080p 120Hz Rear-Projection SXRD HDTV-KDS-60A3000 and this allows me to mount a 35# center speaker on top of it. Don't know what I'll do when I buy my next TV since they keep getting thinner. If you put them under the TV, the sound get partially blocked by your feet if you sit back in your chair or if you have a coffee table or some such between you and the TV. For now, this well-built shelf does the trick."
3,Question ONLY,"Before I purchase this shelf I have a question that needs to be answered before I go ahead. How far do the legs of the shelf extend as I am looking for the legs to extend approx 6.5 to 7"" to fit to my Sony TV. Can someone advise me. Thanking you in advance for this advice."
5,exactly what i needed,"Lightweight, sturdy, easy to install - just what I wanted to hold my Tivo on top of my Sony TV. I've had this for a couple of years and it's been great."
4,gets the job done,"This is a product that works. I did flip it over to use, as others have. If you use it the ""correct"" way, you have two large metal rods that drop down over the front of your TV screen that looks bad AND can damage your screen (stupid design), they are just too big. However, by flipping it over and using the small front lip effectively does the same thing as using it right side up with the 2 metal rods dropping down. The two rear feet that are adhered to the back of the set grip very well. Two things though, #1 - Don't go over the weight limit of the shelf! my center channel is 17 lbs and the capacity is 30. #2, position the speaker as far forward as possible distributing the weight towards the front."
3,Worked great... at first.,"I did like this product when I first purchased it 9 months ago and I do have to admit it worked great for the first 6 months. I used it mostly for a couple of older model Sony digital camcorders with batteries NP-QM91D and NP-F960. The Sony adapter plates have two metal prongs on it which began to get flimsy and bend. The prongs aren't broken yet, but they really didn't get a chance to because the charger just quit charging before that happened. I thought maybe the Sony plate was the problem, but I also tried to charge a JVC battery (which has flat metal contactors, not prongs) and it wouldn't charge either. I use my camcorders frequently and have several extra batteries so the charger did get used a lot. I would not purchase this model again, but I guess I can't complain too much because it was only $30."
4,A VERY quick charger,"I like the variety of plates that it comes with to give it the ability to charge many different brands and sizes of batteries. The plates are sometimes a bit tricky to get on exactly, but not enough to be a bother."
3,Faux Flame Light,"This is OK when it works, but the flame fabric is too heavy the amount of air the fan puts out. This makes the flame collapse on itself and often it does not recover without a little outside intervention. Visually it is realistic enough from 10' away or more, but not up close & the fan is very loud (especially for the size) and ruins the effect. I would not recommend this item & I am considering returning it."
1,did not work as advertised - returned,I tried this on cigarette odor and cat smell AFTER a deep cleaning. I was not impressed so I gave it another round of generous spraying. It still did not perform as expected. I returned the product and they did refund my purchase price
5,It Works!,This is the only product of its kind that I have purchased that actually works - removing the odor. You have to saturate the area and then let dry but this is the only product I will continue to buy to get rid of pet (cat) urine odor.
5,Billy Boy Gets A London Session!,"Billy Boy Arnold is another of those highly gifted musicians that receive little attention in the States. So, after three exceptional releases with Alligator records, Arnold packed up and went to the UK. In typical UK fashion, and like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker before him, Arnold was greeted and then treated to a ""London Session"", a recording session backed by a well seasoned band of group of musicians. On this disc, the legendary blues band, Tony McPhee and the Groundhogs, backs Arnold for 18 tracks and 72 minutes of solid blues. On the disc, there are plenty of soulful vocals and powerful harp riffs that are somewhat reminiscent of Muddy Waters and Little Walter. A real classic not to be missed by blues lovers."
4,Sentimental choice,"After seeing this version televised, and hearing the affecting childrens' voices ballasted by the men, I went out and bought the tape. This was years ago. Now the sound is clanky and rough compared to recent performances, but still charmingly real. And for 95, how can you go seriously wrong?"
4,Not the original but still sounds alright,"This is a good Halloween CD to buy if you want to pinch pennies. It has 12 of the best instrumental horror themes, but it's NOT the original performers. You won't be dissappointed. The Tracks are:1. Halloween2. Friday The 13th3. The Exorsist4. JAWS5. Psycho6. The Omen7. Silence of the Lambs8. Scream9. The X-Files10. A Nightmare on Elm Street11. Dracula12. The Shining"
3,"Classical, instrumental interpretations are a bit dreary","For the beginner, I recommend the ""Forever Tango"" soundtrack CD. This CD is okay if you like a classical interpretation without the lyrics. I found this CD somewhat ""rainy-day"" dreary. It is not easy to dance to this music, because the beat is not steady. The music does not fit the title, either. It is a European CD, not from Argentina."
3,Wish it were more durable....,"Great castle, nice detail (drawbridge, turrets). It's main asset - the ability to have different configurations, is also it's biggest problem - the wooden dowel connectors break off if you're not careful.Still a toy that sees consistent play, and probably one that will even make it to our grand kids."
3,Not for Q1 Ultras!,ATTENTION: This organizer is not for the Q1 Ultra as the title indicates. It is for the Q1 early series. Do not purchase this product if you have a Q1 Ultra UMPC.
3,not for q1 ultra,i know it says q1 only but thought i should mention this will not fit the q1 ultra. had to return.
3,Obsolete product,"For one of the early touch-screen portables. The ""organizer"" case was needed to protect the exposed touch-screen from damage. The computer itself was badly underpowered with Vista with 1 GB and no way to upgrade memory. The Net Books have essentially obsoleted this product for ease of travel."
3,Healthful but Horrible Taste,"The marketing of Power4 reveals a very healthful juice, but you have to dilute it with grape or another juice, as its taste is very challenging. I have to admit it's wild, but I wouldn't order a second bottle."
1,Power 4,"Power 4 is by far the worst tasting thing I have ever put in my mouth. I'm not sure about the good that it does, but it's so bad that it's hard to drink and I've tried everything."
3,Good Book for Yellow Belts,"If you are a collection freak of Rath n Strong books, i can only tell you is that buy only the advance tools on Six Sigma book and the book on Lean. This is just basic stuff that you can learn anywhere, if you are a Yellow Belt or you want to give something handy for your project team, please do purchase this, but if you really want to learn the real thing, by something like Thomas Pyzdeks Black Belts hand book, which is super!"
5,How it all began . . .,"I have been a fan of THE GREAT ONE for a good while now, but it was only recently that I discovered this debut Joni Mitchell album. I had not heard much about it so I expected a good effort, nothing more. How wrong I was. Every last track (even the esoteric and odd Pirate of Penance) weaves a beautiful tale that sounds heavenly in Joni's pure performance. My favorites are ""Song to a Seagull"", ""The Dawntreader"", ""Nathan LaFreneer"", ""Cactus Tree"" and ""I Had a King"". Though this album predates me by more than a decade (I am a child of the eighties, no less), there is nothing I cannot relate to on it. There is a purity to it which I have never encountered on any other musical venture: no synthetic chords, no vocal enhancements, no audio engineering. Just one's woman's voice and her guitar. Incredible."
2,Beautiful Songs But Poorly Recorded,As a Joni Mitchell fan I appreciated the assortment of beautiful songs. The audio quality however is one of the worst I have ever heard for vocals. Joni's voice is sometimes barely audible and then so loud it is shrill. It never shimmers and is quite dull sounding throughout. The audio engineers were out to lunch when this album was recorded. Audiophiles should shun this recording.
3,Pretty good starter,"One of the most flat-out gorgeous I've ever heard, with a ton of overdubbed vocals (""Night in the City"") and beautifully strummed acoustic guitars. The lyrics are fantastic, too, either meditations on lost love (""I Had a King""), full-tilt philosophy (""Cactus Tree""), or portraits (""Nathan La Freener""; ""Michael from Mountains""). And Joni's complex acoustic guitar on ""The Dawntreader"" earns it some pretty high praise from me - same for the complex vocal overlaying on ""The Pirate Penance"". The big problem with this (and Clouds, for that matter), is that there are few melodies that really stick with me, which means a lot of the material wanders to pointlessness, particularly the longer songs (""Marcie""; ""Sisotowbell Lane""; title song). And when she tries to break the acoustic-guitar-and-vocals formula, it's hit or miss: she nails it with the pianos on ""Night in the City"", but the sound effects on ""Nathan La Freener"" are annoying."
3,It's About Time,Introduction of formulas a priori with only consecutive derivation is preceptionally inadequate. This combined with too a verbose and insufficiently organized progress of the argument makes for an uneasy reading.
1,haven't received audio book yet please send it.,i have not received the audio book yet please check on it and have it sent- I would really appreciate receiving the cd i already paid for Please expedite the shipment thanks steff steffcondon@sbcglobal.net
2,Overpriced and poorly designed,"Unfortunately, this trike falls well below expectations when it comes to a toddler using this to learn to ride a wheeled toy. The front pedal's circumference is too small for a toddler to generate adequate leverage to propel the trike forward, so, like another poster stated, the cheap plastic tricycles are a better option. Another flaw is that the pedals are too small, and my daughter's feet consistently slide off of them. Kettler developed a fix for this; they are happy to sell a set of toe clips to you for an additional $20. I would choose a different product."
2,Not a great design,"We have had this bike for a while now, and I frequently have to tighten the steering bolt as my daughters seem to keep loosening it up. As one of the earlier posters mentioned, this is a poor desing for such an expensive toy.On the good side, the kids love it when it works, and it is great for taking them on walks when the little one wnat to 'ride'."
3,Kettler Air Navigator - mixed review,"On the plus side: 1)The trike is well made of excellent quality materials; 2) My 3-year-old can ride it on grass, gravel or the street easily. The BIG problem - 3-in-1 free wheel is advertised as offering peddling, coasting and braking; however, the brakes are a bad design. The pneumatic tires allow the bike to coast pretty fast on inclines, and when the peddles are reversed the trike lurches like a car that popped the clutch. Brake design consists of metal gears that are forced together. Why did Kettler try to reinvent bicycle brakes? Who knows, but I suggest trying the Air Happy with the hand brake, although that's an odd braking system, too."
2,Our son doesn't enjoy this trike,"We bought this tricylce when my son was two with the understanding that he'd be about three before being able to pedal it. Our son is a tall child (38"" tall and 38 pounds) and has trouble pedaling this tricylce. I think the problem is that the trike is too low and too heavy. He rides the more typically designed trikes with ease (trikes with a higher seat that allows the child to pedal down rather than out). This trike is more like a recumbent exercise bike which is a lot harder to pedal. We've also been very disappointed with the handle bar. It constantly twists out of alignment and has to be readjusted and the pedals skip which might have to do with the auto free wheel. Kettler USA, however, has been very easy to work with and their customer service has been excellent. They replaced the handle bar with no problems and questions asked. But, we are going to sell this very expensive trike and look for something that's easier for our son to ride (and probably cheaper!)."
2,Definitively no good for pedaling,"I thought that my two years old daughter was not able to pedal yet, until she used her friend's tricycle and she started pedaling like a professional. I felt horrible, because I was underestimating my child's pedaling skills. Her friend, who is a pro in pedaling could not even start moving when she hoped on my daughter's ""Air Navigator."" I regret having spent $200 in this supposedly very good tricycle. I would not recommend anybody to buy this trike. The auto - free wheel design is not a good feature."
2,"Nice trike, but poorly engineered.","We got this tricycle for our three-year-old daughter and she had a lot of trouble figuring out the coaster-style peddling system. One would think that spending so much for a trike would pretty much guarantee hassle-free use and maintenance. Wrong! The biggest hassle was when we needed to pump up the rear tire. There is no easy way to do this and Kettler's description of how to do this is really a joke. If you ever get a flat on on one of the tires, be prepared for a pain in the butt process to get it inflated again. This just isn't very well thought out. We gave it away to our neighbor and got our daughter a regular trike and she's a happy camper."
4,Love it,"My daughter loves this tricycle. Not sure what everyone was crying about putting it together, it only took me 30 minutes. Though it was alittle expensive, I'm glad we paid the extra money. Love the way you can stear it with the handle. She cant reach the pedals yet, so she mostly just rides. It will grow with her."
4,complicated but good,"We bought this tricycle for our two year old granddaughter. Even though we raised three active boys, it is by far the most complicated riding vehicle we have ever put together. I felt like I needed to offer a seminar to her parents on the trike's features when we gave it to them. That said, it seems great and I like the adult steering handle for a child her age. It is well built and hopefully will last a few years, through any siblings she may have. I also like the big tires and the rear basket. She,of course, loves it,which is its most important feature. It is supposed to grow with her until she is five, but is seems a little small for that - I could be wrong."
4,Pretty slick ride for a 2-3 year-old,"My son has had the Air-Navigator for about a year now and loves it. The bucket is a nice addition - he likes to collect rocks and leaves on our rides and throw them in there. The handle works well and is long enough that I (6' 1"") don't have to lean over at all on our walks/rides.I have two complaints about the item:1. The tricycle has a locking mechanism in the stem that, when engaged, prevents the front wheel from turning significantly. This helps the bike track better when engaged. Unfortunately, this locking mechanism doesn't work very well and keeps coming disengaged.2. The tire valves are very short, stiff, and angled towards parallel with the inside of the wheel rather than outwards. I've had trouble finding a pump that can latch on to these valves to reinflate the tires."
4,Rear-wheel steering explained,"The whole time I was researching this product, I thought that the rear wheel steering was linked to the front wheel - countersteering to provide a reduced turning radius. And I couldn't see from any of the photos or the owner's manual how that was supposed to happen.Since neither Amazon's nor the manufacturer's description makes this clear, here's how it works:The rear wheel steering is only used when the parent is pushing with the pushbar. You lock the front wheel, unlock the rear wheels, insert the pushbar, and you can steer it from behind. When it's the kids turn to drive, you remove the pushbar, lock the rear wheels, and unlock the front wheel.Maybe it's just me, but this certainly wasn't clear from anything I'd read online."
3,"great, but there's a deal breaker","So I can echo all the positive things about build quality and longevity, but there's an engineering flaw that, for me, would be a deal breaker if I didn't already own it.The mechanism by which the handlebars attach to the steering column is VERY poorly designed. Its held together by one bolt that applies pressure to a ring which grips the steering column by squeezing, transfering the motion of the handlebars to the wheel. If this single bolt isn't tightened 110%, to near the point of snapping, the handlebars can turn but the wheel stays where it is.This happens regularly with my 2 1/2 year old daughter and the bike instantly becomes unusable until someone tightens that bolt. If we had stairs around the house or backyard I wouldn't let her ride it for fear that she'd turn to avoid the stairs but the bike would keep on going straight.If there's a fix for this I'd love to know it because other than a critical thing like STEERING, this bike is top of the line."
4,"Great Tricycle, challenging to assemble","Just bought the Air Navigator for our 1.5 yr. old. Took me a solid hour to assemble with limited instructions (mainly graphical with very little text). You must read the instructions CAREFULLY..they are well thought out but have to be followed perfectly.The Air Navigator is very well built (great tires!), and a smooth ride even on the rough pavements of NYC. The pushbar could be a bit more solid for $220 but it works well.Buy the seat belt accessory and the footrest (for smaller kids whose feet don't yet reach the pedals)."
2,Not good for small to average sized child.,"I bought this trike when my son was about 1.5 yrs old. He couldn't pedal back then, but I attributed that to his young age and was okay just pushing him. Now, he's almost 3 and still has a lot of trouble pedaling, not because he can't pedal, but because the pedals are still not close enough. He's about average size for his age. Also, it is difficult to navigate when pushing this trike. On the positive side, the air filled tires make it a nice ride. If I had to purchase a trike again, I would save my money and buy a Radio Flyer."
4,The Western Dream,"This was my first reading of anything by Coover, and I was floored. There are other efforts, especially in the movies, to take a reflective look at the West as mythology, but nothing like this, nothing that's as rude and funny, and surreal.An un-named rider on a shapeshifting horse rides into an apparently deserted town. The image naturally conjures Clint Eastwood's man-with-no-name, riding into a town situated in an unearthly blank desert-scape. I was actually expecting the standard western hero/samurai warrior. But this rider is thrown into a whirlwind of western plot fixtures, exaggerated into crazed facsimiles. The rider is badged, beaten, shot at, imprisoned, chased by a posse, falls in love, jilts, gets jilted, . . .It's the man-with-no-name in a brutal dream, and like a dream, it makes sense at the time, but brazenly defies logic and reality in reflection. Kind of like the Western itself."
2,More Over praised Fiction,"Ghost Town, Robert Coover (7/02): This is an amazing novel in that it is simultaneously juvenile and pretentious. This attempt at a Beckian version of Cormak McCarthy succeeds on no level. The long drawn out prose are neither poetic nor sparse. The re-visioning of the cowboy myth, by portraying a violent grotesque environment, only come off as silly and has been done before. I could not tell whether the frequent, homey existential quips by the cowboys were supposed to make fun the of the genre or were meant to be profound. Yet, they succeeded at neither. In short, this is another over-praised novel by an author of noteworthy intentions but little original skill needed to pull it off."
5,A wonderful learning tool!,"I bought this book for my 16 month old son because he loves dogs, but to my surprise he learned to do all the actitives the dogs are doing, and he has so much fun doing them. He scratches his head, sniffs the pages, growls and barks when the dogs do. These actitives might not get him into an Ivy League college, but he has so much fun showing off is new skills to us and visitors that we think this book is great purchase! My son is now 18 months and we still read this book about 4 times a day!"
2,Lid Chipped on First Use,"We purchased this last week and after a single use, I was shocked to find a two-inch chip along the lip of the lid. We've asked Camp Chef to provide a replacement lid. I'll update this when I hear from Camp Chef. I do LOVE the design -- the channel for the meat thermometer, the three feet on the lid so that it too can be a cooking surface. Note that the Dutch oven comes WITH a lifter so that there's no need to purchase a separate one.9/17 Quick Response But Disappointing Response from Camp Chef Support -- ""I am sorry but we don't sell the lids separately, therefore, you will need to contact Amazon and have then exchange the dutch oven for you."" Bummer.9/19 Amazon wouldn't replace just the lid but was SO fast with the return/replace process. It took just three days -- entered the return on Monday, UPS picked up the box on Tuesday, UPS delivered the new unit on Wednesday. Amazing."
4,"Decent quality, but not a Lodge...","Ok, This is my 2nd dutch oven, and I've used my son's Scout Troop's Lodge ovens extensively.Pluses to the Camp Chef:-Mine came with a nice lid lifter.-Nice, Heavy duty cast iron.-Pre-Seasoned (and it was done well).-Lid doubles as a griddle (lid legs)Minuses:- Casting quality isn't as good as the Lodge. There are some pits and bumps.Overall, this is a good dutch oven, but the cooking surface is pitted, which means food can get lodged in those pits, making it harder to clean. The Lodge units I've used all had a fine, smooth(ER) surface.Still, it worked GREAT, I got it for Christmas, and I've used it 4 times before Jan 1...My favorite dish: Russian Cherry Delight! It'll make a grown man giggle! Try it, even in an Oven it's good!"
5,SO GOOD IT ALMOST RUINS ALL OTHER MUSIC,"It is a complete injustice to Tim Buckleys memory that this album is unavailable. I mean, we can buy cds of stuff that he never intended for release but we can't buy this which he considered, and quite rightly, his greatest achievement. Because of legal hassles we are denied the beauty of Starsailor.Well not quite denied, we could pay ridiculous amounts for one of those rare cds that are out there or we could track down the vinyl.I managed to download the album by dubious but not immoral means, (surely it is more immoral for the music to die than to be heard). I recommend you do the same. Once you've heard this album then all other music will sound dull in comparison."
5,Classic,"If you can think of a more experimental folk album, feel free to tell me, because I thought long and hard and can'tStarsailor pulls all the jazz elements Tim Buckley started to work with on albums likeHappy SadandLorca. Here, the chamber jazz and avant gaurd forays of those albums are pulled into an amazing whole.Starsailor is frightening, daring, jarring and lyrical. Buckely is using electronics here, against a small band of guitars, bass, drums, and a fantastic trumpet player.The music here is heavy as it gets: you would think this would collapse under the weight, but it never does. The architechture may be folk, but it is folk built strong enough to support Buckley's deep and textured sojourn to the absolute outer limits.Buckley was a folk singer, but you have to give him the highest admiration for his ability to take the biggest musical risks.And more so his ability to make them pay off."
1,Starsailor,"I think all Tim Buckleys output is great inc sefronia (Greetings From L.A being one of my favourite albums of any one), but cannot get in to this twaddle. No rhyme, no sense no tune (do I like the music ?,No. Am I doing a thesis on musical progression? Mmm very clever). I can see the emperor has no clothes but is stripped naked and look at the fool. Can any one say they put this on and really enjoy rather than just talking bol###cks about his experimentation etc"
2,Jorbi Spine Wedge,it was not what I expected from the photo but when I put more cushion on it it worked for me.
1,Condition appalling,"The condition of this book was terrible. For the rating it had, it was dreadful. Spine totally broken. All pages loose. I think all pages are there."
5,Dr. Shapiro's Perfect Weight Loss; The Visual Program,This was a real eye opener for me. It really helps me think about the choices I'm making and helping me make better ones.The book was recommended by my doctor.
1,Diets for dummies,I have bought this book twice! I thought the first time I might have missed something. I didn't.Save your money and go to McDonalds.
5,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss,"A fun book to look at as well as being informative! It will surprise you see the different foods you can eat for the same amout of calories, such as one bagel compared to 4 English Muffins! Leave it out for a great conversation piece!"
5,A Revelation of Common Sense.,"It's about time that someone put some common sense into eating. Dr. Shapiro does just that. He shows us with pictures and words that losing weight doesn't mean starving to death and doesn't mean giving up eating well both in quality and quanity. Common sense may tell you a lot of what Dr. Shapiro presents here (like, eat more fruit and vegitables and grain products such as breads). but he has taken the leg work out of determining what foods to eat. As he tells us, there are no bad foods. But, he shows how we can make choices that will fill us up, keep us healthy and help us shed the pounds without fads, starvation and chronic weight loss/weight gain cycles. This book is an eye openner to anyone wanting to loose weight or just eat healthier. A revelation of common sense."
4,"Simplistic, but impactful","I bought this book for the photos, and the photos are impactful. Nothing in the text was illuminating - in fact, it was so simplistic it was almost patronizing. However, the message in the photos was very very powerful. To actually see photo after photo in the ""poor choice"" column of things like croissants, scones, muffins, steak, cheese; and seeing photo after photo in the ""good choice"" column of vegetables, fruit, vegetables, fish, vegetables, beans, vegetables, etc. sends the message in a very clear way. We all know that we should eat more vegetables and less butter, but we don't always remember. To actually SEE the choices sends the message on a different level. Which, after all, is the whole point of this book. And the bottom line is, I see those pictures now every time I make a food choice and I'm eating much healthier!"
2,"Good start, but not necessarily practical.","This book was a very good start for my approach of eating a healthier sustainable diet, but his attack on meat, poultry, dairy got annoying. His advice is good, he points out simple common sense techniques to ""volumize"" your food. The pictures in this book really point out how some small fatty food equals a big sald, some cantelopue, and other stuff. It really gets you thinking. I would have given the book 3 or 4 stars, but his book has NO REPIPES. It would be a great book to be used in conjuntion with another similar book that contains recpies such as ""Volumetrics Weight-Control"" by Barbara Rolls. Thats how I use this book, I use it in conjunction with my Volumetrics Book, together you can eat healthy food that actually tastes good, feel more full on fewer calories. It is truly a diet that is sustainable."
3,Appearances truly can be deceiving,"At first I was taken in by the pictures and admit that this book has value to ""jumpstart"" your program mentally and help guide the reader toward healthier choices. Also, the presentation (visually) of the healthier food helped make the reader excited about eating and excited about making better choices. However, I found several inconsistencies in calorie values in the book and portion sizes, which was of some concern. I found myself questioning reported caloric values of food throughout the entire book when I discovered the same food with two different calorie values listed. One example: Canteloupe. Also, specifically with fruit, portion sizes for the calorie value were vague."
5,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss,This is an excellent book for weight loss.It's very informative.I was already on a weight loss program and this book enhances what I'm doing already.It gives me a lot of other food choices.This was highly recommended to me and I also bought one as a gift for a friend who is also on a weight loss program.They absolutely love it.
4,Picture Perfect,This book has great picture illustrations to compare certain foods and view how making the right food choices can be most effective when reducing caloric intake. I use the illustrations to point out smarter food choices to my patients on weightreduction diets.
4,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss,"This book contains valuable information to assist anyone trying to shed the pounds. If you are a diabetic, you must be reminded that this doesn't compare carbs but calories. That said, it allows you to visualize portions and values of food."
1,Stop the insanity revisited,"This seems to be a repeat of Powters book, volume of food for your calorie count, plus the no meat thing. Been there, done that. Don't waste your money!"
5,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss: The Visual Program for Permanent Weight Loss,good reference
4,As good as new,The refurbished printer is great. Scans with great ease and easy to go from scan to copy or anything else. Cartridges reasonable for this printer. Good quality prints
4,Photosmart Printer,Works great. THe ink is still costly but the printer works fine. Plug and Play ver easy
2,better buy another,"if you are looking for beautifull curls at the moment is awesome!, but 10 minuts latter it looks like you had flat iron =("
5,Dog feels much better,Noticed improvement in my dog within the first couple of days.She no longer has trouble getting up and no longer limps.I can tell she feels much better and acts younger.Makes you feel good when you can help your pet.
2,Wish it had been compatible with our dog.,"Although product seems to help our dog's arthritis in short time we have tried to use it both times (2 weeks each time), our 120 lb mastiff/shepherd does NOT tolerate this product well. She loses appetite on this product and frequently vomits morning after tablets are given. Symptoms disappeared within 2 days of discontinuing product.I wasted a lot of money it seems.If you buy, hope your animal has better tolerance for this supplement."
5,Quick and GREAT price!,"I have a cairn terrier and a shar-pei who both take Cosequin, so I like to stock up. There is no question that they are more comfortable and active when taking this product. My vet sells it, but this price was MUCH better. I got my package in a couple of days!"
2,Cosequin for Limping Husky,"So far I have not seen a difference in my husky's limping. She seemsto be getting worse,instead of better. I'm puzzled, and will continue to check with the vet....Hope this helps you, but it hasn't helped my girl."
5,WELL WORTH IT,"KELSEY, MY 11 YEAR OLD BLACK LAB HASN'T ACTED THIS ENERGETIC IN YEARS. I AM HANDICAP AND I HAD TRAINED HER TO ASSIST ME. SHE HADN'T BEEN HELPING MUCH IN YEARS. SO WE GOT LIZZY ANOTHER BLACK LAB. KELSEY NOW HURRYS BEFORE LIZZY CAN HELP. SHE'S HAPPY AGAIN"
5,Helpful for Arthritis,"These treats have been great for our large-breed, older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips. They're also one of the few Glucosamine treats that don't make him sick."
2,No remarkable improvement with my dog's limp am going to try another product,I was using Dosequin from my veternarian and thought I would try this. I have not seen any improvement. Am going to try a different product
3,broken tablets,About 20% of the tablets were broken due to poor handling. The cosequin is a must for my dogs healthy joints.
2,My dogs refuse to eat it,I can't speak for the effectiveness of the product - my dogs simply refuse to eat it. I've ordered the chews Cosequin before and they loved those. I could give those as treats. These tablets must taste something aweful - even if I put peanut butter on them they get left on the floor. Simply not worth it to me.
5,Best value around!,Best value I have found anywhere and has made a huge difference in my Golden's spunk and mobility!
5,Quality Product,I have been using this with my 14 1/2 yr old dog and it makes a big difference in her joint movement. I combine 2 of these with 1 Phycox and she goes on a 1.5 mile walk most days still. These are worth every penny.
4,Great Price,"I have no idea if these work - but my dogs eat them up and the price on Amazon is better than any other I've found. I'm using them as a preventative for my 2 performance dogs, in hopes that as they grow and be active that this is providing a little extra joint help."
2,Didn't Seem to Work,"Tried for quite a while, my dog seemed to get worse, more stiff and less playful + he would spit them out, had a hard time getting him to eat them. Went back to cod liver oil / salmon oil & baby aspirin, he is much happier."
5,This stuff works!,"This is the second bottle of Nutramax Cosequin I have purchased. My 8 year old dog, Bear, is a 100+lbs German Shepard/Lab mix.About a year ago he was having a real problem with getting up and down off the floor, stairs, etc. A few weeks after I started giving him the tablets his mobility vastly improved. His ""puppy attitude"" is back!This stuff works!!"
5,works for me,"I have an 8 yo yellow lab and a 5 yo lab/whippit mix. They both have arthritis. My lab has pretty severe arthritis in his left shoulder. He LOVES the tablets and they seem to be helping, along with his pain meds. I have to put the pills in peanutbutter for my mix, but I notice he doesn't seem to have such a hard time getting up and down lately.On my second bottle. Worth the money if it helps! I love my boys too much not to use it."
5,Great Quality,"These are great quality, sealed and secure. They are perfect for our large dog, who is experiencing joint pain as she ages."
5,Good Price,"Compared to what the pet chains are charging for these tablets, this was a Steal! I'll ask my dog what he thinks of them and post his reply."
5,"Dog loves them, so do I","Our dog thinks these are a treat, all the while helping her arthritis. It's been about a month since we started them. I don't see her limping anymore (before it was sporadic). She runs around like a puppy (she's 10 years old)!"
4,Cosequin (for dogs),Ordered this for a friend's dog and both the dog and the owners are very pleased with the product. The dog took to the chewy tablets right away and liked them.
1,consequin,"Very expensive trial....my dog has arthritis symptoms, but this product has done absolutely NOTHING to help. The only thing that helps her are adult dose aspirins. A waste of money."
4,Cosequin,"I have been giving this product to my 14 year weimaraner for about 2 years. I think it really helps him, he has some lameness in his hips and back but he is a 100lb dog and an old boy. I did take a break from it for a couple months about a year ago and I saw a difference in his mobility. I recommend it for any dog with the beginnings of lameness. I found that most of the time Amazon has the best price."
5,Great product - works for my sensitive Lab,"We've been using this for our chocolate lab since he was around a year old - so almost four years now. He has a very sensitive stomach and a lot of allergies yet this doesn't bother him at all. He even enjoys taking it before meals. We've used other glucosamine supplements before and he wouldn't eat them - we had to grind them up and sprinkle them on his food. With these we use them as a ""treat"" before meals.His joints are in excellent condition. When we first adopted him his vet said that he seemed to have some moderate hip problems. 3 years later while taking this the whole time his new vet says that there doesn't seem to be any problems with his hips at all.We will keep him on cosequin for the rest of his life! I would recommend this as a preventative supplement for any dog owner. It's saved us so much heartache and money at the vet and has kept our Lab active and comfortable."
5,Better then you can imagine!,"My brothers dog is 10 years old. ""Blizzard"" is a white German Sheppard. He has had hip problems since he was probably 3 years old. Within the past year, he gradually developed a problem in his left shoulder and could hardly get around. With his back legs only partially working, and 1 front leg barely working, it looked pretty bad for Blizzard. I ordered a bottle of Cosequin DS and told my brother to give it to Blizzard. Over a period of 3 weeks, Blizzard was getting up and moving around pretty good. Now, he hardly seems to have any problem with his left front leg. I am completely amazed at how well this stuff works. It aint cheap, but it is worth every penny."
4,Nutamax Cosequin DS Chewable Tablets 250 count,"These pills are given to my dog. I give them to him twice a day & I imagine he loves them as he takes them without a problem. Vet recommended them, so that's what I buy to keep my dog healthy. I'm satisfied with Amazon's free shipping & price.Thank you Amazon..."
4,large doog with rear leg issues,Our dog appears to have more energy and is making the stairs without any noticeable discomfort. He even takes the pills as if they are a treat. Nice product with nice results to date.
4,Dogs love them,I have a Cocker Spaniel and a Clumber Spaniel that are 12 years old. Both have joint problems and we have tried several products. These appear to be helping the dogs and it is not a big fight to medicate them twice a day. The dogs think that these are chewable treats. I also bought the soft chews in hopes that they would be easier. They soft chews are not needed since the dogs love the chewable tablets.I have just ordered my second bottle of these tablets. They have worked miracles with my two dogs. Upgrade to 5 stars.My 4th order of this product. It has done wonders for our dogs. Wish I could find the same for me.
5,Cosequin DS through Amazon,I have no complaints regarding my purchase of Cosequin DS chewables for my dogs from Amazon.com. I will definitely seek them out again for my next purchase.
5,Helps my dog tremendously,I have tried other brands but this formula helps my 9 year old Golden Retriever run like a puppy. Highly recommended. At first I was skeptical because of the price but after seeing the difference it makes in my dog's quality of life it is so worth it.
2,I didn't see any results,"I was looking for a cheap and more palatable alternative to Phycox for my Toller. She has had hip issues for a couple years and I miss seeing that spring in her step. I thought I would try Cosequin since the price wasn't too bad and it had rave reviews. I was really disappointed to see her have no improvement after 10 weeks. I'm very glad it works for a lot of dogs, but it didn't work for my girl."
5,Cosequin,Helped my old dog very much. She is now walking a lot easier and doesn't seem to have as much pain.
2,Cosequin DS,Excellent product; it took forever for it to be delivered. I had hoped there would be a bigger savings from Amazon than from local retail but there isn't. In the future I will probably buy locally - save the time and cost of shipping. Otherwise it is an excellent product!
2,not happy,I spent a lot of time researching different products and this had the best reviews and costumer satisfaction. But for my dog it's not working. I'm going back to using the people version of this. My dog has been on this over a week and still has a lot of pain. I wasted 64 dollars for nothing.
3,"Chewable, but will they?","Was a little disappointed in that my English bulldog will not eat the tablet by itself. He's normally not very picky, but at first would only take the Cosequin reluctantly and then spit it out. For his weight, he's supposed to get three tablets per day; the only way he'll take them is if it's wrapped up in something else like meat or cheese. Definitely not convenient, plus he's overweight, and this doesn't help getting his weight down if I'm giving him an additional 250 meat and cheese treats per jar. His vet recommended them though, so I'll keep giving them to him."
1,no help,"I tried it for 3 months, did not help my lab. Just my experience, others may have had a more positive outcome."
2,The kids win.,"Like other reviewers, I was disappointed with this book. We've come to expect much from the Berenstain Bears -- foremost: a lesson. This book details a frustrating situation that leaves the parents exhausted. Instead of going to bed like Papa Bear instructs, the kids dilly-dally around with toys, baths, books and more. The parents present a disunited front and the kids respond with chaos. In the end, Brother and Sister put Mama and Papa to bed then stay up to read books. The respect and obedience usually present in these stories is missing. In its place is whining, excuses and procrastination.I may have liked the book more, if I had bought it with different expectations. But with these loved characters, this story merely disappoints. I'm returning the book before reading it to my children."
2,Another disappointed Berenstain Bears fan...,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book. I love the Berenstain Bears and thought this book would offer my children some insight into dealing with our own ""bedtime battles."" Isn't that what our beloved Berenstain Bears books do? Teach a lesson? There is no moral in this book; Mama and Papa simply fall asleep reading to the cubs. Thus, the message this book seems to send is that if a child dawdles and fusses long enough, he/she can stay up all night reading books. I'm disappointed. I bought this book to address the problem, not to reinforce it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I would love to ask the authors what in the world they were thinking!!! Absolutely terrible book. Berenstein Bears are known for having a LESSON to be learned - I don't understand what the heck happened with this tale! It ends with mom and dad falling asleep after being so worn out by one stalling tactic after another and brother and sister bear staying up reading in their bed!! WHAT?!?! I couldn't believe it when I read the story - that is seriously how this ends?!?! No helpful lesson, no wise words to encourage your child why to skip the bedtime battle and just go to bed like mom and dad ask - nope, apparently the lesson here is if you run your parents ragged enough, they'll fall asleep and you can stay up. I was stunned and still can't believe this is actually a Berenstein Bears book. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!!!"
3,Interesting Ending,"Brother and Sister bear do not want to go to bed. They are told to pick up their toys but putts at it so they can stay up later. Papa puts in too much bubbles in their bubble bath. They argue over which stories to have read. In the end, Mama and Papa are asleep and the cubs lay in their beds reading."
1,Not the same,"Go get another Bearenstain Bears Book; this one almost seems like a rip-off version. The BB books are my son's (and my) favorite series. Unfortunately, in this one there is no moral, like the usual books have. The story dosen't really seem to have any point at all."
4,books,We bought this for our one year old daughter. She isn't quite into this type of book yet but my husband & I loved these books when we were kids and we're collecting them for our daughter.
1,No moral!,"I bought this book without reading through it b/c it's a Berenstain Bears book and they're always great books, right? Wrong! The parents are more like inexperienced babysitters than like seasoned and wise parents. The cubs win and get to stay up late b/c they fight bedtime. Do I really want to teach my kids that if they fight me long enough, they'll win and get what they want? I don't think so! I read this to my son once and refused to read it anymore and took it back to the store!I'm so saddened that I can't just buy a book without reading through it. The Berenstain Bears have fallen from glory."
2,Another poorly written Berenstain Bear's book,I'm refusing to buy any more Berenstain Bears books without reading through the entire thing from this point on.Having read several Berenstain Bears' books when I was little I'm used to a lesson being taught and learned throughout the book. I figured that by the end of the book Brother and Sister would have learned to be respectful and go to bed like their parents told them too. Wrong. At the end of the book Mama and Papa are so tired from the cubs giving them a hard time the entire story they fall asleep and the cubs can do whatever they want. What a poor lesson!If you are looking for good examples for your children skip this book!!Any of these books published after 2000 I have been disappointed with. I'm going to convince my daughter to trade books with me so she can have some of the older ones with a good lesson!
3,Disappointing Berenstain Bears,"My family and I are HUGE fans of the Berenstain Bears books- mostly for the lessons they teach. This particular volume didn't teach much of a lesson. Brother and Sister Bear were having ""Bedtime Battles"" every night and it was resolved by Mama and Papa Bear going to sleep before them. I think the older Berestain Bears books are better for lessons than the new ones."
2,Definitely NOT what I expect from Berenstain Bears!,"I can't believe I'm giving a Berenstain Bears book a 2-star review...our 4-yr-old loves them as much as I did as a kid, and so they're great for helping us work on a concept (lying, fighting, whining, etc) without lecturing all the time and having to resort to a hundred different ""discipline techniques"" to get a point across. We'll just refer to a story, and she remembers the lesson. Not so with this one! I bought it in a Scholastic book order, and it'll be donated to my daughter's classroom tomorrow! Moral of the story: whine and drag your feet long enough, and you win! NOT a lesson I want to teach my own kids. I agree with other reviewers who said it just seems ""off"" from the other Bear classics, and it's probably better than 2-stars for just readability factor, but for what I was looking for (a book with a lesson taught, what I've come to expect from BB), it fell way too short of the mark."
2,Was'nt too pleased...,"Was'nt too pleased with this cookbook. I prefer cookbooks that use ingredients that are easy to find at the store and include recipes with foods that I like. Might be partly my taste in food, but I did not like this cookbook. While I love many of Richard Simmon's products, this one did not do it for me."
2,"Not that flexiable, but good tech support","The IOGEAR reviews mentioned that they were easy to install. I found that it wasn't really the case. The first thing not mentioned in the instructions is that all firewalls have to be turned off. Next while there may be a lot of printers supported, they don't work with the Lexmark X125 (long shot that it would work for an all in one type), or the HP Phtotsmart 8100 series printer either. The good thing is that their tech support is very helpful and will take the time to work though the installation process. So for the flexibility I give it a 1, and for tech support a 4, for a 2.5. It would probably be a good idea for IOGEAR to post known and unknown printers that they are compatible with."
1,Does not work w/ NETGEAR WGR614 Router,Warning! This print server does not work with the NETGEAR WGR614 router. A tech support person for IOGEAR told me that they just can't get these two specific product models to communicate. Their tech support was very friendly though.
5,All Meat No Fat,"Mr. Wilson challenges our culture to return to the boundaries within our marriages which lead to healthy patterns of life. I am convinced that if a few marriages in each community practiced marriage in this vein, we could re-form an entire town, county or nation. Although this book targets the husband there is much that wives can glean. Truly re-forming marriage. A handbook. A book to be read again and again."
5,The Finest Marriage Book Ever Written,"In just over 100 pages, Wilson manages to do what thousands of pages of the normal pablum never get done: explain clearly what marriage is in God's eyes; the exact inter-relationship between headship, service and love; and how to put things on track from the beginning (or put them back on track if need be).Wilson's deep understanding of the practical outworking of covenants shines through every (often-humorous) paragraph, and his solidly-rooted theology keeps everything completely Christ-centered.Yet while every theologian should read Reforming Marriage, this is not a book written for theologians: it is a book for every Christian. Your systematic theology prof and your seemingly-retarded teenager will draw equally well from its wisdom. That's quite a feat; and an accomplishment carried out by few so well or as consistently as by Wilson. Praise God that he carries it out with this particularly vital topic."
4,Excellent Biblical Advice on Marriage,"If you've read your bible you shouldn't be surprised by anything in this book- it's all in there and it is sound doctrine- but it has been washed over, ignored, and disregarded by many churches/christians for the last 30 years. Thankfully we seem to be seeing the slow reemergence of this important topic. I call it a must read for any young single person hoping to marry one day AND for everyone else who is already married- husbands as well as wives. When BOTH parties in a marriage follow the biblical standard and purpose of marriage it is a beautiful and blessed thing! If you want your own personal ministry to carry Gods seal of approval, you must have your own household swept clean and put in order. This is a book that will motivate you to do just that."
1,Upsetting,"Basically I didn't realize feminism and Christianity couldn't mix. I guess I had always disregarded those parts of the bible that said women are inferior to men, but little did I know feminism was a tool created by ""wimpy men"" because of course women aren't capable of actually doing anything cause a man is always the one responsible for them and their actions. So with that said, I found what I read of this book demeaning and insulting to women and the fact that things written 200 years ago are still being used to fix modern day marriages seems a little backwards. I mean we don't still throw babies on rocks to punish people(Pslam 137), in fact we consider killing a baby that has not even come out of the womb wrong. The book twists the bible to fit its needs without any thought to women's development of person-hood."
5,A must read for anyone considering marriage!,"I highly recommend Douglas Wilson's book on Reforming Marriage. It will prove to be a great read for couples who have been married for 50 years and for those about to enter this wonderful covenant before God.Wilson cuts through the garbage that the world and much of contemporary evangelicalism has left in the field of marriage counselling. His thorough exegesis of key biblical passages and his straightforward style make this book an easy, entertaining and informative read. It is a book that I and my wife will read again and again.I also highly recommend any of the other books in Wilson's family series. Especially ""Fidelity"" which is the BEST book on the subject. ALL MEN should read this book, married or not."
1,Not as easy as it looks or they say.,"I found this sealer to be difficult to use. It is very difficult to get a good vacuum seal due to the clumsy method of putting the bags in a nozzle. Extreme pressure is needed to hold down and lock the top in order to create the vacuum and seal the bag. If you let up on the pressure, the vacuum seal is broken. I returned mine and would never buy another Rival sealer product again."
5,Rival VS105 Seal-A-Meal Vacuum Food Sealer,"I received the Rival VS105 Seal-A-Meal Vacuum Food Sealer and was very disappointed in DealYard. First it came in a crushed box to my home plus it did not come on time from them. Also I was suppose to get a Starter Bag Kit which should includes: Three 1 Quart Bags and Three 1 Gallon Bags which was not included. There also wasn't any directions that came with this item. They said the item was new, but when you don't get directions or the Started Bag Kit I really have to wonder if it is actully new. There is also no way for you to use rolls of bags. You can only use pre cut bags with this since thier is no way to seal the bottom of the bag comming off the roll. I did not get an response from my emails that I sent to DealYard, so they really don't care about thier customers."
1,The mind of africa,"If I had received the goods I could review the product. However, nothing has arrived until now. Finding a vendor that would send anything to New Zealand was a real challenge."
5,Good info,This book starts simple and lets you understand the basics so that when you get to the advanced topics its not such a step up.
1,Not useful for everyday conversation,"I speak french fluently and am always looking to increase my knowledge of colloquial french. This book is mostly filled with vulgar sayings and will only really help you if you're trying to offend someone. For a real slang dictionary, try Harrap's. It will help you more with day to day idioms and stuff that will help you express yourself more like a local. Don't waste your money on this book. I threw mine in the trash."
4,C'est dingue !,"If you study slang of the world, patterns arise. Whereas American slang has some patterns of onomatopoeia, and British slang favours rhymes, one learns through this book that French slang often flips words backwards, uses American slang with French intonations, and equates genitals with fruit. ""Street French,"" as Strutz calls it, is unabashed as slang is anywhere else, and if you never thought so, think again."
4,samiam,"This light is great, I wish all lights were like this. What IS a safety hazard are the jack***es with the 10,000 candlepower megalights that blind every oncoming cyclist from 200 yards. I ride on a fairly dark trail and frequently risk a major collision because some jerk needs the 20 feet in front of him to be bright as midday. This flasher is perfect in allowing you to be seen while not creating a safety hazard for other riders. Its also very lightweight. I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars though because I had one stop working after a year, though granted it was after a year of every day use."
2,"Too big, Not bright enough, try another","Its too big, just one led its not bright enough.I would recommend try another one, there are plenty of themWith one led, or with 3 leds its fine.Usually Cateye makes great products, but NOT this one."
2,Nice Product - not for cell phones,"Great Idea - A person could experiance the web on their Treo 750 without paying for Data service. I am not sure if it's AT&T's control of my phone, but, It will not allow connection to the web via the WiFi. I can get connection with my home WiFi network - but the phone will not use it for Web access. No Real Spectec support available. Don't count on it... Not in the USA"
1,still can't install it,I've had many problems and still can't find a way to install it and make it work on my Treo 750
5,"Works very well, but tricky","This wi-fi card connects to my internet at home which is really great. The only problem I had was installing the software into my phone (Verizon Motorola Q9C). My advice is to add the software into the program files in the phone and then opening the program in the phone. It took me hours to finally install the software into the phone, and the directions that came w/ the software were very vague. Hopefully this makes sense and helps. Overall really great product!!"
1,Useless,"I bought this specifically for my Palm Treo 750. It did not work. I don't know what to do with it, now."
4,Browsing works but skype doesnt,"I have a palm treo 750 which I only bought because I saw this wifi card which I assumed would enable me to skype from the treo. Being that neither was particularly expensive and that I needed a new phone anyway, Im not too disappointed. If the wifi goes unused for a period of time you have to remove and reinsert the card to reactivate the wifi. A bit irritating but since I wont be using it that much its not a deal killer. And as implied, skype doesnt work on it. You can log in, see your contacts, and try to call a number but after one ring skype stalls. My wife has been able to stream NPR in the mornings which is going to be the wifi card's primary use. Since Im not sure if it is the card's fault or the phone's fault, I couldnt give it too poor of a rating. Would have been better if palm just got their act together and put together the phone they could have 3 years ago."
5,My most cherished book,"This book is an outstanding bargain. It is beautiful and breathtaking. I hadn't read the dimensions of the book before ordering and was really surprised when this 16 pound book arrived in its own cardboard case. The pictures are so gorgeous and some poster sized prints are included -- unfortunately, the images selected for the posters are not the most attractive of Seba's work. Before ordering, I had planned to cut out some of the prints for framing, but I can't bring myself to do that now --this book is just so amazing."
5,Ummm...,"Am I the only person who thinks it's ridiculous that someone's trying to get almost $2000 for a book I bought less than a decade ago in the Barnes & Noble bargain books section for $25? Come on, people. It's not like this is an original copy in the artist's own ink.That said, it's a wonderful book of amazing prints. It's just so not worth that much money for a reprint that's not even old."
5,Love this book!,"I wanted to buy this book for years!Now that I have it, I love to look at it over and over. I give this book to all my friends who work in the design field! They seem to adore it as much as I have. It makes a gorgeous decoupage also!"
5,These are a very nice addition to my dollhouse,"I have had these lamps for about two months, and they have worked very well. They add a nice touch to the rooms, and my dollhouse family loves them. They may not be the right scale for some miniature rooms, but they work well for the Plan Toys or Ryan's Room dollhouses. I have been doing miniatures for about two years now, and these are much easier for me than learning how to do the wiring for electric dollhouse lights. I recommend them!"
3,Fun read,"Enjoyed this book. Selected it because the main character was from my home town, which is Pottsville,Pa. by the way, not Pottstown as the Publishers weekly reviewer said in the review. In any case, a fun read; light but clever and witty with some unexpected developments."
5,RELATIVE DANGER - Certain addiciton!,"RELATIVE DANGER by Charles Benoit is truly of the best modern day adventure novels that I have read in a long time! Charles Benoit knows what he writes about and he takes you there without hesitation. All I can say is that to miss this Benoit classic is a crime. But fear not, when Benoit leaves you wanting more, you can get more great adventures in OUT OF ORDER and NOBLE LIES. Get addicted, NOW! with Benoit. You will not regret it!"
3,"Some clever moments, but...","Maybe I was expecting too much based on other reviews, but this book never caught fire for me. There were occasional glimmers of humor and suspense, but ultimately not enough to keep me riveted. Not much character development and the final wrap up was either too obvious or came from nowhere. A disappointment."
1,Maybe it's just me,"I bought this book based on the reviews. I found the prologue fascinating and began reading the story eagerly, but I immediately had a sense that the rest of the book had been written by someone else. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like I was reading fiction written either by or for high school students. I tried skipping ahead a bit but found the same problem throughout. Very disappointed."
4,Good Read,"A 4 might be generous but it's a good read. I have been in Singapore on business and pleasure and agree with other reviews that the author presents a good overview of the current mood in sterile, controlled, serious Singapore. The parts set in Raffles Hotel are right on. I have also visited Morocco and Egypt, but for much shorter periods of time. I think he caught their flavor also. You just have to live with the fact that so many people from a 1950 event are so easy to find and how neatly they come together. I plan to buy his other book."
3,1950s Foreign Intrigue,"This contains 4 episodes of the black & white TV series about two American newspaper reporters in Europe in the aftermath of World War II: ""Stolen Bird,"" ""Ghost in the Valley,"" ""Saw Mill"" and ""Steel Baron."""
5,School issued book,"I got this for PRE-AP Chemistry. The book is great! There are many problems throughout, a couple of answers in the back (made homework easier hehe), and lots of ""real world"" examples that make understanding topics easierOh, and I forgot to add that there is a workbook companion to the book. I don't think it had any answers though. The teacher always gave them to us."
4,Good screen but retraction is not great,"I got this for free, with Optoma HD65, so I can't really complain about the price! As far as performance goes, I like it. The surface has got very good gain as I compare with the neutral white wall. Black levels are definitely improved, again comparing with the image on the wall. Even when I move away from the center of the projectile or stand-up (I have the projector table-top) the brightness is maintained reasonably. No complaints there. Yes, as someone mentioned, it did smell, but it went away in a couple of days.Issues: The retraction system is a bit of pain. You need to develop a knack for releasing the cord in a way that it retracts and not stays pulled down. Otherwise, it's a pretty decent gray screen at this price."
1,Total and Complete Zzzzz...,"Where to begin, where, let's see. First off, ""Dr"" Wendlinger writes a book about how to improve your memory abilities, but bases this work on his own untested, unprovable opinions. It lacks credibility on all levels, but I would actually recommend this book for the untrained uneducated masses because they might, by trying one or two of the ""trigger"" be happy about a childhood memory. Why take credit for someone else's memory. I really enjoyed reading about Bob's life, but because this was a memory book, I felt cheated by the lack of references and exercises that should have helped me improve my life and lifestyle. The book is small, and lightweight. It's written on this strange paper that gives off a strange book odor. Don't say you weren't warned. Gave it a read, but can't recommend it."
4,Chock full of good info!!,"A wonderful book about a wonderful breed! This book offers some great insight to caring for, socializing and training your Mastiff and definitely helped me as a first time Mastiff owner!"
3,"Orchestral Who - Little Power, Excitement, Or Glory",Kind of a low key version of the Who. You can't replace Keith Moon with TWO orchestras.
2,Awkward to use and not supportive enough,Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare.
2,"Better than nothing, but not the best choice....","I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable. It wasn't quite what I was expecting, and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for. It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic).I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled. It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't. It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles. Ahhhhh."
2,"Sizing problems, not for sitting","According to the sizing guide, I should be a S/M, so that's the one I started with. To my shock, it was nowhere near closing...so I changed to the L/XL. Hey this isn't a vanity issue, I just need some relief. Unfortunately, this one didn't work either. It was way, way too big! I almost wrapped it twice around me and proceeded to do a half day of work at my home office.Which leads to my next point: this product is not made for sitting, which is a shame, because I just can't take the thing on and off, as I go through my day. Who has time for that? It rolled and bunched, defeating the purpose of getting a belt that is supposed to be more discreet under clothing.Maybe I'm just one of those weird pregnant women whose belly is proportionally too big for her frame. I do get the feeling that if they had a belt that fit me, it would help ease my back strain...while standing, that is."
3,"Too big, other size too small","My wife is having twins and she is 24 weeks pregnant. The small/medium was too small and the large/xlarge which we ordered is waaay too big. For all the money Medala makes you would think they could offer more than 2 sizes. The quality is good, but be sure of the fit before you order!"
4,works even for plus size,"The package said the l/xl was meant ""Pre-pregnancy dress size 14-20. Pre-pregnancy waist size 28""-34""."" I was a pre-pregnancy waist size 44"" and hips almost ten inches bigger. Yes I'm a bigger girl. But this stretches and gives me nice support. I don't know how I would make it through the third trimester without it.I couldn't walk and was super tired and immediately after putting it on I felt better and my SPD stopped acting up. Don't know how I made it through my first pregnancy without a support belt.It fits nicely under clothes. Good especially if you will be doing a lot of running around or standing. I got a little crampy when I sat down. so I had to open it.On another note I also bought the postpartum support belt (same brand/packaging style) but that seems to run a little big! I am returning it because it nearly fits me now at 30 weeks! That means it won't last long postpartum."
2,Scratchy Velcro Yuck,I got this belt second hand from a friend & it's a good thing I didn't waste my money. At first I thought I liked it until I figured out that it was the thing irritating my skin. The velcro is sown into the seams so it pokes out causing it to scratch & irritate your skin. It's not worth the little support it gives.
1,Didn't work for me,"I'm not a fan of this belt...at all. The material is a weak cloth and often while wearing it, the belt would scrunch and was bulky through my clothes. Also, it didn't offer the support that I needed."
2,Belly Belt,Product is flimsy and rolls up in back so its not smooth under clothing. I was hoping for something more rigid as it appears in the photo.
3,The Fabulous Ballroom Collection-Arthur Murray Orchestra,"I ordered the CD in order to have a variety of music for dancing and will be using it. It is not as good as a couple of other CDs I ordered; however, it is more than passable."
3,Older music for American Style Dancing,"I do not have this CD but I listened through the samples. It sounded like bunch of latin music with a little bit of standard music. However one thing that I will tell you about this CD is that if you are planning to dance any International style ballroom dancing, this CD is not for you. If you are dancing American style and enjoy old music from 50's buy it."
1,Nothing good about it.,In my openion their selecton of music was poor. I would never buy another one from these people.
2,Slowest Book Ever,My friend ... had read this book for the monthly book report. She reccomended to everyone! So I checked it out and started to read. Like 2 hours past and nothing really was going on...i was only on page 109 but still! I dont like it at all because it was so s l o w (slow). I reccomend it only to the people who have a lot of time and like books with alot of acting.
2,All Bad...,"OK, I really don't have anything against parodies, and I have a pretty open-minded sense of humor, but this book was just awful. Not once did I laugh...or even smirk for that matter. In fact, most of the time I didn't even know what was going on!The author continually jumps from outdated, overused clichés to lame jokes. I was expecting to actually 'meet' five people in hell, just as we did with the original in Heaven, and I was expecting it to be done in a humorous way, but not so. The book followed a VERY weak outline of the book it's parodying.Overall I do not recommend. It's really just not funny, and that was the whole reason I bought it. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I actually finished it...but believe me, it wasn't easy."
1,Waste of Time,"I agree with the previous reader that this book just isn't funny. I actually really liked 5 people...heaven and I was hoping for a really funny alternative view, but I think this book was just thrown together quickly in hopes of making a few bucks off the name of a bestselling book. I finished it, but only because I never quit reading a book. I keep going along hoping ""it can get better, right?"" The answer is no."
2,Not worth it...,"I love parodies. I love the book that this book attempts to make fun of. I have read other parodies of this book and laughed and laughed. With this one, I was wondering when it would end. I struggled to get through the whole book and in the end, I was happy I only ended up paying about a buck or two for it through the marketplace.I couldn't recommend this to anyone, though I had hoped it would be different. I was sorely mistaken."
1,Here's an alternative,"I love a good parody! This is not even close. Just a jumbled mess. But I wanted to let anyone reading reviews on this book know that if they are looking for a funny parody of Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven, a good alternative would be The Five Jerks You Meet on Earth by Ray Zardetto. It's a lighthearted story that keeps you smiling rather than making you feel sick, like this one."
1,ive never read this book and i dont think i want to,Just because you low lifes cant write a great book doesnt mean you have to go out making fun of books.Books are meant to enrich the mind not dull it.i have a sense of humor at things that are funny I hate parodys and i hate the fact tha crappy authors hae to make fun of good authors.Before you go around making fun of great books try writing a great book yourself
3,"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes,Vol.2","I bought the VHS version of this film,because I wanted to collect a VHS copy of some of the cartoons Warner Brothers produced during the 1930's and 1940's. Unfortunately it did not have one certain cartoon-The Colonel(Major?) Lied at Dawn,that it originally was supposed to have. So,I was sort of disappointed."
1,Not so necessary...,"Of the 'no-voice' documentaries I've seen, this one was by far the least interesting. Perhaps due to it's age, the newer ones I've seen, such as Baraka, make Necesidades look like a college art project. It's nice to play in the background...but not a sit and watch again and again type film."
4,where's the big band?!,"The reviwes that I read on the site were so good, but when I got the CD there were only 4 fast moving songs! I was very disapointed! This music is the best of all times! It's supost to be fun and moving fast enough to tap your foot to. I'm actuly wondering if the swing CD would be better than this one."
4,Cosequin DS Double Strength,This is my first time using the product. It contained a lot ingredients that other products I have used before. Begin using product about 2 weeks ago and it seems to be working.
3,No noticable results,"I bought this product for my 14 yr old Chessie/Shepherd. She has been losing mobility and strength in her hind legs for a few years. We have tried several products in hopes of finding one that really makes a big difference. This did not seem to help much. Also, she does not like to eat them so I have to crush them and put them in her food. I wouldn't say the product is not effective since my girl may be a unique case. She still loves to walk every day. I will keep on looking for that perfect product and wish luck to those with aging beauties like mine."
2,5 of one half dozen of another,Could see any improvement but it didn't hurt her either. I do know she hates the flavor of the chewables; had to hide in steaks or hot dogs.
1,"entertaining in parts, but not that well researched","I recently read this weighty book having picked it up at a local store. Some of the articles are interesting, but overall the reader is left with a feeling of disatisfaction and that the author's personal views color the final work. My own direct experience of researching some of the teachers mentioned suggests that the author has not gone that ""extra yard"" in his research. All of this is a shame. Maybe he could produce a revised version with greater attention to detail?"
1,a missed opportnity...,"I looked forward to reading this book, but as time progressed I felt increasingly that the author had a great deal of preconceptions about the subject. The detail about some of the ""masters"" was sketchy at best and the book did little to shed light on the substance of what they purported to be teaching. All a bit of a shame when this book could have been a valuable research tool. I also understand that the author lectures in Buddism which may account for a ""less than neutral"" account of some of the teachings!"
1,Why Johnny can't think......,"Another book on comparative religions so filled with bias and self-centered sarcasm one can hardly read from cover to cover. What has happened to our educational system that this sort of thing passes for intelligence? No wonder ""Johnny can't read"". If you want to learn about the influence of the East on the West from this perspective, skip the cost of the book and simply search the internet for dirt on the particular religion. What a complete disappointment. Andrew Rawlinson never seemed to come close to the lofty title much less most of the religions he criticized."
1,Not that exciting,"I read this having seen some previous reviews, but unfortunetely found it to be a tad dull and self indulgent. Now I have no doubt that the original intention was good, but the author seems to fixate on dtail that is not alltogether useful!"
1,650 worthless sheet (of paper),"The mixture that Mr. Rawlinson makes on this book is everything but ""enlightning"". The encyclopedic style is just on the surface, since the author focuses more on the personal details of the lives he choosed to write about, than on their specific spiritual standpoints. That makes this heavy book more a gossip than an academic work. It's tricky too, because it seems to put an impartial span of spiritual liders of the West, but, what he really wants is to advice about the deviations of this people. Which is not bad at all, if only he had the tools to do it. Instead, Mr. Rawlinson puts all in one bag and you get truly interesting perspectives (like Frithjof Schuon's Religio Perennis or ""trascendent unity of religions"") paired with plain crazy people.So, this book is not a help at all; the charts are not clear and have some mistakes here and there."
5,connie you are still the best,nobody can out sing CONNIE FRANCIS..the songs are good wish there was more...had the pleasure of seeing connie several times in concert..you will enjoy this album if you enjoy great singing..connie hall of fame...
5,Don't leave home without it!,"I loved this book so much! I spent 8 years in Georgia exploring the state to all four corners, and my favorite memories were derived from this book! It was everything I had hoped for in a camping guide as a newcomer to the state. I used it for multiple sites and always found the information to be ""spot on."" It was such a welcome relief knowing I was assured of options that didn't have me arriving at an unfamiliar campground after a long drive, only to find nothing but giant rigs, generators, and Japanese lanterns!Now, I have moved to Texas, and I just ordered the same title for Texas. I can only hope it offers half the gems that I found in Georgia via this handy book!"
1,Not impressed at all.,"I found this book to be extremely one-sided. Dr. Wofford repeatedly bashes any and every other religion other than Baptisim by making underhanded comments. It barely kept my attention and while reading it I found my mind wondering. He even states his own personal opinions. If you read it because you have to read it for a class or study, good luck."
5,Definetly a heavy cast iron skillet for sure.,I could tell that is wasn't a cheaply made item for the price I paid.It definetly was really heavy.I liked the feel of the handle in my hand.Looking forward to using it for the first time.
3,some trouble seasoning,"I am somewhat of a collector of cast iron--and I use my pieces daily. I have Wagner, Griswald, Lodge, Camp Chef, Emeril and some no-name pieces. I use several methods to season and maintain my pans, with good success. This 10 inch Camp Chef is the only one that seems resistant to becoming very slick and black. Don't get me wrong--it is a good pan in that it is relatively nonstick, holds heat, conducts evenly as you expect from cast iron. But for some reason, it is harder to layer on the seasoning. Like many made in China pans, it had a rougher surface than Lodge, Wagner etc. Perhaps this is the reason, although my other Chinese pans are not this difficult. It gets a 4 for performance but a 3 for the stubborn resistance to the classic black seasoned look that I have with all my other naked cast iron pans."
4,Useful pan,"I've been getting worried about all the bad press non-stick pans are getting, so I decided to try a cast iron pan. I've used various stainless steel and cast aluminum pans.This pan heats quickly and evenly - the handle gets hot so I keep oven mits handy. I love that I can use metal utensils. Cleanup is easy and quick. No worries about warping."
5,love it!,This pan has the *best* factory seasoning that I've ever come across. I've been babying my Lodge for a while now and it's still not as good as this one came out of the box.The weight is PERFECT for a woman. I can pick it up with one hand and easily pour off my gravy into a bowl - scraping with the other. This is my go-to pan from now on.
2,Good price but not weak,"This battery works well when fully charged. However, it does not have as long a cycle time as the original. Charging is significantly more frequent. Battery life is still TBD."
4,replacement battery,"Real good battery, charged it when i got it and it lasted a week before needing a recharge.Well worth the little extra over the standard battery"
1,Classrooms That Work,"For any experienced teacher, Cunningham's condescending, dogmatic style borders upon the insulting. Carefully read, her ""best methods"" approach, ""research-based"" book is neither supported, cited nor properly footnoted within the confines of her book. In spite of that fact, her books are being implented as if they were ""Bibles"" in numerous districts throughout the USA. In fact, the bureaucrats of the state of Illinois are requiring that we teach her methods!Most of the material covered in her books is so very basic that most any teacher does a great deal of it already while this author gets rich.Teaching is an art not a Patricia Cunningham book.I recommend that you save your money and buy something creative and thought-provoking to make teaching exciting and not (any more) exhausting."
1,Insincere,"I used to value Allington's words, but having heard him demean and disrespect colleagues as well as the disconnect between his spoken words and his written words, I would suggest that there are far more valuable books to spend time reading."
5,Worries free ...,"All went fine. No hassle or worries. Book was as described. It was not an optional purchase, but a mandatory one because it is a textbook."
4,"Excellent, especially for primary teachers","Pat has done a masterful job of combining the best balanced literacy practices into one easy-to-manage program. Her 4Blocks model is a surefire way to ensure that your students are learning from all angles. My only criticism is that the guided reading block does not quite fit for grades 3 and above. Pat says that your kids should read multiple books over the course of the week - each at different levels. However, beyond second grade, books are much longer, thus making it impossible to expose your students to such a wide range of levels each week."
4,Lots of Room,"This product has lots of room for our CD's & DVD's. It also looks nice. The shipping was fast. I originally thought it could use more shelves & after contacting the manufacturer, they were prompt in sending me more shelves. What service! I do see some irony in the fact that the cabinet is so well made & comes with a lock, but the back is made of cardboard that is easily coming off because of the usage. Go figure! Otherwise, a good product & serves it's purpose well."
5,Great algum for Big Brother fans!!!,If you enjoy watching the Big brother tv show you must have the brazilian cd version.The first track is absolutly great!!! The Big brother theme is perfect!!!Other tracks are nice and different!!!A must for any bbb fan!!!
2,Basic book for those with little knowledge.,"This book would be very good for those who are new to operating systems and have not previously used Win95. Much of the first half of the book is repetitive for those who have previous experience though the later sections on networking are well written and easily understood. Overall, a basic book, easy to understand but of limited use to those with previous experience of operating systems."
2,Not Enough Information,"Learn Windows NT in 10 minutes is a good book, but there is a lot more to the OS. I recommend Windows NT Administrator; List Price: $67.99. This is a great book that covers everything in book and CD. You get hands-on experience which is the most important part of learning windows NT."
5,Lovely Book,I just love this book. It is a devotional to your well being. A lot of the health and spiritual advice that is floating around in condensed in this book. Plus Victoria Moran is a good writer and seems to be such a positive person. I have read many of her books and always felt more empowered after finishing them.
3,Just OK,"I felt this book had too many interior drawings & that the plans were all too similar. While I know this book is a reproduction catalogue, other books from this genre have more varied styles illustrated in their floor plans."
5,Hotel Deep,"Does anyone know how I can contact the author about buying the artwork for this book? Kurt Cyrus is an outstanding artist and not a bad poet either. Hopefully he will grace us with a full length book at some point. My son and daughter both love his books and often look through them just for the pictures themselves and my son, who is just beginning to read, is able to follow the text. Another excellent book by the author"
1,"""Throwing the book"" at someone now = an empty threat.","I wouldn't call this a book. Softcover, 47 pages. Let's be honest -- this is a pamphlet.Did I mention it's 47 pages?P.S. It's 47 pages long."
3,A slip in the series?,"I really wanted to like this entry into the series. However, as fond as I was of the first one based on folk & fairy tales. (see my review) I confess I was somewhat disappointed by this one, it lacked some of the sparkle and good humor that the first Little Lit book has. The art is still creative & cutting edge, but the story lines were weak and not very engaging. As a Kim Deitch fan, I was delighted to see his surreal paean to felines. Buy it, if you want to collect the series. But start with #1. Be that as it may- I can't wait for #3 to appear!"
1,Light on content and actual instruction,"Though this item boasts a book, 3 CDs and one DVD, I found it to be far from a complete learning system. The book has only 2 pages covering notation, one page describes the violin itself and a mere 3 paragraphs are given to holding the bow and the instrument. If you are a beginner, there simply is not enough introductory material to properly introduce basic technique. On the DVD, an unemotional presenter monotonously delivers little substance. For example, she advises that the bow hair should be neither too tight nor too loose but never tells the viewer how to determine what is too tight and what is too loose.The accompaniment CDs are unmusical and sound like the piano part is played by a computer.Your money will be better spent taking just one lesson with a professional teacher near you."
1,Disappointed - Not a beginners course,"I am very disappointed in this course. I had such a desire to learn to play the violin but could not find an instructor in my town. I decided to purchase a violin and teach myself. I knew absolutely nothing about a violin and thought this course would take me through the steps. When advertising a ""teach yourself"" course should mean that it will start you from the beginning and explain everything. This course does not. Did not explain what the Letters were on top, where do you put your fingers, and does not let you know what page she is referring to while teaching. Immediately takes you though a scale exercise without teaching how to start or where to put your fingers. I had to go on youtube.com to help me answer some of the many many questions I had. It would also help if the camera was showing the fingering and where to start...none of that. This is not a beginners teach yourself course at all. I am very disappointed."
1,awful ripoff,"It is a totally misleading product. A music teaching item should have fundamentals in detail, and then individual practice items carefully produced to help in getting to know the notes on the instrument. This item treats the learner with virtual contempt."
1,Stay Away,Don't buy this. It is far from an 'introductory' method DVD or material. I echo everything the other posters have said regarding being grossly incomplete as far as explanation and teaching. It is basically a book of songs and a mediocre violin player demonstrating them (without instruction). Save your money and buy a real method book.
2,Not really promises to a baby,"The book begins with promises to a baby, but by the time we get to the 30's the book becomes more of a random assortment of musings and affirmations, along with loosely-corresponding Chopra family anecdotes and fables.Because of the hodgepodge nature of the ""promises"", I didn't take much away from the book, neither in terms of child rearing or life in general. By the end I was counting down as the author was counting up.As far as the audio edition is concerned, this book illustrates why many authors should not read their own works. The narration is very flat."
4,Great Reading,The book itself is a great book to read when you are expecting or anytime. The paper cover of the book (hard cover)had many black markings on it. That was a little disappointing. It was a gift but it did not look like a new one.
3,Pretty useful,"I have some crappy cabinets and these are very economical help for the narrow, yet tall spaces. Quality control not great - I had to have one replaced - but the price is right!"
4,Seville Classics,"The metal basket sticks a little but it is a good design, a mesh basket creats ease of viewing the contents."
4,Sturdy organizer for bathroom or kitchen,"This is a sturdy organizer. I was worried about it being wobbly, but it isn't. It was very easy to put together. The drawer slides easily. It works very well in my bathroom cabinet. It is very handy being that I have no drawers in the bathroom. I need to make the best of the space I do have and this organizer helps me do that."
1,Seville Basket,"I am not an engineer, but I followed the instructions to a T, and this thing kept falling apart. I could not get it to stay together. So, I decided to return for a refund. I filled out the request and the shipping to send it back was $9.74 REALLY? I paid $17 for this thing, so I decided to throw it in the trash."
3,useful,This storage unit needs to have a bar to connect the back legs together to make it more stable and something to keep the basket better in place.
3,Great Blues Rock Lead Guitar book,"I have quite a few guitar books. They are usually 1) technical and boring (and require tons of self motivation) 2) Guitar Licks and Ideas - fun stuff to learn but totally out of context musically and leave out how to PRACTICALLY find your own voice and 3) Creativity Stuff - i.e. sandbox for guitar so to speak, to remind you why you want to play in the first place (not to be a music theory teacher!). This book has a little of all these elements, especially #2 and #3. Check out his video jam on YouTube. If you like his playing style and hear some of your true guitar voice through his playing, then get the book. A little too short, but great licks that inspire a lot of ideas. I love his tone."
5,First Rate But Not For the Beginner,"Just going through this book at the most superficial level, I learned enough that made it worth the price. If you have been playing a while-I have been at it 35 years- and are obviously a blues rock fan, you can't go wrong with this package."
4,A fall favorite,"This is a nice, tart herb tea (not always readily available) that tastes great--especially around the fall and winter holidays. Its ingredients are pretty simple: cranberry and apple pieces, spiced with cinnamon and chicory, with a bit of hibiscus for coloring and blackberry leaves and camomile for added flavor. The tea does contain soy lecithin, so if that's a problem for you, you'll want to skip this one. With a bit of honey or Stevia to sweeten it, Cranberry Apple is a nice full-flavored tea to wake up your taste buds and compliment your turkey dinner at Thanksgiving or Christmas."
5,delicious snack,"These crackers are vacuum sealed in a firm can which both keeps the crackers from breaking and also keeps them very fresh. They are delicious. There are a variety of flavors inside the can and many of the types of these crackers, I have never tasted before. Great for travelling, they pack well and you can eat them out the the container. Watch out, they are so tasty that they are addicting."
2,this is the moment I lost interest in this band,"i have to say that there is always a point where a band or solo musician loses new ideas and inspiration and continues making albums to satisfy label contract agreements. sadly, the violets (or violet) have wilted and are no longer in bloom. their earlier albums were much better that this or the 2006 release. save your money and buy something better."
1,Whey Gold brown sugar,Very disappointed in this product. It does not act like brown sugar at all. I was unable to use it in cooking and it soon hardened too much to use it in food.
2,Celestron binoculars adapter,"This product is decent to attach large binoculars, but there is still some shake associated with it. I don't know if the perfect product exists."
3,Shaken and stirred,"The soups that I ordered were delicious. Let me begin with that. However, it took me awhile to receive them. The first order I received was only an empty box. Apparently it was damaged during shipping and was torn open. I emailed Amazon and they replaced the shipment immediately with no questions asked. THANK YOU.The second (same) shipment that I received was also damaged. This time, the outside of the packaging was fine, but the soups were leaking. Of the 32 total soup packets, 8 of them work broken open.The failing, I believe, is not in the shipping but rather the packaging of these. They need to be shipped in a tight box rather than the large box they were delivered.I operate a small shop inside an office building, and really would like to continue ordering these soups, however, they are too expensive to lose 25% upon delivery.Thanks, I look forward to improvements...at least in shipping.Regards,John Jean[...]."
2,Very expensive spice mix,"The reviews were good; variety sounded good, but by the time you add the chicken and the tomatoes and the milk, you've paid several dollars for about 1/2 cup of dried potatoes and spices. Was not surprised to see that potato is the primary ingredient.Yes, as reviewers said, nice blend of spices but unless you add quite a lot of your own ingredients to the pot, there is no substance - just nicely flavored milk/water. Will not buy again."
5,Great Book!,I just finished How Your Church Family Works. This is a GREAT BOOK! The examples really illustrated what the author was saying. I think it is useful to anyone who has conflicts with groups of people or individual people.
4,Helpful,"Steinke's system approach to congregational life is helpful regardless of the reader's current situation. My only wish is that his style was a little less technical. Regardless, it is a worthwhile read!"
4,Rob Thomas Down Under...,"First heard these fellas while visiting Sydney last year. The song ""Wildflowers"" caught me in it's profound lyric: ""We are all just earrings to the left of our parents, who are just haircuts to the left of theirs. And we all wonder, why do Nazi's grow like wildflowers?"" The stateside band they most resemble musically and lyrically would be Matchbox 20. So if you like the Rob Thomas and the boys, treat yourself to an Oz rendition; you won't be sorry. Just Beautiful!"
4,Read included instructions.,"This hub functions perfectly. I don't know how else to describe it. The first review on here must be wrought with user error, because it works just fine over here. He is most certainly correct, when you connect the power supply nothing happens at all! Seeing as we all know a usb hub requires a computer to be useful, we simply connect the usb to the computer (as instructed in the setup) and the circuit is completed. All lights function properly even with a ""found on the ground"" ac adapter, not just the one included. When you plug it in to one usb port, it turns it into 4, just like it was built and intended to do. I see no reason to give this product any less than 4 stars. I'd give it 5 but I just already own one, and didn't have to purchase it here so I know not of the customer service of the seller involved here."
1,Very weak,This is just a waste of money. The belt just looses its elasticity after a week and does not stay spread. It folds in between thus decreasing the area of contact with the stomach and increasing pain.
1,Not Effective,This item does not work-too flimsy!!! Buy a sturdier product!I was looking for one to replace the one I got in the hospital. It looked the same shape but the material is so thin and offers absolutely NO support. This was a waste of money.
1,Flimsy,"I bought this after my daughter was born to wear while my other compression band was being washed (it's the $17 one on Amazon). The material was not very sturdy and I felt like whatever compression was taking place came from the seams. No matter how tight I put it on, it still felt like there wasn't enough support where I wanted it the most. The material also snagged really easily when I washed it. The edges rolling up was another major drawback. I was always having to excuse myself to straighten it out again. The other one I had didn't do it nearly as much. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this. The cheaper one was the best one."
3,Loses shape far too quick.,"Ugh, wish I had seen the price it's listed here sooner. Bought this in Canada for $60. Anyway, worked for the first day, second day not as good, and by the third it was way too big. And it seemed kinda tight on the loosest band a couple days before. I should add that, no, I haven't changed shape myself. I bought it 3.5 weeks postpartum because support bands (and other maternity/baby products) are hard to find in Victoria. So it's not that it did the job and just doesn't fit anymore. Wish I could have my money back but no returns from the store I bought it from once it's opened.. even though it was $60..nice. I'm going to at least try what another reviewer suggested and wash it. Hell, maybe I'll dry it too even though it says not to. I'd like it to shrink afterall.."
2,not good as I thought,"I read the reviews and heard suggestions from my friends before getting this belt.When I use this belt around my tummy, the belt squeezes altogether after sometime and we need to adjust it again.There are no adjustment velcros when your tummy becomes slim. This is a major dis-advantage."
3,Not sure yet...,"I feel like it gives me the support I need after a c-section, but now 12days later it doesn't really fit. Def worked the first days following the surgery. I will have to wait and see how it works out."
2,uncomfortable and won't stay put,"very uncomfortable - material is stiff and slippery. the second you sit down, it bunches up and slides up. it doesn't stay in place! also, the velcro closure area gives a weird silhouette under your clothes -- you can tell something is sticking out (the edges of the tab). I have a waistline and am on the leaner side, just to give an idea of body type. I regret throwing out the box for this -- I'm on the hunt for something better that will stay put, something wider and made of a different fabric."
2,Not for me...,"This didn't fit me correctly. I am very curvy around the middle and this struck me as being made for longer, thick waisted women and not someone so hippy. It wouldn't stay in place and bunched up. The second I bent over it was out of place. I would be better off with a good corset."
2,Not comfortable,"I bought this to use after a C-section but found it too uncomfortable. It just does not stay put. Each time you sit, it rolls up from the bottom putting excess pressure on my stitches. Also in the days immediately following your C-section it cannot be put on without assistance. I think a panty girdle would have been a better buy."
4,Very useful,This is an absolute necessity. My wife is very comfortable wearing this and even feeding the baby with the belt on.
2,"Limited flexibility, too slippery","Really has a fairly narrow band of velcro, a bit wide, and it's slick, so it slips out of place easily. As a result I didn't end up able to use it for more than a few days as I began to shrink down postpartum."
2,Uncomfortable,"I used this belt after the births of my 2nd and 3rd babies. I like that it binds well, you don't want something with much stretch or it won't do what its supposed to (help your organs move back into place and help your abdominal muscles rebind). I found it too stiff though. It was very uncomfortable to sit or move around in and after just a few hours I'd have red burning skin from the edges of the velcro irritating it. When I would sit it would wrinkle up and because it was so hard the wrinkles would jab into me. I hardly wore it at all because it drove me nuts. After my first baby I just used a few yards of cheesecloth (gauze would work the same) which was very cozy but hard to put on myself and needed to be readjusted every few hours and of course was lumpy looking under clothes. Not sure what I'm going to do after my next baby is born (currently expecting). I've yet to find an affordable belt with good reviews."
1,Waste of time,"I tried to use this product two days after delivery as we were leaving the hospital. Before I was pregnant I was a size 0-2. I gained 40 lbs. during my pregnancy. I found that even after the 40 lb. weight gain, 2 days later I was still barely big enough to fit the band. Not only that but the top rolled down and made it extremely uncomfortable. It also isn't very long at all...doesn't cover every area that it needed to. Needless to say, if I remembered where my reciept was I would return this for a full refund..."
5,got to have it...don't miss out,I purchased this product a little over 2 months after my son was born. I was nervous I waited to long. But it works like a charm. I have noticed a huge difference and I am very close to being back to pre-baby weight (I work out and eat right too). It does ride up and roll but I just adjust it and forget about it. It is great!
1,Poor customer service,I must have accidentally ordered the wrong size of the belt and followed the instructions left on Amazon.com to contact the seller about returns. I left several messages and NEVER heard back from anyone. I ended up having to order the correct size from a different seller. How disappointing!
1,Belt rolls a lot,"The belt is really wide but I found it hard to put on (it seemed lumpy under my dress) and the top and bottom roll together even though I am not overweight. This happens especially when you are sitting a while. Uncomfortable - I really don't recommend this, you would do better with a thick ace bandage!"
1,Its useless.,"Diwakar's wife writing:This is the most useless support belt I have ever used. Even with the right size, it does not help with the compression. It does not stay in place unless you are standing straight. Once you move or sit, it just rides up to the slimmest part of your torso. other brands with elastic like material work much better."
1,uncomfortable,"I bought this a few weeks after I gave birth to my son. I wanted something to help get my stomach back in order. I found this extremely uncomfortable to wear with the velcro itching my skin. Also, the velcro area is not too flexable so it bunches up in odd ways often catching my clothing in the process. I only used it for a week and I couldn't take it anymore.... big disappointment for the medela name."
2,Only good for a week,"It fitted good on me for a week. After that, the elastic got stretched and its loosed and does not work good anymore.."
5,"Very comfortable and it works well, too! does not roll as much as most.",This is one of the most comfortable belly support I have used to date! I started using this the day of my surgery and am still using the same thing a month later. Adjusts very easily and stays closed!
2,Support,"It's good but the velcro woke my baby up, not that easy to put on by yourself, can't wear underneath clothes..looks ugly."
2,Doesn't fit!,"I bought the medium it was too small, bought this one and it was huge. Just didn't work for me."
2,runs big,I bought the l/xl postpartum belt but at 30 weeks pregnant it nearly fits me which means it won't fit me well after giving birth. I am returning it to the store I bought it from and purchasing the one I've been wanting and seen good reviews from here on amazon.
2,Probably not for after cesarian delivery,"I bought this after I had a cesarian delivery. I was really excited to get this product, and I was hoping that it would help with holding my stomach muscles. For me it fit correctly, but squeezed my stomach and put too much pressure on my stiches. I may wear it during my next pregnancy, but it was not what I was looking for after my delivery."
3,Better than nothing...,"I had considerable bleeding after delivery, and my nurse suggested I put this on to help the medication to help shrink my uterus back down. (I had it on my registry at the 'Rus store) Anyhow, it was tremendously helpful. Within a few hours my bleeding was under control and I was taken off the medication.But, and it's a big but-- there are better binders out there. This one works great the first few days, but after that it becomes stretched to the point that it bulges awkwardly in the middle as the other reviewers noted. Over the two weeks I wore it, I would get terrible muffin top (and I'm normally a size xsmall!) and then I started noticing poor posture all over again, as though I weren't wearing it at all.It's a great concept and Medela is a great brand. I just wish it were more rigid around the top and bottom to prevent excessive bunching and gapping. But this product did provide much needed postpartum relief, so I consider it an okay product: thus, 3 stars."
1,Don't Buy This,"I would not recommend you buy this. This did not help and it was uncomfortable. It slipped really easily, and I kept having to roll it back down."
4,gift,Bought it for my son and he has been using it with very good results. He plays in his community orchestra and occasionally in church.
5,Not perfect but resplendent,"I have read this book twice and I sometimes open it at random just to get the feeling and human excitement the writing brings to me. I grant you it's not perfect. There is some sloppiness and places where he goes too far, but this book is mesmerizing and lovely. I see that some of the reviewers seem to resent a person who is a rock and roll musician publishing a book of fiction. Well it so happens that Patti Smith IS a remarkable writer, and so is Richard Hell. (So is Jim Carroll for that matter -- it's his rock and roll that's doubtful. Same goes for Patti Smith in my opinion.) People also resent writing that deals with drug users. The lead character in this book is a drug addict -- yearning to get free of it -- but the book is about being human, in other words having animal drives that are contrary to one's ideals. It's sexy too. But even more it's about perception. The book's insights are as deep as any novel that's appeared in thirty years. You should read it."
1,These shoes would have rocked if you could walk in them..,"These shoes soles were so thin it was like wearing clown shoes, super skin tight shoe in blue 4 u!"
5,love these shoes,"good shoes, I love the idea, the only problem I have with them Is the lack of arch support, I needed to buy some Dr. scholles just to make these bearable to wear, they sure do look the shit though!!!"
3,NO POCKETS!!,i loved my old ipaths. i used to get a leather aligator designed black ipaths that dont exist anymore? i got them mainly for the pockets and i thoughts all or most had them and yet these dont? im kinda disapointed cause i have other shoes but i guess an extra pair. they look nice tho but NO POCKETS!!!
2,Looks Better on My Wall,"It looks better on my wall than with this screen.This screen is dark unless you are looking from dead-center so all those lumens you are paying for go to waste.If you are sitting in a position where the light reflects directly off a glass bead then you are going to get a ""sparkle"" at that spot and have to move to get rid of the artifact. I'm not impressed and regret purchasing this screen.I'd return it but the thing is huge and I threw out the box assuming I wouldn't need to return it. I would suggest looking further."
2,Not worth it... go and look for Janeway's,"I agree that the best part of this book is the cover. It is not only very expensive, but also the quality is very poor. It has some useful information, but not enough. If you want a GREAT Immunology Book, go and buy Charles Janeway's ""Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease"". Don't be tricked like me and end with this book on your shelve, and it is just occupying space. Trust me, not worth it!"
2,The cover is the best part,"This book is dissapointing. While this book does contain a wealth of information on immunology, this is more like a dictionnary than an atlas. The ""1000 illustrations"" well reproduced black and white illustrations, but they are not very well done or helpfull. There are a few black and white photographs, but absolutely no color in the whole book (other than the cover, which probably is the best part of this book). I do not recommend this book.I recommend the Atlas of Allergic Diseases, by Lieberman and Blaiss. Excellent diagrams and pictures (all color!)."
3,Atlas of immunology,"Eu gostei muito do livro adquirido, o conteúdo de grande clareza e manuseio, só no o coloco como 4 estrelas por ser preto e branco no adequado para um livro que leva o nome de ATLAS e também pela qualidade do papel usado na impresso o qual poderia ser de melhor qualidade."
4,Air Lift / Load Lifter 57275,"Good product, I was able to install it without trouble. I've been happy with the Air Lift, 10 psi is all I need in the springs to level out the truck when towing my camp trailer. The compressor would be nice if you need to adjust psi often. A bicycle tire pump is all I need to adjust psi for my needs on weekends."
5,This is one of the funniest MST3000 there is!,"This is my favorite MsT 3000. The whole thing about the people with the giant foreheads is halarious. I think that is you like the Mystery Science Theater 3000 series, you will love this movie!!!"
3,Decent incarnation of MST3K,"The Bottom Line:The film version of Mystery Science Theater 3000 has some great lines and can produce gales of laughter, but the scenes on the Satellite of Love are boring and never funny and the movie starts feeling a bit long even at under 80 minutes; if you're a fan of the show check it out but expect a bit of an uneven performance from everyone's favorite wisecracking movie-watchers.2.5/4"
4,"""This Island Earth"" Gets The Royal MST Treatment!","Our friends at MST3K have made it to the big screen! The gang's often-hysterically funny running commentary this time hones in on ""This Island Earth"", a film that Leonard Maltin gave 3 stars (wonder why; it's terrible and worthy of the barbs it receives in this film). But I wonder why this ""feature""-length motion picture has a shorter run time than a single episode of the TV series? Curious? Anyhow...it's still good fun!"
5,"No, I can't digest milk..aughhh..","This movie rules just for the fact it's what we all do when watching crappy movies. I saw ""This Island Earth"" when I was about 8 on a uhf station back in the 70's. It sucked then, but now I think it's genius. If you have a pulse, purchase this DVD...and his casket was made entirely out of coconuts, thank you......."
4,"My first taste, and I'm itching for more.","I finally got around to seeing this one about a week ago, and subsequently laughed myself silly. I had been familiar with MST3K through the press, but had never been witness to its inspired lunacy. It also helped that I have a deep fondness for the science fiction movie of the 50's, so be forewarned, this is NOT everyone's cup of tea. I however, loved this one and am now waiting for reruns on the Canadian equivalent of the Sci-Fi Channel (the video stores around here, for some unknown reason, only stock the movie). So check this one out, and be prepared to roll on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter."
4,Terrific,Terrific movie. Great old film that makes no sense to the more logical youth of today who appreciate old movies that are complete obscure sci fi.
1,REALLY???,"Love the Movie. It's a cult classic, but...1. $10 for a streaming video2. with quality questionable at best &3. you cannot play it on an Android phoneWill never purchase another streaming movie"
4,Sarcastic,"The movie stands alone! The movie features Tom , Crow, Mike, Gypsie and the Mad Scientist Guy. It's pretty good and sets a good example for sarcasism."
5,Synopsis of Episode Guide,"The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide is the standard by which all television show companion guides will be measured. Written by the actual writers of the innovative cult televison show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" in which a man and two puppets watch and riducle some of the worst movies ever made. This episode guide contains plot points of every episode from the television show, short stories written by each of the show's writers, and more pictures than your average issue of Tiger Bot. This book was writen well, and was pretty insightful as to the Television Show and the people who make it. A definite must for MST3K fans So if your a fan of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: the T.V. show"" you should pick up a copy this amazing episode guide, put it in a dark place with your X-men back issues, because you never know, it may go up in value, but then again, you might want to read it, in which case you should buy two. END"
5,74 Minutes of Funny,"I'll keep this very brief...It's not too darned often that I'll give a five star review to such a slim product. This new DVD re-release contains no extras whatsoever (not even chapter selection). Furthermore, the whole thing clocks in at just over 74 minutes (and that includes the end credits).Nevertheless, those 74 minutes are among the funniest 74 minutes of any comedy film ever made. On that basis -- and on that basis alone -- this disc is worth your time and money.If you're a longtime MSTie, you'll want to get this (assuming you don't own it already). If you've never seen an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" before in your life, this is as good an introduction to the show as you can find."
3,Not as Funny as the Television Show,"Besides the Marx Brothers, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is the funniest thing I have ever had the pleasure to launch a heartfelt guffaw over. So it was with some disappointment that I watched this film. I find that one episode from the television series - any episode - has about five times more laughs than this feature film. Not that it is not funny. The fact that it less funny only serves testament to how hilarious the television show is. I was pleasently surprised that, given the PG-13 rating, they kept the lewd jokes to a minimum. I have never cared for scatological humor.Devotees of the show will no doubt want to check this film out for a few new rinkles like actually using an ""A"" film for once (""This Island Earth"") to lampoon. Others will miss nothing if they pass this 35 millimeter version up for one of its videotaped siblings."
1,What the Heck?,"I have the movie on tape, and I just looked it up on amazon.Why is the price so high?the Movie is decent but I gave it one star because of the price"
1,rent it,this was a gift for and ex boy friend and this was an ok fil not realy worth the hype he gave me to get it for him
1,Mystery Science Torture 3000,"Unfortunately they don't screen the TV show here so I didn't know what I was getting myself into. When I read that they were showing a movie on TV about a guy who is forced to watch one of the worst movies in the world, I didn't know that guy was about to become me! Take a bad movie, replace the lines so that all hint of plot is gone, and you are basically left with nothing but a few funny jokes that you could've told better yourself, dragged out over more than an hour.Congratulations to one of the worst movies I've ever seen half of."
3,Not as good as the series but still a grand old time,This was a cool movie based on an even cooler TV show. But don't let the fact that it is not as good as an average episode divert you from buying this flick. It has some great jokes and is basically fun movie to watch with a group. The one setback is that the skits in between really aren't up to par with the regular stuff.
3,"If you are a fan, of course you have to have it!","This has been long overdue on DVD, and it has a place in any MST3K's collection. But is it worth the price? The answer is still no, running at just over an 1 hour 20 minutes, it is significantly shorter than the original movie, it is shorter than the TV shows by 20 minutes. I had hoped that it would contain some extras, any kind of extras. But sadly no, just the movie at a premium price."
5,hilarious,This movie has everything if you don't have cable buy it .............. Why are you still reading me go go go get it now
1,"Great Movie, Barebones DVD","I love MST3k. But this release is laughable. Would it be that hard to include some special features? It doesn't even have the trailer on it. I'd love to see a re-release with a retrospective feature on the series and movie, maybe a ""making of the robots"" feature too. Or something about This Island Earth even would be nice."
5,AMAZING!!!,"This is the greatest movie of all time. I can't get enough of it! Every time I watch it, I find something new that I missed the first couple of times. And it's hilarious to quote, too... Good movie for late-night movie nights!"
3,One of the best,"This is wall to wall fun if you're a MST3K fan.The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it is extremely light on special features (what special features???). Some of the earlier releases (of the ongoing show) at least had the original film being poked at in its entirety included for your own MST3K treatment.BUY IT. Even with no specials, it's cheap. There's no reason not to have this gem in your collection."
3,stunningly barren,"Aside from the new shiny cover, this DVD is a disappointment. It may as well just instantly play, there is no point to have a menu to simply tell you to play the disc. It doesn't even have a chapter menu. If I had known that, I would have picked up the German version of this film that has the original ""This island earth"" included.They could have included this in one of the MST3k boxsets and you'd have gotten far more value.I would almost say that $15 is too much to spend on something that is essentially a glorified VHS. That's not to say that the audio and video aren't good, its just such a dull little disc that I would say its only for serious fans."
2,lack of pinyin for English->Chinese a huge problem for English speakers learning Chinese,"As mentioned by another reviewer, the lack of pinyin in the English to Chinese part of this dictionary is a huge problem; it means that if you look up an English word and want to know how to pronounce the Chinese equivalent, you need to look up the Chinese (which requires looking up each character by radical and stroke count). Likewise, to learn more about each character within the Chinese, you need to look up each one by radical and stroke count rather than going directly to the character (since the Chinese part of the dictionary is sorted by pinyin, with a radical/stroke index).TheCollins Chinese Concise Dictionaryis very similar to this, but has that one glaring problem fixed, and is therefore much more useful. Its extra inch of width and half inch of height is definitely worth it."
5,"provocative,chilling repeat meetings with the electric chair","This novel is intricate and unforgettable. The now common phrase Dead Man Walking does not begin to capture the tense, sensitive life of an unfairly doomed man and a woman who takes such chances to love him. Challenges all our ideas about bearing fair witness, justice, and goes on for years. Rich character development, rich writing. A rare find."
4,Excellent adventure into Arkansas!,"I really enjoyed this book andWith (Stay More), both compliments of Amazon Prime membership. Neither is altogether realistic; both moved me to another life, the outdoors, the impossible, the harsh, the painful, the beautiful, and to a very pleasant ""read"" and a little stretching of my mind and my peace of mind. Thank you, Amazon, for the introduction to Harington. I would never have found this author in a regular library. Recommended! A 4-star rating because so much is implausible; a 5-star rating for the author's success at the fantastical. I really liked the rendering of the dialect and the social code--like my own KY childhood community: ""Stay all night with me...."". ""Ahh, I'd better go on home. Go home with me."""
2,An historical novel,"I am writing this review only because all the other reviews are so favorable. Harington develops his settings very competently, occasionally eloquently (see Pangburn's review of 8/7/03). There is plenty of plot. I was very interested at times, and I can see how some readers might love this book. However, his characters are not really developed, and I just could not take them seriously. When he describes life in prison, he does not have the skill to transform despair and horror into art. At other times the plot reads like a TV script. Enjoy the book as a kind of historical novel, if you can, but this is not good literature."
5,Motorcraft rotors,Decided to replace the rotors on my 2003 f150 instead of having to clean the old rotors and drop them off at a machine shop then come back later to pick them up. put in new wheel bearings and seals. new rotors had the outer races pressed in so I didn't spend extra time doing that. I always use Motor craft parts when they are reasonably priced. With free shipping these were a good deal. They are Motorcraft parts but they are made in China unfortunately.
4,Cherubusco Never Had it so Good!,"""Without Grace"" is a metaphor for life in small town USA. Carol Hoenig's main character enter's the reader's soul from the first page and never leaves.Vicky Finley's struggle is in some ways universal and in many ways, unique.This is writing at its best and I can easily see it as a television or ""big Screen"" movie.It is a rare author that can magically transform words into emotions and, with Vicky, my emotions ran the gamut as I consumed this wonderful book."
5,A captivating novel with characters that come to life on the pages...,"To say that Carol Hoenig is talented, or that she has a special skill with the written word would be a drastic understatement...'Without Grace' draws the reader in from the first chapter, and continues to do so throughout the novel. The contrast between Vicky and Brenda, the relationship between Vicky and the men in her family, and the underlying plot of big business vs. small towns makes it impossible to put the book down until its finished. Her characters come to life, taking on personalities that we either embrace (Vicky's, in my case), or are annoyed by (Brenda's)...'Without Grace' is the type of novel that should put Ms. Hoenig on the literary map, and has me looking forward to her next published novel."
2,Very disappointing.,"I returned these headphones as soon as I tried them. They have absolutely no noise-cancellation ability, they're not very comfortable and they're just clunky and a mess. I have tried and owned other noise-cancelling headphones for about the same price and they may not be the best but they do work, these do not. I only gave it 2 stars because I love the concept, now if someone would make some that actually work."
2,"Uncomfortable, unsecure fit with minimal noise reduction","This item is extremely uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. The hard plastic clips hurt my ears alot after extended wear (>30 mins). Also, the 70% noise reduction advertised is very misleading. Background noise is actually made up of many different sounds at different frequencies. After using these for commuting on bus and train, I found that these earphones are VERY effective at reducing certain sounds (70% definitely possible); and, completely useless at reducing other sounds. While sitting on the back of a bus (by engine), I found that it reduces the higher pitched engine noises very well. It did nothing to reduce the lower (bassy) rumbling of the tranny and wind. It also does nothing about conversations around me. I found that I had to turn the volume up much higher to hear my mp3 player than I did with my Sony Fontopia ex-81s which uses passive noise reduction via silicone ear pieces. I would pass on these headphones."
1,Go for a Laser,"I bought this for my Celestron 127mm reflector and it is horrible to collimate with. I spent days trying to collimate and was getting more frustrated by the hour and day. I set the collimating tool down and just happened to notice the center viewing hole is off center!Bought a laser collimator and, after marking the center of my primary I was, in a manner of minutes, was able to collimate the scope."
3,Creepy character study,"A good, brief novel for readers who like texture and ominous mood better than plot. Chapters are alternately in the voice of a voyeur (observant by definition), and a slow witted handyman (maddeningly blind to reality until the end) who is exploited by a malevolent third character. Overt and covert sexual exploitation dominates relationships here."
4,Review,"Although book wear was minimal, there was more highlighting than I would have expected for something listed as ""like new""."
5,Lovin' it,"I purchased these items as gifts for my young grandsons. At last check, they were loving them. The merchant's description was good, the items arrived as scheduled. I would recommend both the merchant and the product."
1,Poor design,"I will be returning two pairs of these shoes (the original order and the replacement) because the loops that the laces run through are not secure. As soon as I attempted to lace the shoe up, the loops, which are sewn on, began to come out. Its unfortunate because the shoe itself is very comfortable."
2,"This book does not live up to its title of ""Making Sense""","Walters becomes very wordy in her second chapter and continues throught the entire book this way. She has several interesting chapters in which she gives critical interpretations of popular films and television shows, however, they fail to make up for the dullness of the entire book. She is overly critical of previous methods of feminist criticism, while at the same time almost cocky about her own superior viewpoint. In the end, she never actually has a viewpoint of her own, except that someone else should pick up the ball and develop a new feminist methodology. Her wordiness seemed to be nothing more than a cover for a lack of original thought. This book is definately not for the new student of feminism or for the skeptic. There are many other enlightening books on the subject. Unfortunately this is not one of them and it would be terrible for the book to turn off any more people to the subject as it did myself."
5,Good choice!,"Jonathan took His time and did this right! You'll enjoy the many wonderful instrumentals, as well as Jonathans' version of ""Fire and Rain"", a James Taylor classic. As a ""bonus"" you can't help but appreciate ""Spirit of our Nation"" featuring a ""beautiful"" solo by one of Jonathans' daughters."
1,What happened?,"What happened to Mr. Butler? Once a magnificent songwriter with great, spiritual songs & lyrics, now music that makes Kenny G look funky like George Clinton.I wouldn't even abuse my elevator with this CD. I guy picking his guitar under 34bpm...all the time! How fun's that!?"
5,"""Jonathan"" CD",This CD is filled with beautiful music. Mandela Bay is my favorite. It is festive and has a sweet beat. Rio is relaxing and jazzy. Sweet Island Love is sweet. You will not be disappointed!
3,lightning in a bottle,"Solomon Burke, B.B. King, Larry Johnson, Natalie Cole, Mavis Staples Are Excellent. Well Filmed. Great Sound Quality. THEN CHUCK D. RUINS THE SHOW!!!"
3,"MARGINAL, TO SAY THE LEAST....","This album is not a hang by your balls Blues album....and by the way since when does a hollywood director know anything about music? I thought all modern directors cut thier teeth on the archies or some weird crap like that...Man, oh man, I am more then disappointed, the sound is tinny, the music is whiney, and insincere....I would give it 2 stars if I didnt respect the musicians on this album......Come on spend a little quality time with your mext musical project........Anyway....unless...and mean absolutely, you have to be a HUGE BLUES fan to take on this dumpy record....................."
4,Lighting in a Bottle 2 CD's,"I saw most of Lighting in a Bottle on my Satellite TV sometime last year and thought it was a good live performance by different talented musicians so decided to buy the double CD & DVD and for some reason tend to play the CD more saving the best for last with BB King Sweet Sixteen , four and a half out of 5 ."
4,almost great,This CD would have been absolutely great if it didn't include steven tyler/joe perry and chuck d....these 3 have no business on the same stage as all of the rest of this fantastic talent....Of course you can always FAST FORWARD through their segments
2,Poor and not flexible,I purchased this to wear for my wedding and was very dissapointed to say the least. It does not sit well on the body at all. Will not be using it!
3,No Intermediate Results Pictured in a How To book???,"I am a novice to brightwork and I most certainly enjoyed Wittman's photoessay of wonderful finished wood and beautiful wooden boats.What puzzles me is why the author shows no images of the processes she describes. All photos are of finished results. As a novice, I'd like to see what bleached wood looks like and how stain brings the wood back to life, etc.The companion book has exactly the same problem, by the way."
5,Essential reading for wooden boat owners,Do you own a wooden boat or a boat with a bunch of beautiful wood on it: get this book. Read it and rely on it.
3,Ok condition,"Book in ok condition, but it smells fungus.No sign of use that is a problem. Book is fun to read."
3,Dense Well-Written Modern Prose Poetry.,"It is obvious as you enter this book of poems why it was a prize winner. The poet is very talented. She has taken the tradition of the prose poem and jumped into it wholeheartedly. There are a few non-prose poems thrown in with titles which helps to break up the density of the prose poems.All that being said, this is not a book of poems for the lay reader. I came away feeling that this is artistically sound for those intrested in: post-modernism, surrealism and prose-poetry, but for the general public this may be a difficult book to delve into.I will be interested to see where this poet takes her style into the future because with lines (from page 7 in my edition) such as the following how can there not be promise!: Meet me two years earlier in the street. Omega Street. I'll try to be there, to be / perfectly present, to get the eyes right."
1,Absolute doggerel,"Google Karen Volkman online and there is this hilarious review written about her, which says what I think far better than I ever could. Volkman is a joke. That people like this teach?!?!"
2,great disappointment and will return it for something better,"I expected a lot from Celestron but got:1) an instruction sheet with tiny font and no information, at least that I could find, about how to turn down the volume on the blasting FM radio2) the telephoto lens that screws onto the machine backfired as far as I'm concerned. You have to go through a series of keystrokes to specify the telephoto lens function, and the instructions don't tell us if that has to be done every time the camera turns on, or if will stay in that mode until manually changed.3) the device turns off very quickly if not used. Thus it must be turned on again and again. Very annoying.4) the batteries are drained quickly. I didn't get more than about 30 pictures out of them.If you buy this, expect a lot of frustrating trial and error in the field. The instructions are horrible. This is a classic case of a tiny box with too many whistles and bells."
4,a review,Im very pleased with the pendant itself. But the chain was a let down. But i guess with price comparisons it is a good buy.
5,One of Maria's best performances,"Before Maria Felix appeared in this film, Mexican critics would say that Maria was incredibly beautiful, but her previous performances were not that brilliant. After this film, Maria won the Mexican Ariel for the best actress of the year. Undoublety, one of Maria Felix's best movies."
5,Great Band and Great Wristband,This is a nice fitting wristband and has an original symbol of one of the most influential Pop Rock bands of our generation.
2,No comfort here,"It looks pleasant and warm on the website, but in actuality, it's thin, crinkly (to the point of being noisy and rustling constantly with every move), unpleasantly lumpy, and generally not comforting at all. Not even appropriate for inflicting on the in-laws. The only positive point in its favor is that it's very soft on the surface. Overall, disappointing."
4,A more universal appeal,"Nice to hear a new voice from Portugal who isn't singing Fados. Pontes draws on a wide spectrum of music, giving this CD a more jazzy feel. There is nothing mournful about these selections, she celebrates life in all its vigor as depicted in her yoga pose on the cover. In fact, one could say there is more a Brazilian quality to her music, although she apparently draws on Portuguese popular music themes, bringing in such eclectic items as Swedish bagpipes and the Madagascar Valiha. She makes a very pleasant alternative to the current wave of Portuguese Fado singers who are currently dominating the World Music scene."
5,MicroSD in a Motorola SLVR,"The micro SD card was installed in a Motorola SLVR phone for more mp3 storage. There have been no issues with the card after 2 months of use. The SD adapter is useful for transfering files between my laptop and the phone, but I found using the Motorola phone tools software (and USB cable) to be more reliable for file recognition purposes."
5,Sandisk,"I am very pleased with this product. I have experience with Creative, Iriver and Toshiba MP3 devices and I like this one best of all. It is small, light, easy to use and has exceptional tone and picture clarity. Further, the Sandisk customer support is excellent. You can get them without a delay and they are very helpful in solving problems. As for Amazon.com, they are second to none that I have dealt with in making things right if the need arises."
5,Everything we expected,"Amazon had the best price, so we ordered it, and it came exactly when they said it would. We havent had any problems with it, so I would sat it was everything we expected."
5,Another solid product from SanDisk,"I've been using SanDisk products for over 3 years now. In the light of total drop of quality throughout the manufacturers of electronics SanDisk managed to surprise me with their proven record of reliability, good quality, and durability.I use the product for my LG Fusic cell phone. Not a single problem so far. I've purchased the product back in August 2006."
2,didn't work properly in my cell (Samsung 707),"This card didn't work properly in my cell phone, a Samsung A707 (Cingular Sync).Every time the cell was powered on, the card had to be reseated, otherwise it wouldn't be properly recognized.I saw this problem reported in a number of forums, though I don't remember Sandisk being explicitly mentioned.Getting a Kingston 1GB microsd card solved this problem."
4,Great,Well I bought a 1 gig memory card for my cell phone so I could put some ringtones and whatnot. I have put on a bunch a ringtones and it has worked very well for me. It's nice to have a memory card cause the phone has like no memory at all so it was a great buy. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,AWESOME,This is a great product and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Exactly what I needed. Thanks!
4,like the product,"like it a lot. thought i put the card in the adapter wrong and got it stuck the first time i tried it out, but it was all good in the end."
4,Don't skip out cause it's more,"Trust me your going to want this card if you have MP3's, ringtones and photo's. I do a lot of video editing and you would think 500gigs is a lot but i could fill that up with 15 hours of footage. Well add extra files to that and you run out of space. Same goes for this little chip. You start downloading MP3's and ringtones to the 512 and you'll run out and have to delete. So shell out a few extra go the extra step get the 1gig. Do you and your files that extra favor. If your phone has been real good this year get em the 2gig."
5,Works great,Not much to say other than its work in my Blackberry Pearl and it works great ...takes about 4 seconds to move a 6 meg song from my PC to the card... Highly recommended.
5,Worth the price,This product was delivered before the expected delivery date...as usuall when dealing with Amazon.com. Its amazing that 1 GB (wich holds a ton of files)can be on such a small disk. It has worked flawlessly in my cell phone now for 3 months. I also use a disk reader to pull the pictures to my computer. Its held up well. I recommend this size for any product that accepts it. No worries about running out of memory.
5,good product,"great memory card that holds plenty of songs. its amazing how small technology has become these days! turns any phone into a large music holding device, pretty cost efficient and a great price"
5,Just what I wanted & at a good price,It works...purchased it for my cell phone. It's a memorey card not much else to say about it. Price was right!
5,Worked Great For Cell Phone,Bought this for my new Motorola ROKR and after turn it off and then back on again it worked great and it fits more than enough pictures and music. Very pleased.
4,Great Memory Storage in a Small Package,"SanDisk is one of the best companies. This card is great for cameras, cell phones, etc. I purchased this microSD card for my LG VX 8300. It works well to take many pictures with the camera phone feature, videos, and store mp3s. It does however glitch occasionally, but I believe the cause it the phone itself. The camera will slow down and I will have to turn it off, take out the battery/microSD card and turn it back on. I believe this is due to the 1 GB size. I don't imagine i would have any trouble if the card was 512 MB. Overall I have had very few problems and recommend it."
1,Did not work,I used the micro SD in my new cell phone and it worked once but then it got fried or something cause it stopped working. The larger one didn't work at all. Not happy with it at all.
5,Works,"I've only tried this card in my Garmin Vista CX gps unit, and it has worked flawlessly so far. Writing information to it seemed slow, but it was a slow, borrowed computer and, heck, it is 1G of storage space in a chip the size of a pinkie fingernail."
5,"Versatile, small, and reliable","I've had this for more than a year now, and it's been reliable in all situations. I used it for document storage in college, as mp3-video-pic storage in my cell phone, and mp3 storage in my mp3 player. It's proven itself to be tiny, reliable, and versatile."
5,This is why i love Amazon!,I love amazon for sellers like this - they really make my life easy. Great packaging - quick shipping. The card was perfect!
5,Works perfect with my LG CU500,"I bought this item for my mobile phone, and I haven't had any problem so far."
5,Great card for your phone,I got this card when I got my new Sprint Fusiac phone. Now my mp3's fit and it's great.
5,San Disk 1gb mini SD Works Great in LP Fusic,Ordered 2 San Disk 1gb mini SD Trans Flash on Sat Dec 2 at 11AM. Received them on Monday Dec 4th in mail. Works just fine. I am very satisfied with product and very impressed with the delivery time. I do not know what else I could expect. Looking forward to the 2gb at a reasonable price to become available.
5,Works perfectly to unload pictures of my cell phone.,"Adds storage, easy transfer of files out of or into my cell phone. My pictures are now backed up and easily transferred to computer as well to safety deposit box. Thank you."
4,SanDisk,"This is a great product and the price was great. My only complaint is that there were no instructions with the disk. But, I was able to figure it out myself and have ejoyed using it."
1,Never received my order.,I am glad everyone else has had luck with the MicroSD Cards. I have been going back and forth between the post office and the company. No one seems to know what has happen to my cards. Apparently my cards got lost in the mail. I received only one email from the company and that's it. I guess I am out of my $25.00. I have never had this to happen before on Amazon I will never order from this company.
3,Amazon Kept Spamming me,"I dont really have anything to say. Amazon kept spamming me to write a review. It works, what else is there to say?"
5,MicroSD for my LG Fusic,"This product works great. Ordered from Amazon and arrived within a week. Have been storing music, video, and pictures on this card for months with no problems. Excellent buy at only $40 plus I got a 10% discount with my promo code. Comes with SD Adaptor to be able to read micro card on standard card readers. Don't need it with my LG Fusic USB cable."
4,Good buy,"This SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card definitely helped me increase the memory storage in my old LG phone. I then transferred it into my newer LG phone no problem. This was an overall good purchase and I recommend it to anyone looking for a moderate increase in storage for notes, pictures, and wall-papers etc. 1GB would probably not be sufficient enough for heavy users into massive phone gaming, high amounts of pictures, and other data storage. So the higher GB cards would be more suitable for those needs. No matter what SanDisk makes quality products."
4,Its awesome,"i was first not sure if I should order the SD card form here. I took a chance and very happy I did for that price. Its been a few weeks since i have it & its got I store all my music, pictures, and other files on my Sd Card"
5,Works Great with the Motorola E815,"I've owned the SanDisk 1GB MicroSD card and a Motorola E815 for about a month. I use the card primarily for storing MP3s, videos, and photos. Access time is great--it seems to work as fast as the on-board memory.This card will NOT work out-of-the-box in the E815. You will need to format the card on a computer using an SD and/or microSD USB reader. Get the SanDisk MobileMate 5-in-1 reader to do that ($13 on Amazon). It is not hard to format the card. If you use Windows, the card will show up as a new drive... simply go to 'My Computer', right-click on the new drive and choose 'Format'.This is one of a few 1GB microSD/TransFlash cards that have been made (as of May 2006). A-Data appears to also have a 1GB microSD card. A 2GB microSD card is the in the works for late 2006.This card ships with an SD adapter. So, you can put the microSD card inside the SD adapter to convert to a regular SD card."
5,SanDisk Micro card,This was a perfect fit for our cell phone and camera - 2 uses in one!The enclosed larger SD card was great to put the micro into and in to our card reader with no problems at all! I would highly recommend this item at the price we got it for. It was quality all the way.
5,Works great with LG VX8600 phone,"This card works with the LG VX8600 mobile phone. No extra steps or anything needed, just put it in and ready to sync up music with computer."
4,Works well,"The card works great in my mobile phone. Saves the trouble of sending pics from the phone (and paying the carrier for the privilege). The card is definitely not a speed demon when it comes to transferring data, but likely more than adequate for most any transflash application."
5,SanDisk never fails,"This card works flawlessly. Everything I have ever purchased from SanDisk has never failed me and this card is no exception. The speed and capacity of this card are simply amazing for the size. And the price was unbeatable. I bought two simply because they were so cheap. If you are looking for a reliable, cheap, functional card for your cell phone, MP3 player or whatever, this is the card for you."
5,Great Blade for the Price - Excellent Value,"I bought this as a Wedding Shower gift for my best friend's fiance. Because when I visit them and I want to cook dinner, selfishly, I was sick of using their $9 ""Target Special"" of a knife. So I was actually the first one to use this. It made short order of broccoli, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and both raw and frozen chicken breasts. It melts through most chopable foods with minimal effort and has a sturdy ergonomic feel in your hand.To compensate for materials, often times manufacturers will make the blade inordinately thin - this is not the case with this knife.I also visited them 6 months later and without a single sharpening the blade had maintained an impressive sharpness and repeated it's ease of chopping/dicing/mincing. Haven't seen a better knife at the $50 price point."
5,Bom-Bom-Bomberos,"So that is what my toddler sings when he wants this particular title track to be played (over and over again). Of Susy's 3 CDs, this is the one that has the best actual music. The rhythms definitely stick with you and your child. Susy's talent for entertaing children definitely shines with her 3rd CD!"
5,Another fantastic CD from Susy,"Susy Dorn's CDs are the best ones I've come across for learning Spanish through singing: once again her creativity and enthusiasm inspire us all to join in. Starting with the jolly 'Los Bomberos,' and finishing with the more contemplative 'Un Canto por la Paz,' the songs on this CD have memorable tunes and lyrics, covering a good range of pitch and tempo. Our three children (ages 4, 3 and not-quite-1) love listening to Susy's music again and again: this CD is helping us all to learn Spanish!"
4,Hoppy and the Lone Ranger are the best '50's western heros,"And this is a good story presented well. Yes Roy and Gene don't come close to Hoppy and the Lone Ranger. Now you know where I'm coming from. It's interesting to have the Internet and be able to go back into some of the history of the actors. Bonita Granville one of the stars, for example, was married to one of the principal's in the Ranger franchise. If I remember correctly it was Jack Chertock. Anyway, this is an easy movie to like."
5,LONE RANGER VIDEO,MY HUSBAND AND OUR GRANDSON WHO IS 6 YEARS OLD HAVE A COLLECTIION OF LONE RANGER VIDEOS. A MUTUAL LINK FROM THE PAST TO THE PRESENT.
4,"Lead belly, loud voice.","Don't let the track listing fool you, this has 21 tracks and is over 65 minutes long.I was looking for a good intro to Lead Belly's music and this one is as good as any you're going to find these days. While the sound quality jumps from clear to muddled, it isn't enough to draw you away from the juicy guitar tone that's chugging along. A few tracks feature piano and harmonica, but most are just the man and his 12 string Stella.I didn't think 12 string could fit in blues, but this adds so much muscle its not even funny.Your spouse may not dig it at all times, as its not happy music, but its a good ""open window, hazy with a slight breeze watch the day go by Sunday afternoon"" album. If you know what that means, buy it now."
5,Sony does it again,"portable cd players have a wide range of costs, but they usually depend on the functions included with the player. this one comes with what i think are necesary in a quality cd player: good audio quality and portablity. this has both, good sound and practical anti-skip functions, plus this one looks cool. there are other variations of this model, of course at higher costs. they include remote controls, alternative earphones and car kits. i chose to go with this model and use the money i saved to buy some nice sony headphones. it is a bit costly compared to the $12 cd players that are available, but remember you get what you paid for."
4,It's OK that they are not Barbies,"I was surprised by the poor review above--til I realized it was a young person looking at the dolls on line and not liking how plain they are. My friend has the Ryan's room dolls and we both like the simplicity--they are well made and sort of featureless--but that is good for freeplay--they are not supposed to look like anyone in particular. Our daughters are 3 and 4. THey are sturdy and simple, not fancy, and might take a little getting used to if kids are used to Barbie and Bratz, but these are really preferable."
3,Enjoyable but not great quality,"I bought these as a gift for a niece who received a Pottery Barn dollhouse for Christmas. Am told she likes them. I like that this isn't a typical nuclear family, especially since her parents are divorced. Honestly I was a bit disappointed when I looked at them, the clothes are so cheap and aren't removable, there is some glue visible in places, etc. I wouldn't buy them again but they did the trick!"
3,Poor replicas of a Hispanic family,"The skin tones are not accurate for the typical Hispanic family. These have an orange tint, like perhaps a Native American type of skin tone. Hispanics from the Southwest area are quite possibly native to that area, as well, but do not usually have the same rich tone. The costume dress is rather shabby, too...not very appealing."
5,Great Toys!,"These dolls are great for little girls. With their big feet (which I must say does look a bit funny) they can stand on upI put them in an old cigar box which I painted to look like a house and the little girls I gave them to just love them! I bought several of the Ryan's doll sets. There were the Hispanic dolls, African American & of course white. They are sturdy and they just look like they would be fun to play with."
4,rex review,"as a big fan of rex & the misery boys i look to get all their cds. I have them all except one. I like this one a lot though it is not the best one out there, Empty house is, no matter, i bought it and i like it."
2,Good game but still left out a hole bunch.,"I really think this is a good game but it has so much left out such as my favorite track and driver, Pocono and Jeremy Mayfeild #19 what the heck.On the indimidation thing yah thats cool but when your right behind the person your intimidating it will cuase a big wreck, because he gets loose up into you and you 2 hit the wall, what the heck. The career mode really really SUCKS! Exept for the part about the 4 other series. You cant be in the same place ant the same time."
1,"NASCAR 2005""Chase For The Cup""","I am writting to say, I will not buy this game because, the game opens up with a Featherlite , and then you have to earn points in order to just play this game in a normal""race mode"", it is a shame that EA Sports is doing this.Also when you select the difficulty level, you will not be able to change it.Its permanant.I did see a few comments on the EA Sports Discussion board, with people with simular complaints.I am very un-happy with the reviews that I see and heard, and had a deposit, but on August,31, 2004 I will not be going to pick up game, but to cancel this order.When EA Sports decided to have a normal NASCAR 2005 game that has a normal opening.I feel sorry for the kids who enjoy NASCAR and the level of difficulty is Medium to Hard and in order to race in Race Now mode you have to go thru Boot Camp to play."
3,"I like it, but.........","I think EA lost their direction with this game; they are trying to become GT-Nascar or something, and they missed the target. They left out a few of the real Winston Cup....opps, there I go again!.... Nextel Cup tracks, MAINLY one of my very favorites, Ponoco, and on the Busch.......oh darn......I'm sorry, National Series....they left out almost all the REAL track and put in these goofy FANTASY tracks...sorry, I fantasize a whole lot more about Nashville and Kentucky's Speedways that I ever would the Dodge Thunderdome. The gameplay is ok for the most part, but compared to 2003, or 2004's version, it lacks. Bottom line, if you want to race Nascar online, get 2004, if you want a full CUP experience, get 2003......."
3,A Very Impressive &#65533; and Academic&#65533; Work,"This book is impressive in it completeness. Unfortunately, its tone is extremely formal, and its suggested retail price is very high. It focuses almost exclusively on the psychology of acquired deafness, and says very little about the day-to-day challenges deafened people face."
3,Paying for the red white and blue,"The cap is nice it is raised sort of in 3D but at the same time it looked worn, maybe this is how it should look. I am a collector of Baseball style hats this now makes my 456 cap."
5,Well-made and patriotic!,"I had been looking for a good cap to wear when walking around town and when doing yardwork, and this cap does the job! It looks very nice, and is well-made. The letters and stars are embroidered, and the stripes are made of different pieces of fabric, not just a design. It has a sweatband in the front, and an adjustable back. I previously bought a cap from my college, and it was a bit too small for my head (the actual ""bowl"" of the hat, not the outside brim); however, this cap is of good size, and should fit those of you who have larger heads (the way I do!).Bottom line, this cap will protect your face from the sun, and show your patriotism as well! Very good value for the money, given the quality."
5,Heaven in a bag.,"I got addicted to Sahale's snacks from the Tully's Coffee that was downstairs at work. After pretty much buying them out they didn't restock in enough time so I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy in bulk from Amazon. My 3 favorites are Socorro, Ksar and Soledad. If you want a healthy snack that tastes like you're indulging in sinful goodness then this is the snack for you.Ksar is my personal favorite."
2,Not the Best of the Bunch,I've tried several other Sahale Snack and I loved them. This one was the exception. I think it was the figs that gave thie blend an off taste.
4,The Way of Jesus - my thoughts,"The Way of Jesus is a mind stretcher for people who are burned out on the demands of church life and ministry by a couple who has been in both situations. While it's not a slam at the church, it definitely speaks of the undue burdens that churches sometimes place on people. Campbell(s) speaks of a simplified plan to simply follow Jesus, and help those around you - family and friends - do the same. Great. Simple. Freeing. But what I wish they had spent some time talking about was...what do we do with the church as we know it? Is it to be chucked completely? Nothing much is said about this and I think it leaves the book too much in the theory department, not the practical department, which is where I'm at. I agree with much of what is said, but need tools to make it practical in my life."
1,Misleading image,"I purchased this mallets along with the Yamaha bell set. Though the bell set is excellent, the actually mallets I received is totally different from the picture, it's not double headed, probablly only half the length of what shown on the picture. I'm not sure about the description, since I did not read it carefully, so I did not returned it. But the image is really misleading."
2,"""The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 3""","I watched Chuck Jones three cartoons: ""Old Glory"", ""The Dover Boys"", and ""My Favorite Duck"" and also the Friz Freleng cartoons I've watched except for ""Pigs in a Polka"" and they're on this video."
1,The Oprah version? Are you kidding?,If I had ordered this assuming it was the David Attenborough version and ended up hearing Oprah's voice of illegitimate victimization instead I would have waited to eject the disk from the player so that I could vomit on it before returning it. But not before wiping boogars on the packaging.
1,DAVID YES- OPRAH NO,"Sadly, Oprah's narration of ""Life"" is horrible. Read some of the reviews for the single title ""Life"" by Oprah. Her narration is both childish and dreadful. If you want the best of these two beautiful and astonishing programs get ""Planet Earth"" and ""Life"" both narrated by David Attenborough. They are both available on Blu Ray and you will pay the about same amount as for the Attenborough-Oprah package. Both Life and Planet Earth are spectacular and feature some of the greatest nature photography you will ever see. I'm sorry to give this just one star. If both titles were by David Attenborough it would be five stars."
1,Oprah Winfrey? Really?,"Apparently, I'm not the only one who cannot listen to Oprah Winfrey's narration of ""Life""! Seriously, it's like she's talking to a first-grade class!"
3,great package but....,"Both series are beyond words, and the cinematography is beautiful! However it is too bad that the American version of 'Life' is included in the package. Not because of Oprah, she was actually quite nice, but because it is missing about 100 min. of footage cut from the original British version to suit commercial breaks! I don't understand why they whould tamper with this beautiful series. It would have had 5 stars if they hadn't cut that much footage."
3,This is not going to bring alternative back.,"This is CD is your average alternative album. It has a few cool tracks but the rest bore you. Get The Keys & Go is my favorite off the album...but I must agree with the previous reviewer that that song sounds very like Hum's song Why I Like Robins. I am afraid that the Llama Farmers will not be killing the pop music virus anytime soon, but maybe next time."
3,it's ok.,"it's an ok cd, but does anyone else know that ""Get the Keys and Go"" sounds VERY similar to Hum's ""Why I Like Robins""."
1,UMmmm.......................................................,Um Llama farmers what can I say? They supported FEEDER at the Cockpit In leeds and they were PANTS
1,The worse book I've ever read,"This is the worse book I've ever read. It has no new information in it and nothing to offer the reader. I have no idea how this ever got published. It was a waste of my 30 min (that's all the reading time this book takes because of everything is spread out due to the lack of content). It has no flow and at times you wonder ""what were they thinking???""Tracey"
5,Paul Kleinsmith,If you would like to obtain a copy try Victor Valley College in Victorville Ca. 92392. The book was used for many years as the text book for Dr. Kleinsmith courses.
4,So Cute- Baby Loves It,"Lots of laughing in this book- My eight month old loves it. She gets a big kick out of knee-slapping rolling-around-on-the-floor laughing scenes, which of course are played up by the reader for her benefit. Give it a try!"
1,Too Fluffy,"Having enjoyed Massons ""When Elephants Weep"" I expected a bit more than what I recieved from this book. His reference of the literature on animal behavior is impressive, however, his vast essays of his own opinion were a bit tiresome. When he took on a Dr. Spock attitude about raising children, it was especially boring and sometimes infuriating. I did not want to read about his first failed marriage and how his method of raising his first child differed form his second. If I wanted to know how to raise a child, I'd read a different book.Intruiging, but save your money or wait till your library has it."
1,Haphazard collection of random thoughts,"This book is a poorly organized and poorly conceived collection of half thoughts and ideas. Masson reviewed the scientific research on animal behavior. He then presents a few examples of how male animals nurture (or fail to nurture) their children. Masson's hypothesis is that if an animal father (from carp to penguin to wolf) takes care of his children, it is because of a conscious choice to be involved in the childrearing process. If, on the other hand, a male animal is not involved in child rearing, that too is a conscious choice, although usually by the mother to keep the father away. He then sympathizes with the poor male who must miss out on the wonderful joys of fatherhood.Fatherhood is a wonderful experience for humans. Whether other animals also experience this or any other emotional response is well worth exploring. Unfortunately, this book doesn't come close to addressing the issue."
4,Thought-provoking and bold,"While it is true that Masson asserts some claims in this book that are not yet proven at this point, he also states right away that he IS NOT a scientist. He is however, an amazing author and researcher. Every claim he asserts, while perhaps not backed by biology (yet) is followed by several extremely convincing examples. he has wonderful insight and some delightful thoughts and theories on animal behavior that the scientific community would do well to explore. Because Masson is not limited to the rules of scientific hypotheses, he has the ability to ask, not only ""Why?"", but also ""Why not?"" He reminds us that just because something has not YET been proven, does not mean its impossible. We discover new truths everyday. Read this book. Read what he has to say. Allow yourself to consider the possibilities. Ask yourself ""Why not?"" Then form your own opinion. This book may lead you to think in new directions, even if it convinces you of nothing else."
1,WARNING! BURNED UP!!,I bought one of these units a few months ago. One day the thing burnt up so I took it to my local repair shop. He told me that the unit used some type of cheap motor that was not repairable. The cost of the repair was more than the unit was worth! I am going to write Porter Cable about the junk that they are now selling!
2,Wish I had visited Sears,After ordering this I received the Sears flyer in the Sunday paper. Significantly better deals with greater capabilities and additional tools included for near half the price.
3,The jury is still out,"I recently bought this kit and added the 15ga. angle nailer to the set. Right now, the set is seeing heavy use. To keep it short... It looked like a great value, and so far I'm happy. The brad nailer's fit and finish are impressive for an inexpensive tool. It doesn't look or feel cheep. However, the safey is a pain. You have to press it down just right and lift it up far enough between shots or it doesn't shoot. I am a trim carpenter, and I use it a lot to pin my miters. This is an awkward problem. But so far it has worked well otherwise. The compressor is light and easy to carry which is great. It also seems to have plenty of power for the guns that I use, but it is awfully noisy and the recovery time is a bit slow. I haven't had it long, so I can't speak of it's durability. So far, I 'm glad that I bought it."
4,Great Tool,"This tool make short work out of a once boring task. It makes you wonder how you got along without it for so long. The motor is a bit loud, but it maintains pressure for a lengthly period. I'm happy with the tool."
1,ODD PROBLEM-BAD ENGINEERING,"After the second day the nailer became inoperable. The trigger cover would not depress the trigger. I fiddled around with it for a couple of hours becoming more and more frustrated. I remembered a review here about the safety. I noticed a small metal flap under the trigger. I don't know if this is a safety but this metal flap was not pushing the trigger cover. I took a piece a wire and tied the flap to the cover. This solved my problem. My question...why should I have to do this on a tool I've had two days?My other problem. In the box is a piece of paper that states call this phone number for problems before you call Amazon. I called the number(before I solved the problem). The only thing the Porter Cable person said was ""why don't you return it to Amazon. What do you want me to do?"" That's it. Why have that flyer in the box.I will think long and hard before I ever buy another Porter-Cable tool."
5,Great brad nailer,"I got this to do the trim work on a large laminate flooring project. It works great! I have since used it on interior window trim with great results as well. The air hose is long enough that I can set the compressor outside when working on a room, so the noise is not so bad. Highly recommend."
5,Well...I love it!,"Despite some of the negative reviews given (there always will be) I have been absolutely satisfied with this PC combo nailer kit and have had it for a little over a year with frequent use. The only negative thing I can say is ""Why did I wait so long to buy an air nailer?"" All these years I've been doing it the hard way because I didn't really think it was that much of an advantage. I was wrong.Later on, I bought the Hitachi 16-gage nailer for the bigger stuff like baseboards and casings and it all works great...just keep everything cleaned and oiled properly."
2,Fun while it lasted,"I had high hopes when I purchased this for my son. It worked great until the first crash. From there it was all downhill. First the tail broke and then the rotors constantly tore. Overall, very disappointed."
2,Dissapointed,"First the book came damaged. If I wanted a used looking book I could have paid alot less. Second, as a coffee table book, it had tiny pictures. Mostly text. Very dissapointing. If I wanted a history book it would have been wonderful, but I wanted a book with nice pictures of Dutch Masters Paintings. They also were obscure, not famous paintings. One reason not to buy online, you can not see what you are getting."
3,A Let Down For The Series,"I got this CD because I thought Volume 8: Duets in the series was outstanding. This CD doesn't live up to my expectations of having songs that make you want to stand up and dance. ""One Night In Bangkok"" from Chess and ""Who Couldn't Dance With You"" from Grand Hotel: The Musical are the only songs that prevent this CD from being a total waste of money. The others go on for way too long in length and rather uninspiring. The sad thing is there are so many awesome Broadway tunes that could have made this CD worthwhile but the makers decided to pick unsuccessful songs from unsuccessful musicals (West Side Story and ""We're In The Money"" being the only exceptions). Save your money and get Volume 8 instead."
4,Great adaptation but we only get half of the score,"One of the greatest film composers ever to grace the screen adapting a score from another of the cinema's greatest composers; one could ask for little more. In general, Danny Elfman sticks pretty close to Herrman's original music, but he speeds up the tempos and adds noisier orchestrations for the more exciting parts of the score, adding to its intensity. The result is a less refined but fresher and more intense score, perfectly suited for a newer generation of film music fans. The only problem with the cd is the legnth; we only get about half of the score."
4,A Pretty good Adaptation!,"Bernard Herrmann create one of the best score ever made. The only man that could adapting this score are Danny Elfman. The interpretation are very good whit a small touch of Elfman's style espacially in track #1 ''Intro/logos'' But we didn't have the complete score int this album. WHY? Some of the best adaptation passages, present in the film, are MISSING... Overall, it's a good ''Hommage'' to Bernard Herrmann's masterpiece; and more better than the precedent album song (Music inspired by the Motion Picture soundtrack)."
3,As good as the original,"For those people who liked EverQuest, Kunark is as good as the original. The lizardman is a great addition. The graphics are excellent, and the land is massive, so there are a lot more areas to explore.The only big problem I had with this expansion is the trouble that Verant/Sony had in distributing copies of the expansion to people who owned the original. It did not get out when expected. However, Verant/Sony provided quick and adequate restitution."
1,DONT BOTHER!,"This was a game with great potential, but the company that runs it is a complete waste of a buisness licence!Thier idea of customer service is "" the players are always lieing, and trying to cheat, so never believe them!""You think im joking? check out thiere web sights some time!The game is EXTREEMLY static! nothing ever changes, and the same creature drops the same loot all the time! so everyone lines up to kill the monsters with the best loot, and you somtimes have to wait literslly DAYS to get somthing you are after!The servers are overcrowded, and there are almost no differences between the player races beside the apperance! a gnome warrior hits just as hard as a troll warrior of the same lvl!Grouping is FORCED at higher levels, and contrary to what the book says, soloing is NOT supported!Wait for Neverwinter Nights, or Shadowsband. or better yet horizon! all of thiese games are due out in the next year or so, and when they hit the market, EQ will dry up like an stale loaf of bread!"
1,Stay away from this game!,"All this game is constant fight, med, fight, med, fight, med. You literally spend 90% of your time sitting doing absolutely nothing (mostly meditating to regain your health). You do the same thing over and over and over and over.Verant also has VERY poor customer support. They do not listen to their customers, and they will literally ban you because you say something negative about them on their message board. I know because they have banned/suspended me because I said something negative about them.Even the graphics of this game are outdated by todays standards. The game is literally a waste of time."
1,A great crappy game.,"If and when you can play this game it is awesome. Plan to spend literally forever and all your time to even get anywhere in the game. Moving up levels take A LOT of time.Despite how great the game is, it is an online game which you cannot play if you cannot connect to their servers. Their servers are down at least 1/3 of the time. That's about 8 hours in a 24 hour period. I've tried playing the game 7am, 10am, noon, 2-3pm, 6-9pm and never could connect because they are performing maintenance. Perhaps I have bad timing... but this was in a one week period. They have absolutely NO SENSE when to conduct maintenance and updates. I suppose their system is always up and running 3-4am in the morning for some of those 'unique' people.If you don't want to waste your time playing the game and waiting to play the game, pass this and choose something else."
2,Two comments,"Great graphics, poor customer service, bugs are minimal considering the vastness of the game, but assistance can be sketchy if you are hindered by one.This game is NOT the high fantasy setting many AD&D players are used to. However, it does offer an alternative to Quake and the like. Gameplay has a free-will feel. You are left to wander the world and do as you please. Participation in ""events"" is optional.Communications from company to customer have been poor to date, though they are improving slowly. Again, I cannot express enough the lack of quality customer service from this company."
4,OK people so it has a few bugs,"This is a good expansion for everquest. I say good because it does limit the lower level characters for adventuring in it unless you are an Iksar and some do get some drag from video glitches but all in all for those that are high enough level it is a well needed expansion. It gives higher levels an added challenge that other games do not and it does not end so there is no ""ok so I finished it, what now"". Another aspect is it gives people a chance to meet other people from around the world without even going to the country they are in. Some may also say ""What about the cost per month?"" Ok, think about this. How much does it cost to go out on the town for ONE night a month? You can't do it for even $10.00 A NIGHT, let alone a month! The whole key to this game is to make friends and have fun. I recomend this game for people who want to save money and meet people from around the world ... not the power gamer types."
1,When you buy a game...,"...you in effect, buy the company behind it. And to be frank, these people seem to take great joy in abusing their customers. The game really has AMAZING potential, I just don't think it will ever realize that potential with the current crew at the helm. The friends you make online might keep you playing tho (which is what happened to many of us). If you don't already have EQ, I wouldn't spend the money on this expansion... wait a few months for some of the other MMORPG's that are coming down the pike. Verant has left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I won't be buying the Star Wars MMORPG that Lucas has teamed with them to make. NEVER another Verant game... EVER."
1,"If developers want to know what NOT to do, play this game.","Why, the lag, steep system requirements, and bad gameplay, and the fact that the gameplay is outdated and uncomprimising, makeing you play in one way, and that way ain't good. What way is that? The sit and kill way. Thats all you do. Fans will argue that its deeper than that, but that isn't true. Thats all you do, theres no reason to roleplay or do anything usefull. Besides the crapy gameplay the game suffers alot of other problems, the lag is one, when I played it was really bad, nearly everywhere. I never had anyfun when my game was running at one frame per second! Anyways, if you want a good, solid roleplaying experiance play Ultima Online, if you want an outdated (by ten years!!) game masked by pretty graphics, go ahead get on the Everquest band wagon."
2,"Addictive, Fun ...BUT","A highly addictive game, which can be played with whatever suits your role playing philosophy.BUT... the very company that brings you this immersive world is so immersed in its only development cycle that it does not allow you to play or seem to respond to the deep customer dissatisfaction.Constant server downtime for long periods ( 6 to 8 hours many times ) to make minor changes. Impossible to reach tech support or customer service. Several spokespersons who respond to complaints on message boards with the almost literal 'well that's the way it is, so forget about your complaints'. Even with the release of this upgrade, a fiasco occured where many people did not get the upgrade after weeks of waiting and having paid for overnight delivery. The kind of human, public-relation errors could be listed forever in this everquest to be allowed to play and enjoy this game."
4,good but not great,"Everquest is one of the best rpg multiplayer games i have ever seen the only problem i have with it is that it can get very confusing to a first time player and the game is kinda difficult to understand, other than that i think its a great game. buy this if you know that you'll think you can understand it and put lots of time into it."
5,"IF YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR JOB, BUY THIS GAME","This is the most addictive game ever. The graphics are wonderful, there are so many things do do and places to go in this game. My friends and I have lost so much sleep while playing this game, because you CANT STOP. However you need to pay a 10$ monthy fee with your credit card if you want to play. But, nonetheless this game is a MUST BUY."
5,Great Online Fantasy,"I dont know why ppl are upset with this game. It's not the game that has ppl upset its the customer service or thier veiw of it. Sure they are having a few problems with some customer service issues, but they are dealing with them. Ive played this game over a year now and although i dont have a character over lvl 10 yet its because i have several characters on several servers that I am tring to keep up with. The point of this game is not really just killing this monster or that monster its getting to know new ppl and making friends and having fun with them. Those that are getting banned on the message board or from the game are banned because they could not keep to the agreement and keep foul language out of the experiance."
2,EQ RULES,THIS GAME RULES YOU HAVE SO MUCH YOU CAN DO IN THE GAME AND YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME FOREVER BECAUAUSE YOU NEVER CAN BEAT THE GAME. THE BAD THING IS THAT THER IS NO SINGLE PLAYER ONLEY MPLAYER.
4,"It's fun, but not perfect.","I bought this game with no real idea of how much fun it might be. I have been playing for a good while now, and I think its one of the best games I have ever played, not too mention the most addictive. I love RPG's, and playing with other people is so much fun for me. It does have its own problems though. Some areas become super crowded with players, and after you die you start off at your home city, and should you die in some far off land, then it takes for ever to get your corpse. But other then those problems, this game is really worth trying. All the different races (dwarves, humans, barbarians, trolls, elves, etc.), all the different classes (warriors, paladins, mages), it is so great! I recommend this to anyone who wants to try it."
1,Great potential but...,The whole game centers around collecting items by sitting and waiting 8-10 hours at a time in line with other players who want the same item from a rare creature that may appear once in a week.The game has lots of potential but this focus of the game ruins any potetntial for roleplaying or strategy. It consists of lots of boring sitting and waitin for rare creatures to spawn and squabling with other players so you can get your character the best items. There dont seem to be any other goals in the game.It could be a lot of fun if a comapany that had half a clue about gameplay and fun took over management of the game.This will never happen so it will never be.
1,AVOID!,"This game cannot be called an RPG. No one roleplays. The whole point of it is to kill and get stuff. There is no storyline at all. Period.Oh yeah. As if it gets any worse, its addictive too."
4,Fun but...,"The great thing about Everquest is the fact that you can comonicate with others, and make partys. EQ has a great amount of races and occupations that you can be, and many contanents to explore.It also has an original attack system. So why only 4 stars? First of all this is an expansive game in which you pay a monthly fee. Second, by now the graphics are very last year. And finally, many people call this the most addictive gamme ever, I personally get very bord after playing for an hour. Do not get me wrong this game is fun. But I just do not think it is worth the price."
5,The Best Game If You Have Time,"it is a great game, amazingly fun, and has thousands of quests to do. I love it, but it takes some time. It can be the funnest thing in your life, as it is as addictive as chocolate."
5,Everquest:Ruins of Kunark,"Everquest is the best online game out there, and with the new expansion players will get visually stunning grapihics, a whole new race, and a brand new continet."
5,Totally depends on you,"I've heard people say it's addicting and boring. Well, I play about 2 to 3 hours every week. I'm not addicted, I enjoy it however I'm still low level. I'm just saying that if you let it addict you it will, if you don't, it won't. What's all this talk about too expensive? I have a great system. My brother and I split the money to pay because we both play. However, you can get addicted if you let it. My brother is addicted, just don't let it happen to you! I love this game but I don't let it take over me. This is a great game because it isn't boring if your a spellcaster in my opinion. If you're considering buying this game, think about yourself. If you're playing with someone else, the price won't be bad, solo however it will be. Low levels have fun however. I'm having a blast with my level 3! It's you who makes the decision. Just go out and have some fun. Oh, by the way, it doesn't take away your social life if you let it."
1,RavenWarrior of Prexus,"Let me start by saying this: Hello, my name is RavenWarrior, and I'm a RPG addict. Now that this is said, I'm officially kicking the EQ ""habit"". Which is exactly how EQ is tailored. It has the necessary ""hooks"" to keep you coming back for more, while taking your money and offering very little in return. The online gaming community in EQ is neither supportive, nor friendly......heck, I got yelled at for saying good morning to someone in ooc ""out of character"" chat. And, this isn't about Role Playing. This is about Leveling. Which makes one wonder why they call it EverQuest. It should be called Everlag, Everlevel, Evergripe.......you get my point. Trust me, from one RPG fanatic to another......Kick the habit before you lose too much more money."
1,do NOT buy this game as a gift!,"Don't buy this game (the orginal or any add-ons) as a gift to anyone you truly care about. This game is addictive and time-consuming, and it can destroy people's lives, relationships and careers. Ulimately it is an empty time-waster designed to make money at the expense of people's time, exploiting human tendencies to egoism and procrastination. Verant make money from monthly subscriptions to the game, so it is in their interests to make it compulsive. The game is designed so that you will not enjoy it unless you spend substantial amounts of time playing. There are people who play up to 18 hours a day 7 days a week, which doesn't leave much time for Real Life. You have been warned!"
2,Poor Customer Service and Waste of time,I have found that this game becomes a waste of time and very bid source of frustration. servers have been down just about everyday and they still have yet to fix some of the origanal problems in the Everquest but insist on releasing an expansion just to cause more problems. Thanks
5,Pristine sound quality,"I echo the sentiments and praise the other reviewers accord this disc. This recording is intelligent, provocative and engrossing. It is a successful and entertaining marriage of jazz and middle-eastern music. I want to comment specifically about the quality of the sound. It is wonderful; I listen to it on a car stereo and it sounds great, really clear and clean."
5,MUSIC BY A FAVORITE COMPOSER,"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL CD WITH ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMPOSER.CLEAR SOUND, EXCELLENT RENDITION OF THE PIECE."
1,Horrible edition,"Sometimes getting a Dover Edition can be a godsend. They're cheap, well-built, and often reproductions of good editions.But this isn't one of those times. The print is small and the pages are tiny. It does not stay open well at the piano. To be sure, the actual notes are most probably the same as any other, more expensive edition. Nevertheless, most good editions offer large pages and clear, good-sized notation. I suggest the pricier Henle or Peters editions.As a study score, this is certainly a good choice. But to learn an entire rhapsody from it? I neither feel like squinting nor constantly forcing the book to stay open."
2,"Too loud, no volume control","I have a 2 year old who I thought this would be perfect for. She likes soothing things to help her go to sleep. But this is not soothing. It is so loud that she can't fall asleep to it and there is no way to lower the volume. I suppose if I hooked an mp3 player up to it that I could adjust the volume on the mp3 player itself, but haven't tried it yet.She rarely uses it (just when she and her sister are playing house).Oh and it makes a whirring and clicking sound as the scene moves. Real annoying."
2,Wish this fit the crib!!,"As a consumer has already stated, this product does not fit thick railed cribs. My 12 week old son loves the songs and finds the animation of the screen soothing, but I need to supervise his useage of it as I do not feel comfortable with only the battery pack securing it to the crib. Total bummer as we do love it besides that!"
3,Enjoyable,"As many Lebron Brothers fans know, they made some of the best latin music out there. They also liked to record anglo music such as boogaloo, which was the craze during that era. This album has both; as the title ""I Believe"" suggests, there less salsa tracks (4) than anglo tracks. I have to say the title track is rather good, even though I am not a fan at all of this music genre. It should be known that the few latin tracks are really smokin'. ""Solita"" and best of all ""Lo Tuyo Llegara"" are this album's gems. I recommend you grab their greatest hit album ""Lo Mejor"" that includes these 2 tracks and many other tracks that are much better. 2 and half stars for Lebron Brothers on this production."
1,Surprise! The Civil War had something to do with slavery!,"The title sounds more provocative than the book actually is. No doubt it may lead a few people to a more up to date interpretation of the civil war era than they are used to.The most valuable aspect of the book are the annotated bibliographies following each chapter, which will be great for sophmore in college looking for a book list at 3 AM.Some readers of this book may be surprised to discover the war had something to do with slavery. Outside of the slavery issue, the author rarely spends much ink on other topics of the war or reconstruction-he barely touches on reconstruction at all, though this is supposed to be one of the points of the book.Pick it up at the library for the bibliographies, find an area of interest, grab a real book, then read on."
2,Second Rate Historian Tries to Re-Write the Civil War,"An economic interpretation of the Civil War and anti-Lincoln that is the main points of this book and why this book is off, way off. Hummel's writng is not too bad and the bibliographic essays at the end of each chapter are interesting. However, his history is off as is most revisionist history. The causes of the Civil War were not economic and the results of the Civil War is not big government. Hummels writing seems to be a sort of justification for his personal political views. One is much better off reading Foote, Fields, or Catton"
5,wow,"this is one of the best i've heard. check out I CAN'T STAND IT or system F's own OUT OF THE BLUE smash hit and you'll know what I'm talkin about. Great uplifting energy from song to song, mixed smoothly by ferry corsten. U can't go wrong with this one"
5,Bumed Out!,"Why didn't i get this CD when it first came out! I like this CD alot, after hearing it from my cousin. I can't find this CD anywhere....so if any of you are willing to sell yours, let me know. I don't buy burned copies...only originals!"
5,My dad gave me this book,because he says SMOKING IS BAD...And I saw it in the story...Poeple almost died !and the story is so good. The children were very brave !I loved it..
2,Pilates Exercises for Osteoporosis,"The quality of the recording is very poor, and the pace of the exercises themselves is too slow. I am disappointed with this purchase."
1,Boring!,"This was the most boring!exercise dvd I have everseen. I showed it to myPilates instructor and shecouldn't even make it throughthe first five minutes. Theoutfit was hideous, likesomeone wearing a diaper, andit was extremely slow paced.Probably good for my great-grandma!"
4,Portico Birmingham Magazine,"From our local publisher, Menasha Ridge Press, this is a welcome book for all nature-lovers in Birmingham. You'll find rural and urban hikes, wildlife hikes, historic hikes and more. There are ample illustrations and the book is attractive enough to lure you out of the house to get out and make use of the great weather we enjoy neary year-round (the dog-days of July and August not included)."
4,Great Hikes,"This books does have some great hikes around Birmingham. I'm sure to find 60 hikes, some had to be very easy and not really what I would classify as a hike. But overall a great book!"
1,Total Junk,"Is there a way to give zero stars!Received item in sealed container, but ...There was some kind of nasty film all over the outside of the receiver.Did it work? No, the transmitter failed to link up with the receiver. Called for service and they gave me an RMA number. Sent it back on my nickle only to have it returned 2 weeks later, supposedly tested, supposedly a new unit, still not working, same nasty film (different unit so the film must be a feature), and missing a few parts at that.A total writeoff.BTW, the tech on the phone confirmed that they reship repaired units as new. Not my words, his. So it isn't Amazon's fault."
4,Works!,"I'm fairly happy with this device, use it to play a radio station on the computer out on my back porch. Goes through 2 walls about 20 ft away and works great, haven't had any major problems. Took a few minute to set it up, but that's a given."
2,bad packaging,"Received my order promptly, but packaging was bad. The two boxes of staples were shipped in one larger box. The larger box was ripped open on one end. The two boxes of staples inside the open box had the ends ripped off of them. Some of the cartridges of staples had staples missing with loose staples in the larger box, so I had many staples that just could not be used. I thought about returning the items but needed to finish an upholstery job, so decided to keep what was usable and chalk it up for a bad experience. I probably won't order from this source in the future."
2,Poor,"The surebonder staple gun had rust on it and the staples that were order with it don'tfit.The is the first item, that I have gotten fom Amazon that I haven't been pleasedwith."
2,So you're an AC/DC fan...,"Made in UK in 1999, Serial# CD-6190, Playing Time 47:06Back in the first half of the 70's, Brian Johnson appeared on numerous singles and the first 3 Geordie albums.This compilation lifts tracks from many singles, as well as Geordie's albums up to 1976's ""Save The World"". The voice is, of course, easily recognizable. There are more compilations of this band than they have albums, so making a choice is difficult (unless you buy them all...), and getting the ""regular"" albums leaves you short of many tracks only released as singles.I found this disc to be second-best, still short of ""A Band From Geordieland"", which has 24 tracks, and about 30 minutes more of music."
1,Sander seized up after 4 hours use,"I bought the sander about a year ago but hadn't used it much until recently. The motor is evidently seized up and I'm not sure if I have any time left on the warranty. I bought four boxes of sandpaper for this sander, but will not buy another Porter Cable tool. I only hope my PC biscuit jointer and nail guns don't suffer the fate of this poorly built tool."
2,Performed well... while it worked -,"This sander has been in my shop for about a year and a half with minimal use - probably less than three hours of total sanding time. Even though I was diligent in blowing out the dust with an air hose and using the sander as recommended, the bearings seized-up last weekend. A real shame because when it worked, it worked very well with flawless results. It's definitely not up to the quality standards of the Porter Cable we used to know and trust."
1,"Porter-Cable 333K 5"" Random Orbit Sander",I would not buy another one of these sanders. After about 3 hours of total use the lower bearing seized. Their web site sells the bearing for $12.60.
3,Ball bearing split/motor rebuilt after only 3 sanding jobs,"I initially bought this sander because I wanted something more durable than Black and Decker but didn't want to pay significantly more for a Dewalt. My mistake. Just got my sander back from a local Porter and Cable repair center. They had to repack the ball bearings and completly rebuild the motor. This is a light duty sander and we've only used it for 3 jobs. It may be a fluke, but after paying 1/2 the purchase price to have it repaired so soon, I can't give it more than 3 stars for durability. I give it 5 stars for performance, though, it really does a great job of sanding without leaving tell-tale marks on the wood finish.Overall, I give it a 3. I guess I should have paid the extra $$ up front."
4,Sander vs. plastic,"This is the second Porter Cable model 333K sander we purchased. The first one was damaged when it got too close to plastic sheeting and sucked it in. I did buy replacement parts, but they didn't hold up as well as the original. Thus the four stars. It is a very good sander and would have received five stars if not for the ease at which it could be damaged by something that is not uncommon to a sanding area. Depending on the paper you use it can really hog out the wood or do excellent fine work."
5,It'll capture your heart and soul!,Tim McGraw does it again! Please Remember Me captures your heart and soul with its captivating and tenderly romantic melody and lyrics. Don't wait! Order ASAP! Take my word for it; I know you'll love it as much as I did! : )
4,You'll love every song,Can't get enough of Tim Mcgraw's music.Ionly put this 2nd to set the circus down.It is worth its weight and gold.I'd buy.
1,This album is the worst effort from Tim by far!,"I love Tim McGraw, but this album is horrible. He changed so much and for the worst. I love his last 3 albums, but this is a waste of money. I hope this doesn't effect Faith's next album."
5,YOU ARE A HUNK OF BURNING HOT LOVE!,Tim you can sing about cleaning the toilet or clipping your toe nails and you would still be hot! What a sexy stud puppy......Too bad your straight.
2,Sappy!,"I really enjoyed Tim's earlier stuff, but this CD seems to be the trend in country ""pop"" music. It will sell, but has no heart.This will be the last CD that Tim does anything with because there is a new trend heading in the direction of the old honky tonk story tellers whose concern was more the music and less about how will it look on video. Faith Hill is the same way. She just does a better job of keeping her CD's lively and sappy!"
4,"Tim McGraw's ""Place in the Sun"" is a must buy.","I'm not the type of person you usually expect or find listing to Country music. The music is well written, harmonic and melodic. I really enjoy it, it's soothing, calming music. Tim has come a long way. I predict that there will be many songs from this CD to hit some of the Top 10 lists. It's pretty good, I give it 4 stars. :^)"
2,Something Like that...,"I love the song Something Like That..Actually..I don't love it. It's ok. The problem with country today is that it lacks depth. Taking a look around the country industry you'll see that it's the most placated and perversed genre. The big labels have taken advantage of the listener and produced album after album that sounds exactly alike. Tim McGraw has a good voice..yes. The fact remains that he doesn't really write most of his own stuff. If you wanna here some country that has real value check out: Charlie Daniels Band, Conway Twitty, Hank Williams, and today's best stuff Phil Vassar, Alabama, Garth Brooks, and Brooks and Dunn. If you want other music that will truly leave you reeling check out Pedro The Lion, Bright Eyes, Modest Mouse, Burning Airlines, Braid (RIP), and Texas Is The Reason. Thank you."
4,My Best Friend,"This is one of the best songs he has written...It explains the way I feel about my boyfriend to a ""T"" ! It will be played at our wedding!"
5,Just what I excepted from Tim McGraw!,"I love anything this man does. His music tells what life is really all about. This album sounds a little different than usual, but I like it. Some of his songs are just ""FUN SONGS"". My favorite of all Tim's songs are: ""Where the Green Grass Grows"". That song is about me. I moved away from the South to the North and someday hope to go back. My daughter loves it too."
5,Tim Hits Another Home Run,"Tim McGraw's ""A Place In The Sun"" contains an excellent variety of his music. If you purchase any Tim McGraw CD, it has to be this one. Tim just keeps getting better all the time."
5,Tim Mcgraw is great,"I purchased A Place In The Sun a few weeks ago and it is terrific as are all of Tim Mcgraws CD's. My favorite song on the CD is My Best Freind. It touches my heart every time I hear it. On Dec 3rd, 1999 I seen Tim Mcgraw in concert in Atlantic City for the second time. He is wonderful to see in concert an excellent entertainer. He sounds no different live then he does on CD. I hope he continues the great work and comes out with another album soon."
5,"""A Place In The Sun"" is the next hit album for Tim McGraw!!","Having all of Tim McGraw's albums, this new album shows how he has grown and matured since he first appeared on the scene. The album has a lot of great songs with a lot of meaning about life and love. I highly recommend it to anyone that is a Tim McGraw fan!"
3,"COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, NOT YOUR TYPICAL TIM MCGRAW",NOT YOUR AVERAGE TIM MCGRAW ALBUM! I REALLY APPRECIATE RODNEY CROWELL'S REMAKE!
1,Not impressed,"I love Tim McGraw and think he's one of the best singers in Country, he always sings with such feeling. But this album is. . . boring. No catchy hooks, words are kind of sappy and it seems that a bit of Tim's fire has been burned out. Some songs kind of stand out but I have no desire whatsoever to listen to a single one again. In fact, some songs are irritating. I surely hope the problem is me and lots of others will find this album appealing."
4,pure love,"I might be wrong but this cd means alot to any one who is in love.In fact the song ""my best friend "" is going to be played at my wedding as we light our unity candle. This is an excellent selection for anyone who wants to say they didn't waste their money."
5,"great songs, great singer, great music!!!!!!!",i listened to this and thought: wow!!!!!!! i'm getting this one a.s.a.p.!!!!! i loved Everywhere and this is just as good!!!!! tim rulz!!!!!
5,The best ever!!!!!!!!,"Almost everyone who has reviewed this cd has said it, but I want to state that Tim McGraw's new cd is awesome!! The instrumentation is some of the best I've ever heard but that's not why I bought it. ""Please Remember Me"" touches your soul like no other song can during these times. Unlike ""Everywhere"" this cd has several ballads that compete with ""Don't take the girl"" and ""Not a moment too soon"". Everyone can relate to ""My best friend"" and ""something like that"" will have you dancing. If you like ""please remember me"" then go buy this cd today, you will not be dissappointed."
2,A Place in the Trash,"Out of all the country singers in Nashville, Tim McGraw would be one of last ones I thought would turn ""Pop"" country. Well, he did on this album. Although it has its bright spots, A Place in the Sun is mainly sappy and regular. Not A Moment Too Soon and Everywhere have much more heart in them and have country ballads in them. You can also tell because Tim produced Jo Dee Messina's new CD, which totally stinks. Tim needs to stick to traditional country, because that's where he's at his best."
5,ONE OFF HIS BEST ALBUMS,TIM IS ALWAYS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER A PLACE IN THE SUN JUST SHOWS HOW BETTER HE GET'S EVERYTIME A NEW ALBUM COMES OUT.TIM IS MY FAVORITE OVER ANY OTHER COUNTRY SINGER I BUY EVERYTHING OF HIS I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE STATE TO SEE HIM AND I LIVE IN NY. MALIA
2,broke on first use,the mandrel/drill bit part of this broke the first day.Wasn't worth the hassle to return. Great product to buy if youre looking to waste money.
1,NON-drip it Pro Green,"I was so excited about this product. I had just planted some tomatoes in a patio container and we had to leave for 3 weeks to help our daughter after surgery. I got the product right on time, read the instructions, put it together with the wick in and water up to the mark, then put it in my plant with all the confidence in the world. When we came home, the plant was dead and the Drip-it Pro Green still had the exact amount of water in it as when we left. I was very disappointed. I cannot recommend this product."
1,poorly made and unreliable,"I bought a set of two of these. I set them up for a trial run before my vacation, and only one of the two dispensed water, the other didn't work. When it came time for the trip, I set them both up to water the same pot, hoping at least one of them would work, but came back home to discover that neither one of them dispensed any water, and my plant was dead. I would recommend not to trust your plants to these. I wish I hadn't."
3,Doesn't seem to deliver enough water,"I purchased two Drip-It Pro units and tried them with 4 different medium-sized plants. I noticed after a few days that water level wasn't going down much at all, with both wicks installed. 2 of the plants showed signs of needing water after a week. Maybe I am not using them with the right plant types."
4,Interesting little book,"This interesting little book uses very simple but effective line drawings instead of photo sequences to teach self-defense. The technique is wrestling- and grappling-oriented, but that's okay. The book presents a lot of different scenarios, and as a wrestling-based approach to self-defense, I thought this book wasn't too bad, in fact, it's pretty good. Wrestling as a self-defense art is under-valued, and there is no doubt it is an effective method in its own right.If I recall right, as it's been 30 years since I've seen the book, Hepler had a twin brother who he used to work out wrestling and self-defense techniques.Anyway, this was a fun little book with an interesting slant. The only other book I know like it that was totally based on line-drawings was the Ratti brothers' Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere, another excellent example of this sort of approach."
4,Drumming it good.,"The cover art and album title should tell you that this album is no salsa. Although it's not salsa, it does have very good Latin jazz and African. I have always thought latin jazz suit him better even though he has created salsa masterpieces. I see him more as a free player and this album displays those skills very well. Abidjan and Drum Poem are the standouts for me because of the African sounds and chants. My only problem is that it is has around 32 minutes of music on only 5 tracks."
2,disapointing,"I love Abnett's books. Really. But sadly this is more int he childish silly 'demons bursting out of everyone all the time with guts flopping about"" style one expects from a GW spin off. Save yuor money and buy all his other stuff."
2,this is not Dee Dee,"This project is quite interesting, and we find Dee Dee searching for her roots, putting them into the music we have on this album; but Dee Dee is a pure jazz artist, since the 70's; in all her past albums (and even in her last one, in tribute to Billie Holiday), she offers excellent interpretations of jazz standards, or even new songs but with a total jazz approach; in ""Red earth"" she does something totally different, different from what people usually search for in Dee Dee albums.I can't listen to Dee Dee singing these songs, it's not her music."
4,Textbook for class.,"The book is interesting but it's starting to show signs of it's age. I think the last revision of it was 2001, so the examples are good, yet aged. It would be great if they updated it. Still a useful and good book though."
5,Satisfied,We received the wrong iyem. were credited immediately and got a replacement in less time than promised. Amazon is always a delight to deal with
1,false advertising,this isn't even the right cable...does not even fit the camera...wasted my money....and just try and figure out how to return it...no clear instructions whatsoever
2,wrong one,Did not fit camera I ordered it for. Was not your fault. It was what I ordered but my owners manuel was wrong . It said this was what I needed and it was not.
2,Cable,"It did not work on my camera at all as was indicated in the description, but the price was right!"
2,Okay,It doesnt do what I expected it to do. But it was a great price. I need to know that had audio/video download. but the description didnt mention it.
1,"Poor description, snotty response I will never buy from them again","The product description (Olympus CB-USB7 USB Download cable for the Olympus FE series Digital Cameras)is misleading. It implies that the cable works for ALL Olympus FE Series Digital cameras. It does not fit the FE-210 which is what I have. When I explained that the cable does not work for my camera, I was told ""You ordered the wrong cord. This cable is replacement USB cable for select Olympus cameras only.Please double check your user manual.""Now I am out the cost of the item and shipping, got attitude from cablemart, the company that took my money and gave me nothing I could use in return. I will never buy from these people ever again."
5,A Gem Of American Music,"Leroy Anderson is certainly one of the memorable and popular of American light music composer and this CD of his music really shines with the strains of the St Louis Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Leonard Slatkin. Simply magical. Mr Slatkin plays the music as close as Leroy Anderson intended to and not distorted any arrangements of the music. The album opens with the opulent 'Belle Of The Ball' and it waltzes ever so beautifully in digital stereo and sweeps you to an imaginary ballroom and completely swoons you. The ever popular seasonal piece 'Sleigh Ride' is stil a delight with the young at heart. The other titles in this superb CD are the immortal 'Blue Tango', the serene 'Serenata', the dreamy 'Forgotten Dreams' and the title track of the CD, the playful 'The Typewriter'. Though this album can't compare to the original Leroy Anderson albums and the evergreen Boston Pops with Arthur Fieldler, it is a fitting tribute to a gem in music that is Leroy Anderson."
1,Do not buy,This is very very difficult to use. I have been trying to burn a DVD for several days with no luck. This is just impossible to use.
1,Will not copy standard length movies,I have owned this software for a number of years and it used to work fine when movies took up less space on DVD...but now all movies contain more info than will fit on standard blank DVD. So you spend all this time doing a read of the movie DVD and then you put in your blank and the program fills the blank to capacity and you get a message that there is not enough space on your blank...this is After it has written to your blank and basically ruined it....there must be a way around this (like the option to use 2 blanks) but the software does not offer it. I have searched online but have not come up with a solution.
5,Very sensible and useful bread book.,"I live in Philadelphia and thoroughly enjoy this bakery's breads so I was looking forward to seeing if their bread book would help me duplicate some of my favorite of their breads. It is well written and sensible without so much science as to overwhelm the reader. The recipes and instructions are clear. I think it is going to take me a good while to truly duplicate their breads, but they seem to be willing to give me guidance in doing just that."
3,Great replacement mouse for the Mac.,"So far this is a great replacement for the standard Mac mouse (which quit working properly the first month I got it. Work great. Only drawback is that it is bluetooth connection and whenever you shut down the computer, it looses the connection. This requires a repairing. Problem is, you need the mouse to set up the repairing. I had to reconnect old mouse to do. This is a problem."
4,"Works Great, But....","This mouse tracks very well. It's awesome that way. It's comfortable too. The only complaint I would have is that the ""hatch"" where the batteries are stored, comes undone occasionally."
3,Good Mouse But Tiring to Use for Extended Periods,"Two flaws prevent this from being a great product. 1. The slant is backwards forcing your wrist to remain in an unnatural position while using the mouse and causes cramps. 2. The battery door is opened by pressing the back sides of the mouse, which I press by accident often. And yes you guessed it the batteries fall out and I am left scrambling to pick up the batteries. I am an admitted klutz, which turns this mouse into a booby trap in my hands."
4,Great Mouse,"I fought with a Kensington Pilot Mouse for months. It was jumpy, hard to use, and wouldn't automatically reconnect if I restarted my imac. I was about to abandon Kensington and then I read reviews for the Si670m and went ahead and ordered one. Am I glad I did. What a difference!"
4,small,Mouse works perfectly with my Macbook Pro.It is small. I have small hands and didn't think i would find it uncomfortable after a period of time but i do. It's a bit too narrow. It's a great portable mouse but i wish i had bought the wireless Mighty Mouse. I use a wired Mighty Mouse at work and i am now addicted to the little ball on it that moves left and right. I wish this mouse had that feature and was a bit wider.
2,Nice while it lasted,"Used with a MacBook Pro. I liked this mouse until, after only 3 months, the clicking became unreliable. Now, I often have to click 2 or 3 times to get the click to take. This drives me crazy so I switched back to my clunky old Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer bluetooth mouse which I have had for years."
2,Only good for small hands,"A lot is good about this mouse, but it has a major design flaw. In order to use the scroll wheel, you have to move your hand back a bit. The mouse is already short and this then causes the mouse to be under your fingers but not under any part of your hand. As a result, you can't really rest your hand on the mouse and that is less than comfortable. I guess, if you had small hands, this wouldn't be a problem. My hands are average for a tall guy and I haven't experienced this problem with any other mice. If you're just looking for a laptop mouse for shorter uses - or if you very small hands, this one may be for you. Because everything else works pretty well. (Kensington could avoid this problem by moving the scroll wheel to the tip of the mouse.)"
2,"Good functioning Mouse, but flawed design.","The mouse works really well, however the door for accessing the batteries is poorly designed and will break easily over time, when you have to switch batteries in and out, like mine did. The tabs that hold it closed weaken causing the door to pop open while in use and if you are gaming, it will be a big problem. After about a year of use the scroll wheel finally died as well which I have never encountered b4 with a mouse."
2,Getting frustrated,"As far as the bluetooth pairing and the tracking quality, I have to give this mouse a ""two-thumbs up"". I am currently using this mouse with a Macbook Pro and the Mac has no trouble finding the mouse when I turn it on.The down side is the poor design of the battery compartment. The very action of slightly squeezing the sides of the mouse releases the battery door. The design is such that the contact springs for the batter are perpetually working against the retention mechanism! there is no way of adjusting the retention strength as the barbs are simply injection molded plastic.I am a designer and I find that using this mouse for a full day of work requires reassembly on the order of 10-20 times a day. I will be looking for another mouse..."
4,Great Mouse but...,"I've been using this mouse for a few weeks now and find it very very good with two exceptions. The first is if one is not careful the back end ""hatch"" where the batteries go opens a little too easily if you squeeze the back of the mouse to hard, causing the batteries to pop out and therefore losing your bluetooth connection temporarily. Secondly on a couple of occasions the mouse has just lost its bluetooth connection and the cursor has frozen on the screen. I'm not sure, yet, if this is the mouses fault or my computer's. Outside of that, I am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it!"
2,A below average bluetooth mouse,"This is my first bluetooth mouse. It's known bluetooth mouse associates with your computer slower than USB wireless mouse. But I don't like the dongle, so here it goes.Okayed with the Kensington Si670m until I purchased a Logitech V470. Now I realized bluetooth mouse does not necessarily connect to computer slower.Overall I would rate the Kensington 3 stars. But minus 1 star thanks to the battery cover. It's so easy to get loose. Almost every time I touch the off-on switch it breaks loose, very annoying."
3,Performance undone by some dodgy design,"Wireless performance-wise, one of the best I've used. However, panel for battery insertion popped open far too frequently. Over time, simply wouldn't close any more. I'd expected an item like this to be usable for much longer than it did. Price, therefore, not a steal; merely decent."
4,Great mouse for Mac and PC,"I use this mouse mostly with my Macbook when travelling, but also on myLenovo T60 Thinkpad which I also have with me all the time. I run it onSnow Leopard, Windows XP Pro, and Linux (Ubuntu 9.04) on a regular basis.Still on the same battery as when I bought it (7 months ago) and stillworks just great. My ONLY gripe, if you can call it that, is that thebottom has little rubber rails that are a tad ""sticky"" - for the firstfew months, it didn't work well on a desktop without a mouse pad. Itkind of ""dragged"" because of the rubber rails. But as time wears on, it'sgetting smoother and I really don't notice a problem anymore. VERYwell built - heavy construction (feels heavy even), great ergonomics formy hand. Great bluetooth mouse - I can recommend this."
3,Two Years & It Died,"I've used this exclusively for 2 years because it does not need to use up a USB port. After 2 years of heavy usage, it is now being temperamental and not working on a regular basis-just shutting off, losing connection.I would recommend it, but would prefer that it lasted longer."
2,I hate this mouse!,"It would be a great but the battery hatch does not stay shut! Opens with the slightest bump which makes the mouse lose power and connectivity! So annoying! Now even the tape I have on the mouse to prevent this is no longer holding it shut and I get tape adhesive gunk on my hand all the time. Wish I never bought this, now I am shopping for aNOTHER one! Be advised!"
2,Inconvenient,"I was using an Apple mouse that had erratic scrolling behavior, sometimes it would scroll up and down, other times it would only scroll down. Decided to try the Kensington because of past successes with their other products. This only problem I have with this bluetooth mouse is that it won't run with 1.2v rechargeable batteries; the apple mouse did/does. It just costs too much to be constantly replacing batteries in a mouse. I've returned to the Apple mouse, using rechargeable batteries."
4,Good but nonprogramable,"Just picked this up yesterday for my Macbook Pro. Easy to pair, great to use. On/off feature and auto sleep have eased my worries about battery life.Big upset!: Mouseworks seems not to work with this model. I had hoped to be able to use scroll wheel to browse back/forth rather than scroll horizontally (which does work great, and I'm not sure why not for others (PC?)).If mouseworks was working, 5 stars. But not today..."
3,"Good mouse, but really, really heavy.","I like how this mouse works perfect in mac os... but it's too heavy, and i get tired very soon when using it. Not a good buy if you plan to use your mouse a lot, it will damage your arms... And also, it is big, not good for travel either."
3,Build quality leaves something to be desired,"After a few months, the plastic gliders on the bottom started falling off. Less than a year later, they are all gone. I own several other mice (Logitech & Microsoft) and this is the first time I've had this problem. For the price I paid for this thing, they could have at least used strong enough glue...Other minor annoyances: there is a significant lag to wake up after inactivity. Perhaps this is a ""feature"" of bluetooth, although I have not been able to find any setting to adjust or disable the timeout. On-off button is inconveniently recessed, and of the quality one might expect to find on a $5 kids toy.Despite those gripes, it's a decent mouse. The rubberized feeling take a little getting used to, but is actually a nice feel. Unlike other reviewers, I've never inadvertantly opened the battery compartment. Scroll wheel works well, although the side scrolling requires using Kensington's proprietary drivers, which are crap."
5,Really nice cat with roses Italian charm,"This is a really nice italian charm of a cat surrounded by roses. It is very sweet, with outstanding colors and details. Great price, quality, shipping costs, and delivery."
3,All of Me,Very funny dvd - about the after life. Steve Martin plays the part of a solicitor that become 1/2 possessed by the dead Lily. Very funny to watch and will have you rolling around on the floor in parts.
3,Feel good comedy that's actually funny (occasionly).,"This is that type of movie that has one really hilarious scene and the rest of the movie is only so-so. Steve Martin, whose probably the funniest man alive right now, is delightful as a man with control of half of his body, but Liley Tomlin is downright annoying."
1,"Love Lily Tomlin, but not this time.","I bought this after watching a biography on Steve Martin's career and this was listed as one of his great performances. I always liked Lily Tomlin and thought Steve was a good actor for some crazy parts like The Jerk. But this movie just didn't do it for me, too slapstick."
1,"great movie, terrible DVD","This is a great movie, one of my favs. Unfortunately, the DVD I received appears to be a bootlegged version. The film is grainy, as though someone recorded it off of a VHS tape and then burned that onto a DVD. There are several scenes where a fiber appears on the left side of the screen, and there's a continuous white line on the top border. The audio is subpar, and there are times where there's a split second delay between audio and video. It's a bit surreal, which would be ok if this were a Stanley Kubrick film."
5,The Best American Comedy,"This 1984 Carl Reiner comedy is one of the best film showcases of Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin's sundry talents. Tomlin plays a sickly spinster who is given the chance to transfer her soul to the body of another woman, and thus go on living. But the magic man who is supposed to make this happen goofs up and locks her spirit inside a bachelor lawyer (Martin)--or, more accurately, within the right half of the poor fellow's body. Suddenly, the swinging man-about-town is literally at odds with himself, unable to make a self-determining decision without a huge internal struggle. Martin's physical comedy, always remarkable, is absolutely inspired this time around, as he convincingly portrays a man split down the middle between opposing sensibilities. This is also one of the best films by Reiner, a filmmaker whose novel ideas are sometimes more striking than their execution."
2,Don't Buy It,"The movie, in and of itself, is a good one (4 stars); but the quality of the DVD is amazingly bad. If I had known that it was even possible for a DVD to come out so badly, I wouldn't have bought it. To boot, it's not in widescreen."
5,Funny Movie,We do not watch movies more than once but have watched this a few times over the years. Sill get laughs. Steve Martin and Lilly Tomblin are a hoot! I would call this an oldie but goodie!
4,"Weird, but great!","This is a very funny movie, and I reccomend it to anyone into comedeys. Despite the strange story and even weirder ending, it's a fun movie to watch with friends."
1,scam,"This movie was and is a piece of crap. Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it was a VHS. Yes, I threw it in the garbage because it would have cost me more to send it back than I paid for it.It was a copy! ! ! ! Even the box it was in was a COPY. Beware to everyone who buys from this party."
4,Great read,"Great book, was fun and easy to read, good story and kept your attention, recommend to all. couldnt put it down till it waqs finished."
5,love her!!!,Karen Kingsbury knows how to take daily life and place God there to help you realize you are not the only one to have this experience and you are never completely alone!!!
3,Inconclusive,Up until the last episode it didn't really seem like this series was tapering. Although they make it obvious what becomes on the characters I still didn't really like the way this series ended.
3,Bad Wrap Up to a Great Show,"I was looking forward to seeing how they would wrap up the sixth and final season of Nip/Tuck. I had watched the previous 5 seasons and enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the last season was kind of a let down.Many parts of the last season seemed like they did not try very hard to end the series. Everyone knew the series was ending, but it was almost as though the sixth season was unrelated to the previous 5. The ending developments of characters was annoying and seemed like it was thrown together.While I still enjoyed watching the last 19 episodes, it did not do the series justice."
5,good,not very happy as was charged an extra 14-09 on its arrival here will not be ordering from you again!
3,Season 6 Nip//tuck,"I am also a avid Nip/Tuck fan....perhaps it's the writing and just a little more than crazy plots the show seems to keep up on, but I was sorry to see this season was a bit drab?? Was there another writers strike that I wasn't aware of?? Hopefully, season 7(the final season) will get it together and go out with a BANG!! Come on....I know the show can produce better work than last seasons more than boring plots and I'd love to see it go out with it's fans still caring about the bizzare, crazy and the more than a little extreme characters. Good luck on season 7....but season 6 was quite a disappointment. So fans and new buyers alike just know that although it is something to have for a complete collection of the series....it is definitely not as enjoyable as the other five. *** Stars out of five.....Dr..k."
2,Who are these people?,"I am an avid Nip/Tuck fan and have all the seasons on DVD. I have been really sad that this will be the last season, but after seeing the season premiere, it might be for the best. This was the worse Nip/Tuck episode I have ever seen. Who is this evil Liz and these OLD, tired, worn out doctors? Who is this new actress playing Teddy? Why does Teddy's character go from a mysterious wild child to a woman who wears $150,000 earrings?This episode had hardly any substance... just smidgens of Christian and Liz fighting, Sean having trouble sleeping, Matt not knowing what he wants to do with his life, etc. The tiny bit of drama with Sean and sleeping pills in the last fifteen seconds is nothing compared to Kimber being kidnapped by the Carver, Matt finding out Ava was a man, or Gina being f***ed off a balcony.This episode was nothing like Nip/Tuck normally is, and this time it was not a good thing. I'll watch the whole season, but here's hoping it gets better from here on out."
2,The shark has been jumped.,"I'm only a couple of episodes into season six, and I don't think I'll finish the series. The show has always been over the top, but you always cared about the characters. They have now become unlikeable, it's like enough already. That being said, I did enjoy seasons 1-5, the series just stayed around one season to many."
5,DVD's,"I'm a huge Nip/Tuck fan and bought them all, but I haven't watched them all yet, but they showed up perfect."
4,necessary evil,"If you have cordless tools you gotta have batteries! I have been using De Walt for years. The XR+ do seem to last longer I am a professonal tool user and beat these around the job site everyday I have droped them off ladders bldgs. kicked them around loaned them out you name it they come back for more! I just bought a new one my others are starting to lose the charge a bit to fast but I have had them for 2 years using them in a drill and sawzall. So, like I said they are a necessary evil I recommend having at least 2 or 3 if you are using them on the job site a homeowner could probably get by with 1or 2"
4,firestorm vs dewalt batteries,"I saw numbers that showed the 18V firestorm battery had a 1.5 amp-hour life, while the Dewalt battery had a 2.4 amp-hour life. Possibly a big part of the difference in price between the two battery packs?My batteries lasted about 2 years with medium-to-heavy DIY use."
4,Excellent Performance of the Boston Pops,"This is a very fine collection of recordings of Copland. The performances of Boston with Copland conducting his own music is a sure-fire guarantee you'll hear the music as he intended.The only reason I give this CD 4 stars instead of five is the less than perfect performance of ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" done by Philly under Ormandy and the ""jumpstart"" into Hoedown from Rodeo. The intonation of the brass in the Philly performance is seriously off, and there seems to be no lead-in to ""Hoedown"". Minor problems on an otherwise excellent CD."
4,"Way too much, unless you are a expert","Wow, what a book about preaching. The book is long, detailed, and yes tedious. I was warned before hand concerning the book, thanks Matt, of the nature of the discussion. Buttrick is a master, there is no doubt. He knows every thing and every one concerning preaching. This book is not for the average preacher, most would have no clue what he is talking about, it is mostly theory. This book is beyond me, I am not that good yet to practice this methodology. But the book was helpful in polishing the pulpit. The book is like fine sandpaper, it puts on a beautiful finish on a preacher, but you have to be polished before the paper would do the job. If you are a top notch preacher that needs the most challenging material and style, this book is for you. If not, read ""Preaching"" by Calvin Miller this year."
4,More readable than others,"The New CIO Leader has some insights for current and aspiring CIOs. Its a good book to benchmark where you stand today and what you could do differently.Like every book, you may not agree with everything that the authors have to say; but overall I found it interesting enough to give a few copies to some of my high potential staff.Recommended if you are a CIO or want to be one."
4,"Oh, yummy--with a bit of a kick","I first saw these at my local Whole Foods, and as I am a vegan nut fanatic (they make for great snacking), I had to try them. I love how there are no mysterious ingredients, no preservatives, just wholesome fruit and nuts (with a little sweetener). The Soledad mix has spices that give it a bit of a kick, which is mellowed by the sweeteness of the apples, the brown rice syrup, and the date juice.My only complaint is that when I'm done snacking, many of the flax seeds wind up on the bottom of the bag. Flax is very good for you--an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, but it's hard to eat a handful of tiny seeds.However, if you are looking for a healthy wholesome snack, Sahale's Soledad is a great option."
1,Not so good....,"I LOVE Sahale snacks! Especially the black peppered pistachio/almond/dried cherry mix (which is about impossible to find now)I ordered several different flavors of these snacks recently thru Amazon.This one I can't stomach, though. It reminds me of B.O. (Body Odor)Sounds crude, but it's that bad, in my opinion. I'll continue to buy Sahale brand where ever I can. Top notch products! This one just has a putrid taste to me..."
5,Awesome snack,"Stumbled upon this snack in Charlotte Int'l Airport - Didn't want to have a big lunch, so grabbed a personal size of this pecan mix. I read the label and figured I'd give it a try. Unbelievable snack. The taste was so awesome that I logged onto my laptop in the terminal to email my wife the link so we could find where to buy them. You've got to try this snack. Perfect balance of sweetness and just a little spice to throw you off. Addictive. Just ordered some and cannot wait to receive."
4,Got these in a variety pack....,"These were good. Kinda sweet and salty. There is a very distinct flavor of cumin to me. I am not sure if that is something else causing the flavor, but it is overpowering. These aren't hot spicy, just very flavorful if you like cumin and sweet crystallized fruit, this is for you. If not, get the variety pack from Amazon and try them before you get a 12 pack. This is a very good product as I have tried four flavors and loved them. I just wanted to mention the CUMIN flavor screaming through these. I just don't like cumin a huge huge ton."
5,Exotic & Delicious but Amazon product info needs editing,"Great snacks, but look at the image of the product to see the ingredients. Amazon has errors in the information they're posting; try to see what's in the photo of the product -- the nuts and spices are visible on the package. Amazon has mixed this one up with the description of another from this same line."
3,"slightly stale-tasting, and sometimes tough to chew","I got a good price on these, so I gave them a try, and as a quick snack they're not BAD, but they have a slightly stale flavor (in spite of being nowhere near their 'use by' date), the dried fruit bits tend to be VERY small and hard, and over-all they're blander-tasting than I'd expect, considering the wonderful and flavorful ingredients that went into them.I can eat them for a quick emergency snack, and wouldn't hesitate to offer them to a guest, but I won't re-order."
4,a good mix tape to put you in the right mood,"this is a great EP from a great band. DJ dexta has a true gift for turntablism, and the weird-ass rapping reminds me of why i started liking hip-hop in the first place. 'rock city' is a highlight, almost guaranteed to have you joining in on the whooping."
3,Henny we never knew you,"many of the one-liners should never have seen light of day, however there are some good ones if you look hard enough."
3,Damaged Jacks,"This applies to a purchase made from California Electric Supply.I ordered two white jacks but they sent me one white and one almond. The almond one looks like it's been knocking around in a bin for a long time; the package was all chewed up and the face of the jack was scratched. The jacks themselves work fine, I just don't recommend them if you care about how they look."
1,OVERLY SIMPLISTIC,"First let me say that there are a few good points in this book, but if your looking for a book that will help you understand sex addiction and heal from it,there are much better choices! This book is overly simplistic and incredibly superficial. It's take on sexual addiction, I believe, will only frustrate someone that is looking for legitimate reasons and solutions to problem sexual behaviour.It also trivializes the idea of love.I definitely wouldn't buy this book again."
5,"The best book for demons, devils, and interesting creatures","Here's the most valuable compendium of advanced and extra-planar monsters in existence for AD&D. Gary Gygax's last major contribution to the menagerie includes many old favorites, most of which were expurgated or ""toned down"" in the later, politically correct version of the game. You get dozens upon dozens of demons, devils, undead, demodands, daemons, dragons, giants, and more; if it's evil, and fun to kill, it's here! Lots of classic illustrations, too, far superior to the later Monstrous Manual (bleah!). Find out why it's an eternal DM favorite!"
5,1st Edition MM2,The initial concept is still the best (in my book). Lots of fun and it brings back some great gaming memories.
4,It's back in stock!,"Now I can give up trying to duplicate it! Just the right amount of heat, and it is a flavorful heat, not just a sting. Thick and satisfying, and easy to keep at the office. For me, there was not an artificial taste, I wonder if the other reviewer had an expired product. As far as shelf stable soups go, I thought it tasted a lot fresher than shelf stable grocery store stews and meals that are available by the boxed mac n cheese. A bit pricey, so only 4 stars, but if you are tired of bland and boring, this might be for you."
1,Does not taste fresh,"As a native New Mexican transplanted to New York state, I'm always searching for something authentic from back home.This soup has all the right ingredients, but the flavor is overwhelmed by preservatives or chemicals of some kind; to me it tasted so bad that after the first package I had to throw the rest out.If you can get past the flavor, the packaging is very convenient for lunch at work, it heats up quickly in a microwave."
3,Merely OK,"Product is no better than most RTA furniture from big-box stores. Hinges are difficult to mount without a workbench and supports. Instructions have you doing things in strange order. Doors are NOT identical, there is a Right and a Left and the instructions do not indicate which. Latches are crap, I added a catch on the front to keep the doors closed."
4,Media Cabinet Rewiew,"Door hinges were difficult to mount. Used magazines to elevate the cabinet so that hinges would align properly. The sliding latch used to close the left hand door was difficult to align. Used masking tape to assist me in performing this task. Overall, I am pleased with the product. It's by far the best cabinet for storing DVD's and VHF tapes that I have come across."
1,Ignore this book if you are a serious programmer,"This books is totally useless for a serious C programmer used to an editor like vi and switching to emacs. It just doesn't cover enough ""progamming"" type features. You'll need a full length book."
5,good extra REFERENCE,"This is not a book to teach you how to use Emacs as some other reviewers think. This book is a reference and a reference only. It gives you a listing of common emacs commands. If you won't be going into the nitty gritty details of Emacs, use this. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and get Learning Emacs. This books is good at accomplishing its purpose...a secondary reference for Learning Emacs."
2,Almost useless,"I've tried to used this to look stuff up while learning Emacs, and it is not useful to me. I have two main objections: 1. It is not organized in a way that makes it easy to look things up. There have been times when I knew the information was in the book (since I had seen it before), but had to just flip through every page to actually find it. 2. It's very incomplete. I cannot find a command in this book that takes me to a given line in a file. I suspect the book fails because he tries to cover everything. I do not expect a pocket reference to cover some nonstandard HTML mode, or how to use Emacs as my mail reader. I want a reference on how to use it to edit text and code. I probably won't open this book again; I'll just bookmark the online manual."
1,Needs Serious Overhaul,"This book appears to be nice and indeed is, but it's too basic even for beginners. If you're a beginner, it won't do you any good because it's too simple yet to understand what it is about. If you're an advanced user, it's again too basic and lacks a lot of important references that should have been included (regexps, table commands, squeleton text commands, etc.). Take my advice: if you need a reference, buy the complete reference book from GNU Press which in return, has a pocket reference card attached to it (which BTW, you can also download for free...)"
2,Not too impressed,"Everyone tells me what a powerful editor emacs is. Maybe so, but this little book did very little to help me tap its power. It's unhelpful on how to change modes and on regular expression searches; I still have to use vi to make more complicated substitutions! Is that necessary? I guess not, but this book helped me not one bit.I give it 2 stars as it does have the saving grace of being short, and could get you started perhaps a little quicker than the online tutorial.Really! Someone ought to write a decent book on emacs."
2,"Down comforter with ""mature feathers""...?",(The 2 stars are for a product description that presents more questions than it provides information.) So is this a DOWN comforter or a feather comforter with some down? I suspect those mature feathers might have significant quills. A cover with only 230 thread count will not keep those quills from coming through! Ouch!!
3,Fill Power Is Only Half the Information Needed,"I have not yet bought this item. I am suspicious of any down item that includes information on its fill power (a measure of loft or volume per ounce), but no information about the fill weight (ounces of down)."
5,best in class hands down,"I have had this sander for 5 years and use it almost daily. I have sanded paint stain solid hardwood and softwood, metal rust and anything else a homeowner can imagine. It hasn't slowed down a bit in 5 years. With the abuse I give it I expected 3 yrs tops but it's still going. Probably the oldest and hardest used tool in my box."
3,A good sander but...,"...my sanding pad suddenly lost it's ability to hold the hook and loop discs. It had been used, but not enough for the hook/loop pad to fail so suddenly and completely. The cost of the replacement pad was almost 1/2 the cost of the sander!As others have noted, the dust collector is a joke.Until the pad (which is a nice, flat and firm design) failed, I was very happy with this tool. For home use, it's a fine tool. For steady professional use, keep shopping."
2,I would look into another sander,"It seems it would be easy to design a nice orbital sander. It's a fairly basic tool. But I've found the Porter Cable to have a couple really annoying flaws. First, the dust filter tends to spin with the pad and paper. As it turns it tends to catch on the cord and drag it into the sand paper. This mostly happens when sanding the edge of a board, but you end up having to hold the cord out of the way with one hand. Not cool... Secondly, the inside of the filter, before it is really full, becomes lined with dust, blocking the air flow. The filter then blows off, causing a mess and a dust cloud. You can plan on this happening about once every half an hour of sanding. Not cool either... Thirdly, (a matter of personal preference) I tend to like the shorter orbitals. They are easier to control, and less taxing on the wrists. Hope this helps."
4,fine product,"wore out my first one after 5 years- pad wouldn't hold velcro anymore and the bearings went south almost simulateously.Thought the product value and quality were good enough to replace with the same model.If you want dust collection hook it up to a 1000 cfm dust collector like i did. Now that works! Keeps the motor stone cold too.Heads up, I ordered the 333VSK with some improved features and indeed that's what the box said, but the model inside was the same old 333VS as indicated on the attached metal plate. Way to go Porter-Cable! Good attention to detail."
4,Good mineral sunscreen with high UVA/UVB Protection - EltaMD 45,"Finally a mineral-based sunscreen with high UVA/UVB protection that is far less thick and goey than the others I have tried. Only drawback for me is that I have dry skin, and this product is somewhat drying after it dries so I have to apply moisturizer on top. Other than that, good product at a decent price."
4,"Works, but not as expected","It smells and feels fantastic. It doesn't have that sunscreen smell, and feels and makes me feel silky smooth. It does work, even with my sensitive skin. It does not work like I expected. First, I am pale, really pale; so, pale I win most pale contests. Second, I like being pale. Third, when I have skin that is a normal skin tone, I look like a football. For the last two weeks, I was in New Mexico and Colorado doing a geological dig with my school for the DLM. I decided to try this product with the suggestion of my dermatologist. I reapplied every two hours and, while I did not get a sunburn, I did get a tan. I believe that I will continue with my old sunscreen which blocked the sun from my skin and did not even allow me to tan."
1,"Great show, but don't buy this","I love the dead zone. I find it to be very interesting and gripping. But I see no purpose for this DVD. This is the first episode, which is included in season 1, which is only 10 dollars more, so I cannot really think of a reason to own this dvd. 5 stars to the show, 1 for this dvd, just buy the season."
4,Very Impressed,Very impressed by this pilot episode. Looking forward to more episodes coming out on DVD.
2,this show is average,"I admit, I actually shed a tear when the Vietnamese doctor found his mother, but it was a cheap trick. Overall it was just okay, and even though able to evoke an emotion or two, which is why I believe the reviews are so kind, it doesn't stand up to the original (as a TV show it's not the greatest either). It is different than the original, in that half the plot is omitted and it's modern. Maybe in later episodes they fill in the rest of the story. I was mildly entertained, so it can't be all that bad, but these reviews led me to purchase- a mistake."
2,Be Careful,"This is the pilot show and is actually included in the 1st Season set. I wasn't sure so I ordered it. It is OK. It is nothing like the book OR movie, but is fair entertainment. I highly recommend the later seasons, but I guess you need to see Season One to understand the characters; especially Stilson. Don't order it if you have also ordered Season One."
1,"STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!","Oh I hate this crappy schlocky turkey. The original was a classic that was a great adaptation that did justice to the Stephen King novel (and I liked it alot better than the novel). No offense to Anthony Micheal hall, he is a good actor, but good actors don't save messes like this. Stick with the original David Cronenberg film and the novel. Avoid this bunk."
2,Not What I Expected,"A little disappointed, but then again this is the first time i used it. I ordered a couple of these and used with several partners...not much at all. They all requested i take it off."
4,Wicked,Daforce is all about skills i just finished buying your cd and its wild i really mean that my friend who just came back from san francisco told me she was surfing the web veryu impressive for a guy to freestyle on a whole album.
3,No Bad,Definetly different from anything I've heard so far. Weird but cool it grows on you i must admit you get your money's worth at least you'll remember this album.
2,Not sure,"the ep wasn't banging like i thought it would i must admit i wasnt 2 impressed with it, daforces skills is 55% the beats 1% sorry you get an F maybe your next one will be better. ?"
1,Super Rip-off,These guys pulled the same crap with their UFO Christmas DVD. Amazon should drop their products. R I P O F F ! ! !
5,Ogio 2007 Terminal Suitcase,Great travel bag. Lots of compartments. Several exterior handles make it easy to pick up from almost any angle. The casters are very smooth and quiet. It's look is very distinctive....easy to recognize on airport carousel.
3,an ok transportation review,"This is not a complete detail review text. You will still need your HCM, CERM, and Green Book. It is also the exact same text from the full Civil Engineering License Review book (the big book by Donald G. Newman). I returned this item since I already had the big book. It would be a good companion to have if you are not willing to purchase the big book and are planning on taking the Civil PE Exam. (transportation) It does clarify some terms that are not so clear in Lindbergs CERM. Also, the example problems are good, and the solutions are provided, (unlike the full Civil Engineering License Review where you have to purchase the different solutions manual.)"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"At the time my son was born, we were living with my parents and didn't have much room. I thought this would be an economical use of space and money. Yes, you can store quite a bit and it doesn't take up a lot of room; however, the wheels were always falling off, and after a few months it just fell apart. We eventually had to get something sturdier, so it was a big waste of money. If I can prevent one person from buying this piece of crap and wasting their money, I will feel better that at least someone was able to learn from my mistake."
2,Hard to put together,"I recieved this product as a baby shower gift, if I hadn't I would have returned it. It was hard to screw the metal rods together. It took me a couple of hours to just get the rods screwed together then put them and the woodenn dowels into the fabric. Then, when I tried to put the wooden rods on the outside I could not screw them to the rods and dowels in the fabric. I finally had to take it to my dad's house where he had to use his electric screwdriver. I gave this product two stars because of the fact that once it was all put together it is pretty sturdy. It is definitely not easy to put together like the box said which is why this product does not deserve a higher rating. Please do not buy this product with your own money, if you get it as a gift and decide to keep it make sure you have an electric screwdriver."
2,Not so practical once your baby turns toddler,"It's good to store baby items and have easy access. Since it doesn't have solid base so expect it to sag when you put too many things in it and it's quite wobbly too. The wooden rods that support 1st and 2nd shelf slide out after awhile. They should just sew it shut then it won't slide out. Now since my baby turns toddler I can't use it as before to store folded baby clothes, diapers, powder and lotion cause he'll pull everything out. Since it's wobbly he can topple the whole thing. So now I use it to store his toys and books which he'll still take out."
1,"If I could give this product a -5 rating, I would","The pieces in my set were mislabled such that putting the organizer together did not work according to instruction (it wasn't my error, either, lol. My engineer husband verified that the instructions and the labeled pieces did not match). Nothing was pre-drilled, and assembly was difficult even discounting the incorrect labeling. Once correctly assembled, the organizer was very unstable and 'rickety', for lack of a better word. Munchkin, Inc. refused to any remedy unless I completely disassembled the item and emailed them video proof of the mislabled product. Given my extraordinarily pregnant condition and knowing that it would take even more time crawling around on the floor to disassemble, I passed. I'll chuck the organizer and won't be giving Munchkin, Inc. any more of my business. Don't waste your money on this product."
3,average,this product is very flimsey but i dont want to down talk any thing it was going to be for my baby cloths but it went to my other son for his hot wheel cars
3,Too many pieces to assemble,"I believe the company could have made a mores sturdy design and there can be fewer pieces to assemble. It comes in a small package, which is good but that's a hassle to assemble. Moreover this is not so strong. But I guess, with the price tag, its worth it."
1,Don't Buy This. (Seriously.),"The baby care cart looks great in the photo. I figured for $20, we could have something to use and then toss for 6 months. Sadly, 72 hours after it was put together, it has fallen apart. It's a serious safety risk to be around a child, nevermind a baby!Poor qualityScrews don't line up with the woodWood will warp within daysDoes not hold any of the products it needs to, (too flimsy!)Buy another organizer, this isn't the one you want."
3,its okay,"Tool forever to put together, the metal pieces that were painted white flaked off, after assembling together it looked nice, and holds the necessary"
2,"shoddy construction, good idea","I just got this storage unit and I must say that putting it together was AWFUL. The screws don't fit/line up with the right holes and the directions are crazy. It took my husband and all his strength to get the screws in as far as they would go. I have a toddler running around, and I am concerned about him scratching himself on one. I placed it in the room so the side with the bulging screws is to the corner.That being said, it seems like a great idea. I have put all of my supplies for my coming baby in the cart. It's small enough to be out of the way, but large enough for tiny baby things. Once the baby gets bigger? Who knows what we'll do with it..."
3,its not that bad i like it ... good for pampers and wipes and socks,"for 20 dollars you cant beat it ... every helpful ..it took me 20 mins to put together ..not hard at all .....i would buy it again ,,,good for newborns"
3,good space saver,"I am happy with this storage cart. It serves it's purpose as a great place to store baby clothes and blankets or diapers. It is especially handy if space is limited. It fits nicely next to the crib in our bedroom where there's no room for another dresser. It is somewhat unsteady if too much weight is placed in it. I have it set up in a place where my baby will not be able to access it once she starts crawling, but I can see the potential of it falling over if a child tried to use it for support when standing."
2,Get the deluxe version!,"Munchkin makes two versions of this cart. This one and a deluxe version. I bought the deluxe first for my changing area and its been great. Only took me a few minutes to put together and has held up well. I needed a temporary place to store some of my older son's clothing so I went to buy another. I couldn't really tell the difference between the two versions at the store. From the picture it just looks like this one is missing the diaper holder. So I bought it to save $10. Boy am I sorry. This one is terrible to put together. It took me 45 minutes of frustration and power tools before I gave up and let my husband finish it. And I am pretty handy with these things. It's just okay now that it's assembled. It holds the clothes and when his room remodel is finished I'll probably toss it. Where the deluxe one will have future uses, just snaps together and it overall a MUCH better product."
2,Too flimsy,"This cart is nice because you can wheel it around the house and we placed it in our living room next to the portacrib, but it cannot hold much weight (the photo is misleading with all that stuff stacked nicely!). I would probably not get this item again if I went back in time.If you're looking for some guidance on what you should buy for your baby registry (vs. what you can live without), visit AllMomsArePerfect.com and look under ""preparing for baby."" It's got tons of down to earth advice for those that like to be prepared when baby comes but don't want to do all the research on every single baby product."
2,Expensive!,This item sells for $22 elsewhere. Why would you spend $58 when it isn't even that good according to the reviews here?
1,Do Not Buy!,This product should be taken off the market. The holes do not match up which means the screwdriver that the directions said you would need must be electrical so that you can drill your own damn holes! Needless to say the cart went back in the box and is still sitting there. It was the worst $22 I ever spent!
2,Effort not worth it,"I got this as a gift on baby shower. To be frank this might be my first product which looked so simpler but is one of the toughest to assemble together. I have assembled many furniture items so far but this one really tested my patience.I wonder what manufactures of this product had in mind when they made each of the piece so difficult to assemble. It could have been much simpler and I am sure it would have been a good product. Quality of the product material is fine for the money but just because of the poor assembly, it looses it's value."
2,Not good.,The cart itself is adorable but it is not sturdy in the slightest and is incredibly difficult to put together. Some of the wood pushes into itself and wont go in all the way without a little hammering which scuffs it up. I would not buy this ever again.
3,Sturdy for Light Stuff,"Before I bought this at Target (like 2 weeks ago) I read the review first, it received a lot of bad reviews and it was risky to buy. But I decided to buy it anyway. I just assembled it today, and I found out that it's not that hard at all. All you need to do is read the instructions very well and use an automatic screw driver (the one with battery) so it would be easier to assemble. I'm 34 weeks pregnant and it took me an hour or less maybe to finish it. Over all I like it for the price I got."
2,Not what I expected ...,To me it is not worth the money spent.. it does serve its purpose.. holds things... but it's crooked when I look at it from the side; wobbly
1,Junk/ Don't waste your $!,"My father-in-law which is very handy and had tools a driller put this together. It's NOT easy to assemble. It took him over an hour because he had to dismantle it and put it back together. We almost gave up and took it back. The instructions aren't clear and the holes on top didn't match screws. Also color parts and instructions were horrible. It's wobbly after all this work and assembled correctly. I didn't look at the reviews before I bought, which I should've. I just needed some extra storage along with my dresser. I'm using it with light things but it's fragile. Save your $ and buy something worth it."
3,Predicatable,"So I just finished this book, took me about a week. It had a good moral, but it was predictable. The language is corny like the author was attempting to fit into the shoes of a teenager in the present and they just don't fit.Otherwise okay. Easy to read."
4,All About Luck,"Carrie Fitzergald has been spoiled with luck all her life due to a lucky T-shirt her dad once gave her from a business trip. Now that T-shirt is gone, lost somewhere in India, after her mother accidentally gave it away as part of a charity donation. And Carrie's luck has gone with it: she's broken up with her boyfriend, had a fight with her bestfriend, and has gotten her first bad grade. So what will Carrie do? Travel to India to retreive her lucky T!This is a cool, perky novel for every girl to try! Read the book to find out what happens to Carrie in India!"
1,"Like Functions, but . . .","I bought the XE90fx when it first came on the market (through Amazon because it was not available in retail stores yet). It was the only machine that did everything I wanted for a reasonable price. I am now on my fourth machine. No, I have not bought more machines, rather Xerox has replaced the first three. On the first machine, the clip on the paper tray broke (it is rather flimsy). Xerox replaced that machine with a refurbished machine which did not feed straight. The third machine (also a refurbished machine) did not feed at all - right out of the box. Since we'd had so many problems they sent us another new machine. This one has developed spotting in the printing. None of them have been able to print on my letterhead (the ink smudges). I love the variety of functions, and wish it actually performed. Unfortunately, it is not nearly sturdy enough. Xerox has been good about replacing the machines, but after awhile enough is enough."
2,Plagued With Issues,I don't have enough time to list all the problems that I've had with this unit. I wouldn't have another one even it it was free.
4,Great but Beware!,"This machine is everything I want in a single machine and easily fits in my home office. Great quality! However, this machine will not scan if you have an AMD processor found in high-end Compaqs such as mine. So beware of that since the company does not mention that in any literature."
5,Solid and heavy duty,I love this wall mounted hose hanger. Forget about the plastic roll up type hangers. They do not hold up. This product should last for ever. It just holds a 100 foot length of hose. Would buy again if ever needed. Highly recommend to others looking for a no frills but highly functional and sturdy product.
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the best birthday presents I got. I got the courage mogu and I love it hope to get more of them! if you don't have one then you are missing out!
4,Mogu man,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my younger sister because she already has the Mogu Joy and wanted him to have a friend. She loves her new Mogu man. The only con is that the Mogu People products stain rather easily and can only be spot cleaned.
4,Satisfied Customer,"I received the product very quickly. I'm impressed with the customer service that Orange Onion provided. I had a question about the product that I'd received, and received a response from the company within hours. My experience leads me to believe that this company stands behind the products that it sells."
4,Just buy it,"Sorry, but this one will be short. I see other people have gone in depth about this game.here are the facts: It is fun. it is a bitch sometimes, and it is NOT a shooter. It plays like any first person adventure, but you have to sneak around a lot (like Planet of the Apes) and learn to fire a bow over long distances - which they did excellently on graphics-wise.If you are reading this you probably are wondering ""if"" you should buy it. Yes. Trust me."
5,Atmosphere,"Thief 2 seems a little less convoluted than the first game. There were some really long and arduous levels in the that one!The same stealth and tension remains in 2 and the graphics are O.K. but in all seriousness not that much different from the first.The different levels are varied and beautifully scripted. One time you may be required to steal certain items from a Lord the next, simply follow a guard through the streets without being detected. The whole atmosphere is one of tension and fear. You may enter into a room where guests chat and pass comments about characters you are after. Thief 2 is an example of how computer games are pushing the standards of gaming and story lines. It's not for Serious Sam fans, but it is for lovers of beautiful game design and carefully crafted atmosphere."
5,An Improvement over Thief Gold,"This is the best game I've played. I do prefer it to the original Thief because they seem to have gotten rid of the zombies.If I had to say something bad about this game it would be that it is so dark. Of course darkness is consistent with being a thief, but I have to play it at night with the room lights practically off.Since I just got a new PC (733 coppermine/128MB rdram/geforce 256 64mb ddr) it runs like a dream, and I play at max resolution."
4,the real world?,"this game sux for one reason, i started playing the demo around 12:30 or 1:00, next thing i know it's almost 5:00! thanx to the makers of this game for adding one more addiction to my life"
1,This looks more like the Dark Age.,"I tried playing this game, but right from the start, I knew I was in trouble. No matter what I changed in the video options or on my monitor, this game was just too dark. The first guy I talked to I couldn't even see and the item he left me I couldn't find because it was just too dark. This is the only game I have had this problem with. It could be an awesome game, but I will never know."
1,"Crash, black and boring","I spent hours on the phone trying to get the game to work and this is running an Athlon 750 processor with a GeForce DDR 256 graphics card and 512mb ram. It kept crashing my machine, when it didn't it was too dark to see. The plot was bad and there was poor logic to tasks. It just dragged on, Thief was much better and didn't try to be too clever. Don't buy this!"
2,"Dark, Dark, Dark","I love gaming, and really wanted to play this game, but it was just too doggone DARK! Most of the time, the screen is completely black. I think they saved a lot on graphics development. ;o)I played for 45 minutes, and couldn't even get inside the building! I kept getting stuck on some unseen barrier, and the map they give you shows your general location, but was not detailed enough to pinpoint where I was and show me how to get around whatever I was stuck on.My husband played for one afternoon, and didn't see much of anything either. The screen was black about 80% of the time.I'd like to be able to see at least an outline of what's in front of me. Maybe the next game will be ""Thief III: The Cave."" :o)"
5,SHEER PERFECTION IN SCENT,"THEE, best, sexiest men's cologne ever created on the planet...pure genius.I've been wearing this as my signature scent for nearly 20 yrs. and it never gets old. After a shower just ""walk into"" one good spray of this accross the chest and neck (Do Not over due the spray, just one good one two MAX) will last the whole day and night...UNTOLD amounts of compliments from women. Creates an unbeleivable attraction by others. I've paid as high as $65 for this...this price is a steal, get two! Amazing scent. For a man, its perfection."
1,Don't get overcharged.. notice its the 1oz size not the 3.4 oz on other sites,This product is way over priced you are paying for 1oz size what other sites charge for the 3.4 oz size... very disapointed will send back ASAP
3,Decent,"I got this looking for some quality occult fiction the king I found in Aleister Crowley and to a lesser extent Silver Ravenwolf. I thought it was a good book with a cool dak side cover artwork, but I found the plot of a group of psuedo heroes avenging a rapist to be buried beneath a premise of genuine occult things. I guess it is worth the kind of low price you'd expect from a mass market paperback format. I thought it had some suspense especially with the satanists involved. Occult fiction is one of those unique sub genres- you'll either love it or hate it."
2,Confusing the LDS faith with the Fundamentalists,I appreciate the fact that the story of the abuse within the fundamentalist church is trying to be told here. I am very familiar with this organization as I lived in a neighboring community. Much of what was portrayed in this film was true. However it is confusing the LDS or Mormon Faith with the fundamentalists they are not the same. In doing so there are way too many lies being portrayed. I wish that more attention was paid to accurate truths.
5,empty cradle,its about this lady that is a nurse and she wants babies so she kiddnaps one from hospital it wasnt good enough she kills for the second one
3,That's a nice rib!,"This stuffed frog was purchased to add yet another ""rib"" to my 2-year-old's stuffed frog collection. He liked this one a lot because he just learned about poison dart frogs from one of his books, and all of his others frogs are green and brown. My only complaint is that the uniform size of the black spots is an inaccurate depiction of the true frog's skin pattern."
5,Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
5,The first and perhaps the strongest of the Star Wars score,"From the opening Fox Fanfare to the first notes of John Williams score, Star Wars: A New Hope is the one of the greatest scores of all time. While I prefer the maturity of Return of the Jedi, A New Hope is just as good, because it is the score that began it all. It is the classic score from the trilogy. While there are not as many of the themes so well known to Star Wars, the classics are there. Luke's theme, the Force theme, Leia's theme and the old school style of the orchestra. Themes like the Imperial march are hinted at, but not fully realized. Overall, however, this is a great score, one of the greatest of all time."
5,Wonderful!,"A classic soundtrack, this copy having great sound quality (as opposed to the old tinny sound that often comes with non-remastered older works)."
2,Disappointed in KY,"I was very disappointed in this CD. Not the original versions ... all remixed. Even though Tommy James still has a great voice, the music sounded ""tinny"" and I found myself listening to the background music and wondering why they messed with the classic sounds of the oldies."
1,Don't buy it,I'd give less than 1 star if I could. Please take the time to listen to the available tracks and you will not need an explanation as to why I'm asking you not to buy it. Purchase the one from Rhino instead.
4,Clear and Concise,"I bought this book for a class on Neurological disorders to go hand in hand with another book whose language supposedly ins't in layman's term. This book is very clear and concise regarding all the functions of the brain, its pathway, the baby brain through adulthood, and all of the neurological disorders."
4,Excellent for teachers,This book enplane in a simple but effective way the brain and how important it is for the process of learning.
2,"Decent, but still not great","I bought this book for an education class. It's a decent book, but having previously received a degree in Psychology, this book doesn't nearly cover the material as in depth as it should. It barely covers the basics and if you aren't familiar with this information in the first place, you wouldn't have a clue what its talking about!"
4,Sophisticated scent for a classic or modern woman.,"This is a classic scent, not flowery at all. Sophisticated powdery and musky aroma. Designed for nighttime wear although I have worn it during the day a few times and loved it. Very subtle when applied, but long lasting."
2,Way too strong,"This perfume smells like old lady, it's way too strong and old fashioned. I bought it because I saw it in a movie, I had to give it away. Didn't like it."
1,"Heavy, heavy scent",I have read so much about Joy by Jean Patou that I finally broke down and ordered a bottle. The scent is very heavy and cloying. I will not wear it.
3,"It's a good book to get, if ya don't have have the original","When I first read the there was going to be a character animation book for Lightwave 6 I was pretty exited. So, I ordered it as soon as it was available. When I recived it I was not to happy to find out that well over 60% of the book is just a reprinting of Kelly's previous 'Character Animation' book, which I already own. Don't get me wrong, It's a very solid book, but having to spend Fifty bucks for a few new chapters is pretty weak. If I knew that earlier, I would not have bought the book. But like I said, the book is good, mainly because it goes into alot character development, and preproduction, which is over looked by most other books. and preproduction."
1,Badly Named,"The first 5 chapters of this book cover story writing and storyboarding. The premise behind this is that you can't design a character without having a story. The next few chapters dealt primarily with how you would use very expensive digitizing equipment (think laser telemetry), and how to touch up data artifacts. The last few chapters deal with outputting your project. I saw nothing on modeling and animation using Lightwave as the primary tool. I'll give away the big secret of the book right here: Build a clay model and photograph it."
2,Not very helpful,"I was excited when I saw this book, being fairly new to LW6 (although experience in other apps). I saw it as a chance to get good with the character animation toolset. However, the book is mostly general character animation theory, and has little to with Lightwave at all. Sure, it has valid info on designing and storyboarding characters in 3D, but I already know that -- I wanted detailed information on how to apply what I know to Lightwave 6. I'd advise on skipping this one. There's better info out on the web, for free."
2,Particle board comes apart,"I made the mistake of ordering 3 of these before trying it out first. Like a lot of un-assembled furniture, this lateral file comes with the usual assorted hardware of Ikea-style turn fasteners. It looks ok but the problem is the cheap particle board... turn a screw just a little too much and you're toast- the wood breaks right off leaving you with no way of getting the unit properly assembled.Besides that, I tilted one while trying to move it (while empty) and the cheap plastic foot broke right off. I had to use a piece of plywood as a patch to fix it. There's no doubt this will not hold up to repeated use and am not putting anything heavy or of value on top of it. Plainly put it's not good furniture, if you manage to get it assembled it will likely only weather a couple years of use. There's cheaper furniture out there, but not by much. I spent an entire day putting together the three cabinets and learned my lesson. I will never waste my time with such cheap crap again."
4,excellent book - sets the standard for folk history,Reviewer: A reader from Dublin & LondiniumAn excellent book giving good historical contextual information and old folk tales from asampling of the Celtic nations. It sets the standard for this type of book combining rarehistorical insight to the oral tradition.It is suitable book/gift for any 7-16 year old.Naoise O'H
3,Examine before you put it together,Item would look great on wall holding wine bottles - once put together. Not sure how weight of full bottles of wine will hold up since the wine holders were attached only with small screws and bolts. Purple marbles were depicting the grapes - however two grapes had fallen off and were not in the box. I bought as a housewarming gift and was quite embarrassed that it was damaged. Recipient loved the concept and said she would rather replace the marbles herself than go to the trouble of me returning it. I wonder what happened to quality control?
5,Great rack ... :),This wine rack holds four average sized bottles of wine and has a great design to it. My parents loved it as a Christmas gift.
2,Buy it used,An artfully packaged stereotype of simplistic harmonies and recycled lyrics sung by a young singer drawing upon a limited life experience for creative juice. It would be good as background elevator music but I wouldn't recommend spending money to buy it new. A huge disappointment.
3,Promising and different,Pros:Good organization of the materialChapters are structured in a way that helps learningImages are unique in their approach to demonstrating the anatomyCons:I've heard from several unrelated sources that the book has lots of inaccuracies in it (I've yet to find one)Many of the diagrams are oblique views that take some time to figure out the orientation and then relate it to anatomical position
3,"Good companion to anatomy, but not stellar.",Dense book with excellent illustrations and good text. Helpful but lacking solid overviews at the beginning of chapters and connections between systems. Also not very helpful index. I would look elsewhere for another text to accompany this one or perhaps a better all-around text.
3,Excellent book,A requirement textbook for my college course.It is an excellent book with a lot graphs and clear illustrations.
2,eh ok...,"This was one of my worst experience dealing with someone off of Amazon.com, the book took almost a month to get here, thank god i didnt need it for class. When I ordered the book it said it was in very good condition. When it arrived, the cover was all bent and ripped, and some of the pages were the same way. Would return it, but i dont have another month to wait to get another book. I guess this is what you get for looking for the cheapest way to get things done. The sad part is that when the package arrived, it said it came from chicago, I live exactly 23 minutes from Chicago, so I dont understand why something that was at most and hour away would take a whole month to get to my doorstep."
3,Not a Waste of Time,This a good book for those who are expecting to get rich merely because they already have a strategy. This book provides a lot of examples to describe the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies.
2,"A poor Eddings, and I don't even like Eddings that much.","I liked A Single Spell, so I gave this a go.It was a mistake. The story is the same as a lot of fantasies out there. A special boy coming to terms with his power. But unlike Eddings, who has used this plot over and over, this books characters are not entertaining at all. The writing is mediocre, and the plot is subpar. I mean, an army of zombies? Just doesn't do it for me.Don't buy this book. Buy Tigana or Song for Arbonne for a REAL fantasy."
3,Good book. Never reaches great heights.,"I expected something on par with The Misenchanted Sword or The Lure of the Basilisk. Not so. This book is a mixed bag for me. I found the writing clean and enjoyable if somewhat lacking depth. The book is very large yet very little seems to be necessary and much that seems necessary is lacking. Over all a good read but a some what bizarre, melancholy and anticlimactic ending."
2,Very Generic,"Some of Watt-Evans books are pretty good, so when I saw this one I picked it up. Big mistake. Did he consciously try to write the most generic story possible? Village blacksmith, disliked by his peers, is ""touched by the gods"" with supernatural powers, and is fated to go forth and save everyone from an evil power, blah, blah, blah. People, just because you like sci-fi/fantasy doesn't mean every such book is great. The other reviewer was right - go pick up a book by Guy Gavriel Kay (""A Song for . . .""), George R.R. Martin, or even Steven Brust."
1,HOw sad is this,Amazon wants you to pay money for this but can't ever get you a track listing so you know what your buying!
3,"Good effort, despite flaws","It's hard to give this work a negative review, because it's a decent effort. However despite it's size, it's too short :) The info seems to reflect the editor's Eurocentric point of view: there is decent coverage of World Cup and Euro events. Latin American coverage is very weak, and Asian/African virtually non-existant. Also, it seems a bit too heavy on the very recent past. While this is understandable, it also can be annoying at times. For example, under ""Great Players"", most current decent players are covered, but many older ones omitted. And there are some glaring screwups: Jordi Cruyff, who hasn't done much, gets a writeup, but Berti Vogts, one of Germany's best ever defenders, capped 96 times, World Champ, etc. is only mentioned as a coach. I'm sure you could find plenty of other glaring faults. But rather than harp on all the problems, I will say that it's a useful addition to a soccer fan's library. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses."
3,Oldie (now) but still a goodie,"What can I say about this? Initially the tracks themselves didn't mix well to my liking, but after listening for a little while (and putting the player on randmoize) I've grown to like this album more.Its light, its non-thinking, and its an easy one to put on in the background and continue conversations.All in all, not bad, not brilliant."
3,Decent Schumann,"I can second everything that the Gramophone reviewer says. Zukerman and Neikrug have more success with the first sonata than the second. Brahms spent a lot of time helping the Schumanns during Robert's last years, and became immersed in their music. You can hear echoes of the first movement of the second sonata in the finale of Brahms Fourth symphony. And just as a Brahms symphony can be played lean and driving, versus solid and majestic, so can the first movement of Schumann's Second Violin Sonata. Zukerman and Neikrug opt for the more ponderous interpretation, diverging from Kremer/Argerich (DG) and Kaler/Slutsky (Naxos) whom I heartily recommend. The shorter pieces for violin and for viola are beautifully done, and it was good of RCA to provide an extra disc for them. The recorded sound is excellent."
1,Totally Unreadable.,"I am not a debunker. Quite the Contrary, I am a Tarot Reader, and have been quite convinced in the presence of the visitors since reading Richard Dolans excellent UFO's and the National Security state. So I am pretty well open to the potential Ideas in material like this book. However, I was barely able to force myself through the first 100 pages of this work, in the fading hope it would get better.The only thing the author seemed to be Channeling to my mind, was the Plutonic Ideal of pure BS. Perhaps however I am wrong, it is difficult to imagine a person who actually speaks the english language writing such awkard prose. So she might have been channeling a Pledian after all."
3,its Okay,"again I like this author but she continues with the meditations that I find annoying, if you can continue to read the book there is much to learn from it. still I hope any future writings from this author will eliminate this trend"
5,A Great Overall Intro to Mental Magic,"Marvin Kaye's ""The Handbook of Mental Magic"" is one of the best books to begin for those who wish to learn about mental magic. Not only does he cover the basics of most mental magic, he also gives new and interesting twists to some standard effects. Check out his effect ""In Stygian Depths"" to see how effects can be dressed up. In addition to many great effects, one of the best things about this book is its bibliography. I have used that bibliography to expand my library of magic and related mental areas. I can't recommend this book to highly for those interested in a basic foundation for mental magic and a great bibliography to expand on this interesting field of magic. The only weakness this book has, if any, is that it is dated and does not have some of the newer material in the bibliography"
2,"Please, don't waste your time","I am a freshman student at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul MN, and am actually shocked that I had to read this book in my freshman English course. My professors obviously wanted a light read to finish the year off, and this Oprah ""book of the month"" is just that: light. Everything in this book is on the surface, there are no insights that are left to the reader to discover and work out. I will agree that there is a good premise behind this story, but it never gets off its feet. I found myself laughing at the fake drama that Wenner creates throughout this novel. I found this novel highly unrealistic, not because of the story but because of its form. My worst critique deals with Annie. She is self-involved, obnoxious, inconsistent, and one of my least favorite literary characters...period.Please save yourself the dread of this book, and pick up a Faulkner or Steinbeck instead.Jeffrey"
4,Delivers the Goods,"Once you get past the (very necessary) finite field stuff you're hip deep in everything you ever wanted to know about codes - block codes, convolutional codes, binary, ternary, you name it.I found the discussion of Reed-Solomon codes particularly good. So *that's* how they work!Some new stuff missing (Turbo Codes), but that's always going to happen."
5,A Great Book for NYS High School Students,"If your worried about the biology regents, or even if your not this book is a great and comprehensive reveiw of biology for the Regents exams. It included many practice tests that allow you to check your answers. It also includes many practice questions to help students fully prepare for the regents exam."
2,Misrepresented,"I ordered this book because when I looked at the first few pages of the book on amazon before ordering, I saw that this book had regents from 2002 & 2003, exactly what i was looking for. When I received the book, it did not have 2002/2003 regents as shown. It had later regents than what my nephew's teacher asked him to get. So this book can not be used in class. Needed the book with 2002/2003 regents."
4,Barron's Regents Exams and Answers: Biology,"This book was very informative and helpful. It includes practice questions to help one to better understand the Regents exam, especially first time Regents exam takers."
3,Meh,"I have bought nearly all of the Superstars performance dvds. The last two have been okay at best. In my opinion some of their best stars are no longer with them (Ansuya, Rachel Brice, Sharon Kihara).Zoe Jakes performance on the dvd was my favorite one. Sonia also had some great peformances, but overall I was really underwhelmed. 3D is overrated."
4,Fun for a toddler,"My 21 month old loves Elmo so when we found this while looking for Christmas gifts, we decided to go for it. He loves the truck and how the back pops open. I have to wonder how sturdy the pop up pole and net are going to be, but 1 1/2 months later it's still going strong."
5,My 2yr old grandson loves this toy:),I bought this for my grandson who is 2 and he is a big Elmo fan - He plays with it a lot:) Seems to be pretty durable.
4,Quality pop,"Ronan Keating's debute doesn't re-innovate pop music, but it still is a very enjoyable and stylish sample of it. 'Ronan' is much better and consists far more grown-up music than the average Boyzone-album. Of course most of these songs are love songs, but they are not as stroppy and the texts have more contents than you could expect from the singer of a boyband. The major charm of this album is that Keating doesn't copy Boyzone-songs or other styles, or that he doesn't use all the cliché's and the tricks possible to make a pop song. He tries to find his own, adult style, in which he succeeds quite well by combining nice pop music with traditional Irish elements. At that, this album contains two really outstanding songs, ""Life is a Rollercoaster"", a quite original song at that, plus ""When You Say Nothing at All"", a beautiful ballad. Also ""Heal Me"" is very nice. Ronan Keating has also a really nice voice and hey, without wanting to sound pathetic: he's got the looks! :-)"
5,This Guy is Great!,"Terrific CD. His complilation of best songs over the last 10 years is even better, but this one is a winner, too."
4,Commendable effort from an artist,"Shedding the boy-band image, Keating has showed the industry his real ability to sing, perform and write as an artist. His music has mature through the years, branching from the boy-band tunes to Bryan-adams-vs-rick-price adult contemporary. Though not a wide repertoir of music can be found in this album, tunes written by Rick Nowels (produced Belinda Carlise), Patrick Leonard (produced Madonna's earlier albums) and Bryan Adams will definitley call for replays on air and not forgetting the karaoke stations."
3,not bad.. but,"Ronan Keating strikes out on his own and he does well for a first timer solo artist but his debut falls short. There are too many ballads, and most of the songs are very standard mid-tempo fluff. That would be fine if the lyrics were better. It begins with the loveable ""life is roller coaster"" but after that peak it just slowly falls flat. Other higlights are: ""if i don't tell you now"", and ""only for you."""
3,Debateable,"I just got this album the other day and I must say, I was a lil' disappointed with it. I had heard ""When You Say Nothing At All"" ""Life is a Roller Coaster"", and ""If I don't Tell you Now"" and I was expecting the songs to sound more like those. I'm also a huge Boyzone fan. This album includes the 3 songs I mention above, but the other tracks aren't too much to boast about. They're good for backgroud music, but in terms of really getting into it, I found it a tad bit hard."
3,Keating not up to the hype of fans.,"Keating may possess one of the best voices in the industry, his own record label and countless fans whether alone or with his boyband. However this solo offering is just : Unimpressive GENERALLY. It does contain a few good singles such as the 1st cut and tracks 12 & 13, but the overall tone despite his above average vocals is just plain. Stick to the limited edition singles if you're thinking of buying this album."
5,A Brilliant Book for a wonderful writer,"THis is a brilliant book. Dr. Daniel Dorman has done something few doctors have the patience to do or care. He cured someone over 7 years with severe schizophenia without any drugs - just a belief in himself and her recovery.The last chapter is worth the price of the book. He is a compassionate, caring doctor who believes minds are not broken.That people can be cured without drugs, by going deep within themselves they can change - drastically.He is a real healer."
2,Not mathematical strict enough,"I used this book in an applied math for physicists course. The book is generally easy to read and starts with a short summary of vector calculus, complex analysis and linear algebra. However I'd say that this is only usable for brushing up, and shouldn't be used to learn the stuff from scratch. The rest of the book is not too challenging and contains many examples.My main problem with this book, however, is that it is not strict enough when it comes to the math. She often assumes that a variable or a function is real, without stating it and not considering the general case of a complex function. I'm really glad I had another book on real analysis to get the mathematical foundation to really understand the subjects."
2,Use your common sense and save $10,"As a future first-time mom with no motherly instinct, I thought this book would be a great help to help me figure out activities to do with baby. Unfortunately, this book has not allowed me to reach my goal. All the ""baby"" activities are more than common sense. It's also a bit frustrating to see no age recommended for the baby activities. Babies grow quite a bit until they get into toddlerhood and so which one fits which stage? You won't know. All in all, I didn't find this book useful but I analyzed it from a ""baby"" point of view only. It may be more useful for older kids but I don't think I'll get to read it. Not a keeper."
4,you like bread?,"if you like bread and don't cut it 24h hours a day, buy this knive instead of the 4 star version.why?- the twin select are nice sharp knives- it is a bread knive, you don't use it so often like a chef knive!- the handling is fine- it's cheapI own 2 twin selects and 4 4 stars. And must say the handling of fourstar is better and you want to have the filet knive or chefs knive from this series, or better some japanese knieve ( way sharper, but hard to maintain, I'm lazy), but for cutting bread, go with this one, the handling is not so important for cutting bread, and it does'nt squeeze my ciabatta or french bread!"
4,My Son says its the best knife ever!,I sent this knife to my son who is a baker by profession--he loves this knife. It doesn't mash the bread and cuts through crusty crusts! I higly recommend it to anyone.
5,Great value for German made bread knife,"I would recommend the ""Twin"" series knives as they are forged and made in Germany. These are an outstanding value even when buying individual knives."
5,Great Bread Knife!,"I can say that I'm very happy with this bread knife. I'm really not qualified to review it as a professional might, but I can give you my simple opinion and observations as someone who uses a bread knife a couple of times a week:* Nice and sharp - cuts bread very well without ""squashing"" it* Comfortable handle* Dishwasher safe* Very nice quality for the priceI'm considering to buy one more so I always have one clean."
2,flexible plastic sheet with velcro seem,"the title explains what this thing really is. But then again if celestron or amazon described it as such you wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it.i was expecting a tube made of tough and sturdy material. this will probably do the job, so i'm not gonna go through the hassle of sending it back.maybe it was made for easier transportation, but i would have rather received a single solid tube that was made specifically for the 11"" ,just not impressed by the design and the material, specially not for 40 bucks."
3,refreshing,"This band keeps me guessing! Each time I think they have a defined sound, the cd changes. From stark pop to chaotic layers of electronics. They've even managed to successful re-work stephin merrit's ascerbic tune of solitude into a meeting of two lonely hearts. You won't be sorry."
5,One word - Whoa!,"I can't believe Cookie Galore hasn't been picked up by a major label yet. This is by far the most interesting release I've heard in the past year (and I've heard a lot). It's a really good mix of electronic and acoustic instruments. Typically, this type of music is totally devoid of melody, but no so with this CD. I found myself humming along with Evil, Suffer and God after the first listen. Don't waste your money on the overwraught, overblown Nine Inch Nails double CD. Get this instead. All the flavor and none of the fat."
3,ground breaking,"This cd is difficult to classify because I think that the music is really different from anything else that is out there. For example, the first track (Paris) combines electrical and acoustical sounds in an innovative way that I don't think any other band has even thought about. The second track (I'm the One) reminds me of bands like Portishead, recent Moby, Massive Attack, and even Frente - but there's still something unique about the song that I can't quite put my finger on. The later tracks are more techno/industrial with a poppy twist.I'm curious to see how Cookie Galore's music will evolve in the future. It takes most bands 2 or 3 albums before they find a sound that is unique to them - I think Cookie Galore has already achieved that. Portable One is definitely an album on the cutting edge, and a welcome relief from the mainstream 'alternative' bands on the radio."
3,The Mystery of Olga Chekhova,"The book is nicely written and her ancestry and relationship to the great Anton Chekov and his family is interesting but in the end the mystery of Olga remains a mystery and the book goes nowhere. Was she a spy in Germany during WWII for the Soviets? Maybe but it seems they made little use of her if she was. I found that unlike his history of WWII which is excellent, this book was not too meaty and quite disappointing."
2,"The ""mystery"" remains a mystery","Unfortunately the assumed promise of this book, to determine if Russian-German actress Olga Chekhova was indeed a Russian spy during the 1930s and 40s, is never adequately discussed or even mentioned beyond a number of tantalizing hints. Instead what we have here is a family history of Chekhova's years in Russia during the Revolution through the 20s and Nazi years in Germany. It all seems rather skimpy and vague. Even for those wanting further information on Chekhova's career as a stage and film actress will find very little here, only a few names and film titles -- the same for any of her so-called ""relationships"" with Hitler and other top Nazis. A disappointment and not recommended."
4,This is a treat of a read,"Wife for a Year by Rachel Lindsay~ Harlequin Presents #413 ~ February 1981This is a treat of a read! I had forgotten how captivating the Presents from the 80's were. In this lovestory, our heroine Juliet has developed an incurable illness that causes her legs to weaken and no longer able to support her. This brings her to our hero, Damon, the neurosurgeon who diagnoses her. Refreshing is that we, the reader, are privy to Damon's thoughts and see that he has fallen in love with Juliet from first sight. He concocts a marriage of convenience in the hopes that during the contracted year, Juliet will have fallen in love with him too. I'm going to seek out some more ""oldies"" from my TBR"
1,This is how Amazon Bait and switches you,"I really wanted these shorts and ordered an XL which was an option, and my size. I also ordered the matching shirt, which I really didn't want, but it was on sale and the shipping was combined so I thought it was worth it. Well it turns out that they didn't have the shorts, but only had the shirt.So I wound up paying and receiving the item I really didn't want, and not getting the item I really want. Amazon would have charged me to reship the item back which didn't make sense.If I could rate this lower that a one I would!"
4,Superb,"Very sublime. The pacing is nearly ideal; not too slow or fast. Richard Stoltzman is one of the true Masters of this instrument, and RCA did a fine remastering of the recording. Minimal tape hiss, & great dynamic range."
5,lipiderm caps,"I love this for all my dogs. This particular brand in capsule form has NEVER given my pets any GI upset. I have tried other oils in and not in capsule form that have caused diarrhea to my dogs in the past 15 years. Lipiderm caps I am very pleased with as far as agreeing with the dogs' stomachs. I give it daily in addition to a super premium holistic diet and it makes the dogs coats super shiny. One of my dogs developed a dermatitis to her back when she was young and with increased doses of the lipiderm caps because of the omega it has in it, helped heal her skin even sooner. This is a very good product and I highly recommend it. Even if you feed your dogs organic and holistic foods such as myself, this supplement is the way to go!"
4,Symphonic/Neo Prog greats,"This is probably the best work from these neo proggers. I love the intricate guitar/bass/keys/drums on this cd. Paintbox shows what a great keyboardist Nolan is and shows that he must have been an understudy of Banks at the Tony Banks School For Keyboard. These guys are not quite the caliber of Arena or Pallas being that they're a little less aggressive. But, they are still worth a listen."
2,Mediocrity abounds.,"This is what prog evolved into? This outfit offers little in the way of originality and inovation. The musicianship is competent but no where near the level of the best of 70's progressive musicians. The vocalist is like many of the vocalists who live in the higher registers, overemoting with nothing truly expressive to present. Lyrics are embarassingly immature, melodies and arrangements cliche. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about with this outfit. Save your money, give Pendragon a pass...Simon"
5,worth the money,Straight forward install. Great value. No complaints so far. Went on my 97 tahoe that had a sagging rear. I can now adjust the rear as a whole or manipulate just 1 side based on cargo load. You must get it with the in-car air control/compressor. Makes life easier.
5,Great thermos,This make of vacume bottle keeps hot liquid warm for eight hours. At the end of the day coffee is still decently warm.
2,Conditioning spray,Product smelled really nice. Only lasted for an hour or so. Did not make a huge difference in my dogs coat. Would not purchase again. Seller was great! Received item in time alloted. Packaged well.
2,I don't recommend it.,"I bought this player for myself as a Christmas present. I dropped it once and the battery door broke. No problem, I was able to keep it closed with tape...not the nicest looking thing, but it also wouldn't have been covered to be fixed so, it worked for me. Then I reach into my bag the other day and find that the play button had been pressed into the the player and would not come out. I had the ""Hold"" button on so I don't know how it could have happened. When I contacted Sony about getting it repaired they said it would cost $77 for them to look at and possibly send me a new one. If they deemed it was from abuse, it would cost more. $77? That's more than half of what I paid for it. Not. Worth. It. Especially when prices have dropped and you can get some players with more memory for about $99. I would check out the other players for before deciding on this one."
2,Secular selection and performance,"This recording does not compare to ""Sacred Treasures"" or ""Orthodox Shrines of the Russian North - Tikhvin Monastery"" which are excellent examples of sacred Russian Orthodox singing. I sing in a Russian Orthodox Choir and feel that ""Ancient Echoes"" provides a poor window to Orthodox Spirituality, both in view of the selection and the performance. Such a presentation as recorded on this CD would not be found in any Orthodox monastry."
4,All Things Russian,"As a lover of Russian history and Russian literature, I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon of reading while listening to Ancient Echoes. Although it was not what I expected, it enhanced my love of all things Russian, especially its liturgical sound -- something I've never heard before!"
5,A supurb celebration of the MALE voice and choral unity,"This album is simply an incredible display of the full range of the Male voice, in singular tone and group unity. The sweetness of the tenors, blending with the deep basses in harmonic unity is a tonal experience you have to hear to fully appreciate. These choral selections will easily let you get lost in the emotional blending of the voices, stirring your emotions, or will wrap around your mood as you get lost in your own thoughts. NO matter that you don't understand the words. Like Opera, the vocal tones and blending harmonies will grab you over and over. The last 40 seconds of selection #2, or last minute 10 secs of #6 are well worth the price of this CD, but in truth every song is awesome. A must for every fan of male choral or deep voices."
3,Here's proof E. B. White had to work for a living.,"""Writings from the New Yorker"" is a poorly organized commercial re-packaging of E. B. White snippets banged-out under the pressures of deadlines in the work-a-day world. In spite of my respect for the man and my love of his more carefully crafted writings, this book sputtered and stalled as I read along.But E. B. White does manage to shine through this collection in spite of its hodge-podginess and your reward for plowing through it will be the discovery of a gem here and there.Were he still with us, White himself would likely have a field day editing this book, tossing out stuff. For one thing, his editors made him use ""we"" instead of ""I"" in these unsigned pieces which he objected to and which makes you wonder just how ""handcuffed"" he was in other unspoken ways as he wrote them.If you're an E. B. White groupie who simply must read everything White has ever written, buy this book. Otherwise--save your money."
5,read it again--and again,"I say, and not for the first time or after reading his first book (I've read them all, again and again) that anyone who wants to learn to write contemporary English as it should be written should close himself in a room with EB White for as long as it takes. He or she might even learn to be a better person from the example."
2,If this is the Great & Powerful E.B. White I think I'll pass.,If this is the Great & Powerful E.B. White I think I'll pass.It's a collection of vignettes about everything and nothing. Ladles of words dipped from his stream of consciousness.I was bored.
4,"Left blade is better, but it's not for everyone","Don't get me wrong, the saw is fabulous, but like one of the other gentlemen said, ""It takes some getting used to"". With the left blade position, you do tend to have your saw support fall away after the cut, and I've noticed much more debris being thrown up into my face. The first, I can deal with, but I'm seriously considering some kind of attached shield to deal with the second problem. All in all, the saw cuts a mean swath through anything, and I'm glad I bought this model."
2,Doesn't quite make it,"Bought this saw because of the left-hand blade, but have only used it infrequently (prefer my DeWalt 364), for the following reasons:1. Despite the ""15 AMP"" rating, the saw is a bit underpowered (when compared, for example, to the DeWalt).2. Awkward balance, and tends to wander in the cut, but maybe this is the result of just being more accustomed to using a conventional right-hand blade saw.3. Dust port is an annoyance. It's not practical to hook this up to a vacuum for most jobs, and if it's not in place, the dust gets all over the work and the user, as compared to a right-hand saw with rear sawdust discharge. PLUS -- you have to remove the dust port in order to get the saw back into the storage case.Summary: Scrape up more $ and get the DW 364. The difference is like night and day."
3,Time Will Tell,"I just bought this saw to replace my DW364 which is giving me some problems. I like the weight and the left sided blade, something I have always wanted. With all of the light weight materials, I wonder if this saw will endure daily construction use. The carrying case is a joke and will be replaced by one with adequate room."
5,Great Saw,"Excellent saw. If you're a right-handed person used to a right hand blade, it will take a little while to get used to a left hand saw, but once you do, it's a great improvement. Dust port is a god-send especially when working with MDF and other dusty ""woods"". Typical Porter-Cable balance and finish quality. The best saw I found and I tried them all."
5,"Light Weight, Great Balance","Great saw. I'm a righty and really like the left hand blade for visibility (especially cutting sheets). But what really sold me on this saw was the ""feel"". You can't pick this out from a spec sheet but you know it when you use the tool. Let me say that I'm normally a HUGE Milwaukee fan, so that's the first place I went when I needed a new saw. They looked great and had some nice features but then I tried one. For me, the grip and balance of the Porter Cable felt a lot better.I also picked up a dust bag and was surprised at how well it worked. It's a little annoying hanging out there but it really catches a lot of dust (nice for working inside people's houses)."
5,Godsent for South Paws,"Somebody ought to give PC a medal for catering to the largest minority group in the world - lefties. PC is permanently on my MFTC (Most Favorite Tool Companies) list because of this. I wish more manufacturers would offer leftie versions of their popular tools or else design tools that are more ambidextrous.Better ergonomics for lefties aside, the 743K's lightweight is a big plus, particular for ""in-the-air"" cuts like trimming rafter ends and roof sheathing. The magnesium frame is rigid and rugged, as is the lower blade guard, which is easy to hold retracted for plunge-cuts.My only wish is that the spindle lock used when changing blades is a little easier to use, but really though that doesn't get used often enough to bother me. I'm not sure the blade brake version is worthwhile, but I may give it a try on my next purchase."
5,Awesome Saw!!!!!,"I am a right-handed novice woodworker, and this is the best circular saw I have ever used. I have tried right-handed blade mounted saws before, and I could never cut very straight. I was able to cut extremely staight the first cut with this saw. It has plenty of power too. Using the blade as a guide is the way to go."
1,I miss the first movie.,"A cheap B grade follow up to a Van Damme classic. Sony, please don't destroy a great classic. At least you can remake this flim properly like Karate Kid. And watching two uncles flight (Van Damme and Lungren) is no fun. I am extremely dissapointed!"
2,Luc warm,"With Dolph Lundgren getting killed at the end of Universal Soldier via some sort of farm machinery, how was he brought back? In Universal Soldier 2, Luc had adapted to being human once again, but now he has no memory? Are we supposed to ignore the previous movies?Ignoring the previous plots and story line, modest B or C action movie."
2,What happened to Van Damme's character,"Who ever wrote this screen play, didn't see the first two movies. His character in this movie was screwed-up. Why was he being reintroduced back into society again? This movie could of picked-up after the 2nd movie. He could have been asked by the government for help, because of his past encounters with his two adversaries?"
3,It's OK,"I suggest renting this movie,not buying it. It's a B rated movie and not the best story line."
1,if you think Iron Man 2 was better than Iron Man 1 (This is your movie!!!!!!!),"1.) if you want to just see violence! Fast forward to the last 18 min. (it is just a non stop fight scene for 18+ min, after about 14 min it got really boring)2.) if you want any kind of a plot (get another movie!)Just think ""x rated B type movie, and replace the sex with violence""3.) The first universal solder had a plot (I know, not much, but it had some), this one; not so much!4.) In the end, did they kick the bad guys ass (Not sure?) seems like the really bad guy kick the bad guys ass and squeezed his head, so ?? but the good solder Jean Claude fights the bad solders for 15 to 18 min. and yes he kicks their ass.I have to say it actually became boring. I know action = boring??? If you don't believe me just watch it."
1,"What a Waste (Nuclear, That Is)!!","More than ten years after the original, we are bombarded with this piece of nuclear waste. Van Damme and Lundgren look old beyond their years. The ""star"", Andrei ""The Pitbull"" Arlovski acts on one level--dead. There is so much killing, mayhem, explosions, etc. ad nausem, that one could not find a plot if there ever was one.Well, at least I can use the plastic case for some other DVD."
4,Van Damme's Return,"Can you ever get tired of fight scenes with Jean Claude Van Damme or Dolf Longren? Didn't think so. Here's a different side of Van Damme - still plenty of fighting but he's older now - gone are the characteristic splits and screams as he returns from a nearly loosing all. You know what I mean - it's in every one of his films. Hear, there's a more sensitive side, getting in touch with his feelings Van Damme. Not what you expect? Ok, so imagine a raging bull with a soft side. Better? Still, cinematically and plot - a good return to the Universal Soldier genre."
3,Not for Dolph Fans,"First off the movie drags alot, Van Damme looks old, and I know he is but geez he moves slowly in this movie.Second, I mainly just wanted to watch this because I loved how Luc and Ssgt. Scott fight each other. Plus I love Dolph!!But Dolph is only in the movie for like 10min. Gets killed with barely a fight, There are no Quirky liners from SSgt. ScottHe's not as psychotic, just very sad and the fight between him and Van Damme was just as sad. Plus the slick back hair do, not a good look for DolphThe storyline was okay. I see that the new Universal Soldiers that's coming out in 2011 is made by the same director. I hope he does betterespecially since both Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are going to be in it."
4,The BEST of the Unisol Series and Possibly the BEST film for Van Damme or Lundgren,"The title really says it all. Granted, both Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme aren't really on screen as much as one of their typical films but it really, really works.The plot is simple but effective. The action is outstanding, ultra violent and rarely stops. And it's not old school action either. There's a taste of the Bourne series in some of these shoot-outs. Big marks for Director Hyams. Can't wait to see what he does next!"
3,It's okay.,"This game is okay. But, as some people said, it is easy to blow it during a game i.e. foul. But, for the visuals, it is perfect. It is better than the previous FIFA game. Overall, it is okay but with some improvements on it in the future games."
3,sorry didnt make the cut,"right ive been playin fifa since 1994 unlike the french fan of 98, u know when they were little 2d guys runnin after a white dot but instead of gettin better it just got worse, dont get me wrong its a good game but its WAY TOO EASY u know a match would like end 7 5 way too much for football thats how soccer might be played over in america but thats not real soccer so games like winning eleven and this is football are way better sorry ea id stick with madden and live if i was u"
3,The ugly stepsister of the beautiful game...,"EA has some great sports games. The Fight Night series and Madden NFL are good examples. Simply put, this is not one of the great ones.The FIFA licenced leagues and players are the best feature. The graphics are good, and the menus are nice. The music is really good. The stadiums fail to impress. The first touch concept is right-on, but the controls don't deliver. The players are stiff and the physics are lackluster. The AI is more artificial than intelligent.Winning Eleven has much better games. Do you want füsball or fütbol?"
5,This Game is the best soccer game ever,"First I want to clear something Rodrigo you place your review in the Playstation 2 FIFA 2005 and if you do not have a good computer and the game does not run well in that crappy computer doesn't mean that has to be bad for everybody, some of us like it so don't tell anybody a false review.Leaving that topic this game is improving everything there are more leagues more playable option, te career mode is exceptional, there some people that said Winnig eleven is better but let's face it this game has more leagues and all the names on all the teams are real, in the winning eleven game more than fifty percent of the players are not real.So you better buy this one. you will not be dissapointed with this game, Is the best soccer game ever"
5,This game will be a lot of more fun !!!!!!!!,"I'd have Fifa 2004 and Fifa 2003 for PlayStation 2, the both are pretty fun but I think this game will be a lot more realistic than the other games about Soccer around all games.It's more realistic, harder and have more teams to play.if you like soccer and see the games of the leages of Spain, Italy or England you would see the realistic of this game."
1,13 x 4 does not equal 100,"The cover of this CD has 100 in a oval above the words ""No. 1 Hits"", which would lead most prospective buyers to the conclusion that this CD contains 100 recordings that reached the number one position on a sales chart. However, the package contains four CDs, each containing 13 cuts, for a total of 52 recordings, or only about half of the 100 hits a buyer would be looking for. In addition, many of the recordings on the CDs may have been number one hits somewhere (Paraguay, perhaps), but they certainly weren't in the USA. Booooooooo!"
5,A Simple Book of our Secret Inner Strength,"Told as a series of simple letters, this book is remarkable for how much it awakens our inner soul to the possibilities that exist within ourselves."
4,His best since he left Cash money.,I have all B.G.'s Cds I'm from New Orleans and I been a fan if you want hardcore gutta street music B.G. is ya man and this CD is his best work since he left Cash Money Records.
4,this is really good,b.gizzle is one of my fav rapppers in the dirty south the heart of that streetz is a raw album bg.g did his thing agin and if you like this album go and buy all of b.gizzle other albums they all hot and b.gizzle puts out some of the realist music out hes talks about how he came up in da hood and all kinds of other shhhhh but yeah this album is worth your money and i cant wait till his new his other new album come out its called the heart of tha stretz vol.2 and he's droping his true story dvd
4,The Heart Of The Streetz Is His Best Album Ever.,This album is perfect but some beats are bad like ''Get Up'' and ''Get Ya Game Up''.
2,hate to do this but...,"I'm a hardcore B.G. fan. I'll copp anything from lil whoadie.Is this first cd of B.G. you are consdering buying?STOP!!!Go back to the previous cds...get ""Checkmate"" for your first B.G. purchase.Then purchase backwards until u buy ""True Story"". THEN get ""Heart of the Streets"".Too many of the beats here suck. Its just pitiful...maybe people in the N.O. like that BS.At last B.G. is workin with Mannie fresh again...i'm waitin on that ""It's All on U Vol.3"""
1,The worst B.G album ever,"I'm not hating on Gizzle, I think he's one of the best rappers from the south. However this CD fails misreably on every level. It's just not the same as his previous albums. There are a couple decent tracks and some good production and that saves it from being worse but it's still not a good album. B.G has shown that he can make a good album without Cash Money as prooven by Livin Legend and Life After Cash Money but maybe he should consider going back if he's going to put out trash like this. I hear he might be signing to G-Unit soon and I hope this is true so he can make a better album and get more recognition. Sorry Gizzle but this just didn't work for me. If you want a good B.G album get Chopper City In The Ghetto. Hell get any of his previous albums, but don't get this."
3,Not to bad,He always has something good to say but here there are a lot of generic beats he did pretty good lyrically but all the songs can sound like the same.But his lyrics are pretty hot on this LP.And this may be one of the Top 50 LP's of 2005.
2,The Heart Of Tha Streetz,This is one of the worst Cd's that i have purchased in a long time. Dont waste your money on this cd.
5,"An emotional, visceral, deeply human voice","These are the sounds and images we need from poetry, and find too seldom -- finely wrought passages of beautiful yearning, with a flat naturalism that is compelling and achingly true. Accessible on multifarious levels, these poems show us life on the inside of man -- a haunting look at times, but affirming in its struggle to survive on its own terms. ""American Crawl"" is fine storytelling -- and finer art."
2,alone together,"Richard Stoltzman is a virtuose clarinetist and his popular works rewards him with public recognition. In this Cd, however, he is playing ""above"" the quartet and his proverbial show-off brilliancy gives off radiance and unreality to Brahms depth and subtlety textured compositions. This Cd seems an exotic piece of a great showman clarinetist"
4,Better than a white wall,"The white wall was so good a screen surface, that I delayed purchasing a screen for several months. It is not much brighter an image, but the contrast is so much richer. The blacks are blacker, the reds are redder...you get the idea. I think it is a worthwhile investment. The box was damaged in shipping, which dented the outer case. The screen was fine, so I kept it, but you may want to be more careful with UPS shipments!"
5,having a great time,Listening to this album you are going to have great time at office or school.Excellent gift.
1,Big Misunderstanding,"Not at all what I was led to believe. Somewhere in the promotional blurb I read that this was the theme music from Murder One. If so, they watched a completely different Murder One program than I did.Extremely disappointing.Herb Crowhurst"
1,Looks can be deceiving,Bought this for my grandson Christmas 2011. He was all excited - loves pirates more than dinosaurs. Nice wooden pieces and a good size for pre-schoolers. However - pieces come off easily - with little movement. We even tried gluing the masts and other pieces into their respective holes but even then they pop out when the boat is moved. Maybe if the holes were deeper it would work better but then the boat would have to be made of thicker wood. Disappointing.
2,no pirates included; cannons do not fire,"There are no pirate figures included. The cannons do not fire (which is the one thing most desired by my son!) We decided to return it and buy one from a different company (which was smaller and made of plastic, but included pirate figures and cannons that fire -- my son loves it). The company IDigToys does not have a good return policy: they charge a 20% restocking fee. I will not purchase any products from this company in the future."
2,Ripstik Board,"I purchased this board for my 20 year daughter's birthday, hoping she could use it to get around her campus with it. I was first looking into standard skate boards but choose this after reading in the reviews how easy and fun the Ripstik was. Well, after 2-3 days of attempting to stay on she has given up. She bikes and snow skis so it is not like she is not athletic. Therefore, I would caution against buying it for someone unless you are sure they will be able to ride on it. Alas it will be gathering dust in my garage!"
5,"Awesome Ride, Fast Speed!!!","This is a great product, I enjoy every moment of riding it!!! I got hooked on it like, 2 years ago when my best friend got it! There's thrill in every second riding it, and a constant adrenaline rush!!! This is so much fun, I would really advise anybody who likes fast, fun and thrilling rides to consider riding a friend's and/or buying it!!! I seriously love it!!!"
3,Wait! Don't buy here. Target price is $69 any color!,"I bought one from Amazon for $89.00 and received it last week. Target and other stores are REALLY selling them for $69 each, any color. Amazon advertises them for $69, but they really don't have any for that price. After 25 minutes on the phone with customer service trying to get her to honor a refund of $20, she told me there were no supervisors available to discuss the issue and she gave me a $10 refund because I have a good purchase history. HISTORY IS RIGHT!"
2,Does not come with two extra wheels as it says it would,"The product features says that the board comes with ""Value Pack includes two extra wheels"" however it does not.Product FeaturesGroundbreaking caster board that acts like a skateboard/snowboard hybridPivoting deck and 360-degree caster trucks enable snowboard-like carvingSpiked traction pads, kick tail and nose, and concave deck design76mm polyurethane wheels and precision ABEC-5 bearing casters; Value Pack includes two extra wheelsDesigned for riders age 8 years and up; supports up to 220 pounds"
5,best mobile product on the market,"i had been wanting this ripstick for about 3months. finally when it got here i was over the edge happy took it outside and hit the road, hard at first but great feeling about 2months later my dad ran over my ripstick and i almost cried bought another one that night and was happy again yippee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Wrong for my sons age,I ordered at my sons request for his birthday. He was turning 7 and I didn't realize they made different sizes and I bought the larger one. He is physically incapable of riding it. I will order the right size or get him something else.
5,RipStik,I was very satisfied with the end product. I play on it all the time . It came on time and was in great condition thanks.J.P.
4,Ripstik Rolls!,My son asked for this product after trying out a friends'. He couldn't wait to get it out of the box and still spends time with it a month later...my only complaint is that it is much harder to control than a bike or scooter and there have been several instances when he has had to jump off to avoid a crash.....not the best toy to use on neighborhood streets....
5,It's better than a skateboard!,"I got the the ripstik and it's awesome!First of all it's easy to master and it's easier to use than it looks.If you have some trouble to decide whether to get a skateboard or a ripstik ,choose the ripstik.Second of all, it's very quick and you don't have to jump to turn.You can even go uphill by doing a furious twist.I have fallen of it once or twice,but it's very easy and fun to ride.Thanks for reading this review! Ripstik > skateboard"
5,Great for kids,"My Daughter loves this.My Daughter and her friends play with them all day, great for the summer break."
5,A FABULOUS GIFT FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER!,MY GRAND DAUGHTER WAS SO EXCITED WITH HER NEW RIPSTIK!! She loves it and can't wait to get outside and use it when the snow clears!
5,ripstick,I love this. My favorite gift from Christmas and I have been ripstick ing in my house cuz we just got a blizzard.
5,Great Product; Great Amazon Delivery.,"Delivery of the Ripstick was great and my son has been enjoying it since day 1. Well made and very sturdy. Overall, I can not give it a low rating."
4,RipStik Caster Board,I bought this for my son for his 12th birthday. He loves it and is very happy with it.
5,Perfect gift for a 10 yr old!,I bought this for a Bday present for my 10 yr old and he absolutely loves it. He was never a big skate boarder but loves this. He picked up the basics in about 1/2 a day.
5,really fun,"this Ripeskate is very fun, but also can be really dangerous, my daugtherloves it, just make sure your child uses the proper security equipment."
4,great toy,"The kids love this thing and will spend hours on end on it. It takes a little bit of time to master, but after a few hours they were off and running. Even around the neighborhood, they'll ride this before a skateboard because they don't have to push. The only negative I have about it is the wheels wear down quickly. We've had it for two weeks and we need to replace the back wheel."
2,What they don't say before you buy,"What they don't say before you buy is that you can expect to eat up wheels with this board. A 16 year old at 150 pounds ate up the wheels that came with the board in under two weeks.When contated to ask why, the company immediately blames the inexperience of the rider and tells you to buy more wheels. At $12-$20 per set of replacement wheels, the additional costs mount up quickly. The purchase price is only the start with this product. If your going to buy this, you must also purchase additional wheels. Otherwise the board will sit idle until you can get them.That having been said, the board is otherwise enjoyable and fun to use."
5,Ripstick Product Review,"Ripstik Product ReviewSo heres what a great thing about this product, so first of all you can do tons of tricks on it. They're so fun to comply you get way proud of yourself then you face another trick it's awesome.Also if you hate the color red or blue you can get several more color I will name a couple pink, black, green, yellow, orange, white and purple plenty of more. By the way I got angry because I fell on my butt and I through my ripstik on the concrete like six times and it still did not brake.Now for the bad things so if you don't have balance you will fall right on your face so be careful. We are done with that. So heres another flake just kidding theres no more.So if you want balance get this product purple, white, blue, green, red, yellow. It has good material so it doesn't brake. If you like grinding this is the wrong product for you Thanks."
5,My son loves it.,"This is the second ripstik I bought for my son. The first ripstik is the basic one and this one is upgraded level. The price is higher than the basic one. However, I son loves it."
5,Ripstick way cool,The whole family loves it! Very challenging..have to reallyPractice!! Hopefully will help with snow boarding skills!8 years and up I would say!
5,Great buy,My 10 year old nephew LOVES the ripstick! He and his friends use it constantly and particularly love to use it indoors where it does not mar any type of floor.
5,Great way to spend summer,"when you first get the ripstick it is challenging to learn how to ride but when you know how to ride it, it is super fun! then you can start doing tricks."
5,Ripstick a Winner,"My 12 year-old daughter spends half her summer days on her Ripstick. Great fun (and good for core-muscle development to boot)! She pretty much ""got it"" on the first go, unlike her younger sister who is not as strong .. took sis longer. Comes with DVD, mostly safety tips and a few demos. My daughter was too impatient to watch, just put her helmet on and got on her board. No probs. Happy Mom"
4,very nice product and awesome service from amazon.com,"very nice product and awesome service from amazon.comshipping was fast, no issues. the ripstick was in a perfect shape and my daughter loves it.thanks!"
5,Cool,"I finally bought my own Ripstik after playing with my friend's for a long while. Works great, came in good packaging. What more is there to say? A Ripstik is a Ripstik."
3,Great board - but not for young ones,"Bought this for Christmas for my 7-1/2 yrs old. He was really excited and couldn't wait to hop on, unfortunately he ended in a really big crash. It's extremely hard and as soon as you step on you're falling right off again. It's very important to read the manual and to view the riding tips DVD before starting. It now lives in a closet and my son has no interest in it. Maybe when he's 10."
3,Ripstik Shipping,"5 stars for the Ripstik...1 star for the shipping. I ordered a Ripstik for my son's 9th birthday. It was shipped from California to Florida. Thankfully, the Ripstik arrived undamaged. The box it arrived in was another matter. It was crushed and torn almost completely open on both sides of the flimsy box and didn't have any packing materials to cushion the Ripstik at all. The Ripstik was completely exposed...fortunately, all parts and directions were still included and the Ripstik wasn't broken. My son LOVES his Ripstik and has become ""professional"" riding it everywhere."
5,my daughter loves it!,My daughter adores her new pink ripstik. She can't wait for the snow to melt so she will be able to use it outside and not just in the garage! I would absolutely recommend it. The delivery was fast.
5,Exciting to Watch,"I purchased two boards for my granddaughters (1 is 9 and the other 11). My 11 year old, with a great sense of balance, has the RipStik well under control while the 9 year old is having some difficulty. However, they are both thrilled with their RipStiks and spend hours riding them. It's a winner."
5,For 11 year old boy,My older son had one but the 11 year old played with it more often. He really wanted his own and a green one which we couldn't find in a store. Got this one here for even a better price than in a store. Fast delivery.
4,Ripstick Board,"I recently purchased this for my son for Christmas. There was a ""instructional DVD"" with the board. That wasn't much help. It is very tricky to learn how to use, but with persistence he mastered how to turn and even to go faster on his own."
5,Great Shipping,The shipment was fast and the Ripstick was well protected inside. This is the second Ripstick I owned and it rides just at smooth as the first.
5,best ripstik ever,best ripstik ever.I got it on monday and could ride perfectly already by wensday.I would highly recomend this for all ages ecept for under six.The only thing is dont ride over big things or else it will flip.
5,Gift for grandson,"Our 7 year old grandson was thrilled with this at Christmas. Unfortunately, Atlanta had snow so he hasn't had a lot of time to practice. We purchased the knee and elbow pads along with it and it was a huge hit. Having it delivered to our door was a big plus as well."
3,good but not the best,The ripstick is good but if i were you i'd buy the wave board for 5 more bucks. i think the makers named it a ripstick because it was a HUGE rip off of the wave. i own a wave board and i have tried a wave board and like the wave so take my advice BUY A WAVE!!!!!!!!
5,crazy fun,ohhhh man this thing is cool i bought it for my son but he is just a little bit small for it so i have to show him how to ride it this thing is cool once you learn how to balance on it
3,rip stick too hard to master,"Bought rip stick for 10yr old grandson, he just couldn't master it and we had to return it. Just way too hard to balance on the two wheels, very frustrating for someone his age who is just learning to skateboard.Ripstik Caster Board"
2,What they don't say before you buy...,"What they don't say before you buy is that you can expect to eat up wheels with this board. A 16 year old at 150 pounds ate up the wheels that came with the board in under two weeks.When contated to ask why, the company immediately blames the inexperience of the rider and tells you to buy more wheels.

If your going to buy this, you must also purchase additional wheels. Otherwise the board will sit idle until you can get them.That having been said, the board is otherwise enjoyable and fun to use."
1,Good product..Very dangerous!!!!!,"Well, i bought one for my son for his 14 year old birthday, he loved it!But, he got hurt on it and got 8 stitches in his chin! and his friend broke his arm on one of these!Well, thats dangerous for you,but it would be a good product if it wasnt dangerous."
5,absolutely brilliant,"The product itself is brilliant we purchased one each for our daughters and they absolutely love them.It gets them out of the house and is very good exercise.They are easy to ride and great for the whole family, our youngest girl is six and she is loving it and riding confidently on her own. Overall excellent gift for anyone and the service was great from time of order i had them in four days and much cheaper then getting them locally thankyou amazon BRILLIANT."
3,Not for little kids,"After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to get my 8 year old daughter a Ripstik instead of a regular skateboard for her birthday. Big mistake. She is a pretty agile kid and is really good on both her bike and scooter, but this thing is really tough for her. I can barely stand on it for a few seconds without falling over, and I'm in great shape! She has tried and tried, but cannot seem to get the hang of it so I am going to put this baby away for a few years and buy her a junior skateboard instead. I think the Ripstik age range is a little off and maybe more appropriate for older kids and adults."
2,Good for a week,Bought this for my son. He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week. Then the wheels broke. He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway. The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable.
3,Gift,I looked over the ripsticks and they looked great...too dangerous for me but I am sure my grandsons will enjoy them after the Holidays.
3,think twice before buying,"Made very well however, my 10 year old had a hard time with it. She said it was to hard to learn. She said she wished she had asked for a new skateboard instead for christmas. It will take alot of time for her to learn and definitely wear a helmet. I think it is one of those toys that some kids will either pratice forever or it will stay in the closet. We have decided to purchase her a new skateboard."
1,Return policy for this item is TERRIBLE!,"Amazons return policy for this item is RIDICULOUS! We purchased what appeared to be the perfect board, it was too small, and they want to charge us a 25% restocking fee plus 3 rounds of shipping. I will NEVER order a item like this from AMAZON ever again. Buyers be warned."
5,My kids love these!,"I bought this for my daughter's eighth birthday. We have several others in the garage for the older children. She loved the color and is so glad to have her own. We have had to replace wheels, but nothing else on all the ripstiks we have owned. They kids play with them frequently."
5,it is great because you can showoff,"i really like the ripstik because you never have to keep pushing off the ground for more speed like you do for a skate board or scooter. you can just keep floating along on your piece of moving ground. the only problem is that its hard to learn, but that only adds to your bragging rights when you master it."
2,Wheels break too fast,"I was really annoyed when only after an hour of riding it, the front wheel shattered. I called up the Ripstik company and they sent me some free wheels, but the problem there was they were the same wheels that shattered! If you purchase this ripstik you should also get a pair of better wheels. I recommend the WAVE wheels. They have better bearings and much better speed and quality."
5,Fast delivery of fun!,"I love my RipStik, and it got here just in time for me to RipStik down the halls of the Engineering Building during finals :P"
4,This is for 11 and up,"Ok... this thing is a mix between a skateboard and a Rollerblade. My 11 year old step-son got it for his b day and loves it. It took him a bit to learn how not to fall off but when he got the hang of it, he was doing great.WARNING: Your child will fall off of this thing no matter what so be prepared. Have them wear safety gear to avoid anything serious."
3,This is NOT a book!,"please take note, while the material included in this is good enough, it is NOT A BOOK.it is a twelve page instructional brochure like the kind you buy in the craft stores in those racks. You know, next to the candle making supplies which are mentioned in the brochure so you are certain to buy their brand of supplies.I am going to go to the craft store and find out how much this costs new in the shop. 7.99 seems high for 12 pages."
4,Very nice!,"I was lucky enough to see James Hill perform last year, and was happy to find this cd. This is not ""standard"" uke. Hill does a great job finding new ways to play this instrument."
4,Reading Rocks!,Great book for readers just past the beginner stage. Besides reading practice I like the values and topics that the stories are based around.
4,kids book,My kids like the Berenstain Bears and this book was no exception. I thought it was okay but thought it could have been longer.
1,Shocked when I opened this book,"My 2 year old daughter handed me a copy of this book. When I started to read it, I was shocked. I grew up loving the Berenstain Bears. As an adult I have become painfully aware of the biases towards mothers or women in society. This book lower Poppa bear to the level of children or worse. Why should we indoctrinate our children from a tender age that mothers make sure things get done and dads are lazy bums? I for one will not be reading Berenstain Bears books to my children in the future. This book could have easily be written without applying a negative stero-type of men."
1,No lesson taught,"I've loved Berenstein Bear books since I was little, and as a parent I love that they teach a lesson. This book showed that if they don't do their chores then the house is a mess but it never got around to teaching the lesson, such as sitting down and discussing the problem and assigning kids chores, etc... I was VERY disappointed. It just didn't follow the character of the previous books. Thumbs down!"
3,"Great message, but artwork is lacking","I'm a longtime fan of the Berenstain Bears and have a huge collection that my 4 and 5 year olds now enjoy. I purchased some new books for the collection, and this was one of them. I really liked the point they were making, but the drawings didn't look like the Bears I'm used to. I'm assuming this might have been one of the last books before Stan passed away, so maybe that is why they don't look quite right. Otherwise, I appreciated the message that everyone needs to pitch in to help mom keep the house clean."
4,The Chore of not doing your Chores,"In another classic book featuring the Berenstain Bears, children are taught important lessons, in a fun and humorous way.Momma Bear gets annoyed when nobody else is doing any household chores, so she decides to join her family in slacking off. The kids and father soon see the error of their ways when they are forced to face the reality of living in a dirty home. They all then take appropriate action, and do their chores.My kid loves this book, just as I did when I was young. I wish I had more books of the series to share with her.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."
1,My Zojirushi SFBAE12ST Tuff Wide Lost Vac. in 8 months,"My tuffwide is BETTER as it lost vac. after eight months, as other users lost vac. within six months.I only use it for dozen of times. Probably, it has design error, as it failed suddenly (even I took good care of it -- never battered, drop on the ground). Be careful, if you are planning to buy one."
1,Lost vacuum after six months,"My tuffwide lost vac. after six months in service.Sad, really. I have one over twenty years old that still works. Battered, missing a handle, but can tell hot from cold.Like the design on this one and had hopes. Amazon, of course, points out that if it had failed in 30 days... I am on my own and plan to fill the former vac. cavity with low expansion foam. Otherwise, it functions well as a hot water bottle."
3,They Tried!!!,"The O'Jays tried to follow up the success of ""So Full Of Love"" with ""Identify Yourself"" and it just didn't work. They did have 2 very good songs in ""Sing A Happy Song"" and "" Forever Mine"", but the rest of the album is just there. What can I say, they tried!!!!"
2,Beat the House 2 Beats Me,"I have had Beat the House before on my ealier computer and it was a great game to play, I really did enjoy it. That is why I bought Beat the House 2, but unfortunately it would not work on my new computer which has a later version of Windows, Windows XP. It works on Windows 98 so I gave it to my daughter. This is not a good version to get unless the company puts in a patch to make it workable for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.I rated it high for fun because the games it has are good and enjoyable but I rated it I don't like it overall because I can't play it on my computer.a good Video Poker Web site is: [...]which at least has a great version of Video poker as well as other games to play."
3,Beat the House 2,This game is ok but I think Beat the House 1 is better but the price was great so I'm happy with it.
1,A waste of money,Buyer Beware! This is a reprint of a very hard to get copy of a classic book about the Arizona/Mexico desert and the experiences of William Hornaday in the early 1900s. The problem is the book was copied from perhaps the original and there are pages missing...not just a few but many and at critical places. It seems to me that it would have not been to difficult for the publisher to correct the problem before publication. I intend to search used dealers and secure a copy in that manner. This is a real poorly done publication and not worthy of the readers time or hard earned money.
2,Okay book,"I was really looking forward to this book. It's a lot shorter than I expected. Only 147 pages. I didn't think it was very well written. There are a lot of typos. It seems like the author or editor didn't proof read it. It's a good story, but the author tries to build up suspense and you can see right through it. It seemed to be written at a middle school level. This is a book to check out at the library, not to buy."
2,Lentil Clumps,"Cooks unevenly, large clumps. You must stop heating halfway through to stir. Distinctly metallic taste."
3,The One That Started It All,"I can only give this piece three stars because many of the techniques detailed are now obsolete via new technologies.But this book is truly a classic in the now cluttered ""revenge"" genre.Santoro describes how to set up a systematic campaign of revenge against an enemy while staying anonymous.Santoro has gone on to write other similar works and all are based on the themes described in this work. He also updated this particular book in 1999 to adapt his techniques to modern phone systems and the internet (""21st Century Revenge: Down and Dity Tactics for the Millennium"").There is a ""Part II"" to this work, which was written by George Carpenter. In that piece, the revenge tactics require the perpetrator to sacrifice some anonymnity and risk exposure. It is also an absolutely hilarious work. The chapter ""Trashing a House in Thrity Minutes,"" is a revenge classic in it's own right."
1,I can't believe that a book like this got published,"This is basically a manual for how to consistently stalk and harrass someone to ruin their life, how to avoid anyone catching you, and how to stop anyone believing your ""target"" when they try to tell anyone about it. You would have to be mentally ill to want to carry out these things against someone and create an unrelenting campaign of violence against them which they can't prove. Anyone who buys this book and uses these tactics needs to face up to the fact that they ARE A STALKER and a weak, manipulative coward who doesn't have an actual life of their own."
5,fuse,"I had a small floresent lamp over my laundry area and it quit. I bought another cheaper unit and it buzzed so bad I decided to take apart the old unit and found it had a blown ""little fuse"". Your replacement is still in use after at least two years."
4,Thought provoking and disturbing,"The life of eight year old Burton Rembrandt is brought to us through his eyes and voice, and what a story it is. While seemingly normal in so many ways, there is also a profoundly troubling element to his young life. After a traumatic event occurs, Burton is sent to the ""Children's Trust Residence Center"" for treatment. Burton's behavior and motivation proves to be baffling for the staff, with the exception of one young Doctor who tries to help and befriend him. This is a profound and unsettling little book, that will make you painfully aware of how fine the line is between normal and disturbed."
2,Spoiler Warning,"This is an extremely weird book. At first I didn't like it. The whole novel discusses something that Burt did to Jessica. I wanted to discover what that was, so I kept reading. It's discovered that Burt and Jessica had sex, but they're only eight. Which is weird. It's not ""dark"" or ""twisted"" like it has been described to be many times. Most of the time I just skipped to the end of the paragraph because Buten goes on and on about some uninteresting, pointless perspectives that Burt has. This book should be YA. It was such an incredible waste of time."
1,Egalite.. Fraterinte.. French way.. boycott the movie!,I wish I knew it before watching it.This is most dissapointing and immoral post production situation.The teacher portrayed in this documentary did fantastic job for 7 month. He did not get A DIME from fillmakers who actually grossed 2 mil euro for it and when he asked to be compensated the French court refuesd as the documentary actors should not be compensated. ????What an idiocy!So how come the documentary makers are allowed to make profit on document? Should not it be divided fairly or on a flip.. nobody gets nothing?Egalite. Fraterninte.. French Way!
5,Great Album,This is a great Album but when will someone make this available on cassette I know it exsists on cassette and its a great compilation to but no one seems to have it on any format.
1,"Worked Great, Then In For Repair!","I purchased this from Amazon in December, and they are GREAT! The TV worked great, but then broke and has been in the local JVC repair shop for 4 weeks! I have never had a problem with JVC equipment before, but this one was a lemon!"
3,stop the insanity,"Can we please get someone to comment on this book other than people who obviously are holding a grudge against Sgt. Saar? Actually, there are comments people he didn't work with -- and they are all positive.Please, GITMO soldiers -- some of us actually want to know if they should buy the book or not. And when all you do is bash Saar and not the book, that makes it hard."
1,Total Left wing CROCK,"I have never read such absolute falsehoods in my life. This guy is out to make a buck on people that want us dead that are now being detained in Guantanamo.I notice the author did not divulge how many prisoners were released from Guantanamo only to be caught or killed committing terrorism again shortly after their release.If you want to waste several hours, you could read this book. Or you could wait for this author to be on his favorite left wing air head radio station on (dead) Air America Radio."
1,Buyer beware,"The vacuum system on this product is faulty. It seals fine, but it will not remove the air from the package prior to sealing. Don't waste your money."
1,Transformers Cybertron dvd review,ok for the story line and video its one of the best however one dvd is badanbd there is no exchanges and no support any manifactor defeictive disc will not be exchanged adn dealers are not allowed to give support. Hasbro is lazy on customer support. OI asked for help and what go bother some one else is there respondsI ro recomand the seriews of you enjoy Transformers. however Amazon did not help me out on my other account when I did ask for it. I guessI have to hunf around for deals out side and try to look around.I am not paying above full retail price on a product line is made in Mexico.Mexico dose not know how to make dvds. if this was not true I will not having so much problems trying to get help when I did ask for it
3,family friendly film,This is an older Disney movie that would probably appeal more to those who enjoyed it the first time around.
3,Third Man on the Mountain,"Great movie but why is Disney being so cheap-ass and not releasing any of these classic films (Old Yeller, Kidnapped, etc.) in either Blu-Ray or at least digital remastered versions?"
2,"Poor Adaptation,,,not a true story!!!","This movie is based on the book Banner in the Sky by James Rasmey Ullman. It is not based on a true story. In fact, the author goes to great lengths to point out that it is a FICTIONAL story before you even begin reading. I have taught the novel every year since 1998. I have read it over and over. It is very much fiction. That being said, this movie is a Disneyized version of a novel, and they follow the story about as well as their other adaptations; which is to say, not at all. The names are slightly the same, and there's a mountain in it, but that's pretty much where the similarities end."
3,Top Classic Disney Movie...but,"In few words... Third Man on the Mountain is a top classic Disney movie filmed on location in Zermatt, Switzerland but.......the Picture quality is not the best, just OK.Also big minus is: the DVD contains no bonus features which would be interesting (info about the real story, Making of etc.).Nice camaeo appearance by James MacArthurs real mother : Helen Hayes (one of the tourists leaving the hotel)."
4,"It's a Rom-Com, park your reality at the door","So, it's a Rom-Com, park reality at the door and enjoy the cartoon credits at the beginning.Alex is a staggeringly handsome man, and my following him since the days of Moonlight brought me to watch this film. He does comedy as well as he does ""angsty Vampire"". PLUS, sun doesn't bother this buff and cut goat farmer/cheese maker.I can take small doses of JLo, yet I will say she does her best. She needs to get some meatier rolls because at 40 (almost 41) she needs to do something other than this lightweight stuff.Get a bottle of wine, a quart of chunky monkey and enjoy the movie!I nominate this for the ""Hottest Scene involving a Pillow"" in a PG 13 movie."
1,The hair set the mood for me.,"Ok, so I am a big buff for little stupid romantic comedies, but JLo's hair was the hair style you would see on the ""auntie"" She is aged in this film, flat, and not sparky. The whole movie was sad, I did not even wait for it to finish. I was very disappointed. The hair set the tone for the film, which depicted bad casting, bad play, and most of all bad stylist. The film was really really bad. So bad, I left a movie review!"
3,Language offensive,"This movie, The Back-up Plan's story could have been told with much less foul language. For me it distracted from the story totally. Do people really talk like that?"
3,Love Alex O'Loughlin,This is a cute movie. I probably wouldn't have bought it if it didn't have Alex O Loughlin in it. He is so hot.
3,Sweet family feel good movie....,"I enjoyed this film...yes it can be considered predictable..silly..more of a movie made for TV..Yet I found it charming, fun, and a great escape from the normal routine of life for 90 minutes. Its a movie to just sit back..relax, laugh, and enjoy!"
2,Not good,"From my wife Sarah: All I kept thinking was - how could Jennifer Lopez have agreed to make this movie? It was boring, slow, silly and just completely unbelievable.Actually I don't even mind when a movie is unbelievable if it has something entertaining, interesting, funny or thought provoking. But this was a TERRIBLE script with lots of cliches. There were parts that were meant to be funny but were utterly rediculous. The romance part was absolutely unbelievable, and on a scale of 1-10, chemistry was about zero. Jennifer - you're so much better than that! I hope you'll have better movies in your future. Unfortunately I can't recommend this movie."
3,"A cute, if implausible, date movie","This is perfectly enjoyable for a date movie and light entertainment. Jennifer Lopez is very engaging, as is her co star O'Laughlin, in this story of a pet shop owner and an organic farmer who fall in love just as the woman discovers she's pregnant, as she had wanted to become a single mom and was inseminated.It's hard to believe that a pet shop owner could live in such a great home with tons of clothes and shoes and plenty of time off. It's also straining credibility that a man could fall so hard and fast for a pregnant woman.Otherwise, though, it is a cute and inoffensive movie."
2,This missed the mark on so many levels....,"I really love romantic movies, even the mushy ones. I can overlook slightly bad acting if the script is good. I can overlook a bad script if the acting is good. Then there is The Back-Up plan. This film was very bad on every level. There is a saying about bad acting - ""They phoned in the performance"". In this case I wish they would have because at least then I wouldn't have had to watch as well as listen to this horrible movie. I kept fast forwarding to try & find a part that was better. It was consistently bad throughout. I have seen both of these actors do some good work. What happened here? I didn't think Alex O'Loughlin was far enough along in his career to walk through a performance. I really enjoyed Moonlight and he was one of the leads in that. I have also enjoyed a number of other films with Jennifer Lopez. It is a mystery how one something can go this wrong."
1,Not JLo's best performance,"I mostly really like Jennifer Lopez movies. She's just cute as the dickens, and her hair is so pretty. I saw The Backup Plan a couple of weekends ago and it just wasn't up to her fun, playful standards. The writing was terrible. It made her and her co-star seem like robots out of the fourth grade (but with adult bodies, including reproductive capabilities and really, really fast-growing, relentless stubble). Their courtship was not credible, waaaay less so than any other JLo movie. I'm willing to sit through goofy entertainment, but this one was really a waste of my time. I should have used my time to floss my teeth instead."
1,seriously terrible.,"predictable and painful. Jennifer Lopez and whoever her co-star is have absolutely no chemistry. The plot is ridiculously stupid..The ending..the beginning...the middle...ugh. This movie is offensive to single women, pregnant women, single men, people in retirement homes, OBGYN's... and people in New York. 2 hours of my life I will never get back."
5,I love this Movie.,"I love this movie. It made me cry and laugh at the same time. I love this movie, I love this movie."
3,Predictable funny ...,Both partners can spend some time together watching this chick flick.It's not as funny as it thinks it's.
3,Squeamishly uproarious even though it's predictable,"This is a great movie for laugh out lout situations. Is a pregnancy really so tumultuous? There were plenty of scenes I felt squeamish about. I had to fast forward through a lot of them! They did, however, provide the element of surprise to what was a predictable plot. The other surprise was Hawaii 5-0 star playing the leading man. I'd watch this movie again with some of my girl friends just so we could all laugh. :)"
2,"Love Jennifer Lopez and she plays her character in The Back-up Plan well, but the movie lacks plot, surrounding cast.","I love Jennifer Lopez as an actress and as a musical artist. That being said, first of all... in this movie, she plays the character and part well, she is at her best. However, the supporting cast and surrounding characters are boring, the plot is flat, and her love interest does not play his role well either. The movie had potential, and it the first 15 minutes are pretty good, from then on, everyone else just sinks the ship."
3,Backup Plan -- had wished for better,"I saw this movie in the theatre and quickly realized it was just a vehicle for JLO. I was hoping for Alex O' to have a better and less predictible part because he is an actor with unused potential. Hopefully this would have been a break-out for him. His TV series ""Moonlight"" showed some of his ability, but it was cancelled for whatever reason.The ""Backup Plan"" made JLO just look simply silly and Alex a bit of scenery in this misdirected mess. It all could have been so much more.Yet, because I am a fan of Alex O'Loughlin, I will get this DVD for my collection and hope his future movies and TV will give him the chance to prove himself."
1,"awful, awful, awful",I went into this movie with low expectations. I know romantic comedies are predictable and cheesy. But this is one of the worst I have seen. I think I laughed once when the dog did something silly. Way over the top and I was almost insulted by all the stereotypical pregnancy jokes.
3,The Back-up Plan movie is meh!!!,"My review of this movie will be jaded, because i will watch any movie(good or bad)starring Alex O'Loughlin!!! The movie started out pretty interesting and then puttered out with parts that were not funny and very silly."
4,Back-Up Plan,"Great movie for those who love Jennifer Lopez, just mesmerizing. Was sort of slow moving at first, but, you can get 'caught up' in the plot."
3,Provides Heavy Encouragement for Using Birth Control,"If I hadn't already been turned-off by the whole idea of having kids before seeing The Back-up Plan, this movie definitely seals the deal. Seriously, they should show it in junior high school health ed classes to make teens desperately WANT to use birth control.That being said - and despite the ick factor of several moments in the film - it's pretty good as romantic comedies go. I wanted to see it because of the casting of Alex O'Loughlin and Jennifer Lopez. They did not disappoint. Alex came off as sincere and real, and Jennifer, as always, charming and a bit wacky. The script/dialogue was fairly well-written, and there were some laugh-out-loud moments. It wasn't my cup of tea - the opening animated segment alone almost made me turn it off, and the premise the whole movie is based on is just silly and uninspiring. But I still think it's worth seeing if only for the two lead actors. And the dog. :)"
1,HORRIBLE,Don't waste your time this is horrible and a waste of time. People who are giving this movie a 3 stars or above should be ashame of themselves.
1,Save your money it really is that bad in fact crap.,"I suffer from chronic illness so I look forward to watching engaging movies that help me cope with my lot in life. As the movie progressed I kept hoping that it would improve by the end the only improvement was that I will never have to watch it again. The script - crap, the acting - crap, and the money I paid for this piece of crap well why not round it off - crap."
2,What Were They thinking?,"What were they thinking? Obviously they weren't, with such a ridiculous film. The sad thing is it's a waste of good talent. JLo has great charisma on film and Alex O'Loughlin was hypnotic in Moonlight yet somehow managed to come across in this film as a real nerd. So many gimmicks in the film and an unbelievable 8th grade dialog and plot make this film simply unwatchable."
5,DVD Review,This DVD was for my daughter. She asked for it on her birthday. It came promptly when I ordered it. It was an excellent price compared to the stores. I will always get movies from Amazon. The movies come in good condition. Thanks Amazon.
5,A Wonderful Movie!!!!!,"This movie was wonderful, so sweet and so funny. The combination of these two very talented people Alex O'Loughlin and Jennifer Lopez was incredible. Both Alex and Jennifer added so much to this movie and their performance left you feeling so good. I would recommend this movie to anyone - this movie is a must see!!!!"
3,The Backup Plan,"An enjoyable romatic comedy, but the numerous times they were fighting vs. loving was tenuous by the time the end arrived."
5,"Always have a ""Back-Up Plan'!","The movie puts a nice spin on things happening backwards. The movie is breezily paced, tightly edited and effectively makes use of the Manhattan exteriors."
3,Scratches,"I got a used movie from them, but it said the movie was in very good condition. When I opened the case there were scratch marks all over the front that were really deep. Although it did not affect the actual movie, it was very unappealing. I think it was really in good condition instead of very good. Besides that I'm very pleased. It arrived on time."
3,average movie,"I rented this movie from my local redbox machine. It looked like a nice film when it was advertised in the theaters. I don't go to the movies beause it's to expensive , so I wait until I can rent them. This movie was average I didn't not see what the fuss was about. The scene when the mother was having a baby in the water pool was also disturbing, and could have been left out. The story line could have been better as well."
2,A little funny - a lot crude,"A few genuinely funny moments overshadowed by too much vulgar language and crude gags. J-Lo is bright and funny, but this project seemed beneath her. Not a good moral lesson for younger family members."
3,Cute but Predictable,"There were things I loved and things I hated.I loved the characters. Alex O'Louglin's character is ridiculously adorable. He is sweet and funny and, unfortunately, a guy that we wish we could all catch but few could get. Even Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly amusing. I didn't have high hopes for her, but was was better than I expected.I hated the plot. There were several things that were just so out of the blue and ridiculous that I just rolled my eyes and stopped watching for a few minutes. There was a definite lack of realism here. Only once or twice did I laugh because of the actual plot. Everything seems very much blown out of proportion.I was also rather disappointed with the ending. Terribly cliche and lame.The characters were the only thing that made the movie worth watching."
3,Could Have Been Better,"Crude? I agree, it was crude in places, especially the 3 year old breast feeding and the woman giving birth. Other parts were somewhat laughable as far as what women go through being pregnant. If you can't laugh about what it does to your body, let's face it, you'll just cry and be depressed. Same with having kids. The awful and the wonderful, and even when they're grown, it's the same story.Lopez wasn't her best, I agree. She seemed to be floating throughout the story with no real depth, but that's probably because the movie wasn't real deep either. $3.99 on demand was a fair price for a few hours.However, the better twist to the story would have been her boyfriend was the sperm donor. That would have made it far more heartfelt knowing the children were really his. What would be the possibilities? Endless."
5,Freakin Hilarious!!,You will laugh out loud! I think women and men who are close to or thinking about having a family will really appreciate this too.
4,"GOOD, JUST NOT GREAT","I had wanted to see THE BACK UP PLAN when it came out in the theaters but never made it. When I discovered my library had it, I quickly put it on reserve. The movie wasn't quite what I was expecting, though it was a cute. Great idea, I just wished they would have played out the initial meeting/romance more before jumping into being a couple faced with becoming parents. A little too unbelievable for me. They had some great ideas they could of expounded on but didn't. It all seemed a little too rushed to me. But regardless, it was a cute movie with great acting."
5,One of my faves,I really liked this movie and I have watched it too many times to count still makes me LOL. JLo is a great romcom actress
2,I love Jennifer Lopez but this movie was horrible,I bought this movie and wish it was only a rental because I won't be watching it again. I absolutely love Jennifer Lopez movies so I thought I would love this one as well but there was some scenes that were so vulgar I just couldn't enjoy this movie. There was absolutely zero chemistry with her and the leading man played by Alex. Very disappointed and would not recommend.
5,The Back-Up Plan,Bought this for my sister for her birthday..She really loved it..The movie is hilarious & keeps you entertained..I've watched it several times..
2,Decidedly average.,"This film seems to have all the right ingredients, but somehow they totally fail to gel. The storytelling is uneven, J-Lo is miscast, and overall I struggled to actually care enough about the characters. It's only an hour and three quarters long, but watching it felt like a chore. I didn't even properly watch it to the end, because it was obvious what was going to happen and I just didn't care enough to stick around for the details.Glad I only rented it."
2,Doing your reserch project 4/e... Judith Bell,"It's a regular scientific methodology book. Though you will find some schematic figures / graphics, most of pages has only text. About important topics (e.g. ""bias"", evidence based medicine) you will find a very little amount of informations. Nothing about statistics."
4,Great supplements,Came fast. Everything I wanted in a supplement. Have good energy and it was a reasonable price compared to our little towns health food store
4,Very good designers guide,"This book is very good R/C airplane designers guide. However, covering so many topics it could use some more pages and better organisation (the graphs are small and scattered trough the book in disorganized manner making them difficult to follow while reading explanations). Looking forward to next edition!"
3,good if you know what you are doing and have experience,"This books lacks organization of thoughts. It has a lot of information, but not well organized and not presented in amethodical way. Some of the graphs and charts are just horribleand difficult to read. If you keep at it and read the chaptersagain and again, you will begin to understand airplane design.Not really for a beginner."
4,Complicated,"If you are new to model aircraft design, this book could be way over your head. There are other books that are quite a lot easier to understand. If you are an advanced designer, this is hot stuff."
5,A Great Help to Design Your Own Airplane,"If you have some academic background of aerodynamics the book will be very easy to understand and use. It can help you design your very own airplane without worrying about very complicated aircraft design process. It includes all the rules of thumb that experienced RC flyers have learned in years.If you are very new to the aircraft and aerodynamics world this book might not be a good choice. In this case, you might need to ask an experienced flyer to explain you some chapters. However, there is a chapter in the book that gives all the approximate relations between different part of a plane. Just using that chapter you can finalize the airplane layout with no more calculations rather than multiplying!IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DESIGN A MODEL AIRPLANE GET THIS BOOK."
1,This book compleatly misleads people....,I have red this book and I think this book compleatly mislead people about Buddhism and Sri Lankan comunity. For a person who wants to find out more about Sri Lanka and Buddhism (The truth I mean) there are lots of books. I think that the Tamils who started the war and whole word knows it. Buddhists are normally peaceful people and Tamil Tigers and people who support them like this one hate Buddhists.....Please get a life....
1,"Long, boring passages about a womanizing wanderer","I'm a little surprised most people praise this book. In my opinion, the writing was boring at times. I actually glanced over pages. I actually thought the main character was a disgusting, murdering, womanizer. I do see the relevance between the great contrast of good and evil, but I'd rather read Stephen King's ""The Stand"" over again instead of reading this book."
5,ATE IT UP LIKE CANDY,"Loved every minute reading this book. Makes me ache with joy. Happy with sadness. I am part Narcissus, part Goldmund - we all are. Loved their love for each other. HESSE is so wonderful. The complexity of life he describes - so real, so true."
3,Needs more of Narcissus,"This book has tension and will keep you turning pages. However I found the character of Goldmund unbelievable and he began to get on my nerves, obviously he was a fantasy self image ofHesse himself.Hesse tends to period leftist intellectual dead ends (even this story has shadows of them) but still is a marvelous intelligent writer.It is quite a good read. As another reviewer pointed out the author gets bogged down a little bit too much in his own philosophy but nothing compared to authors such as Huxley or Saul Bellows.You will never forget the characters---for that it gets 3 stars. Best sellers have such formula stereotyped characters you only have a desire to forget them."
4,"Good book, but Siddhartha's better","I went into this book with higher expectations than I should have, but it was a good read nevertheless. Siddhartha is better both in philosophy and theme, but this has another perspective on finding your path. The problem arises when a novelist tries to describe art and attempts to define it with pure subjectivism. Another problem is using a priest as a philosopher of reason and logic, which is contradictory to his belief in mysticism and faith."
2,big let down.....,If I was going to be locked up for 10 years and they let me choose just one book to take with me I'd grab Siddhartha. So when I read the reviews of Narcissus&Goldmund; I couldn't wait.Now I find it hard to believe the same person wrote both books.N&G; is lacking in all respects and there is no ending - throughout the book there is a poorly defined attempt to create or illuminate a conflict (which is sloppy) and there is no resolution at the end. What an empty book. If this is Hesse's work then I wonder whom he stole Siddhartha from.
2,Disappointing,"This is a famous book purportedly dealing with the conflict between science and art. Narcissus is an austere monk striving for purity in thought and logic, while Goldmund is the artist reveling in the sensual pleasures of the world. I felt very cheated in reading this book. The book is filled with too many gratuitous descriptions of sex and the conflict of science and art is dealt too pedantically with oft-repeated, clichéd ideas. I found two novel insights in this book. One was that joy and pain can be depicted by the same lines and forms in art. The other was a description of Goldmund's feelings in a fish market and he is moved by the callousness of humanity in the face of these dying fish. It is not a new thought, but writers rarely touch this topic of the accepted human cruelty to animals that is carried on under the guise of survival."
4,living the mysteries of life,"The theme of this book is deeply philosophical and a familiar one by the author--the mystery, harmony and fluidity of opposites, form vs. matter, reason vs. passion, and yin vs. yang in life. Perhaps making peace, or coming to terms with the unknowable nature of life by living it the best way one could."
5,Read it.,"This is a must for everyone who wants to look beyond the borders of their ordinary life. Although after reading this book it may leed to more questions than you had upfront, it certainly makes you a richer person in the long run; at least that's how I feel."
5,Take your pick: Material/Sensual or Spiritual world?,"So are you spiritual? Are you in touch with the other side? Or do you just live your life sensually, in touch with the Earth, instinctual and materialistic? Are you Narcissus? Or are you Goldmund? This is the story of the two sides of human nature set in the backdrop of the path of two friends, Narcissus, the priest, a spiritual God-fearing man and Goldmund, the lover, the traveller, the artist. This book describes the experiences of the two friends in life and love and makes it clear that we all have a little bit of Narcissus and Goldmund inside of us...very nice..."
4,"Inspirational, but you have to be ready for it!","Narcissus and Goldmund is not a light read. Hesse's message isdifferent for every reader; the way it should be. The love, respectand enduring friendship of the two main characters speaks its own story; most of us are not whole beings, but need the qualities we lack in another to reach that goal. It is sad really, that each man was not complete, but beautiful that both realized what the other gave to him. I agree that the characters were arrogant and the descriptions at times lacking in vigor. Women were mere sex objects awaiting the presence of the beautiful Goldmund to satisfy their desires. This, I found to be a turn-off.The dull scenic descriptions and lack of action are purposely designed for more focus on the spiritual message. Happy Reading!"
4,A KISS Fan's Delight,"Ok now I have had this game twice now first time the game was played till it actually finally died so I repurchased it once more the story gives a small throw back to the story in the Album Music of The Elder but it also keeps time to the Comic premiss, if You enjoy RP games, Shooter Games or anything to do with KISS then I highly recommend getting this game."
1,It might be good..if I could open it!,"I don't usually offer reviews but this game is frustrating me.I finally got it loaded, set my keyboard to my favorite keys and was ready to go! Well...I ""went"" a couple of times. Once I quit the game and then went back, it wouldn't load! I'm going to uninstall it and reinstall, just to give it one more chance.The main problem is, I just finished Clive Barkers' Undying and American McGee's Alice. These two games are excellent! I was sad when I finished. In fact...I still go back to Alice. No game can compare to the eerie, unsettling, enchantment that it offers.The bottom line is that KISS Psycho Circus is not impressing me at all. In the future I will stick with EA Games. Perhaps, if I get it to work, I will come back with a better review. But it still won't hold a candle to Undying or Alice."
5,Suggestion for playing,"this is the game that got me into first person shooters. I think all Kiss fans will Like it, as well. In playing this game, I have found that It's easier to see the monitor, to see where you are, and what your doing, if you turn off all the lights around your computer, with the exception of leaving one light on, so you can see the keyboard; however, it's easier not to have any refelction on the screen when playing. I would suggest turning on a light somewhere close enough to your PC, so that you can fully enjoy this game. That's it for now."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"Its the worst game i have ever played, flame me if you must, but i just think this game is terrible"
3,Fun Shooter,"KPC was ultimately a let-down after the hype it received during development. But what you do get is a straight-forward, fun, action shooter in a dark, carnival-gone-bad world that throws hordes of enemies your way on-screen at once.The last level is unimaginative and poor, but the rest of the game is genuinely entertaining for the most part. Many of the people who criticize the game haven't even played it, they just follow the ""I'm a PC gamer"" lemming mentality so prevalent on the internet, and only play whatever is cool or most popular."
3,"Its fun for a while, a short while","Run, jump, shoot, run, jump, shoot, run ju-Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. I actually fell asleep playing this game, its so repetitive. I was looking for a really good blow-em-up time when I bought this game but the weapons are really lame and the same thing happens over and over again. It was fun for about an hour then things got real boring real fast."
3,it has its moments.,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
2,A lot of fun...when it works,"To start off, I would say that I would have liked to give this game at least four stars. Imaginative setting, more monsters than you can shake a stick at, frantic pace, and KISS (sorta). However, it's so full of bugs that it becomes unplayable after a while. Even with the latest patch it crashed a lot. And yes, I made sure all my hardware drivers were up-to-date. The worst problem was the corrupted save files. I'd click to load a saved game, and my entire system would lock up. The game's official discussion forum, which appears to be gone now, was full of people saying how buggy this game is. Probably worth a try as a bargain-bin title. If it works on your machine, you'll have a blast."
1,THIS GAME STINKS And ...!,I have played some bad games in my life....but i have never played one this bad! who thought of this lame game anyway? kiss is one heck of a band....but the game...!
5,"Stunning graphics, great gameplay, cool plot, but I'm no fan","KISS Psycho Circus The Nightmare Child is a great game. It has amazing graphics, a good plot, the smooth gameplay and engine, but I'm not fan of KISS! I never liked KISS and never really will..but this game is soo cool that you don't need to like KISS to get interested in this game! I love this game but I still don't like KISS. I'm not saying they're bad, but they don't amuse me. On the other hand, this game absolutely does! Order it today and enjoy a fast paced, rock n' roll, thrill ride of the YEAR 2K! -Carlos Jr. aka JC Denton"
3,Not A Bad Way to See Dublin,"It's a pretty good book with accurate maps, but not the best I've seen. ""25 Great Walking Tours of Dublin"" would be a more accurate title.The overviews are well-organized with helpful details about distance, time, connecting walks, and food/beverage options. Aside from the overviews, it's written in paragraph form where some stops have a full paragraph dedicated to them while others have two or three stops in one paragraph. This can be difficult to follow while walking. This was especially a challenge when taking the DART South (train) tour.All the major historical spots are covered. However, it's good to check the index to see if more info on your stop isn't also included in another part of the book.Some of the stops are a bit weak with large gaps between them and truly ""secret"" tidbits are a bit scarce. I found it useful to also carry a seperate Dublin tourbook to suppliment the major stops."
2,Not as Good as the First Two,"The third in the Little Lit series and not nearly as good as the previous two. While the earlier books had each had at least one contribution that would justify the purchase of the book for just about any audience -- from kids reading to themselves, to parents reading to kids, or to avid comic fans of just about any genre or age, this volume is _just_ silly and will probably satisfy none of these audiences. Don't be fooled by the star billing either. Lemony Snicket's contribution is good, but certainly not up to the standards of the Unfortunate Events series. Neil Gaiman's contribution is no Coraline. If you haven't purchased the other two volumes yet, start with either of those instead. If you have them, you may want to skim this one in the bookstore, and leave it there."
3,Missing important dyslexic aspects,"Although this book gives great insites into dyslexia, it doesn't address many struggles dyslexics face that have nothing to do with phonics. I have so many unanswered questions. The book basically says dyslexia is just a phonetic problem. Then why is it so hard for dyslexics to learn to read music notes? Why do they see letters and words in reverse order sometimes? Why is organization such a struggle? Why do they have such a hard time with left and right? I think the author has focused in on the main problem dyslexics face but has neglected many other issues. This book has left me wanting more answers."
5,Helps understand your child,This book helps one understand what your child is dealing with. It is helpful to understand the problem to know how you can help your child. Gives great insight.
2,"Pay for ""NEW"" and they Ship a ""Used"" Book.","I think it's a poor company that charges for a new book and ships a used book with underlines. Customer service is not their strong suite. Guess ""Buyer Be-Ware"" applies."
1,Read Gift of Dyslexia,"My friend, who's dyslexic, learned to sound out words in grade school, but she had never read a book until the age of 38, after finding the book, ""The Gift Of Dyslexia"". The way her brain works may have been described well in the book, ""Overcoming Dyslexia"", but Ron Davis' book is much more helpful overall. Also, the book ""Right-brained Children in a Left-Brained World"" by Jeffrey Freed was helpful and sometimes contradicts what Dr. Shaywitz suggests in her book."
4,Understanding Dyslexia,"This is a great book for those wanting to learn more about Dyslexia and how to help those you are teaching. I'm including teachers, tutors, assistants and parents as being teachers of those affected by Dyslexia. If there was one book you would want to read on the subject, pick this one book for better understanding of both problems and solutions."
5,A must for teaching and being a parent of a dyslexic child,"Very informative, easy to read, and a great guide for teachers and parents. Excellent suggestions on how to be the best advocate for your child."
3,Interesting read,"This is an interesting read. It is quick and easy to understand. However, it is very biased in the fact that it is only one persepctive. I think it has a lot of valuable information, but I would caution people as using this as the be-all to end-all. Shaywitz comes off as if she knows absolutely everything there is to know. Like I said, just take all the information with a grain of salt. It's a very good starting point for someone who doesn't know much about dyslexia and wants to learn more about it."
2,Shockingly Unscientific,"Shaywitz is fine when she sticks to her knitting. She knows lots about the science of the brain, and people wrestling with dyslexia or who have children doing so will benefit greatly.But when she gets to prescription, this book is shockingly unscientific. She just doesn't know the research.She praises programs like Open Court and SRA which are proven failures. She extols assessments like DIBELS that have little or no validity. She praises NCLB (which is simply a record of ten years of failure in improving education, according to the National Research Council.) There are clear records of failure in the phonics-based programs she extols, fails to cite the research, and insists that there are no other approaches that work.I think she means well. From a scientist at Yale, that's simply not sufficient."
5,A Must Read!,"This is a must read for not only spec. ed teachers but regular ed. teachers as well. Dr. Shaywitz is a dedicated individual that has really hit the nail on the head with reading instruction....no guess work here, scientifically based reading instruction for true success!"
5,"""Overcoming Dyslexia"" a Key Resource for Parents and Teachers","""Overcoming Dyslexia"" is a must have for parents and teachers working with struggling readers. It gave me insight into the science of the brain and how reading occurs for typical students and those who have difficulty decoding print. It provides overviews of reading programs that are successful and proven to work with students who have reading disabilities. I found the accelerated fluency chart to be a useful tool in helping to set a goal for my daughter and will be sure that frequent data is collected and graphed to show everyone how she is progressing. I read the book on my phone but made sure I bought my daughter's teacher a hard copy as it is a resource that she can go back to again and again."
4,Overcoming dyslexia requires a structured program...,"...because, as the author asserts, dyslexia does not remit spontaneously. That is, once you have it, it is yours, more or less, for life.This assertion holds true only if dyslexic children do not receive a structured reading-phonics program, such as the one offered by Kumon centers across North America. (BTW, Kumon instructors never refer to ""learning disability"" or ""dyslexia,"" but instead, to ""struggling readers."") This program is one of daily practice for about 20 minutes, and has embedded the three components of successful anti-dyslexia programs: practice, sight vocabulary, and phonics/phonemic awareness.Curiously, Dr. Shaywitz mentions U. of Oregon DIEBELS programs, but is not acquainted with Kumon, which has an equally broad reach across the country."
2,Stinky,Sandalwood is my number favorite scent. I found this soap stinky. I don't remember why since the wrapper and the soap are long gone. There was something else in there. Stick to the original scent.
5,Best Airpots,"I have to give a Zojirushi airpot five stars. Zojirushi is known for their airpots. They are the best. Period. My mom had one, not the premier model, just the regular one, for almost fifteen years. I just bought this one with the special pump. I have to say that I expected it to look cheaper than the one my mom had, but I was wrong. I've noticed that after over fifteen years, they still make their products the way they used to. What surprised me the most is that they are still made in Japan. Zojirushi airpots are pricey but they are worth every penny you spend. They last longer than other airpots and keep the water hot for more hours.Update: I forgot to say that it's better to fill it all the way up or at least half of it because if you pour inside only a cup of water or coffee, it will be warm the next day, not hot."
4,AIRPOT OKAY,"The airpot works great if you are making a lot of coffee. I wanted to keep four cups hot for the day. When I get home from work, the coffee is warm, but not as hot as I would like. However, a 12 cup pot of coffee keeps hot all day long."
5,Great -- use it all day every day!,I'm very happy with this purchase. I was surprised at how fast it arrived. I use it all day every day -- it keeps my coffee hot and fresh tasting all day! LOVE it and HIGHLY RECOMMEND! FAST SHIPPING!
5,Excellent coffee carafe that arrived unbroken!,"We have used Zojirushi products before; in fact the same Zojirushi coffee carafe for the last 10 years! It was still working very well, keeping the coffee hot for hours, but the outside finish was showing signs of wear. The problem was that when we had previously tried to order a new carafe from the local BB store, the carafe arrived with the internal glass vacuum shattered. That happened three times before we gave up.This Christmas my husband wistfully asked Santa for a new coffee carafe, not expecting to get the brand he wanted.But, lo and behold, Amazon came through and we got our new, wonderfully effective (both in insulating the temperature of the coffee and in the pumping mechanism) Zojirushi coffee carafe UNBROKEN!This Santa thanks Amazon very much."
5,Perfect,I bought this to keep cider hot for a fall birthday celebration. It was perfect. Kept cider hot all day!
2,Not great,"Way over rated. Doesn't keep fluids any where near to hot (or warm,relative term). Thank god for microwaves ! Hope this helps."
5,HOT HOT HOT ! ! !,"This Zojirushi Premier Airpot is all that you can ask for plus some. One morning I filled this airpot with fresh coffee at home and drove out to my construction job site. A few minutes after arriving I received an ""URGENT"" phone call from my project manager who directed me to get over to another jobsite ASAP. I forgot to take the airpot when I left the first jobsite, and did not make it back until the following morning. Upon arriving the next morning I thought that I would have to throw out the previous days' coffee and go find somewhere for a refill, but imagine my pleasant surprise to find out that the coffee in the airpot was still steaming hot. AND, it did not have that ""muddy"" taste that old coffee gets. I'm 100% sold on this Zojirushi Premium Airpot."
2,"Fragile, Difficult to Clean, Leaks","I purchased this product for my husband to take to work and drink his green tea hot. The lid doesn't come off, just flips up, so it's difficult to clean. The glass liner makes it fragile and he worries about transporting it over the long term. The biggest frustration is the leaking. The air pot need to remain upright at all times or hot liquid spews out everywhere. There is no seal or anything preventing the liquid from leaking. It's not a defect, but a design flaw that was overlooked for those who transport this item. If you plan on keeping the item on the counter all the time and using only hot water, then this may be the product for you. Conversely, if you plan on taking it to work or on a picnic, or needing to clean it on a regular basis, then get a screw top, durable ""thermos"" instead."
5,Excellent writer,"Nick Jans is an extremely gifted writer. I first read one of his essays in the Reader's Digest, and I was so impressed, I just had to read the rest of the book. His straightforward clarity, use of metaphor and intriguing observations make the Alaskan wilderness come to life. I personally would never want to live in Alaska, but I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing a bit of Alaska by reading this book."
2,A bit of a dissapointment.,"Nick Jans has done what I did not think he could (would) do - dissapoint. Much of ""A Place Beyond"" is actually ""Last Light Breaking"". I was truly let down when I turned to a new chapter, only to discover that it wasn't new! I must say that his writing is superb - vivid, usually modest, captivating. If, however, I wanted a second helping of ""Last Light Breaking"", I could have simply grabbed my old copy. No matter how good his writing is, if he can't find the time to write enough essays for a new book, then why publish one?!"
1,Like Most Sequels........,"My extremely low ranking is not for this book as a stand alone, its in comparison to his first, 'Last Light Breaking', which was a masterpiece. I would equate these two books with Tarantinos two films, 'Pulp Fiction' & 'Jackie Brown', the first also being a masterpiece, but the second leaving you wanting. Not that 'Jackie Brown' or 'A Place Beyond' are wastes of time, its just that compared to what came before, and the fact that they are basically the same subject matter, you expect that level of art and when you dont get it youre dissapointed as I was with this book.If youve already read 'Last Light', and still want a good book on the ""Alaska Experience"", im reading his latest now and let you know how it is when I finish.But if you havent read 'Last Light Breaking' and are looking for a book in this genre, waste no time in buying it, its truly an amazing book. ..."
1,This product is not meant for timelapses,"Whenever I take cross country road trips, I set up my camera on a tripod in the passenger seat and have the remote shutter handy to take shots every few seconds to create a timelapse. Unfortunately, this device cannot withstand the repeated clicking and gets jammed after a few thousand presses. I've bought two of these and they've both jammed up. This is understandable because of its cheap plastic construction."
4,Not a reference guide,"This book is REALLY for coursework : someone who is going to sit down and read and work thru this book sequentially, not randomly like a reference book.Other than that caveat it does what it promises ably but be aware that it is MATHS heavy and REQUIRES the programme work."
5,Phenomenol!,"I love this cd! It is the best! Its for anybody who likes or loves upbeat, danceable, pop-style music, would love this cd! I would recommend it to anybody hands down!"
2,Why do they taunt us?!,"We schmoes who bought Epson 1280 printers before archival inks became all the rage might have thought the good name of Pantone had come to save us. But we were wrong! What good is archival weirdness? Every now and then I am able to make a decent print with these inks, but by and large it is not possible. Almost everything comes out too green. In order to make an acceptable print I have to impart a hideous magenta cast to it on my monitor, but even that doesn't guarantee success. If a tech fix is available I would love to know about it."
1,Complete waste of money...,"These inks are a complete waste of time and money. The print quality is hideous. If you care at all about color reproduction, do not buy this ink set! Even with Pantone's custom color profiles, it didn't help. Colors were way off, terrible magenta and green casts, and the prints looked badly faded right out of the printer. After 10 or so prints, I couldn't take it; there were no combination of settings that would give me an even reasonable quality print. That was the first time I ever took out a cartridge that wasn't completely empty; also the first time I didn't buy an Epson branded cartridge. I guess I'll never do that again. Do yourself a favor and skip this terrible ink AND Pantone's don't care support attitude."
1,Pasco drain key,"the pasco drain key didn't work for me. after working for some time, I cut the drain with my jig saw. light tapping on the cuts did begin to unscrew the drain. Thinking that the drain key might make things go faster I appempted to use it again. Again, no joy. Easily finished the job with a hammer & screw driver. Drain key was a waste of money."
2,"Did not work for me on 1 1/4"" drain","I purchased this product since the cross hairs in my 31yr old tub drain were damaged prior. I tried several of times getting this sucker as tight as it could go to find out it will just turn inside the drain and not grip and turn the drain itself. I see some others have talked about its aluminum makeup vs brass drains and the grips on the tool getting eaten up. That happened to me as well. Not to mention that the tool does not grip much of the drain when using the smaller, stepped down size of Mr. 1 1/4"" If you think about it too and how it actually operates by opening on an angle then just the lowest part of the grips are going to grab the drain. It would be more effective I think if it opened evenly/uniformly and the entire grip head grabbed."
1,"won't work on 1 1/4"" drain","the manufacturer claims that this drain key will work on both 1 1/2 and 1 1/4 inch drains. however, the tool has a stepdown (the smaller part at the end of the aluminum spreading part) that is supposed to be used for 1 1/4 inch, but it does not have anything to grip the inside of the drain like the part for 1 1/2 inch does. basically, it will just spin inside the drain. you can't get it tight enough to work. there are better options for removing a drain than this. if you are patient and have some confidence, just use a chisel and hammer."
1,It did not work for me,"I bought this ""tool"" to remove an old tub drain. After tried many different ways, I gave up. It simply could not grab on to the metal inner surface of the drain head.The tool designer might have a good idea, but failed in reducing it to a practical tool."
2,Great idea - bad execution,"This is a great idea that doesn't work. No matter how tight I tighten, it still will not grip the old drain. It may work better if the inserts had larger, sharper groves to grip better. But for now... You are better paying a plumber to remove the bad drain."
3,It worked just fine but it can be dangerous.,"This worked for me. The extractor grabbed my drain without any trouble. The drain was a little roughed up from corrosion so perhaps that helped. I didn't have an adjustable wrench that was big enough to get around the nut on the extractor. I had a pipe wrench that worked though. You'll need a wrench that opens up to at least 1.25 inches.The only problem I had was trying to remove this from the drain. After exerting so much force to get it to open the drain, it is a nightmare to reverse the process. It literally took 2 people and one of us fractured a finger after it suddenly popped open and a wrench smacked into her hand."
1,absolutely useless,"ok, I had a tub which is 10 year old and I wanted to replace the drain. Due to use of cleaning liquid over the years, the cross bar was weak thus broken and for many months, I tried to find suitable tool to remove the drain. Well for one thing, there are not too many tools available to remove the drain, if cross bar is broken. I finally decided to give this key a shot and I order over the Christmas holidays. I was excited to have it, but I tell you the truth, after visually inspecting it, I doubted that it will do its job and my fears came out to be true as key failed to remove the drain from the tub. Of course the drain is jammed there, but that is whole point of using tool. this tool is inherently badly constructed tool. The coarse surface is almost a plain surface thus it continues to slip not matter how much you tighten it. the coarse surface should have had the teeth so that it could sink into the surface.Don't waste money on it."
1,Useless,"Purchased this to remove an old brass drain from my tub. The drain key would not grip or turn the drain at all. I feel like the key was not able to sit down in the drain well enough to form a solid grip because of the crosshairs at the bottom of the drain. The rings would expand to a point, then spill out over the top of the drain. I ended up using a hammer and chisel to loosen the drain flange, then was able to twist it off with a pair of long-nose pliars. Wish I would have read these reviews before wasting my money on this device."
1,"Bought it, Now I have to Replace all Tub plumbing.","I bought the Drain key after trying to replace the drain. It sounded easy. Place key into tub and keep turning until nut stops. The nut never did stop but the PVC under the tub broke first. Now i am cutting drywall, and plywood out, and replaceing the PVC piping underneath the tub. Thanks Drain Key. I am getting a new tub drain, and piping, and drywall, and plywood all thanks to your tool."
4,"What a surprise, it worked!","I took a gamble ordering this product based on some of these reviews. Even when delivered, after looking at it, I thought it wouldn't work. HOWEVER, it worked like a champ! Just make sure the drain key is screwed on tight (no spinning), you use a long wrench for leverage, and initially tap the wrench with a hammer to loosen. Good Luck!"
3,Feels ok with this purchase.,The product that they sell is just fine but as they mentioned its not wifi supported and they wont give you a set of earphones. Other than that the product is fine up to now.
4,Archos 604 wifi,"Once through the learning pains, the unit proves its worth. The wifi is the most singularly important feature to me, since I can play downloaded movies and songs from my computer's hard drive without transferring them to the archos. You will need the DVR adapter and the two codecs that Archos sells to make it work. I think it's a ripoff for Archos to sell these piecemill since you need them to make the unit work, but they never ask me for advice anyway. Don't forget, that there's a secretly hidden reset switch under the battery. They must have thought hard and long before deciding where to hide that little gem."
2,Don't buy for Steaming A/V From Internet - Overpriced Underpowered,"I bought this gizmo to watch and listen to streaming audio video direct from the internet. I listen/watch a large number of programs on internet radio stations, international TV news and from the US network TV websites. The PR says that you can listen to all formats and cannect up to the web with OPERA. They do not tell you that OPERA on Archos can not do the simple function of streaming.What kind of WIFI Media Player can not direct stream from the web? Archos! Even Palm can stream and it is not a Media Player.You are going to spend over $500 before you are done and tech support is either nonexistant or not helpful.Save you money an double check that it can do what you want it to do before buying"
1,Archos 604 Wifi Crashes,"HD crashed after just couple of months of light using. Now I cannot switch it on. Ive tried anything, including factory resetting, nothing works.Customer support experience is horrible. Send them an email three weeks ago, havent come back to me yet (despite a 48 promise of doing it). Chased them again, lets see if this time they respondI think its too great idea for such an amateur company"
4,Another Awesome hit from Archos...,"I've long been an Archos fan. I have the 6GB Jukebox Recorder, AV420and now planning on getting this. Its got a bevy of features and is an all around superb tool. I mean look at the capabilities - Wifi, browsing, photo, video ( many formats including DVD !! Just copy the decrypted vobs ), musicHowever, there are a few features that should've been there which I feel would've knocked this out of the park -1. portable gaming. Yeah, its big these days2. Phone capabilities ( this just will remain a wish till Apple comes and does it and everyone will copy )3. built-in camera for camera/video recording. C'mon every tiny cell phones have that now.4. misc. PDA functions - calendar, appts, todo, notes, voice recorderAnd it should've a larger HDD. like 200GB, 30GB just doesn't cut it these days. Hopefully, the expansion slot will make up for this.But all in all, this is an excellent product and I will get one for Christmas"
3,"Great Functionality, But Not Reliable","The Archos is a great little device and, in my opinion, outperforms the Apple iTouch in functionality and value. However, Archos needs to work on the reliability of their product.I have had to send back my Archos 604 wi-fi twice. First time because the speaker went bad; Archos sent me a replacement unit. Second second time because the hard drive became corrupt and wouldn't load any more.As I stated before, the Archos is an excellent PMP, and I would recommend it others, but I would also warn of them of problems with them as well."
3,Archos Shmarcos.,"Nawww, it's ok. I thought I'd be able to stream media thru it to my tv over wireless...but it doesn't buffer. I would love it if it buffered. Ce la vie. I got the DVR attachment, which is handy. I like throwing it into the dock to charge and record. I can't be bothered with converting stuff, this seems to be the only device out there that lets you record right off the tv. No hassle. Warning: ""Digital"" television is ""copyrighted"" (or something) and can't be recorded to the Archos...(I guess dependant upon your cable provider's technology). And Archos makes you buy a plugin to watch MP4s, which is el stinko too. Overall for the ability to be able to record and go, I like my new little Archos buddy."
4,Love My Archos,I love this thing. It is an older version but I love it anyway. I'm able to download photos from my vacation from my digital camera straight to snapfish since my archos has wifi capabilities. It's great. The only thing I would want is that the batteries die so quickly. You can watch one movie and maybe half of another one and your battery is dead already. I would definitely get a new generation on my next purchase around. I would give this one to my daughter when I purchase my next one.Thanks
5,Awsome,I really enjoy mine. It is very easy to use and not having to use something like Itunes is really nice. I like the speaker and the case and headphones that come with it are nice. It is a great player all the way around.
2,"Just OK, I may return it and try the 605 wifi",I've had 604 wifi for about for about 3 weeks. Had to buy both plugins for $40 extra to watch the video content I have available. Some stuff still doesn't work since the 604 doesn't support GMC/1/4 pixel at all. It would be a pain to re-encode just to play on this gaget. The wifi browser is also crippled and not much of a plus IMO. The best use for it would be as a uTube/streaming video player but you can't because doesn't support flash. It doesn't look like Archos plans to support this model anymore since moving on to the 605 series. I may just return this and get that one. Overall the hardware is good but the software sucks.
1,Broke within the month,"I really wanted a wi-fi handheld but this only worked for a few weeks then it crapped out. Return was no problem, but make sure you put this through it's paces within that month's time or get the year warranty. It had some good potential for a mp3/mp4 player but one day it would not even power up."
5,Works as advertised,Works great for playing movies on a car trip - decent battery life too! Wifi and touchscreen are easily worth the cost.
4,Great picture... Sound could be better...,"I recently purchased the Archos 604 WIFI Media Player, it is a very nice product with a very big price tag! If you are more concerned with with viewing pictures and watching videos than the Archos is great for you. If your primary use would be for playing music like an IPOD I would look elsewhere because the sound is not equal to that of an IPOD (I also own an IPOD). The internet option is decent, it works well for things like checking e-mail, sports scores, or reading news articles. It does not work though for web sites like YOUTUBE, and it is not JAVA enabled so doing things like watching football games in real time is impossible. I would actually give this product 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option so I rounded up to 4."
1,Horrible - Do Not Order from Amazon!,"I was send a used product. Protective cover was removed, screen was damanaged and stained. Information booklet was written on. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Can't believe Amazon had the never to send me this in the first place. Do not order this from Amazon - big mistake. Order direct from Archos site or reputable vendor."
1,Very Poor Quality Of USB Hardware Connection,"The first time we opened it up, we were so frustrated it could not be recognized by any laptops with Windows XP.1. Our laptops are good ones, which can run other USB2.0 devices with NO problems2. Called technical support, he immediately told me it is a hardware problem and advised us to return to Amazon3. We purchased this 604 WiFi from Amazon with condition ""New""4. We are surprised that this one seemed NOT being tested when leaving factory5. Visiting Archos website, it has a place for RMA. This is good for consumers, but also implies that the quality problems are a LOT6. An observation of the USB connector inside 604 Wi Fi, it is a very thin connector with a lot of pins with very fine pitch. As I am a cell phone hardware designer, I can see this might be a big problem (easil broken) in the long run7 I am returning this product right away"
2,"Great Video, poor audio","Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights. The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%. Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible. I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room. I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc. Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch."
3,Doesn't Record Weekly TV,"This is a pretty good unit. I have one negative for recording TV shows. It doesn't have a weekly record feature, meaning you have to program it for each day you want to record. I hope someone can write a program that would allow weekly recordings. It is a pain to do it every week."
3,OK,"This product is quite good for what it does. The only downsides are that you have to purchase the plugin packs in order to get the full range of video codecs and that it doesnt come with an AC adaptor. You will have to buy a USB to wall outlet adapter, or you can spend an absurd amount of money for a docking station and a cable from Archos. The only other grievances I have is that it doesn't play music while your on the internet and that PDFs load way too slow. If you can get past its shortcomings it is a good product. I do not regret buying it, I just am a little disappointed in ARCHOS for not thinking that the consumer has already spent hundreds on their product and they still want more for some very basic features."
4,Love this thing,"I bought this for my girlfriend but now upset I gave it to her! It was the most user friendly player I have used. The only reason I dont give it a 5 is the slowness of Wi-Fi ( cant seem to send emails). I am technically challenged and it took me all but 1/2 an hour to figure out how to tape TV & DVD,Wi-Fi, and download anything from PC. I highly recomend it for anyone who travels often."
3,good product but ............,"good product but wont hold charge anymore after 1 year, so i can only use it in docking station, bought another new battery and had same problem"
4,Archos 604 Wifi 30GB portable multimedia,"This product is very good for the price (Non-canadian price) But you have to have some knowledge on computers and a little knowledge in multimedia setup for the DVR station. The processor is a bit slow but not so much that you can't enjoy video. One great thing about this unit over the new 605 is that the Wifi is already intalled with the accompanying software for surfing.Pros: large screen, easy interface both touch and button, good quality, metal construction lots of storage (30 gigs).Cons: a bit slow, too many plug ins and a propriatary usb cable (if you loose it your screwed unless you buy more than one or have the DVR station)Do your own research before you buy lots of resources on the net.Thanks for reading."
4,Refreshing cultural overlap of Old West and Old East,"This has been a favorite movie of mine since it was released in the 70's. It's a western for people who aren't crazy about westerns. This flick was partly responsible for the upsurge of interest in things Eastern, especially Samurai folklore, thanks to a very entertaining portrayal by Toshiro Mifune, of The Seven Samurai fame. Of course, Bronson IS Bronson, and that ain't so bad in this one. You'll also enjoy Alain Delon, a sadistic killer cowboy with a French touch. Plenty here to keep you along for the ride, including a splash of Ursula now and then. A true sleeper (in the GOOD sense!)"
4,Sol Rojo,"This is an interesting and amusing internationally co-produced Western directed loosely by Terence Young. Charles Bronson (outlaw) teams with Toshiro Mifune (samurai warrior) in search of spoils, honor and Alain Delon (gambling con man). Ursula Andress and Capucine provide the major love interests. The highlight is Maurice Jarre's lively score integrating Eastern and Western musical idioms. This is a very entertaining film and which gets its inspiration from the Italian Westerns that were beginning to disappear into the sunset at the time of this film's release."
3,"Good movie, lousy DVD","I have been wanting to get the movie on DVD. So when it was released I bought it right away. I believe it is out of print at the moment. It's a great movie. A mix of Samurai and Western movie. Charles Bronson is great as always. Too bad the quality of the DVD is very poor both sound and picture. A remastered edition is highly anticipated. But if you can find any copy left of this DVD, grab it. I don't believe any remastered will appear any time soon."
5,Great Movie,I thorougly enjoyed this movie. The combination of Toshiro Mifune and Charles Bronson was exactly what the doctor ordered.Enough humor and action to keep you watching.
1,No VHS in my collection,"I have looked in my collection, and do not have it. Check 5 times no VHS of Red SunCKA"
1,Bad DVD,I was looking forward to seeing the movie. It was not in NTSC format so it will not play in the USA. Can not be returned because it was opened. Will never do business with this person again!!!!
2,well.............,"I just recently caught tis film on television(i know, i know, not the ideal way to see a film, but the DVD market in this third world country of mine has not really opened up yet.) Anyway, I saw the film and let me tell you, only in Hollywood will you get to see the two coolest unsung heroes in cinema history have a really good time together. The music has that 70's lilt to it even though the 1860's were nothing like the 1970's(tongue-in-cheek) Fun to watch but for Bronson and Mifune fans only."
2,"Rather repetitive, rather insulting, only occasionally funny","While operating under an amusing premise. Mr. Amory fails to deliver a truly critical work and operates from a white, male, upperclass, anglophillc mentality. The work can be comic if you are lighthearted and even more so if you are light minded. Expect little constructive criticisms, and to be the target of several prejudices.."
2,This game SUCKS!!!!!,This game [...]!!!!! The graghics are good but. The gameplay is no good. The only good thing about this game is the slam dunk contest and the three point contest. If you want a basketball game get ESPN NBA 2K5. Now ESPN is so much better than this game trust me. Do NOT get this game!!!!!!!!!!!! Get ESPN NBA 2K5!!!!!
5,read this for dunk combos fresh from the kitchen,my favorite the 720 triangle gather spin analog twice r1 triangle.b/t twice circle gather L1 circle.the cradle(jordan)r1 square gather then circle.behind the back square gather L1and circle.540 triangle gather plus spin analog twice L1 triangle.alley oop with arm in rim.left on right analog plus square gather plus L1 and triangle.to do a front flip throw ball in air from far back and press L1 and circle then any dunk.
2,WOW,"I have been playing nba live for a very long time and i have to say this is by far the worse one i have eer played.This games looks like it belongs on ps1 not ps2.The only this thats any different from live 95 is the fact that they have this new pda system that is suppose to give u more features in the franchise mode but, it sucks.The developers of this game said that it would be more""madden like"" but, the frachise is exactly the same. Oh my God I just was in shock for the first 20 hours of the purchase of this complete waste of money!My advise, get espn or 2k5 instead trust me!!!!!"
1,Go with 2K5 instead,"The only good thing about this game is the slam dunk contest. ESPN NBA 2K5 is the better buy, it's like finding a piece of gold in a landfill. Trust me it's better."
2,this game is horrible,I hated this game. I have NBA Live 2003 and the graphics are twice as good in 2003. In 2005 the graphics are terrible. The slam dunk contest is pointless because the controlls are messed up because it doesn't respond quick enough. The only thing that is good on this game is the three point contest.
4,Good New Twist,"This game added some awesome features, that are now fairly common (2011). The use of the right stick as a ""trick stick"" is pretty awesome. Also the dunk contest is pretty in depth and really fun once you get a hang of it.The game has ideas of NBA street (the trick stick and dunking), but plays much more rigidly and structured. I had the game for a while and got a lot of use out of it, especially with the online play and dunk contest!"
3,great game not realistic,"you can barely hit 100 points in a real game and you can hit 200 easy realistic 1/5 game play 3/5 season\ 5/5 extra feautures 5/5. if you like dunks get this or NBA live 2006, if you like realistic game play get NBA 2k6."
2,Bogus again,Just reading the other reviewer said it all. The fast break blows becasue the players have to stop and catch the ball. That was complained about last year too. Man--this used tro be a quality title. I could buy it the day it came out without thinking about it. Now I wait and wait and try it first. Bogus.
4,"A remarkable, multilingual recording!",This is a remarkable multilingual album that will always sound fresh and relevant! Even after more than a decade of being released it still ministers to my soul!
5,Music To My Ears,"This CD has 27 tracks for a total of 72 minutes and 57 seconds. The first 26 tracks are from many different Laurel & Hardy movies. Track #27 is ""Hal Roach-MGM Present Laurel And Hardy - Part 1 & 2"" which is Hardy trying to thank the people of the United Kingdom during a visit there and Laurel keeps interrupting him. Track #27 is a little over 8 minutes long. Very funny. My favorites are: track #8 where L&H & Rosina Lawrence sing ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pine"" from their movie Way Out West, track #12 where Hardy sings ""Lazy Moon"" from Pardon Us, and track #26 where L&H & Rosina Lawrence sing ""Way Down South"" from Way Out West. Track #20 where The Avalon Boys sing ""At the Ball, That's All"" from Way Out West was good too. I loved this CD!"
3,Just OK,"I didn't really care for the first 10 minutes or so. I kept thinking this is boring. I fast forwarded to the section where he travels by container ship; that was cool. Maybe future episodes are better, but I'm not motivated to see another one."
1,Bad handles,This item showed up timely and in one pc. The handles are attached at the base of the tin box and the workmanship was terrible. The first time I grabbed the handles one broke and I was unable to fix it. There is a small flap of metal that comes out of the base and a small hole in the handle that the flap goes through. If it's not done right you are out of luck. It's a matter of time til the other handle breaks.
3,Great phone while it works.,"I loved the phone - quality, caller ID, belt clip and the overall preformance of the unit. However I bought my first one and it just went dead after about 6 months, the second unit did the same thing.If GE could improve on the longevity of the phone it would be a great product.Let's hope GE does something about all their headsets, which seem to have the same problems."
5,A Great Product Long Gone...,"I have owned two units in 10 years. Sadly, they have been long discontinued. It is a easy to use, versatile and compact little 900 MHz phone. I went 4 houses down to a neighbors and it was still in good range. Switchable (attached) headset and rotating boom mic to boot.I have a black model which made it's usage last loads longer b/c of fingerprints, etc. It has been dropped more times than I can recall and has still endored the test of time. The dual batteries are one of the best extra features on it. Back lighting for night time display of caller id and call waiting caller id. Message indicator for in-phone answering service, large keypad even on a small unit. Excellent, just excellent."
3,Gr8 Idea; Cheaply Made,"I bought 1 of these about 2-1/2 yrs ago from [a local store] & loved the concept. The 1st thing 2 go was the belt clip; due 2 its flimsiness, it just wouldn't 'hold' in the correct position. Whenever I bent over during a conversation, the clip would rock in the opposite direction & the phone would fall completely off. That was it 4 the clip; from then on, I either carried the thing or stuck it in a pocket--that worked.The next thing 2 go was the headset: the 'adjustable' portion kept coming out of its 'track' & that was that. Overall, it's a gr8 idea & very convenient 2 use. Now, if GE would just get its act 2gether & make it a bit sturdier/durable, they'd be able 2 ask 4 more... & get it, compared 2 all these other manufacturers. Lastly, incorpor8ing a modular instead of hard-wired headset would make it easier 2 replace parts (i.e., broken headset)."
3,Just Average,"We returned the phone because the quality was a little poor. We currently use Panasonic phones and they are very clear. This one had a faint ""white noise"" sound. While the noise was not real bad, my wife and I wanted a clearer phone.Even though we didn't own it for too long, we liked some of the features. My wife really liked how the phone clips on your belt upside down. That way when the wearer looks at the phone they can read it properly. It also flips up make it easier to read."
1,Not Happy,"I purchased this phone for my baby-sitter at a Target. Because it was a gift I did not give her the receipt. I misplaced the receipt and tried returning this product a week or two after she started using it. She was getting a lot of static on the line, and she would press some numbers to dial out and nothing would happen. I have not been able to return this item for exchange at Target or with GE. According to my sitter she is extremely unhappy with this phone. I paid almost """" when this phone first came out. And I get nothing back."
3,It's great while it lasts!,"I have had my phone for about 9 months and have absolutely LOVED it. The sound quality is clear and I appreciate the volume control feature. I spend a lot of time on the phone and it really frees my hands so I can do chores while talking. But...1. The belt clip is pretty useless; the phone keeps falling off. I often end up putting the phone in the large pocket of a robe or jacket.2. After only 9 months the phone has died. I think the cord wears out and there is no way to replace it.I will consider buying another one only because there is no product like it on the market (that I know of), but I will make sure and hang on to my receipt, because I will likely need to replace it before the warranty is up."
5,20 stars for this phone!,"I LOVE this phone! I work on the phone a great deal and have tried them all. This phone outperforms even the $200+ phones I have bought in the past. An extra battery pack comes with the phone, and is kept constantly recharged, so you always have a fresh battery available. The headset is a substantial one, the best I have used yet. Many of the others consist of no more than a piece that slips over your ear, but this is a solid headpiece that is extremely comfortable to wear. The best part of all is that the caller id is built into the wireless phone, so that when you are away from the base you can still see who is calling, even when you are on the phone. I highly recommend this phone."
1,VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,We had a problem with the phone. Tried to return it and was told to contact GE. Called and went through the maze of selections. NONE for cordless headsets. Tired to find speak to human selection. None. We gave up. WILL NOT BUY GE EVER
4,Witchy drum beats!,"Well, these are basically little brooms. I like the sounds they can create. The moveable bands allow for a loose, scratchy sound or a tighter, thumpier sound and all in between. There is no way you could damage a drum head with these. I've used them on frame drums, snare, bongos, pillows and most of all my practice pad which makes some interesting sounds. They are about as long as standard drum sticks and fairly thick. For some reason I thought they would be pretty small and thin. Well made and I see no reason they shouldn't last quite a while. Nice product."
2,disapointing,"I was a big fan of 04 so I was excited when this came out. I traded in 04 n got this. BIG MISTAKE. Play control really isnt that great, there is often a delay between pushing the shoot button and the actual shot which gets frustrating on rebounds, there is no create a player, you can create a team but whatever players you choose to be on your team are still on their real team so you could have the same person on both teams in a game. The few bright sides to it is 1. scoring is more challenging and therefor more realalistic and 2. is the ""free for all"" mini game they add where basically you and up to 3 friends each control a player of their choice against one goalie to see who can score the most goals. Overall this game is not worth it. Stick with 04 or check out 06."
5,Such a funny show,"Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply amazing. Tracy Morgan is so ridiculous that you can't help laughing. The writing is witty, yet off-the-wall. You can't help but love all the characters and short comings."
4,"Great Season, but seriously, why no Blu-Ray?","Another great season from the best show on TV. Not much more to say. If you're a fan, you should own this.The only thing that continues to bug me is that they are not releasing this on Blu-Ray. It's a bummer to see it in better resolution over broadcast television than on my dvd player. Oh well...hopefully they will do it soon. I need to see if Tracy Morgan's moles are getting bigger."
4,30 Rock Season 3,"All I can say is that I bought this for my wife for Christmas per her request. I don't watch the show (or much other prime time television) but she is an avid fan of it. Obviously, she thinks it's a great series and has each of the other seasons. Personally, I don't believe there is much worth watching on prime time any more unless you care to see something about sex, adultery, modest porn (?), idiot men who cannot rise above stupid and things of the like. I guess that if that's what you're looking for in the laugh category, this would fit in with all the rest of television, so enjoy yourself!"
3,Neat Show,I had never watched this show before but after viewing this episode I must say it's a cute show
3,Jewel Jet spits hot water,"I bought my Jewel Jet directly from the maker and was happy with it for a brief time. It began to ""spit"" burning hot water even when no water had been added, so it eleminates the theory that the unit was too full. Two years later, my Jewel Jet is unusable because of smoke, not steam, seeping through the button on top. There is no doubt that this is an electrical issue."
4,Works just like jewelery store ones.,"I got this as an Xmas gift for my wife. I had my doubts but it does just what you'd expect it to do. Fill with water, heat and blast. Leaves rings etc. looking bright and sparkly. This is not a substitute for real cleaning (ultrasonic etc.) it is the final polish step. The blast of steam is much greater than one would imagine. Using many short bursts, as advised, never caused any lack of pressure. Bottom line: impressed, good product."
1,Jewel Jet Drama,I just purchased the unit and followed the instructions to use it. All the steam just flows out of the top from the cap. I sent the manufacturer an email. Well see what happens next. Good luck to all new buyers.
3,Warning - Need Sonic Cleaner Too,"I got this for my ex-gilfriend, but it wasn't what she'd wanted. Apparently this device is only meant to be used after you've already washed your jewelry in one of those sonic cleaners. It gets the dirt of out of little cracks the sonic cleaner couldn't into. I think this is probably obvious to discerning women, but to any guys who just don't know, make sure to get your girl a sonic cleaner first if she doesn't already have one."
4,Cleaner,Bought if for a present and my g/f uses it about once a month and it does a good job of cleaning up our jewelery.
2,Disappointed.,"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my Mother. The funnel was missing and the tweezers were not where they should have been for a ""new"" purchase. For the price I am very disappointed."
4,works well and well worth it!,"Just a quick note to share our expirience with this item. My wife, and subsequently all of her girlfirends love this product. We have had it for over a year now and it still cleans well and is easy to use. The reason for only the 4 stars is because I feel like the should offer interchangeable heads that would allow for a more concentrated stream of steam when need versus a wider one spray when desired. Overall, great product and a good value."
2,Cheap,"We used this product no more than 30 times before it broke....first the red ready light went out, then it stopped working all together....after emailing the jewel jet company, I was told that I would have to buy a new one...NOT, I will give another company a try...other than that it cleans good..."
2,Buyer Beware...Not for Most Jewelry,"The user instructions provided with the Jewel Jet Steamer caution against steam cleaning most gemstones except rubies and diamonds. After some online research I learned that steam cleaning is not recommended for tanzanite, emerald, topaz, etc. You can read more about this at http://www.andrewberry.co.uk/gemstones_care_of.htm. Although the Jewel Jet cleans most diamond and ruby jewelry, you will need use the ""soapy water and soft brush"" method for everything else. If I had known that steam cleaning was so limited, I would not have purchased the unit. That's probably why there is no warning about steam cleaning jewelry in the product write-up. I should have done my research before ordering."
5,good work,hey dj lil jay your cd was off da hook you did a good job with you cd and it sounds like you been through some exciting things it also seem like you had a lot of fun doing it too good luck
1,Very Poor Publication,"This 'reference' is a huge dissapointment. All you get is a bunch of pictures that don't even look like the fish denoted. This can be very confusing for anyone without alot of previous fish knowledge. Aside from the 'pictures', there is nothing to this book. A sentence or two vaugely attempting to describe the organism's natural habitat (ex: fast-flowing streams in southeast asia). No numbers or values on any of the important fascets of Aquariology besides length of the fishes (and even this is incorrect in some areas). This book wouldn't be a complete failure if it contained quality photographs, but it dosen't even come close. It is very ironic that this book is titled 'Eyewitness Handbooks: Aquarium Fish' when it can't even depict the animals correctly. What a waste of money."
2,Not what I thought,"This is a good book to highlight basic steps to setting up an aquarium but lacks detail needed for a beginner to understand. Nice book for the price, but I would not recommend it as the only book to buy when setting up your first aquarium. The book has nice pictures but just is lacking in substance."
2,Needs a companion book,"While this is a good quick reference guide, I have found that I have needed another book for most things. This would probably be good for kids as long as parents have another source for more detailed reference."
3,A good book for fishkeepers with previous knowledge,"Not enough in formation on setting up your tank or disease and breeding. Definitely not a book for beginning fishkeepers. A good book to give you ideas about your tank. To keep fish, you need another information source other than this book."
