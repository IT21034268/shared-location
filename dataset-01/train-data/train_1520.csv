1,Need more informative product description!,"The concept of this product is great. However, I would like to have been informed ahead of time that this was a #7 plastic. So...for anyone who might be interested in avoiding Bisphenol-A...THIS PRODUCT IS #7 PLASTIC!"
5,Wow...What a great CD!,"This album is far from the Men W/O Hats norm. Yes, no synth pop sound hear. It's replaced by some good old fashioned Rock 'N Roll! Don't get me wrong. I love the early Men W/O Hats stuff, but this album was a pleaseant surprise and really a natural progression. The lyrics are as good as ever and the melodies are great! Contains an AWESOME cover of ""I Am The Walrus"".Don't pass this one up!!!!"
1,Men Without Hats with guitars?,"Yuck! If I'm buying Men Without Hats, I expect lots of synthesizer sounds NOT guitars! The guitar playing on this album was boring and simple. Gone was the synthesizer sounds of the 80's. Men without Hats should have stuck with what they do best and forget about trying to play guitars."
1,Selling out???,"Question: why was it that when 70's rock bands turned to synths in the 80's to sell records it was considered ""selling out"", but when 80's bands turn to guitars to sell records today, they are considered ""smart"", doing what they can to prolong their careers? Isn't it the same thing?MWH sold their loyal fans out with this garbage. This is a far cry from classic MWH of the early & mid 80's. Every album by MWH gets worse & worse."
3,"A harder read for states with basic, intermediate, and paramedic levels.","If you ever had a question this book definitely answered it. The problem was that the scope that this book encompasses was so wide that in some states you can't do what the book says you can do. I used the workbook more than i ever used the actual book. I feel the workbook focuses on all the important things where the book tries to encompass everything. I live in texas where there is a paramedic level and this book makes it hard to differentiate between what is done by paramedics in texas and intermediates, since intermediates do paramedic work in other states. Of course, if you work in the field you would know you're guided by protocols, but as a student it's harder to grasp."
3,Damaged Package,Well for one Im still a lil upset that i paid 116.20(Textbook and workbook) and the textbook wasnt even a hardback! What the hell! This next thing is probably UPS's fault but the box my order came in was crushed to all hell one one side. The books were ok for the most part but I wasnt to please when i opend my door and saw that beat up box.Im ok with the workbook being a paperback but I think for the price the textbook should be a hardback.
1,An Intermediate's Opinion,"Over 10 years ago I received my EMT-I training using Caroline's Emergency Care in the Streets, 4th edition as a text book. I still have it! Recently the director of the ambulance service I am employed with asked me to write up test questions for new I's on pratices and proceedures. I was introduced to Bedsoe's Intermediate Care text book, thought so highly of it that I purchased it and I now regard it as highly as Caroline's Paramedic text book. I refer to it often and it has been a great aid in getting up to date as well as helping me write up the questions for testing new I's."
3,Feliciano...fast forward,"I'm a huge fan of this talented musician, enjoying both his vocal and instrumental renditions. I must say that I expected more from this CD than it delivered. As I moved through the tracks, I kept expecting to hit on a ""Light My Fire"" or an instrumental equivalent of ""Yesterday."" The music is ""listenable"" but not inspiring. I still hope this venerable musician has one or two more uplifting CDs left in him!"
5,The Best Diet-Fitness Book out there!,"This book is the Health Bible for those who wish to lose weight and keep it off. And for those who wish to stimulate their own's bodies' production of the all important Human Growth Hormone by combining exercise and the proper nutrition. One of the most important books I've ever read. Mr. Faigin's research is thorough and the book is well footnoted with the medical references he sites. The downfall of the human diet is historically mapped, starting with the change to grains during the Agricultural Revolution. Degenerative diseases began to afflict mankind at that point, then the diseases made further quantum inroads with the invention of processed foods. This book is a must read. It gets a bit technical with the explanations of the endocrine system and so forth, but this is knowledge that we all should be aware of."
4,good data.,Great research and good data. Make sure you have a dictionary at hand when reading it. It is very technical. I will say that the actual diet is really simple to understand though.
1,Maximum Contradictions,are abundant in this book. If the whole goal is to work the ATP/CP and Glycolytic system (glucose as source of energy) then why would you refrain from ingesting carbohydrates. He suggests you never get info from a fitness magazine yet one of his sources is from Muscle and Fitness 1997. Don't waste money on all the hype.
3,"OK, but a LITTLE too hard for ME,,,","It took me a week to finish this book. It had no pictures. My mom said it had 158 pictures, but it didn't. It had long chapters, 12 chapters. I do not recommened some nine year olds to read this book, I'm one."
5,This book stayed with me,"I've recently had the urge to go back to books that moved me as a child. Even then I was an avid reader, and this book was one of the few that I've felt compelled to buy and reread as an adult. It's a book like this one that reminds me that good writing is good writing, and an honest and emotionally real book can move me, no matter what audience it is intended for."
4,It tells the truth about relationship between family.,"This story tells the truth about relationships between people, especially such intimate people as family or friends. When I first picked up this book, I felt quite the same as Conrad about having divorced parents.It gave more and more ideas about why I don't trust people easily. Because ""lies""make life complicated. Some people say that lying can do good sometime.But in fact, it doesn't solve the problem at all. How can we tell what is genuine and what is fake if we conceal true feelings? I had fun reading this book, not only because it's easy for me to read but also it gives me much inspiration about dealing with my family life."
3,"Usefull, but.....",This book is loaded with information but I have learned not to rely on it too much. It uses a 'cookie-cutter' approach to interpretation. It's kind of like purchasing a nice computer desk from IKEA then getting it home and trying to put all the parts together. It's a good one to have in your library for reference.
2,A bit of a confidence trick,"This book I found to be written in that style that makes you think the author really knows what they are talking about but alas they only know what they believe.Its very convincing on a first read but like many guru books the ideas are like sand through the fingers.If your looking for nice arguments at the crystal ball-a must read.The books basic drive is that each house develops off the previous which I think is a very simplified view.What about oppositions, squares and trines?In the end it was stolen out of my bike carrier , may the gods protect me!"
5,Comprehensive and Impressive,"Frances Sakoian and Louis S. Acker are exceptional authors whose astrological works will live on far after they have left us. Their insights capture the subtleties, as well as, the principles of astrology, thereby, becoming excellent teaching tools. As one who was born to be an astrologer, I strongly encourage any individual who has a sincere interest in this subject matter, including professionals, to buy these books and digest them in their entirety.Robert the Astrologer"
4,a useful book,"this is a very useful book, even though nowadays there are also a lot of computer programmes available, too, which can do an equally good job (at times perhaps even out-doing this book).This book discusses the planets, their position in signs and houses, the traditional ""major"" aspects in the natal chart (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition), and other subjects (exhaltations, dispositors).The language in this book is quite clear, but descriptions at times seem too extreme, presenting the qualities described either as very negative or, conversely, extraordinarily fantastic (like, e.g., clairvoyancy). I normally use this book in connection with other books or computer programs; yet, as a whole, the book is well worth the money,"
5,The Basic Textbook,"This was the book which actually introduced me to astrology, and it remains by far the best I have seen after all these years, both in that category, as well as a general book on the topic for the whole spectrum of those acquainted with the field from beginners to scholars. It is a serious, easy to read, no-nonsense primer, which at the same time acquaints the novice with the actual philiosophy behind the subject in the form of concise delineations, and that is what is really important. More than that, it is also devoid of the mumbo-jumbo which many use to try and ""spice up"" and mystify an otherwise very real art, and which has ended up in discrediting it and making it a laughing stock. I will say no further, suggesting to the reader that it should be read directly instead to form an opinion about it, rather than reading its reviews."
4,A Must For Serious Astrologer-Surpasses Expectations !,"The book is neatly written,it explain step by step ""How to Caste your own Horoscope"", and interpret it. Further the book explain the importance of not only Sun,but moon,the houses and the importance of aspects in study of horoscope.This book is unique because it considers the horoscope not only from Sun sign,but in totality.Acker & Frances have intelligently used their previous experience as writers to explain in clear,concise way ""the systems approach"" of casting and analysis of horoscope.Book is free from any ambiguity.The book is recommended for beginners as well as advanced lovers of Western Astrology.After reading this book you will be hungry for the next book by the writers.Dr.Parihar(Vedic Medical Astrologer)"
3,calling all cars,"If you loathe todays smarmy cop shows and their condescending pretentios ways, this is the item for you! Primitive, by any stretch of the imagination, yet grittier than a sandpaper facial! A great bargain!"
1,Well worth missing,"To start with, Tars Tarkas has two arms and Dejah Thoris is a blonde. It's sort of all downhill from there.If you ignore its supposed origin, it's a fair swashbuckling adventure - as long as you can tolerate the 1950s-style masks on the Tharks, subpar acting, and ineffective effects. Fans of ERB might give this one a miss, though. I haven't read the originalPrincess of Marsrecently enough to remember the details, but I might have to, just to brighten the memories of Barsoom that this has tarnished.-- wiredweird"
1,A jar of pickles with a peaches label,"Whatever this horrid garbage is, it is NOT the story penned by ERB! Horrid acting, cheesy special effects and it bears only a very slight resemblance to the actual Princess of Mars story.It's like someone giving you a jar or pickles that has a big peaches label on it covering up the sour pickles inside.Don't waste your time or you hard earned money on this stinker."
1,Disappointing.......,"I agree with these other reviews listed here. There is a reason this ""thing"" went straight to DVD! Unfortunatley the images that kept occurring to me throughout this movie was all early movies that Traci Lord made."
3,Better than I expected...,"As a Burrough's fan I'm always in favor of a movie of his books. Just as Johnny Weismuller was not his Tarzan of the Apes the director worked with what he had. The special effects were good, the makeup needed more glue and it was not even in our solar system... but it was fun. One of these days someone will follow the book to the letter. Until then this will have to do."
2,"whisky, tango foxtrot , over","well, It did have Traci Lords in it which to be honest is why I bought the thing. next most importaint was the show itself. I came across a comic years ago about this story line and have tried to find more on it. The comic didn't have the cover so it was years befor I could put a name to it. finally found it and enjoyed the story. Then one day discovered there was a movie on it and rushed to Amazon to get it. Read the reviews and thought there just wasn't any way to ruin a good comic this thoroughly. I was wrong. warning, don't eat or drink anything before or durning this movie. Afterwards is up to your stomach.All comments to her past porn ""acting"" jobs aside, Traci has turned into a fair ""B"" movie actress and if the right scripts came her way could move forward. This however was not the right script."
1,A cheesefest of epic proportions,"What do you get when you mix a great book with sub-standard production as only Asylum can do? You get this piece o' cheese. My favorite part is early in the movie when John Carter first encounters the Tharks. The director tries to use camera angles to suggest the Tharks are much taller than John Carter but within a few shots just says ""the hell with it"" and makes them the same size. Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris is more like the ""Spinster of Mars"" as she seems too old for the role. Plus, she always has this look on her face like she's really cheesed about something (maybe the fact that she has to do Asylum movies to earn a living). The Thark masks are horrible and not even in a good way. Tars Tarkas (Matt Lasky) is also way over-dramatic in his line delivery. Watch it once just so you can say you did, then forget about it and wait for a better adaptation."
5,Love the special effects,"We loved the"" little"" dog like creature looked to us like a Pug and we have a Grandpug that we love to death.The story was great The ending was very unusual"
1,a waste of time and money (no matter how little),"This film, start to finish, is a complete waste of time. First of all, the writers take great liberties with the Burroughs' books and, in essense, do little more than use the character names for their own story, much of which has nothing to do with the ""John Carter"" series. The makeups are incredibly bad with no attempt to make the masks fit around the eye or let the actors speak without sounding gagged. Deja Thoris looks nothing like the ""vision of beauty"" described by Burroughs. And the CGI effects are extraordinarly cheap and poorly done in every scene that needs them. How some people gave this 5 and 4 stars is beyond me unless they kids with little experience with films or reading these books.Bottom line: avoid this ESPECIALLY if you're a Burroughs or John Carter fan."
1,Princess of Schtick,I cannot accept the fact that I waited over 50 years to see a film adaptation of my favorite childhood book and this came out first. Save yourself the agony and ignore this ridiculous piece of drek. It bears so little resemblance to the written story that it could be called by another title and no one would suspect that it had its origins in an ERB novel. I shouldn't even mention the acting. I'm sure they were doing their best and it would be cruel to discuss in any more detail. If this thing wasn't so pitiful I would be angry. The up side is that it will most certainly disappear quickly.
1,Edgar Rice Burroughs would roll in his grave.,"I was hoping for something more closely faithful to the book. Antonio Sabato, could probably have pulled off John Carter, but Traci Lords as the Princess of Mars? Please? The princess of mars was young, deeply tanned and petite, but voluptuous. The creatures of mars were larger and six legged. The non-human species were green, much taller and had four arms.If you like B-Class sci/fi fantasies with bad special effects, which normally I do find amusing, you might like it. Me, I am an Edgar Rice Burroughs fan and would love to see movies that followed the books in their truest form.We have the technology. James Cameron?"
3,Depends on your point of view,"I read the other critics and 1 did say the movie was ""okay"". Mostly, what I heard was that the movie did not ""go with the book"" or it was too hokey. Personally, I was impressed with what they were able to do with the budget and acting they had. Traci Lords is a fair actress and she did a job worth watching and listening to. She cannot help what the lines are. Yes, they were hokey. Our male star had the same problems. However, when I look at the movie overall and just look at a very basic outline of the plot of the book, they match up fairly well. A guy at war gets transported to ""Mars"", fights the bad guys, and wins the girl. Hey! That's the basics. Quit getting all worked up about how close it is to the book and just enjoy the ""B"" movie for what it is: ""B"". I don't feel I wasted my time. I even had to snicker a couple of times; some when I was supposed to and some where I wasn't. :-)"
2,Not the best John Carter story,"Poorly shot and poor effects, however with a 12 day shooting schedule I give everybody involved a pass. Even the actors didn't have much of a chance on such a tight schedule. Traci Lords has made better films, but she is miscast as DT. Antonio Sabato looks every bit the John Carter. For folks who love cheese this is irresistible. The Disney bomb ""John Carter"" was a much better adaptation, and should not have bombed."
1,Just plain sad,"I saw this movie after reading the classic - The Pricess of Mars by Edgar Burroughs.This movie was ridiculous. This movie was a waste of my time. I kept watching it becauseI love the book and thought I would see glimpses of the book in the movie.I, instead, banged my head against the wall to get the images of this movie out of my head.A classic such as the book - Princess of Mars - was made into this ridiculous moviewith terrible actors.I had to read the book again to get the memory of this stupid movie out of my head.I could not let this movie ruin a favorite classic book of mine."
1,Poorly made video of a bad re-invention of a classic story,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book, I had mistakenly thought that this might be a half decent adaptation or ""re-invention"" of the classic book. I knew that it had been ""updated"" from the era immediately following the American Civil War to a modern day setting; but, aside from a few of the names being kept the same and a few of the plot elements on Barsoom being mimicked -- the video bares little resemblance to the classic. The acting was B-movie at best (perhaps no rehearsals and limited or no re-takes???), the handful of special effects were apparently very low budget, the editing was rough, the reinvented plot seemed like something half a dozen drunk college kids might create as a spoof skit for a fraternity party. It's almost like a spoof being done, but they forgot to do it in a campy manner like ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" so you could know it's a spoof. Watching this video was a waste of time."
1,A BIG STEAMING PILE OF SLUDGE,"I survived this film for 20 minutes before I tossed the disc into a scrapyard. It felt good, too. This film is a big steaming pile of sludge that no Edgar Rice Burroughs fan should have to suffer through. The dialogue is off, the pacing is horribly simple and ineffective and the characters need a ton of work. I'd have more to say but that would mean I'd have to suffer through this joke of a picture. MY GRADE: F."
1,I waited over 40 years for this !?!,"In the 60's I read all of Edgar Rice Burrough's books. I always hoped someone would bring John Carter to film. This film (and I use the term film loosely) is beyond bad. This movie makes the worst Tarzan film look like Gone With The Wind in comparison.The novel's story is gone, the characters are all wrong and the tharks only have two arms and obvious rubber tusks. Save your money, save your time and wait for the big budget film version that should be out within a couple of years.I gave it one star because zero stars was not an option."
2,Princess of Mars (Sort Of),"This movie is a B minus sci-fi film. The sets were cheap. The acting is wooden. The makeup is 1970's horror film style. Traci Lords is 40ish acting as the 20 something year old Princess. She still looks great. Sabato is a cigar store Indian. The green Marians are 6 ft 6 in or less, with 2 arms & 2 legs. The story is very loosely based on the Burrough's book. The rewrite is weak, but the book is too long for a 100 min movie. This is a grade B movie without much CGI to help out. If James Cameron would direct/produce this, then we would have something. thanks Duffy O'Dell"
2,dont get your hopes up,"this film could have been so much better. they tried to condense the book too much, and shouldn't have tried to adapt the storyline to modern settings. Their special affects were pretty lame too."
2,Oh my stars!,"A bit of a novelty: written, edited, photography, AND directed by..............Mark Atkins.I love how they strategically placed this claim on the DVD cover: the classic story that inspired James Cameron's AVATAR. As if that had anything to do with this movie!Nothing could elevate this movie into the realm of art; it's simply trash for the sake of trash. It stars Traci Lords for pity sake! And what's his name, Antonio Sabato, Jr. Neither of which are first rate actors. Not that they had much to work with, the dialog is pitiful, only made worse when delivered in a serious manner.As I only paid 5 bucks for it at Target, I can't complain too much. (The clerk warned me at the checkout, ""you do know this isn't the Disney one?"") Hey, I was curious; 5 bucks didn't seem too dear to satisfy my morbid sense of curiosity.Poor Edgar Rice Burroughs, if he were alive today this would have killed him. (I do believe this is a case of assault in the first degree.)"
1,Honestly the WORST SCI-FI Film I have EVER Seen!!,"Bad story with parts and scenes and people that make no sense whatsoever. Bad script with lines that just lay there never going anywhere. Bad acting. Extremely bad visual effects. A cast of at least a dozen people, using cheap video effects that occasionally try to create the illusion of a hundred, very badly!!Altogether boring, pointless, cheap, inexpensive, and horrid!!The ONLY good thing about this movie is the shirtless Antonio Sabado Jr. (IF you're a gay male or straight female and he's your type). Otherwise, even if you can get this movie totally FREE on Netflix. Do NOT watch it. You will have wasted what seems like 3 hours of your life!Goodness it's bad. Really, very bad."
3,Forget the book,"Leave your brain at the door, have a few drinks and nibbles to hand and you might enjoy this, but Traci lords as a princess - I do not think so. However if you are a Burroughs fan steer well clear."
4,laughable,"Sabato seemed wooden, Traci lords seemed a bit too old for the role she had in her closeups, but I could accept that.But when I saw the four armed person they were talking to I cringed. He had two tusks like in the novel and didn't look too bad. Then I saw a close up of his head. Whenever he talked or moved his head you could see his two tusks sway with his head and jaw movements. It was a laughable prosthetic application You don't need to be a doctor to know that if this guy were ever hit in the face, his tusks would fall off or be useless, broken and hanging off his face. Just bumping into something would break them the way they were bouncing around. Teeth and tusks are anchored in the jaw. check your own mouth! They don't juggle around whenever you move your head! It totally ruined the believability of the film. Alien creatures need to look realistically believable. Tusks don't jiggle."
1,awful,"probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It is clear they just threw something together for about 10k so they could lure people into accidentally buying or renting it instead of the real thing (which is currently in production apparently). Really, really bad. I could do better with a couple of buddies and a flip video. Bad story, lousy acting, horrible effects. I mean, really, don't insult Burroughs' memory by spending a dime on this. Just say no."
2,done better,"meats done better. not much new on this bonnie does her job. just a good record not much new. worth a listen love bonnies voice. other wise look for other meatloaf disks,"
1,Disappointed,Ordered 02/17 - was sent the wrong item. Returned it immediately but still waiting for receipt of correct item on 03/21. Not happy.
4,Not what I expected,"I thought this was going to be a duet CD and instead it was Meatloaf and then Bonnie and then Meatloaf again. I guess it's like getting two CD's for the price of one. The only problem is that I'm such a huge Meatloaf fan that I already had all of those songs. I like Bonnie Tyler, but I wouldn't have purchased this had I known that. I thought it would be interesting to have their two voices together instead of just alternating songs between the two."
5,Great CD!,"I ordered this CD for my father, and he was very pleased with the collection of songs on this CD."
1,Steinman is everything without Meat Loaf,"I was very angry at the review saying: ""Steinman is nothing without Meat Loaf"" when, actually, it's the other way 'round.In case you don't know already, Steinman is the greatest philosopher EVER! And YES! He does have a life outside Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler, including some really great musicals:THE DREAM ENGINE - A 3 hour rock masterpiece, MORE THAN YOU DESERVE, NEVERLAND & THE CONFIDENCE MAN. This reviewee should take the time to study Steinman, like I did, instead of publishing lousy reviews about him.HEAVEN AND HELL's a dreadful compilation, and deserves to be destroyed for it's content."
4,Good replacement fitting,"I used this fitting to replace the quick disconnect style fitting on a Weber Genesis 1000 gas grill. It has the same 1/4"" NPT as the nipple that was in the regulator and it was easy to tighten with a socket wrench. My only concern is the strength of the plastic acme threaded collar. Works now on fully pressurized tanks but will it fatigue in the future?"
1,Stupid Music,"All chops and no soul. I bought this hoping to hear some fresh ideas by some highly touted players from Italy, what i got was a bunch of sterile technique and bad compositions. The guitarist is no doubt a dedicated guy with some serious chops but he sounds like he has ripped off Greg Howe but without the funk or feel. The tunes are reminiscent of some of Howe's earlier material as well, which is very boring, get your own ideas!!. The drummer sounds like Mike Portnoy after a case of Red Bull, scary. Dont waste your money on this."
5,Brillantly Written History of Southern Sudan,"Deborah, an credialble story teller one can see by reading the first page. From there on one is caught the with amazing written history of Southern Sudan from the religious aspect to the Oil dealings. She manages to combine, passion and intellect in such a way with so much emotion one does not want the book to finish. It teaches the unfamilair with what is happening with Sudan today. A much read for all."
3,Could have been better,"""Emma's War: An Aid Worker, a Warlord, Radical Islam, and the Politics of Oil--A True Story of Love and Death in Sudan"" by Deborah Scroggins has plenty of fine moments and interesting insights into the aid industry and those who work in it -- the problem is that the good parts are few and far between. This book is not focused on its supposed subject (Emma McCune, a one-time British aid worker who married a Sudanese ""warlord""), and its many excursions into other seemingly related topics somehow distract more than enlighten. A very good editor could have made this a much better book. As it is, I can only recommend it to people who are very, very interested in the aid biz or Sudan. I am sure that there are many other books on these subjects that would be more useful to the general reader."
4,Friend Of The Devil,"Deborah Scroggins gives voice to a tsunami of human suffering in the Horn of Africa while exposing the cynicism of Southern Sudan's rebel ""leadership"" and the shallow vanity of the Western aid establishment. Though there is fodder aplenty for condemnation here, Scroggins restrains herself ably (save for an occasional swipe at the usual Western conservative bogeymen).In the end, this book is a mirror from which the reader cannot escape: How many innocent Africans must starve before I will really care? If not me, who? If not now, when? And once read, Scroggins' frustrating work refuses to rest politely on the bookshelf: this is a real Tragedy, and now the reader, like it or not, has a supporting role.""Emma's War"" marks Deborah Scroggins' first bow on the literary stage since her triumphant screenplay ""Death In Decatur."" Let's hope there's much more to come from this talented writer."
3,A Lich Rubbish,"Aside from a skull faced lich, this had little to offer in horror. A castle now could be simply a house."
2,Needs More Pictures,I expected more from this book. I was decorating my new office and wanted some ideas. I didnt get a single idea from this book I liked. The final ideas I got were from watching some television shows.
1,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in this doll only because what I received is not what the doll is supposed to do. When feeding the baby, the mouth is supposed to move as if really eating and it does not."
3,"Baby Alive ---my daugther loves it, but I don't","Well, this doll is a little scary looking in person. The eyes are HUGE! but overall, I think it's okay. My daughter loves it and it does make really cute sounds and some of them are quite bizarre, like it sniffs and then says ""I made a stinky!"". The only thing that bothers me a little is that the doll is too heavy, my 8 year old daughter is quite strong so that's not a problem, but I am worried about my 2 year old daughter dropping it on her feet and hurting herself.The diapers on this doll do not stay put. It's a shame because it only comes with a couple of diapers so now the doll is naked from the bottom down. Not a pretty sight considering that there is a rather large orifice on the doll's rear end (!) that is quite visible from any angle except if she's sitting."
5,"Baby Alive, great doll!",This is a great doll and is a bit too realistic with going through the diapers!
4,great doll!,"Baby Alive lives up to it's advertising. My daughter is thrilled and loves taking care of her. What's great is if she gets tired of playing with her and wants her to take a nap for a long while, you can simply turn her off. She can also just put herself to sleep with the pacifier - way cool! What I dislike is having to go through diapers and the food could turn to mold inside the dolls body eventually, so we have opted not to use the real food and stay with water in the bottle to be safe.Otherwise she is a joy to my daughter! Great product!"
5,"Great doll, but HEAVY","My 7yr old daughter received this for Christmas and she adores it. It seems to eat and drink just fine. The face is made of a different material, and yes it does get dirty easily. The doll talks and talks and talks. Our only complaint is the doll is very heavy. My daughter, who doesn't want to put the doll down, complains how sore her arm is!"
3,Face paint comes off!,"This doll is great for playing mommy, but the lips come off very easily. My daughter got so upset I had to go and buy some paint to paint the lips back on. I feel that the face should have better paint used especially around the mouth where clean-up needs to be done frequently when you are ""feeding"" the doll."
2,Makes OBNOXIOUS sounds,"This is all my 6 year old daugher wanted from Santa, and it has overall turned out to be a disappointment for everyone. First of all, she makes these totally annoying loud clicking sounds with her eyes and they get stuck all of the time. We have changed the batteries twice and checked the switch, but she still does it. This is right after she got opened on Christmas morning by the way. The food and diaper thing is cute, but like others have said, it is very messy and it seems to take 2 diapers to make sure that all of the food is ""passed"" so she won't sit there in a dirty diaper. Her face is already totally filthy b/c it is a sticky rubber and the paint has already wiped off in places. Keep in mind I am writing this less than 36 hours after she was opened. Just maybe consider another doll when coming up with gift ideas for any occassion."
3,Read the reviews,"Was ""luckily"" able to score one of these for my granddaughter as it was #1 on her Christmas list...my daughter is hating life...the doll is a huge mess to maneuver for even a 5-year-old and has food sticking to its hair, clothes, and anything it touches....if the doll ends up face down, the doll has another trick -- vomiting!! If the diaper isn't on securely, then you get the poopy all over whatever it's laying on...and after 3 hours of wiping food off of its mouth, the lips are already about gone; really, couldn't the color be molded in?? Kind of cute and my granddaughter loves her, but it is amazing to me that this doll has survived this many years in existence....it's a bit of a mess..."
3,If I wanted another child I would have had one...lol...,"My daughter loves this doll, Santa came through for her. I, however, was not prepared for another child. I had to stop what I was doing yesterday to clean up an exploded poop! My child brings her to me and says...""Mommy she needs a diaper"". If I say you do it, she says ewwwww, yucky. Now I have to go out for diapers! Also, I have to wash her (Baby Alive's) clothes now too. Very messy. The kid loooooves it, but Mom's beware---its a lot of work for us."
3,Baby Alive,"My daughter is pretty good with her toys and is old enough to not force the mouth to open or close against the motor of the doll, but the mouth on Baby Alive worked the first day when she ate, then after that, she stopped making the noise (when she is eating) and her mouth stopped working...would like to get her replaced somehow"
5,Baby Alive Doll,"A hard doll to find at my local stores. I found the doll here at [...] and purchased it for a Christmas present for my daughter, she never puts the doll down, went over well with her as a present. I also received the doll at a great price, shipping was fast on the doll, everything went well.This was my first purchase ever made through [...], I will be doing a lot more shopping on this web site.....THANKS"
3,This baby is too alive!!!!,"For the first 3 days, Baby Alive is the best toy you can get your little girl. After the first 3 days, you wish you would have gotten some other toy. Speaking from personal experience with my daughter, after the 3rd or 4th day, she didn't even want to look at the doll. When my wife and I questioned her about it, her reply was ""It's too much work"". Baby Alive only has about 4 or 5 phrases which she continuosly repeats while awake. She is always hungry which means a diaper change will soon follow. She just can't hold her food down. :)"
1,Disgusting and Creepy,"We got this doll for our four-year old. She likes it but beware...this toy creates a DISGUSTING MESS. A green gel substance comes out of her behind after feeding it the special food (you're given four packs of food and only two diapers...hmmmm...). I had to dismantle its high chair, remove clothes, scrub the tile/grout and run water down her mouth to get this stuff out completely. Needless to say, this doll will be on an all water diet from now on."
1,disaster doll,"this doll is a complete disaster. while she might be fun for kids to play with, i spend alot more time trying to clean her than my daughter does playing with her. i spend about a half hr trying to clean this doll everytime my daughter feeds it and i still cant ever seem to get all the food out. on top of that and the mess the doll makes eating the diappers for the doll are kinda exoensive for the amount of times u need to change it, its actually cheaper to buy a 30 pk of pampers preemie diappers theyre the same size as the baby alive ones and they dont leak like the ones that come with the doll. i would only recommend this doll to parents that have the time and patients to dedicate to cleaning this doll"
2,All my daughter wanted for her birthday...,"This is the only thing that my 7 year old wanted for her Birthday. After much searching, I located Baby Alive with bonus pack. She was thrilled with her baby, until she tried feeding her. She would not eat the food. I went on-line and tried everything they suggested. Nothing worked. When my daughter wiped the food off the dolls lips, the paint came off. Did I mention this was within the first hour of having the doll. When I asked my daughter how she liked the doll, she said , ""She's o.k., but she doesn't eat her food and the water from the bottle leeked all over except in her diaper."" Needless to say the ONLY thing she wanted for her birthday went back to the store and was replace with a Magical Glo Bear."
2,Baby Alive not worth how much I paid,"I purchased the baby alive for my daughter and in ONE day the lips rubbed off just from using the bottle and spoon. She had not even fed it food yet! Not only does it look 3yrs old in one day the hair on the baby alive leaves alot to be desired. The packaging smashes down the hair making it look full, but once you get the doll out it looks like it has had a hair transplant! I would not buy this doll again and have already contacted Hasboro and they are sending a replacement - but that does not fix the underlying problems with the product."
1,Broke after 1 month,"My daughter loves this doll. I only let her use water to feed her so not sure how messy she can be, but one day while doing this my daughter played with the dolls eyes and the doll started malfunctioning. So don't let your kids play with the eyes. THe doll will make loud clicking noises and not work. Not worth the money for only 1 month of play."
3,Doll's just OK,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. Its very expensive for what it does. Also you only get 3 diapers with the starter pack and you go through them fast. Also they are kind of hard to put on and its messy. Also its hard to put the spoon in the mouth, you kind of have to shove it in and let it slide off the spoon. My daughter likes it but as the parent I thing its kind of a lot of work and too much money. And it only has a few sayings!"
1,this doll is no good for the environment,"I cannot believe that all the diapers that just have some colored water on it are needlessly going to land fills. Is it only about how cheap diapers can be bought. I think the doll is over all great and there should be reusable and washable cloth diaper available with the doll. I understand that it is in toy company's interest to have diapers and food for the dolls, but we must think about the future of our kids and make the doll a little eco freindly."
2,Not so great and clicks clicks clicks!!!,"The doll is weird. First off, it is HEAVY. My daughter is 5 so this isn't that much of an issue but it can not fit into any normal doll beds, strollers etc... Her head is HUGE and rubbery so it isn't easy to clean. She is a total mess and honestly she is going back. My daughter loved it the day of christmas but after 3 packets of food and 3 diaper changes, she is bored with it. I knew that would be the case but bought it anyway. She only says a few phrases and once you press her bracelet, you hear a dull buzzing sound for about 3-4 seconds and then her eyes click click click and then she laughs. Everytime her eyes close, it clicks. It is very annoying and not lovable at all. I think the Fisher Price talking toddler doll is much more doll like and a cute normal voice to boot. After 2 days of not touching this toy, I am returning it before it gathers dust and molds on the inside."
2,"Cute, but not worth the money","Five minutes out of her package, Baby Alive had a tear in her mouth. Is it a defect or just over-eager spooning? Either way it's unacceptable for a $40 toy. Also right out of the box, her face was filthy. Her ""skin"", while life-like, is strangely sticky and attracts everything from dirt to fuzzies. She comes wearing one diaper and has a spare, but after that she's pantless, which is a bit jarring because of the large hole in her bottom. On the other hand, my 3-year-old daughter loves hearing her talk and pretending to feed her. The facial animation is very cute, and she does say a variety of things. Overall I'm happy because my daughter is happy, but I'm quite disappointed in the quality of this doll."
4,A little girls favorite Baby,I actually bought two dolls for 2 of my granddaughters. They were so excited to play with them. They do need supervision if they are under 10. I am the special grammie who buys the things that they really really want. So.....I did very good with the Baby Alive.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"My daughter begged for this doll for her birthday. First, let me say that she DOES love this doll. I am not so enamored. She has had it for two days. We fed it for the first time today (just used the empty bottle up til now), and the paint came off the lips, as described in another review. Also, it makes these odd whirring noises, which I am not sure are normal, or just a problem with our doll. Also, you really have to clean it out well after feeding - the food does not go through easily. We did get an extra pack of diapers."
4,Don't buy the Baby Alive Diapers too expensive.. there is a better option!,My daughter received this doll for Christmas and she really enjoys it! I feel that the dipaers they sell for this doll are too expensive for what you are getting. I have priced them at 6 diapers for $5.98. My daughter actively plays with this doll and can go through a pack in 2 days. I found that Pampers preemie diapers fit her just fine and you get 31 diapers for $8.99!
5,Adorable!!!!,"Both my daughters just love this doll. We have spent hours feeding her, changing her, giving her- her bottle. Both my young daughters are able to ""feed"" doll without a problem! They are rough with doll at times and doll has proven to be very well constructed! Doll's eyes have been poked, her mouth forced open, dropped and it has kept working!"
1,horrible doll now I am stuck with,I bought doll for niece-I was so pleased i found and p ut away for Christmas after Thanksgiving went to wrap it and realized that the doll sounded possessed and defective-but over thirty days so I was stuck with it went to a local retailer and bought another-very disappoited that I was stuck with a defective toy
3,Baby Alive Doll,"My daughter received the Baby Alive doll for Christmas and enjoyed playing with, however, the doll made such a mess when it poops. The food that comes out stained all of our towels. Bleach did not even remove the stains. Kids do enjoy this doll, but get ready to replace your towels or use old ones."
3,SOLO TIENE EL IDIOMA EN INGLES,"SOLO TIENE EL IDIOMA EN INGLES, CUMPLE SU FUNCION DE MUÑECA PERO NO ES NADA EDUCATIVO"
4,Baby Alive,"It brought back many memories,I was pleased with it and my daughters love it.It is a little messy so if you have a very little one I would not recommed it.I would say about 5 and up.Enjoy!"
2,Fun for A Day,"My four-year-old daughter was thrilled when she received this, but the gloss wore off within 24 hours. Mothers of younger children will find that buying Baby Alive is alost like having another baby . . . children younger than about six will need help mixing her food, changing her diaper, cleaning her out afterward (so she doesn't clog up). My daughter usually wandered off just after Baby Alive ""made a stinky,"" leaving me to complete the cycle (and there's nothing a mother of four likes better than changing a plastic baby :). Our also makes an odd clacking sound for no particular reason (I think it's supposed to be fussing, but am not entirely sure). Baby Alive does have her moments (what, after all, is cooler than a doll who eats and poops?) and is really pretty cute and engaging, but given the rather limited interest my children have shown in her, I wouldn't rank her among my favorite recent toy purchases."
3,Baby Alive,"Well, my 3 year loves her to pieces, so that's really what matters. It is fun to watch her interact with the doll, but she does get bored with her pretty quickly and the constant talking (although, she does have an off switch--thankfully)can be a bit annoying. Overall, she is a fun doll, but a bit of a cash-cow because of the doll food, diapers, and juice."
4,My daughter loves this doll.,"I bought this for my [...] year old for Christmas and she really loves the doll. She thinks it is fun and really loves to feed it and change the diapers. The only thing I don't like is that she keeps saying she is hungry and needs a changing and my daughter thinks she has to keep feeding and changing her. It is costly to maintain if you let her feed and change it too many times a day. I agree with the other comments, you should buy regular diapers because they go through them quickly."
5,The hit of Christmas Day.,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old granddaughter. I must admit the idea of a doll that messes its diaper did not sit well with me, but that is what she wanted. The doll is so lifelike with all that it says and the way it moves its eyes, I am sure my granddaughter thinks it is alive! Everytime the doll says ""I'm hungry"", Emily insists that she has to feed her, even if she has just done so. When the doll says ""I love you Mommy"", it gets a hug and kiss and ""I love you, too"""
4,My daughter LOVES it!,"We are very happy with our baby alive! We got it for my daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it!It's very cute with all the I love you mommy's and yawns, etc.My daughter feels special playing Mommy with this doll (she is 6 1/2)She's had it sleeping in her little brothers bassinet and had it sitting on the potty, etc.The only thing about the toy is the need to purchase additional things, such as food, and diapers.I plan on seeing if Preemie or newborn diapers will fit this doll and purchasing those instead (I am convinced that has to be cheaper than purchasing the baby alive brand of diapers)Because she DOES pee and after she eats, she poops (bleck) the first time she pooped my daughter almost died!OH, you can dry feed and dry bottle this doll and she does not know the difference.All in all I am happy with the purchase, the doll is getting a lot of play and really seems worth the price we payed."
2,Baby Alive not a good value,"My daughter just had to have a Baby Alive last Christmas. We got her the doll, food and lots of diapers. She played with her daily for about a week and then went back to her other softer, prettier dolls. At first it was fun to have a baby that needed a diaper change. After a while, it became a chore. I would not recommend this doll. It hard and kind of heavy. As a parent, I didn't like the doll because I needed to supervise feeding and diaper changing. One day my daughter didn't get the diaper on correctly and the doll wet all over my couch. The food and diapers are expensive. I knew when I bought the doll I wouldn't like it. I was surprised when my girly-girl 7 year old didn't like it either."
4,Pleased with the product,This item met my expectations. My daughter is thrilled with Baby Alive and has carried her around since Santa arrived. My only wish is that the batteries could provide a longer play time.
3,Baby Alive review,This doll was purchased as a gift for my 3 yr old granddaughter because her mother was thinking it would be a big hit. I would not have purchased something like this... however...I cannot say enough about how Amazon.com dealt with me. There were some issues with shipping and they came thru wonderfully. I would always recommend them to anyone.As for the doll...we will see on Christmas MorningMerry Christmas--everyone!!!
4,Baby Alive Lives,Still in the box... This is a present for someone and it isn't time yet... I already know much about it from a friend who has one and they love it. It is adorable right out of the box ...;when you turn it on it says Hi Mommy... I'm hungry! The eyes open up and it smiles... Not really looking forward to eating and potty happening but that will be my granddaughters problem later on. I just enjoy the total package of this delightful toy.
3,Cute but not cute enough!,My daughters had to have this doll and of course I bought it but I have to tell you it really is a HUGE hassle. It's a big mess and buying all of the food and diaper replacements get's really expensive. My kids wanted to change the diaper every hour and feed her several times a day and once I told them they can't waste it all the doll wasn't as fun for them. They didn't even like sleeping with it because it just keeps talking and waking them up. They literally begged me to just turn it off so they could sleep at night. Now one year later the doll is just thrown in the corner of bed only to be played with once every six months. I just don't think it was worth all of the money.
2,Glad I only paid 29.99 for it.,"I had one of these for myself as a child and I remember how much fun I had, so I just had to get one for my daughter. Let me say my daughter loves this doll for the most part. She does get tired of it at times and doesn't want anyone waking her because she is a lot of work. Which could be good in the long run.But now I notice some things are not working right. I did what the directions recommend that you give her lots of water after a feeding to keep her clean. Now after two months of eating and drinking the sensor in her mouth is not working. She asks for food and you give it to her and her mouth doesn't move so she keeps telling you she is hungry. This is very upsetting to a small child who keeps yelling "" But I am feeding you. Your not eating.""She enjoys just having the baby and the other interactions with it. But it would be nice if did what it is suppose to do."
2,It Could Have Been Great........,"This could have been a great book had Gore Vidal decided that it wasn't about him. Many of his insights are excellent but marred by his acidic references to the current administration. There is plenty of great material here without Mr. Vidal deciding that it wasn't quite flashy enough unless he ""enriched"" it with his take on current affairs.There is a certain amount of entertainment value here but it is more a sideshow than a main event."
3,One man's view on the Founding Fathers.,"This is the first book I have read by Gore Vidal. This is probably not his best work, but you can see his political leaning in his writing. In his view, our present system is a tyranny, especially with the 2000 election in mind. In this book, he takes a negative view of our Founding Fathers. Perhaps other authors have made these men mythical, but Vidal returns them to the human species. They were men who made mistakes. None of them were perfect. However, I think Vidal is overly negative in his viewpoint of these men. They founded a new nation with great principles.The author jumps around quite a bit in this history. He also has some new history with the revelation of Hamilton as a British spy. I think the author came to that out of his own conclusions. This was a uneven read, and some of the language was difficult to understand. Maybe someday I will appreciate his writings if I adapt his poltical philosophy."
1,Misleading Title,"I admit that I have not finished the book yet and I may not. I picked this up from the library expecting a book about the founding of the USA with respect to our first three presidents. While that may be in the book, the book is primarily an anti-Bush diatribe. I am not one to defend President Bush but I can not stand intellectual dishonesty. In the book, Vidal states that invading Canada in response to 9/11 made as much sense as invading Afghanistan. While the issue of invading Iraq is and continues to be a controversial one, there has been very little opposition to our invasion of Afghanistan. Our current President Obama has stated many times that our fight against terror was in Afghanistan and not Iraq. For Vidal to state that Afghanistan had as much to do with 9/11 as Canada comes across to me as intellectually dishonest. His hatred of President Bush has made the book almost completely unreadable in my opinion."
1,Pseudointellectual,"I thought I loved history, but maybe because I didn't graduate from Harvard, I wasn't able to find any excitement in Vidal's history lesson. It felt more like a lecture than anything engaging. If only Dave Berry can collaborate with Vidal, then we may have something."
1,Unscholarly Rant,"In this poor excuse for a work of scholarship, Vidal spends his time (and ours) entertaining personal assumptions (see Publishers Weekly review), viewpoints, and pet themes. Why, in the middle of a purported historical work on the Founding Fathers, does he digress into making weak connections with the war in Iraq, his generalizations of contemporary America, and other unrelated, obviously biased drivel? If I want politically charged opinion on the topics of the day, I'll read Op/Ed pieces, or at least something that admits its bias from the onset. If you are looking for an unbiased, focused, and SCHOLARLY substantive work on the topic, read Ellis' Founding Brothers. It won the Pulitzer--because it is everything Inventing a Nation is not."
2,"Hardly ""fair and balanced""","Vidal is wittier than he is wise, more erudite than he is intellectually honest. Still, he is enormously entertaining and provocative. For more genuine insight about the characters of the nation's founding, I prefer the straightforward Joseph J. Ellis' Founding Brothers."
1,Creating history in his own image.,"I concede that history is written with some bias as to the opinion of the Author, but historians are, or should be, purveyors of those opinions, not the manufacturers of them. Historians are not writing history, they are in a manner of speaking, collecting and reporting on history as it was written. I would not recommend this book as a basis for understanding this period of time (Try Benson Bobricks - Angel in the Whirlwind, or McCullough's - John Adams). This book is history according to Mr. Vidal. His references to modern day events and persons are more an indication of his political leanings, than his connection of current events with events of the past. You can not understand the present by making moral judgements on historical individuals since they did not have benefit of your understanding of the past, conversely, they had no understanding of what was to come. History is becoming a victim of politics; when it should be an accounting of the past. Skip-it."
2,Warning,"This book about the founding of the USA is laced with anti-Bush diatribes. This is more political commentary than history. If this is what you are expecting, then you should enjoy this book."
1,Some history interspersed with the 'Hate Bush' propaganda,"I borrowed the audio book set of this book, not knowing anything about its author or his political views, hoping to get a greater insight into the minds of the founding fathers. Unfortunately what I found to be the most prominent subject matter of this work was the anti-Bush/Republican propaganda. Now, I do take exception with many of the policies and stances of the current U.S. presidency, however, if I wanted to research the effecacious practices of the current presidency I would have rather borrowed from my library a politically motivated work. I, for one, find no place for such subjectiveness in a work on what is supposedly historical truth. I prefer my history books to simply contain history, not political commentary."
2,Manipulative Nonsense,"I had never read a Gore Vidal book before. I was looking forward to it and even enjoyed the first twenty pages or so. Then Vidal starts manipulating history. I had no idea why he was distorting things until he went off on his tirade about corruption and the 2000 election that has no place in this book. I actually agreed with most of Vidal's points about corruption in current government, but there is no excuse for his manipulation of facts. He guesses at motives, or makes them smoothly fit into his ideals. The more I read, the more insane Vidal became. Making absolutely stupid conjectures about the founders' actions and how they would look shamefully upon this America (when they lived in an America where Tarring and Feathering was common). There are much more accurate books on the foundation of the country and much better books about the current political climate. Vidal's corruption of history is despicable."
2,Vidal's invention,"This work was my introduction to Vidal and, frankly, I was not impressed. While somewhat well researched, much of it is Vidal's personal opinion and sounds oddly like a more hardcore Republican Party revisionist take on the Constitution and the founding fathers than one might imagine from someone allied with the Democrats. His arrogance on the subject makes it almost laughable. Vidal's writing style is choppy and disjointed in places. The whole work is entirely unsatisfying."
3,"He's Probably Right, But Man is He Arrogant About It","Listen, I like Gore Vidal's work, I do. And he is probably right about a lot of things (though I seriously doubt his frequent inuendo that Hamilton might have been Washington's illegitimate son.) However, I cant help feeling like his attitude came through so much that it was distracting me from what he was saying. I listened to this book, unabridged, on audio book. Perhaps it was that Gore was reading it himself, and I got a real sense of how he ""felt"" about things rather than the history he was trying to convey? I don't know. But to Vidal, everyone was and is of sinister or selfish intent...except his friends, the Kennedy's (and Ben Franklin.) That's just the feeling I got.The audio book is worth the price of admission if for no other reason than to hear Vidals recount of a conversation with JFK at the end of the recording. Seriously, that part I'll give five stars."
3,Inventing the story of our our founding.,"A snippy, opinionated, disorganized presentation that causes one to question the credibility of the information after just a few chapters."
3,The real story of our nation's beginning,"Gore Vidal makes the same erroneous assumption that our country's beginning somehow magically started with Washington, Adams and Jefferson. The truth of the matter is that the foundations for the nation were laid in place before any of these three great men came into power as Presidents under the Constitution. Although Washington, Adams and Jefferson were largely responsible for the implementation of the Constitution, they were only part of a larger mosaic of leaders who were the true founders of this nation. If you want an account of the visionaries and originators of our ideas of government, and the leadership that actualized these ideas into being, then I suggest that you read my book entitled ""The First Executives: Lives and Events in the Shadow of the American Revolution."""
1,Supercilious Ego Trip,This book is all about how smart and witty Vidal thinks he is. Why doesn't he just build an altar to himslef so we can all worship at his feet? Enough already with the same lame stuff. Do not expect any serious insight about the founding fathers. He disguises lack of scholarship and historical understanding with dime-store psychology and tabloid journalism.
5,Faboulous book,"This book is really a keeper! Also, although second hand, it was in mint condition. My daughters also bought this book for their kids upon seeing mine that I had bought as a gift. Original drawings."
1,these are awful,"There is a reason why the yogurt is too sweet, It is not yogurt. It is yogurt flavored, buyer beware. These do not even taste like food. The Sunmaids are just a bit too sweet but not this bad. I would go with the sunmaid instead of these."
1,"A DISASTER! If you must go iolo, stick with SM 4...","""This product is full of pitfalls."" I have this on very good authority (my service technicians), although I personally haven't found but ONE, I guess, since the attempted installation corrupted my hard drive to the degree that even Safe Mode was unavailable. I really liked SM 4.0 Pro but, after this nightmare (and the subsequent lack of any help whatever from iolo), I urge you to stay away from 5.0. BTW, there are no refunds under ANY circumstances so, if your pc crashes (to the tune of $150 in my case) you'll also be out the cost of the program."
1,Junk Software,"Purchased the new Version 6, and it freezes... throws exception errors constantly, not ready for prime time. I would suggest avoiding System Mechanic until they release a version that works without requiring reboot after reboot to recover from freezes. The new version is even more problematic than Version 5. Flakey software. Tries to be a swiss army knife of utilities, and does nothing well. It's too bad, I would like to see a program like this be successful... but currently it should be avoided. Unresponsive technical support compounds the problem."
2,Alright Software,"The only thing that saves this product is it's registry cleaner. If you need a firewall or spyware remover don't bother with these, try Webroot's Spyswepper or Norton's or McAfee's firewall."

2,Caveat Emptor,"Do not waste your money on this product! The Spython malware detector has given false positives on 3 occasions with the latest spyware definitions. God only know what it would have deleted had I let it go ahead and remove the supposed spyware! In addition, I have found the system date intermittenly changing after running the clean up utility. It took weeks to track this down. (A security audit of system events was necessary to catch the culprit. Look for event id 520 in the log.)"
1,Zero stars and wishing it could be less,"Iolo's two flagship products are flawed and essentially unsupported. You're lucky if the newer versions install at all, and perhaps less lucky if they do. Be very careful that you don't allow iolo's tech support to drag out your problem(s) for more than thirty days, because if they manage to do so, you'll never get your money back! Tech support, customer support and any useful communication paths with the developers are all nonexistent. You will learn this at considerable expense, on hold, for great lengths of time during telephone calls you have to pay for. Iolo has no toll-free support lines."
1,JUNK SOFTWARE,I COULD NOT BE SORRIER FOR BUYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP. THIS THING FREEZES MY SYSTEM WHEN IT IS NOT TRYING TO REPORT BACK AN ERROR MESSAGE TO THE SERVER. I HAVE TO GO THROUGH MY RECORDS AND FIND OUT WHO PEDDLED THIS PIECE OF CRAP OF ON ME. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO SELL SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE MAKE SURE IT WORKS FIRST. SYSTEM MECHANIC SUCKS!
1,Don't be mislead by hype,"If you are dumping your computer anyway, then go ahead and waste your hard earned money. But, if you want to keep it, stay away from this product. I have six months of headache and still haven't got the registry compactor removed. At best I have the rest of the junk out and now have no more crashes, yet with part of it still compacting the registry, it takes forever to boot and then is slower than molasses. The only good thing about this product is I got it from Wallyworld and got my money back. If you want something that works get Norton System Works (spend a few more bucks). I don't use their anti virus or firewall after it expires but the rest of the package will work forever."

I only hope they survive our hiking trips & sometimes moist weather we encounter. The shipment came quickly & in great shape and for now I say YES to the purchase of these light compact binoculars."
1,Either CK Changed The Formulation Or Fragrance King Sells Fake CK Products,"I've been using Escape Aftershave Balm for several years. Always picked it up at the local department store. I decided to order this tube from Fragrance King . Was delivered in a timely manner via USPS. When I opened it I noticed it was a much thinner consistency but attributed that to the heat. However, after being inside for several hours the consistency was very runny. I checked the ingredients of the new one against the ingredients on the tube that just ran out. Sorta close, but not the same. Either CK changed the formulation (for the worse) or Fragrance King is selling a knockoff. Don't know which. I'll give this one to my 14 year old son and hope his face doesn't turn yellow or purple.No more aftershave from Amazon."
2,Not made for iPhone,"While this is a decent little pouch, it wasn't made for iPhone. Even arrived on a cardboard card with CAMERA BAG on it. The bag is a very loose fit. I was very disappointed to receive something represented as specially made for iPhone when it obviously isn't."
2,ONLY A CURSORY APPROACH TO A COMPLEX CONCEPT,"These series of tapes may at first seem to offer credible and accurate information for the viewer. Instead, these tapes try to take the very complex study of ""terrorism"" (political violence) and explain it in 60 minute intervals. The only utility of some of these tapes is the background information on some of the groups portrayed in the series. I would highly suggest any viewer to question the credibility of the information on these tapes and also note the dating of the material examined.As a scholar of political violence (""terrorism""), I would suggest viewers instead pickup books and journal articles to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon of ""terrorism."""
3,VHS ~ Terrorism-World in Shadows,"Interesting and informative within limits... however a bit outdated and lacking. The video leaves a viewer with more questions than answers. The overview of different kinds of terrorism are all viable within context, but they fall short without further research and independant analysis. A good visual support for anyone who has done the reading needed to fill in the gaps."
2,Fascinating but not practical,"I would agree with other reviews in that this book does not contain clear instructions. Many individual steps are cramed into a single confused diagram. Most of the instructions lack clarity and a simple step by step approach that is common to how-to origami books. I also am of the opinion that many of the folds are not good, clean origami. Additionally, even in the diagrams, several of the end result objects do not look like what they are intended to be. There is a basketball player project where the end result looks more like E.T. holding a crystal.More of the pages should've been used showing step-by-step instructions instead of short-cutting many of the diagrams into step-step-step by step-step-step drawings that look like the artist was as confused as most people attempting to use this book.This book is not for beginners or intermediate users. It might be a good book for experienced users looking for a challenge."
4,A picture's worth a thousand words,"After reading two grossly conflicting reviews, I decided borrow a copy of ""Fascinating Origami"" from a friend. My thoughts: this book is NOT for beginners - unless you ace all of Mensa's spatially oriented tests. On the other hand, if you have folded any of Montroll's medium-hard creations, you should be able to make it through the pictorial instructions without much trouble. (Most of the time. But use a scrap piece first, just in case.) The resulting models are also at a par with some of Montroll's best, making it well worth your while!"
3,Need to update their style,"This magazine is stuck in the 1980's - the style of most of the projects looks like stuff my grandmother would like (pictures of fruit and flowers). They rarely (although it DOES happen occasionaly - ie: Blackbird Designs was in there last year, with a great project) include the newer artists or styles. The exception is the yearly JCS Ornaments special edition - that is a must have, but I don't know if it is part of the yearly subscription. Most of the projects are still on aida, and most of them, again, are very outdated in style. I'd like to see more historical projects, more samplers, and more updated projects on linen before I will buy this magazine again."
4,Great creative springboard,"I had not picked up this magazine in several years, and am so pleased with the current issue that I will be subscribing to it again. The magazine is targeted to moderately experienced stitchers, and uses a variety of stitches, threads, fabrics and techniques to bring life to what can be a bit of a rigidly obsessional hobby. They do not specialize in easy country patterns as seems to be popular in many of the other magazines, and rather than focus on a trendy new thread, they bring creativity and life to the threads you probably already have. I will be using pieces of one of their samplers to decorate altar linens. I wish their charts were in more than one color and wish it were available for the Kindle, but wouldn't change anything otherwise."
4,"All blocks and bolts are very good, the stand could be a little better...","There's very little to complain about with this set of blocks and bolts. They are solid and cleanly machined. I'm tempted to give the product 5 stars, but a less than ideal stand could be a little better. The plastic portion of the stand is fine, but the backing is rather flimsy and I'm sure it will get scratched up over time. Really this is a minor point so it could be argued that the rating should be higher, but I like to reserve 5 stars for products that are nearly flawless. Either way, this product will certainly do everything you need of it for many years and the price is quite reasonable. In fact I'm guessing you might have a difficult time milling your own set from scratch for much cheaper than this."
4,tougher than the rest,"When all the other singers from this era has either lost it for good or are just chasing photo ops with young rock stars, this man is standing there, in the middle of the ring, and he's taken some punches. You can hear that in his voice. But he's still standing and the voice is getting more and more raw and powerful. This guy was #1 40 years ago with ""Quarter to three"" and is still up there. This live recording has tracks from the his biggest period, but lucky for us he also includes some great songs from his comeback cd:s from the early 80's. Only wished he'd included ""It's only love"" in his set. That's one true, priceless Beatles interpretation (from the ""Dedication"" -cd). So why only 4 stars? Well, the sound could've been better. But then again, that's always been part of the captivating charm of his records. Buy this record and listen to an American hero sing his heart out! And could somebody please put this man in the R&R hall of fame, where he belongs."
5,Because,"What If...by Gunnar Jensen is a series of questions posed by the author about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In a straight forward manner, Mr. Jensen answers these universal questions with a simplistic truth that's refreshing and comforting. I recommend Gunnar Jensen's What If... as great reading, to be digested in short doses so that one doesn't loose the essence of Mr. Jensen's questions."
1,Terrible waste of money,"I bought this product and its accessories for each of my three boys as a special end of summer fun day plan. I got them for 90 percent off at Toys R Us, and it was STILL a waste of money. The water won't squirt out, the silly string included quits after one good squirt (and it is far from empty), and it is hard to load and unload to even check it out to see what is going wrong. I had three very good sports--but very disappointed little boys. This is a bunch of hype with nothing real to show for it. If it had happened with one gun, I'd think it was just one faulty product, but it happened with all three."
4,"Fabulous, but don't pay 10$ more for the scallops","I just received this thin,elegant knife and soon put it to work. It went through cucumber and pepper like butter, with only a little more effort through hard carrot and it chopped the onion to the tiniest pieces. It fit right into my hands, which are of medium size. It's very comfortable to work with - I'm told it's better than the Santuko for the rocking motion. It's also pretty hydrophobic, which means it cleans easily. However, everything stuck to it just like a regular chef's knife, and I still had to scrape everything off on the edge of the bowl. The beautiful pattern, warm wooden handle and the extreme precision make it impossible for me to go back to my old Arcos, or to any of the Globals or Dicks I've tried."
1,This Bottle Is Terrible - It Leaks,"This bottle leaks. It's as simple as that. The flip lid comes open easily, and even when it's closed it's not very water tight. Read the description up above from Nalgene, where they say that it's not 100% water tight. What?????????? That's ridiculous. This bottle could and should have been designed better, and is not worth buying. Too many other options, and this one stinks."
3,Buy this for the art not the biography,"Like countless others I emerged from childhood loving the stories and artwork of Maurice Sendak. Now as an artist myself I would like to know more about him, his techniques and inspiration. The bio is a tiresome read. Obviously Selma Lanes adores Maurice Sendak judging by the gushy and somewhat sycophantic writing. I think she has been so careful to respect his privacy that there is nothing insightful written at all. I reckon she could have done a better job."
1,Do not!,Do not waste your money. It might be a better idea to go to the pedi place and enjoy your $30 put to good use.
5,A great overview of early colonial history,"What's quite remarkable about this book is its coverage of the early history of European contacts with Native Americans. These quite a lot of material on the events of the 1700's in other books, but Steele has the best coverage of the 1500's and 1600's I've encountered. It reads well, and takes a sweeping view of events. The later chapters are quite good, too!"
5,Practical World Class Management,"This is the best practical book on management that I have ever read. It gives general information that every manager should know, and it gives specific strategies to deal with management problems and concerns. I liked how Plenert shows that people perform based on what you measure them by. I also like how he stated that in order to be a World Class Manager, you must first become a World Class Person."
5,The Best Has Come!!,"This collection has to be the funniest adventures ever in the history of television. From sleeping on the Staten Island Ferry, to missing the Constitution, to stomping grapes in Italy, this is worth your money. Also, how they made the episodes slide into one another in sequence was amazing! If you buy this video collection, never say Bon Voyage to it!!"
4,Interesting,"Hmm, I never realized that TSR killed off this line of acessories. As far as I know, it is no more than two years old, and it's still fully viable on the webs ( heck, even Amazon carries a large selection of all things Birthright!). Nevertheless, Birthright is a unique setting, and it can be easily enjoyed. This book is a very good work on the nature of priestcraft in the world where this campaign is set ( and if it IS killed off, I advise you to get it quickly - out of print products don't linger too long on this site). It is also a very good work of AD&D priestcraft in general, and although it isn't as likely to help players as it will help DMs, but take my word - this book will ease the life of DMs immensely (remember that player whose priest would constantly stop to cast healing spells on everyone? Well, this book will stop that overconfident character dead in his tracks...)"
5,Excellent Text,"I am concluding a course in vibrations (UofWashington) and wanted to take a moment to recognize the author for the excellent text he has crafted. I have found many times through the quarter that simply sitting down and diving through its chapters taught me more than my professor ever could have.Specifically:-Excellent examples-Excellent derivations-Unique and effective approach to emphasizing fundamental pointsBut mainly this text excels because it never forgets the main point - to help newcomers understand the topic of vibrations. Highly recommended, even if you don't specifically need a text on vibrations. I think everyone could use a little more of chapters three,four,six and eight (if you're curious, buy the book!) :)Just my two cents.-Justin"
4,Traded in my old vibrations book for this one... great decision!,"So Im taking advanced vibrations (why else buy this book, right?) and I took a chance getting rid of my old vibrations book for this one. It turned out to be a great decision. This book covers the elemetary topics quickly and moves on to advanced topics swiftly, never bogging you down too much with the lengthy equations you find when solving those damped vibrations systems (high five if you know what Im talking about!). Great reference for my class and I will surely be holding on to it afterwards. About as easy as an engineering book is going to be to read. B+"
5,Principles of Vibration,I have found this book well written and extremely useful for any class involving vibrations.
5,"A Remarkable Woman, a Remarkable Story.","Tiny (Georgia Ann Thompson) Broadwick was the first woman to jump from an airplane, the first person to jump from a float plane, the first to make an intentional water jump from an airplane and the first to make a manually-operated parachute jump and all these records were prior to 1915. Tiny Broadwick demonstrated that parachutes could be used repeatedly, that escape from a damaged airplane was possible, that you would not pass out in freefall and that a woman could do something most men would not do. This book recounts history of a person that deserves greater recognition. It is easy and fun to read. As a skydiver (1,200 jumps, D-454), pilot (SEL & gliders, hang gliders and paragliders),author and publisher of seven books on parachutes and skydiving, I recommend this book to those interested in aviation and pioneering women. --Dan Poynter, Parachuting, The Skydiver's Handbook."
2,Hard Candy molds,"I thought they would be a sucker mold, as it said get suckered, maybe I will be able to use them, but was really looking forward to making suckers."
2,Substandard or just cheap budget? You decide,"A hokey implausible design space ship picks up a distress signal from an unvisited planet TEM4. Naturally they rush to the rescue to find ambivalent papules. ""No we did not send a distress call; we were just playing around with the radio.""While the crew is out hobnobbing with the friendly natives, the security officer back at the ship makes a subterranean discovery.Id the spaceship Cyrno and its crew going to be good buddies with the BOS or are they doomed due to lack of flood insurance?Maybe the pre-sci-fi or 50's feel is due to the film being produced at DEFA studios (East Germany) in the 70's.The version I watched was German with English sub-tittles. Very liberal sub-tittles that can be annoying if you know any German at all (or English for that matter). In an attempt to paraphrase, they do not quite match the speech or intent."
1,This Makes Ed Wood Look Talented,"While pretending to be sci-fi, this is apparently what 70's East German soft core porn looks like. This may be the worst film I have ever seen. Don't make the mistake I did: If you'd like a copy of the moderately interestingThe Silent Star, buy it separately. Don't waste your money onThe DEFA Sci-Fi Collection(which includes this dvd) like I did.And fyi, the title was meant with humor, I like Ed Wood in the ""so bad it's good category"". This actually makes Mr Wood look like a genius by comparison; it's just BAD."
3,not as good,"I don't think this album is a good as their other ones.Its not that bad,but compared to their earlier albums,it does't measure up"
3,Like many of the MS Press Books....Fair at best,"The information is not presented in an inteligent format. Most of the book is basic, and when it does go a little deeper it drops you off at the end. Windows is a huge, error prone, weak, buggy, sloppy OS. It needs much, much more than this book provides to ""RUN"" Windows."
1,"Parts are no longer available ""NLA""","BUYERS BEWARE as there are very few parts available for this DISCONTINUED Kitchen Aid appliance. This is shocking as I have a house full of their products. If you are very lucky you might be able to find maintenance O-Rings occasionally but that is about it. Pieces of the dispenser assemble broke on mine and this part is ""NLA"" or No Longer Available. This has left me with a $1200 item I cannot use. I used it four times, doing the math each cone of soft serve cost me about $200 each. There are also some sellers trying to sell-off their units for $2300 to $2500 these same sellers are not telling customers about the parts problem either. I find it quite shameful that some people attempt to sell products at more than twice the retail manufacturers' price as well."
2,not worth the money,"I read the preceding reviews and really question what I did wrong with this unit. I tried for 6 months to get this to work right and it never did. The ice cream would be too frozen to get to come out of the unit. even when I used it to make alcoholic drinks...it STILL froze up! (and alcohol is not suppose to freeze) Luckily, I had purchased it at Williams-Sonoma and even w/o a receipt, they refunded the purchase. I only wished it would have worked like it promised, it's an impressive unit and people would just look at it in awe but every time I used it, people would just be disappointed (especially me for what I paid for it!) Unless my unit was just defective, I will never know, but would not even risk trying to buy it again! It is a beautiful unit, but that alone is not worth paying $$$$ to have it as a pretty countertop decoration."
3,Very good,"This product is excatly as they advertised, is nice and perfect size to place at the edges of an envelope or cd box."
2,more info needed,"It would help if you would include the diameter of these labels - it's impossible to judge from the small photograph, and size is obviously an important factor!S Kokker"
2,clear seals,"I didn't know that these seals had perforations in the center. This is not what I wanted. Also, I think over $7.00 for shipping is ridiculous for a product that is half that cost and could have been mailed for about $1.50 at the post office."
2,They don't stick well under pressure,"We used these for invitations. Careful - if you are using any glossy paper they will not stick. We ended up using Avery silver stickers, and they worked well."
4,"Size = 1"" diameter","I could not find the size anywhere in the listing/description. FYI - per the photo of the package, looks like the size is 1"" diameter."
2,Painful journey,"I've been reading through this series from the first book up to this one. This is not my favorite author by a long shot. She's horrible with dialogue. Harry and Susan are supposed to be best friends since school, but their conversations are stiff. I've never liked Susan but I can't tell you why. I just don't think that I would ever be friends with her. And here's the funny thing -- I can't stand the animals! I know, I know. Why would I read these books then? I guess I get caught up in the story and want to know who the murderer is. I've gotten to where I totally skip over anything in italics. Maybe I should just stop reading these books. If you enjoy talking animals then you would probably like this book. If not, then I don't recommend it. I found myself just reading it to get to the end so I could start a book I enjoy, one without talking cats."
2,I thought I would like this book.......,"This is my first Rita Mae Brown book......and probably my last. I really thought I would like this book, but I didn't. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing specifically wrong with it (hence the 2 stars). It's just that there's (much) better stuff out there to occupy my time. This book was like reading the Manhattan telephone directory. The plot wasn't much, but the cast of characters was great! Even with a list of the main characters (27!) and a brief description of each in the front of the book, I still got confused sometimes. Someone else may thoroughly enjoy this book, but I didn't."
3,Loose Plot,"I do enjoy the Mrs. Murphy mysteries, but it sometimes is frustrating because the plots are loose. This book is like that as well. In this book there are some mysterious shenanigans in an exclusive private school in Crozet. Why are people affiliated with St. Elizabeth's dying? Murphy and her pals Tucker and Pewter are bound to find out. And their human, Harry, also gets there in the end, but not before she usually ends up in a one-on-one situation with a murderer. I like the characters in these books, and I think that's what keeps me reading."
1,A bad joke.,"It is a good thing I didn't bother with the 15 reviews preceeding mine before I read through this book. As of this date the majority of those who have read these reviews and bothered to vote on them have not found any of them helpful even though the book has received a perfect, stellar, rating. And it is also a rather good thing that I am able to get this ""mystery"" series in the paperback swap section of my local library. It certainly isn't worth spending good money on. Rita is the only mystery author I know of who has the audacity and mendacity to give a sales pitch for merchanise tie-ins at the end of every book in her series. Bad form.Just exactly who is dear Rita trying to kid with the likes of Jody Miller? Jody's behavior is at the very least outragious and nobody bothers to find out why. Nor is there any indication that serious efforts were made to find out who really gave her that shiner. It must really be nice being a juvenile delinquent in Rita's version of Crozet."
4,Entertaining Characters Enhance Lightweight Mystery,"MURDER ON THE PROWL is one of the better novels in Rita Mae Brown's popular ""Mrs. Murphy"" series, and like all books in the series it is set in Crozet, Virginia--a small town where cats and dogs occasionally set out to help their humans solve whatever murders occur in their midst, which in this story center around a private highschool.The premise is extremely whimsical, and the plot is scarcely the tightly structured creation found in classic detective and mystery fiction; in fact, most readers could safely float a battleship through some of the holes. But even so, Brown's talent for creating entertaining, likable characters makes for an extremely enjoyable read, and if you're able to accept the premise and overlook the plot's foolishness you'll have an extremely good time."
1,uninteresting subject matter...,"does NOT compare to The ""Cat Who"" series by Lillian Jackson Braun, whose books were humorous and easy to follow fiction"
4,Vintage Monster rock music!!!,"I just bought this CD and the music is real vintage rock music with a monster theme to it! It seems it's from the 50s or 60s,but hard to say which time period. My only 2 complaints is that each track song listed on the back cover does not have it's release date! and the thin booklet that comes with it only have photos of some of the bands with no written commentary on this music genre. I wish it did! The sound quality is great and clear and some of the songs have a rockabilly sound to it with cheezy vintage terror sound effects! Awesome!I give it 4 stars for the great spooky music but 1 less star because no release dates on each track song."
1,I got Screwed,"I sent for this item, the song selection is great, but it has a manufacturing defect, there is very noticeble unwanted noise throughout the CD. I was told to print a return tag and package it for UPS, I was sent a second copy of the CD with the same manufacturing defect, I wrote to Amazon and told them that I do not have a printer and asked if they could send me a printed return tag, they did not send me a return tag but they did charge me for this useless CD twice. Now I have two useless CDs that they charged to my credit card and they never replied to my complaint. This after being a long time customer who has spent thousands of dollars here. So much for customer respect.~John Alfano"
2,None,"Flew has some good points, he's well read and obviously an intelligent individual. His style, however, is irritatingly talkative, and any good argument is muddled by jargon and pointless polemic."
1,Flew has rejected these arguments himself.,"It has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher. Antony Flew, the world's number one atheist (at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments) has recanted his atheism.Philosophically, Flew was a rationalist. Having accepted the empirical evidence of intelligent design in nature, he was able to liberate himself from the tunnel vision of rationalism and hence from the shackles of irrational atheism.Flew himself would give this book one star. So, I don't think it ungracious to do the same."
4,Smells great.,I bought the sample for my son. I didnt realize the shipping was so much until I already placed my order. It came earlier than expected so that kind of made up for it. It smells awesome so we will probablly get a large bottle.
4,Crave by KK for men 2.5oz spray,"Its a great scent, light and clean with a spicy touch. The only thing I didn't care for was the unusual spray mechanism on the bottle. It has functioned perfectly every time but the configuration makes holding the bottle somewhat awkward."
1,Do not purchase from this supplier,Warning! This item was never received from this supplier. They do not respond to email queries at all. I want a refund.
2,This is not Crave,"Crave was always my favorite cologne, and was sad when CK stopped making it a few years back. I was surprised to find Crave on Amazon, and ordered a bottle.It arrived yesterday, and I immediately sprayed it on, and something didn't smell exactly right. It smelled... too chemically. This morning, I sprayed it on my left and a squirt of my original Crave (only a tiny bit left) on my right hand. Two roommates confirmed what I suspected. That this scent is not exactly like the original.Although, the new one is not bad, it's just not as pleasant."
1,EPSON are jerks,"Had a USB cable been included with the printer, I might have given this printer a higher rating. As it is, I can't plug it in and test it. This is the first indication tome that EPSON are going to be a bunch of jerks."
3,Great while it lasted,"The dreaded nozzle clog has hit me - no matter how much I clean the head and whether the ink cartridges are new or not, the printer will not print correctly. It used to print great color and worked well without any paper jams. I used cheap replacement ink and although it protested by telling me it was non-genuine epson ink, it still worked ok. The CD tray was problematic from the start and I think it's a common theme among most users of this model. SO, if you're looking at this model as a used unit, be very wary about the remaining life on these printers. I've been reading horror stories about Epson's attempts to get you to buy their ink so also be aware of that issue also."
2,The most frustrating printer I've ever purchased,"Sure, the quality of the prints are great and the ability to print onto CDs/DVDs is awesome - *IF* you can get the printer to feed the CD/DVD tray or good quality paper. I purchased this printer about 8 months ago and it started acting up after the first few months... now it's a giant, frustrating paperweight - Sitting on my desk, mocking me.It's not like I don't feed it plenty (and I mean PLENTY) of ink whenever it's hungry.Ungrateful little printer..."
2,This printer sucks,I had the R220 and it was better then the 340. With the 340 the CD/DVD tray sticks. If I don't push it in myself it will get stuck and give me an error. Don't buy this printer.
1,don't buy if you want to print on disk!,I bought this so I could print on dvd's. I can't believe how cheep this is designed. The manual disc feed tray worked twice and now it will not feed! Constant errors. I have never been so frustrated with a piece of equipment!I can't believe Epson has gone down hill so much. Anyone know if HP is going to make a disk printer?
5,Love this printer!!,"This printer works great! Colors vibrant and easy to use.I bought it for the feature that prints onto CDs/DVDs and use it for my work. It makes a very professional looking ""label"" on DVDs/CDs that looks like it's burned right on to the DVD (instead of those labels that stick onto the DVD which can get stuck in your computer or DVD player and ruin it!)"
5,The True Meaning of Halloween - Candy!,Mick Foley has once again written an instant children's classic. He uses his witty humor and rhymes to produce a wonderfully written halloween book for children of all ages. It is a must read for any fans of his writing and comes highly recommended.
4,Not one of his best but still worth reading,There are two types of law the street law and the the law enforced by cops like John Stefanovitch this book is all about the battle of the these two laws. Just when you think one or the other is getting a head in the game something happens that turns it all around. Even though this is not one of James Patterson's best novels it is still a good solid read with a good feeling ending. I would still recommend this book to anyone who likes crime dramas.
3,"Not bad, but nothing beats Cross","Not a bad book, just not an Alex Cross book. Patterson does Cross so well, everything else is inevitably compared against it. A somewhat predictable plot coupled with a lead character that is a stretch of the imagination. (would a partially paralyzed police detective be aloud to continue to work the street?) make this an ok read. Hard core Patterson fans, like myself, will excuse the plot and character deficiencies, but I certainly wish he would stick to Cross novels, it is what he does best."
4,My first Patterson book and I found it a page turner! Nice!,Nicely written! I enjoyed the book a lot. It really kept me going especially the villain St.Germain. The last 75 too 100 pages unfolded very rapidly. Some parts of the ending and begining were predictable. I believe the book contained exciting characters. It had just the right amount of drama and suspense. It was very exciting to read. The setting in Manhattan reminded me much of back home. I could easily picture everything. I felt like a character in the book.I look forward to more James Patterson books. Job well done!
2,Slow paced for Patterson,Not on the same level as patterson's other work. I found it remarkably hard to stay involved. The characters were lacking in depth
3,Good offering from Patterson despite plotholes.,"I have enjoyed most of Patterson's books I've read and this is no exception. The Midnight Club had and interesting sequence of events as you seem to start reading at the end of the story but its just the beginning. I really enjoyed that aspect but there were some huge plotholes that really held this book back. Overall, another decent read."
1,defies credibility,"If this had been the first James Patterson I read, I would have definitely never picked up another. The idea that a writer can come and go at will, into the top secret meetings of the NYPD or be given admittance to a top secret multi-force operation in Atlantic City is incredible enough.But when the most evil man on earth personally calls the protagonist and gives him the broadest clue possible of what he is going to do and our hero doesn't catch on, I couldn't believe it. I knew from the first words what would go down, and expected him to leap into action to protect his girlfriend and her son, get them into hiding. But no.And that had to be the most lackluster romance ever. It could have been good, if written with the slightest skill.Don't bother with this one..."
3,"Good, but not his best","If you like a book with a ton of twists and turns, this one has them. Not sure where I wanted this book to go, even after I finished it. It left me wondering..."
2,not good..couldnt get into it,I just couldnt get into this book at all. it starts out okay but then it just plateaus and nothing exciting happens. not worth it.
3,"Okay on audio, but not his finest!","This is a bit too convoluted with characters to hold interest and some of the characters aren't developed as well as they are in most of Patterson's books. I've read many of the non-Alex Cross books and found them as wonderful as all the others, including the Murder Club series...but this one just wasn't my favorite. I found myself hurrying through it without fully listening just so I could move on to another book. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, still better than a lot of mystery authors' works, but just not the full greatness of James Patterson!"
3,THE MIDNIGHT CLUB,DIDN'T ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS OTHER JAMES PATTERSON BOOKS. JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE A 'REAL FEEL' TO IT.
2,"So predicatble, so very, very predictable","Nothing much to say. Lets see, after you are put in a wheelchair and your wife and partner are killed by a crime boss, you go and taunt him and then are surprised that he comes after you and your girlfriend in her home. Hmmm, maybe staying hidden might have been a bit smarter...Like I said, no suspense, no thought required. James Patterson has many good books. This however isn't one of them"
2,no midnight reading,"The book starts great. Interesting characters, with high expectations as to how the plot will develop. Three quarters through the book it becomes predictable, and with to many loose ends."
2,That Darn Suspension of Disbelief,"The Midnight Club is a book with interesting characters, a nice premise and plenty of action...unfortunately it just doesn't work.These fine attributes are woven together in a plot that fails the dreaded test of believability. The arch-enemy of the hero is so cartoonish, so archetypal that you cannot suspend your disbelief and soon find yourself guessing (correctly) what is going to happen next. When this is combined with the contrived love story, the disappointing ending and the overused ""saving the damsel in distress"" convention, the book just plain flops.Patterson has written other works worth reading, I suggest staying with Along Came A Spider or Jack and Jill if you are interesting in reading this author, but avoid this particular offering."
3,"Not one of his best, but still a good one.","Having a main character, John Stefonovitch, as a wheelchair bound man was not a good way to go because I myself am not wheelchair bound, nor is anyone in my family. Altogether, the book was good. He was very descriptive at crucial times, such as the Atlantic City scene, really making me feel like I was there."
2,Blah! Don't waste your time...,"No, no Patterson, what has happened to you? Is this the same man who wrote Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls? Surely not. Please try harder next time."
2,"Compared to Patterson's other books, this was disappointing.","I loved all of Patterson's other books and was excited to see a new one on the shelves. However, my excitement lasted for about the first 10 pages. The plot was contrived, the characters were shallow (although I loved the hero in the wheelchair.. it was heartening to see his troubles and triumphs), the dialogue was stilted. I kept thinking that this must have been one of Patterson's early works before he learned how to REALLY write."
1,What a waste of time,The characters were impossible to identify with; the conversation incredibly far-fetched. Every charater was gorgeous and built (yeah right). The plot was ridiculous.
3,Pretty tame stuff,"THE MIDNIGHT CLUB was disappointing. It was brilliant at times but strayed too often into irrelevant stuff and suffered from rather contrived sub plots. Maybe it's because I read this book after reading THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, which was magnificent, but I just found THE MIDNIGHT CLUB pretty boring considering the great talent of its author."
3,Hard to get into Midnight Club,This book was hard to get into but once into 12 to 15 chapters it gets better. It does not read like a James Patterson.
3,Worth the time it takes to read it,"I don't think James Patterson will ever write as good as he does when he writes about Alex Cross. However, this is the first NON Alex Cross book of Patterson's that I have been able to finish. The story in this book was a good one, but it got a little confusing with so many different members of the Club. I felt the author should have focused more on the one main villain in the Midnight Club rather than trying to draw in more of them and show their different personalities. This was a fairly decent read, but I felt that putting the lead character in a wheelchair was a forced flaw. Most of Patterson's lead characters are really not flawed at all, but this one was way too obvious. I felt that the love story was a bit predictable and it seemed forced to me. The contempt these two characters felt for each other at the beginning was a waste of time - it was obvious how that would turn out. All in all, not bad for not having Alex Cross."
1,Pure hokum,"Isn't it about time to put the paranoia sub-genre to rest? It's been done over and over. The hero just can't trust anyone. The villain is a superman with absolutely no morals. I've read most of the James Patterson novels, and he vacillates between really good and pure nonsense. This book is from the latter end.The sadistic and perverse sex doesn't add anything to the book. Really, now, naked 12-year old girls? Torture? Rape? I'm not a prude, but I objected to all this sexual melange because it was obvious that the writer threw it in, not because it developed the plot but because it would--well, you supply the rest of that.Patterson has given us much better books. Much, much, much better. This one is a waste of paper and reading time."
2,It's a Sleeper!,"Unfortunately, this is one of James Patterson's book that I couldn't get into. I guess I am hook on Alex Cross who always keeps you guessing what will happen next. Where as John Stefanovitch is someone I couldn't stay awake for! There are some James Patterson's books that have a slow start but it flows right to the end. This is one that goes nowhere very, very, slowly!"
4,"Slow starter, but give it a chance.","Fans of Patterson's Alex Cross novels may be disappointed by the style of this book. This book reads more like the early work of an emerging talent. The book does not grab you from the start and requires patience and a chance to develop.However, if you give it a chance, this book is surprisingly enjoyable."
1,Its killing me to try to finish this book,"I love Patterson, but this is the worst of his books. I'm having a very difficult time getting through this one. WAY too long and drawn out. I don't care enough about the characters one way or the other."
3,Ho Hum,"I thought I would be able to get through this book in an afternoon, since I usually go through James Patterson's 400-500 page books in a day or two. This one took me quite a bit longer to complete. The story was allright and had a lot of potential, but I got a bit confused at times with all the different villains to keep track off. My biggest problem though was that I could not relate to any of the lead characters. I think the book could have been a lot better if I did."
2,Not as good as the Alex Cross Novels,"I thought this book was slow. I kept hoping it would pick up, but it didn't really. At some points I thought it was just plain silly, for example when the detective in the wheel chair went up to St. Germain in the limo and bawled him out. Also, it was so obvious that the girlfriends son was going to get kidnapped. The ex-husband takes him for a while to get him away from all the dangerous stuff, and then when the dangerous stuff really get going the son is back home walking to school. Da dee Da......"
3,This is not a new book.,"This is not a new JP book. It was first published in 1989, which may be one of the reasons it's not as good as the much later Alex Cross books. I'm almost half way through the book, and I must admit that it's just ""OK."" From the other reviews, I'm not sure if I should bother finishing it or not--but I probably will."
2,Kinda nasty,It was helpful but it was ewwI guess I'll use it more if I need help when only guys are home
3,Good information in a not so great package,"Haven't read this in detail but skimmed through it. My first impression was that it looked very ""homemade."" The title is pixelated and the pictures are pretty bad. It is not very fun for a kid to look through. However I was glad I bought it. I tried explaining a period to my daughter and found myself fumbling on some points that she explained very well. We both liked her description of a period as ""practice"" for when you are ready to have a baby."
2,books for 10 year old daughter,"Did not like the way this book was presented. There are many books that contain the same informaiton but in a much better format that make it fun and educational for the younger girls. Would not recommend this book, even though the cover is fun and colorful! Too ""academic"" for the purpose."
4,Puberty Survival Guide for Girls,I purchased seven books about puberty to read before determining which books to give to my 10 year old daughter. There were a couple of books that I held back because they talked too much about sex and masturbation. I liked this book because it gave the basics of how her body will change in puberty and what the menstrual cycle was. Some of the other books had too much information for a 10 year old who doesn't even know what puberty is. This will give her the basics and we can add the sex discussion at a later date.
2,Table Book Only,"I was dissappointed by this book. Not sure what I was expecting. Think perhaps more hints, reading, ideas and things like that. However, the book is very colorful so would make an acceptable coffee Table book."
1,Warning-do not use with cigarette lighter,"I bought this because my blower fan went out and I needed some source of heat in my car until I could get it repaired. This unit has a heating element that is very small yet it still manages to frequently blow fuses. Well I found out why. A tag on the cord says ""Do not plug it into the vehicle cigarette lighter. "" Well, where else is it supposed to be plugged into with its 'cigarette lighter looking' plug? I have a socket in the cargo area of my Passat but then how can the heater warm me in the front seat and defrost my windshield? I am returning it after 3 blown fuses. My curling iron throws off more heat than this... I wonder if I can plug THAT in to my vehicle cigarette lighter..."
4,"Worth it for ""Shintaro""...","Even though I have this collection (in some form or another) from owning ""Brazil"", ""Contraband"" and ""Men At Work-Puttin' in Overtime"", finding ""Shintaro"" on ANY CD, much less in record form,is nearly impossible! I purchased this CD just to have this single. Any other MAW fan from way back, who enjoys the concert songs would pay for this single. :)"
4,Update Of Track Listing,"This is a great album with all of their biggest hits; however there is an error in that Tracks 13 & 14 are not listed on either the label or the CD. Track 13 is ""Sail To You [Extended Remix]"" and Track 14 is ""Down Under [Extended Remix]"" These 2 songs aren't really that great (maybe that's why they're not listed), but that does not reduce my overall opinion of this CD."
5,The Works of Men at Work,This is really a great one to one that would like to know moreabout Men at Work! END
4,Good set of step blocks...,"These blocks are well made and work just fine. Considering that they are just simple hunks of machined steel, I'm not too sure what they could have done wrong, but they are good, so what can I say. If you need 'em, buy 'em."
3,Understanding Mental Illness and Schizophrenia,I bought it to use in the Abnormal Psychology class I teach. It is better for families and friends of someone diagnosed with schizophrenia. Very informative but not quite what I was looking for in a classroom setting.
5,Deep description of Iran people,"I found this book very interesting. Actually I bought the book to know more about Iran people and more or less I could see better. This anthology spread from 1921 to 1991, an enough comprehensive to review Iran literature, especially in short stories, a new genre in Iran literature."
4,Story-teller,"Alexander King was the first great raconteur (in the Viennese tradition) we saw on TV. Also see his first book, ""Mine Enemy Grows Older."" Funny, touching, perceptive writing.Mine Enemy Grows Older"
4,"Good beginner book, but could use more flair","I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter who shows a lot of interest in Spanish. She was able to immediately jump into the book, learning correct pronunciations and phrases. In the first hour she was already asking what my name was in Spanish. The material is basic enough to be ""up to date"". On the downside the book is all black and white and has no multimedia component. It will have a difficult time keeping the interest of a 4th grader."
5,I love it,I'm using it for an adult beginning Spanish class and we are probably going through it faster than one would with children however I found the elementary approach very good.
5,Madden 2007 Rocks!!,"This is the most realistic game out there! I can't believe how real the players look and move. The franchise and off-season segments are even better than before. My son loves the game, and I don't have to worry about any violence like some of those other games!"
4,Nice Buy,I enjoy this madden. It reminds me of the old madden play in the 1990's. Very competitive not easy to fuble or intercept the ball. Real football quality.
2,madden 07 game cube,"i have always liked madden games, but i found this one to be hard to control the players. and it lacked in graphics."
2,What the description doesn't tell you,I can't really tell you how much fun the game is. It wasn't untill I tried to save it the first time that I discovered that the game requires 173 memory units. So if you are looking to buy this better get a second memory card cause this game will eat alot of one.
4,nostalgia,"I'm a music teacher and I speak Italian very well. I heard most of this CD while cleaning up after a Tuscan-themed Teacher Appreciation Lunch at my own son's school. I think this CD is a great find: contains a whole bunch of music I wasn't familiar with; witty lyrics, and a real authentic, not-overproduced feel. I really had not heard indigenous Italian jazz, and now I find that it's great stuff. I'm pretty picky--for instance, love Putamayo's Gypsy Caravan and Arabic Groove but detest Jewish Odyssey. So for what it's worth, that's my opinion."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful fun CD","This CD is AWESOME. Wow. I popped it in as I was driving to work the other evening. It sent me right back to long lunches in Firenze, gawking at tourists in Rome (and pretending I wasn't one), and the amazing beauty of Venice (and that cute waiter who flirted by telling me he ""couldn't tell I was American"" and that I spoke Italian with a ""perfect accent""). Amazing music - some classic, some contemporary, but all great. Some of the songs are swingy, some are bluesy, some tell a story, some make you *feel* the story. If you have ever had un caffe in Venice or alcuni biscotti a Roma or cenato nel trattoria a Firenze, get this CD and remember. Ten stars."
4,Charming collection,"A charming collection of Italian songs that will transport you to the picturesque little place in Trastevere. Not the ""Arrivederci Roma"" of the tourist joints. I play this in my car while commuting and arrive at work refreshed and smiling. As a student of Italian, my only complaint is that the CD didn't include lyrics."
1,One Star For the One Track I Liked,"I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead."
1,italian cafe,"hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it. hate it. i've ordered other french/italian music and love it but NOT these."
1,"another bad.. no wait, horrible cd by Purumayo","a terrible cd. nothing Italian about it. Nothing good either. at first listen , I knew it was sub-par. Hated it."
1,"Sorry, but awful","Could not get past the first two cuts. Noisy and unpleasant---nothing like what I'd imagined I'd get (melodic, semi-romantic). Phew."
3,so-so,"I love Italian music but this CD has left me to desire more, the songs are short and could be better. A few good songs but not worthy of buying the whole CD."
3,I have a biozone 3000,It works and i like it but its not worth 100$All this is a plastic case with a fan and a light bulb. You are forced to buy the light bulb at $50 dollar increments every year. there needs to be a knock off light bulb for 5 bucks made out there. But also this is hardly a 300 dollar product it needs to be brought down to under 100 a big rip off... very unfortunate another company needs to do this better for consumers!
4,DIFFERENT,This doll is beautiful...I have not seen this one in my area. This will be my daughter's first BRATZ but I will order more .
5,One of the coolest bratz dolls i have.,"I got this toy yesterday,and i'm enjoying it!!!(Sunday,August 16,2009).The doll has a lovely scent and the doll comes with flower tools."
5,Hoots and Howls,"This is a great book of sublime, witty, insightful, hilarious and melodic poetry from the best. I love Sara."
5,Great for getting into YouTube/Podcasting,"Good quality sound. Easy to use, Affordable and portable.Definitely beats the built in microphones that you're used to and will give many mics in this price range a run for their money.Check out this video on my YouTube channel for an idea of how it sounds - [...]"
3,Great quality mic - but easily damaged,"I bought this for my fiancé, who travels on tour all the time. The quality of the mic was great, but after just a few uses, the USB port on the mic got bent and damaged. It is now unusable, only months after purchase. So frustrating. So just be careful when you use it and unplug it!!"
4,"GREAT quality, good starter mic!",i've had this mic for 5 months. I use it for commentating and skype calls. a downfall to this mic is how quiet it is! you have to be about a foot and a half away to get loud enough sound. really clear audio though. not a lot of background noise.
5,Great Microphones for beginners,I brought this for my son to use for his music production class and it worked really well. We received our shipment on time and the price was reasonable
4,Works Well,"Used primarily as the audio source for recording online video tutorials. The space in which you record is very important. If you have a dedicated area where the microphone and other recording equipment is set and stays in place, you should be able to produce good quality results in a very short period of time. If you have to move your recording area around all the time, you could get very unpredictable results in volume and voice quality.Overall a great product for the price, but as with any recording environment, be sure to test before you start recording to establish consistent recording results."
2,Weak performer,Purchased this product from Amazon. The signal from this microphone is extremely weak even with the volume set at 95. I've replaced this with an Audiotechnica AT2020USB.
3,"Good for the application; picks up too much ""air""","I've had this mic for several months now, and wish I could increase my rating to 5 stars.It is so easy to use.I had problems with too much reverb at first but that was solved by pointing it at a blanket instead of at me while I was recording."
1,"Crap customer support, crap product","I've bought three of these now for employees to use for video production. Every. Single. One. Has had on and off detection issues in Windows 7. Two, after a single week of use, simply refused to be detected at all across four different machines.After contacting Blue Microphones about it, they ignored us for two weeks, finally saying they would RMA it. Nothing happened. Weeks later still nothing has come of it. If you Google about this product and its company, you'll see the same stories.Stay away from this company and their products, there are other products out there that work very well and are supported by companies who understand what prudence and customer service is."
1,Does not work with Vista,"I'd like to reinforce what the previous reviewer stated about the incompatibility of this microphone with Vista. Blue's user support has been utterly unhelpful with this problem. None of my phone calls were returned and the few comments posted on their online forums by user support have been rude. They have flatly refused to give any indication as to when or if the problem will be solved. Instead, they blame Microsoft and even suggest creating a separate XP-only partition on your hard drive so you can use this mic. The simple truth is that you won't be able to use this mic if you have a Vista machine. Read the forums on Blue's website for more on this before you waste your money. Good luck."
1,No luck on Windows XP,"Bought this mic on the positive reviews here - could not make it work on my Windows XP system. Manual stated that latest firmware was already installed, and no drivers required. I went to the website, and found many issues in the forum on use with Audacity, and in general not working.Brought my Samson USB from home to try - no problems at all.Be sure you verify that it will work on your system from someone already running - wished I had looked into the company forum prior to purchase.Seems like the Mac people have had better luck than the Windows users.Also, included stand does not work good. You can raise the mic, but it does not stay - just slides back down."
1,Lousy service,"I purchased this mic and it did not work well. Got a lot of noise in the recording from the USB input. I returned the mic per the instructions and have yet to receive a refund as I requested. I contacted the merchant via e-mail and have not heard back from anyone. So, the service was poor and the mic was worse."
3,If your Snowball is not working...,"I bought this to use with my Windows 7 64-bit computer and my Mac when needed. It worked fine with my Win 7 machine until one day I used it with the Mac and then plugged it back into the Windows computer. It would not work. I finally discovered that the usb cable that connects to the snowball (at the mic) can be plugged in UPSIDE DOWN. Either way it will light up, but it will only be recognized in the correct orientation. Looking at the connection on the back it doesn't appear possible but it CAN be inserted either way. The box on my Snowball says 2009 and I have it plugged directly into the computer (not a hub). Once it's working it sounds great (5 stars). Can't believe Blue didn't catch this fault during preproduction. I'm sure this is the cause of many a bad review for the Snowball."
2,Great mic...not easily carried.,so after having this mic for a little while i discovered how fragile the little plastic usb connector piece was.i unplugged the usb from the mic and i came out along with it.The mic has done me wonders up until now.it really sucks that that happens since i cant put any music out now.
4,It should be called the snowawesome,"It's just really a great and easy microphone. It is exactly where it should be priced, and it does exactly what you want it to do. It is not a professional microphone. But the sound quality between this and a crazy expensive pro microphone isn't that huge. And the difference between this and a gaming headset mic or an iphone headset mic is enormous.Buy it quickly. Also get a pop filter for it if you're doing video game commentary. Trust me."
5,Great Mic for recording and podcasting,"I've had this mic for a few months and love it. I'm amazed by it's versatility, I've used it to record my band, both live and in studio. I've also used it for podcasts as well...everything sounds so clear through this mic...In addition, it's so easy to use and doesn't require an audio interface, which are expensive, because it plugs directly to your computer via USB. Finally, It looks really cool and fits right on your desk."
5,Soooooound,"My classical guitar teacher introduced me to BLUE -- goooooood sound, and I'm particular. Easy to set up. Fun sleek shape. Doesn't take up much space. Light weight. I'm having a blast with it."
2,High frequencies,Its all great and all but the snowball has too much of a hissing in the background. Too much Background noise for me. If you don't know how to edit vocals well then don't get this mic. for music recording. It records High Frequencies too much which makes it a pain to EQ and compress vocals for that quality sound in music.
1,"Terrible product, even worse support","While I fully believe that I received a lemon, Blue's support staff claimed that my four Macs running Leopard were to blame for the Snowball not being recognized and/or only sending an over-modulated static signal. All of my Macs have successfully used other USB mics without additional drivers, so I do not believe Blue's assertion that these problems are Leopard's fault. Apple sells this product in its own stores. It wouldn't if it were truly incompatible with its OS. Blue's support offered no help except to suggest that return the product for a refund.I would have been happy to receive a replacement, however, the unhelpful and seemingly uninterested help from Blue has made me decide to never buy another Blue product."
2,Plug and Play? I don't think so,I've tried over 3-4 different USB microphones all advertised as Plug and Play on my computer and I get nothing but static. When I talk into them I get a robotic voice. And yet any analog mic I attach to my comp works perfectly. I'm having a hard time trying to find a good analog microphone to buy since it seems the market is filled with USB mics now. This is the way of the future? Then someone needs to make some kinda actual downloadable driver update for these devices.
3,Not as good as expected,"I really do like this microphone. It has good quality audio recording ability. I think I was a little surprised at a few things though. There are basically no instructions, as if you just bought an Apple product. It three settings, which it briefly explains, but which have very little recording difference. I do not have a booming voice, so I was disappointed at its pick up. It is extremely low. You can find other reviews that say the same thing. It is clean pick up, but low volume. I have to really make an effort and stay close to the mic to ensure it is a strong recording. It is very good at limiting pops and other sounds though. It is a solid mic but for the money I expected a little more out of it"
5,Great for the price!!!!!!,My brother ordered this and he loved the quality! he Has bought a couple microphones for the same price but none have worked as well as this one.
4,Great microphone for voice overs and Skype!,"Blue Microphones have always amazed me with their great microphones and awesome audio quality - and the snowball microphone delivers great sound. I do voice overs for my YouTube videos and my voice comes out clear and crisp. I also get great feedback when I talk to my friends on Skype as well. I didn't like how it didn't come with directions on how to setup the stand since I had no idea so I had to figure out myself, but it isn't too difficult. Overall, it's a great microphone for doing voice overs, great if you want to record yourself singing, etc."
4,Better for podcasting,"I'm using this to pick up ambient noises in an auditorium, works pretty well, but it would be much better for podcasting or straight forward vocal recording."
4,great microphone,"The microphone worked the first time I plugged it in, no problems. I then took it on the road with me, and it didn't work. I reset my PRAM, twiddled with a dozen different settings, etc. but to no avail. Then I found that I had plugged-in the cord upside down on the back of the mic (I was doing it in very little light). It was confusing because it was such a good fit, and the mic's light was blinking on and off. You would think that the light wouldn't come on at all. Anyway, after the user error... great mic. However, I think they should redesign it so you can't make such a silly mistake easily."
4,Performs as expected,"I selected the Blue Snowball after reading several reviews, both pros and cons. It works great for recording music performed on a piano and for voice narration. I am using it with Audacity loaded on a laptop, and find that the combination produces a decent recording. Obviously, it doesn't match the quality of a recording studio. Being able to switch from cartoid to ambient sound is a nice feature. Overall it is working as expected, and I'm happy with it."
5,this is the best one yet,Hey guys this i the best mic i have ever had i first started with a laptop mic for recording commentaries for my channel and it sound like crap . then about a montha later i purchased this one and it sounds fantastic the 3 modes are great for many uses.I would highly recommend this over the AT2020 and the Blue Yeti .this i the best one out there cya bye[...]
2,Be careful.,"I bought this for podcast use on a Vista computer. The cord they sent along did not work, which according to further research, turns out to be quite a problem.If you buy it, the sound is lower than other condenser microphones, but give it an hour or two before you give up. The price isn't terrible, but then again, we shouldn't have to deal with crappy USB cables.."
5,Good budget mic,"This mic is excellent for people with a budget. For the price, the snowball is excellent. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it makes you sound cheap either. Put a popfilter on and your set to record."
5,Really good mic - but BIG,"Very high sound quality and really have nothing bad to say. It is big, however. With a good pitching arm, you could likely knock out a deer with this thing."
5,Freaking Love it!,Was finally nice to get a Quality Microphone the one thing i wish the microphone had was a built-in 3.5 Audio jack to plug a headset in but maybe that would be kinda dumb.The good thing is this microphone is made really nice i was replacing microphone's atleast once a month I do videos for youtube and this will be great! I've heard nothing but good about this Microphone and it was only the truth.I highly recommend you buy this if your into Podcast and going videos for Youtube.Downfall is the mic picks up EVERYTHING! if your in a small room with a TV behind you its going to pick that up you will need a quite room since the microphone grabs stuff it hears but thats the good thing you could be around 4-5 feet away this microphone will pick up your voice.
5,My Niece Is So Happy With This,"I bought this for my niece who makes YouTube videos of her playing her guitar. It is unreal how much the sound quality of her videos has improves since she started using this mic. I'm sure there are better microphones out there, but you cannot beat this price. I knew listening to Hank Green (of the Vlogbrothers) was the right choice!"
5,Just what I needed,"I have been looking for a good condenser microphone that I could use to record music and such for a long time. I went to different music stores only to be told that I would have to spend at least $200 to be able to record good audio. I then finally found the blue snowball online, looked at some reviews, and then bought the microphone. I found it to be exactly what I was looking for. A good quality microphone that fit within my tight budget."
5,It's nice to hear what is going on,I just wanted to talk to my mother on the internet. It seemed simple enough. I bought her a fairly large screen all in one computer and we would occasionally video conference but she lives in New Mexico and I in Brazil. The telephone has sent clear conversations around the world for a century or more but with video there is the added smile and expression. So I called but the microphone in Mom's all in one computer muddied her voice so badly I couldn't hear her clearly.The solution was an easy to use multi-patern usb microphone. This snowball in brushed aluminum really sound clear and rich giving a full spectrum of vocal sounds. Now I can clearly hear all of the news from far away. This is a quality product that you could use to record live music or just upgrade the sound on your computer or laptop. I like the way it looks too.
2,"Great sound, great price, not compatible with iMac","This mic is sold in Apple retail stores. But it doesn't work with the iMac, and I can't figure out why. With my Mac laptop, it's great. With my desktop, not compatible at all.What gives, Blue?"
1,bah not work the 68 bucks,I ordered one of these and it worked ok for about a month; now my computer 'won't recognize' the darn thing... What a waste.
3,Extremely hard to install on Windows 7,"It's not a simple ""plug-in and voila"" microphone as it's advertised, at least for Windows 7 anyways. It took me 3 days with so many different combinations of trial-and-error for me to get it to work. But now, it's working great."
2,Not great,"If all you have is a headset or a built in computer mic, sure the snowball is a big upgrade, but as a podcast producer I cannot stand this microphone. One of my co host uses this mic and no matter what he does to his surrounding environment I am always having to clean up his background noise in post.I suggest getting the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone if you want absolutely clean audio for podcasting. You won't have to do any editing to the vocal track. Just drop the track in and it's good to go."
4,Great Microphone After Kinks Worked Out,"My organization purchased the Blue Snowball to conduct a educational webinar series. The microphone is easy to use and has good sound quality. An important thing to note is the microphone needs RAM and a fast processor to work ideally. Initially, we used a mediocre computer and had mixed results. In the testing phase with the Snowball, one user with a laptop had their speakers on max to hear me just below normal speaking volume. After switching to a computer with a lot of RAM and processing speed, this problem was alleviated. Another great feature of this microphone is the ability to change channels and frequency. Buried in its settings you can adjust the microphone from the default 1 channel, 44,000 Hz to 2 channels, 48,000 HZ. Overall, it is a decent condenser microphone for the price."
1,Beware: Amazon may be selling old stock,"I spent over an hour trying to get my blue snowball microphone to install on a Windows 7 enterprise machine. Blue Mic's website indicates that devices manufactured before 2007 are not compatible with Vista and newer operating systems. I don't know if my mic was manufactured before 2007 because the device does not have a serial number stamped on it. [According to Blue Mic's technical support, the serial number should be on a sticker on the unit; my unit had no such sticker].The tech support person I spoke to at Blue Mic indicated that its possible that Amazon is selling really old units. Amazon's customer service indicated that there is no way to guarantee that a replacement unit won't be of the same vintage. Accordingly, I sent mine back for a full refund. It's a shame, because I bet it would be an awesome mic if it actually worked."
2,Fatal Flaw,"I'm using my Snowball under Windows 7. The unit is a new unit so it should have the ""high gain"" firmware update already installed (I can't be sure; the company says it isn't needed on models after a certain serial number but I can't find a serial number *anywhere* on this mic or the box)Anyway, the problem, as others have mentioned, is that the mic's gain is just too little. To record voice, you have to have all your software input levels at 100% AND have the mic about 2 inches from your mouth. Then on playback, you will need strong speakers as well. If you can't get the mic close to your mouth, or you are trying to record a room of people, forget it.I've sent an email to customer service, but no response.This *could have been* a great product-- what were they thinking??"
4,No concerns to voice...,"The Snowball microphone is a great input device for those interested in creating podcasts who wish to use a mike with more capabilities than simply a smaller, USB-type, hand-held unit. The ""stand"" for the Snowball is rather poorly designed, however... very rickety and the legs do not spread enough for true stabilization. Best utilization of the Snowball is to place on a true microphone stand and then place near your computer for voice-overs. The pricing is attractive, the design is attractive, and the results are more than attractive. Great product for pod'ers and vod'ers..."
2,Recording volume too low,"I really wanted to like this mic and everyone all over the net seemed to love. It sounds great, the options are nice, and it's really cute, but the recording volume is unacceptably low. I have the levels on windows 7 maxed, and there aren't any other drivers to help it. I have hold it two inches from my face, it's too heavy/bulky to do that comfortably, and not terribly attractive to be webcasting with your head behind this giant ball."
5,Great Microphone,Got this mic for a podcast. Works great and is easy to use. Clear audio. Great sound. Great for online use. Great mic.
4,Did what it was asked!,"As an actor and vo guy, I was very please with the sound quality this portable (while on vacation)) mic did!. Not only was I able to record auditions but I booked a jod while in Florida. I plugged it to my laptop turned on Garage Band app and presto. I recorded, played back, edited, and sent off my MP3 vo's. I had never done that before. In fact when I would go on vacations I always new that I was missing jobs. This time because of the Blue Microphone Snowball, I was not only able to record and send my auditions but the job I booked practically paid for the whole vacation. Mind you it's not a Neumann U87 which I use in my studio, however it's better than any portable mic I ever tried. In fact that's why I never used one before but a fellow VO friend said, ""you got try the Snow Ball"" Well he was right. I would definitely recommed this mic!"
5,The best mic for podcasting and recording songs,"I'm a podcaster and vocal artist who has purchased a lot of mics in a lot of price ranges...I now have 4 snowballs and have sold off the rest. They're amazingly simple (plug and play!) and have excellent sound. HIGHLY recommend. Plus, they look cool. :)"
4,Overal fairly satisfied,Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase. It does a great job of recording but I do have some issues with volume. It worked tremendouly well at the beginning but I have lost some volume recently and haven't been able to ascertain how to fix that. There are three settings and the #1 setting originally was great and #2 was very soft. # 1 is now too soft and I've switched to setting 3. Hopefully I will be able to find out and fix this problem.
4,'Own nothing that is neither useful nor beautiful.',"The Blue Snowball is both a great microphone and a thing of beauty. This thing records with amazing quality. It seems to lend a low and mellow tone to my spoken voice that others have commented on favorably.I bought it for podcasting/narrating and recording myself playing guitar and singing. For the money, I don't see how I could have picked a better microphone. I also picked up the Ringer Universal Shockmount, and the combination works wonderfully.Aside from the great performance, this thing looks like a prop from the movie Metropolis. It's got a uber-cool 1930's look on my desk. As great an office ornament as functional tool."
5,Love this for desktop recording,"Using this mic for voice overs and screen recording and I'm very impressed. The sound quality is very good and I haven't had any compatibility issue. Fair warning, the cord can be plugged into the mic upside down (no idea why it fits!). If you are having issues, check that first."
3,Microphone itself works great. USB cable failed though.,"The microphone works great! I would have given 4 or 5 stars but when the USB cable failed our options were to return everything or go out and get another USB cable. We needed it to complete an audition, so no options. Just thought the quality control on the cable would have been as good as the product itself."
5,Perfect!!,"Exactly what I needed!! Any one who does anything on a computer involving sound and recording will be very happy for these, especially at the price!"
3,Very good Mic for the money but setting 3 was broken.,The snowball mic is a very good mic but when I switched it to the third setting it produced no sound. It would cost more to send it back then it would if I bought a new one because I live in New Zealand.
5,Great mic. Got it at a great price,"Snagged one of these on a Cyber Monday deal for $43 and WOW, I gotta say, it's a great microphone and even better at that price.Build quality is top notch from what I can see externally. I assume the internals follow suit.Plug and play. Audacity easily recognizes it.Sounds GREAT. A huge step up from the headset I was using.Only thing you might want is a pop-filter."
4,Great mic,"Blue mic is a great microphone but it's meant for close up use. I intended to use it as a mic to use for videos but I don't want to put my mouth directly over the mic itself. To get the best out of it, you really have to use it up close."
3,"It's Okay, Could Be Better",I was setting my standers way to high for this microphone its good and has nice sound quillity but not able to work ever where you would like but its a great [ skype or talking ] microphone
5,VERY IMPRESSIVE!,"I recorded an entire audiobook on my laptop @ studio quality with the Blue Snowball. I was skeptical at first but it blew me away! I also use it to record my podcast each week. I highly recommend! Hear some of its quality @ www,mattpotratz.com"
5,Does the trick + MORE!,I did enjoy the ease at which it was used. It did not work as well as I would have hoped for covering a large area but that was probably my fault for not doing as much research as I normally do. Solid for personal use for chat like skype or online games.EDIT: After more and more use I am thoroughly impressed in the quality by this little mic. The sound quality is fantastic once you understand how to use it. The mic is solid and the stand it comes with sweetens the deal. I'm happy I bought this and it's a great way to podcast.
1,"Extremely low volume, not the best for the money.","Though yes, the quality is not bad for a microphone at this price, the awful help at blue and the extremely low volume make this useless to me. I now have to return it."
1,unreliable,"This microphone does give great sound...when it works.I am very frustrated...it just stops working for no reason at all. I have windows xp and I don't know why it works at times, but not at other times. Wasting a lot of my time"
1,not as advertised,"Not plug and play. Just read reviews. Would be good, i guess, if it worked.Too many problems. Obvious manufacturing problems and poor support. Where's windows 8 drivers? Still problems with windows 7? Another reason to buy American made."
5,Awesome!,"Love this microphone. The sound it nice and crisp. It picks up everything, but I bought the microphone pop filter which solves the problem. It's not the microphone's fault; it was made that way. I would recommend this to my friends especially if they like to make youtube videos, which is the reasn I bought this."
4,Sweet mic.,"I like this mic alot. It clear as a bell when I use it with my Mac Mini or my 17"" MacBook Pro and GarageBand. Very sturdy base. I like that it doesn't need its own power supply. Don't hesitate for a second to pick up this the Snowball. 4 stars instead of 5 b/c its a bit bulkier than I would've liked."
2,Snowball by Blue Microphones,The Snowball microphone is cute and stylish but has poor quality vocal recording sound in the playback. The second level is noisy with background static and the other two levels are noisier. The Bundle doesn't include the ringer; only the stand. You must purchase the ringer separately. You need the ringer for shock absorption. the Snowball is a little heavy and may tip over in the stand. I have had much better tone quality from much less expensive microphones. I was disappointed. Blue Microphones does not allow merchants to provide product coverage or extended warranties for the Snowball Microphone.
2,AMAZON FAILS HERE,"Well, because Amazon lacks in keeping up with their products and keeping them current, I spent $63 on a microphone I'm unable to use in modern times. The version they sent me is not compatible with the current operating systems Windows 7 or Vista because it's an older model.I know these are great microphones so it's disappointing that my time was wasted. Potential buyers, buy from the manufacturer to get the latest microphone for your needs."
2,Great while it lasted.,"I'm not sure what has happened to my Snowball microphone, but I do not like it.I received this for christmas, and it worked amazingly well for about a month before it just stopped responding. I don't know if it was a windows update or something else that happened, but every time I plug the snowball into ANY computer, windows tells me ""USB device not recognized"". Support from their website is kind of slow and they do not offer ANY drivers for download (which would, usually, fix this kind of problem in a heartbeat)."
4,Just Fine!,"Are you a high-tech audiophile? Do you love lots of really expensive equipment that isolates and distills the human voice into a precise, rich, full, like-you-are-there tone or texture?Then why the hell are you buying a $100 microphone shaped like a snowball?This USB mic is just fine for folks who want a better sound than what comes from their on-board laptop mic. It installs in seconds, and bad reviews about ""getting it to work"" must be coming from folks who don't have the sense to A: read the instructions, and B: click on ""System Preferences"" and choose ""Sound"". It's all right there. The mic works. It sounds clear, and it is relatively portable. All in all, it's fine.My ONLY complaint so far is that there is a silver, metallic band that is supposed to be stuck to the equator of the device. It's basically a glorified sticker that hides the seam between the hemispheres. It came off literally when I first set the mic up. Boo hoo. Other than that, it gets the job done."
2,Finicky,I have two of these. One at home and one at work. I've found them to be very finicky. A difference of an inch can change the audio levels a lot and since there is significant lag in the analog to digital conversion it is nearly impossible to monitor the levels while recording oneself. I finally gave up on these and went with a separate mic mixing board and firewire A/D converter. The quality isn't that much better but at least I can listen to myself on the headphones while I record to make sure the levels aren't changing without being .1 second out of sync.
1,Doesn't work with windows 7,It works with windows xp but windows 7 is a no go! Blue snowball has terrible documentation on this problem.
2,Comes with nothing,"The mic performs OK, but be prepared-- the thing comes with just what you see- bare microphone only. No way to support it unless you buy a stand. No usb cord with it (can you say 89 cents?). The manual is filled with clever quotes and puns, but light on useful technical info."
4,I use it to make videos using powerpoint and camtasia,It's a good microphone for the price. I do instructional videos using camtasia and powerpoint. It works well with good quality sound. (don't expect profesional sounding grade but for most internet work you don't need better than this). I do recomend it.
3,USB Not recognized,"Note: I am not an audio junky, I do not know any of the technical aspects to it. This is a problem I had with this mic that may occur to other people, my aim is to save future headache that may occur due to this bug.I kept getting this error ""usb not recognized"" and trust me I've tried every trick in the book to fix it, such as unplugging it, rebooting it, uninstalling it through the device menu, etc. To no avail did any of this fix the problem. I primarily used this mic to record my voice to put over game play videos. The quality was good nothing amazing, but for the price, pretty damn good. It's unfortunate I couldn't fix the USB problem, I want to say it's my motherboard but I purchased a different USB mic the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone and it works perfectly fine, both being ""plug and play"" devices."
2,"Records Well, but Timbre Not Very Good","For the price, I expected better bass tones. It seems not very good on the low end frequencies. Though the sound is clear, just a bit thin."
3,Not what I expected.,I heard this microphone online as a comparison shopping was done. I was looking for several microphones that would be super easy for high school students to use in a lab setting to create podcasts.I'm afraid that this mic has VERY LOW sensitivity and has to be held close to your mouth to hit the radar. Probably a good choice for LOUD groups/music as the quality is very nice - but such a low sensitivity for single or small groups of speakers means the audio file will have to be enhanced a few times to make it audible.
5,"Killer Mic, Killer Vocals",I highly recommend any of the products from Blue Microphone. Those guys got it sussed!
5,High quality for low price. Can't go wrong.,"This microphone is a stationary mic. It is intended as a stationary mic. And it does its job beautifully.I record video commentaries for Youtube, hold livestreams, and require a high quality microphone. The Blue Snowball has become the ""internet standard"" alongside its older brother, the Yeti. If you don't want to spend the money to get a Yeti, get a snowball. Sound quality is great, build quality is great, and the plug-and-play functionality is unparalleled.One small note - after about a year, my USB cable became defective (guess I had moved the mic around too much or too roughly). It still worked, but if I moved the Mic in any way, it would be temporarily disconnected from the computer and the recording would fail. I replaced the USB cable (it's a very standard one, easy to replace) and those problems disappeared. It's still on chuggin.Kyle"
5,"great shoe, great price!","I bought this for a gift for an elderly woman at X-mas. It was a great buy. It was more tan, orange though than the picture."
1,worse than a student film,"Please don't waste your money on this, unless you are interested in learning about really bad amateur film. Hopefully it was good practice for everyone involved so they can do better next time, but this project should not have been released for sale. I wish them the best in future projects, but I also wish I could get my 3.99 back."
2,i must be missing something.....,i'm sorry to say but i had a hard time watching this movie.....i really gave it a try but it just didnt work for me.....the impact was very weak...acting bad......i just didnt get the creative aspect of this movie....i found it hard to believe that the average rating was more than 2 stars....
3,Trimtab23,"I think the only reason have for saying ""I liked this film"" is that I know the author of the novel the film emerged from, and her family. The book is a much better story than the film. The screen version does not stick to the original storyline in the book; else I would have given it 4 stars.Read the book. Wild Geese, by Martha Ostenso. It won a contest sponsored by Dodd, Mead, and Company for the best North American novel in 1925. Written in a mere six weeks."
2,Not His Best Effort,"I have over 16 CDs from the Dr Thompson and really enjoy most of them, HOWEVER, it IS a mixed bag. Some are outstanding and others are somewhat weak. ""Sapphire Skies"" is in the weak category, here's why: 'musicianship' or lack of it. I'm not certain how some of the CDs can be so well done, while others (like this one) can sound so amateur. Different musicians perhaps? The playing on this one is SO bad it's distracting.Instead, I would give really high ratings to some other CDs from Dr. Thompson, for example, I really like the ""delta"" (natural and ambient) music releases, the two ""gamma meditation"" releases get a lot of spins around here, as do the ""healing mind"" CDs. The two ""delta"" sleep disks are wonderful also.""Sapphire Skies"" is just not his best effort."
4,Great collection,"They were not in the spotlight for a long time, but recorded some noticeable club hits like ""Showing Out"" and ""That's the way it is."" The music is pretty simplistic, just like all the dance acts produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman (Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Rick Astley, Big Fun, Sam Fox, and the like). However, it is very happy, danceable and care-free, of high technical quality, and vocals are pretty good. I like the extended versions the most."
1,Beavis & Butthead Production,"This DVD is a completely amateur production. I've seen better high school video productions. The material was not presented in a straightforward manner. There is more footage of Bob & Brett than of the Pro-Tools interface. There is little to no attention paid to detail or accuracy. For example, they show you how to arm the click track for recording as if they were going to record audio to the click track itself. Brett probably says ""So"" and claps his hands about 50 times. I don't know the total for sure because I couldn't stomach the whole DVD. It looked as if they had no script at all. They were kind of just winging it as they went along. It was a very unprofessional and uninformative production overall. Not worth the DVD case it came in."
2,Not so good,This book wasn't very expensive but it wasn't that good either.Book was very thin but large very odd.If you collect jewelry books like me you will already have all the pictures.If you are buying other books at this price it may be worth an add on but dont expect to much.
2,not good,"This was the first pedal i bought and i purchased it about 2 years ago. i play hair metal and some heavy and thrash, and this pedal does not work for me. its a well constructed pedal, very tough, but you just cant get an edgy sound outta it. the only thing ive got it work with is some bad company and ac dc. but if you try to get the metallica sound or a guns n' roses, warrant, ratt, or anything with a heavier set guitar range, it just wont work. bar chords sound terrible on it. so now im going to purchase metal zone pedals. not a good pedal in my opinion."
4,I didn't buy this movie but the review below is foolish!,"Either your one of those white people who want the tape to mention these white boxers or you crazy, Lyne iis not a big puncher, if that was the case he would have knocked out rocky marciano he fought in the worst era in boxing 1949-1955, Max bear, the guy who joe luis dismanled in 3 rounds knocking him down 5 times and taking his bes punch and smiling? COME ON dont go bitchin about this taoe just because u dont know ur boxing. They could have mention Jim jeffriesm, sam lanford, JACK johnson, But shavers wasn't the hardest puncherin the 20th centry ur crazy, its big george foreman, tyson ht harder then shavers, your just another example of a fool who didn't like the tape cuase it prob didn't mention no white fighter learn ur boxing son."
2,Buyer Beware,"When it was difficult to get to the library to view the Uniform Plumbing Code, I used this at home to study for an exam. I was rudely surprised when I got to the libary, compared the references to the code, and found that this guide was riddled with errors. It serves a purpose as it alerts the user to possible code issues, but you must check all references. The codes are expensive but not as expensive as counting on this guide might be."
2,Its helpful,"This has good diagrams, good descriptions, but is very basic. For the money you can find a better source."
5,"CARL, WHERE ARE YOU?!?!?!?!","I have read every book Carl has written and I keep waiting for the next one, the new novel to come out. Carl, I miss you! Please put a new book out for us. No one does it better. Do you hear me, Carl? HURRY please because I'm going through Hiaasen Withdrawal!"
3,Draining,"Unfortunately, this new set of series was almost unwatchable for me. It was overly violent, monotonously gray and bleak. Tommy Murphy had lost all humor and seemingly life-force. Nesbitt does a good job portraying a man with basically nothing to live for, his only driving force being his job, but it is, at times, just too much ugliness in a series that used to be peppered with his humor and wit."
3,rough harsh words nuity not my cup of tea,rough harsh words nuity not my cup of tea. It's life on the seedy side always not we want for entertainment if so we can just take a ride to anywhere USA
4,"Just searching this song called ""peanut butter jelly""","it's a up-beat type of song,..and it's really by Dj Peanut butter jelly,...but I can't find it so will you please help?"
5,Must Have!!!!,"Every child loves these books! I even read this one to my sons Kindergarden class, I never heard them so quiet!!! It is lovely and geared for kids just learning all about crazy things our bodies do!!!!!"
1,gross,"""Everyone Poops' is a tasteful classic. ""The Holes In Your Nose"" is not. We were given it as a gift, but I put it aside after only one reading, saying my kid could read it to himself once he got old enough, but I didn't have to suffer through reading it aloud ever again. We don't need to read about someone picking his nose and eating it! Disgusting, and not worthy of being promoted alongside 'Everyone Poops', as it so often is."
5,go nose holes!!!,"we totally loved this book. it was so honest and refreshing! ESPECIALLY the part where the dude FARTS (and says BRRRROMMMM)!!! the illustrations were delightful. oh, and- HAVE YOU CLEANED YOUR HOLES TODAY? (i have). =) thank you, and enjoy your flight into the land of the NOSEholes. !"
2,A Boring Treatment of an Interesting Body Part,"Another book in the spirit of Everyone Poops, but without the same humor or simplicity. It opens with comparisons of different people's nose holes, and proceeds to animals' nose holes (the dolphin has one on top of its head; seals and hippos can close theirs to go underwater). The content of ""boogers"" is described, and there's an explanation of how the nose and mouth are connected. There's a little experimentation, where children are asked to hold their nose and try to talk, and a bit of non-essential body humor: ""Wed the holes in my dose are sdubbed ub, I candt sbell id eved wed I fart.""Young children are fascinated with the aspects of their body which they are not allowed to talk about, and this book attempts to bring a lighthearted, scientific understanding to this oft-overlooked body part. However, the artwork is below mediocre, the text is unexciting, and there are better books that cover this topic without being boring."
2,Poor formatting in the Kindle version.,"The Kindle version of this book does not respect your current font settings. The font it uses renders poorly in many places often becoming much lighter than the surrounding text. Overall a much poorer reading experience than the physical version of this book. The problem seems to be restricted to this book, other books from the same publisher and author work as expected."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This time, the book is a direct sequel to the one that came before. Lorn is growing in power and ability, both in a military and political sense. His wife's mercantile influence is also increasing, which is definitely helpful to his cause.Because of this, and how their society works, lots of people want to kill him. If you have read some of the other books you will know where this is going, too."
5,LIVE AT PALAIS--GREAT TO SEE IT ON CD,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM IN 79 OR 80 NEW IN THE STORE. THE CONCERT WAS RECORDED IN AUSTRALIA NOV 10,1977. CONCERT HAS AN MORE OF AN ELECTRIC ROCK SOUND THAN THE LIVE AT THE BRITT 92 CONCERT. AL STEWART IS HELPING ON LEAD GUITAR AS HE DID ON THE NEXT STUDIO ALBUM INFINITE RIDER IN 1979. GREAT TO HAVE PALAIS ON CD AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. (IM ONLY 37 MIND YOU). THE CD HAS BONUS TRACKS FROM LATER CONCERTS: GRAND ENNUI AND CAPSULE FROM THE 1981 LIVE AT THE ARMADILLO. ALSO CRIPPLED LION AND LISTEN TO THE BAND FROM THE 1995 GRETSCH CONCERT. DONT LET THIS CD GET AWAY. BUY IT!"
5,Sue,The product was just what I was looking for. I gave it for Christmas Gift and she Loved it. I bought one first and got it and liked it so very much I ordered a second and it arrive in perfect time. Great transaction.
3,Really dumb but kinda funny at times,"Okay, this was done on the very cheap, with non actors, silly writing, and nothing really new in the plot situations. But at least it is some good dumb fun, especially if you rent it cheaply."
3,ok movie,not a very good movie bad acting i thought! no nudy and no good gore wish it was more fun horror
1,I won't be hushed about how bad this movie is,"A man searching for ten years for the killer of his wife and kidnapper of his child, finds him but not in the way he is hoping.The 'mystery' of who or what Mr. Hush is can be guessed within the first eleven minutes into the film and only that long before he doesn't even show up until then 10 minute mark. That's 10 agonizing minutes of nothing happening. The only thing more dreadfully boring then those first ten minutes is the remaining part of the film. For extra masochistic points one could even stay after the credits for even more of this awful film, but I don't think anyone other then me would be that self-loathing as to do something as silly as that."
2,Mr.Hush,the only good part about this two star movie with me and my whole family hated so as i was saying the only good part was EVIL EDDY
5,Great Guitar Blues / Jazz mix,This is a great CD! Guitar work is excellent and 9 out of 10 songs on the CD were aired on The Weather Channel.
5,mystery anthology,"I found this book by accident several years ago, and continue to see it as the most usable and readable of the mystery anthologies I have seen. The authors sense of humor only adds to the enjoyment. Bourgeau's website promised a new addition, but I am still looking for it. Has the deluge of new mystery novels over the past twenty years made the job too difficult?"
3,Bersabal is back,"Interesting DVD , specially because I was formerly assistant of this filipino master.In spite of that some techniques seem weird in their execution ,and some are really funny , when he defends himself with his GSM or flashlight for instance .This DVD is a mix with another DVD distributed in Germany and France ."
3,Nice TV....but that awful smell !!,"I have to second what a previous reviewer said:This TV smells terrible!I have been patient for six months waiting for the smell to fade, but it just keeps on producing that foul odor just as it did the day I bought it.I will be getting rid of this TV ASAP because of it.Apart from the stink, the TV is perfect."
4,"Great product, but prepare your little one...","The tumblers are truly no-spill and the graphics are adorable, but please warn your little ones that the star bubble wand does not blow star-shaped bubbles, but lots of nice little round ones. I had one ticked-off toddler on my hands when he explained to me in frustration that no matter how hard he ""blowed it"", he couldn't make a star! :)"
3,Good for beginers,"I just got the tape today, it is nice for beginers but it is not for me, I was expecting more good explanations on some areas."
4,A Surprising Read,"I attend college at Texas Southern University. My room mate brought this book back to me and asked me to read it. Not really thinking about asking her what kind of book it was, I opened it and started reading and put it down thinking it wasn't going to be a good read. After spending the holidays alone and having nothing to do, I went back to this book and picked it up and started reading it again.To my surprise, this book was very good. It pulled me in since I had nothing to do and no where to go and since I was alone. I found myself six new friends. I also found myself laughing out loud and crying along with them. These six friends made me wish I had six friends or more and our relationship was like theirs. You know how there's always a strong one and a weak one in the bunch, well, I think I possess a little bit of both Queen and Lisa.There are two more books from this author that my roommate has and I am waiting to get to reading those two as well. TSU in da Houz..........."
1,Because there is no zero,"Comparing this book to Hiaasen, Leonard, Dorsey, or Barry is like comparing Shakespeare to comic books. It's a sacrilege. I was suckered into buying it because of all the hype about what a funny Florida crime romp it was. What a terrible disappointment I suffered. While the story sounds promising, the writer has a tendency to go off on tangents that are just plain boring. I really didn't care enough about a chicken carcass being thrown overboard and sinking to the bottom of the ocean to read about it for three pages. Every situation is explained to absolute death, and I found myself yawning endlessly until I finally, joyously, reached the end. I recoiled in horror when I saw a new book by the same author in bookstores. Reading this one was enough to put me off this writer forever, and warn everyone I can reach! I am absolutely stunned that people liked it. Whoever compared this drivel to Hiaasen, Leonard, Dorsey, or Barry should be sued for libel."
3,Excellent Video but Low Frequency Artifacts,"The video from this DVD is outstanding. I wouldn't change anything. The only issue is with fairly continuous low frequency noise. If you have large speakers or a subwoofer, you will hear the noise - very disappointing."
4,Masterful performances of masterworks on a superb organ,"I have little to add to what others have said: a world class performer, playing some of Bach's greatest works on an organ that Bach himself may have played. The organ had recently been restored when this DVD was recorded, so it was in superb condition. The closest experience I've had in this life to heavenly perfection has been listening to certain passages in Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, but some of the organ works on this DVD take me almost as close to heaven.Warning: this DVD may tempt you to spend serious bucks upgrading your speakers!"
1,$299: Are you out of your mind?,You must be crazy! $299! What are you thinking? For one DVD? What planet are you from? Deffinitily not Earth! Woop!
4,This is a survey book...,"A basically a glance at everything from pre-columbian to the present. Obviously, this can be broken down into 1000s of subtopics. It's a good introductory book to the basic aspects of Native American studies.The tone set by Fleming is obviously a native perspective. That's great, as we already have plenty of white perspectives. Regardless, some of the things he says are objectionable, but i highly doubt any of the facts are false. Ironically though, some of the things in this book are claimed false by other books. That's just the nature of this topic.This book is best to be accompanied by other books. It's difficult finding accurate information on this subject though. It's best to stay away from scientific and anthropological books, which can be very inaccurate and biased."
3,Native American book,This was an interesting book but most of the information was generic and not as helpful as I had hoped.
3,a decent companion to (ISC)2's CBK (common body of knowledge) 2007 print,"INTRO:The SSCP exam and certification is a great way to make headways into the IT Security world. The exam requires 1 year of experience and application via (ISC)2's website. This book does not contains the most up to date information, but is a great companion to the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) that (ISC)2 has published more recently (2006).EXAM:This book should cover all the material (7 domains) tested on the exam. It is a prudent measure, to use more than one resource to study for any IT exam. I would also recommend the practice exams offered by (ISC)2.CONCLUSION:If you want to learn about the fascinating world of IT Security, have passed CompTIA's Security+ exam and are looking for a challenge, or do not have the years of work experience to qualify for (ISC)2's CISSP exam, this book is for you. I would also add the yellow book published by (ISC)2 for a complete body of study material."
2,Implausible & beyond the suspension of disbelief,"I took this book to read on the plane enroute to the Big Island of Hawaii.The story is set at a wannabe Mauna Kea resort. The writing was pleasant enough and the Hawaiianna fun; however, the romantic relationships were implausible, ridiculous and downright untoward. I left this book and another one by this author at our resort as I couldn't bear to read another title."
4,A Welcomed Change from Surrounded By Silence...,"I have grown to appreciate each Prefuse 73 album, despite their sometimes extreme difference in sound. After a few full lengths and some single eps, Prefuse 73 has explored both ends of the spectrum, from a more traditional hip-hop sound to a more electronic sound. This collaboration leans much more towards the electronic side, as there aren't guest rappers on this effort. I enjoy this the most out of his works. This just doesn't sound like much else that is out there, including his other works. This ep has enough innovation to keep the listener interested, however it is possible to sit back and enjoy this shorter release without concentrating too hard either."
1,Didn't like it,"I love Bollywood but I have to say this film is not one of my favorites. I understand it did tremendously well at the Box office yet I don't understand why. Perhaps because of the dancing and charm of lead actor, Hrithik Roshan who imo, has yet to prove his ability as an actor. The guy needs to stop making these movies where all he does is dance and pose for the camera. That's pretty much all he does in this movie. It's supposed to be a movie about a super hero yet we don't really get to see that super hero until the very latter parts of the film. The lead actress, Priyanka Chopra is terrible. Just terrible.The love story doesn't work. In fact, nothing works except for the scarce appearances of Rekha who seems to give the only real performance in the film. Give this one a skip unless you're a fan of Hrithik Roshan."
1,NOT SO INFORMATIVE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SUCH LITTLE INFO,I RECEIVED THIS DVD UNDERSTANDING BIPOLAR DISORDER IT WASN'T EVEN A HALF HOUR LONG. DISAPPOINTING JUST THE BASIC THAT ANYONE WHO HAS BIPOLAR OR NEEDS REAL INFO I DONT RECOMMEND THIS DVD 19.95 TOO EXPENSIVE NOT ANY REAL BENIFIT
2,Buy a better product,"I gave this product 2 stars because it is fine for blowing up sports equiptment like basketballs, footballs, etc. However for tires, swimming pools, etc the airflow is just two small. For instance, to blow up a small childs plastic swimming pool takes at least 10 minutes. As you notice, nowhere can you find the airflow amount on this compressor. My advice is to pay more and buy a better product. I wish I had. The positives are, it's cheap...and it's small, so you can keep it stored in your car for emergencies. Oh, almost forgot, the power cord has a label stating that it contains lead. Now that part wouldn't bother me since alot of products have warning labels, but then it says to wash hands after use? Now that part scares me a little."
1,And The Answer Is:Great Pop Answer Songs from 50's & 60's,This Cd is listed wrong. It is the country answer song cd.Check the songs to the country Answer Is and you will see they are the same
5,"Support good rock and roll, And annihilate pop and boy bands","I saw these guys open for the Rollins band (the funny part is that they are the Rollins band without Henry) they blew me away and I bought the Cd as soon as the show was over. This Cd has not left my disc changer for a month and a half.All my freinds have this Cd now and I would suggest it to anyone who likes good rock music. Because the Superior boys are the real thing, so if your into good rock and not limp ... skin Buy this Cd."
3,"Excellent game at first, but deteriorates within days.","This winter, I have been really irritated that I couldn't go fishing because my boat was put away. My parents noticed that too, so they bought me this game with the fishing controller. The first weekend I played it, I was amazed as my craving for fishing went down. That Sunday, I unlocked the 2 secret levels and I caught the 3 secret fish. Next Sunday (today), I unlocked about 250 items and played it for 1 hour this weekend. The game is easily finished, and THERE IS NO FISHING COMPETITION MODE. That trait really makes me angry. In Sega Bass Fishing, the competition mode is really fun and challenging. This game deserves 3 stars because it's not horrible, yet it's not the best. ONLY PURCHASE THIS IF YOU LOVE FISHING. If you don't love fishing, you won't appreciate this game as much as 2 stars."
3,"fun at first ,really slows down","When i first got this game i thought it was fun.After an hour or two,it began to get really boring.This is probibly do to the fact that it is really easy,really really easy.Also it becomes really repetitive."
5,My wife loves it.,My wife just loves this game. She usually hates all video games but seems to like this one. Graphics are great and there are alot more fish to catch than the Bass fishing game. The best thing is it leaves me free to watch football on Sat. and Sun.
5,"The qualities of ""Sega Marine Fishing""",What's hot:-It's a fishing adventure-The minigames are so much fun-Great graphics-Looking at your beautiful customized aquariumWhat's not:-It's a very addictive fishing game-Looking at the aquarium can become an addictionWhat's strange:-Where the heck is the fishing tounament?The awards for:-Best fish-The blue marlin and the hammerhead shark-Best supporting fish-Mako shark-Best stage-The one with the blue whaleThe overall:This is one game that is definitely worth buying
5,"good book, for people with computer science background","good book, for people with computer science background! otherwise a little hard to understand the algorithm."
2,More Interesting Than Useful,"This is one of those academic texts over which programming fetishists salivate. Those of us that program for a living won't find this book very useful. There are some interesting algorithmic niches explored for procedural programmers that one in a million may find useful. But truly Higher Order Perl isn't about functional algorithms, it's about object modelling. For instance, why discuss the primitive concept of callbacks, when Object Oriented Programming is possible?"
5,Excellent,"This book is excellent. Unless you're a programming genius as well as a Perl genius, this book will teach a a lot of cool Perl tricks, and a lot of cool programming techniques which can be applied to all sorts of thorny problems and even implemented in other languages (although, some of the techniques might be a real pain to write in one of the ""real"" programming languages i.e. C/C++/C#/Java).I am much more of a Python programmer and I tend to avoid Perl if I can, but reading this book makes me want to write Perl code again.OK, maybe that feeling doesn't last for long, but it reminds why Python (and Ruby!) owe so much to Perl and the Perl community."
1,don't waste your money,"Bought this for Christmas for my daughter , what a waste. After putting in new batteries a few times it was useless didn't work. Giving the benefit of the doubt sent back for replacement, to which received promptly but unfortunately just sent the replacement back for a refund this time , not wasting my time on this model . Buyer beware on this portable cd player."
5,Don't Waste $$$,"Hmmm spend $50 on Monster cables or $4 on exact same cables with less fancy tubing. I wonder which one I should get. I used these forever when I ran out of HDMI ports, stood up to being plugged and unplugged quite a few times. Recommended because they give you good quality picture and save you money!"
3,The Hughes Brothers,"This is an interesting collection of letters, and memoirs of two brothers that served as pilots during the Great War.There are books of this nature that are much better and many that are worse. Like all publications of this nature, much of the text is rather personal in nature and the 'historical' tidbits must be mined with careful reading.Much of the material in this book deals with the training of American pilots. Relatively little information about combat operations will be found in these pages.If you are a fan of Great War Aviation, this is one of many books you will probably want to read. The casual reader may want to consider other titles."
2,"Not very good, but better than nothing.","This did not meet hopes and expectations of having PRACTICAL GUIDANCE for hatching and hand-feeding parrots.Too many technical details, not enough practical application. Did not tell me anything new that I had not already found on the internet. They need a new edition of this book..."
2,Scratched,"Every DVD I bought skipped, even after I returned it for a replacement. Really stinks. Ended up returning it all together."
3,Some disapointment but Im happy,This is truly an amazing anime but this review is going to be focused on this individual set. I am in fact a little disapointed but its nothing I cant live with. I cant speak for everyone who bought this product because apparently people must have different problems but as for me all of my episodes worked just fine with the exeption of part 2 of episode 4 and all of episode 5. They worked but throughout the entire episode there was freezing and some skipping. The package that contains the disk is not very secure meaning ill open the case and sometimes ill have a disk fall out but like I said nothing I cant live with. It is disapointing that while making this no one really took the time to check all of the bugs but I am still happy with my purchase.
4,Entertaining For The Most Part But Definitely Not For Everyone,"While you'll hear pros and cons for the series ultimately it's a series you'll have to check out either on t.v. or online to make sure it's a series you'll really want to own. The series isn't bad per say but at times it will seem confusing to bordering on the very warped perception, the animation and soundtrack are decent but again something you should verify first before buying to see if it's truly for you also the voice cast for the series were very good both for the subbed and dubbed so really no complaints on that part. For $30.00 dollars the series was a real bargain, but for myself that's probably all I would actually pay for the series if you have to go any higher then $40.00 dollars then hopefully you've seen the series or most of it otherwise you might feel ripped off."
4,Great series,The gurren lagann series was one of the best anime series i have ever watced since soul eater and has an action packed storyline and some humor in the series that makes me want to watch it again and again. This has been a very good series and i would recommend this dvd collection to any anime fan lover or for people who want to watch tv and stuff relating to that.
5,Just who the he!! do you think I am!,"This is great for those who like animation, action, comedy, or just want to have a good time. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good Show, Good Packaging, Poor Encoding","As much as I love this show, the encoding on the DVDs could be a lot better. There are lots of artifacts and noise, not to mention the fact that it's interlaced. Besides that, the colors are wonderful, the menus are nice, and the actual packaging isn't bad at all; it's six discs in a standard-sized DVD case, so it's a little cramped, but it's well made. The physical DVDs also look nice.Overall, it isn't a bad buy if you're into the series. However, if you demand high quality, I'd cross your fingers and hope for a R1 Blu-Ray release with better encoding."
2,"Anime is great, but Bandai's quality is Hot garbage","The anime is a classic, and every and any anime fan should watch this.I gave it such a low review because Bandai's quality is now garbage. If every disc worked It would be a 5 hands down.Hard to beleive that their QC is such hot garbage.I have the same issues as most of the people that are writing reviews for this product. The first disc will only play the first 2 episodes and nothing else. Still watching the other DVD's so don't know if the other discs will fail or not.All in all great anime, but poor product.But we have no other choice but to buy this craptastic DVD set that Bandai put out to own it legally."
2,:(,"Gurren Lagann is one of my favorite shows, the show is great, this review has nothing against the show. However, despite there being no blemishes on the discs, they still freeze and then skip about 2-3 secs about 3 or 4 times per episode. Also, there are random times will the audio cuts out or the video pixelates for no reason. I assume this stems from a problem with the manufacturer, but I feel that it is bad business for amazon to continue selling this without some sort of quality control check, because I've looked at the review and know that there are plenty more who have had similar things happen concerning skipping, no audio, and pixelation."
2,Scratched,"When I originally got the DVD in the mail, I wasn't in much of a hurry to watch Gurren Lagann; I just bought it so I could later watch it with some friends. After about a month I finally ripped of the plastic wrapping and to watch it, but when I reached the 2nd DVD in the set I noticed some skipping. I then decided to check all the DVDs. 2 out of 6 had some major scratches on them, luckily only 1 of the 2 had some major reading issues. At this point it was too late to return so I am stuck with it."
3,"Great series, not so great DVD","I was excited to finally have a copy of my favorite anime series, but unfortunately the first disc was defective. the last two episodes skip constantly. every other DVD in the set was fine and there are no marks on the DVD. I'm going to kick logic to the curb and return it and try one more time for a good copy. for such a pricey set there shouldn't be so many people having issues with it."
5,A really great show,"This is quite possibly my favorite anime series. If you like anime and giant robots, you will love this.I have the limited edition DVDs, but I bought this for my little sister and she loved it."
1,DO NOT BUY! FAULTY PRODUCT. DVDs SKIP AND CRASH,"PLEASE READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING.THIS IS ONE OF MANY REVIEWS THAT WILL TELL YOU THIS DVD SET IS FAULTY.COMPLETE WASTE OF $40 DOLLARS. THANKS AMAZON!!!!ONCE YOU GET TO THE MIDDLE OF THE DISC, AROUND 3RD OR 4TH EPISODE THE DISC STARTS SKIPPING AROUND AND GOING BLANK.DISC SET IS NOT SCRATCHED OR DIRTY. DVD PLAYER (MY PS3) WORKS FINE.THIS IS SIMPLY TERRIBLE PRODUCT WITH LOW QUALITY ASSURANCE!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. BUY A USED COPY FROM A PERSON THAT CAN ASSURE YOU IT WORKS. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON ON THIS ONE"
5,Holy s&*t this will take your breath away,"Hands down, Gurren Laggen is the best mecha anime of all time. The animation is so different compared to most animes, but that's what makes Gurren Laggen so special.The soundtrack of this anime is really part of what makes this so great.I still hated it when Kamina got killed, but I like Simon as well."
3,H P ink cartridge,"Purchased ink cartridge for my HP printer recently. It's a good product, works fine, but runs dry VERY quickly. The cartridges are very expensive and don't last very long, but you must order them OR buy another printer. I am considering that option."
2,Worked for a little,"The cartridge worked for a little bit, but before it even got a chance to run out of ink it failed. I would be weary of buying this product again."
5,INK,This was a great price and cheaper then getting it filled. I usually go and get it filled and they say they can't fill it. I be buying more soon.
3,"compare priced, STL at $33.99","I'm disappointed that it's difficult finding this product, locally. Target nor Walmart carried them but they were at Office Depot at a comparable price with Amazon.I use these cartridges in an HP Photosmart C-3150. They work fine for color copies but for photos they're just ""okay."" The colors seem a little washed out even when using new cartridges. The printer and inks are meant for printing photos; I expected more vibrancy."
1,Rip Off,"I only got one of the inks when they said it was Black and Color. Liars, It was $6 anyway so I wasn't that upset."
1,computer ink,"I was hoping to save some money buying ink over the internet, but with shipping I think I would have been better off going to OFFICE MAX. The ink was fine."
3,Will Purchase Again,"These are expensive, but a necessity...neither ink seems to last very long, but, I've tried generic brands and they are worse. When I'm ready to replace this printer, I plan to thoroughly research to find one that uses less expensive, longer-lasting ink, if such a thing exists."
2,Packaging can be misleading,"Prints OK when it works. 95% of them work. But the blue and white air tight bags that HP seals the ink cartridges in DON'T have expiration dates. If the expiration date printed on the cartridge is past, and the cartridge doesn't work, then HP won't guarantee the cartridge and you are out $24. Thing is, you won't know this until you open the bag which says, from HP, ""Keep sealed until ready for use."" Although the box containing the bags has a date, HP leaves it up to the user to transfer those dates to the individual ""Keep sealed.."" bags. These cartridges do indeed ""expire"" so don't store too many in your drawer."
1,Scam,Both of the cartridges I received are awful! The black ran out in about 10 copies and the color isn't even compatible with my printer! How does that work! Do not buy from this company! Best bet is to go to Office Max instead. Zero stars!!!
4,VIEW THE BILL,WHEN I RECEIVE MY BILL I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE PURCHASES ARE FOR. YOU HAVE NO DATE OF PURCHASE OR THE SERVICE PROVIDED. MOST BILL INCLUDE THE DATE & FROM WHOM THE PURCHASE WAS MADE. I WILL USE THE CARD LESS BECAUSE OF THIS POOR BILLING PROCEDURE. THANK YOU
2,Price???,"Not sure, about the 29 dollar price in the previous review, I was at the store today and it was $54."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Admittedly, I had low expectations when I bought one of these for a recent trip to the Virgin Islands. I didn't believe that a disposable camera loaded with consumer-grade film would return anything better than barely acceptable pictures. I guess I was wrong. Not only were the underwater shots crisp and bright, but even the out-of-water pictures look like they came from a much more expensive camera. I have a few complaints about the film advancer sticking periodically and the lens being too sensitive to suntan lotion (this was a beach after all), but overall I was quite pleased."
4,"Good for those ""save the good camera"" situations",We used these cameras on the beaches and in the ocean while in Hawaii. The picture quality was as good as any permanent camera I own. The only draw back is it has no flash which would have been helpful in a few situations. But you just have to plan around this one fault.
1,"Photos come out cloudy, dark, and noisy","I took this on my Western Caribbean cruise vacation. The water was beautiful, bright blue, clear with tons of beautiful fish and coral, and the weather was sunny. Some photos I took were at the surface or above surface, others were 15 feet under. The camera held up well and never broke, cracked, or leaked so that's why I gave it 1 star. The photos came out soooo bad though. They were gray and desaturated, noisy and blurry or just cloudy. Thank god for iPhoto and it's quick editing options or these wouldn't even be worth keeping because they were so bad! Because of iPhoto, I can at least share a few on Facebook but I have nothing good enough to print or use in an album. Not a single photo came out looking decent."
2,Never used,We got this as a back up for our water proof digital camera. the digital camers worked so good we never used these.
3,Alien,"Readers will be pleased with this book if they are interested with the design of the Alien film not so much the theme of the film or Giger's art. The book is set up in pseudo biographical form that records the chain of events that led up to the production of the Alien film, through the eyes of Giger. While it does contain many of Giger's paintings they are not the center of the book rather than a means of describing film design and offering a contrast between Giger's vision and the outcome of the film. C.J."
4,Great Book!,Book came quickly and was in great condition. The artwork highlighted in this book is phenomenal (as is with all of his work). So excited to have this book back in our collection! This book appeals to art lovers and Sci Fi buffs as well.
4,Really good picture and sound,"I recently replaced my deceased TV and antiquated VCR on the same day (and also acquired my first-ever DVD player), and, as always, I did a fair amount of consumer research before laying out my money. I have no pretensions to a home theater system, nor do I feel the need of a huge screen in my den, so I went with the highly-rated models from CONSUMER'S REPORTS. I've had Sony TVs in the past, so I felt comfortable with its reputation. This TV set up very easily and the menu procedure was pretty intuitive. The flat screen makes for a really nice picture and the sound is quite respectable. It's been about three months now, and everything seems to be working just fine. (The previous reviewer may just have gotten a lemon.)"
5,Great TV!,"I am completely satisfied with this TV..It is greatThe picture is crisp and clear..the colors are vibrant and nice..I did notice a little bit of fuzziness sometimes..but that is my only problemThe sound quality is more than acceptableThe setup was easy and anyone could do it..It comes with a small but efficient sony remoteIt is very easy to change the color,brigtness,hue,sharpness etc. on this tv also if the picture is not exactly perfectOverall a great TV..You can never go wrong with a SONY TV!! I really recommend it"
5,Just right!,I think this TV is great!! I am impressed with the picture every time I watch it and the sound is very good also. It is easy to use and a perfect size fot any living area. I am completely satisfied with this product.
1,"sony is great, if you are blind and deaf","I purchased a Sony KV-24FS100 about 1 year ago. It broke within three months and they covered it through warranty. But then it broke again less than ten months later and they refused to help me out, other than to pay for whatever part is broken. Of course, to get it fixed again, I will have to pay at least 25-35% of the purchase price in labor, and that provides no guarantee that the part won't break again in another ten months. With Sony's useless warranty and unhelpful service, it is evident that they put no faith in their products (and for good reason, given my experience). As a customer who values his money, I have learned to cut my losses and take my business elsewhere. I'll consider myself lucky if I can give this tv away."
1,don't buy SONY TVs...here is why,"I bought a Trinitron 32"" flat screen less than 8 months ago & have had it break on me twice! When the delivery men left the first one, it just didn't work. They replaced it immediately, and the second one was awesome. I loved it. But then the sound started to go dim. Finally I can barely hear anything but static. Their warranty is for a year on parts & only 90 days on labor. To get this TV working that I paid [price] for, I have to pay another hundred or so to get it fixed! IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A YEAR! Customer service did nothing to help me & I am fumed. Paying so much money for what was supposed to be a quality product from a reputable company. My Fisher & Toshiba Tvs I've had for 10 years & never had a problem! DON'T BUY SONY!!!"
2,AM/PM Editions,"Wish I could agree with the liner notes in that Georges' choice of music brings one to their knees. The only thing that brought me to my knees was the price of the CD for the quality of music that was mixed in the AM Edition. Noise: a boring downbeat a monotinus bass line and noisey synths. I purchased both the AM and PM editions without hesitation because I was so impressed with Outstanding work on "" Awake"". What a mistake, PM is only mediocre at best, so much for Acostanation. The only thing that was Acosted was my wallet"
2,This is not Awake,This is good but if you are looking for Awake style flow/melody/production this is not it. I loved Awake and to be honest I was disappointed in AM and PM. Don't mind his change in direction but thought this double CD was not a progression for him.
2,"Cheese, plain and simple","I wanted to like this disc, and based on the positive reviews posted here I fully expected to. But it's way heavy on the cheesy synth melodies and just too same-samey for my taste. Nothing surprised me, and nothing stuck in my mind after the disc ended."
2,typical pop trance,"Like so many other pop trance albums, George Acosta sticks to this genre at its best."
5,The best Trance cd,"This is the best cd that I ever heard, the mixing is amazing and the music is loaded with intense feelings. I also had the opportunity to feel the performance of George Acosta in a night club in South Beach, I think he is the best!"
5,Best Introductory Oil Painting Video by a truly great artist.,"I have watched SO many art videos in my life - this is the one for beginning students that don't want to paint ""pretty pictures"". Kudos to Mr. Martin - He puts out a cube, a cylinder, a sphere, a torus, etc, and actually explains how light bends around the objects and how artists treat objects. He also covers basic art principles and how to create depth. He was a master of the visionary realism school and was inspired by the great 19th century landscape artist Church.Bill Martin was a serious fine artist with work exhibited in MOMA and equivalent museums. I hope they come out with a regular DVD for this, instead of people having to scrabble for old VHS copies. Give this one a try if you want to learn classic art principle instead of painting flower vases."
3,Slight Hiccup,"I must admit slight disappointment after watching this DVD. Let's start with the plus's: Levine's conducting, staging and chorus efforts are admirable. Hofmann's portrayl of Lohengrin, while coarse in some places, sounds great, Roar as Telramund also sings and acts well. Now the not so good moments: Marton, as much as I admire her vocal prowress, simply sounds too heavy for Elsa. Her acting is also too stifled and contrived. Rysanek as Ortrud, as intensely as her acting is, simply does not have the voice for her part. Her high notes, as secure as she places them, just do not hold much weight as compared with perhaps Waltraud Meier. Marton should have reprised Ortrud from the previous staging and another singer performed Elsa. Otherwise, the supporting roles are well filled. The other DVD version of Lohengrin with Domingo from the VSO also lacks a good Ortrud. Can we not perhaps have Meier's performances released? They must be lurking somewhere................."
2,meh,"This scale seems to be consistantly a few pounds high. Its no big deal if you are just looking to get a general idea, but if you want something accurate, you'll have to spend more $$."
1,Poor product - 3 M worth the cost,The tape was awful. It would not stick at all. I had to go out and get 3M. the plastic itself is not as clear as 3M. i thought it interesting that they changed their colors to copy 3M colors.
4,Good For a Few Laughs,"I bought this along with a few other similar spy comedy titles, and this was the second best title behind the first OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies. I enjoyed this, but after Nest of Spies this wasn't quite as funny. It's a more polished movie in many ways, reflecting the advances in filmmaking at the time that the director and crew ably imitate in the modern era, but it just didn't tickle my funnybone quite the same way. Still, this is a quality title, and one I reccomend with one caveat; buy and watch the first adventure of OSS 117, then if you enjoy that movie come back and buy this one."
2,Uninspired Sequel to OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies,"The thought behind the first spy spoof featuring OSS 117 was that France's imperialist ambitions in the Mid-East were guided by clueless bureaucrats and their agents who never bothered to learn about the cultures they were controlling. And it worked! But the sequel is absolutely meaningless.Our super-spy is sent to Brazil to track down a former SS Nazi who is selling a list of French Nazi collaborators. The mission is to ""deliver ransom money"" to the Nazi. Right from the start, it is clear who is ""on the list."" When OSS 117 goes to Rio, he meets some Israeli Mossad agents who want to capture the Nazi and put him on trial in Israel...and have no interest in thelist of dirty French bureaucrats.The plot is thin...the acting even thinner. This is one French spoof that you should avoid. A much better French film making fun of 1960's espionage is ""The Tall Blonde Man with One Black Shoe""."
5,"Technical, musical and lyrical KNOCKOUT","This CD, simply put, is a MUST BUY! I have followed THRICE since the beginning and have owned this CD for over a year. I haven't stopped listening to it. It definitely satisfies. THRICE puts the core in hardcore. Each song bleeds passion and each song cuts right to the soul. Everything about this album leaves me speechless. Still waiting for the next one."
3,Hasn't Aged Well,This is a pretty good debut. It certainly shows the promise the band had (and would eventually deliver on). But there aren't an overwhelming amount of amazing songs here. And it sounds more dated every year. Loved it when it was initially released. I just can't get into it the way I used to. Perhaps I've just been spoiled by everything they've done since its release. To each their own. Definitely give it a chance.
5,strong cd,This is is by far my favorite CD. It is a combination of passionate lyrics and techinicle sound that makes an extremely strong CD. Buy this CD you will not be dissipointed.
5,Quite Good,"I first heard this song off hopeless' new comp, ""2001: a punk oddity"" I was very impressed. Their blend of hardcore and melodic punk caught my ear instantaneously. I picked up this CD and continued to enjoy the rest of the songs on it. It is good all the way through. A good buy, a very good buy."
4,Old soul never dies,"It is a good thing that all those old Al Green Hi albums are still available at a very decent price. They are still liked very much, also among the youngsters. Recommended.Regards,Jan Daniels"
3,10 minutes solutions dance your body thin,I didn't really like it it was way to hard and to fast couldnt keep up with her didn't explain the moves
5,I went from 200lbs to 175lbs in two months!,"I honestly lost all of this weight, I just worked out as much as I could so about three to four days a week at 1/2 hour per day. I made sure to eat healthier and I dropped from April of 2011 to June 2011 I went from 200lbs to 175lbsMy measurements were even more amazing, I had about Bust Waist and Hips were in the 40"" range and now I amBust: 34Waist: 32Hips: 39Yes my hips are a problem but I just cant seem to get them down.. IF you want an easy workout and want to drop fast then do this!!"
2,Silly,"So far I'm loving 10 Minute Solutions. Quick, easy workouts that allow you to customize your own fitness. I was excited for Dance Your Body Thin, as I LOVE to dance and HATE to exercise. Boy, was I disappointed. The instructor is adorable and high energy, but the moves are ridiculous. I felt so silly that I couldn't even finish half the moves without busting out laughing. Not for me. I'll stick with Jennifer Galardi for my dance workouts."
3,Enjoyable and Light Reading,"Monte Irvin provides us with his experiences of playing in the Negro Leagues prior to joining the New York Giants. The part I enjoyed best was his relating his experience of playing with the Giants since I was a kid at that time. He seems to feel that Rickey's choice of Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier was the wrong choice that worked out well. Irvin feels he could have been the chosen player and handled it better due to his more noncombative nature. He also provides us with his opinions on present day baseball related matters. He liked Bowie Kuhn as a commissioner, but feels he erred in not being present at Aaron's record breaking home run. Irvin, as Kuhn's aid, substituted for him. He doesn't feel Pete Rose should be elected to the Hall of Fame due to his gambling. Irvin blows his own horn a few times in the book, but I found it to be enjoyable, but certainly not a classic."
2,Northwoods Mysteries - Lite,"The previous reviewers have already told you more than enough of the plot - lite as it is - in this newest visit with Qwill and his crime-solving cats in Moose County, ""400 miles north of everywhere."" This Cat has gone Up the Creek - without the proverbial paddle. I agree with those grousing that these cozy ""Cat-Who"" capers are recently becoming less. Less characterization. Less story. Less plot. Less mystery. Nonetheless, clues suggest that readers will return next time. (I'll borrow a copy from the library.) What is Polly up to? And who is Walter? At least the squirrels were entertaining."
2,What happened to the rest of the story,"I always look forward to the ""Cat Book"", but I was very disappointed, as it rambled and didn't tie up any of the loose ends. Is the author still writing, or is she having someone else write thses books. Who was Walter, how did Polly hurt her ankle, who was Danny's folks, who really was behind the murders, etc. the list goes on and on."
2,Ho-Hum,"The newest Cat Who book has its charming moments, but just like the last few books, it's mostly about the old days of Moose County and very little about a mystery. The mystery in Cat Up the Creek is secondary and feels rushed. I keep hoping the author will write these books as she did the earlier ones, in which Qwill and the cats dominated the stories and there was no Polly. The Cat Who Saw Red is one of my favorites; also the Cat Who Played Post Office where Qwill got into an accident while riding his bicycle. And how about The Cat Who Lived High, an interesting departure for Qwill and the cats into the world of a rundown hotel. Ah, those were the days - and the books - that made the Cat Who series so great."
2,Ho Hum,"Having read all the of Cat Who's, I've got to say the only enjoyable sections in this, the 24th, are when Quill and the cats are reading, playing, eating or just simply musing. Agree there is too much filler here and not enough pasties (meat). The plot wanders around and in particular, the Polly and Walter plot went nowhere. Quill and the gang are old friends but they either need a real vacation or maybe a dog to spice things up."
2,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Braun, have all her books, reread them from time to time and have enjoyed them all -- except this one. I felt the characters -- even the returning ones -- were flat, ""Quill"" didn't exhibit his usual witty repartee and the book didn't flow with Braun's normal intelligence. Quill seemed more preoccupied with who he was taking to dinner and what he was eating than the actual mystery. While reading, I wondered if this, in fact, was a draft that was published for whatever reason. If this had been the first book of the series that I had read, I don't think I would have read any of the others.Keep in mind, though, that Braun has set some very high standards for her readers. I shouldn't expect her to hit the mark every time, and yet she has until this book. I admit, she's spoiled me. I'm looking forward to the next one with the hope that she will again be back on top."
2,I've lost a friend,"I've read and listened to all the books in this series, spending many enjoyable (!) hours on the freeway listening to the talking books and forgetting about everyday concerns.Unfortunately, this book is unfulfilling. I missed the mysteries, character development, and plot of the earlier books in which each book was an adventure. It was like visiting old friends. This is no longer the case.I understand Lilian Jackson Braun plans one last book and I only hope that it lives up to the wonderful early stories."
3,"A Very ""Lite"" Comfort Book","Every year I anicipate Ms. Jackson Braun's newest book. Unfortunately, the last few years have not been very satisfying. The Cat Who Went Up The Creek is a mere shadow of the former funfilled glory that is the ""Cat Who"" series. Yes, it is somewhat entertaining--probably because I knew all the characters previously. My cat, Cujo thought there was very little of his favorite character-Koko. In fact, Koko & Yum Yum appear to be almost afterthoughts in this lightweight book.I read a library copy and was glad that I did. I would have been upset if I had actually spent money on this book."
1,"After 24 books, very predictable","I think that my title says it all. These books are cute, but the formula never changes. A stranger (non-Moose County person) is involved in some mysterious dealing that Qwill and the cats must investigate. How boring. Here's some advice for the people that loved it -- find a new author, one with imagination.I wish that the author would find a new formula for her books. But, why bother when this one will end up a New York Times bestseller like all of the rest of her books? I am very glad that I borrowed this book from the library. Don't waste your money on it."
1,What happened?,"I have read all the books in this series; they are my reading ""comfort food"" when I need something warm and cosy. The eccentric population of Moose County are, for the most part, the type of warm and kind people I would like to have in my own life. However, there is very little of that in this book. Most of the regulars are not heard from. The cats are too much like my own rather untalented critters (although I love them dearly, they can't find their dishes without my help, let alone solve mysteries!), and Qwill seems unfocused and not very interested in this mystery, either. It is the only one of these books I haven't re-read, and I can't bring myself to do so.I see that there is to be a new book due out in January. Let's hope that this one will be "" the cat who did something""."
2,"Other ""cat"" books were more enjoyable.","I really didn't know who committed the crime, had to re-read a few chapters. I don't think it came right out and said ""it wasso and so."" Kind of left you hanging."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of Ms. Braun's Cat Who books I always look forward to each new chapter. But The Cat Who Went Up A Creek is a far cry from her usual entertaining fare. After 27 episodes featuring the cats, she has finally hit a wall. Without revealing any of the details of the mystery (and there are only a couple)this book relies too heavily on the local characters and Mr. Q's ability to have dinner with each of them. This book spends more time on social events surrounding Moose County than on even pretending there is a mystery. If this series is going to survive (and I hope it does) Ms. Braun needs to relocate Mr. Q and the cats to a different location, Moose County has become stale."
3,Definitely not what they once were,"This newest book in LJB's series was better that some {robbed a bank}, but certainly not as good as they used to be. I find myself missing a lot of great characters, and I am just glad we did not lose anymore locals. The writing does not feel like Ms Braun and the plot leave much to be desired, but I alway enjoy romping through Pickax. I personally was glad Polly went on vacation even if it means creating a new sister we never heard of. I will continue to read the books no matter what. It's like a trip home for Christmas and not seeing everyone. Its fun to go back, But you wish you could have had a better time."
2,Feeling a little lost...,"I truly have unconditional love for this series but can not help but feel unsatisfied with the last couple of books. Well, actually since ""Stars"" came out. There have been some new characters introduced that go nowhere. Some central old characters are being ignored (Does no one else think that the cute new Inn Manager and Fran Brodie would be perfect for each other?). The mysteries are too predictable. I do not mean to be gruesome, but everyone being knocked off is someone from down below... I had to immediately go re-read an older book just to get a ""Qwill"" fix. What's happened?"
1,There is no mystery here.,"Ms. Brauns' books about Qwill and his cats have been declining in the last several years, and this one confirms my fears -- that she has run out of ideas (there is no mystery, nor is anything remotely pretending to be a mystery resolved), and is published without much editing (she repeats herself in plot points and gets away with ignoring plot twists -- such as when a body is spotted in the water. The police are called and then for several pages it's as if nothing is amiss!) This book is more about travel, history, and only having conversations over meals, cookies, drinks or snacks. Granted, Qwill has always seemed a bit overly prim, even feminine (calling the cat litter box a commode, the vanity regarding his mustache, the obsessive compulsive neatness of his home) and he's getting prissier as he ages. I'm glad I didn't buy this book, and I sure won't recommend it to ANYbody."
4,Simply Delightful!,"I'm afraid that I dont' agree with some of the previous reviewers. I was wondering when I read this 24th book in the series, how Ms. Braun manages to keep each book original and entertaining. It's an easy reading mystery like these books are, but it's purely delightful. In this book Qwilleran is taking a short vacation just a little ways away from his home. Of course his two cats go with him. Koko proceeds to find out everything that's wrong at this idyllic little vacation spot, and predicts murder and mayhem as usual. I was actually sorry to finish the book, because I have caught up in the series, and now must wait for Ms. Braun to write the next one. These books are pure enjoyment!"
5,Creekside capers are up to snuff!,"Can never put the ""Cat Who..."" books down until I'm done. This was a good story with interesting history about Moose County. Missed Qwills daily interaction with Polly but enjoyed the stirrings in Qwill caused by Polly's absence. Thought the plot was easy to follow with many suspects to choose from and enough twists and turns to keep me interseted. Still love the cats. Really enjoy Qwill's friendships with various characters. A quick read and engrossing."
4,The usual is great!,"This Cat Who is the usual story, but oh what fun to read! This whole series is terrific for a ""lay out in the sun read""! Ms. Braun writes a story that is an easy, fun, quick read. If you are interested in just having a good time read the ""Cat Who"" series!"
2,2005 Version is Buggy,"Totally agree with other reviewers regarding the endless process of deframentation...a fully optimized defrag literally takes hours even on my home computer with a 2.8 Ghz processor and 1.0 Gb RAM. The 2005 model's ""Maintenance Wizard"" is buggy in that the routine that searches for and removes invalid registry entries identifies the entries but, at when the wizard is finished, reports that none were found and provides no opportunity to remove them. However, if you run the ""Fix Registry Problems"" as a stand-alone routine, it finds and reports invalid entries and lets you delete them. I've tested this by running the Maintenance Wizard and then immediately running the Fix Registry Problems; Wizard finds nothing but the other finds numerous. Iolo's solution to this problem is to uninstall and reinstall. I did that twice but the problem remains."
2,Most parts work as promised-defrag is in outer space,"This is a collection of useful utilities-Antispam and anti-hack(read firewall) from Kaspersky. Registry cleaner, and other assorted tools all seem to work well except for the defragmenter. I have an 80 GB hardrive partioned into two 40 GB drives. I tried to defrag the system (C:) that was only about 30% full and 7% fragmented according to the windows defrag ultility. 15 hours later the system mechanic optimal defragger was still grinding away- obviously they have something to fix here.In response to Hiro's comments, I understand that an optimal defrag takes longer, but 15 hours is rediculous. I used a competitors product and it did the equivalent of an optimal defrag in 1 1/2 hours."
3,"Not that good, but not bad either","I have been using this for a while now, I did not install the antivirus as I like trend micro's antivirus.How ever I have used the other features and must of them can done by other programs for free.You can get ad-aware and spybot for the adware and spyware scaning.You can also get the registry and optimizer from other free programs. One I used and compaired it to this is a free program called easy cleaner.Now the feature I do like that this program has is the ram opimizer, that does help a lot in speeding up my system. It also has a neat tool bar that shows you how much ram and cpu cycles you are using which I also like. That tool bar also shows network usage which is nice.Now the defrag is the worst for this program. I like it run for a week and it never actually got done, guess that is what I get for a 280 gb hard drive."
1,The AntiVirus is just a trial.,"I bought system mechanics 5 pro. After a week I just started my computer today and a window pop out to let me know that the antivirus was disabled, if I wanted to keep it running I would have to pay a ""small fee"", I click the button and it took me to the Kapersky website where the ""small fee"" was to pay for the whole program again. Nowhere in the website mentions how to ""upgrade"" the software. The window also asks you for the User ID and the Serial Number which I entered becuase I thought I bought the full product, I enter it and it didn't work. This software might be good to clean errors, but don't buy it for the antivirus because this software is misleading, and don't buy for the defragwhich I haven't tried but reading previous reviews kind of gives me an idea."
1,Utter Garbage,"I purchased this software and enetered the requested registration information and serial number. Every time I boot up I again get asked for the information. When I enter it, it (again) thanks me. It's a neverending cycle. There is no phone support from Iolo of any kind. Their help database is of little value. This software is utter garbage and you should not waste your time or money with it. In fact, I will not consider any other products from Iolo because of their complete lack of supprt."
3,A senior citizen's review of System Mechanic 5,"I'm sure this is a fine product and it has speeded up our computer and removed some garbage. It is, however, difficult for me to understand and operate. I cannot find a toll free number for assistance."
4,Hours of FUN!,"The only problem I am finding with system mechanic 5 is that it can take many hours to do a system maintenance. I have been using the SM software since about 97 or 98... I have always loved that it really does well with keeping your system running top notch. I have NEVER had a major problem with it, but the last system maintenance I did on my 250Gb SATA (only about 20 being used) hard drive, it took 24 hours to complete... And let me warn you now! If you stop SM in the middle of a task just because you couldn't wait.... GET READY for problems... You have to let it complete. I crashed about 8 times last night because I had to stop it to use my PC... Well, now that it has run completely over night.... I can type this without any trouble ;)... I do recommend this software; they always have problems in the beginning, but thanks to updates.... They have all been fixed in the past."
3,?,"Dont be fooled. These dont come with the stuffing (no big deal) but they do have a strong odor, so be prepared to let them air out for a few weeks before you use them inside..."
4,Good product but arrived with one bulb broken,"I really like this product, however unfortunately it arrived with one broken bulb. I sent an e-mail to Conair to find out of replacement would be covered under guarantee but to date have had no response. Perhaps Amazon could assist me with this?Alternatively will Amazon replace the bulb?"
1,POOR QUALITY,"Lighting was ok , but not great. Decided to keep it anyhow. After 2 months of using it for 15 minutes a day , a bulb already burned out. I figured not a big deal , so I called Conair Customer Service. They were not helpful at all, I thought they were kind of rude. Their solution was for me to purchase new bulbs. It wasn't the cost, but the principal of the thing. They wanted to charge me for the bulbs. Which I found unacceptable. A 2 month old item should still work properly. I am buying another brand today!"
1,Yellow Lighting,I bought this mirror for my mother for Christmas to replace an older version. She complainted that it had yellow lightbulbs in it and there were less lightbulbs than her previous mirror. She was not happy with it.
5,Great Product,I received the mirror in less than a week and I love it. I find that it has more than enough light and works great for me. I'd definitely buy this again and would purchases from this seller.
3,Conair TM7LX 320 Illumina Make up mirror,"As far as the different types of lighting and the three panel mirrors, these are great. The problem I have with this mirror, is that on my vanity table the back adjustment will not put the mirror's height high enough for me to see my face. I have had to put books under the mirror. I would have preferred the movement of the main mirror to move up and down as apposed to side to side."
5,Tried and true!,"I got this same exact mirror about 5 years ago and when I moved I somehow lost it. I'd been wanting to replace it for about a year but never got around to it. :( so I went to Walmart to buy another one and the ones that they had in stock did not have the folding doors like this one and my old one did. So I ordered it here. I love this mirror, it worked great several years ago and it works great now! at walmart the one without the doors was $28 and here it was only a dollar more with free shipping, so I feel that I got a great deal! Thanks!"
4,Seniors need all the help we can get!!,this three way mirror is just the berries for me. I live in Fl in a small rv and needed something that had it's own light sorce..and by golly....here it is...wonderful!!
1,Waste of money!,"Like other reviewers, I was looking to replace the mirror I wanted the three panels that the old one doesn't have. I've owned since the 70s. The lighting on this mirror is terrible. Since the only problem with my old mirror is that I broke the stand, I've retrieved it and prop it up. After all these years, the old mirror is still bright. I wasted my money."
2,"Orange, insufficient lighting","I have the Jerdon Tri-Fold mirror at home and am very happy with it, but I ordered this Conair mirror to keep at my friend's house so I wouldn't have to lug my Jerdon along every time I visited. I ordered it in a hurry and neglected to read the customer reviews. It looked about the same as the Jerdon, it was a few bucks cheaper, and I remembered my Conair from the 1980s being excellent.Boy, I was colosally disappointed! Every light setting is just a slightly different murkiness of orange, and none of them is anywhere near bright enough. (I prefer the brightest blue-tinted ""Day"" setting on my Jerdon.) I returned the Conair and had to eat $5 in shipping costs. I'm ordering the Jerdon instead. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I slightly prefer the left-to-right spin on the center mirror as compared to the top-to-bottom spin on the Jerdon."
1,Lights out,"This is the second one from Amazon. The first was returned due to a distorted mirror image. This one, the second, was lights out the second time I turned it on. Conair quality control has gone down the tubes. I do not think anyone should buy this mirror."
3,Takes up too much space and swivels the wrong way,"I read the reviews and bought it anyway. It's not enough to know the measurements of the mirror. You also have to understand that the mirror's back brace sticks out substantially. From front to back, it takes up 9.5 inches of counter space. As well, if the angle is not quite right, the main mirror doesn't swivel up to meet your face, it swivels side to side! I also understand reviewers who say the mirror is not bright enough. This would be true if the mirror were your main source of light. I have rearranged the whole bathroom to accomodate for its size, but now there are other issues we have to solve. May have to return it."
5,Great Mirror!,"I used to have one of these back when I was in high school. Recently, I got tired of standing in my bathroom, in the poor lighting, to put on makeup so I set up a vanity in my bedroom and bought myself this mirror. Love the 4 settings although I always start out with the Daytime setting, its the best."
3,Conair 2 sided makeup mirror,I had another mirror that did not have the sides and I really preferred it. There is something about the sides that distort your image in the mirror and the lights. I like this style though as opposed to the new models.
2,Conair Make-up Mirror,"Not enough light in this mirror and the side panels do not stay in place without wedging. Only reason I bought this item is because I couldn't find a better one, like the old Clairol 3-way lighted mirror."
3,"OK mirror, but not exactly what I wanted",This mirror is acceptable. I was looking for a mirror with bright light for make-up application. Even on its brightest setting it isn't quite bright enough for my purposes. I'll probably end up buying another mirror and letting my daughter have this one.
4,pretty good mirror,"The lights aren't as bright as I would have prefered, but there is one setting that will pass as bright enough. Overall, it's a good mirror."
4,conair mirror,This mirror is very useful. I am able to put on my makeup and do my hair and my husband is able to shave and groom his beard and mustache.
2,Very dissappointed,"I purchased this mirror after a Jerdon tri-fold one that I had less than a year quit. But I am not happy with the Conair. The lighting is terrible, very yellow and dim in all settings. The mirror swivels horizontially, not vertically, making adustments not an option. The Jerdon swivels vertically, which makes it easy to adjust while using - tilt it for whatever you are doing. To turn the Conair on and off, the contrlo must be turned. If you use anything but the nearest setting, this is annoying. The Jerdon has an on/off switch, and the setting is a separate control. I seldom change my setting, so for me this is more convenient. Jerdon did immediately replace my mirror when I contacted them, and that is what I am now using. I have always liked Conair products. Don't know what they were thinking with this one."
3,make up mirror from Amazon,Make up mirror from Amazon. My eyesight is not very good and I feel this makeup mirror does not have lighting in right spots to create light at the correct places to see what you want.
2,horrible,"I ordered this because my vintage Clairol true to light mirror finally gave out. As some other reviews said, the lighting on this thing is really bad. The magnification makes me cross eyed and I have to get my face practically on the glass before my skewed vision can clear up and I can see how to do anything. And the lighting! Don't get me started! The first time I went out after applying make up with this thing was down right scary. I'm sending it back. Unfortunately, after doing a lot of research, it seems there is much agreement that the true to light (now discontinued) was and still is the best make up mirror. I will be searching ebay for my replacement."
2,Not for me,"I bought this to replace a Jerdon three panel mirror that had pooped out after less than a year. To be fair, I had my previous Jerdon mirror for about three years, so maybe I just got a dud. Anyway, I decided to try this mirror, and was very disappointed. The lighting is harsh, and none of the settings looks at all natural. The middle mirror swivels from side to side;I prefer the up and down swivel of the Jerdon. I ended up giving this to my daughter and ordering another Jerdon. I would not re-order this product."
1,Total waste of money,"I have had this piece of JUNK appox. one month,it is a total piece of junk,waste of money.Can not see anything as it has a yellow appearing light,the wings are a waste.If I could have given it zero stars I would have.Wish I had not wasted $26.99.Do not recommend this at all."
4,PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT FOR PRICE,Good product. I just wish the lighting was brighter but other than that I love the mirror.
1,Insufficient light,"The lighting on this mirror is insufficient even on the brightest setting. It has four small light bulbs, two blue and two white. The older lighted makeup mirrors used two elongated fluorescent bulbs which provided much brighter light. I thought it was a bargain at 21.99, but then I had to buy a desk lamp to place next to it to supplement the lighting, so it turned out to be no bargain after all. The style, the mirrors, and the magnification are good... but I consider the lighting the most important feature of a lighted make up mirror. So to me, it is a disappointment."
2,Disappointed with purchase....,"I searched in the stores for a make-up mirror like I had back in the 70's. I was looking for a Clairol mirror with the two lighted sides. The closest I could find was this Conair and after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot. It was a total disappointment. Ended up giving it to my 10 year old daughter. I knew going into it that probably the only good setting would be daytime but even that didn't work well. The bulbs are not the flourescent type and therefore do not give you even-brightest that you need at 43 years old! It was way too forgiving and I wanted something that didn't lie! I ended up finding an old Clairol one in by mother's basement. Save your money and look on ebay if you want a good one like the olden days!"
2,Disappointed,I have owned lighted makeup mirrors by Conair. Here are the problems I encountered with this product.1) After using for a short time the product gets hot.2) It is difficult to open the panels that encase the mirror.3) The lighting options offered are quite dim and definitely do not provide adequate light for applying makeup.4) The cord is too short.
1,terrible lighting,"Let's say that I'm a 30-year old woman, with 20/20 vision, and I cannot see anything in this mirror. The lights are non-existent. I'm afraid to put on makeup in this light, because I may very well walk out the door and look like a clown. I am 100% sure that any color I apply under this light will look ridiculous in natural light outside.I'm returning my mirror, and my advice to anyone is - don't buy it in the first place."
1,disappointed,I had a Clairol 3 panel mirror for 15 year and loved it. The lighting on the Conair mirror is not bright enough at ANY setting
2,Unfortunately Disappointed,Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w/4 Light SettingsThis mirror was the bomb when I had it back in the day of my teens - I loved it. I just purchased it and am sadly disappointed by the lighting quality as even though it has several settings it's missing the one you can truly get a nice bright view to put on your makeup. I don't remember the lighting being so dark :( so now I'm shopping for something better without having to redo the lighting in my room. The quality of the product is sturdy and may do better in a highly lit room but not everyone lives in a department store setting lol. Anyway good luck if you choose this product but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a real style light ie like you have in your bathrooms or if you would like to have bright light. It really is odd lighting colors.
2,bad lighting,I bought this so I could see to put makeup on. well even on the brightest setting its almost like being in candle light. The bulbs seem yellow no matter what setting you use sorry to say but this is going back :(
2,came broken,My wife liked the mirror but it came broken when plugged in it will not light up this might not reflect all of the products but this review is for mine and that is how it came.
3,Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror,"This make-up mirror is a good product for the value.It could be brighter, but it it still worth the value."
4,Good but with One Minor Problem!,This GE Slimline VHS Rewinder is good. It is nice to use this to rewind video tapes back to the beginning instead of having to use the VCR and wear out the heads! My only complaint is that some of our old blank media video tapes that are a lot bigger and bulkier than most other VHS video tapes do not fit in the rewinder. Actually they fit but the rewinder door will not close. But all in all a good product.
5,lots of new information about Ravel,"As the dean of Ravel studies, Professor Arbie Orenstein, states on the book cover, this book offers lots of new research and insights into the very famous composer of ""Bolero"" and other works. This volume is an essential companion to Prof. Orenstein's own works. It offers lots of previous unpublished items and facts about Ravel's creative milieu, in addition to the most plausible explanation of the relation between Ravel's life and music."
5,Classic Business Attire,"I was surprised at how many compliments people had for this copper pump. Goes great with tan and brown suits, white and ivory slacks. It isn't too trendy, which I prefer. No extreme pointy toe, no bows or bells, glitter or lace, just good, clean classic professional presentation. Perfect for the working woman."
1,Awful,"Poorly plotted, clunky prose and a tin ear for dialogue. Could not get past page 50, and that was a struggle. The poor editing provides the only comic relief (a character is 58 on one page and 55 two pages later; another is described as a ""loose canon""). I want my money back!!!"
1,Note to self: Rule # 1,"before writing a novel set in Springfield, Illinois, try living in Springfield, or at least talking to people who do. Otherwise, you might find yourself writing dialogue that they would never, ever say, and living lives that one would never, ever live there. The author lives in Britian, and her lack of knowledge about mid-western America makes the entire book ring false. I didn't make it past page 150."
5,Justice is Not Always Blind,"This book begins with a bit of wisdom that says: ""you must watch your back most crefully when someone you trust steps behind you."" And that gives you a pretty good introduction to this novel.Bleedout is told from the standpoint of two characters. The first is Hugh Freyl, a blind lawyer who has just been murdered. The authorities ""know"" who did it, and that's the second main character a young convicted killer who had become Hugh's protege.The third ""character"" in the book is the system: the police, courts, press, Hugh's family, etc. Innocent until proven guilty is not a viable option when you're an ex-con and the victum is high in the social standings.This is not one of the standard formula mysteries where you know the leading character will make justice triumph, it's a free standing book and justice just may not win."
5,"Move over, Janet Evanovich. Jerrilyn Farmer is here!","I happened upon this author by accident when I was drawn to the fun cover of her latest book, DIM SUM DEAD. I loved it, read it in about three hours, and then ran out for more by Farmer. Turns out SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL was her first, and what a hoot! Madeline is catering an over-the-top Hollywood Halloween party when the host gets poisoned. Madeline can't let anyone think it was her food, so she sets out to find the killer among a hilarious crowd of party guests. That's all I'll tell you. Read this book for a truly fun time...and look forward to more from this talented author. I've already got my husband and oldest daughter hooked. (Farmer's also got out IMMACULATE RECEPTION and KILLER WEDDING.) Can't wait for what's next!"
2,NOT SO GOOD !,"well i dont like to critisize, but i feel i must, the material it self was ok, but the quality of the resolution was to me , real cr-ppy, it had its moments of graphical goodness, but over all, CRA-PPY, i dident like it, i gave it away..."
5,Love It,"An Amazing ring, I recieved it on time. The size was smaller but the company Handled it very well"
4,Pretty,I thought that the ring color was pretty. It is not an expensive ring but is nice for the price.
2,"Pretty, But cheaply made.","The rings is very cheap feeling. The ""stone"" feels like and looks it's plastic (I think it really is plastic). I'll wear it but it feels like it is so light and flimsy that it'll break after awhile. Would not recommend this item, But the shipping was super fast."
5,Very pretty ring!!!,"I bought this ring for my young daughter who is 5, she loves the ring and won't take it off. It fits her hand perfectly. Pretty ring...would recommend..."
4,Not Aqua but Blue,"Which is exactly what I was hoping for, so it was okay for me. Having read the other reviews, I got this ring hoping it would be as blue as they said. They were right, and I absolutely love it, but it would be a very good idea for Gem Avenue to change their description."
3,You get what you pay for,Its just ok. The gem stone is plastic and I was disappointed about that. I didn't wear it for long.
4,Silver Celtic Knot Marquise Ring,"The ring is pretty and fits perfectly. Service was quick and professional and I would definitely recommend this ring and this merchant.However, the stone is more blue than aqua, which is a little disappointing since I chose which ring to purchase by stone colour and not by design; the blue is still very pretty, though.The description also doesn't specify that the setting for the stone sits higher (stone is in a raised channel setting) than the celtic knots which may make it easier for the stone to get scratched.All in all, it's a very pretty ring and I would recommend it."
2,not what i expected,seen these guys on tv thought this might be some new stuff but was just the same old material.I was dissapointed
3,"Good information, badly presented","This is an OK book on FEA that should be an excellent book! There is great information in here, but it is not presented in a logical or organised manner. If you want to get the information from this book you have to read it from cover to cover several times. Even if you are familiar with the book it is hard to find the information that you know is in there!It is definitely a book for beginners or perhaps managers who don't directly do FEA. For a practising analyst or engineer it is probably of limited use."
5,Great wealth of information in one source!,This book is a MUST HAVE for design/analysis engineers. I wish I had this book prior to writting my Master's thseis. It would have saved me several all-nighters! Good job Abe and Vince..
2,Great for Managers,"If you are an engineer, skip it and do real work. It is general, basic, and lacks real knowledge. This is not a reference book, nor is it a teaching book. However, if you are an engineering manager overseeing a group conducing FEA analysis, this book will help you. It is full of wonderful insight, such as: ""FEA can help build a better, more robust product"". These blinding flashes of the obvious will keep most real engineers at arm's length. If I had a chance to do it again, I would not purchase this book."
3,Not a great value,"Lots of general statements skimpy on actionable content. The 80/20 rule definitely applies to this book, I wish there was a tersely written 20 page version of this without the autobiography and Sage Advice being sold on kindle for 1.99 or something. This would probably be an ok introduction/inspiration if passive income and lifestyle businesses were new mindsets for you, but I would recommend 4 hour work week over this book for that purpose... it has autobiography and fluff as well but it was more fun to read and went into more detail about actual methods"
2,What I learned from The Intrepid Way,"Create streams of passive income. That's the gist of the book. If you can make more money, you won't need as much money.With regards to some of his anecdotes, he ought to study some history and economics outside of the drivel taught in school.This book may offer inspiration if it is the first book read, but for me it is not and does not. I was not impressed."
1,This book doesn't get the job done!,"I ordered this book with high expectations. To say the least I was disappointed. I did not find one single idea in the book that could be put to use to help with the premise of the book of more free time and to attaining financial independence. I think the author is sincere, but he doesn't get the job done in this book. I hope for him more success in a future book,..... but if you are considering buying this one .....don't. It's not worth the money required to buy -- or the time it takes to read."
5,"A terrific companion to Rich Dad, Poor Dad","If you're tired of working from paycheck to paycheck, if you're fearful about moving out of the security of your job or work situation, if you're searching for a better way to live the life you want, do yourself a favor and devour this book. 'The Intrepid Way' is a brilliant examination of the freedoms we all strive for--financial, personal, and time--and how we can attain each of them in very little time. This is a book of possibilities. You will be inspired, provoked, and moved.Matthew Chan has delivered an insightful, motivating, and unforgettable work."
5,Awesome glue and deal,This is a fantastic deal and this glue drys clear and clean. I make furniture with handtools only in the traditional 1800's Shaker style and this is my choice of glue.
5,Best glue ever !!,"This glue is great, it sets fast. Once glue is dry you can not pull the pieces you have glued apart without breaking it, if you want a good glue this is the one. absolutely love it, oh and it dries clear too.Cindy, Upstate New York"
3,Truly for Siamese cat lovers...,"A collection of 23 short cat stories, at least half of which I'd estimate feature Siamese cats, perhaps because they have such strong personalities. Whether you love Siamese or not, this is a light and pleasant read for any cat lover. I particularly enjoyed the stories by Joyce Stranger and Rudyard Kipling. Three stars only because there are better cat stories out there; some of these were bland, but others were funny and touching."
4,very happy,"This is my 3rd Polar Heart Monitor and I am very happy with it. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 is that when trying to reset the values (Kcal + exercise time) at the end of the week, it is a little tricky.Otherwise, I would give it a 5."
4,Alot of data for a resonable price,I've had my M32 for about a year. I'm into general Cardio-Vascular fitness. I spend between an hour and an hour and a half in the gym 5-6 days a week. I'm 64. This monitor gives me all the data I need to monitor my routine which consists of both Cardio machines and Circuit training. I especially like the Calorie counter and the storage function. I accumilate a weeks worth of data and reset it at the beginning of each week. The monitor has performed flawlessly and I am extremely pleased with it.
5,Polar M32 Heart Rate Monitor Watch,I upgraded from another Polar product and love this one. It's easy to use and saves the workout info. The strap is fairly comfortable and easy to remove. I can check the calorie count and time in target zone while I workout which is useful. Very satisfied.
2,Not a Watch for Men!!,I was really disappointed when I opened the Amazon box - this watch is clearly being marketed to women - images of women working out on the inside and outside of the monitor box - and the watch is small and thinner. This was to be a present for my husband but I had to return it.
2,polar monitor not what it is suppose to be,"the polar manuel is either outdated or talking about a different watch. the settings are very difficult to set as well as bring up onto the small screen. it appears to be made of some cheap give away watch and is so difficult to use that once you complete your Ph.D, you should be able to get to page 9. once at page 9 you will wonder why you got there in the first place. this product is not what is suppose to be, easy to use and user friendly are not what it is."
3,Decent (if short) account of a daring and innovative attack,"This book handles the telling of the operation in a decent manner. I would liked to have seen a bit more depth in all of the areas, especially the attack, where the author seems to lose control of the chronology. There were some great pictures included but never a comprehensive map of the fort in diagram. Other than these personal preferences, I'd rank this book with the two short masterworks ,""Pegasus Bridge"" and ""Band of Brothers""."
2,"After 21day, you'll learn nothing...","After reading this book, I realized I need to study basic Win32API functions. Hmm.. so I can say I learned at least one thing. I didn't expect I could be a Visual C++ expert by this book, but this book barley touches how you can use Wizards... nothing more."
1,Pure garbage!,"This book has so many errors in the code examples it is disgusting. Several times they will show you examples of how to do something interesting within the code they have given you on the CD but do not explain how to do it! To roughly quote the author: ""I know some of you might be wondering why you have to do .... and .... to do this but that isn't important, just use this example so you never have to figure it out for yourself"". If that isn't bad enough in it's self, then the example code doesn't even work! Do not buy this for any reason, there are much better books on the subject."
1,"To do this, move your mouse over the x...","OK, I understand this is a book for beginners, but does anyone who's even CONSIDERING programming in Visual C++ need to be told:1. How to open a file. 2. How to close a window. 3. How to start a program. 4. How to use a mouse...It's hard to learn anything useful when you're busy trying learn how to do these things. You should generally avoid these ""Teach Yourself to be a Complete Idiot for Dummies"" style books, as nobody that writes C++ program is an idiot."
2,MSVC++ ClassWizards for Dummies,"The only thing this book really teaches is how to use the Class Wizards in Visual C++. However, it teaches virtually nothing about MFC or C++ programming, which is really a lot more important anyway. I bought this book intending to move up from DOS-based C programming to Visual C++, but the robotic and repititious click-here, type-this-there, don't-worry-how-it-works approach teaches you very little."
1,"After reading, I felt I had learned almost nothing","I program/analyze by visualizing what is happening and this book was almost useless for me. The 'type this, now see this does that' style was immensely irritating and gave me almost no insight into how the overall structure of windows programming using C++ works.Picked up Mastering C++ and Microsoft Press's Inside Visual C++ and actually learned why I was doing what I was being asked to type, instead of just seeing cool effects. The only thing I did learn was about the visual toolbars for creating the look of the interface."
2,dissapointing to say the least,"This book attempts to solve a problem relating to Visual C++ for Win 95: how do you enable beginners and hobbists to use MFC, an incredibly complex and rich professional development system? The solution presented here involves what I like to call a ""click click duh duh"" approach, in which the reader is given a list of steps to perform, which, when completed, will result in a finished win32 application. Does it work? yes. Is it programming? no. I don't really believe anyone will benefit from reading this. In order to be able to use VC++, a programmer will have to be able to apply his or her knowlegde in a myriad of situations, not just be able to follow a set of written directions. Besides, the writing style, which apparently assumes the reader has the brain of a garden slug, made me want to retch"
5,I agree with the rest of the reviewers...,"I read this book back in Feb. 96, and was an excelent start for visual programming. Now after reading Beginning Visual C++ 4, by Ivor Horton and Programming Windows 95 With MFC, by Jeff Prosise I still think is a great book for beginners. By the way if you are starting to program C++ read all three books!!!"
2,Not very good ...,"This book was ok if you want to be totally clueless on what you are learning, but if you want to really know whats going on, this book is not for you. It teaches you how to type its examples, and let you know as little as possible on what the code means, they just tell you that you don't need to know how it works to use it. I do NOT recommend this book for anyone who wants to know what code he is typing. Also, the code has many errors in it. I had to get tons of outside help to fix the errors"
2,All said and done,"To begin with, I noticed that even before CJ referred to the shaman visualizing the ships on the sea, and mentioned that the anecdote was addressed in the ""What the Bleep"" movie, she had already included another two references also made in said film (p. 36, paragraphs 5 and 6), which predates her book by two years.Second, the text is full of typos. Overall, nothing out of this world."
4,Good how-to book,Lots of helpful information in this book; I recommend it if you want to write or are struggling with your writing.
5,an excellent guide,I found this to be a great step step guide for fiction writing and highly recommend it. The author is clear and to the point and uses many examples. I would also recommend Stephen King's On Writing; the Maui Conference compilation of present's writing guide; and Bob Mayer's Fiction Writer's Toolkit which goes from the original idea through getting published on to the insiders guide to the book business.
5,Awesome,"I have taken a few writing/short story classes and have read many many text books. This book is the most interesting, by far. I highly recommend it."
3,Tried it on Solid Surface,"I was out of options for my solid surface counter tops, so I tried Rejuvenate. It did the best job of anything I tried, there was a beautiful, high gloss and it holds up for weeks with just wiping with wet, soapy sponge. Even a mild bleach solution didn't seem to ruin it. Anything with ammonia such as glass cleaner will kill it instantly however -- cleaning the window above the counter you could see exactly where overspray hit the countertop. The only way to fix it was to give it a light sanding with a scrubby and re-apply. The real down side for me? I'm hooked on the shine, now I have to keep buying the stuff for when it wears off."
1,didn't have much luck,"I also applied this to my dining room table. Unfortunately I am unable to get rid of the streaks, blotches and dull spots. It went on great and looked nice wet but once it dried it looked horrible. I continued to follow the instructions with no improvement in the finish. Now I am wondering how to remove it? I do not recommend this product."
4,Wood Only,"The product is outstanding on the kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities. They were very expensive ten years ago and now they look like new cabinets. I am going to purchase the product again for additional coats. However, I would not recommend the product for Formica counter tops. I applied as directed with negative results. Once the product has dried on the counter tops it's almost impossible to remove. In my experience it's great for wood but not Formica. I used all the product before I could try it on the granite. Will be reordering soon."
5,Amazing,Excellent product for old warn out furniture. Brought back a subtle shine without streaks or film. Use monthly on antique furniture. No product build up. Comes out great every time. Excellent delivery.
1,Not what I expected,I wanted to use this product on my kitchen table. I was not happy with how it worked on my kitchen table. The table does have a polyurethene finish and maybe that is why it didn't work well on it. I have not tried it on any other product yet but I do intend to.
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to using this DVD because it is focused more on yoga as a workout rather than yoga as a spiritual exploit. However, if you have ever done yoga before, you will find this DVD immensely unchallenging. I didn't break a sweat, nor did I even get out of breath. The idea is good - but if you want a workout I suggest finding another DVD."
1,Cheap,"The branding this woman is going for is just ridiculous. I read the book and it sucked. I am not buying the DVD.Sorry go with your ""No Om"" someplace else. What you are doing sucks lady, I don't know what it is but you are not teaching yoga."
3,No OM Zone is OK,The no OM Zone is okay but maybe a little too much for me at my age. I was expecting it to be a little easier.
4,great video,"this is truly a great DVD. It might be geared a bit towards the beginner but then again we can't all be yoga masters. and just for the record I love the title, I think yoga is a phenomenal exercise program without all the chanting and sand skirt wearing whatever that is."
1,sucks,"I had high hopes for this DVD. I read the reviews and purchased it. But it is way too easy - I never even broke a sweat. And Fowler moves way too quickly through all the poses. There is no way I am going to get a stronger core or great arms from this workout, unless I am constantly pausing the DVD and repeating each exercise."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this book, looking for some real insights into chiron. Practical application, real life interpretation. The author tries hard to push the view that chiron should be associated with the 6th house, which is natural, but not belonging or associated with sagittarius, the natural ruler of chiron.She continues to ramble on & on about mythical approches from chiron, but in truth, real practical, to the point information is lacking.I consider it okay, for it has some interesting ideas about the esoteric body, however, it did not help me with my chiron, seeing how the book is old. She could not say in depth anything about my house position of chiron or sign seeing how chiron in pisces is something that has not yet been recorded. It was very dissapointing & when we are looking for real, straight facts about chiron for the first time, this book is a definite hands down.Like other reviews have stated, the book is down right weird and hard to follow."
1,Highway to ESL,"Not a very well-written guide to anyone who might be a novice wishing to help, through church or a volunteer organization, teach ESL. It may be geared more for one experienced in the art of teaching, just not teaching ESL. I found it unhelpful and never used it after reading the first chapter."
4,Planning to Use Right Away,I've found this book easy to navigate and plan to use it right away in my ESL classes. I appreciate this useful book.
2,Not the same deck as used on facade,This is a poor remake of a beautiful old deck. The images are everything when using the Tarot for insight. This deck was a disappointment.
4,great christmas movie,"came accross this on a national TV station. Being somewhat of a ""grinch"" I was surprised how much I liked this film. One of the best christmas films I've seen. Only pity is it isn't available on dvd or PAL VHS. Shame on universal studios! Loved it!"
1,Must Be Santa-(dvd),"For the last 2-3 years, I really have been wanting to get the ""DVD Version"" of Must Be Santa.., with Arnold Pinnock and Dabney Coloman and Deanna and that little African-American Girl. I would like to try to get the DVD Version before December 16th, 2012.., if possible. Thanks!Dave Lane"
1,Must Be Awful!,"I love Christmas movies. I love bad Christmas movies -- those that are so bad that they're good. This movie is neither -- it is just plain awful!I originally ran across this movie flipping through channels one holiday season. It was like the proverbial bad train wreck. The worse it got -- the harder it was to look away. I kept watching -- searching for a sign that it was done tongue-in-cheek. Sadly that did not happen.The acting is stilted. The sets look cheesy.The plot is convoluted. Some people seemed offended at the premise of a less-than-perfect person becoming Santa. I actually appreciated a loser father taking on such an esteemed role. However, the explanations of Santa and elves and North Pole/heaven left me creeped out. This movie is an amalgamation of a half-baked, poorly written script, some morbid views on death, and a bad acid trip."
1,Completely Horrible,"I fell asleep and woke up to this piece of cr*p on the television. Not only was it completely impossible to follow all the tangential story lines, the premise that this man who was a liar and a thief gets ""santa"" mind control powers and then still goes on deceiving and gambling is RIDICULOUS. The kids are like sesame-street wannabes but WORSE. The fact that is has Dabney Coleman in it playing the exact same dufus character that he always plays is just the tip of the xmas iceberg. I hate Tim Allen and would watch The Santa Clause five million more times than this movie. i've only given it one star because i couldn't give it none."
3,A different Fulci...,"...I had never heard of this movie before I saw myself staring at it at the store. As soon as I saw the name ""Fulci"" I was almost sold. I knew being a different kind of film from the usual Fulci gorefests, that this one would not be like those, but I gave it a chance anyway. I was surprised, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. In this movie you can see a different type of Fulci, as there is not gore---yes there is killing but it is only stabbing. I liked the 80's music, it gave the film authenticity for its time. If you appreciate the work of Lucio Fulci give this one a try, it is different from his other films, but not bad by any means. I liked it way better than Anthropaphagus (I know they have nothing in common, but I feel I wasted by money on that stinker). Worth viewing at least once, if you can afford it I would add it to your library of Fulci works."
3,How Ironic,"It's ironic that an era so exciting has inspirered so many dull books written with painstaking accuracy, and finally when an author comes along who can make Napoleon's times come to life he seems to be a fraud and a liar. As with Mr. Williams other book on Waterloo, this one has enough truth in it to pass as history, while written with an ease that keeps you turnning the page. I suggest you read it, you will enjoy it. And then if you are so inclined, wade through the detail of the more authentic works and set yourself straight on the finer details."
3,Tanita HA524W Analog Scale,"First of all, the scale is a little small in my taste. Being a size 12, my feet hang off at both ends of the scale. I also do not like the numbering scheme as it will say 110 then in bold 12, then 130 and so on. But for 6 bucks I guess I cant complain."
2,"He is famous for his short stories, and rightly so","I'm criticizing Carver with the utmost deference, because I hold the man in the highest regard and strive to write like him. I can't say enough good things about his short stories (My favorite is A Small, Good Thing), which manage to say so much with so few pages. His poems, however, are not as good as his short stories. They lack the continuity of his stories, as well as the practiced craft of more experienced poets. The line changes seem awkward, and there is not a consistent theme in each sub-collection. These poems are not meant to be read by poetry afficionados, but by precocious teenagers who need a little encouragement to start writing for themselves. Carver's stories should be required reading for any human being, but if you like to read poems about the same themes, check out Carl Dennis or Tony Hoagland."
5,True life as true literature,"There are a number of good qualities about the poems of Carver. They are written in a simple clear language. The reader can understand them. They are about events and relations between people, and tell little stories. This makes them more interesting than if they were simply about his own isolated feelings. They have strong feelings in them. And they have an appreciation for many of the good things in life, loving others, beauty of literature. They too show at times a world of destitution, suffering , loneliness, broken- downness .A reader often wants on the page greater misery than his own , as a form of consolation. There are elements too in the work alien to me.But on the whole reading these poems gave the feeling of true life as true literature."
3,Understanding Jim,"Okay, I haven't actaually heard everything on this album, but I have heard most of it. The Isle of Wight interview is very well done. Here, you'll hear Jim Morrison give his opinions of Woodstock, Doors merchandize and you'll also hear Joe Cocker in the background. On ""All Day Breakfast"" we hear Jim being followed around L.A. Well this is going on, you'll hear Jim giving his opinions on the sessions for ""Morrison Hotel"" and ""L.A. Woman."" A casual Doors fan may find this bizzare, funny or even boring but hardcore Doors fans (like me) will be rewarded by getting to know a bit about Jim Morrison from the man himself. Myself, I was surprised at how intellegent he can be at times. Also, an interesting bit of trivia, this album was packaged by the guy who did the cover for ""Led Zeppelin III."""
3,Jim Morrison -'The Ultimate Collected Spoken Words:1967-1970' (Ozit),"Never have been much into interview CD's,but this 2-CD/100 minute release is a good one.Features six different interviews,with plenty of the time Jim Morrison giving ridiculously funny answers to questions that he's asked. The two interviews I liked best were his comments on the ""Isle Of Wight Festival,1970"" (15:50)and ""New Orleans...Very Strange"" (35:59). It's apparent that Morrison was on 'something' during these sessions. Well,duh! Strictly for the completists and the spoken word collectors."
3,Wrong reviews for this album,"The foregoing reviews are definitely for the wrong album. This album has nothting to do with Jim Morrison. I believe Amazon has made a big mistake in linking the reviews with this album.The Out of Phase Disc is interesting.(Disc 2) The first disc is fine as well. But I think there's much better chill out compilations out there. However, you can't beat this price for a double cd."
5,Enjoyable and entertaining travels through China,"The author of this book sets out to locate a Chinese arcadia in the mountains of China based on clues in a fourth century poem written by a Chinese poet who was always pretty high on Chinese wine, anyway. So he heads off into China to try to locate this remote community called Peach Blossom Spring. The book is interesting, sometimes very funny, and sometimes hilarious. Although he is not afraid to criticize the Chinese it is clear he has a great love for them as well as quite a thorough knowledge of Chinese history and culture. He spends some time describing his encounters with Chinese women such as ""Miss Pong"" but that is part of the fun of his style.I can highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read and wants to learn about China at the same time."
2,Acosta must be nocturnal,"If you have to choose between AM and PM editions, get the PM edition, it's 10x better. If you have to choose between Awake and the PM edition, get Awake, it's 10x better than that! That shows you how disappointed I am with AM. The intro and Die Blechtrommel (11) are really the only saving graces to this album. While most of the mixes have seamless transitions, his choices leave something to be desired. French Kiss (7) starts out as a decent piece but soon degrades into a lusty 1,000 bpm nightmare.On the Acostanation-o-meter, I would order his albums this way: Awake [heavenly, the best of 2000], PM edition [must buy], Members of X [for fans only], AM edition [pass]."
1,AM/PM Editions,"Wish I could agree with the liner notes in that George's' choice of music brings one to their knees. The only thing that brought me to my knees was the price of each CD for the quality of music that was mixed in the AM/PM Editions. This should have been a 2 CD set. AM amounts to Noise: a boring downbeat a monotonous bass line and noisy synths.PM is only mediocre at best. I purchased both the AM and PM editions without hesitation because I was so impressed with Outstanding work on ""Awake."" What a mistake, so much for Acostanation. The only thing that was Accosted was my wallet."
1,AM/PM Editions,"Wish I could agree with the liner notes - in that - Georges' choice of music brings one to their knees. The only thing that brought me to my knees was the price of each CD for the quality of music that was mixed in the AM/PM Editions. This should have been a 2 CD set. AM amounts to Noise: a boring downbeat a monotonous bass line and noisy synths.PM is only mediocre at best. I purchased both the AM and PM editions without hesitation because I was so impressed with Outstanding work on ""Awake."" What a mistake, so much for Acostanation. The only thing that was Accosted was my wallet."
2,Pretty but useless,"The suede material and Nikon logo look cool but that's as far as it goes. There is minimal padding and no belt loops so you're pretty much stuck with carrying it or having it flop around your neck. There is no room for any accessories (memory cards, filters, etc.) so save your money and get a real case. I ended up with a Lowepro. I'll keep this one but I don't really know why..."
1,Lowepro TopLoad Zoom 1 is a better choice,"No belt loops on the CF-D50? You gotta be kidding me!I just chose the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 for my new D50. It has a shoulder strap, belt loops, handle, top opens toward you instead of away, inside pocket, front pocket and it is just the right size (length and width)for the D50. The depth is a little more than the 18-55 lens needs but just right for the 18-200 zoom, that I plan to get soon, which is 0.9 inch longer.Did I mention that Topload Zoom 1 is a lot less expensive that the CF-D50? AND check out the Topload Zoom Chest Harness that works with it, sold separately. Both are available right here on Amazon.PS: I have been using the Lowepro TLZ Mini (same features but smaller size) with another camera for three years and am very satisfied with it."
4,Overpriced but nice,"I think my title says it all. Although I'm a bit offended about spending this much for a soft case made out of imitation suede, it does fit the camera perfectly and is easy to use. But at least I can walk a little taller around town knowing it says Nikon on it...:-)I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my camera will still fit inside after my new 18-200 vr lens arrives. It will be close."
5,Great fit for Nikon D40/D40X/D60,"This semi-soft case was exactly what I was looking for. It is not a substitute for a camera case/bag. I wanted it for a little extra padding inside my camera bag and as protection from scrapes when carrying my camera around. What's the difference if you carry your camera by it's strap or a camera bag strap? This semi-soft case doesn't supply any additional storage and that's not really its purpose. I have a nice, comfortable to carry camera bag already and this is for the times I don't need/want to carry around extra supplies.This case is listed as a product for the Nikon D50, but it fits my D40X with a 55-200mm lens and a thin UV filter like a glove. That means it could be used for a D40 or D60 also."
5,exactly what i wanted/needed,"i have a samsonite case that i keep the camera and all my accessories in. i needed something not so bulky to cover my camera when i carried it around town. it's a soft case, so there's no protection if you drop it or bump it into something. that's not what this is for. it's just something nice looking to cover it when you aren't using it."
2,Not Worth more than $12,"Its not semi soft. It is very soft. Its like a flimsy cloth covering for your camera. Does not provide much protection. Im returning it. After a similar experience with Nikon's case for coolpix 5700, Ive come to the conclusion that Nikon makes horrible cases."
3,Mary Stuart Masterson fans will love it.,"Sometimes confusing story line, but enjoyable watching. Peter Masterson ( director ) handles it very much like the stage play he also directed. Mary Stuart Masterson gives a strong performance as a very shallow individual, but her devotees will love her no matter how upsetting her character may be. Other good acting helps, but once again, the storyline can be difficult to comprehend. Watch it several times to appreciate it more."
5,Suspicious,"Again another heather graham book. It spooked me because it took place is southern most Florida and it involved alligators, snakes both of which I hate. But oh boy was it fast paceA suspicious murder and a shocking conclusion. A really good read"
4,NOTHING CAN GO WRONG,"A group of teens hold an after hours party at the ""Furniture King"" which consists of mostly couples having sex. Three security robots or killbots malfunction due to a lightning storm. The teens battle the bots for their lives.This is a 1980's classic second tier slasher film which epitomized the genre in many ways. You have big hair actors, a touch of humor, plot continuity issues, cheese, a little nudity, laughable special effects, 80's code of slasher films, and film background goofs. While not on the level of enjoyment of a ""Slumber Party Massacre"" it is certainly a worth while addition to one's 80's slasher collection.F-bombs, sex, nudity (Suzee Slater, Barbara Crampton, dressing room girl, centerfold)"
4,Good Horror Film,I seen it a while back and i just bought the DVD. It's a good 80's horror film about these security robots go crazy and start killing teenagers at a mall. Which they have spend the night it. I'll recommend to anyone.
3,Not the uncut version?,Has anyone in fact seen the full length 81 minute uncut version? I saw it only once on VHS several years ago and I don't believe it has been re-released uncut since.
1,I'm in shock people liked this tripe,"Seriously, you people think this was a good movie?The acting was horrible, the writing stupid (how many times do you encounter full gas cans at a Sporting Goods store) and the direction a joke.Anyone who likes this movie mtust think infomercials are Emmy winning material..."
1,Go shopping! Don't stay home and watch this loser!!!,"Sometimes shopping can cost you an arm and aleg...literally!!! That's because I just finishedwatching ""Chopping Mall""...a film about roboticsecurity in a shopping mall. So what happens when youtry to rob a mall with little robo's wandering aroundthat can chop you to bits? Not much. This filmsucks! The robots run amouk and the film slowly goesdown hill. This one is terrible. Don't even botherto finish reading this review. I'm glad I got thisfree!!! Even then...time is money and I wasted 90minutes on this schlock ^^%&$&!!! In the horrorgenre', this one should be banned and I give it asolid 1 on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest)."
3,Robots Gone Wild,"The Park Plaza shopping mall has a new high tech robot security system. While three robots patrol the mall, the employees of a furniture store have some sort of after hours sex party. Apparently due to a thunderstorm, the robots run amok. The partially-clothed partygoers wind up locked up in the mall, and have to fend for themselves. The gang employ some video game tactics -- Crawling through air ducts, and hurling propane tanks at the robots and shooting them. Hmm, ahead of their time! Chopping Mall boasts a not-so-awesome laser show, and a guy and his gum. Pretty good as far as these things go."
4,Short Circuit Goes Mad!!,"I love the name of this movie ""Chopping Mall"" perfect 1980's horror movie title. This movie brought back so many memories of how 80's mall looked like. The cheesy sound effects, bad acting, blondes with big boobs lol! This movie has all the odd, cheesy 80's classic horror effects. And I enjoyed every minute of it.Remember the movie Short Circuit? You know the 80's movie about freindly robot name Number 5? Well that is how the robots look that take over the mall and go on a killing spree.The story line is very simple. Teens looking to party, have sex and get wasted. Instead of having a party at a freinds house they wait until the mall closes and have their fun in a small furniture store. Little do they know, killer robots are out to kill.Very cheesy, but so fun!"
4,THIS IS MUCH BETTER THEN SHORT CIRCUIT !!!! :),"I Will admit that I viewed the Movie Short Circuit the day before watching this movie,I still say this Movie Kicks Short Circuits [...] !!! This Movie is Way More Fun and who cant notice the 2 Hotties Kelly Maroney and Barbara Crampton from the Reanimator film...The Killbots in the film move pretty fast and I Agree w/ the director that they Should have kept the movies original title of ""Killbots""...Anyways, View this Guilty pleasure of Low Budget fantasy and have a Blast like I Did :)"
4,"""Thank you, Have A Nice Day""","Quotes the mall security robot after blowing apart a womans head after being caught in the shopping mall after closing time. This movie is a great edition to anyones collection of low budget horror films of the eighties. In ""Chopping Mall"", a shopping centre purchases new security robots in order to keep the mall safe from intruders. However, a group of friends decided to hide out in the shopping centre one night and have a big party. Little do they know that the robots are malfunctioning and start to run rampage around the mall, killing everyone they encounter. The special effects are top notch for the year it was made and the one liners the robots have are extreamly funny. Unfortuantly, the movie runs out of steam towards the end, however the shear coolness (is that a word) of the robots make this movie a definite 4 star rating."
3,or kilbots,decent audio/visual/story/just ok acting. good amnt of action; wish it had lil more w/ less corny. i think that was jim wynorski actin in begin as dad of that goyle w/ her guy in the mall dept. store.
4,Have a nice day,"Without getting into hyperbole, this is the best film made in a zillion years!!!! Well maybe not, but certainly the best from Hollywood's long line of feature films about sexy teens trapped in malls while being chased about by security guard robots who have been hit by lightning and now roll after the sexy teens and try to kill them.The teens are divided into two groups - the two Virgins, and then the Lusty Horny types. Guess who dies first! The robots are very cute and roll about the mall (They take an escalator at one point, thus answering the question of how they maneuver between floors) to chase their sexy prey. The robots shoot rays of light at their prey, just like the Care Bears.The teens, trapped in the mall by these killer robots, must face their fears of robots and the perils of consumerism and fight for surival in the ultimate battle of man vs machine. As the pun-friendly DVD states, the viewer will ""shop till you drop...dead!"" Dramatic!"
3,"Bad, but you knew this....","nobody buys this movie because its good. you buy it because its bad, but you enjoy bad horror movies. its something to laugh at. i watched it once, i'll probably never watch it again."
3,I can't say I'm not disappointed.,"I loved David Schickler's short story *Jamaica* so much I tore it out of the ""*New Yorker* and kept it, and it now resides in my copy of his excellent collection *Kissing In Manhattan* which I bought as soon as I heard it was out, and have also bought copies for friends and family.So when I discovered DS had written a novel my hopes were up.David Schickler is a clever writer and there is a lot to admire in this book, particularly the depiction of the two main characters. But on the other hand some of the plot elements, especially the decisions made by the characters, aren't just unlikely - they seem sort of dumb. So this was a frustrating book for me in a lot of ways."
2,Doesn't Hold a Candle!!,"I absolutely loved Kissing in Manhattan and expected the same quality writing in Sweet and Vicious. I attended a book readingby Mr. Schickler in our shared hometown. He read the book with such enthusiasm that I was hooked and bought the book. However, it was a disappointment. Where his first novel was clever and weaved the characters lives together, the plot in Sweet and Vicious appeared fairly predictable and lacking in creativity. It was a quick, pleasant read but I felt uninspired and disappointed. Mr. Schickler has great talent but unfortunately he did not reach his potential in his latest novel."
5,I Get My Kicks on Route Schicky Schick...,"As a person who favors realism almost every time, I was surprisingly swept up in this bizarre-but-beautiful fairy tale. Schickler established enough credibility through his thoroughly developed cast of quirky characters that I not only accepted whatever absurd, over-the-top thing he threw at me, I ate it up. Vulnerability, weakness and all things utterly human is what makes the otherwise disagreeing themes---gangster life, religion, sex, innocence, love, revenge---come together so perfectly."
2,Not nearly enough,"As an admirer of the interwoven stories in his collection, KISSING IN MANHATTAN, I was sorely dissapointed by this novel. The two main characters, finely sketched in their quirks and foibles, were seductive noir figures inexplicably but reassuringly lodged in the present tense. However, they forfeited all charm as soon as they came together. The pairing and their joint antics were more than over the top, they were senseless, unbelievable and unrewarding. Intimate moments and ""stupendous"" decisions were shown on fast forward and in such a slim novel, you get the feeling somebody got lazy.Let's hope the third book is a charm."
3,Expecting More,"I was expecting good things after reading Kissing in Manhattan, but Sweet and Vicious did not make the cut. Schickler is a beyond-competent writer, but the story failed to evoke the strong emotional response I got with Kissing. The plot is an odd hybrid of a Tarentino film and an X-files episode -- violent, supernatural, and surprisingly predictable. On character development, he tries harder and succeeds less.That being said, this book is a good day at the beach/plane trip read -- It's short and reasonably digestable."
4,Great novel for a lazy afternoon...,"Schickler's latest novel, Sweet and Vicious, is a fast-paced, delightful read. While I thought the characters were a bit implausible, the plot worked for me. This book reads like a softer, gentler episode of ""The Sopranos"". I found myself caught up in the overall motion of the story and I enjoyed reading about Henry and Grace's cross-country adventure. The secondary characters were entertaining, as well.I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book. True, if you're looking for highbrow fiction, then this isn't the novel for you. However, if you're looking for a unique story that's not too terribly taxing on the brain cells, then Sweet and Vicious will deliver."
2,Ho hum,"After a promising start the entire story moved along with such linear precision that it may have been written by a mathematician. Never did it deviate from a plotline that was anticipated after the second chapter. In the genre of heist stories we've come to expect twists and turns until the last minute. Here we had none. I was waiting for somebody to be something other than what they appeared to be, somebody to do something out of character. And the thorough implausibility of the climactic confrontation on stage in front of 5000 people had me shaking my head. Oh, and if somebody would be kind enough to post a follow up review explaining the significance of the hitch hiker, I'd appreciate it."
2,Rather tame love ghost story.,I don't know really what to make of this. Is it a ghost movie? A love story? You decide.
3,"Very Good Movie, but 4/3 letterboxed","It is a shame that Toyko Shock once again releases a movie they list as widescreen in a 4/3 letteredboxed version. What this means is that if you have a widescreen TV , you will have black bars on all 4 sides. If you zoom it to fill the screen, the subtitles will go off the bottom of the screen. Don't bother calling or emailing them because they don't answer. Any movie released after 2004 should be anamorphic widescreen or enhanced for 16/9 tv's. Most responsible companies have always released widescreen in the correct version. I guess they feel if they just say widescreen then they can package anything the the box and customer beware.If you like having a small picture on a big screen this is the version for you."
2,Not so Positive,Not at all what I was expecting. It is more of a mini devotional than a book. It is great when you need a small dose of encouragement; just pull out the little book and read a page or two.
5,FANTASTIC .. ANSWER SONGS .. MUST HAVE OLDIES,"Just purchased this cd, and happy I got it. The sound quality is FANTASTIC along with every song. Memories well worth the money at any price... 75 Dollars was a steal.....Got to get one if you can find it."
4,Good Backpack,This backpack is spacious and easy to wear. It distributes the weight evenly on your back so your load is not as cumbersome. It is very nice in appearance and holds a lot. This is currently being worn by a teenager in middle school and it is a nice fit. This is the best backpack this middle schooler has ever owned.
5,good school bag,the bag is quality... i have had it for a month now and i tote everything in it. so far it has held up and has way more room than expected. overall a great bag for the price.
5,Perfect,"Purchased for my daughter. She begins college in a few weeks. She thought this backpack was great! Lots of room, comfortable, tough and it distributes the weight evenly."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"It just was not as good as I remember, nor was it as long as those cassettes that I had so many years ago."
5,This has both 90 deg and 45 deg angles.,This will not fit a ford f350. This bracket is bent at a 90 deg but also is at a 45 from vertical. when installed on the frame it will be at about a 45 degree angle to the front or back of the truck.
4,The Crosscultural Trickster,"Hynes, Doty, and the other authors in this collection do a pretty good job of negotiating a path through postmodern jargon in order to get to something to say. I especially like the distinction made (and blurred) between the trickster and the shaman--that while both trickster and shaman function as (un)reality instructors within a given group, each can address quite different fields of understanding. In an attempt not to present a unified monomyth but to address issues of divergence as well as commonality, the book's chapters cover a wide geographical and historical range: Native America to Africa, classical to contemporary lore. Well worth reading, this collection implies (as I believe its editors intend) a wealth of possibilities for future study."
3,its cool at first but.....,At first i liked it but then after a while it just got boring not much to say it speaks .
2,Reaper,"One word: SLOW. PC version is fun and exciting, but the Dreamcast release seems to hang and is frustrating. Rent it before you buy it!"
4,EMACHINES T1220,"I OWN THIS COMPUTER MYSELF....I HAD IT FOR ABOUT 3 1/2 YRS....IT WORKED GREAT....PLAYED GAMES THAT WERE NOT MEANT FOR USE ON THE WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION....PAID ALMOST $750.00 FOR COMPLETE PACKAGE....AFTER REABTES, ONLY COST ME ABOUT $350.00....EVEN CAME WITH PRINTER....THEN OVER THE LAST 2 MONTHS, COMPUTER STARTING CRASHING ON ITS OWN....THEN 2 WEEKS AGO, IT WOULDNT TURN BACK ON....JUST FRIED ITSELF....I WENT AND BOUGHT A NEW EMACHINES THIS PAST WEEK....THE T3304....CHEAPER THEN THE T1220 AND CAME WITH A DVD/CD-RW DRIVE, MONITOR, SPEAKERS, MOUSE, AND AN ALL-IN ONE PRINTER WITH A 100GB HARD DRIVE, 5 USB HUBS, DIGITAL CARD READER AND SO MUCH MORE....ALMOST $50.00 LESS THEN T1220....I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE OUT....EMACHINES IS ONLY GOOD FOR ABOUT 3 YRS....BUT NOT A BAD COMPUTER OVER-ALL....EMAIL ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON MY REVIEW....THANK YOU...."
4,great machine,"the t1220 is a fast machine,with little and unexpensive upgrades will turn this into a machine that you cant beat the price,i added 128 mb of memory,10/100 nic for cable modem,added usb 2.0 card as its 40 times faster then the 1.1,for less then $75,00,the only problem with emachine, if you go to there website,you will see they dont have the processor or motherboard in stock for this model,so keep fingers crossed these hold up.as it would probaly take them a month or more just to get the parts in,thats the only reason i give 4 stars instead of 5"
1,Professor is just as loony as the book,"I had the misfortune of having Mrs. Hammadou herself teach me FRN 310. Her exercises in the book are dull, and the problems that she assigns were merely busy work. The book itself thoroughly useless and instead of backing up the lesson plan, it would simply be a source of daily homework which was long and tedious.As you can imagine, since Professor Hammadou was teaching the class out of her own book, she was convinced that every single exercise was worth while and enriching.I have a pretty good background in French, some of the diction that she uses in her book is not regularly used by French speakers. Her sentence structure is often awkward and clunky. Her own expertise in French is questionable if you have heard her speak."
3,Kinda interesting. Really a 4.5 star,"If your are new in the swing lifestyle or thinking about it, this is a nice in the privacy of your home way to find out more about it. We have been in this lifestyle now for 5 years and we found a few new things we didnt know. Dont buy this if your are wanting to see couples in action, you will have to buy a xxx dvd for that. This dvd is just packed with some good information and in-sight."
4,Potterybarn Home,I saw the book and had to have it. I know its a little out of date but the information inside is timeless. Who wouldnt want to look at this book and get great ideas for their own home.
4,"Very nice book, but........","I found it very hard for me to incorporate my traditional style of furniture into some of the suggested ideas in this book. It is a wonderful reference book if you have Pottery Barn furniture, but it just does not work for all furniture syles. This book had a lot of good ideas for color, etc. Great book for Pottery Barn lovers, lacking if you have other type furniture."
3,Old design ideas (from 2005),"Didn't know this when I bought this, but this book is quite old. All the design ideas are from 2005 and look kinda old now. Wish I knew this when I ordered it."
3,ONLY PURCHASE IF YOU DON'T OWN THE OTHER PB BOOKS,"As another reviewer previously mentioned, PB Home is basically all the [PB] design books lumped into one. If you own the others (bedrooms, living rooms, etc.) don't bother. If you don't, this may prove to be a better deal--you get all the highlighted material at the price of one!"
4,So Far So Good.....Only Time Will Really Tell!!!!,"Had a Zenith DVD changer that lasted nearly seven years which I paid $100 in 1999. It finally went out a few days ago after several hundreds of hours of use. Replaced it with this RCA unit. The two main reasons I chose this model were price and playability. I burn DVD's using the DVD+ format. Many DVD players have difficulty reading this format. This unit plays them just fine along with almost any format currently on the market. The pitcure is crisp and clear with no problems. Buttons are a little small on the unit and the remote, but spaced far enough apart that even my fat fingers manager to hit the correct ones. If I get half the life from this unit as I did my previous one I will be happy, as I only paid $50.00(new) for it. All in all I am impressed thus far."
2,Buy it if you're looking for a throw-away...,"I've been through two of these exact same DVD players and both of them ended the same way. Both only lasted about six months. I will admit that I watch a lot of movies but after about six months the DVD player just stopped working. The first one just seemed like it wasn't plugged in and after checking all the connections to make sure it was still in place, everything seemed to be fine. It just didn't work anymore. The second one powered on like normal and opened and closed like normal. But when a disc was put in it, it acted like there was nothing in it. So all in all, for 40 dollars if you're not expecting it to last forever I guess it's not a bad bargain. Personally, I choose to stay away from all RCA DVD players due to similar problems with an older model."
2,Doesn't work at all through component plugs,"I just got an LCD TV and bought this DVD player for it at WalMart (the scariest place on earth). I hooked it up to my TV using the component plugs, which are supposed to create better color on an LCD tv. If an image made up of only black and red is what you're looking for, than this is the player for you. I tried hooking it up through the normal RCA plugs and it worked fine (so thats why I give it 2 starrs rather than none), but i want it to work through the component plugs so now I have to go back to the last place I ever want to be to return it. Thanks RCA! I know it is the DVD player, not my TV, that is defective because I tried hooking up a different DVD player, a Panasonic thats 3-4 years old, and it worked fine through the component plugs."
1,This book is terrible,"I was trying to do research about the Internet, and this book didn't provide any useful information at all!! How can a book by that Tech TV guy not be a good source of information!?? I feel like I was ripped off. I am not a happy customer."
5,do not start reading this!!,"if you get this book and start reading it, you will not be able to put it down! the written style is one of fun and lots of information. the author goes into detail about everything you want to know about the web, and lots of things you didn't even think of. it is a must have for someone that wants to get the most for their money."
1,Hometown Favorites gouging us again!,"What a rip off! $5.50 a canComstock Quick&easy; Lemon Cream Pie Filling 15.75 Oz - 6 Unit Pack?? Amazon usually carries these and I got them for $18, and FREE shipping. The other source on Amazon is Groceries to your door:Comstock Pie Filling, Quick & Easy Lemon, 15.7 oz (Pack of 12) and they want $59.99 PLUS $18.37 shipping($6.53 per can!)!

1,Warning! Slices you open!,"I recently noticed that Bic introduced it's new line of womens razors called, ""Soleil Triple Blade"". I bought them because of the sale price. I used the first one & before I knew it, it sliced a 2"" chunk out of my leg. I'm 34 years old, a veteran shaver. I was (& still am) in pain. The razor sliced me open like a cheese knife. I'll have a scar for life. I've written to Bic w/o response. Do not buy! I repeat, DO NOT BUY BIC SOLEIL! I currently use GILLETTE VENUS."
2,"These are cheap, crappy razors","They will get rid of the hair, but that's about the only good thing they will do. They obviously tried to make the product have an appealing design, but they are cheap and become dull very quickly. They made my hair follicles actually bleed."
1,Worst razor ever!!! UHHH!!!!,"I forgot to bring my Venus razor back home so I bought this cheap Bic razor in Target. It is cheap and I did not plan on spending 10 dollars for another razor. Worst decision ever! It said on the packet ""for sensitive skin"" and I have sensitive skin, that's why I cannot use those hair removal spray products. Now I have razor bumps all over my legs and they are very itchy! My legs are scarred for life. I will not bother to give the rest of my razors for someone to try it because I don't want this to happen to another person."
1,Don't waste your money ladies.,"I want my money back. These razors literally sliced up my legs. Ridiculous. I tried really hard to make them work, being extra careful, and no matter what angle I held them at, no matter how lightly I dragged them, they cut me every time. I tried one, my daughter tried one, and I threw the other 2 in the pack away. I tried to enter this review with NO stars, but it wouldn't let me."
2,"VERY Sharp, & Hair gets trapped in it","I have to agree with some of the other reviews on here, these razors are awful! Sharp - yes, so sharp they will cut you up for weeks! Seriously I cut myself with these for 2 weeks straight, it wasn't one of those ""new razor"" deals that cuts the first time you use them. I used these on vacation over the summer, and couldn't buy something else... They left several cuts over weeks! They also are not made to last, if you have any long hairs, they get trapped behind the blade and it gets clogged and needs to be thrown out very quickly. I guess this is why they are just disposable razors, but I will never buy these again. They are pretty, but that's about it!!"
1,Horrilble,"This razor was awful. It cut my legs up into hamburger. Do not buy it, BIC should stick to pens."
1,Once They Taste Blood...,"they'll only want more! These razors are ghastly. I've been shaving my legs for decades, I'm always very careful, but no matter what I did, these things left a trail of nicks and cuts across my calves and thighs. These razors feel rough against the skin, it's like shaving with a handsaw coated in sandpaper. Honestly, they are the worst razors I have ever used. Like the other women who have reviewed these skin wreckers, I'm going back to Gillette's Venus razors. Stay away, stay away, you'll only end up using a whole box of band-aids to cover the gashes in your legs."
1,Not a good idea.,"I bought these razors mostly because they were cheap and had 3 blades. I figured the more blades the better, because that's usually the case. However, with these razors, I had to bear my way through every use, and now I've given up on them completely. They shredded my legs to bits. I never get nicks with other razors, but with these, I can't shave my knees without at least 4 or 5 nicks. They gave me the worst razor burn and dried out my skin. You may think you're saving money with these bargain razors, but really, you're wasting it because you'll want to throw them away after one use."
1,Horrible - unless you're emo.,"Did BIC bother to do any test runs of this product? If so, they would have easily determined that these razors leave something to be desired: namely, your own skin. After shaving with these razors, I have to wear jeans to conceal the carnage left behind (and after all, doesn't that negate the original purpose of the horribly archaic practice of leg shaving?)! The worst thing about this product is the guilt-induced need to use every one, after paying the exorbitant price (my fault, truly - I was dazzled by the pretty packaging). Thank the lord I finally threw away the last of these monstrosities this morning. Now I'm off to impulse shop some bandaids."
3,Great for Housewarming Parties!,I was snapping pics at a friends Housewarming Party with one of these Camera's (My Camera was different to the Black Camera shown here - It was Silver) However it was the same Kodak Advantix Single Use Camera. Loved the option of having two different Picture Sizes (Panoramic and Normal) Best part is when the Photos are developed all the Negatives are stored in a little handy Cartridge. No more Negative Strips everywhere!PS: Pics turned out better than expected!! Grab one today! :o)
1,Absolutely awful!,"This first edition was left to my late mother by an old friend who died in 1972. I've only just read it, and all I can say is what a soppy piece of melodramatic drivel! Even taking into account the Victoria age in which it was written, it's a simpering, predictable, preachy limp noodle if there ever was one. I don't regret slogging through it though - by not taking it seriously I found parts of it downright hysterical!"
5,perfect,I bought this to feed the squirrels in my backyard on. I put it on the deck and put my seed and peanuts on it. The squirrels love it. The food stays on the tray and doesn't go down between the wood planks. Makes feeding and cleanup easier.
2,mixed to death,"The title of my review explains what I think about that CD. Except of The Great Pretender and Barcelona there is no real good song on it. Since you can get SOLO including the original(how Mercury himself did it and not how an engineer remixed him) Mr Bad Guy and Barcelona albums for the same price than this, you shouldn't doubt. Here, one of the greatest vocalists ever was mixed to a drunken rocker, but in the songs he made besides Queen, he was as people imagine him: a good, but a bit crazy artist who wanted to show this in his songs. THE ALBUM is the product of his vocals and a lot of studio work after his death. Would he listen to it, he'd probably turn around in his grave. Get SOLO and you'll be fine."
3,From the back cover - just the facts (plotline) -,"Sam Paxton (Ernest Borgnine) is devastated when he returns home to his ranch to find his only son murdered and his daughter apparently kidnapped by Army deserters. On a mission of revenge, Sam gathers a small posse and seeks the help of an old friend, a tracker, to locate his daughter. Zeke Smith (Sammy Davis Jr.) an experienced frontier scout with a will of his own, shows up instead of Sam's friend. Sam questions enlisting Zeke, fearing that they will disagree on how to find his daughter but, despite Sam's reluctance, Zeke joins the posse. Soon the posse deserts Sam after learning that the kidnappers are not Army deserters but renegade Indians. Sam is left to depend solely on Zeke to help him retrieve his daughter. Produced by Sammy Davis Jr."
5,Awesome DVD,"This DVD is awesome! It has so many different sections to it, and its only, what, 10 dollars? The bellydancer is very talanted and there is a warm up, shimmy drills, and 3 dances to learn from beginning to advanced - within those are the performance, chorography and chorography breakdown. The drummer is great too, there is even a rhythm workshop with the drummer and the bellydancer. She talks as if you're right there with her, love it!But, its not terribly easy.. I only had one video before this and it isn't very easy for me. Its not extremely hard either but it takes practice.I recommend it!"
4,Great Exercise!,I just love it! Step by step instructions. Something you don't see on other videos. Thanks girls!
5,Excellent dvd!,This dvd is a great way to learn the nuances of dancing to live drumming. Jenna's teaching style is fantastic - she clearly describes and demonstrates the correct way a dance move is to be done and her directions are easy to follow. Raquy is an amazingly talented drummer and an absolute joy to watch. She is also a great teacher of drum rhythms. This is a MUST have dvd for any one studying Middle Eastern dance.
4,"I want more Jenna, I want more Jenna, I want more Jenna!","This is the second DVD by Jenna I have purchased. I love her graceful dance style, original choreography and clear teaching method. Beginners who want to advance their technique would find the practice and drum instructions useful. The three dances taught range from beginner to intermediate with practice sections for each. Probably a bit too basic for the advanced student but still nice to dance along with. I am planning on owning everything in her range."
2,"Interesting, but yo won't watch it twice","this was interesting, but I found myself drifting off, it's odd, hard to understand. Just not a great buy."
4,good review and basic too,"I studied bellydance for about 7 years in the 90's but have not been dancing for about 5 years now, so this had the basics and was very detailed, but also had some really great routines with step by step instructions...highly recommend it."
4,Great DVD,"Love Love Love Phyllis Diller. Miss her also. That whole era of television. I grew up watching Phyllis, Red Skelton, Don Deloise, Smuthers Brothers etc and it was a time of real comedy. No swearing, cussing, talking about private parts etc. There aren't many comedians out there today that can match Phyllis Diller!"
4,One of my Christmas gifts . I have searched many sites,I hope this gift is successful. My friend loves Phyllis Diller and this looked like a very interesting DVD to give
3,"Inspiring, buit too long","This would have made a good 30 minute documentary. The repetitive clips of Ms.Diller onstage got tedious, as did some of the personal anecdotes. I enjoyed it but stopped watching after a while."
3,"If you're a fan of Phyllis Diller, then this film is for you","If you're a Phyllis Diller fan, then this film is certainly worth watching. But honestly. . . I found it to be a bit sad. I think I would prefer to see her simply preform onstage rather than all of the ""background stuff""."
5,"Goodnight, We Love You","I bought this for my mother who used to work with Phyllis Diller during Diller's copyright days at Kahn's Department Store in Oakland, CA. The DVD didn't go much into that part of her life, but it was a gem of a documentary about her life and her career. I used to do a little stand-up comedy so this would be good for anyone thinking about getting into the business."
5,Absolute Necessity for Enochian Practitioners,"I think this book should belong in the Library for all those whom practice the wondorous magick of the Enochiana. If you ever wondered what it was like traveling the Aetheyrs from TEX to LIL, then this book is un-equaled in it's class. If you ARE to travel the Aethyrs, this book gives each practitioner each of the necessary guide posts, that are unique to each Aethyr, that you should look for. It was well written, and gives you insight on what to expect and what you should avoid. On a side note, I think that you should find your own means of traveling to ZAX, pushing aside the rather dangerous method that is given in this book."
3,Un livre avancé,"Ce livre s'adresse probablement aux joueurs plus avancés que moi (17 kyu sur KGS). Il est dense, écrasant mme. Je remets cette lecture à plus tard. Probablement que les joueurs en Shodan peuvent le lire comme s'il s'agissait d'un roman, mais pas moi."
3,Beautiful voice but repetitious,"I love Jill Scott. She has one of the best voices around. This cd starts off promising but then bogs down quickly. It's not her but her choice of material/collaborators. After the third song where the hip hip/rapper guy takes the lead and she is left to support with breezy, breathy vocals, I wanted to scream. She is the talent here and she needs to be the focal point."
3,not her best work but ok,it wasnot her best work but it is ok nothing beats her first cdand she is very scattered on this onenapppy
3,The 1 and Only,"Jill's collaborations album is a great investment it leaves you with wanting more of Jill. It just shows how her talent transcends all music genres from Mos to Al Jarreau. Toward the end of the CD i became a little less inclined to listen because it wasn't enough of Jill's vocals included. However, it's Jill so u can't go wrong. Fav's on album #1,2,3,5,7,9"
3,For Jill Scott Newbies,"This is a great CD..If you do not own any of Ms. Scott's other CDs. It is nothing new, but, the songs are great."
2,Just enough to quench your thirst,"If you like Jill Scott, then this will wet your appetite until the its time for the real deal. While most of the collabos are okay, they don't feature Jill Scott's vocals enough. On the track with Lupe Fiasco, all she ultimately does is sing the hook and some background. I do like the track with her and darius rucker (of Hottie and the Blowfish fame) a lot but the rest is so so fare. Not great or memorable, just enough to quench your thirst."
4,True Artistry,"She's a legend, Jazz, blues, hip-hop & R&B she's got it and its on here. She is truly an artists who paints pictures of pain, love, growth and death and manages to come out better with every stroke."
5,Jill Scott Collaborations,"This is a great purchase! Excellent from beginning to end and there are some real treats in there. Jill Scott is fantastic as a solo artist, and puts her personal stamp on all her work. All the collaborations that you were searching for on one album, so no need to keep searching.Would have been brill if there was a DVD to go with this CD."
5,another GREAT Jill Scott offering,"As a fan of Jill's, I have been waiting so patiently since the release of her last album Beautifully Human in 2004.This music is fantastic! Disc one is very strong with great collaborations. Especially like: ""good morning heartache"", ""let me"", ""eight minutes to sunrise"" and ""the rain feat Will Smith"" - oh and ""daydreamin"" - too hard to choose! Disc two has samples of other artists, so I enjoyed listening to snippets of their styles as well.Keep it going, Jill! You are a voice for these times! Do you forsee a tour on the West Coast? you have alot of fans here!!!"
5,Jill does it again!,I will always continue to love Jill Scott's work! She has a special gift of choosing producers and remixers to give all of her albums the right blend of music! She is also a true vocalist in her right! This album is a terrific value!
4,Pretty good :-),"To be honest, I've never really listened to a lot of Jill Scott music before, but was interested in this cd because of the collaborations she's done with some fantastic artists. She has a stunning voice and while not every song is my cup of tea, the majority is great and I'm really enjoying listening to it and now want to get some of her other work.I already own Lupe Fiasco's cd and that's where I first heard Daydreamin (so I guess she collaborated with him and not the other way around). That song is fantastic and I can't stop listening to it. The other songs I really like are Love Rain, Let Me and Happy Feelings.This is a really good cd that while isn't my absolute favourite, has shown me what a talent Jill Scott really is. I like this."
4,Beautiful,"Jill Scott has not let me down yet. She takes her time and makes sure everything she puts out is coming from her soul. You just gotta love her range of vocals, her range of style and the funk she brings."
4,Incredible Jill Scott,The best opportunity to discover what Jill Scott is capable of and just how versatile she is!! Amazing.
4,"A formidable talent for certain, but still lacks the brilliance of her first album","Earthy, realistic, and more musically gifted than Ciara, Ashanti, and Rihanna in one, Jill Scott just keeps carrying the flag for ""real"" soulstresses in today's music world, and on this album she invites a number of notable guests, some legendary and some not so, to join with her to help create more of the rich, atmospheric ""words and sounds"" that have become her trademark. Not that someone of her caliber would necessarily need such help, but contributions from the likes of George Benson, Kirk Franklin, Darius Rucker (of Hootie & The Blowfish fame), and others is hardly a bad thing. Although the laid-back, easygoing style of veteran rapper Common makes the song ""8 Minutes To Sunrise"" a respectable offering, it also becomes apparent here, like with Mariah Carey, that having singing AND rapping in the same song (especially when you're such a great singer), is usually not such a great idea."
2,Collaborations,"I want Jill to come up with something fresh and funky. Perhaps I'm old fashion, but I think she has not made enough hits to have ""the greatest of"". Go to the studio and make some new/innovative music that I've come to love."
2,jill disappoints,"I purchased this CD thinking I could play it for my students as part of a Black History music presentation. Let's just say the sexual content of the CD prevents me from using it in that way. Jill has a great voice and sense of style and I wish she would sing for the masses, not a limited population of listeners. I was disappointed."
2,A so So Cd,"A cd Id just say its way off the mark wrong songs its just aweful. Id put her with some smooth jazz songs,ballads or r&b songs which would have better suited her voice. George"
2,pretty Average,"Jill Scott at a point seemed like She was gonna be the Anita Baker of Her Generation. the Slow down laid back vibe tracks are all a part of her musical vibe,but this collection just is well Produced but has no stand-out cut whatsoever. She needs a Writer&Producer that could Bring something out of her. I think If She had a R.Kelly behind Her musically she could truly step her game up. she needs to be re-invented&get a new direction musically. when she first came out she had a little somethin,somethin but she has settled for just getting by."
1,Ferris Beach,I am over one third of the way through the book and it still hasn't gotten off the ground. It is just plain boring and one of the most uninteresting books I have ever downloaded. I usually like this type of story but this one is a dud!
3,Different!,"The book was not what I expected and that was a good thing. It was very different than anything I have read before and appealing to me because it was about ordinary ""small town"" people. Each character had its own identity and problems. I enjoyed each person's story and then how they all melded together to create the novel. The only reason I gave it just 3 stars is because sometimes it was a little slow but I did enjoy it and would recommend it as a ""women's read""."
4,Ferris Beach,"Even though this is a different style of story than I normally read, I found this book very intertaining and took me back to my childhood."
3,Young People Meeting Life's Difficulties,"I felt I was in the mind of the young girl as she awakened to life's complexities. The adult characters were a little flat for me, but that sort of worked to help me remember that I was viewing big events from young minds. The book had some charm and some nostalgia, but at the end I felt like I had had a glimpse of something, not an immersion. I would be interested to see what a young teen thinks of this. Maybe it hits the right notes for youth."
4,Growing Up,"Very typical mind set and behaviors of teenagers. Although I've not been a teenager for 70 years, the book brought back memories. Very enjoyable. Jane"
4,Great Read,This was a good read. The story was fun and not predictable and the characters were believable. I didn't want the story to end and I hope there is a sequel some day.
4,Ferris Beach,"So far Ferris Beach is very good, but I have not finished reading it yet. It is holding my interest very well and I can't wait to find out what happened to Sunny."
1,Not the best,I have given this book several tries but I just can not get through it. I kept hoping it would get better.
3,Some Classic Keaton Moments,"""Doughboys"" (1930) was inspired by Buster Keaton's World War I experiences. Unlike the majority of his MGM talkies, the studio allowed Keaton more creative input for this military comedy. Directed by Edward Sedgwick, ""Doughboys"" has some classic moments - such as Buster's performance in drag and his scat-singing with Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards - that make up for the dead spots. Though Keaton was fond of ""Doughboys,"" it's a far cry from ""The General"" and ""Seven Chances."""
5,Best yet ant killer,"After trying many other products for 30+ years, we can actually see results within 24 hours of using Combats ant gel. Unfortunately, new ants always take their place, but at least we can do something visible to get rid of them as they come marching in."
2,Doesn't work.,"It's possible that it may be my fault - I may have misidentified the kind of ants I have. But they will gather around it for a moment, and then march right past it without ever paying it attention again. So I cannot recommend this product, as it has not worked for me."
1,They always seem to come back.,This stuff does attract the ants and they swarm over it but it seems to work for a day then they day after the ants come back twice as bad. I have been using the stuff for about 2 weeks now and the ants are still coming.
1,Product Simply Does Not Work,"I would give zero stars if I could. The ants march happily around this product - avoiding it completely - and continue to swarm. Someone else suggested that the manufacturer may have recently changed the formula since the product appears to have been very effective in the past. In any case, as others have recently stated, this product simply does not work at all. Don't waste your money."
1,Ineffective against my ants,Ants came and liked this product and came back for more and one week gone and still keep on coming back for more. Need to find another product.
1,Did not work for me,"This product must be delicious for ants cause they love it, but it does nothing to them, or at least I did not notice any dead ants close by."
5,the answer,"After trying terro for two weeks, with minor success, I stepped up to combat two days ago. WOW! The ants are done. Gone. Just a carcass strewn trail where they dropped in their tracks after sucking up this nasty jello. Highly recommended product."
1,Didn't work,"I have an ant problem in my kitchen right next to my sink. I left some food out to attract the ants out, then put down the gel. No ants went for the gel. I tried later by just putting out the gel with no food. No matter how I tried, the ants didn't touch the gel. I even tried the gel outside, hoping to see it work in action. No ants. At least for me this product didn't work at all."
3,Buy more than 1 tube!,"Not sure on how the product works yet!However, I bought this to put in my bedroom windowsill (it's rather long) and I ran out of product half way through. Also when applying it was really annoying because there seemed to be air bubbles and u would push and then nothing would come out then push again and a whole bunch would come out!So looks like i'm going to have a buy another tube just to cover the windowsill. Hopefully this stuff works!Update: The gel seemed to stop most of the ants and leave their dead bodies scattered along my windowsill. However some did manage to get by. The gel also did eventually dry out but not for a long time."
2,Too liquid not much of a gel,The product does get the ants out the points where it's applied but the problem is that is not a real gel that sticks to the surface - it drips like any other solution. Odor is also strong.
2,Inconclusive.,The poison seems to work for awhile but the ants always come back. If their ingress point is completely filled with the poison it works somewhat better. If they have a wide point of entry they just go around the stuff.
2,Messy and ineffective,"We have battled ants for a year and I tried all the natural remedies first. I had high hopes that my first try with actual poison would kill our ants, but this didn't even slow them down. The plunger is kind of touchy, so I ended up with blobs of gel all over instead of a nice line. The extra gel dripped out of the plunger while I was moving around, which made me paranoid that my crawling baby and cats would find some on the floor. All of that would have been fine if it killed the ants, but it didn't. I used three kits over two weeks with no results. We moved on to the borax powder barriers and have found those to be much more effective."
3,Works?,"I bought this item in 2009 and it worked great. I had tried so many products and all of them failed to get rid of the ants. But this product worked really well, it got rid of all the ants in a few days, I was impressed. Now, in late 2010 ants came back, so, I knew to buy this product again but to my surprise the same product didn't work again. I don't know what happened. Were the ingredients changed?"
1,still have ants,"Maybe there are just too many ants here. I'm going to try it again. The ants did eat the gel I put out, but there is stil an ant problem. May have to call an exterminator soon."
4,Works,I used it for a week and haven't seen another ant yet (it's been about a month). Very easy to use.
5,This is my first review of ANYTHING!,"RED ANTS IN MY DRIVEWAY AND YARD !I actually bought mine at Home Depot only because it was $2.50 per 27g (looked like a close out sale).I have tried everything else in the past (including some home brews that might bring the EPA a-knocking).Nothing worked - they just moved around.I have been trying to kill these (insert ""naughty"" word here) things for over 3 years.Bottom line(for me)folks ""This (insert another ""naughty"" word here)works"" - I have placed it around the openings of at least 5 large nests so far (still have 1/3 tube left) and within a day or two they are just plain GONE!I LOVE THIS STUFF - You will too! BruceBTW - I had to rewrite this review to get around the ""naughty word"" filter. :)"
1,Not my ants,"Maybe my little red ants are immune to it cause they are aliove and well. On the other hand, 2 other poisons aren't working either. I tried some clear liquid first. They drank that like soda. Some live in the clear plastic housing. Then tried this on. Ant go over to it an just walk away. Not interested. Put down another type of ant trap. The ants in my kitchen are gone. But the ones by my front doo are looking healthier thatn ever. I'll have to pay an exterminator if this keeps up. Insane!"
1,didn`t work 4 me,"I had a major ant problem in the kitchen area.After reading most of the nice reviews on this product,I thought I would give it a try.Now this is just the results I had.NO RESULTS.In fact the ants just went around the bait.It killed NO ants at all.And I put it every where I saw them.For me it was a waste of money and time.I live in florida so maybe its the type of ant I have that this stuff does nothing for,who knows.Looks like I might have to spend even more money and bring in a expert pest control company."
1,The applicator is a problem,"The applicator came with the gel is a problem. One push will empty almost 1/3 of the gel. I only pushed 3-4 times, then the tube became empty. I only applied the gel on the kitchen counter. Then there was nothing left for my bathroom. I don't know if the gel will kill ants. It looks like I have to buy more ants killer, if I want my bathroom and other rooms to be treated. Not sure if the applicator is a trap by manufacture who certainly would like you to buy more."
1,Waste of money,Product lasts about 5 seconds. I don't know if it kills ants but seems a waste of money for the amount of gel provided.
3,Want an ANT KILLER THAT 100% works?!!!,"GET TERMADOR! no other...When you call someone to your house to spray for ants, this is the stuff they use. It gets tracked back to the nest and kills them from the inside out. One application of this, and you won't have ants for a year, at least. Works great indoors or outdoors, doesn't smell.I can't say enough about this product!I'm a pilot, and in no way affiliated with this product, except for its use! :)"
1,Wrong Product Pictured,"The product shown is not the product Amazon is sending out. I have been using this product for years, with no issues. It is the best product I have ever used. Unfortunately, they have not only changed the packaging, but the product must have been changed. I have some of the old stuff and tested them side by side. The old stuff works like a charm; the new stuff they don't even touch. I don't know if this is the case with all species of ants, but be wary."
5,lost trail,"very effective and cheap within days no more ants, easy to use, safe. Would recommend to any body with this problem"
2,Kills some but not all?,"Even after using the entire tube, I still had a plague of ants. What bothered me was that only the first few that crawled over/ate the poison, died. It seemed that after quite a short period of time, it became ineffective."
4,Holiday music you will play for years to come.,My whole family enjoyed this DVD. I would expect to play this as a family tradition every year. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it does not come in wide screen.
1,This is AWFUL!,"Badly organized, badly edited, and the competetion (conspicuous dislike) these men hold for each other SHOWS! I'm very sorry I wasted money on this one."
1,3 Tenors Christmas,"Did not play stated damaged disc, it definitely was a poor copy........ I will not buy anything from Amazon again."
3,Too low intensity for me,"I started using this DVD about 8 weeks after giving birth and for me it was way too low intensity. Shelley has two ladies helping her demonstrate and I thought it would have been great if she would have had one demonstrating a lower intensity than what she was doing and the other a higher intensity version...this is a strategy I've seen on many work-out videos and feel it is very worthwhile! I do like Shelley's personality and energy. With a little tweaking this DVD could be wonderful! All that said, if you are starting during your pregnancy or only a few weeks after giving birth...or if you were not very active before or during your pregnancy, this may be just right for you!"
4,tae bo work out,This product does work it helps with women who just have had babies its not to demanding. The sooner you start the better off you will be but always check with your doctor first before starting to excercise after have a baby. I love doing tae bo. Its fun!!
4,This is a good one for nursing - no jumping around,I like this video because it didn't have any jumping around which is annoying when your milkbags have any milk in them. It is a ligher workout them what I am used to from before baby but that is to be expected. You stand the whole time (no floor exercises). I wish I started using it right when my doctor released me. Too bad it is hard to get.
4,A Fine Old Resistance Story,"This story definitely shows its age, and you may end up paying dearly for this book. But you'll probably find it's worth it. This is a classic true story of Scandinavian resistance to the Nazis during the Second World War. I find these acts of courage to be astounding. There's a ham radio story arc, too. If you're into amateur radio, there aren't that many stories you can find! This is a great one. So I'd have to say this book is inspiring, as well as being a great old fashioned suspense yarn. Enjoy!"
1,Anger is an energy that achieves what?,"Nehring takes to task the postmodernists who dismiss anger and strong emotion in rock music.These critics see rock as being simply a packaged consumer product, whereas Nehring would like to think angry rock has some sort of significance.He never explains exactly what are the positive things this anger can achieve.He shows a lack of knowledge of psychology and true initiation when he criticises Michael Ventura, and Robert Bly (author of The Sibling Society), who have written with insight about the predicament of modern youth.This book has hardly anything to say about actual music.It is mostly negative, being a shallow critique of ""postmodernist"" views on rock music."
1,poopoo,"This book is horrible. it should be burned at the stake. dont buy it unless you like wasting money on books that resemble poo poo. thank you, good fight and good night."
4,A Slicer that Really Slices,"I looked at several slicing knives in the Shun Classic price range. I chose the 9-inch slicer because it is large enough to handle large cuts of meat. The first thing I tried it out on was a braised 6-pound beef brisket; it worked perfectly. Beside the hollow ground grooves in the blade, which cut down on blade drag, I like the knife because the handle fits my hand well: not too small, mainly. It just gives a comfortable fit. For the time being I store the knife in its box; I don't have a slot big enough to accomodate it elsewhere -- at least not yet."
3,"Maybe it'll get better, but for now...eh","I found this EP by chance one day, then remembered the name as a band who was opening up for Nebula, who I was going to be seeing in a couple weeks. So I popped the disc in and woah! This stuff was good! Real good!So I'm like cool, these dudes know how to jam, they know how to lay down a SERIOUSLY heavy wall of sound with deep resonant grooves, drum bashing and rumbling bass. Then the vocalist started singing. Or actually shouting. Which was also cool, 'cause it matched up with what the music was doing really well. But then the 2nd song was the same thing. As was the 3rd. By the 4th and last song, I had a headache. And not just because I drank to many beers last night.I mean, the music was cool, ""No"" in particular is a jamming, rocking tune, but I needed (or wanted) some more variety out there. The leaders of this fuzzy rock genre give you some spin and take some chances with their records. Hopefully, J.J. and his merry crew will too with future releases."
2,Obsolete,"Years ago I depended heavily on Maclink Plus. Time passed and I found some of my documents were no longer accessible. I find now that the newest version of Maclink Plus no longer supports those formats. Usually I can find ways to open them, but not, ironically, with Maclink Plus. Simply put, in my view a formerly great product is now just mediocre and of little use to me."
5,"Reliable sources say the screenplay is ""in play""--fantastic!","My third time reading it! The Movie would be a really decent contemporary sequel to ""Close Encounters"", because it's that different. The Ace Bark character (Art Bell...sort of?) is a great addition, and there are unpredictable twists every few pages! I'm glad I read it ahead of the pack. Watch out! Sooner or later this will be a movie. Uh huh. That's what I know."
2,this doens't work for diabetes,"I bought these for my dad after hearing about the wonders of bitter melon on the diet. He took this religiously for about a month, didn't really change up his diet or anything, and it had absolutely no effect on his sugar level. I don't know if there needs to be also an accompanied change in diet, etc. but this alone definitely did not reverse anything. However, I guess it's probably actually Bitter Melon, it just didn't have the effect we were looking for."
5,Strong and beautiful,"The chain and clasp are very strong. It's also very shiny in person, I was surprised the quality was so good."
3,Excellent textbook...,"As long as you want to study the bioarchaeology of man, it is a good book to use to teach. However, it is not the kind of book that the amature should try to read without a good resource to explain many of the subjects. Works great as a text during paleopathology."
5,an album for the ages,"thank you so much for remastering this classic. in 1968, in the midst of hard rock and intense soul music, thismasterpiece emerged. every song speaks to the humanity of life and love. it takes you through every mood,soothes as well as excites. i feel so lucky to have lived during such a vital musical era, and i feel this album wasand still is one of the most significant ever."
4,rare and good musician,"It's a product that anybody that like to hear a good brazilian musician should buy and, the important thing, it's a rare CD.Buy it and enjoy it a lot.Gustavo Pugliesi"
3,Wasn't what I thought.,"This wasn't the group Dada, that I had in mind, but I kept the cd because they're ok."
4,So that's how it happened!!!,"The first novel was just good enough to make me continue reading the trilogy & this one blew me away.The Lightbringer starts to lose his grip on his sanity, Cathan starts to wonder if he's fighting on the right side & you find out who REALLY brought down the wizards: Fistandantilus of all people! There's enough surprises in here to get you interessted."
3,Spooky Rhymes and Riddles,"Spooky Rhymes and Riddles by Lilian Moore is a good book for children between the ages of three and seven because of its short excerpts and simple wording. The book lends itself well to be read aloud to children for Halloween time. To add to the short rhymes and riddles, small illustrations are added for a little bit of visual appeal. The book is illustrated by Ib Ohlsson who uses primarily orange and black for his drawings. This book is themed to make Halloween a fun holiday for children, in which the colors of the illustrations are a continuation of this theme. It is published by Scholastic and is an easy reader for children who are just learning how to read. This is a good book for young children, and a good book to read aloud to a group of children."
3,Book is really for kids,"When I purchased this book, I thought that it would be a serious book about the cultural cstoms practiced by western culturs during the last century, but upon furher investigation I found that it was a children's book. Please don't be fooled by the academic title like I was."
2,It would have been an interesting article,"This book is not really a study of the films of the Perestroika and Yeltsin era. It is more of a sociological study of Russian filmmakers as a class. Faraday presents his thesis (over and over) that late Soviet conditions made the filmmakers a privileged class that resented the restrictions placed on it but failed to connect to popular taste in any meaningful way. Thus when the USSR collapsed, Russian filmmakers were unable to make popular films and became marginalized.This would have made an interesting article, but as a book, it goes on for too long. Also, it would have been nice if Faraday had actually discussed some of the movies. The only movie he discusses at any length is ""Burnt by the Sun,"" which he dislikes as trite in theme and overly pretty. Overall, this was a disappointment."
1,A Vague Textbook,"The book has wealth of information for those absolutely new to Food and Beverage. Don't look for inside hints or for good restaurant or service systems for the professional, it's just not there. I ordered the book to improve my knowledge of the finer points of service, what I got instead was a rehash of basic techniques that have been better presented elsewhere. Disappointing for the price."
3,A study in war time propoganda,"This video is a collection of three short films about the role of women during WWII. Each is heavy in propaganda, though the last is saved by Katherine Hepburn's narration.While the video's tape quality was good, the source was average. Don't be surprised at the picture quality, as the film had deteriorated a great deal before it was transferred to tape. The sound has suffered, too.This particular video isn't meant for everyone; however, if you are interested in the attitudes of the average person, and how propaganda films were geared to ""guide"" those attitudes, then I suggest you order a copy now. It is a good choice for a historian's or feminist's video library."
3,"Not the best, but it is Rescue Heroes","It is difficult to find any products related to Rescue Heroes aside from the toys. The other books I found on Amazon seemed a little elementary, and some have moving parts that are bound to get broken. This book is not the highest quality I've ever seen, but my four-year-old son enjoys it. Each page shows a picture of a Rescue Hero and tells a story from that Rescue Hero's childhood that made him or her want to become a Rescue Hero. The illustrations look more like still shots from the cartoon, and the quality of the writing isn't outstanding, but if your child likes Rescue Heroes he or she will probably love it. My son asked me to read it about 5 or 6 times the day it arrived."
3,Very bare bones,"My three-year old loves the Rescue Heroes, but this book really didn't capture him. The writing is pretty bad--almost as if the writers underestimate the comprehension abilities of small children. The stories are very short and very cliche. The illustrations are just what you would expect from the Rescue Heroes line. It would be better if they started a series of books about the Rescue Heroes, and dedicate one book of this length to each character. I'm not impressed with this effort. We definitely would like to see more books about the Rescue Heroes."
5,WHY WE BECAME RESCUE HEROES,Nice book. It's not a story book. It gives a page or two description of each rescue hero's personal story about why they became a rescue hero. My 4 yr old son really likes it. Good book for young boys.
5,"great, but I didn't read it.","I wanted to read, so just read and I wanted to find imformation for my reseach, but I couldn't read this. If I want to read this book on internet, then what i should do.. tell me, please."
5,My fussy mouse is a big Tasty Twigs fan,"I'm always on the lookout for chew stick products that my mouse will consistently enjoy......I prefer not to use products with sugar or corn syrup but he doesn't seem to care for the plain wood chew sticks that my chinchillas enjoy. This is the first product that I've found for him that he always goes for as soon as I put some in with him. They are the right texture for trimming his teeth and are a great size for mice to carry around, especially when you break them in half. He loves to carry them into his hidey hole for later.This product is cheap enough so that it's worth trying if you have a fussy small rodent. I can tell you that they are a big hit with my mouse - give them a shot with your mouse, gerbil, or hamster."
5,Great Treats!,My rabbit loves these treats! They are the perfect treat for training him to come and other things because they do not upset his stomach.
4,La forza del destino,"Though the voice of Lontyne price seems past it's prime,her technique was still attractive. and other singers ,especially Leo nucci,and maestro Levine made this disk one of the best available video of ""La forza"""
3,Superb but marred by including Leontyne Price,"OK I purchased this only to have some record of this special diva (Leontyne Price) for my library. This opera has a fantastic story, with sublime music and libretto and fantastic performances by everyone but Leontyne Price. I have to agree with other reviewers. We must resist idolizing greatness after its time by allowing them to appear in operas when they are past their prime both vocally and in age. I mean come on....the role called for a 20 year old with a youthful and powerful voice. You won't see movie moguls casting a 50 year past old plump movie star in the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind or as Blanche in Streetcar Named Desire. So why do we do this in opera? Quite frankly I now have to look for another La Forza del Destino for my library....because this is not it.The only one so far who seems to pull it off at this age is Kiri Te Kenawa."
5,bravi Forza!,"First off all, one must remember this is a LIVE performance, and a very good one. It seems my fellow reviewers perfer the studio recording, which often come off a bit cold.I am an operatic dramatic tenor, and find the singing very good. As for the wonderful tenor Giuseppe Giacomini, of the school of Corelli, Del Monico, thank God! This is after all a dramatic tenor opera folks! Remember Richard Tucker? And do you know what it takes to sing Verdi? Not easy! The duets between the men are wonderful!What can be said about the great Leontyne Price? Will be There ever be another Spinto Soprano like her? What would we give for moment of her glory today?So, BUY THIS! It's GREAT! BRAVO VERDI!"
3,A GREAT MEMENTO OF A GREAT SOPRANO,"This performance is worth having as a reasonably good representation of ""Forza del Destino"", an opera not abundantly available on DVD, but more so for the presence of Leontyne Price in one of her greatest Verdi roles. True, the voice is not as resplendent and luscious as it was some seasons earlier, but the grand authority and imperial voice remain intact. I really wonder who could sing this role as well today as Price does on this Met video. Like Zinka Milanov before her, Price is a Verdi soprano to the manner born, and her bearing and personage alone makes her assuption of this role treasurable. Granted ------ it would have been better for her to have appeared in a DVD of this opera a few years earlier, but in her case, it's better late than never. Now if the Met would only release her farewell 1985 Aida, which, while not as vocally infallable as it was a few years earlier, is still good enough to blow all of the other competition away."
4,A Tribute to a true Diva,"Although La forza del destino is not my favorite opera by Verdi, it does showcase Leontyne Price's magnificent voice. At times it almost seemed as if the composer had written it for her. As for the DVD, it is wonderful to be able to view the opera singers up close (something one never sees on the stage, even with opera glasses)and see the emotion on their faces. The lighting was quite dramatic, although I was a bit disappointed in the sets and expected much more from the Met (as I have seen far better and grander sets at the local operas where I live). All in all though, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who admires Leontyne Price, as well as to anyone who hasn't had the opportunity to see her perform. Brava!"
2,What DVD were all these reviewers watching?,"I am appalled by all the praise heaped on this DVD. There are many good things about most MET productions but often they utilize a big name who is well past their singing years. Why can nobody see that Price's performance is a DISASTER! We all remember her early recordings which were full of wonderful singing. But by the time this performance was taped she was less than a charicature of her former self. Her tone is often hollow, she approximates most of the melodic lines and doesn't bother with many consonances. Yes, its a shame we have nothing from her best years but lets admit that this the present performance is nothing to rave about. Like the MET Rigoletto which faltered on McNeil's long past retirement lead, this should never been released.Sadly, here is another great work for which there is no really adequate performance on DVD."
4,Useful guide,"This is a vey useful guide to the social contract. It's especially good in showing how The Social Contract fits with Roussea's other writings. It would be a good book for students of political science, philosophy, or those interested in European history. It doesn't presuppose a great deal of philosophical background, but isn't boring for those who have it. I especially though that Bertram did a nice job of connecting The Social Contract with Rousseau's other writings, showing how they fit together (or don't, as the case may be.) I would have liked it to be a bit longer and more in depth at times, but it's a nicely done, informative, and readable book."
3,Hard to finish,"Beware: if you are purchasing this book, the chapters are quite lengthy and makes for very dense reading. Can't leave it to do the night before or the day of."
4,"Great Picture, but....",I Have never been crazy about any RCA products but the price was right and I needed an inexpensive upconverting player fast.First off the up converting on this player is awesome! Even my back-up dvd looked phenomenal. however through the HDMI cable this player did not seam to do a very good job of separating the audio through a 5.1 receiver. Front and rear speakers seamed to be playing the exact same thing. Bummer!! I ended up taking this back to the store and purchasing a Panasonic DVD-53k which is supposed to upconvert to 1080p. Well my DLP TV recognizes the Panasonic as a 1080p signal but the picture is noticeably grainier than the RCA player. But the Panasonic does a wonderful job with the 5.1 audio. If only the RCA did as good as a job with the 5.1 audio.
1,Waste of money,I am an avid electronics fan and have not had any problems ever with any piece of equipment that I have bought. Until now. This DVD player is not good. The picture is awesome (when it shows up). You often have to shut off the dvd player and then start it back up for the sound or picture to work using the hdmi output. Very annoying.
5,Great upscalling DVD player with built in card reader!,"I bought this DVD player becuase I purchased a widescreen LCD HDTV and wanted a good dvd player with an HDMI out port on it to upscale my dvds to make them look better on my new tv. This dvd has worked flawlessly. It has an HDMI port, composite out and component out and has a 9 in 2 card reader so you can watch slide shows of your images straight from your camera cards it can also read mp3s from those cards to make a music slide show. This dvd player comes built in with TV Guardian which can filter out foul language on dvds, I havent tried this feature out so I cant really comment on it. I would recommend this dvd player to anyone wanting to spend a little more to get HDMI support to upscale dvds. It is very sleek looking out of the box in a wide but thin stance. Great buy!"
1,3rd RCA player to last less than a year,"I bought this for the TV Guardian feature to replace my last RCA DVD player. The prior player was a replacement for another RCA DVD player. All different models, all purchased for the TV Guardian feature. None have lasted more than 8 or 9 months. For the cheap price I was willing to consider it a ""disposable"" item the first couple of times. I guess I'll try something else. when they worked they were OK using component and optical outputs. Getting the HDMI output to work was a constant battle not worth fighting on this unit."
1,Locks Up!,I am now on my 3rd unit in 4 months. After 2 months of normal use the player would freeze and not power back on. This was the exact problem with the first one and second one as well. I will soon find out on the 3rd one but I expect it to fail.It is a shame though because the picture and features are awsome.It is annoying to have to power down everytime before a show to get the audio to go throug the HDMI cable.So far I am 2 for 2 defects. That is unexceptable.
5,great!!,I use this for a 55 gallon water barrel so I can move it around with no problem.the only thing i didnt like was it is made in china.
1,poor packaging can lead to damage dproduct,"Items were VERY poorly packaged and as a result partly burst out of the box well before arrival. The items were not damaged per se-dlight scratches; but all purchasers should check this promptly upon arrival. the price is good for the item, but the shipping is poor and invites disappointment."
2,could have been better,"This CD is carried by the popular mix of living on my own, which was a hit throughout europe. So I got the tape of these remixes. And I have to say that it is really only for fans of Mr Mercury. The second Living on my own is completely trash. If he knew what they did with his music, he would roll over in his grave. The only good song except of Living on my own (1) is my love is dangerous. The other stuff is also on ""the Album"". Very disappointing, the producers just wanna gain money with that, nothing else."
2,To Much Spanish,"My native language is spanish, and even for me there's to much spanish in this CD..."
3,"WRONG ITEM, BUT NICE SELLER","the product did not fit my laptop, but the seller DOCTOR PC took it back and refunded the money fully. I think that Amazon needs to list some of these items more clearly."
5,A new lease on life.,"This book has been a great way for me to focus for my day ahead. I recommend it to anyone who has a hectic life, just take a small time out, and be refreshed by this inspiration."
5,"knowledge i need, daily","This book is absolutely amazing. I have been practicing it for more than 3years now. It has put meaning into my life. It is a valuable treasure. It is the best gift i can offer and share to someone. Its knowledge is what i need, daily. This book is dearest to my heart and will always be. To Mr. Vijay who has always been very kind and tolerant with me, thank you. I offer my life to this Service."
5,The personal and inspirational story of Jill Briscoe and her encounters with her spiritual self,"A highly recommended read, The Deep Place Where Nobody Goes: Conversations With God On The Steps Of My Soul is the personal and inspirational story of Jill Briscoe and her encounters with her spiritual self and how she found God in the midst of her own heart. Readers will undoubtedly find The Deep Place Where Nobody Goes helpful and encouraging while traveling their own path to God and embarked upon their spiritual self-discovery."
5,A Book With a Heart!,"Something I kept coming back to! I was exposed to the practice 3 years ago and I shall say it was worth it! Finally, a book which is more than just a book.... My life is not perfect but every time I pick up this book, I am constantly reminded of my very purpose of being... Mr. Vijay Eswaran has not just written his thoughts, but shared his very heart through this amazing book. A must-have! It works miracles! :-)"
5,A Master Book from A Master Mentor,"I found the book different from the conventional ones, in the sense, it doesnt baby-sit you. It provides plenty of room for the readers to ponder and assimilate the contents without being pushy. I feel thats very very important because the message conveyed and lessons taught in this book is truly life changing forver and hence allowing the reader to assimilate the thoughts himself is crucial.Sphere of Silence - A methodology to follow for the rest of the life for those who want to make a difference in their lives and also in the lives of their loved ones."
5,Great Things comes in Small Package!,"No other books on the shelf so far which i have come across on the topic of SILENCE. This book is as rare as a jewel and after reading it, I have no doubt this book will sell thru generations and touches heart irrespective of creed, religion or race. The reviews so far have gone across continents from as far as canada to australia. One would have realize the essence of the paradigm that Mr Vijay holds true to that the master guru is always in us to guide us through our life which is a quest itself. The thing that strike me most is that a simple daily practise begets a habit which can be powerful to mould us into the right path of achievement and karma of righteousness. A practise i truly vow for has been put into words now with simple words.Thank you Mr Vijay..."
5,Brilliant,"An amazing must read for every individual. Really loved it. Dato Vijay Easwaran has give the world a brilliant book, describing how to be successful. It is not at all a self help book, but a reference, that you go back to when things are not going the way you want."
4,Book Recommendations,"Not sure what to read? Looking for something great? This book will help you find it, for any genre. It lists 500 good books and gives a brief summary. I liked that it was arranged by genre, so if you're looking for a specific type of book, you can just flip to that section. And it's helpful to see how many of the books she's listed you've already read. I've read 100/500 of the books listed so far. So that's 20%. Not bad. It gives you plenty of information about each book: when it was published, the number of pages, and recommended age range. Also, at the end of the book, there are ""additional titles of interest,"" books arranged by geographic location, and by historical time. This was a great feature of the book; the different ways the books suggested were organized.One thing that was annoying about the book was that it had a lot of spoilers. I mean, A LOT OF SPOILERS.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"
3,Mediocre at Best,This book tends to list all of the same books that other book guides have listed. It might be a good starting point for a young teen but the average high school sophomore will have read most of these titles.This book got freecycled after just a week or two!
4,Brings back good old memories...,"Back in the eighties in the time of the first video game arcades Frogger used to be one of my favorites. Now this 3-D version, with several variations of the same theme, comes back. I have to say though (maybe it's because things have evolved) that I was not so thrilled to play it as I thought I'd be. But still it brought good old memories."
5,WAY to easy... but its da bomb,"For those of us who are sick of the dark natured games coming out lately would truly apprecieate a game like Frogger 2. It is great! With lush graphiics that are great for this type of game and a toe tapping soundtrack you can't lose. My only disappointment is that it is to short and way too easy but a great purchase altogether. I am a huge adventure fan and I love it, you must get it."
2,"Frogger is pretty fun, but WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, TOO EASY","frogger is pretty fun. i rate it badly, though. The case lies. It said that there are 30 new levels, referring to the fact that it has old levels, about 5. So 35 levels were supposed to be in there. Really, there are only 17 unbelievably easy levels in it. That's 48% of what it was supposed to be! Now, the reason to believe me is because really, i am a school GENIUS. when i get home, after completing my A+ homework, i play my dreamcast. I am a total fan of adventure games and almost nothing else. Frogger 2 is adventure, and i would know if it's good orn not. NOT GOOD. it is just a little bit of fun. But i will recommend you some very good adventure games. They include: Sonic Adventure 2, Super Magnetic Neo, Ms. pac man, 102 dalmations, and rayman 2. They Rule with a huge capital R. Buy them instead, i urge you."
2,"Nice leather, bad clip","I have used this for some months now. The leather is of finest quality, the fit is excellent. BUT - the belt clip system is horrible - it will not hold the Treo in and you end up constantly dropping/loosing it. This is especially disappointing when Sena claims that this is one of the great features - secure hold. Theoretically the clip will only release when the Treo is horizontally AND you push the release. But after one week, it suddenly started releasing the Treo without a need for the release to be pushed. And of course, the Treo is always horizontally anyway (gravity). So I bouth a replacement belt clip (for a whopping $20) and it worked great... for about 3 months! Now it is the same thing again. For such an expensive item, this is ridiculous. The best leather in the world won't help if the Treo keeps dropping out of its belt clip."
1,Python Reman Mass Air Sensor,"Ordered this part for my 93 Camry after pulling Mass Air Flow fault code. Installed on vehicle and vehicle would not start and check eng light came back on, after having been cleared. Tried to start vehicle again and it was a go.....but.... after driving several blocks, eng died and would not restart. Remanufactured part from Python was no better that my old defective one. Guess I'll have to find my best price on a New OE part. All I can say about Python reman is "" Good Luck"" using them, it's a crap shoot as to whether it'll work and if it does, how long will it last."
3,Well it works but it's cheap,"I bought this because my cat kept knocking over his food bowl and I needed something that would keep the bowl in place. I originally bought a combination food and water bowl that did not detach, but when I needed to refill the water, too ofter water would spill into the food bowl making it soggy. This lets me fill the food and water separately to avoid that mess. While it works - and works well - the plastic is quite cheap. The water bowl sags under the weight of the water when I carry it by the handle, and the bowl does not seem to be dish washer safe. Also, the sticker label that came with the bowl could not be fully peeled off. Large remnants remain."
3,It'll do.,"This product is cheap and plastic. The bowls come out very very easily (I guess that's a pro and con.) I wish the bowls would lock into place, wouldn't take much to implement, it already has the little ""handle"" thing, I assumed they locked into place already."
2,Very cheap looking plastic,I got this for my new puppy but returned it as soon as I saw what it actually looks like. The plastic of the bowls seems very light and flimsy. Also the bowls didn't fit in the holders all that well.
3,it works,"i bought it for my english bulldog because she breaks the ceramic bowls i got,metal ones are noisey,and most plastic ones she chews up.this one seems to be a thick plastic,each bowl removes seperately,which i like,and she can't knock these ones over as easy.my three star rating was soley based on the bowls are small.otherthan that,maybe four,possibly five stars."
5,Great bowls,I bought these on a whim and have been very pleasantly surprised. These bowls are very convenient! Being able to wash out the bowls separately and get water for my cat without bringing the entire set over is great. Everyone who sees the bowls comments on what a great idea they are. I'd recommend highly to any cat or small dog owner.
5,I like it!,When your kitty likes to put pellets of food in his water it makes it easy to refill quickly without spills or just adding fresh water to old water (yuk!). I recommend.
2,ok,"this feeder is still being dumped out by my cats and is still not a raised dish,the removable bowls are very convenient though. think is for a dog dish,not cat dish"
5,Perfect Choice,"I ordered this for my 7 month old Maltese, who loves to tip over her food bowl and scoot the bowl around the room. As cute as this is, she only does it when I first fill up the bowl, not so cute. Read the reviews, decided to give this a shot. Works great, she no longer tries to tip her food over. I love how the bowls have a tab that does not stick out, but is still very easy to use when removing the bowls. Love the color and how easy it was to remove the label, looks great. Wish I had bought this sooner, would have saved a lot of grief and money instead of trying bowl after different bowl. Might order a second one for when I take her with me to work."
3,SMALL,"This is much smaller than anticipated. It is cheap and does the job, but if you have a dog bigger than 30 pounds, get something larger! I have to refill the water almost every time he drinks out of it."
5,Nice feeder,"I bought this for seven week old puppies and unlike some of the reviewers comments, I found that this feeder is very sturdy. The plastic holder is solidly made with two sturdy cups that pop out to be refilled. The puppies have been crawling all over it without turning it over. It will eventually be too small for them just due to the size and how big they will eventually be, but it is perfect right now and is not a cheaply made product at all."
4,My dog loves this...,"So do my kids. This makes it easy to scoop the food from the bin. My only warning is not to put the cups in the dishwasher, just wash by hand because ours got a little warped when I washed them even on the top rack. Had they been a bit sturdier and handled a dishwash, I would have given five stars."
1,Don't buy it!,"The only redeeming thing about this video is seeing those wonderful and talented Beatles. The sound and picture are awful. The facts are out of order and usually inaccurate. About half of the video are historical facts and footage from the 50s and 60s about the social, political and cultural events of the time. Although, these are part of the history, this footage and the amount of time devoted to it, is not mentioned on the video packaging. I guess in the case of this video, you get what you pay for."
3,Not all that helpful,"This is certainly not a ""How To"" book. It mostly expresses the author's opinion of the Mac mini, but it's more for the prospective buyer. There are some excellent web sites cited in the book,though."
1,Most Information not specific to MAC MINI,"Found this book had too little MAC MINI specific information.A lot of information on APPLE software that crosses over to the iMAC and Powerbook productsUnless the MAC Mini is your first apple computer, do not buy"
2,Stopped working properly after a few months,"It stopped working properly after a few months, every time I connected something I had to spread the pins on the power plug in order to have them make contact with the receptacle on this cord, otherwise it wouldn't work. It also started to make a crackling sound a few months later, that's when I stopped using it."
5,Great,"I bought this in 2007 March. It works great so far. Also, you don't have to worry about replacing batteries :)"
5,Tanita Solar is Perfect,"I did a lot of research on scales prior to my purchase of the Tanita. I wanted to have an accurate scale for a low cost. This scale has proven to be ideal. The weight is always accurate, at least compared to repeated weighings on the same scale. I haven't compared it to other scales, my doctor's for example, but it seems right. Also I was unsure of the solar powered feature as I keep my scale in the bathroom under a shelf. However when I pull it out it only needs a small amount of light, from the small frosted window or the low wattage bulbs in my bathroom, to work great. I highly recommend this scale to anyone."
3,Ok,"Ok for the simple functions, but slower than most custom computers because of the bundled software you get from hp. Good for just the casual user, but not up to par for a person that needs great results"
3,Just Average Picture,For a projection set from a quality manufaturer such as Panasonic you would expect that the picture would be ultra sharp. Unfortunately it is not. It's really not a bad set but Panasonic just can not deliver a sharp picture in a 51 inch screen. The fact is you need a very very large room to really get the best use out of this set. If you sit too close to the screen the picture is just not going to look sharp.
4,THE ANTI-AA 12 STEP REBELS HAVE ARIVED!,"Drunken Psychobilly/horrorpunk band from the city of Albuquerque (USA). Fun, rockin, Hallloween music! 12 Step Rebels are also very good live. For fans of TIGER ARMY, NECROMANTIX, and HORROR POPS."
3,Short and magical: not a bad book,"Although this book is far from being a 5-star book, it is short enough to maintain the reader's attention. It is an interesting story that happens in the middle of nowhere, in one of those corners where civilization never arrived.Forget about the ""love story"" part of the title: the old man is a wise, self-made jungle man, who learnt to love and respect the Amazonic nature; he is what connects us from our life in the cities to the lifes of many in the remote places of this beautiful planet; he is, paraphrasing Sepulveda, one of us, yet not one of us.I would recommend this book to anybody interested in traveling to remote, forresty kind of place. It will give you a quick reminder of the enormous respect that we owe both to mother nature and to the traditions and customs from those living near the jungles. The book will also give you a sense of how cruel nature can be (including human cruelty)."
5,Beautiful story with classic proportion,"""Old man"" is a short but beautiful and poignant story. I cried at one point. It is not a sentimental love story. In fact, it's not a love story at all, so don't be misled. It's a simple and moving story about life set in the Amazon. It felt much like Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" and had the same feeling of directness and simplicity combined with profound truth. Sepulveda is much more in tune with contemporary sensitivities than most people would find Hemingway (although I love Hemingway's stories). A major theme of Old Man who Read Love Stories has to do with the destruction of the Amazon. This is not to say the story is any sort of politically correct pablum. It is much more profound than that. I think Hemingway would have approved with gusto."
5,Beautiful and magical,"I read this book in a university anthropology class, and I loved it. It is a extraordinary book about an elderly man in the Ecuadoran jungle who spends his days reading and thinking about love and faraway places. When nature is disturbed in his home, the old man is placed in a conflict between man and nature. It is a short book, full of beautiful imagery and poetry."
5,The Old Man Who Read Love Stories,"This novella examines the interrelationship between man and nature. It looks at the delicate balance provided by man when he respects the natural world, and the destructive forces that work against it when disrupted by the ignorant. Luis Sepulveda illustrates his story beautifully. He employs a cast of colorful characters with dramatic events that ultimately end in an explosion of sorrow. Do not be deceived by this books small size. Sepulveda has filled his narrative with layer upon layer of understated connections that leave the reader thinking well beyond its reading."
4,snappy item,"I hadn't used my camera for years, and decided to get some film. I then found out that the stores no longer carry it, but I found it on the internet. The first business wanted a huge mailing fee, so I next picked a dealer in Amazon which was much better priced.Next was how did it work? I looked over the camera and the film, and then wondered about battery replacement after all this time. The computer helped a lot because it told me of the ingenious idea of putting a spark in the film pack to have the old battery working. After all these years it still worked, and I have a very good photo, and am looking forward to a family get-together in October using the rest of my two packs."
1,old-poor quality,The particular film ordered was old and produced a poor quality finished product. The age of the film was not given. To have known the expiration date would have been helpful. The lack of transparency regarding this product is troubling.
4,"IT HAS A STANDARD HEX BOLT, NOT METRIC","Yes, folks, I bought this thing, and now when I use my smaller face mills, I'm stuck securing them in with an old pair of scissors rather than a proper hex wrench. Why? The retaining bolt isn't metric. I mean, for the love of god, why not make all hex heads metric? It's not like you have to worry about 400 years of backwards compatibility like with screws and bolts. Anyway, point being that if you have a cheap Chinese milling machine (like me) and order this product, be prepared to have to go down to Home Depot and buy another set of Allen wrenches."
2,2.853146273649820811 stars ~ so i wasn't missing much,"Well, I bet a lot of people would like the sound of Wagon Christ. It is certainly a collection of eclectic accessible electronica, but perhaps a little ""too"" accessible for my tastes. I found the novelty interesting yet overall the feel was a bit superficial. Wagon Christ has played a dancey-hiphop-pop, hypereclectic wash over Plaid or Autechre sound; but, replaced depth and complexity of composition with easy bells and whistles. You might like it. But it is certainly not five-star traffic-stopping art. 2.853stars = inoffensive to the ears, but less-than-satisfying for the head."
1,"Lies, Lies, More Lies, then some Lies","But no entertainment. UGH, why did I buy this piece of crap? If you only listen to one review in your life, please I beg you, don't waste your money and time on this book. Even the thought of reading a raving lunatics rantings is more entertaining than the actual act of doing so. His ideas on morality are just so... um... immoral? His ranting is just so... umm.... boring! Maybe I can get a few cents back as heat by chucking this thing on the fire."
1,Utter Drivel,"Thompson's first (and hopefully only) attempt at a book is a weakly written manifesto. His ""evidence"" is slanted or non-existent. He claims to tell the full truth, yet this is a one-sided diatribe against all media he finds objectionable. One could probably write a fair book that intelligently and accurately explores both sides of the ""culture war"". This is not it. If you are truly interest in Mr. Thompson himself, there are better resources out there to get a composite view of the man, both good and bad. If you are concerned about media and it's possible adverse effects, there are better books available. In short, your money is better spent elsewhere."
1,"Poorly researched, poorly written","I found this book to be poorly researched and poorly written. The chapters presenting evidence were outdated and biased, and most of the rest of the book was taken up with a boring and superficial account of Mr. Thompson's spirituality. It's almost as if he didn't have enough to write about."
1,Incoherent Drivel,"[...] This ""book"" of his is nothing more than a way for him to get a little more time in the media spotlight so that he can continue to pollute the main stream media with his irrational views.The book itself is a poorly written, error ridden thing that the publishers should be horrified that they let gte to print. Having been an English teacher in foregin countries, I can honestley say that I have seen better examples of writing from people come new to this language. Doesn't ""Lawyer"" mean you, presumably, had to go to three years of extra schooling? I would highly reccomend NOT buying this book based on the grammatical errors alone.As for the rest, his opinions are his and he's allowed to have them, however, when taken in the context of everything else he's done in the past year, I would honestly reconsider putting any stock in those opinions."
1,Embarrassing,"It's sad in this day and age to see such an gross abuse of prose. Whatever one thinks of the author's controversial political stance, one thing that is undeniable is his poor command of the English language.Jack Thompson writes as if English were a second language to him, from his ridiculous proclamations to a proclivity for grandstanding that would make Cotton Mather blush.There are plenty of good books out their about violence and videogames. This isn't one of them."
1,ker-ching,"Jack Thompson is the man of the moment, and certainly one of the most interesting people in current affairs today.I, like many others have heard of the sensation surrounding Jack, and was interested in hearing the reasons behind Jacks quest - who was the man behind the mask?Unfortunately, I was expecting an honest biography. What I got was the same tired old politics - more hysterical ranting that anything based on truth.If you HAVE to read this book, please buy a second hand copy - [...]. It's poorly written, and frankly uninteresting. If you can, search the internet and find the same subject matter in a more compressed and less biased format. (there was a particularly good radio show on Chatterbox internet radio.)Jack doesn't need more money, but he does deserve discrediting."
1,"Boring, Poorly Edited, and Insulting","[...] this book just isn't worth the time. The style of writing is bland at best, and really shows that whoever actually put the words to paper isn't an experienced writer. Worse yet the editing seems rushed as errors abound, further degrading an already poor read. It's also almost insulting at points due to its lack of objectiveness, like if you don't agree with the opinions in the book you're a monster.This book just isn't worth your time or money."
1,Finding A Valid Argument,"Despite all of the controversy surrounding this book, it seems unclear as to how he can justify all of his accusations against the media. His case could have been done exceptionally well, but it wasn't. Rather than provide a clear argument on behalf of those concerned with family values, Thompson remarks in a fairly childish manner without any real evidence beyond his own suspicions. This, coming from a lawyer, has me very concerned. It isn't necessarily the language, I will not say he is incapable of putting a sentence together by any means, but his argument is lacking. I wish he could have done better.If you're looking for a book on family values for the media, this isn't it. There is certainly a feel of Ad Nauseum throughout the book. The book simply reaffirms only what Jack Thompson believes, as if he wrote it for himself."
1,"I read it once, I don't plan to ever read it again.","Having borrowed this book from my aunt (who was so disgusted with the misrepresented facts and prejudiced opinions she wanted to throw it away) and read it this week, all I can say is this:I am the brother of 2 other boys who WERE victims in a high school shooting. They, having also read the book, were offended that ""Jack"" could ever think that any person could blame something such as a book, poster, video game, statue, art, movie or television show for their actions.[...]The book, poorly written and with no apparent solution besides laying blame would be better listed as a satire of the topic it's trying to (mistakenly) uphold."
1,A Man that's too far to the right even for a conservative like me,"Yes I'm somewhat conservative in my beliefs and I can tell you that Jack Thompson is a pile of S*** he thinks that video games cause caused Columbine the kids that did that were bullied until they couldn't take it anymore. Nobody paid attention to the signs. Okay back to Jakie boy effective September 25th 2008 Jack Thompson is disbarred and has 30 day to ""GTFO"" so as the old song goes hit the road Jack don't ever come back."
1,FULL OF NO EVIDENCE AND HALF TRUTHS!,"I read this book for a laugth, I went to my local book shop and found it in the 99p bin. Jack claims to know much about video games however he knows very little. He reported that the videogame ""KILLER7"" has full blown on sex and should be stamped with an Ault Only sticker, however I have this game and it has no such content. No nudity and nothing unfit for a 12 year old. He also claims to have gotten rapper ""ICE-T""'s song ""Cop Killer"" banned, [...]. Another downside to this book is that it is poorly written, I seems as though someone with no GCSE's has written it and although I [...] do not surpport the views I feel that I could write this with better grammar and better spelling!(Yes, I noticed a few spelling mistakes)No. Jack Thompson has no idea what he is talking about and should have done more research before releasing this.[...]"
1,"Utter drivel from a hateful,racist, psycho.","To call this book a piece of garbage would be an Insult to actual garbage. It's mind numbmingly pointless and filled with nothing but lies, misinformation, and halftruths. There is almost zero factual evidance to back up any of this mans claims and he omits anything that might reveal him to be the hateful, racist man he is. From his battles with howard stern, to his attacks on janet reno, to his assault on the game industry, jack would have you belive he's a crusader. But in truth, he's a self serving, money grubbing lawyer whose sole purpose is to line his pockets at the expanse of others.Don't buy this book. It's not even worth the paper it was printed on."
1,tripe,"This book is a must read if you want to be preached to about an issue that was settled years ago, it's a must read if you are so out of touch that you havn't figured out that there are videogames and yes some portray people getting hurt. For those of us who live in the real world reading this book was a great disappointment, and waste of time. The writing quality was poor, and the book had a tone similar to a christian revival as opposed to a neutral laywer making a case before a court, or a reader. The verdict is in Jack, you lose on this book."
1,What is this supposed to be?,"[...]The biggest problem I has with this book is I can't figure out what it's supposed to be about. He starts gloating about his successful court cases but then goes on a long digression about his spiritual enlightenment. And to top it off, he uses the words 'video games' and 'pornography' interchangibly (not kidding), I'm not sure why though.If Mr. Thompson wants to write an autobiography, then write one. If he wants to argue his views on censorship, write on about that. And if he wants to argue his legal and political views, by all means, go ahead and write a book on it. But don't try to combine all of those into one book, and cram each chapter with a little of each."
1,Skip this one...,A poorly written and conceived look at Jack Thompon's crusades to save America. Pass this one up. A very clunky read.
1,Praise the lord! He makes everything you do right... right?,"If you've read the quotes on the cover then you already know where this book is going. [...] Yes, the writing style is in dire need of improvement.For those wondering how the book goes along, the preview chapter isn't entirely accurate. [...] The chapters that deal with Howard Stern claim victory, yet the man is still on the air, I believe via satellite [...]In conclusion, I could be generous and give this book two stars, but I won't. If you enjoy stories of how people can use religion to justify their actions, go for it, but as a buddhist I pretty much found the book horribly offensive, [...] Unlike what some extremists will have you believe, it isn't toilet paper, but if I owned it I sure as heck wouldn't proudly display it on my shelf, let me tell you that"
3,"Predictable, but who cares?","This was a story about a young lady, Joceyln, who always dreamed of marrying a Prince. On the day she believes her Prince will propose, circumstances beyond her control force her to marry another man, Rand. Rand is a very kind and patient man who will warm your heart. Joceyln is a spoled brat and knows it, but she has enough charm to be likeable.The romance aspect of the novel was very enjoyable. The dialgue between characters was witty and sweet. Some parts are laugh-out-loud funny and some keep you on the edge of your seat.I consider myself a tough reviewer, so for the average person this could easily be a 4 or 5 star novel. It was my first book by this author and overall I'm very pleased."
4,Marry a prince and acheive your dreams...it can never be that easy :-),"As this was the first book I read by Victoria Alexander, I wasn't quite as annoyed with Jocelyn as others were who'd seen her first in other books. I thought she was pretty materialistic and her dream a little too far fetched, but I think all little girls hope to find a prince someday. She did but discovered (eventually) that a prince isn't the husband she was meant to have. I thought her attitude about her beauty to be very matter of fact and probably similar to a lot of other girls in that time period; I mean, there were only so many things a girl could offer and beauty was the first one to be shown.In the end, she was such an endearing character and her and Rand were so perfect together! A great book by Ms. Alexander, though my favorite so far is Love with the Proper Husband."
3,"Easy, enjoyable reading",I enjoy all this author's works but found this one to be an easy one to pick up and put down when necessary. Interesting enough to hate to see it come to an end.
5,A delight to read!,"Victoria Alexander combines it all in another can't put down novel - great dialogue, a little mystery and a lot of love! She is one of my favorite authors!"
5,HERCULES AND THE MASKED RIDER,"I SAW THIS FILM WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD, THE REAL TITLE IS MACISTE CONTRO ZORRO,STARRING ALAN STEELE AS MACISTE AND PIERRE BRICE AS ZORRO, I LOOKED FOR THIS MOVIE EVERYWHERE I THOUGHT THE ENGLISH TITLE WOULD HAVE BEEN MACISTE VERSUS ZORRO, SO I HAD VERY LITTLE SUCCESS IN TRACKING IT DOWN, UNTIL SOMEONE E-MAIL ME FROM AUSTRIA AND TOLD ME IT WAS HERCULES AND THE MASKED RIDER, WELL AS A BOY THIS MOVIE LEFT AN EVERLASTING IMPRESSION ON ME I THOUGHT THAT PIERRE BRICE WAS THE BEST ZORRO, THE COLOR WAS BRILLIANT IT WAS FULL OF ACTION, I REALLY LOVED HOW ZORRO RODE A WHITE HORSE THE CONTRAST WAS BREATH TAKING, I'VE ORDERED A COPY HOPING THAT IT IS THE RIGHT ONE BUT IF ITS NOT COULD SOMEONE E-MAIL AND HELP ME WITH THIS MOVIE.THIS MOVIE INSPIRED ME TO TAKE UP FENCING, AND I'VE EVEN WON A MEDAL AT SYDNEY UNIVERSITY. ANYWAY CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP. THANKINGYOU KINDLY STEVE."
1,Junk like the rest of the saw,Junk like the rest of the bandsaw.Don't spend your money buying one the saw was junk so was the replacement blade.
5,child's rocker,The child's rocker is just what I was looking for. My grandson loves it and it is not only the right size for him but is a great piece of furniture that fits in with my daughter's decor. It is a cherry color and is very sturdy for a toddler. I would reccoment for anyone with small children.
2,Child's White Rocker from Target,"While I was happy to find the style of rocker available, and in white, I was extremely disappointed in the workmanship as manufactured in China. My ""handyman"" husband had to completely rebuild the chair, as it was required to be assembled and the predrilled holes did not match at the rear assembly. When he made the necessary modifications, the seat split because of the inferior quality of the wood. Once he was able to reglue and mend the split seat and assemble the chair, he had to add 2 paint coats to it in order for it to be acceptable. Our granddaughter now uses the chair, but we learned a valuable lesson to not purchase ""assembly required"" furniture over the internet, particularly manufactured in China. This was our 2nd unsatisfactory experience with such furniture."
2,Child's rocking chair,"The rocking chair sits too straight in the back, so the child feels like he is falling forward and doesn't like sitting in the chair. The chair back needs to lean back a bit to be more comfortable."
5,rocker,"great chair--just what i wanted! will take my grandchild to the next generation. my grandchildren are using my rocker from 50 plus years ago, so i looked for the same quality chair. this rocker has the same quality as mine."
3,Children's rocker,"We purchased this rocking chair for my 21-month old and she loves it. She has no problems getting on the chair... it's a wonderful size for her as well as for my 3 1/2 year old. The chair is beautiful but it does have some flaws. My husband had to redrill some of the holes as well as to create new holes where none were originally to properly assemble the chair (luckily I had read that this was a possibility from reviews on the white-colored rocking chair so my hubby had the drill ready). Also, as mentioned before the back does sit quite straight but hasn't seemed to phase either of my children from enjoying the chair; however, if you have a child who is very particular you may have some problems with this rocker."
4,Good choice for the price,"I bought this for my 6 year old son (he wanted one like his sister's). It is the perfect size, with room for him to grow. I purchased the color ""natural"". It is nice wood and does not look cheap. It is very sturdy, assembly was easy, and I didn't have any of the problems the other reviews mention. The only negative is when my son sits in it, he isn't able to easily lean back and rock. The back on the rocker is angled too up-right and needs to lean backward a bit more. However, it could be a safety feature to keep small kids from falling over backward. Overall, I'm happy with it, and it's a great little rocker for the price."
2,Not as advertised..,"I felt that it was very difficult to assemble the rocking chair. First of all, many of the holes did not align as pictured on the directions. Second, I had to ""create"" my own holes to get many of the parts assembled together. It looks nice after 'magically' getting it put together but it is not as simple as it should be. If you are looking for a simple, easy-to-assemble rocking chair, you should reconsider before making this purchase."
4,Beautiful rocker,this rocker is beautiful. The only problem is one of the poles that connect between the two legs doesn't fit quite right. We will use gorilla glue and I'm sure it will be fine. The grandson loves it.
5,Cotton Belt Locomotives,This book is a MUST HAVE for all Cotton Belt History Buffs and Railroad Modelers. Very informative and chock full of great photos and write-ups. Wish I had bought it long ago!
3,Old graphics but the kids love it..,I bought this video over eight years ago for my niece. Now my kids are enjoying it. It is basic but that is just the way it should be sometimes.
4,"Good Edutainment Video--rocknlearn colors shapes, counting","Okay, we got this video and I thought it was awful, but what do I, as an adult, know!?! The kids (girl 4 and boy 2) loved it. AND after awhile it started to grow on me too.Most importantly it accomplished its mission. My youngest who had previously shown no interest in colors and shapes --other than to jump and slide on them-- now knows his stuff. Not just circles and squares but octagons and hexagons too. In addition, it teaches how colors can be mixed to produce new colors.Not the slickest graphics, but I definitely recommend this for action oriented learners who will sit still long enough for a video."
2,Sounds too good to be true?,"You're right! I bought this software, excited because I want to learn vietnamese, french, tahitian, russian, and polish up on portuguese and spanish. 25 of the languages have vocabulary glossaries only (not that 76 languages isn't alot). But there is really no guideline to follow, there is a long list of phrases, some practical to repeat and good speech recognition software, but I was lost. I found the alphabet to print out and practice, and this software kept my interest for only a couple of days. It is easy to get frustrated because you don't feel like you're learning, just repeating phrases you hope you can remember, but don't seem very practical. I would recommend this software for polishing up already learned skills, maybe, and introducing yourself to a new language, but don't buy the hype that it is all you need to learn ""guaranteed."""
1,Not Worth The Money,"I am a student that studies 5 languages currently. I am very much into languages and I thought this would help me. I bought this software specifically for Icelandic, Vietnamese, Arabic, German, and Inuktitut. Turns out that the only helpful and useful language title was German. Most, actually all of the other languages just gives phrases to practice, and it is the exact phrases as the other languages. It makes learning a language fun, GUARANTEED! Dont purchase this software if you would like to learn a language that is on here. If you are really interested in learning a specific language, purchase Rosetta Stone Software. It may be a little bit of money, but it is definatley worth it."
3,Not for fluency,"This is an EXCELLENT product if you're tourist-travelling, or if you plan to use it as I do: a resource for students who are studying geography of the world. The students will be researching the spoken language(s) of their selected/assigned countries and will incorporate as many native languages as possible into the various products they produce to demonstrate learning. The phrases/words that are utilized in 101 Languages isn't enough to actually LEARN a language, but may be of help if you're tourist-travelling or if you're begining to dabble in the feel of a particular language. It is certainly NO Rosetta Stone, which is where a person should go if needing to actually LEARN a language with software. EASY to use and install."
3,Seems to work fairly well...,"Not the best product of its type (that honor probably goes to Rosetta), but for the money, this software is very hard to beat.Functional, and well suited for young and old - it could be a bit better organized and a little more intuitive. But again, for the price, it is a functional piece of software."
5,Jackie TRULY sets the standards,"I was amazed when I received this cd. I did not know that Jackie Wilson had recorded so many of the great standards....and then, to hear him take each song and make it his own and give it a new dimension, rocked me to my soul....now I am on a mission to find anything else of his that I might have missed."
3,An entertaining read.,"Bino Phillips practices criminal law in Dallas and he's very good at what he does. When one of his lowlife clients, a drug pusher named Sonny Starr, is murdered, Bino suddenly finds himself at the center of a major federal investigation.This entertaining novel is populated by a number of colorful characters. Besides Bino himself, there's Karen Allen a sexy FBI agent, two ruthless redneck criminals named John-boy and Buster, a bookie known as Half-a-Point Harrison and many more.But author A.W. Gray is at his best writing action scenes. Particularly well done is a segment describing a store robbery as it horrifyingly unfolds.Bino is a quirky, irreverent book that does for the city of Dallas what Elmore Leonard's fiction has done for Detroit."
3,Great book - Poor Condition,"I already had a copy of this book that I loved so much, I wanted to give one as a gift. The copy that arrived is not suitable to give as a gift. I knew it would be a second hand book, but the amount of disrepair on the cover, stamps on the pages and other hand writing distracts too much."
1,Cutting Corners,"You know soon after a movie starts whether the cast and film crew put in a worthy effort. In this case, not so, besides jumping between scenes making it difficult to follow the story you also have very poor coherence between every line of English voice over and corresponding English subtitles - just a mess. As an indication of poor directing was the directors use of very difficult to see darkness as a cheap crutch for creating suspense and drama. Creative directing should manipulate lightning to give suspense and still allow the audience to see what's going on. The story itself is a well worn copy of many other horror movies with the same theme of an imprisoned tortured person/soul coming back to reap revenge on the perpetrators and relatives."
4,Standard J-Horror Worth A Look But Don't Expect To Much From It,"If you've seen the first one the second pretty much follows the standard storyline, with the ghost killing people through their cellphones and than going after the other people on the murdered persons call list and repeating the cycle over again. While it has some scares from the ghost it seems to follow the lines of previous j-horror ghost like the ring and Grudge almost so expect to fell a sense of deja vu when you see the ghost scenes in the movie. The picture quality and effects were pretty good and the acting for the cast was decent as well, the english dubbed cast did their roles pretty good as well so no complaints on those fronts. So if you're looking for another j-horror movie than give this one a peek to see if it's for you and while there is a third movie I say pass that one over as after seeing the third movie it just didn't seem worth keeping..."
2,One missed Call 2,One Missed Call 2 was not the best the American version much more intense.We watched it all the way through so there are some good parts.
5,What A Find!,"This is a fantastic discovery for Roy Rogers fans! To my knowledge, this makes 11 out of the 19 Roy Rogers movies that were originally made in TrueColor that are still available in color. I think this would be a good ""colorization"" project...to restore the rest of these movies to their original ""glorious color"". And as for those who are against colorization, they can't say that these movies were intended to be in black and white. Black and white just doesn't do justice to the Golden Palomino,Trigger,or to those colorful western outfits that Royand the rest of the gang wore in those movies. Let's hope theyput out a dvd version of this movie real soon."
5,"cowboy, gentle wild west, entertaining","This hard to find video arrived quickly in good condition. A good, old fashioned cowboy flick about Roy Rogers...the singing cowboy. Back in the day when kids sat around the nighborhood tv and watched cowboy movies together. Roy Rogers had a special appeal with his songs, his nearly human horse and his beloved dog.This is a fun movie...made for the innocent at heart"
2,Good but not worth $50!,"I was either delerious or hungry when I ordered these chocolates. I don't eat sugar so decided to treat myself to what I had hoped, based on the reviews, would be out of this world sugar free chocolates. I received the tiny box and had that ""what was I thinking!"" moment. I know it says 25 pieces but they are some really tiny pieces. The chocolates are very pretty and are tasty but to me, they are on par with Ashers, Bartons, and any other number of very good sugar-free chocolate for a fraction of this price. They also (I later found on their website) contain maltitol which can cause severe tummy upset (and worse) in many people. They are definitely a pretty presentation, and possibly a nice gift but no one will ever think you spent $50 on them (including the high delivery charge). I'll stick to my Ashers and Bartons where I can get really good quality sugar-free for an affordable price."
5,My daughter loves the Popsies puppet video,"My 4 year old daughter loves this video. She calls it ""the puppet show"", though she's had it for quite a while, she'll forget about it and then find it and get really excited to see it again. Unlike many cable and educational channel's shows that jump out with so much commotion I want to mute the TV, the music is first rate and relaxing, CD quality on this DVD, and we talk together, quality time, about all the little skits the puppets perform. 2 thumbs up for Popsies (4 if you count my daughter)!"
2,Not What I was Hoping For,"I needed a video which would be helpful in making a 7-9 year old into a QB. I needed a video which would go over the details of taking a snap, footwork, hand-off, cadence, timing, and all of the other things I don't even know I should know about. At this age level, passing is the least I need to be working on.This video did not meet my needs; although on the surface it appeared as if it would. The picture on the case shows (or looks like) a 7-9 year old focused on making a hand-off. The title talks about youth development.What the video contains are mostly QB drills (and the reason behind them). The drills are being executed by 13+ year olds. Over half of the video covers passing.If that is what you are looking for, I would give this video a solid 3 for the $40 price. If you are looking for a video on developing 7-9 year olds, this is not going to be very helpful."
5,Tastes great and not loaded with corn syrup or sugar,These jerky packs are great. They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies. I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup. I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring. Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition. Keep up the good work Jack Link.
3,If you like SALT,"I thought this was the beef jerky that I was used to getting from the gas station on my trips. However, after eating one stick(really two sticks in one). I ended up drinking two bottles of water.The Salt content!you can taste the salt before the beef jerky"
4,"Good, lean, tender, but not quite as flavorful as I had hoped","I love teriyaki beef jerky, and when I saw Jack Link's beef steak on sale, I had to get a box. They make a great snack, although 2 oz is a little more than I need most of the time, so I usually eat half now and nibble on the rest throughout the day or save the rest for another day. I've also had the smaller 1-oz size, and that's about just right.They're super tender, and very lean, although I have found an occasional little chunk of gristle. Maybe it depends on how they're stored, but I've noticed that some of them have little blobs of white (fat, I presume) scattered on the surface of the beef steak strip. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the flavor. Although they do taste good, the flavor seems a little weak compared to the Jack Link's beef steak nuggets I've had in the past. If they cranked up the potency of the teriyaki flavor, Jack Link's Teriyaki Beef Steak strips would be perfect."
2,It's beef jerky ...,The taste on these are just not right and what I was expecting. I thought it would taste just like the bagged jerky but its not. I would stay clear and stick with the bagged jerky.
1,Mold problem,Have seen mold on a couple of different flavors of this jerky. I keep it in a cool dry place and it doesn't expire for another year.I've had it in the gas station before and it's fine. But the couple boxes I ordered from amazon had ones with mold on them. I personally like this jerky but molding product gets a 1 star review.
2,"Very dry, kinda crumbly :\","I was pretty disappointed with this. It's incredibly dry, to the point of being almost crumbly in your mouth. I also thought the flavor itself could have been better. I've made jerky myself that tastes much better than this."
2,Needs to retain freshness longer...Gets like shoe leather,"Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness. A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste. I would not purchase them again. I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness. Also the sticks get very hard."
4,Pretty nice,"The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in. The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package. Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt). It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather. I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not ""loose"" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern. Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.Nutritional info:Servings per container: 1Calories: 120Total fat: 2g (3%)Saturated fat: 1g (5%)Trans fat: 0gCholesterol: 50 mg (17%)Sodium: 1360 mg (57%)Total carbohydrates: 4g (1%)Dietary fiber: 0gSugars: 2gProtein: 22g"
1,moldy all the time,"When I bought this item the first time, I was happy then I ""subscribed and saved"". What a waste! Once they have their hooks in you, they give you the bottom of the barrel. I even gave them a second try the next month and they were all moldy AGAIN. Terrible company. ""Subscribe and save"" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers. Shame on Jack Links. Pathetic."
1,One of my worst Amazon purchases,"I bought 2 boxes of these at the same time thinking I was getting a better deal than buying from the gas station. The first few I ate I didn't have any problems with. Since then, they either have mold or have been so hard that I cannot take a first bite through it (sidenote: I am an avid carnivore). They need to step up their quality control before selling this."
4,"Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless","I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these. I guess I paid little attention to the label ""Beef Steak"" versus beef jerky. These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor). I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these ""beef steaks"" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost. They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down. With so many varieties, we will be trying more. These were a pleasant surprise and were different.Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving. Quite a lot! Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!Very enjoyable nonetheless."
2,Tasty but very salty!,"I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them. I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway. I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right! I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up. The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty."
2,It's beef jerky ...,I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky. I bought these because I thought it would be much easier to transport with me on the go like road trips but the taste is way off compared to the bagged jerky and I didnt care for it. Very dissapointed in the taste.
3,A little dry,"I love the Jack Link products, but this a bit on the dry side and not much of a BBQ taste."
2,Very unsatisfied,"I subscribed and saved to this kind of jerky in the past, then had the subscription canceled for a time. Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it."
2,To much dietary salt.,"I do like how these taste but there is too much dietary salt. I also found that after eating two, I began to get stomach knots."
1,Eww,These things are terrible. They have a waxy coating and some sort of chemical on top. The taste of the chemical is very prominent. I can't even give these things away.
1,2 more rotted beef steak in a carton,Over and over again I keep finding rotten or stinking beef steak in each carton . The quality control is very poor at Jack Link's
4,"delicious, convenient, and salty","The best jerky I've found for a low price. I'd rather have the organic/free range/etc jerky but am a poor grad student, so this stuff works for me. The best deal I can find for jerky anywhere is here on Amazon.They are so easy to carry around and are very filling. Sometimes they are a little tougher than others, but it's not so bad you'll rip your teeth out eating them. I only have 2 complaints - a ridiculous amount of sodium and a few other additives (like SUGAR) that I'd prefer not to be eating. But still... so good for what you pay for."
3,Great shows (of course!) but not so good video quality :(,"Of course, the shows are the same great ones any Andy fan loves! But the music is NOT the original theme music, and the video quality looks like bad home copies. Had I known, I would have chosen a different set of Andy tapes to buy."
1,My doctor sold me water,"I had never taken a homeopathic before, didn't really know what it was. My doctor sold me this stuff for $135 claiming it would help my swollen lymph nodes. It didn't do a thing. I read labels a lot and wondered what the labels on this product meant and that's when I read about homeopathy. I was so irate I sent a vial of this stuff to a lab to be tested and they sent me the report showing me it was pure sodium chloride in water. I showed this to my doctor and he decided to play stupid and acted like he didn't realize the company selling this stuff was selling water, yet he's selling homeopathics all the time.Do not buy this stuff people, it's just water, and I suspect all homeopathic products are the same way. If you get better and attribute it to the product, then you might as well attribute it to anything else that happened because you could drink tap water for much cheaper and still get the same effect."
5,GREAT TOY,"I've read some bad reviews for this gun and crossed my fingers when I bought it but the gun I recieved had no problems with it at all. It was relatively easy to open up and put the batteries in, just use a screwdriver.My sone loves it and uses it with or without his being in his jango fett costume. GREAT gun, it's held up to a very active 4 year old in the month that we've had it. Hopefully it'll last for a long long long time since he loves it!"
2,"For costume use, it's fine","We bought this to go with the Jango Fett Halloween costume. It's basically a dummy pistol, it doesn't do anything. My son is happy with it because otherwise I haven't really let him have any toy guys. It would be pretty lame as a regular toy but as a costume prop it's fine, but overpriced."
2,Not worth the money,"Great for a costume but as a toy don't bother. This broke within a matter of days. I got it to go with my son's Halloween costume, it didn't even make it to Halloween before it broke from normal kid actions."
4,Noisy but isn't that the point of a blaster,I bought this for a halloween costume accessory and kept the blaster unopened until the big day because of the other reviews that it would break instantly. Ours has taken a beating and still keeps beeping and blaring and making that mind numbing blaster sound and I wish it would break soon! But the kids love it.
3,Exactly What I Expected - You Get What You Pay For,"Got this on a super sale deal, glad I didn't pay any more for it. My 6 year old wanted a new toy gun. Knowing what he does to them figured I'd go cheap.It takes 2 AA batteries, which I didn't know about - makes a laser type sound when you put them in. Not obvious that it takes them so for a younger child, you could probably get away with not putting batteries in.It's not extremely loud, but can be extremely annoying."
1,Do not buy this toy.,This toy gun broke within the first 15 minutes of use. The battery melted the plastic! I would highly suggest finding a different toy to purchase in lieu of this one - waste of money entirely. One star rating since that's the lowest.
1,Don't waste your time with this!,My son and I were very frustrated with this. Complete waste of money. You cannot hardly hear the sounds in the gun. The material is a cheap plastic and one of the pieces broke just barely touching it. Aweful product and had to pay partial return shipping out of our pockets. ugh.
3,You get what you pay for.,"You get what you pay for with this product. My nephew loved it when he opened it and it worked for a couple of weeks. But like many trendy little gifts, it barely made it through Christmas break."
2,plreid,"I am disappointed with this product. When it arrived, it stated that it was to be used as part of a costume and not for play. I thought that should have be stated in the description. I have not given it to my grandson yet because it is part of an easter gift; however, I don't think that it will last long."
5,gotta have......,The tone and mood of this cd are excellemt for reflection and if you are already a fan of hers' do not hesitate....a truly beautiful project!
3,Too many repeat songs,"I love Nancy Griffith's music when she doesn't get to political, but all of her albums, including this one repeat songs she has already recorded on other albums. I feel ripped off every time."
5,I WAS MOVED BY THIS CD,I have been waiting for this cd for a long time. I have followed Nanci's singing career for over twenty years and once again I have fallen in love with her music all over again.
2,The 'torch' fails to ignite,"Nanci Grifftih's 'Ruby's Torch' seems a miconceived project. Nanci is not a natural torch singer, nor do most of these songs conform to conventional understandings of 'torch songs'. Her version of one of the outstanding songs of this genre, 'Wee Small Hours', is successful, but scarcely departs from the version recorded on 'Clock Without Hands'. Something similar could be said about 'Drops From the Faucet', and 'Brave Companion': indeed, the subdued and intimate version of the latter on 'Storms' is more compelling. The three Tom Waits songs are pleasant listening, but the originals convey much more authenticity of feeling.I have all Nanci's albums and, while conceding that some have flaws, feel that all represent considerable achievement. The new album, despite being blessed with Nanci's distinctive sweet, evocative voice, is a disappointment"
4,Ruby's Torch,"While I remain a fan of Nanci's earlier work, I must admit I do like ""Ruby's Torch."" The more I play it, the more I like it. It's a vast improvement over her previous outing."
2,thud,"Nanci is not a torch singer--this was an unfortunate decision to make this album. It is not what the genre tag suggests--alternative country, texas music--it is another feeble attempt at pop. This listener longs for Nanci's early days."
3,"Nice, but...","It's nice looking and does what it's supposed to do. If the coffee isn't hot enough, that's what microwaves are for.Here's the problem. If you use a coffee butler like this to hold your drip coffee holder, the standard Melita does not set squarely across the top, creating a few real messes in the kitchen.If you brew in a Melita and use this to keep your java warm, this will do the job. It's a caraffe, for goodness sakes. But if you brew right into the butler, (like I do) keep shopping. Your Melita filter won't rest securely on the top of this thing.Hope that helps."
5,Great Thermal Carafe,"Not only is the carafe good looking, but the right size to last for a couple of hours before needing refill. It works great for me, and it looks very stylish."
2,Disappointed,"Sorry, but this product just did not work as advertised. It does not keep coffee hot more a couple of hours even when I prime it with hot water for 30 minutes. Extremely disappointing.."
4,Pretty good...,"Tough butt and ab workouts, your muscles will be jell-o the first time you do it, if you don't work out regularly. I walk 4 miles a day, 4 days a week, but I haven't done Tae-Bo for years and it kicked my butt! I don't have the Amp Bar so I substituted a baseball bat :) And get a mat for the floor work. My hip joints digging into the floor were quite uncomfortable. I gotta say...I really miss the original Tae-Bo workouts, haven't found them on DVD.My one real complaint....I can't stand Shelly's persistant and prevalent gutteral scream....what the hell does ""Ah-Sahhhh"" mean??? She repeats it over and over thru both the ab and bun workouts. So irritating! Broaden the vocab, chick. I haven't done the Sculpt Express yet, but I'm sure I'll have to listen to it on that one too. I'll be muting the sound and playing a CD instead."
1,too advanced,i have a cardio workout taebo dvd that i have been using for a couple months(that i love). when i tried this one it was just way too hard - unless you've already been doing strength training on legs and abs i don't suggest this to anyone
3,British Cathedrals,"Besides architectual information, a short history of the catholic church, its politics, hierarchy, and it relations to the commoner is included."
2,Not what I was expecting... with some perks,"As a beginning jewelry designer, I have been looking for books that explain technique and show examples of work. After reading others' review, this seemed like the perfect match for me. While this book is a showcase for ""famous"" jewelry designers, it didn't have the guts I was looking for. Bios and pictures of artists are nice to look at, but don't teach me anything about style and creation.What WAS helpful was the step by step description of how the pieces were made, and drawn diagrams of how the pieces featured were put together. Also, there was a picture and description of use for more jewelrs tools than I knew existed. These sections made purchasing the book worthwhile."
4,"Great, but not for novices!!","This is a really good book for the most part. The photos are great as are the drawings. It goes into strong detail about how the pieces are created. The artist bios are interesting as well.This book is NOT for novices however. One would want to take atleast a couple college level jewelry classes (I'd suggest three) before trying out some of these designs. I'd also suggest working with less expensive materials (silver and copper) instead of gold. The instructions weren't quite as clear as I would have hoped, but once again they are geared towards professionals (or atleast someone with like knowledge).Other than that, the book is quite good. I would suggest everyone to have this in their jewelry library."
4,Project Based,"It is a wonderful opportunity for the metalsmith to practice lots of concepts from a Master. They sell a photocopy version at Revere"" until the new comes out, but it is a great book. Alan is a great teacher!"
3,Susan,"the quality of the tape wasn't the best--but it was good. work out was good--let's you do it at your pace. get a good workout. best to know something about weight lifting...it helps, but not needed."
3,Pool size,Be aware that this is a lot of chemical. I bought it for my spa which is 130 gallons so I should have enough chemical for the next 100 years.
1,This Game Sucks,"This game was for my six year old daughter who saw the cover and thought it was cute.Plus she was excited that it comes with bonus games.She played with this game twice trying to make herself like it since she she used her own money for the purchase.the point of the game is you get to pick how many animals you want to raise and then your supposed to train them and take care of them.but she never got to the training part because you can only take a few steps before it needs to eat,drink,shower,use the bathroom,or play all random.Everyone in the family tried this game and we all agree that it sucks.Save your money and go for the bratz pony game or the petz games."
5,"Good Razors, very good value.","These give a very clean shave, and are MUCH lower priced than the stores. Also, these razors seem to last longer than cheaper brands. I can get about 8-10 shaves out of one razor, which is a lot better than double blade razors."
3,"Before Spider-Man, There Was 'Crimewave'","An anachronistic, over-the-top live action cartoon. The film has a constant, silly tone that may irritate some, and others may find very charming. All the actors ham it up, Sam Raimi rips off classic Looney Tunes moments left and right, and the sets and costumes (seeming to run the gamut from the 20's, through the 50's, but anchored in the 80's) create a surreal feel. An interesting, different comedy"
1,You've Gotta Be Kidding Me,"There's a chance the nonstop idiocy of Crimewave might appeal to the lowest of lowbrow sensibilities. Sure, stylistically there's probably nothing else quite like it, but why would there be? For most who would choose to engage their cerebra, this piece of nearly incomprehensible cartoony trash is clearly a product of gung ho mis-inspiration on the part of Raimi and the Coen Brothers fed by too much available talent and money...and possibly chemicals.That this was shot in my hometown of Detroit compelled me to watch to the bitter end; at least I got to see the Belle Isle Bridge."
1,Awful,"What, exactly, was the point of this book? While I can appreciate the difficulties the author faced, the book felt like sitting through a bad therapy session."
1,Don't buy if you own a Mac.,"I bought this product as a Chritsmas present for my daughter. Talk about a disappointment. The product is cheaply made. Says Mac compatible on the packaging. What they fail to mention is that if you buy songs from the itunes music store and try to put them on the FY400, the player won't play songs in that format. And, if you drag songs that you have imported into itunes (not purchased on the music store) on to the fy400, the songs show up twice on the song list in the player. I tried mpio tech support and they were absolutely no help. Frustrating, to say the least."
1,one star is too many,"don't listen to the diehardssave your moneyif this record had come out maybe 10 years ago it might be worthwhile but considering what these gentlemen have done since then, this record is sorry - the only reason anyone buys it is out of loyalty - the only reason they like it is because they paid for it and it's difficult to find any decent commercial music right nowthis is the patton/denison/stanier/rutmanis equivalent to metallica's black album - stale, boring and not half as good as anything they've done before - let's hope they don't continue (...) like metallica has..."
2,Mike Patton eating steak,"Maybe if I hadn't heard Mike Patton's brilliance in Angel Dust or Disco Volante, I could enjoy this album as dirty slime rock. But I have heard him do far better, and this is a disappointment.The vocals on this album have two directions: low snearing growls and yelps. That's it. It sounds like Mike Patton is trying to start bar fights, and although that may fit in the theme of the album, it doesn't do much for the listener except make him/her think that Patton is a meathead shoving people around. Gone are the complex vocal melodies and depth that made him a cult legend, here we see him riding on the coattails of former work while he builds a reputation as an indie businessman instead of musician.It's sad to see your heroes fall from grace, especially when they're only in their early 30's and have so much left to give. I hope the macho wears off soon."
1,"Trying too hard to be ""creative.""","i must admit that i havent listened to this album. but, however, i have seen them live very recently, and they were really annoying. it semmed like mike patton was just trying his hardest to seem like a creative genious, he was flailing around making noises with his mouth. wow, anyone can do that. as a matter of fact, i think i will put out a record like this and soon i will be hailed as a creative genious. keep an eye out for me!"
3,"fun, but tedious patton record.","Tomahawk's release won't put them at the top of the pop charts any time soon, nor do they really have any intention of being there. fans of singer mike patton's earlier work (the oft overlooked faith no more and mr. bungle) will likely gravitate towards this record as i did. all other's may want to be a little more wary. first, off gone are the hooks of faith no more and the sonic mish mash of mr. bungle. in it's place, on tomahawk's record, is a rather odd hybrid of the two. for the most part, it works really well and i doubt any of fans of patton's would be disappointed. i first heard of the band when i saw them open for tool. their stage show was quite impressive and energetic. unfortunately, most of that energy is lost on the studio recording. however, if your new to patton's delightfully eclectic songwriting steer yourself towards something else. overall, the songs are fun, but tedious at times. for what it's worth, i liked it."
4,"Oh, now I get it.","The first listen in the car had me thinking it was a pretty good rock record. I usually pick up most Bungler stuff and it was cool to hear Patton flexing some more melodic muscles. But the more I listen to this the more I realize how complicated it really is. Don't let the rock veneer fool you, this is weird, dark music, much more sophisticated than I thought after the first time through. In this sense, it's a little like California. It doesn't sound a thing like it, but the freakiness only becomes apparent after you've given it a little time to ripen. Also, `Point and Click' sounds a little like Live Skull, and it's been a helluva long time since I've heard anything with that particular influence that was any good."
2,At least I think I like music...,"This album is quite a disappointment, especially after Fantomas. I had high hopes for this other ""supergroup"" of Patton's, but it was for naught. This album sounds like FNM's ""Album of the Year"" (admit it, that one sucked hard), but not quite that bad. Basically, bland, uninspired, uninventive, yet competant hard rock, which is sad because I know Patton can do better. I can't believe that anyone who's listened to and enjoyed ""Disco Volante"", ""Fantomas"", ""The Director's Cut"", ""California"", ""Mr. Bungle"", ""Adult Themes for Voice"", ""Panzo Oltranzista"", and even the barely-listenable-but-admirable Maldoror album, not to mention the majestic ""Angel Dust"" and the less majestic but still rockin ""The Real Thing"" and ""King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime"", could be the least bit impressed by this extremely unforgettable material."
2,Blech.,"Weak effort. I was looking forward to a rock record from Mike Patton, but what we have here is 13 songs that sound similar and have the same distorted whispered lyrics. Weak guitar tones. The only thing that saves it is good production. Dissapointing."
2,blah....,"I'm a big fan of Bungle, Secret Chiefs and FNM's Angel Dust and King for a Day (only) albums, but this is just not good music right here... Patton's vox are annoying and constant, like a hyper active 5 year old whose mommy didn't give him enough attention... the band is competent, but about as distinct as Limp Bisquick, and most importantly, the songs are just pathetic: lame metal riffs, no hooks, and pointless time signature changes that only serve to call attention to the dearth of clever musical ideas... sounds like it was written and recorded in a hurry.boo."
2,dissapointing,"im a huge mike patton fan, i have all but one of the mr bungle cds, his stuff with dillinger escape plan, lovage, and of course the incredible faith no more. so when i heard that patton also starred in tomahawk i rushed to the store and bought it, having really high hopes. after the end of...say, the 3rd song, i just pressed stop on my cd player, i havent listened to it since. i dont know how to explain it, patton just doesnt seem all energetic and crazy like he usually does, and even if he did get to his usual self, the music behind it is boring and doesnt compare (or match) to patton's voice. im sorry, im a huge fan of patton and his work, but if you are a patton fan like myself i would suggest to pass this one up because it is probably the only flaw in his whole career."
3,Charles Whitman!?,"i saw this band with tool in Austin, Tx, and i was looking forward to any band juxtaposed with TOOL!.. so i tried to give them a chance but i liked these guys better with their proceeding bands. I liked the energy and screeches of Mr. Patton, But live, these shrieks sound a lot alike from song to song. The studio quality of a CD makes listening to this band more worth it. And love em or hate em, it's hard to forget a band that gets the place to chant ""Charles Whitman Charles Whitman"", especially in Austin!"
3,More like 3.5 stars,"First off, I love just about all of Mike Patton's work. I think he is one of the best persons in music today and will prove to be one of the most significant musician's of our time. Tomahawk's self titled release is a pretty good album. It's more mainstream then any thing Mr. Patton has put out in quite some time. It's an enjoyable album just because it's a strait forward rock album with a little Patton. Tomahawk's first album proves to be a nice intro to what this band could be. The fourth track, ""God Hates a Coward"" is one of the best rock songs I have heard in a while. The opening track ""Flashback"" is pretty good as well, while not as hard hitting as #4. The only other significant songs are ""Pop 1,"" ""Jockstrap,"" and ""Sir, Yes Sir."" The rest of the album is ok. None of the songs are awful or great, but there is a good vibe coming off this new group."
5,This Beat Could Win Me The Grammy!,"Aaah, my man Mike Patton. Erstwhile Faith No More frontman (and Grammy winner) and fulltime iconoclast, he has finally turned his attention somewhere in between the (relatively) straight-up riffing of Faith No More and the outright counterculture fetishism of Fantomas and come up with an excellent substitue for Ritalin.Tomahawk is a sort of avant-garde alternative rock messiah, and something the Amercian music scene really needs right now....take the lyrical and theatrical post-modern absurdity of Radiohead, add a dash of Primus, and give it a boot in the rear and you would be close. If you like the sardonic surrealism of The Mars Volta without all the masturbatory B.S., this is the band for you. And it rocks. All ambulatory bipedal neo-primates are hereby ordered to purchase as many copies as possible of this CD. One of the best releases of the 21st century. There, I said it (laughs)."
4,Tomahawk Strong,"Very solid effort from Patton & Co. Hope to hear more in the future. Going to see them open for Tool soon, very high expectations. Buy it now if you weren't smart enough to do so already!"
3,Patton and the sideshow supergroup,"Like with most post-FTM projects, this one is plagued with great ideas festering around weaker rock occurences, smelling of desperate menace. With enough vocal prowess to guide some consistently clever instrumental outbursts, Tomahawk's first release just cuts it."
4,It's a Tomahawk album not Faith no More,"If anyone describes, or compares this to a faith no more album should be ashamed of themselves for even having such an ignorant thought. Faith no More is gone and people looking for filler to relive the greif should not go out and compare everything to them. This is very angry music and not everyone will like it, there will be no ""hits"" from it, and it is for a very select few."
1,The REPRINTED Art of Frank Miller,"I saw this in a comic book store and boy, was this a disappointment. Most of the material has appeared in the pages of the Sin City comic books. Here, they're reproduced at a larger size but big deal. Compare this to the recent Art of Hellboy and you'll see a huge difference in terms of value. Do not buy this book if you already own the Sin City comics or graphic novels because you're going to be getting something you've already seen."
4,Inspiration,"This film is for those of us who like to see what the pros can do on their bikes...it definitely makes you want to get out and pull some cool tricks as well. If you're looking for a film with no acting talent that brings humour and cool tricks, this film is it."
1,Boring,"Compared to ""New World Disorder"" this one looks like a ""sunday afternoon family mountainbike trip with your mom and dad"". It is the most boring film I have seen in a long time. Dont do the same mistake like me and buy this one - go for the must see ""New World Disorder"" instead!"
3,"Dylan's return to simplicity has some good, some bad","A quiet, reflective Dylan penned these songs following his disastrous motorcycle accident--obviously a major influence on this cd. Dylan returns to the folk that made him so popular at Monterey, et. al., and the album personifies the traditional anguish of Dylan. On the whole, the album is respectable, but hardly a masterpiece. Dylan's voice sounds better than it does on almost any other album, but the lyrics do not carry as much power as other works. Of course, two seminal works--""All Along the Watch Tower"" and ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight""--appear on this album, but the rest of the work is a little thin."
5,Speechless,"Words cannot explain the beauty and grace of this American Masterpiece.Sit back, relax and enjoy.Thanks Robert."
4,Good Songs Don't Always Equal A Strong Album,"The songs on this album are strong and anjoyable. Biblically stark and understated, the songs are a distinct contrast to Dylan's earlier effort to be taken seriously as a rock-and-roller. Hearing the original version of ""All Along the Watchtower"" is enough to make it worthwhile. However, put together, they become somewhat repetetive -- the instrumentation varies little from one song to the next, and they're all pllayed in the same shambling manner. As the critical review indicates, Dylan may have lacked some confidence after two years away -- nothing to a good artist nowadays, but back then, when albums came out every six months, that must have seemed an eternity. This album is probably best for making a mix tape with alternative-country artists who have drawn their influences from here -- Townes Van Zandt, Kelly Willis, Jimmy Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock, Iris DeMent, and Marty Brown among others."
4,a let down from earlier albums but still good,"i dont know who john wesley hardung is but he must be somebody because nes got an album named after him.ill cut right to it.this album is pretty average in comparison to anything hed done by 1967 with 2 glaring exceptions......they are ""all along the watchtower"" which is a great great song"".jimi hendrix who is a fellow musical genius covered that one and the other is the love song ""ill be your baby tonight"".pretty plain and slower than you may be used to."
5,Perhaps Dylan's Best,"I'm not sure how any of the previous reviewers could say that this record is ""a little thin,"" or ""doesn't have much music."" While they are entitled to their opinion, perhaps these people do not understand the true depth of this record. Every song is an experience unlike any you will find in music today. If you listen, late at night, with the rain pounding outside, you might begin to understand what this music is all about. Dylan is in his best voice here, and although not the most famous of his albums, it is one of those rare recordings that might change your life. Stunningly beautiful, biblical, and often uplifting, John Wesley Harding is Dylan's best."
5,"an odd, detached bob","dylan's all spooky here -- otherwordly, shadowy, and ultra-mysterious. he taps you on the shoulder and then disappears. at least you think it was him...."
4,He's leaning toward his country phase,"Bob's second to last studio album of the 60's is very different from anything previous. You can hear him steer clear of the blues influences that saturated his earlier electric output. His voice is maturing from his unmistakeable whine, to more of a, well, traditional singing voice. Definately not as raw or powerful as his earlier stuff, but laid back and introspective. Not to be missed if ya love the man."
1,UGH,"My little sister bought this, and all I have to say is that the people who wrote the story clearly did not read the book at all. The story was absolutely massacred. The scrapbook was worthless too. Do not waste your money on this peice of crap."
4,Odd Couple,I cant believe the quality of the picture.This is from 1970-1973.I saw an episode on T.V. recently and it wasn't as clear as this.Brings back a lot of memories.its too bad we lost both Jack Klugman and Tony Randall.(Tony's real name was Arthur Rosenberg)
5,Classic!!!,Great DVD! Wish we were able to watch this on todays TV line up... brings us back to the good old days.
3,Lovely photos!,"I was a little bit disapointted the book had not much text. Of course it was nice to read the other's opinions about Diana with lovely photos, but as a big fan I expected more. A beautiful book to look at, I would say."
2,Not impressed....,"From the website picture, it appears to be a classic, simple. unpretentious guest book. I thought it would be a nice touch for our wedding guest book as we were not in to the satin finishes, bows and peacock feathers that were adorning others wedding guest books. When I opened it, I saw it was essentially a spiral notebook for signatures. I wound up returning the item in search of a guest book that had a little more pizazz. Also, it is fairly small in size; another dealer breaker."
5,Route 66: The Mother Road,"Very fast shipping and the item was in excellent shape, nearly like new. The book is of a high quality paper and cover. Lots of excellent pictures and information. Excellent job by the author!"
5,Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition,"Excellent product, perfect condition and the shipping was faster than expected. I would trust this selleragain. THe book is an interesting read and enjoyed learning more about Route 66. We plan on doingthis adventure, only decision is use a 60's car, motorhome or newer car. Oh my, isn't life tough? Somany things to be thankful for."
4,Mother Road,"This book was one of the inspirations for the Disney/Pixar movie ""Cars,"" which was a cute bit of fun. This book was revealing and thoroughly enjoyable as a bit of heart-tweaking nostalgia. I became interested in pre-Interstate maps years ago and began collecting as much as I could about what US highways were like before the advent of the National Interstate System. This book will make you want to get away from the boringly hypnotic drives on the interstates, and take a few old highways and byways to see some things from days gone by, interact with small towns that grew up along these highways other than seeing the names as exit signs on the Interstate. This book contains a wealth of information about Route 66, and makes a very good introduction to a study of that road, and could inspire one to look at other old Federal highways that have seen much better days."
5,An excellent read,"Especially if you are old enough to remember, or just like to visit the past...Many good memories were there for me, as we travelled 66 many times in the 40's and 50's."
4,Route 66: The Mother Road,"Purchased this book for my husband. Author plays the Sheriff character in ""Cars"". (Husband's favorite character in the movie.) Book is packed with information and great pictures. Helpful for planning a trip along the route."
2,How someone else's compiler works piece by piece...,"This book does show you how a compiler is implemented, literally. The author has a compiler already coded which he breaks down piece by piece and shows you how the pieces work.Unfortunately, instead of only giving you what you need to know for a specific piece, alot of future material is added too soon because it's already in the code. What would've been good is to trim out that stuff and give examples of code that wasn't part of the complete compiler but explained a specific point and only that point.Too much time is spent explaining pre-existing code that implements the modules in a ready-built compiler, and not enough time is spent describing what each module in a compiler is supposed to do and how you'd do it yourself or alternative ways of implementing functionality.If only there was a compiler book that was halfway between this one and the Dragon book..."
1,"Poorly constructed, and teeming with errors.","Considering the nature of the text, I find it most peculiar that Mr Appel doesn't own a java compiler. For if he did he surely would have found, and corrected, the teeming mass of errors that is his example java code throughout the book. After paying an exorbitant price in excess of NZ$100 for such a sadly dissapointing text, I can only recommend that Mr Appel check his example code with increased vigour in the future."
1,Please don't buy it!,"If you are a genius at writing compilers without ever needing a book, go ahead buy this book. If you want to learn something, please buy the book by Aho, Ullman and Sethi. I bought this book as part of course requirement and found it to be absolutely useless. The author doesn't care to explain anything and his programming exercises are the vaguest. Might be good if you have too much money to splurge.I think it is recommended in the universities because of the support tools JLex and CUP, the documentation of which is again more pathetic!"
4,Good book... but watch out for errors!,Concise introduction to compile design. There are around 50 errors in this 500-page work. So be sure to check the errata list.
1,Poorly written,"I was drawn by the word ""modern"" in the title, but I found nothing useful in this book. The author summarizes to the point that the text contains too little information. Perhaps it's useful as the first two weeks of an intro to compiler design undergrad course, but entirely useless to anyone who actually wants to build a compiler. This book is not even a good supplement and is not worth the purchase price."
1,An absolute waste of paper,"Andrew Appel's textbook (Modern Compiler implementation in Java) has been prescribed as a Course Textbook. Given a choice, I strongly recommend to take it from the library or any place where you can get it for free for one semester/quarter. This book is not worth the money and is an absolute waste. Not only does it not teach you anything about compilers, but if you already know something, then it serves to confuse you.The author has tried to explain things using an example and ""steps"" through the process of writing a compiler. So in that sense, if you are just looking to write a compiler and be done with it whether you understand it or not, then this book might be considered OK, though not good in any sense.No theory about compilers is explained and the author seems to be talking to himself throughout the text."
2,Read this only if your discrete math is current,"I picked up this book because I like Java and it looked like it would be easy to understand but still concise. I was wrong. It is too terse. There is not enough explanation unless you already understand the subject and/or know a lot about set theory and notation. Unless your knowledge of discrete math is quite strong, I can't say that I recommend it. Instead, I would recommend Compilers, Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Alfred Aho. It is much easier to read than Mr. Appel's book."
2,Vague at Best.,"I've read through several compiler texts over the past few months as I work away on a compilers project for school. I would have to say that this text, the required textbook for my class, is not in the least bit useful. Most of the material in the book is not covered in any real depth. If you are looking for a useful book on compilers, I would recomend ""Compilers"" by Aho, Sethi and Ulman (the Dragon Book), or ""Crafting a Compiler"" by Fisher and LeBlanc. Both books are much more thorough. The Fisher's book is also quite easy to read and understand. Appel's books only saving grace is the occasional modern view of things."
2,Not a good general compiler book,"I used this as one of three textbooks for an undergraduate compiler class I taught at MIT (the other two were the Dragon book and Muchnick). This one was universally considered the least useful. We used it principally as a guide to writing the lexical analyzer and parser, since our class also used JLex and CUP.After that initial stage, it walks through the construction of a compiler, but without much discussion of the range of design choices avaliable. The material on optimization is uninspiring."
1,"Need definition of ""confusing"" ?","Designing and implementing a reasonable compiler is a fairly masochistic activity. But this book makes it much worse. Poorly written, awfully confusing this book presents a spaghetti of java classes without even a slightest attempt to clarify the concepts or create any general understanding of the subject.While painfully struggling through this mess I was under the impression that the author was writing it on the side of napkins during lunch. And never reread what he wrote.To make it even worse the book is full of errors, and bugs in code examples. Publishing this mess is a disrespect to readers (and students who might be so unlucky as to have this for a course textbook) I do not know if there is anything better available, but this is unacceptable."
3,Not Up-to-Date,"This edition referes to ""the 90s"". Many items listed are no longer available or contact information has chaned. Need an edition for the 2000s!"
4,I love Sister Cecile,"Winona Sullivan hooked me with A Sudden Death at the Norfolk Cafe, and kept me interested as Cecile and the nuns headed south. I enjoyed Saving Death in particular because this novel provided some backstory about Cecile's youth and her relationship with Paul - though it was not important to the meat of the mystery, I liked it nonetheless. I'm comfortable with these characters and I enjoyed learning more about them.Cecile's assignment is to solve a twenty-year-old murder where many of the people involved are either dead or unwilling to talk. Her client, unknown to her, was the man wrongly convicted of the crime, and though he changes his mind at one point Cecile is determined to find closure to this case, before the true killer gets to her first. All in all an enjoyable read."
4,Surprising Gem,"Gavaler is a fine technician of the language, has an eye for detail, a keen sense of humor, a snappy writing style. I loved his characters, especially Ashley, the heroine. But they are all well drawn. Like other reviewers I believe the book was mis-categorized. It's light on the romance (not necessarily a bad thing)and heavy on action and derring-do. I enjoyed the plot's twists and turns. Mystery/thriller better describes this book. Shouldn't it have been issued as a hardback, rather than a checkout counter book? It is surely at least as good as most thrillers published these days.All in all a worthy first effort. I'd like to see more from this author."
5,Catches everything!,"Are you sick of those cheap fiberglass filters that do practically nothing? I was too! Especially since we just had a baby and we wanted the best air possible. These trap things you never even knew you were breathing in or recycling through the system of you central air. We have 2 cats, 1 dog, 2 adults and 1 baby so you can imagine whats flying around! If you are serious about breathing CLEAN air, get this. Otherwise you can keeps breathing in particles of fiberglass from those cheapo filters!"
4,yes,Its wirth the wait .I searched for years then it was here yes to amizon good show wish it had more songs 3 great ones
2,"Pete Maravich - ""Homework Basketball: Shooting","When I finally received my DVD, It wouldn't play. I'm in the process of returning the DVD and having my money returned."
1,interesting but treading old ground.,"Certainly the theme of Ruggiero's work is convincing. However this book reveals nothing new, and saftely treads through the old predujuices seeking to lay entire blame on the shoulders of Chamberlain. The work is convincing in this aim, only if you fail to take a step back from the argument. As with all historical works it is important to have a look in the authors other hand, the one behind his back. It is here that the authors own preconceptions fanish and the truth is clearer. Opinions on History cannot be wholly lifted from one source, and it is important to examine historians who feel different to Ruggiero if a whole understanding is to be gleemed on the topic. Roggerio work is very powerful, but with all my reading around this subject there is nothing in it that I have not heard before, ultimately it is nothing but a refined ""guilty men""."
1,totally stinks,"this movie is the worst ever! the werewolf looks fake the movie it self makes no sense.If you want good werewolf flicks see american werewolf in london,american werewolf in paris or the old universal movie the wolf man."
1,the MOST STUPID movie in the world!,"Don't waste your time to watch this movie.stupid acting, stupid make-up. Even the werewolf itselfwill say ""WHAT A WASTE OF MY TALENT TO SCARE PEOPLE!"" HA HA HA!"
1,War Wilf,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you must watch it, try to watch the MST3K version. It is so ridiculous in every way. Bad everything."
1,"New cover, same bad movie.","This always was a bad movie. I was hoping the DVD would have interviews or behind the scenes (They must have been hilarious). Sadly it does not. Unsuspecting viewers will be fooled by the photoshopy cover on the DVD and the words ""Gold edition"" (which by the way is the same as the VHS edition only this time it says ""Gold Edition""). Don't judge a book by it's cover: this one's a stinker."
2,Well......,"It's hard to give an unbiast review of this movie after seeing it on MST3K, but I'll try to act as if I saw it comment free. It starts out at an archaelogical dig in Arizona, where the skeleton of a werewolf is unearthed. This starts a chain reaction of werewolves terrorizing the town. In an odd casting move, Martin Sheen's brother Joe Estevez appears early in the film and then seems to disappear! Anyway, eventually, the entire cast seems to be replaced by foreign actors, who can't act and can barely speak! While the make-up on nearly transformed werewolves isn't too bad, the continue to change until becoming ridiculous Halloween mask style creatures with bear bodies. A few scenes in this movie aren't bad, but they are so small, so few. I can't recommend it unless it's on MST3K, because it was the best MST3K I've seen so far."
1,Phew!,"This movie was so bad, I don't think even MST3K would find anything funny about it. It totally stunk. The fight scene was laughable, you could see their punches didn't connect, not even close to connecting. The chase scene with the woman and the ""werewolf"" was laughable. The dubbing was pathetic. It doesn't deserve to have the name of werewolf its cover. If ya want to see a decent movie, see The Howling vol 1. That is the best, even through the others are somewhat bad, they arent as bad as this movie."
2,"Rest in... Beast, Ugh","I saw this on MST3K, and I must say, WOW. I have seen some terrible movies in my short life, but, WOW. The only way I could describe Werewolf is as a cross between Howling 3 and The Room. And while the sheer silliness of the movie keeps it from being the worst werewolf movie of all time (that little honor goes to Howling 2), it still will leave many in pain. Though, to be fair, I kinda enjoyed it."
1,NO STARS REALLY,"Horribly abysmal, mindless, poorly acted, directed, written, you name it..this movie is so bad, it's not even funny!!!!! Avoid at all costs!"
2,The Pain Train,"This film is known as the pain train. So bad it hurts. It'll make you chuckle a bit, but it's certainly not worth paying 10 bucks for unless you get the MST3K version. That version is truly hilarious.Here's a list of things to laugh at, whether you're watching the original or the MST3K version -Fighting ArchaeologistsForeign AccentsWolf Hand PuppetsDirectors Playing Security Guards And Turning Into WerewolvesInexplicable Gun-toting Bearded MenBob Villa Look-a-likes Being Killed By WerewolvesJoe Estevez"
1,screw the director gently with a chainsaw,It says a lot for a film when the first time you see it is on Mystery Science Theatre 3000... and you can't even bring yourself to watch the entire episode because film is the worst they've ever shown.
1,You MUST be kidding me.,"How could the filmmakers responsible for this silly piece of trash have believed that it was good in ANY way? It's boring, not scary, poorly acted and has a ridiculous non-ending. At least Plan 9 from Outer Space was FUNNY."
3,So bad it's funny??? I think so.....,"I saw this when MST3K did it on the Sci-Fi Channel and it ranks right up there with MANOS-THE HANDS OF FATE.I couldn't believe the mistakes and the inept filmmaking going on...This is one werewolf movie you can't take seriously,so either you'll laugh at it or hate it....I rented the movie after I saw MST3K do it just to see what it was like without the riffs and believe me,you need the riffs! Not unless you make some of your own...Do I recommend it??Well,if you love bad movies,yes! But,if not,rent it and see for yourself!!"
5,the greatest punk cd to own ever,"this cd is one of the greatest cd's i own. Why do I say this because Brandon Thomas(vocal) is a man that knows how to sing and his voice talent is truly shown in this cd. Dave Aguilera (guitarist, Keith Thompson (bass and vocals) and Scott Gottlieb (Drummer)all have tremendous talent and make this cd awesome. When you buy this CD keep in mind that tragically Scott Gottlieb passed away just before the release of this cd due to cancer and he checked himself out of the hospital just to record on this masterpiece of CD's. Now if you don't that ain't a true musician than you shouldn't be listening to any music at all."
1,man oh man can you be any less original??,"Im only 11 and my first thought on this cd was wow this cd was wow its okay its no used or nothing but then i listened to it again, this band is the used. and the used is horrendous. this band just ""rides the wings of pesitlence"" no pun intended. There is no blast beats and this cd just creates a miasmic sound and not the pleasant kind that the black dahlia murder makes. i rather sacrifice my mother than listen to this cd."
4,Built from a Dream,"Bleed the Dream - Built by Blood is a must have for anyone who is into this type of music. For an ""underground"" band, they sure have the sounds of a band that's been doing this for many years. All the different sounds (the guitars, the bass, the drums, the singing and screaming vocals), all match up and flow perfectly with one another. I first saw them at Taste of Chaos 2005 with their acoustic set, and they were the only acoustic performance that I enjoyed. Not only that, but I got to meet the band when I dislocated my shoulder. They were hanging out in the First Aid room, keeping smiles on all the injured fans. It goes to show that they are real people with real feelings. I gained a lot of respect for them."
1,Displeased.,"Though I gave the specifics of my vehicle which is a Kia Sorento 2004, the harness was incorrect. The CD/DVD Player did not work for more than 4 days. I have since returned the item and I am awaiting the new one which was shipped to me. In addition, no one asked if i would like to have the same CD/DVD player or if I would prefer a different name brand or style. In regards to the harness, I bought the correct one from E-Bay. I guess that upon receipt and connection of the new player, I will be able to rate it at a later date."
4,Very helpful,It has many helpful examples and it makes the subject easy to learn. I didn't read most of the text though. I mainly liked it for it's clear and well explained examples.
4,Good Book.,Explanations are satisfactory although a bit more clarity could be appreciated in terms of the logic behind some of the processes that are being used. The problems are extremely helpful in clarifying the subject matter and for review.
3,Didn't use at all,"bought this book for a statistics economics class. however, we didn't use the book at all besides the inside cover of the page, which was a chart to determine probability. i tried reading this book to help me through that class, but i also did not find it of much use either. the descriptions were somewhat vague in my opinion and there were not enough examples for me to understand the concepts."
5,I'm free!!!,"THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!Finally someting to listen to that has music, thought, and excitement. I wish more people were exposed to Ice Age and prog. It is a shame you can't find this on the radio, at least in New York City.The insturmentals are monumental (Musical Cages) and the lyrics (When you are Ready) are superb. Ice Age has given us a ""free"" gift with a little something for eveyone. And Tong-Len (The Last Track) reminds me of something from ""The Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" soundtrack!!"
3,an improvement on all fronts,"The second album from NYC's Ice Age is much better than their first. They've scaled back the pomp and bombast and guitarist Jimmy Pappas isn't as concerned with showing off how good he is. It's all around more tuneful and heartfelt. ""The Lhasa Road"" is as good as political science statement as prog can make, and it's probably the best song these guys have done yet. It's still a bit samey in spots, but it's definitely a strong second showing. The next album should be a killer."
3,"Clunky, but the origin of greatness","The Wind from Nowhere is a rather silly novel with poorly drawn characters and a truly absurd antagonist. Fortunately Ballard's single-minded focus on the scenario, a focus he'd go on to hone into incredible masterworks, manages to keep things interesting. Even the final act, where we finally meet the antagonist, is a riot act of hubris undone. I can understand why Ballard rejected this novel, but it's great fun to start here and read him in chronological order. By the time you get to Crash your brain will be subtly changed."
1,its so funny that it's not funny,"i gave the series a try and now wonder why. people say it's all about fan service, that starts even in the opening song, but it is all bad jokes or sexual play. bloody noses and blushed cheeks are the name of this game. i have seen many animes that use humor or sexual jokes that have at least some kind of story line but this one has nothing else going for it."
4,surprising,im surprised to see that they released this show in america considering how risque it is. can be extremely funny however. not recommended for anyone under high school age.
2,"Just ""Blah""","I had Green Green reccomended to me by a friend, and it wasn't at all what she had made it out to be. I sat through the whole series at his request, but never fully came around to enjoying it.The plot is simple: a group of girls go to an all-boys boarding school as a test for a co-ed school. Of course, chaos ensues when the boys see all of the pretty girls getting off the bus. There are supposed plotlines somewhere in this piece, but they were there to try (and fail) to make this piece more than simply fanservice.If you're looking for a lot of ecchi set in a mindless harem piece, then Green Green might be what you're looking for. It's few redeeming points might be its risque, but sometimes entertaining humor, and one particular character who I came to like. But if you want something with a plot and characters you care about, you might want to look elsewhere."
2,"Disharmonious ""Harmony""","Of the 3 Edsel repackages, this pairing of ""Captured Live At The Forum"" and ""Harmony"" is alternately just okay and then horrible. The reproduction of the audio from the live album is very boxy in quality, although part of this may be due to the circumstances of the era it was recorded (1969). However there can not be any excuses for the ridiculous extended edits performed on several songs from ""Harmony,"" including ""Never Been To Spain,"" ""My Impersonal Life,"" & ""Jam,"" where for some unknown reason pieces of the songs in question have been edited back in a second time in order to lengthen their running time - a complete unneeded travesty! Plus ""My Impersonal Life"" also leads off with obvious tape warble issues. Exceptionally substandard. Look for the original MCA cd issues."
2,not worth it,"This book reflects the philosophy and practices of the former IP technology organization at AT&T. The final outcome of the group was supposed to be a versatile middleware platform (code-named Geoplex) underlying and integrating data and voice operations in the AT&T networks (and BT in England as well). Geoplex failed miserably for a variety of reasons (not least, ill-defined focus). If anything, that is a bad rap for the book and its approach. But credibility is not everything, and this could still be a well written book. Still, I found it too long and rich in technical details. What was up-to-date two years ago is now obsolete. My advice is to browse through the copy available at your library."
5,Innovative large software,"I read the published book and before that a draft Professor Lerner gave to his CS students. The book is clear and polished far beyond the draft. I guess Professor listened to his students' comments. Cool. It really got me much more into the ideas and the nuts-and-bolts. The technology seems pretty aggressive, like a totally new kind of a telephone except doing everything in one system, and for lots of companies too. Like Napster for doing anything. Does someone have a CD of the whole system? That would have been a nice thing to add into the book."
3,Discard The First Two Novellas and You've Got A Decent Story,"Having read the necessary (all) novels before, I was both excited and sad for the last of the Skye's Legacy novels.Frankly, I was tired of Fancy and Diana before the twentieth page. I found myself re-reading Cyn and Wickedness many times before and wishing that Small had discarded the other two novellas and focused solely on Cynara and Harry. Cynara has the fire and headstrongness I had been looking for in previous novels. Although I thought Harry was a bit eaten up with guilt, he was a decent hero(?). I keep comparing him to men like Geoffrey Southwood and Adam de Marisco, who would've taken what they wanted and to hell with the consequences. Still, at least the series ended on a somewhat high note, considering the wreckage that came before."
3,A little below Expectations,As a Finale to The Skye saga and legacy this book gets the job done and has Bertrice's usual flair. However the choppy three book style is a bit irritating. The first story of Fancy Devers and her level headed acquiescence to a lusty kings will is disturbing. Equally bothersome is how quickly love grows between her and her arranged match. It seems her story wraps far to quickly after giving birth to a King's bastard. The following two books are more readable but a little short. A good read but the book lacks importance if you haven't read the saga and the legacy.
3,It's a book from Ms. Small and I am grateful for that....,"I am always desparate for a new title from Ms. Small, and because this is a new title, I am grateful. It wraps up many ties to the past of Syke O'Malley and her great grand-daughters with some style and class, however, it is lacking in raw passion of Ms. Small's early works, and some of her latest ei...The Love Slave and Rosemund...can we all just forget about The Duchess? The first part devoted to Fancy Devers just is not enough, she (Ms. Small) could have written an entire book of Fancy, her first husband and his depravity, her royal lover and the consequences and I would have been very please. The second part of the book held my interest well enough with Diana and the twin brothers, but the later half of ""Cyn and Wickedness""was predictable. All in all a fair book I just wish for more substance, and Ms. Small is one author I expect it from."
5,Bertrice Small Vixens,"I liked this book because it did not contain an overwhelming number of sex scenes, the first novella was my favorite and the second one didn't have any sex at all. How disorienting for a Small. Lots of descriptions of what was worn to King Charles II's court and many descriptions of lunch usually ending with a wheel of hard cheese and a jug of brown ale. Holds up very well to the entire Small genre. Oh and um the book is about three cousins who can only be distinquished by a mole or lack of mole beneath the right or left nostril, all granddaughters of Jasmine the Moghul's daughter."
4,Two books in one.,The first half of the book was a blast to read. It moved right along and was very interesting. The second half of the book is much more technical. It reads more like a tech manual. Still a good read.
2,Going donwhill fast,"While her research is (as always) amazing, the series is going downhill fast. This book is BORING. Hundreds of pages of political soap opera with some action here and there. After 400 pages, I just can't suffer through it anymore. It's like flipping back and forth between reading transcripts of ""All My Children"" and the ""Congressional Record."" I bought the whole series as a set but I won't be finishing it.The quest for good historical fiction continues..."
4,Fairly good. Disappointment compared to First Man in Rome.,"Sulla's invasion of Italy and Pompey's character adds interest to the story, but Caesar's victory over Myteline and Pontus were rather bland. In any case, they're not as cool, exciting, noble, or capable as Gauis Marius. A big disappointment once you've read First Man in Rome."
2,"Tedious writing style, but pretty good historically","Far below the quality of the first two books. I read it mainly for the historical details since McCullough does seem to get her facts straight, but by the tenth time she used the phrases ""Fortune's Favorite"" or ""favored by fortune"" I was ready to puke. If only Robert Graves' skill at writing could be combined with McCullough's interest in historical truth!"
4,Wanna buy a clue?,"Looks like the others who wrote reviews here don't uderstand the point of Powers and Pantheons. It's supposed to be part of a trilogy of books that detail the Forgotten Realms pantheon, the third book being Demihuman Deities. If your characters run all over the Realms, then the whole series is recommended. If not, Faith and Avatars, and (probably) Demihuman Deities will be more than enough.My one gripe with the whole series is I don't think the specialty priests were playtested, or playtested enough. Some of them are overly powerful and can run roughshod over a campaign. To all DM's I caution, look carefully at the description of a particular specialty priest before allowing them to be PC's."
5,Excellent Work,"This book isn't on the same level as the Faiths and Avatars, but it is still excellent. If you like being or running campaigns that deal with a lot of differing beliefs (Think Avatar Triology) then this is a must have. The priests' abilities are a little more balanced than F&A. Also if you are in a campaign where a complaint is a cleric is only a cleric there are enough different shades of clerics to have fun. If your setting is in the jungles or Chult or outlands of Thay, or you would like them to be, this book details all of the religions of that region. But if you only want to buy one book on Forgotten Realms religions, buy Faiths and Avatars first."
4,great book,"Powers and Pantheons is a great book!, but I would buy the Faiths and Avatars book first. Powers and Pantheons is like a continued version of Faiths and Avatars, and it basicaly gives the information that Faiths and Avatars left out. So I suggest you get BOTH!!"
4,Covers general demi-gods/unther & Mulhorand dieties/temples,"Decently written text using the now standard deity format. Pictures are few, but the color plates of the priest's wardrobes are ok. The section on temples was nice. The maps very fun, and the detailing provides examples for one's own flushed out temples"
4,Playground of desire,"This is one of the great role - playing games: what else could one expect from johnathan tweet? (you know, the fellow who did 3D&D;). Its choice of setting - a corrupt island - state in the mediterrainian is inspired: the various shady expatriates who gather in such places can create all kinds of strange trouble. Especially when some of them come from lost civilizations and other worlds.This is NOT an illuminati conspiracy - theory spoof: the setting has strong internal consistency, and is derived from a more specific area of litterature than one would think from its open - ended nature: where beatnik and science fiction meet, giving birth to authors such as William Burroughs or Philip K. Dick. It has the kind of mythology suited to spies, drug addicts, the perverted, and space ghosts.Oh, and the system actually tells you to make whatever character you like. Dont worry though, it still uses hit points."
5,The New Complete German Shorthaired Pointer,Mr. McKowen picked up where C.D.Maxwell left off. This is the breed bible. Mr. McKowen's extensive experience and knowledge of the breed affords novice owners and people researching the breed with a wealth of valuable information. The book also provides veteran owners with a nicely organized reference. Required reading!
3,is what it is advertised as,This is a good book dealing with the origins of the breed.Very informative on champion and trial german shorthaired pointers.
5,Timeless! This CD will be beloved by many for years to come!,"I've been listening to Midnight Blue on tape since I was 8 years old. Anytime we'd go on vacation, it would be the first tape to be played. We played it so much, the tape actually broke! I've been trying in vain for at least 2 years to find a copy to replace the old one. Needless to say I was overjoyed to finally find it! It doesn't matter how old you are, or what kind of music you listen to - you will love this CD! Louise Tucker's voice is beautiful, and sometimes even haunting. Midnight Blue and Graveyard Angel are possibly two of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's such a shame that she never made anymore recordings. I suggest you pick up two copies - you're liable to wear this CD out!"
5,Loiuse Tucker UK website,"Thanks to those of you who wrote about the UK website. I just recieved both Midnight Blue and After the Storm from the site for the price of 30 Pound Sterling (around $60) for both discs. They are phenomenal and there is no need to pay $100 plus for one disc in the US. Why not support her website, maybe she will be inspired to produce another album!!!"
5,How can this album be out of print?,"Midnight Blue is simply one of the best albums ever!!!Songs such as: ""Only for you"" and ""Midnight Blue"" itself exemplify what musical excellence should be about. I innitially came accross the album at a friend's house and have been determined to acquire it ever since. It shows in perspective what I enjoy about 80s music and reject about the decade of the 90s and after."
3,"Good performance, bad audio","Sergio returns to his roots (as in The Swinger from Rio) with this live concert date, apparently from 1988. Sadly, the recording sounds almost like a bootleg, complete with distortion from time to time. As you see from the song list, he's playing mostly from the Great American Songbook, with his usual jazz-bossa approach. (Sometimes it sounds like he's channeling Vince Guaraldi, which is not a bad thing.) He's accompanied by a strong rhythm section and two uncredited wind players, a reed/flute player and trombonist. I like this album, despite the poor audio and lousy liner notes. For instance, as you can guess, cut #11 is actually Nica's Dream (Horace Silver). As a bonus, the last cut is the original Brasil '66 version of Mas Que Nada and has no connection with the rest of the album."
4,"Ok, but not As Good As His Newer Stuff","Since the listing doesn't show what songs Chris Orr's ""At His Feet"" cd contains, I'll post those below. My take on the cd is that it is above average but not great like his new stuff. If you have fallen in love with Chris Orr based on his new stuff (post 2005), then you may be disappointed with this disc, but if you could find it used for cheap, it may be worth it for you if you.The tracks are those which were very familiar and covered by lots of bands in the early 2000's:1. Let the River Flow2. We Fall Down3. I'm Trading My Sorrows4. We Will Worship the Lamb of Glory5. Open the Eyes of My Heart6. Holiness7. Be Glorified8. I Lay Me Down9. We Want to See Jesus Lifted High10. Because He Lives11. Can't Nobody"
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed that the book i ordered had several watermarks on the cover where someone had used it as a coaster. This was not included in the description. I don't buy a lot of book on line, so maybe this is typical for books rated ""good"", but it was disappointing none the less."
2,Bulge at 400miles,"Replaced at 400mi. due to a bulge. Inside wall was not broken, nevertheless..... I weigh 160 and only ride smooth asphalt."
2,Don't Bother,"This book had a couple decent ideas for Christmas decorations, but don't be fooled by the ""origami"" in the title. There were only a few standard origami models that you can find elsewhere just as easily (such as the Crane). Most of the rest of the models in the book were cut and paste types with a couple of folds. Over all, I was very disappointed with this book."
5,Origamu for Christmas,I had this book as kid.. lost it.. glad I find on amazon. I love to do origami as a hobby.. very nice Orgiami Rose in this book.. a Must for people who have Origami as a Hobby.. Iam happy to own book again in hard cover.
5,Great Skin,"The skin works great. Not only is it easy to install, but it improves the appearance of the Nintendo DS Lite while also protecting it from any scratches. The screen protectors included were also a bonus and one that are as necessary as the skin itself. It didn't take that long to place on the handheld console, and even if you didn't do it right the first time, you could still fix the problem by taking it off and doing it again."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this because it looked cool, but also because it came with some screen protectors. The screen protectors are working wonderfully, but the cover skin that goes on the outside keeps peeling away from the DS. The outside piece has three flaps that go over onto the sides of the back cover and those are not sticking very well. I've tried cleaning it, I've tried cleaning the DS right at the problem areas but no luck. I'm thinking at this point to taking the back cover of the skin off and trimming those side flaps so the skin is only on the back and not the sides of the back. Also, if you have the black DS you should know that this skin is really dark and doesn't look as good as it would on the white DS."
1,"Interesting Tests, Not Insightful Results","This book has some interesting tests to take-- how romantic are you? How much do you know about Sex? How aggressive are you?I was hoping to learn more about myself by taking these tests. The results on some tests are difficult to calculate. But once you muddle through and find your score - you are not really given a good explanation of what your results mean. It tells me very little about myself that I scored with the top 10 percent of those taking the test. I was hoping for explanations of what my answers say about me. This book lacks any deep thought-provoking explanations about your answers. I was hoping for it to say something about my personality. I was looking for more explanation into who I am based on the results of the tests. This book lacks the ""that's interesting"" factor from your test results. I was a bit disappointed by that. I took the tests and it seemed to reveal very little about the real me."
5,REALLY LOOKING INTO THE MIRROR,"Talk about self-responsibility and self-accountability. Here it is folks, a book of tests used by accredited psychologists to help you discover everything, well almost everything about yourself. These personality tests allow you to score or rate yourself and then guide you on how to change what you don't like. It's a step in the right direction and might give your career and love life a much needed boost. There are 25 tests. After you finish this book,look at ""How to Master Change"" by Mary Carroll Moore and ""35 Golden Keys to Who You Are and Why You're Here"" by Linda Anderson. Each book is a fine addendum to the other. No excuses now, let's put forth the effort and start getting our lives in order.First the self-tests, then action and transforming ourselves. Success and contentment are within our reach."
4,Great Vacuum,I found this to be a very good bargain at the reconditioned price. It assembled easily with just two screws and did an absolutely wonderful job cleaning carpet and an acceptable job cleaning flat surfaces. The waste container is easy to empty and the hose and attachments work well. The only reason I gave it a four is the weight. I'm not exactly a 90# weakling (quite the opposite) and can tell you that this vacuum will give you a workout in a bigger house.
3,Awesome music,"Okay album my favorites are Authenticity, T.H.C, and No Light. the song at the end was the one i was hoping they would have had on the album, Digital Bath by the deftones."
4,Great soundtrack...,"I like all the songs...However...does anyone know what the name of the song which opens up the during the Menu Selection which also plays during ""The New Club"" scene...I can't seem to find that song any where on the internet..."
2,digital bath is it?,"i do think they should have tried to get ""that"" song since anyone who saw that movie knows it's the best hands down. the band was smart enough to keep the song to their own album...clever band.me hearing that song made up for the pathetic ending of the film"
2,why no deftones?,i would of gave it five but they didnt put the best song on there Digital Bath by Deftones
1,Missing Song,The soundtrack didn't have my favorite song in the movie. I don't know the name of it but it was the song at the very end of the movie when the credits were playing. Could you please tell me the group who sings that song.
3,Riiiiiight! Dream on.,"Per the Product Description: ""More than 50 million Americans work at home and the work they do is as varied as the houses they live in."" Of them more than 49,999,000 do not have, nor will they ever have, home ""workspace"" approaching the elegance described in this book.If you have several hundred square feet for a ""workspace"" and several tens of thousands of dollars to devote to it, then this is the book for you. If, however, you are looking for practical ideas in setting up your ""workspace"" this isn't the book for you. The folks working at home in this book aren't your run of the mill home business types.If you want a coffee table book that has some pictures of beautiful ""workspaces"" then get it. It is totally unrealistic for the ""more than 50 million""!"
4,Wider spectrum of ideas,The book shows for each different necessity a very good solution with simplies and also clevers recommendations. Fotoghaphy is good and was well suited selected.
3,Not the best but not that bad either...,"As a big Shakira fan I bought this book the minute I saw it. This book is fairly good. If you are a new Shakira fan, I reacommend it. It tells the story of how this Latin Pop/Rock Icon became the huge star she's today. It tells the struggles and problems she had to overcome for reaching her goals and dreams. If you have known Shakira for a while you'll have already herad almost they say here..."
4,Beautiful and great quality!,"This digital piano is beautifully designed and has a good baby grand piano sounding and touching quality. Given the cheap price, you really get all your money back with its value and benefits delievered. The only con: Volume is not high enough.. even at max volume.. it is only good for in house performance."
