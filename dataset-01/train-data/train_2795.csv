4,Space Rangers rocked with a metal sound,"I give this CD a four based on what I can recall from the 2 Space Rangers LPs I once owned. At least I think I owned two. I know I owned Kryptonite.I must have owned 2, because I know one had a cover of SunShine Superman.Both had great artwork on the covers. Loved the music but I felt a bit too much background noise. Hopefully that has been cleaned up on the CD.It is interesting to compare Merryweather's ""Star Rider"" with Foreigner's""Starrider"". It is the same song told from two different points of view.One group sings it from the Star Rider's point of view, the other from thepoint of view of the earth-person who is picked up by the Starrider.One of the Space Ranger albums has a photo on the back of the band. One of the band members is dressed in drag. I guess Neil thought it would help sell records. I do not care much for men dressed in drag, but the music is worth the money. Like others, I also found ""Word of Mouth"" boring. Kryptonite is much better."
2,Group Theory and Chemistry review,"For this review keep in mind that I am using this book as a look up reference. It may be good if you read it front to back.As an experimental physics grad student, I found this book to be far too heavy on the math and short on the physical interpretation in the very technical sections. Specifically, chapters 2 to 7 could almost be considered a stand alone math intro textbook for applied group theory. There is very little reference to chemistry and to the utility of the techniques in those chapters.If I recall correctly, I have seen reviews that say that this book is to the point and succint, and this is the reason I bought it. Well those statements should be intrepretated as ``densely filled with math``. Of course, a perusal of the table of contents shows that the chapters are ended with proofs as appendices.This book is better than Flurry`s, but Cotton`s is better than this one(Bishop)."
4,Gary Cooper,"This film shows the classic Gary Cooper of that period. He handles the shy, quiet yet intelligence which won the hearts of moviegoers of the time. Teresa Wright and he have an unmistakable screen chemistry that adds to the overall plot of this movie."
5,"Spanish book - Naque;Ay, Carmela!",Thank you for the really fast shipping and the book condition is just as stated. It arrived well before the dates outlined. I will use you again.
3,Iceland Travel Guide,"I bought the guide thinking there would be many detailed maps of the regions. The country map is excellent and detailed, so I will keep it. It is small enough to pack so I can write notes in it as I travel."
4,Mixed in quality,"This book covers a wide range of possible instruments. At the low end are items that are unlikely to interest your child, such as a bleach bottle banjo and rubber band harp. At the high end are real instruments which require significant woodworking experience and time, such as tear-drop fiddle and celtic harp. In between, however, are a few projects, primarily woodwind and percussion, which would be manageable to do with and for your kids. I think that, given the price, there are enough different projects in the book that it is worth getting if you enjoy making things and have kids who are interested in experiencing different kinds of musical instruments."
4,Piano Red doesn't dissapoint,"This CD is a real treat for those who heard ""Red's Boogie"" in the early 50s, and wondered why there wasn't more. Well there has been much, much more, but it has not enjoyed a very wide audience. That probably won't change, but for those willing to look, the rewards are great, indeed. There is so much really good music available, now on CDs that choices must be made. No collection can be considered complete, however, without at least some of Piano Red's music."
3,Bain de Soleil Mega Tan Lotion with sunscreen,"It's not as good as the original,which was discontinued several years ago. The current product has sunscreen in it. Like many customers who LOVED the original, we don't want sun protection. We just want the mega tanning lotion or gel. This current product works, but customer needs many more applications to get the same effect. Will someone PLEASE tell me why such a successful, popular, profit-making product was d/c???"
4,Amazon purchase: Bain de Soleil Mega Tan Sunscreen w/self tanner,"Bain de Soleil Mega Tan Sunscreen w/self tanner is one of the least smelly self tanners I've used. Although, after a day or two, it's odor is also discernable. I apply it with a plastic baggie to ensure that it doesn't stain my hands."
2,Does not work,"This product does not Tan, It says a self-tanner and reviews I read I wanted to try it but, went back to what I was using because as I stated I applied for days and no WOW look at my TAN ! Would not recommend to anyone. This was the worst self-tanner I have ever tried and believe me I have about tried them all. I use to use Bain de Soleil no streak years ago and absolutely loved it why they stopped making that I really don't get it, that is why I gave this a try. No comparison whatsoever. I wasted my money !"
1,Doesn't work for me,This product proved worthless in a side by side test against Jergen's Natural Glow. Absolutely no color AT ALL!! Can not recommend.
5,Charming and adorable book,"Adorable book, filled with rhyme and wonderfull illustrations that my kids adore. My kids faces light up with the turn of each page looking at the pictures and listing to the text that goes with each page.Highly recomend to all parents with small children!"
2,"Cheap, but still not worth it","This is supposed to be a shooter/role-playing game, I guess. Whenever you save, you are transported to a special place. Then you have to make your way back to where you were and all the bad guys have respawned. Your character is underpowered at first and I was getting tired of covering the same ground over and over... This game won't run in Vista. I had to disable my firewall to install it on my XP machine. The game was way too buggy. Sometimes the video would just freak out and I would have to reload from the last save. When the game crashed completely, I decided this game was not worth it."
1,red sox t-shirt,Never received this t-shirt! Twice I recieved an ugly red sox hoodie with butterflies on it. I returned it the first time and said I didn't receive what i ordered and then the second time I got the same wrong item. I gave up and just got my money back.
3,It's ok but could be better,"The problem with 'small books' like this one is that they don't include all that you need to know. I also find that the organization of the book is poor, and it requires you to jump around a lot. I think that makes using the book difficult. It can be a good reference, but there are some better ones to use. Sometimes bigger is really better, and I think that it is the case with this book. There is a book written by an Italian author that is about the same size that is better organized.I also disagree with one review who said Prego was 'bloated' -- Prego is probably the best book to use as a beginner hands down. Grammar is explained concisely and in a way that is conducive to learning. It's expesnive, but I'd try to save up for it and buy it."
4,Well written,"If you are responsible for client/server systems, like it or not, you'll have to deal with Active Directory sooner or later. This is an excellent reference book. You'll be able to plan your implementation and avoid some common pitfalls. The material is concise and easy to read, the structure flows well and the overall format makes it valuable as both cover-to-cover reading and a reference. It's suicide to throw Win 2k and A.D. into a heterogeneous computing environment without proper planning. This book is a single source that will help insure a smooth transition.Great job!!!"
2,disappointing,"This book seems like it would be a great practical Active Directory design resource. While it does have some nuggets of useful information, they are obscured by the book's negative aspects.The illustrations are poorly designed and confusing. Many of them have mistakes. The author repeats himself and makes so many references to other sources of information (Microsoft white papers, the book's website, other books) that it distracts from the information presented. The chapters end with cheezy summaries that belong in a high school textbook. His writing style makes it difficult to understand the topics and the poorly presented ""real world"" examples don't add much to the explanation of the material.I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,Displeased,"I bought this product for child safety. My largest concern is the softness of the metal. It bends very easily. You can't just close the cabinet door, you have to keep your finger on the metal so it doesn't scratch the surfaces around it. I learned this the hard way. Funny, as I type my 11 month old daughter managed to open the tv cabinet with this product installed. Also, when the cabinet door is open, the long metal piece sticks out and creates a hazard for clumsy people like me. I don't think a plastic device would hurt as much."
4,looks good and works,"Amazing how everything is 3x the cost just because you want oil-rubbed bronze. Anyway this product works just fine, allowing you to change the hardware in your bathroom without having to change the water valve.***Before you buy***I learned the hard way, I re-tiled my shower walls thinking that all plumbing is universal. I was dead wrong. There are 2 major faucet makers in shower valves: Moen and Delta. If you have a Delta this product will not work. I highly recommend doing some research on various faucet systems before you start any project in your shower bath.Also, I had to purchase ""Moen 145058 Single Handle Tub and Shower Adapter"" because the screws holes on the water valve didn't line up exactly right with the trim kit. And then when I got my adapter and installed it, still only 1 screw hole lined up. It is secured to the wall just fine with one screw...but that was the only problem I had with this project."
4,Good allover stretch,"While I'm not sure that this workout really will help with weight loss since it's rather short and doesn't get your heart rate up very high, it's still a great yoga video. This is the only video I have with Sara (although I plan on purchasing more of her videos), and I love her pleasant demeanor, cheerful personality, and encouraging comments. As another reviewer noted, this is a good workout to do if you want to stretch out after doing harder cardio workouts. It moves at a nice pace, and isn't boring or tedious at all. I really like it for days when I need a good stretch, but don't have time to do a longer yoga video."
3,Just an ok workout,"I think this is a good place for new yoga lovers to start out. I have been doing yoga for only a few months but found this tape to be a little too easy. It claims to get your heart rate up but as soon as you start to really work out, it is over. Too bad it isn't broken down into two sections so that once you have the moves, you can watch it without the directions which makes it a slow moving tape. I found Denise Austin, the FIrm and other yoga tapes to be better as far as a work out goes."
1,Don't bother,"Worst yoga DVD I've ever tried. I'm going to stick with Rodney Yee, even his am yoga is better than this."
3,A nice introduction,"This book is a nice introduction to The Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander but not comprehensive. I would have liked to have seen many more illustrations--perhaps the entire text. This book does not have enough detail to satisfy, but again, admittedly is a very good introduction, at present apparently unique providing information and photos currently unavailable from any other easily accessible source."
3,Good reading,"This book talks about the author's experience traveling through many parts of Africa. The style of writing was simple and fun. However, the writer could have made more of an effort to learn about the people who live at the places he visited. At times, I felt he was traveling just for the sake of traveling."
2,"Interesting trek, poorly written account of travel","Reading ""Africa Solo"" creates a few feelings: 1)What a great trek though some very intersting parts of Africa, 2)Irritation by the author for his dumb innocence, but admiration for his frankness about it, and 3)Dread at the poor writing and observations. This is such a great opportunity to explore a great part of the world, but the author passes no useful information (environment, history, sociology) to the reader. Essentially, the book is a very simple account of the author's journey through parts of Africa. Shame that such an experience is recorded so poorly."
1,"Oh, how disappointing.","The author, to his credit, did not assume the arrogant posture of many expats/travelers abroad, and then didn't feel compelled to make up tales designed to make himself sound more interesting. That sole fact makes the book novel in itself.I still do not know why Mr. Kertscher made his trip. There is something to be said for ""making it up as you go along,"" but armed with sheer dumb luck and the kindness of strangers (who have no doubt seen this aimlessness before), Mr. Kertscer managed to come back and (unfortunately) write about it. He tells us virtually nothing about the political situations, history, etc. - things that would add color to his one-dimensional tale - and despite all the picturesque ground he covered, the only vaguely interesting photo is the one on the cover. Give it an A for marketing, D- for content. Next time, Mr. Kertscher, take a canned safari along with all the other tourists. Please."
5,Great account of an amazing journey.,"This is adventure/travel writing at its best. Kertscher takes us along as he hitchhikes his way across the Sahara, down the Congo River, and into the African rainforest. His smooth writing paints a vivid picture of the land and its people and his experiences along the way. Africa Solo is entertaining and enlightening, and, like any good book, left me wanting to read more."
2,Bottom of the barrel garage/punk compilation,"After some really top-notch installments of the PEBBLES series, Vol. 10 is a major let-down. None of the songs really register as good rock tunes; they all sound identical to each other. The two really awesome tracks are by Leather Boy, ""I'm a Leather Boy"" and ""On the Go"", which show that insanity really was alive and well in the New York City area in 1967. Other semi-interesting tracks include The Bold's ""Gotta Get Some"" and The Silver Fleet's ""Look Out World"" (an obvious re-working of ""Gloria"").It's unfortunate Vol. 10 is a big-time disappointment, and I would say it's worth it for the Leather Boy tracks, but I believe they can be found elsewhere on other compilations."
3,Great Prose; Unappealing Plot,"I was really impressed with the quality of writing in Domenic Stansberry's THE CONFESSION, which is far above the norm in the crime genre. Unfortunately, this novel features such an unappealing main character that I never really cared about the story.This, of course, was Stansberry's intention -- he's trying to write an ultra-dark, modernized version of a noir novel, with an unambigious anti-hero. But ultimately, the lead character is so amoral and unlikable that I was indifferent to THE CONFESSIONS's outcome, which made this book something of a chore to finish. I also found the book's final twist to be highly predictable, and therefore unsatisfying.THE CONFESSION won the Edgar award for best paperback original the year it was published. If you like your crime novels dark and and well written, it's probably worth your time."
5,Brilliant,This book is truly great. Not so common for the genre brilliant writing. I hope the Hard Case Crime will publish more books by this talented writer.
2,The Confession,Too much talk and a very poor plot. You can skip this book and look for a bunch of other books in the the very good and talanted HCC series.
3,pass the pillow,"In true Woody Allen fashion this movie was slow, the scenary beautiful the story ...little confusing, at times I wanted to punch the boyfriend of Vicky, but I guess he was just doing his job....the movie was slow and at times I thought the actors were going to sleep, but thats how Woody Allen directs his movie...slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww"
5,"Woody, woody","Awesome movie, scarlet is perfect like always, penelppppe is unbelievable, the only problem, the DVD version is censured and half of Penelope scenes were cut. The PG version is better."
4,Comic and Sombre Blend,"This is a very enjoyable movie. Woody Allen has a real ability to dream up crazy story lines and weave all their sub-plots into a stylish and entertaining whole. Vicky Christina Barcelona is no exception. While some reviewers found this movie `sombre' in fact I laughed a lot, much more than in `Match Point' for example, but there is no doubt that Woody Allen has a dark side. I get the feeling whenever I watch a film of his that underneath it all there is something unhealthy going on. This is well disguised by the humour but pessimism and sexual hang-ups as well as genius blend in with this very interesting, very flawed and very brilliant director."
1,The one star is for Cruz,"There must be different versions of this film because I certainly didn't see anywhere near a 5 star film.The acting, with the fabulous exception of Penelope Cruz, is bland and annoying. When Cruz enters the film, she shines. However, since the other actors have done brilliant performances in other films, I'd have to say it was the direction and script.The film I saw was inane, filled with self-absorbed characters and a less than witty dialogue."
2,Stars for Bardem and locations only,"Javier Bardem is always good and solid, and the Spanish locations are gorgeous. The music is nicely chosen too.However, there's a big problem with much of the dialogue, which does not seem authentic; there is no logic to Cristina wanting to stay with the nasty Maria Elena and her ex-husband Juan Antonio; there's no logic, either, in Vicky wanting to go off with J.A. after she's just gotten married; the narration is incredibly annoying and unnecessary.Woody Allen can do much better than this."
1,Over-hyped,"All I can say to those who haven't seen this movie is: Don't bother. I don't think I'd say its awful, it's just trivial and inconsequential. I am a fan of Bardem, Cruz and Johansen, but their performances didn't redeem this. The voiceover was annoying and the cinematography looked like a home movie, and totally failed to capture the beauty of Barcelona. Except for the occasional shot of Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia, it might have just as easily been Los Angeles. And if you think its gonna be erotic, think again."
1,Is this Woody's worst film?,"Possibly... It seems that there is no script (everyone could have improvised the dialogs as they are so predictable, naive and silly). There is no catch in the beginning of the film (yes, the film has a weak, weak start). The narrator'a voice is such a poor choice. The only thing that keeps you watching is the beauty of Barcelona.No one seems to be able to act in this film either. You want me to believe that Bardem is seducing all these women? Give me a break! He lacks any charisma in this film!Penelope is the only one who stands out. I'm not her fan, but in this film she is the only person who brings some life to the badly-performed story - from the first few minutes she appears on the screen.I would say: don't waste your time. This is one of the many films that can be easily skipped - missed - forgotten."
2,The Same Movie,Woody has been making the same movie for about ten years. If you've seen any of those you've basically seen this one.
3,WOODY ALLEN: ALWAYS REFRESHING!,"Vicky and Cristina, two American college students, decide to spend the summer in Barcelona, Spain. During their visit they meet a bohemian Spanish painter named Juan Antonio who's recently separated from his wife Maria Elena after a stormy relationship. The plot thickens in several directions when both women find themselves attracted to Juan Antonio! Once again Woody Allen proves his mastery at writing and directing original and refreshing stories. The three women: Rebeca Hall, Scarlet Johansen and Penélope Cruz look beautiful. Cruz won a well-deserved Academy Award for playing Maria Elena. Good show, don't miss it."
3,better than usual Woody Allen,"Maybe this is why they still let Woody Allen make films after all those really terrible movies?I hate the voice over narration in this film. A really good film maker lets theaction speak for itself?The acting was OK and the Spanish setting was very good,but the subject matter of American women tourists and a Spanish painterjust was kind of sexually trite as a subject?It seems every one wants a slightly crazy Latin artistas a lover: some sort of New York status symbol maybe?Real painters and artists are sometimes more practical than businessmenin their life choices ( mostly because they have to be).Still the result is better than the last two Woody Allen filmsI've seen, but still not up to his classic comedy style."
2,"a LOT, a lot of narration","Being a writer myself, I'm constantly told to ""show, don't tell"" when I write. And then I see a film like this, narrated head to toe, and I wonder if there are 2 sets of advice.It it like having a short story read to you."
4,Lives ambivalent passions,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a real pleasure to watch. Javier Bardem(Juan Antonio) portrays an artist with a passion for life and his charisma envelopes three very different women. Penelope Cruz is his volatile x-wife, while Rebecca Hall (Vicky) and Scarlett Johansson (Christina) portray two American friends visiting Barcelona who decide to accept Juan's invitation to spend the weekend in Oviedo.The movie's voice over comes across like a narrator telling us a fairy tale. This enhances the whimsical, and fantastic tone of the movie. In this fairy tale for, and about, adults, we learn about the passions, ambivalence, love interests, and illogical decisions that fly about creating ever more delirious scenes. Sit back and enjoy this film which is full of wit, warmth and life."
3,Mixed feelings,"First of all, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Bohemian life style has always fascinated me. It was beautifully filmed on fantastic location; acting was mostly good, at least Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem delivered; it was fast-paced and never boring.However it left me thinking: So what? It seems both Vicky and Christina (as well as everybody else in the story)after being through the events of the movie, came out completely untouched by them. Vicky remained pragmatic and unable to do anything drastic to change her life, Christina was still unsatisfied and unsure about what she wanted in hers.So what was the point of all this?"
5,What we learn from sexual liaisons,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Woody Allen's latest is, I think, one of his best. Two friends, Vicky and Cristina, decide to spend July and August in the Barcelona home of Vicky's relatives. They meet Juan Antonio (played by the amazing Javier Bardem), an abstract artist, and his former wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). A series of sexual liaisons occurs. The film is a reminder that most people have had impulsive sexual experiences. Sex tends to lead us into experiences we often do not intend. And those experiences change us, teach us things about ourselves and life that we likely are unable to articulate. Vicky and Cristina return to the U.S. mysteriously more mature."
4,"Good, but not great Allen","I'm an Allen fan. For me this was not a one of his great films, but was anentertaining, diverting one, with two terrific performances by JavierBardem and Penelope Cruz, a very good one by Rebecca Hall, and a decentone by Scarlett Johanssen.The key flaw -- Johanssen's character comes off as very shallow, so the complexityof her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more thanadolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film,but here it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film fromultimately feeling deeper and more complex. None-the-less, a romantic bittersweetfilm I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.Interestingly, even more than most of Allen's films this seems to ignite very different reactionsfrom viewer to viewer, so I'd encourage you to check it out for yourselfif you have any interest in the elements."
3,Woody's fantasy?,"The movie was done well, kept you interested, however, when is Woody going to get off his soap box about polygamy?"
3,Great actors Great cinematography script left me feeling very confused....,"This movie was like meeting a beautiful man who you think might like you but doesn't speak or understand any english. The scenery of Spain is so beautiful so perfect. It made me sadder I didn't get to Spain this summer. Maybe next year.Patricia Clarkson ,Scarlett Johannson,Javier Bardem and Chris Messina are beautiful and great actors, Most of the characters are unbelievably drawn.( Like Johannsen's character is ok with her lover having his ex- wife living in the house they share. Said character completely fine when Ex wife comes on to her and has sex with her and her boyfriend together. Come on ,now. I am no prude ,but I would be running for the door. Maybe its just that woody allen's view of the world is differant than mine."
3,But why an Oscar?,"The film was interesting, all the acting was good, the tiring Woody ""too much talking"" was typical, Penelope was cast well in this role - but nothing ""oscar worthy"" here . .??? Disappointed in that."
5,Unexpectedly Entertaining,"Like ""Matchpoint,"" ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" isn't a standard latter-day Woody Allen film. Instead, it's much, much better than his work from the last 25 years. Scarlett Johansson is as dry and lovely as ever, but Rebecca Hall is the standout here. As other reviewers have noted, it's hardly a comedy--but ""Vicky"" isn't exactly a droll drama either. The subtitle should probably be ""Getting Drunk and Sleeping Around in Spain."" Sounds like a good time!"
4,"great actors, great dialogue","Allen out of Manhattan, witty, human and over psicoanalised. Everyone acts at their best. A story about americans out of their place, experiencing ""contact"" with latin europeans. Great for people who understand Allen's criticism of white American (U S of A's)intelectualised primeval craves, structured social behaviour and obsesion with themselves."
4,"Deja vu, but perfect","Okay, I did have the feeling I'd seen it all before, and indeed loved it all before as well, but what made this rendition of Allen's much-loved bittersweet melody so perfect for me were the performances, rich with irony and playful contradiction. As for the plot, don't expect anything flashy or even particularly sidesplitting, but if you enjoy, say, the quiet films of Erich Rohmer, you will savor this little tale as you would a fireside cognac. Thank you, Woody."
2,Disappointment,I am a big fan of Woody Allen; I was looking forward to this movie and I must say it was a big disappointment. It was about nothing and even that was not done in an entertaining way.
3,Where's the Sound?,"The cinematography was beautiful, the stars were big-name, but why the budget sound? Most Blu-ray disks have at least 5.1, often uncompressed, and often 6.1 and 7.1 channels. Stereo two-channel sound just didn't meet my expectations.Many of us buy because of the rear cover blurb. This one described the movie as a ""sexy romantic comedy"". Well it was romantic, sexy - if you like three-ways and lesbian sex, but I guess it's funny only if you live in Manhattan."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"A totally plot-less and pointless movie with shallow characters and ridiculous dialogue. I rented this to watch with my wife because we love Woody Allen and she loves romantic comedies, but this film was a complete disappointment. This was nothing more than a tedious ""art film"" lacking the art. It was neither sexy or poignant or sensitive or even fun.When the movie ended we just looked at each other and said ""what the hell was that?"".One of the worst movies we've seen in many years."
1,"Good acting, stupid story","I am glad that I saw this movie on a plane and didn't spend good money to see this turkey. I think that what Woodie Allen had to say he said years ago and should be banned from ever making another film. I am a fan of all the actors and they did well with the stupid script the had to work with, but none of the roles were even worth a nomination."
1,Nowhere Man,"Why all this falling down and slobbering over Woody Allen? This movie was dull, unimaginative, and not connected to anything. ""Distant"" relatives invite the girls to Barcelona? No one seems to be at a loss for money (an unpublished poet who lives in a country villa)? It seems that Woody just wanted to get Scarlett Johannsen and Penelope Cruz in the same movie....Woody seems to be repeating himself in movies now with similar themes emerging. Larry David in ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" does in half an hour what Woody used to do in (roughly) two hours....Sorry, not worth buying or even renting."
4,Off the beaten path,"I thought this movie was refreshing in that it did notattempt to follow the standard romance story framework at all. There were many humorous moments but it was a drama w a clear message.And, anyone who is upset w Javier Bardem's character's womanizing and blatant use of his charms to get any and all women in the sack...is probably missing that message. Yes, it was an entertaining movie."
3,DVD won't play on a computer,"To start with, I happen to love this movie. I won't summarize the plot, as many reviews have already done so. It's visually appealing, witty, intelligent, and relatable. I've watched it many times.The film would get five stars, but I'm removing two for the product itself. It's copy protected, which I didn't see anywhere in the product description. I understand that they don't want the movie pirated, fair enough -- but as someone who does most of my TV and movie watching on a computer screen, now I'll have to pirate a copy just to watch this movie at any time when I don't happen to be near a DVD player. Most of the other young people I know also usually watch movies on their laptops and it's frustrating when the industry totally ignores their customers' lifestyles and needs like this. I wouldn't have paid for this movie if I had known I couldn't watch it on my computer."
1,"The Lives of vain, yet rather dull people","Two American girls go to Barcelona, both behave in different, but equally silly, ways while attempting to ""find themselves"". Neither do manage to learn very much at all, least of all the one supposedly doing post-graduate research on Catalan culture, - she seems to do no study either, which might help. They fall victim to a smouldering hulk, and his over the top ex-Wife. (This role well played by Ms Cruz).If this plot reminds you somewhat of Henry James, you might choose one of his novels rather than this very lame, unfunny and sad little film. Alternatively, go to the back catalogue of Mr Allen if you seek amusement."
3,Limit features well... make that none.,"I am not go to explain the details of this film but want to give you a head up. All you got on DVD is-""Play Movie""- ""Captions & Subtitles""- ""Scene Selection""That's it. No features, commentary, delete scenes, etc... Overall, I really do like the film."
3,This is a Blu Ray?,"While I think this movie is great and the video on the blu ray is also great, but the blu ray disk itself leaves a lot to be desired. First of all, there are absolutely no extras on the blu ray --- only the movie itself. And the audio is only available in 3.0 format, no 5.1 or 7.1. I have never seen either of these issues on a blu ray disc before. It is a disappointment in these two respects. Neither of these ""deficiencies"" are pointed out. The video and the movie itself are 5 stars."
1,"pointless, empty, boring movie","What a stupid movie! I didn't even watch the whole movie. No values, pointless, revolting- figures it's from Woody Allen!"
2,Good movie but...,"Of course this is a great movie, but there are absolutely no extras that you would expect on a nearly $30 blu-ray disc. All you get is the movie and Spanish and English subtitles. Seriously disappointing. Recommend saving ten bucks and just getting it on regular DVD."
3,"Typical Woody Allen vision, and I'm not referring to his glasses","This is an entertaining movie, but typical Woody Allen (a)morality.I'm far left of the far right, but what's missing in Juan and María Alena's relationship is a child, not a third bed partner.But what should we expect from that master of self-indulgence, who in life (and art) practices pedophilia and incest. You can see why he walked out on his family. Raising kids? I need to get back to my artistic vision!One weak spot in Allen's direction was his use of a narrator, which seemed a short cut around developing the plot and characters.Finally, I don't see why Scarlett Johansson made it so big. Part of a woman's sensuality and character come through in her voice, and hers sounds like a disaffected teenager, husky and unappealing (see Rachael Ray)."
1,Vicky Cristina Barselona,"I selected Penelope Cruz when I was completing a form in ""OscarMania"" because ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" was nominated in her native land, because she's one of the my movie favourite artistes, because she's loved with our advertisers, because she likes... to look in telescope.It's false when I'll say I like to watch ""tv soap opera"". To seat and look into the box day after day isn't my nature. Concerning movie. The one turned out like a part of some ""tv soap opera"". But I am not falling into a faint because, at the same time, this movie showed how it isn't advisable to travel for the sake of it.General impression of movie must hasn't been main thing for each single artist. Main thing for artist is whether a role is performed, whether a role is subperformed or a role is overdone. Using correctly this approach a role itself will search such artist. There is nothing for it but to select."

1,"In your dreams, Woody...","What a terrible film! The only thing interesting about it is Mr. Allen's delusion that people would ever want to see it. Empty-headed, narcissistic, idle robot-actors mimicing what Allen takes to be universal angst. Suggest you get back on the couch for a mental health tune-up, Woody! NO redeeming features...not even Barcelona itself.Run, do not walk, away, and don't look back at this boring mess."
1,DON'T BOTHER WATCHING!,"First of all let me state that I'm a hardcore Woody fan.Secondly,I totally agree with reviewer Ken Douglas.What was the little fellow thinking?Is this the same guy who gave us ANNIE HALL,MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY,MANHATTAN,LOVE AND DEATH and even his ANYTHING ELSE (A GREAT FILM COMPARED TO THIS ONE)???I can't believe I wasted my time and my eyes watching this piece of junk.SIMPLY PUT (PARDON MY STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS):PURE GARBAGE!Don't even bother renting this flop.One star goes to the two female actresses since it wasn't their fault to work around ahorrible script.Furthermore,Javier Bardem has to be one of the ugliest and worst fiascos that spanishcinema has ever produced.If he can speak english I'm Richard Gere."
1,VCB sucked Matchpoint was better by far,I hated this movie and don't get what all the hype was about. The main character vicki was annoying and I didn't care if she found love or not. Scarlett johannsen was the only saving grace. There is also a narrator over the whole movie which makes it almost unbearable. I do not recommend this and it did not deserve ANY awards or accolades. Watch Matchpoint -- much better film.
1,A truly awful movie,"The number of positive reviews of this film is astonishing, but if possible I'm even more amazed at how mild the negative reviews generally are. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a truly awful movie. There was not a single believable moment in the whole thing, not the plot, not the acting, not the dialogue, not even the costumes and the props. (Those giant balloon Pottery Barn wine glasses in constant use--really? They expected us to believe that's everyday glassware for Europeans?) And the narration! Criticism of the quality of the narrator's voice is quite beside the point, people. Why was it there at all? It was like having someone read at you a bad first draft of the short story on which the movie was based while it played in the background. The characters were meant to be passionate, but they really seemed to be acting passionate and inventing drama to relieve their excruciating boredom. Unfortunately, none of it relieved ours."
3,Lukewarm summer romance,"The Bottom Line:Vicky Cristina Barcelona is enjoyable enough but it's a completely lightweight film which undercuts itself at every turn with the most redundant, bland-sounding, and ridiculously unnecessary narration that I can remember (""Vicky and Cristina then went to dinner with Juan Antonio...Vicky and Cristina then returned to their hotel room""); it's quick-moving and well-acted but by no means an accomplished film.2.5/4"
2,"A fairly well-told, but kind of sick, story","Under the veneer of a tale of interwoven relationships, this is an attempt to glorify dysfunctional and self-destructive behavior at the expense of what one of the actors calls ""puritanical values"". Characters that live a traditional lifestyle are portrayed as empty and vapid, while those engaging in spurious casual relationships are presented as exciting and self-fulfilled. Despite this, things do not go well for the 'wild ones'. My suspicion is that in real life, things would have gone even more badly.Penelope Cruz does a wonderful acting job as the psychotic ex-wife; Javier Bardem does nearly as well as the contemporary Casanova. I don't get the point of Scarlet Johansson, but maybe that's just me. Bottom line - it kept my attention for the duration, despite 'chick-flicks' not being my usual genre. But the movie itself, like several of its key characters, seemed kind of dysfunctional."
2,"Different Locale, Same Woody","Woody Allen's best movie in years? Hardly. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a familiar comedy-drama that coasts on the good will of its actors (notably Oscar winner Penélope Cruz) while offering picture-postcard views of Spain. Despite the change in locale, there's really nothing new under the sun. The pretentious narration might have worked better if spoken by Woody himself. A definite improvement over ""Scoop"" but certainly no ""Match Point."""
2,Vicki Cristina Barcelona,Good character study but not nearly as funny as I expected; especially with Cruz winning the Oscar for best supporting actress in a comedy.
2,Not for me,"Gal pals Vicky and Cristina go to Barcelona for the summer where they are immediately propositioned by an artist. They both become enamored of him and then his ex-wife comes back into his life.I really hated this movie. I couldn't relate to or understand any of the characters and found their lack of morals sad and off-putting. Rebecca Hall was good as Vicky, but Scarlett Johansson wasn't believable at all as Cristina. She looked like she was just sleepwalking through the movie, adlibbing her lines without emotion. As the artist, Javier Bardem was supposed to be completely irresistible, but he didn't appeal to me at all. Penelope Cruz had a small part as the artist's ex-wife; she was exciting and passionate and I wish her part had been bigger.Though the movie is all about sex, it was tedious and distasteful. It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy and it lacked any truly touching moments. The DVD has no extras. All in all, a disappointment."
2,Penelope steals the show,"Thank goodness this movie was set in gorgeous Barcelona and gave us something interesting to look at while suffering through this lame story (it has been too, too long since Allen has told a compelling one). Penelope Cruz out-acted everyone else, stealing every scene she was in and dwarfing the usually wonderful Scarlett Johansson. The best moment in the film was the expressions on Vicky and Cristina's faces as they left Spain."
3,Complexity of human relationships,"Woody Allen makes another film set in Europe that explores the complex nature of human relationships. Compared to ""Match Point"" and ""Cassandra's Dream"", ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is the weakest one of all.For one, the background narrator of the movie is boring and uninspiring, in spite of being necessary. Without him, movie would make no sense since there is no other way to learn about emotional and psychological fragility of its main characters.However, the premise of perpetual (love) triangles as a means on maintaining balance in unstable relationships of intellectual (un)equals is just as futile. We cannot but think by the end of the movie that single people are meant to perpetually search for true love, couples are doomed in their boring, predictable bahaviors and love triangles simply cannot last. Not even a cast of Hollywood acting favorites can save this film."
5,just the crickets,"this recording introduced the world to the Crickets. I remember vividly the first time I heard ""Thatl'e Be The Day"" when I was 18 years old. Too bad Buddy Holly decided to break up the group."
2,"Gentle stretching, NO sweating","The tropical setting is beautiful and Sara Ivanhoe does a nice job leading you through the series of poses, but the title of this workout is not accurate. This is not a ""power yoga"" workout and there is absolutely no sweating. It's more of a series of gentle stretches that feel good, but never work up a sweat and are not very challenging. I was pretty disappointed in this one."
4,Good text book,"This was a good purchase. It was the correct text book (edition) thatcI needed for my class, and I was able to get it much cheaper. The book itself was in great condition, especially for a used text book. The seller shipped it promptly, and it arrived undamaged. I highly recommend this seller, and would likely do business with them again."
3,T-Rex Tortoise Dust,It works great. I feel like my tortoise gets enough of the nutrients he needs with it. Thank you.
2,Good but the circuit goes out every 1-2 years,I've had two of these and the circuit seems to go out every 1-2 years. I called customer service and they sent me a new circuit board the first time. But when that board went out they told me to by a new lock. I think I'll buy a Schlage as I have had better luck with them overall.
3,Where's the meat?,"The book is a nice collection of short, easy to read, presentations on memesis and intertextuality. The focus here is ""that"" mimesis was used by early Christian authors; some works even address the ""how"" and the ""why"" behind the practice.But, alas, these works offer nothing as to what effect (if any) these findings may have or should have on today's theology. If that is your interest, you'll need to look elsewhere."
2,Really hard to connect if you have small hands,"I can't say the other type of connections are better having never tried them. But I was surprised how difficult it was to slide these into the notches for a locked fit. If you don't have strong, big hands you're going to need some wide pliers. The connection also leaks a little. Ew. But they are inexpensive and the metal collar connection is probably one of the most secure tube-to-end connector out there."
4,Doesn't weigh small amounts,"The scale arrived in excellent condition, looked as represented, but I am disappointed to find that amounts less than eight ounces don't even register. This means I'm going to have to purchase an additional scale for those small amounts. If I'd had time, I probably would have returned this scale and searched for a different one that would solve that problem."
3,So far works pretty well.,"The scale does work, however, you must be very careful it changes from pounds to ounces randomly and if you are thinking you are weighing in pounds and you are actually in ounces, may not be a good thing."
5,Great video for the collector,"This video compilation is a great review for the collector or history buff. With segments by Ronald Reagan and a great overview of the New York City (historical) water system, this provides hours of fun for someone of the nature to watch historical films. I purchased this as a gift and the person really enjoyed it."
5,"""Making Quilts ~ Creating Art""","Charlotte Grossman has created a very personal look at the art of quilting as an independent art form. She makes the distinction between art and craft seem irrelevant. This glimpse into the lives, works, and creative process of the ten women quilt artists exhibits a seriousness and genuineness that is consistently fascinating. In this documentary the artists are captured through interviews and direct observation. The process and excitement of making art is compellingly revealed. ""Woman's Work: Making Quilts ~ Creating Art"" should not to be missed."
5,5 stars.,"Go ahead and make your art. This DVD offers insight and inspiration if that's what you need. It offers interesting art to look at if that's what you want. It's well produced, cohesive and interesting. There isn't a lot of variety out there for this type of DVD, so get it."
5,Great Book,"I loved this book - it was well written and I enjoyed both Linda and Sonny's perspective. This is an excellent depiction of the course of the illness and how it affects the lives of those around them.I highly recommend this book, not only for those with Bipolar Disorder, but also as an educational tool to help families recognize the disorder early so more people will seek treatment."
1,Am I the Only One?,"Am I the only one who thinks there's something wrong with Sonny Kramer? I did not like either one of these people in this book. I kept reading this book, even though I hated it from the beginning, because I kept thinking there would be more to it than an egotistical man justifying his stalker-type behavior.I heard a lot about her physical beauty over and over, but I did not see that beautiful person he kept saying she was. I'm sure she probably is a wonderful person when she's healthy, but he spent more time describing her physical attributes than the beauty inside.He tells a mentally ill person that he's dating someone she's jealous of in order to hurt her and make her come back to him? Then he kicks out his boarder the night she randomly calls and says she's coming back? And we're supposed to feel like he's a hero for his obsession with this woman?Please tell me I'm not the only one that feels something is terribly wrong here."
4,concomitance is key,"The video wasnt put together with a huge production crew, but the pictures, motions, and ideas are clearly presented. I have been useing the system for 6 weeks now and my acne has cleared up and i am finally gaining weight that i have been trying ot do for the past 9 years. And my Ligaments and tendons in my shoulders have been tightening them selves up and no longer dislocate thanks to this brilliant system."
1,Shockingly bad production,"Appallingly bad presentation, awful delivery, terrible audio. Cooley jumps back andforth from the frame looking disheveled and confused and lets his students give the same set ofinstructions Muscles are not referred to by names. I would laugh instead except I wastedmy money. Maybe his system has merit but I wouldn't know it from watching this mess."
5,"As essential as ""Midwestern Songs...""","If you only buy one Dillinger Four album, buy ""Midwestern Songs..."" Of course, then you'll be upset that you can only buy one D4 album and you'll kill, cheat, and steal to get your hands on ""Situationist Comedy."" Again, Dillinger Four manages to take the best in insightful political lyrics and catchy, hook-filled pop punk, throw in a great blend of their two lead vocalists (Erik and St. Paddy), and come up with a timeless record. I couldn't even think of a dud on this disc, though I think my favorite (and this was a tight race, folks) is ""New Punk Fashions for the Spring Formal.""If you like music, you'll like Dillinger Four."
5,"take a wild guess, it's frickin' dillinger four!","I'm just going around and reviewing dillinger four albums cause they're my favorite band. This album is beautiful, so buy it or buy another one of their albums, but for christ's sake, don't let another minute pass without hearing these guys if you never have before!"
3,Fat Wreck & Ship Wrecked,"After the past,inspiring release of ""Versus God"",I was awaiting this release with many expectations. Situationist Comedy is a let down,no doubt about it. This doesn't even sound like the original Dillinger Four. The pace is fast I will say that,but I have heard much,much better from this band than this."
4,How right the first reviewer is.,This is a pretty good movie but suffers from a cheesy ending. Lamarr is great looking and acts well in this one and Spencer Tracy is always good. Veree Teasdale is also really good as Lamarr's society friend.
3,wrong cover,"this book i just got it, but the cover is totally different with what i saw on the website,page is only 273 in total, not 288, same ISBN number though. i have no idea why that could be happened.but inside the detail, i would say i'm kinda like it.very simple but understandable.so, beside the cover and pages, it's a good book for helping learn japanese."
2,Seemingly comprehensive not at all,"To a person uneducated about Pomeranians, you could think that this covered it all. But I bought this book in concurrence with my first Pomeranian and discovered it really wasn't all it says it is.If you want to know about dog origins, temperment, AKC standards and cute doggy pictures it's okay, but as far as puppy care it is as basic as it gets. Stuff ANY puppy book would tell you.Because I have looked at a lot of sources, but am a first time Pom owner, the main thing that tipped me off about this lack, is the medical chapter-which briefly describes what all puppies are vaccinated for and common puppy problems, completely failing to note hypoglycemia! Which is a SERIOUS COMMON health problem for anyone owning a toy dog.Don't buy it"
2,She wasn't his first choice...,"If these two were meant to be together, how could Tomasso fall in love and marry someone else after knowing Maggie for two years? I just couldn't buy his attraction to Maggie after his very real rejection of her six years before. I understood that he wanted his best friend back and thought she would be good for his children, but the love and passion of his life? When he preferred his first wife over Maggie six years ago? Not likely."
2,Not that great,I bought this because it was by Lucy Monroe and now I'm wondering if it's a completely different author because it wasn't anything like her other books. Just so so.
2,Hump Floor Mat,"I was disappointed with the mat, i thought it would be longer. The piece only covers the hump in your truck and you need to buy the sides from Husky Liner for it to cover the whole carpet area. I think the mats are way overpriced. I kept the same mats that came with my truck and the hump mat does have gaps on both sides but at least it does cover more of the carpet area than if i had purchased a cheaper hump mat."
5,heavy duty flexible rubber deep grooves made in USA,"PROS:made in USAheavy dutyflexible rubberdeep groovesplenty of length to go over hump and under both matsCONS:Amazon never seems to have the correct item number, never use ""find parts that fit your vehicle"" always go to company website, I used Huskeyliner.com to get my item number.installed in a 2010 Ford F150 regular cab. at first it seemed to wide but the grooves allow the rubber to relax and lay flat."
1,"picture shows it for the front seat , but it is for the back seat and I can't use it.",I did not realize that the floor mat is not for the front floor mats but rather for the back seat. I did not understand that when I ordered the mats and therefore I cannot use it.
1,Misleading - only Hump mat - not floor mat and over the hump,"I do fault myself some as well for not diligently reading , but this ad is somewhat misleading and this mat is WAYYYY!!!!!!! over priced $35 for just the hump mat --- I should have just bit the bullet and bought the weatherteck custome fit... additionally there is nothing ""custom"" about this generic straight peice of rubber.... avoid making my mistake --avoid this product.instead do your self a favor and check out this better alternativeWeatherTech 443241 FloorLiner"
3,"The title should be ""An Introduction to Annuities""","The book is great for an intorduction...period. Nothing technical, no details and no insight. That is why I would have a different title than plain ""annuities"". I was a little mislead."
3,Good for a start!,I had no idea of Access or data bases. After reading it I was able to quickly step into action.. It's good for a total beginner but not for more experienced users..
2,Someday You'll Cry,"Someday You'll Cry is the name of tract four sung by the Standells and the reason I bought this CD. It is a good thing I liked at least this one sung prior to buying it because after listening to the rest of the CD, today was the day I cried. This is a collection of amateurish attempts at equaling the established stars of the day. If anything, it taxed my patience to listen to it. If you're a fan of (really) raw garage punk, perhaps you might find more here then I did; but if your looking for some hidden nugget of musical gold, I don't believe you will find it here. Try Texas Battle of the Bands featuring the Bad Seeds."
4,Searing passion bound them--jealous fate tore them apart,"For four years, green-eyed Alisha Williams had been Princess Shalee, the cherished wife of the Oglala chief Gray Eagle. Still their love was stronger than the surging white water of a snow swollen stream and more powerful than the fiery crimson sun that commanded the earth. But fate envied their perfect love and swept the stunning Alisha down a raging river and out of Gray Eagle's life.There was no way Gray Eagle could known that his love was alive when his empty teepee proved she was gone. But the daily torment of his lonely heart and the nightly agony of unfulfilled passion insisted that somehow she had survived destiny's decree. He had rescued Alisha many times before -- somehow he would find her once more. No river was too wide and no journey was too long to find his beloved, to share again their BRAZEN ECSTASY."
1,What a disappointment!,"I started out with the first book, ""Savage Estasy"", which I thought was well written, very entertaining and almost believable (which is of course a stretch for any romance novel!). The second book was OK, the third was getting a little bit stupid and the fourth - ""Brazen Estasy"" just made me want to throw up! What in God's name was Ms Taylor thinking? Nothing about this book was consistant with the other stories. Grey Eagle suddenly had morals, Alisha had the maturity of a 12 year old and their constant repetative whining was boring. The villianess (Leah) would have been killed in her opening scene if the author was in the same mind-set as she was in the earlier books. At no time did this book touch reality. And, worse yet - even the sex scenes anoyed me. I guess the only reason I continued to read it was because I kept waiting for something to happen that would somehow pull the whole thing together! It never happened. Ugh! I'm done with this series."
3,Halfway Decent,"I still have not finished reading it yet - I only just started it 2 days ago.My main problem with it is the ""Historian's Note"".They say that it takes place between December 27th, 2254 and January 19th, 2255.That is highly unlikely since this series takes place in the 22nd Century and not the 23rd.If this really takes place during the dates indicated, then they should meet up with Kirk and crew.Where are they?!!!"
2,Interesting premise - poor final execution,"Like most of the other negative reviewers, I found this lacking. It started going down hill with the scene with the Admiral ordering Trip's arrest and never regained any traction in my opinion."
3,Meh...,"This was nothing special. I suppose it is fine if you want a net that is ""okay"" and you don't mind doing a little rigging. This was average at best."
5,Quality,This is a big net. It was actually wider then our volleyball court. I'm sure it is official size but it was much wider than the last one we had. Very quality.
2,It would have been nice to know this ahead of time...,I rated this two stars because it didnt come with any rods to hold the net. Nor did the description indicate that I needed to purchase them separately.
4,Important Book; Flawed Version,"I want to make very clear that this is a review of the Kindle version of this book and not the book and its contents. I am being intellectually challenged by this book and think it a very important work. However, the Kindle version is marred by numerous misspellings, typos, and other artifacts which seem to demonstrate a lack of even cursory spell checking. This does a great disservice to the author and the reader. While I have seen similar errors in other Kindle books, the sheer quantity I have observed so far (I have read approximately 42% of the book according to my Kindle app), make it an egregious example of inadequate or even non-existent proofing. I have no desire to apportion blame, but merely to point out that this is a problem with digitized books that truly needs to be addressed and ameliorated if digital books are to prosper. Surely, at some point in the process, some agency is, or certainly should be, responsible for textual accuracy."
5,Fascinating Book,Peter Enns does a great job of introducing evangelicals to the complexities of Biblical scholarship. It's too bad that many are punished for honesty.
5,EXCELLENCE AT ITS BEST !,I would highly recommend this book to seminarians and Priests.It is very deep and will show you many roads and signs for the times to come and to expect while you tend to God's call and tend to His sheep. I couldn't put the book down. The book was very good and to the point at the same time....deep.I highly recommend this book to seminarians and Priests !!!
5,All you need to learn to play!,"Not much else to say but YEAH!Good instruction, easy to follow,and some extra fun techniques.I also liked the included booklet with the music notation for some fun songs."
2,Just average,The Men's perfume - Casual was just average.It was disappointing because I have been using the Casual for women over a long time now. And that is a lovely perfume. Sweet smell and it stays. I really like it.I was very happy to find the Casual- for Men and ordered 2 for my family. And the feedback I got is that the smell is okay but it does not stay.This makes it an average perfume.
1,Absolutely annoying and stupid,The book drags on and on about the heroine's silent suffering of having had a tooth pulled. As the reader I just didn't care and frankly became bored of reading about it. The reader is constantly reminded of the hero's similar appearance to Mel Gibson. Which is not my cup of tea in the looks department (and esp. the personality dept.). So everytime I wanted to imaging Harrison Ford I was jolted into imaging Mel Gibson. Blah. Also the hero is an ex confederate soldier. Yuck. So now I have to stomach Mel Gibson's looks on a bigot. Now that's just redundant. I just did not have the patience to finish this book. Into the denotion pile it west went. P.S. the story takes place in the late 1800s in the wild west of the U.S.
2,Not a fan,It was received in a timely manner. I used to wear Civet Musk in the 70s and this does not come close to the scent. Don't like it at all!
1,a horrible book,"this book starts on a down note and just goes downhill from there. a must miss. no useful information at all. anythinking about reading this book, stop now or you'll regret it."
5,very good study quide,i was very happy with the macarthur topical bible. i now can find things when i have no idea what they mean.
2,Not so hot,"It is not very useful for me because it is not comprehesive enough. It seems most thing I look up are not even in it. Sorry to say, because he is a good theologian, teacher, and writer. Maybe I misunderstood what it was."
5,Goes beyond the usual focus on common developmental stages,"There are plenty of child-rearing advice books on the market: what sets Liberation's Children apart is its incorporation of cultural values, symbols and ideas into its consideration of the forces and influences which shape future generations. Reports go beyond the usual focus on common developmental stages to describe how adults teach the basics of modern American culture, and how it changes the nature of modern American children. A very different set of insights which parents will appreciate."
5,Great book for beginners and experienced cooks alike!,"I loved this book. I had been cooking for years, but this book offered a lot of practical advice and great recipes. For beginners, you delve right into preparing delicious meals right from the start. I intend to buy this book for my daughter."
4,A Must Read if You Loved the Movie!,"Written by the screenwriter and director of ""A Knight's Tale"" this book provides a fascinating insider's look at the film's creation. The 24 page photo album includes rare candid shots of the film's cast and crew.The story is a classic underdog tale with likeable characters. I particularly enjoyed reading the scenes that were ultimately not included in the film. Although I have watched the movie several times... these passages added a depth to the characters that made kept the storyline fresh for me."
2,"Not A Classic, But...","This cd is not a classic, but it is definitely a good representation of acoustic blues. There are three or four pretty good songs on the cd."
3,"Good ideas, too many words.","Not enough practical information can be found in. There is too much triviality.If the author could omit the needless words, the book would be the quarter of the whole.It can be good for a very beginner flea. In other case keep looking for other books in the theme or from this author."
4,nice glasses,These glasses are very clear and block the glare of the sun. I love them! I've had Nike sunglasses before and am a big fan. Highly recommended.
2,vampire movie,Mediocre vampire movie. Actors were good; music was good; storyline was mediocre. The main reason I bought it was that I was raised in the house in which it was filmed.
3,What's it about?,"Armand Assante is a vampire. His lover is. His father is a long-dead demon (or 'dragon'). He wants to resurect his dead dad. In walks a descendant of St. George with his pregnant wife.The vampires want to use the baby as a sacrifice in order that Armand and his demon dad can be reunited.So it's about demons, vampires, blood sacrifice, possession, etc. All rolled into one very low budget and (almost) sexy film."
1,Ugh! Waste of 3 bucks!,Armand Assante must have been DESPERATE for money or something when he agreed to star in this film. He's the only actor who can actually act. Everyone else in the film just kind of stands there and reads lines. It is soooo bad. Don't wase your money! I can't believe some people actually LIKE this movie! Terrible peice of you-know-what!
1,Dreadful,Huge waste of Armand Assante. He's one of America's best actors but this film was well below his talents. One absolutely brilliant moment late in the film but this is one truly terrible movie.
4,a wonderful historical reference,"wanting to know more about the royal jewel collection, i purchased this dvd. what a wonderful (albeit short at 50 minutes) piece!historically informative, visually stunning, and well presented, i am entirely pleased with this purchase.not only can these beautiful pieces be seen up close, but the accompanying historical footage of various members of the royal family is tip top. it was also interesting to see how the jewels changed settings and hands over the years.for anyone interested in the royal family and/or jewelery in general, this dvd is well worth the price."
3,Disappointed,I gave the video 3 stars only because of the photos and clips. I was very disappointed to find mistakes. A glaring one being the misidentification of the Duchess of Teck. It is a shame that careful research was not done. I was also put off by the lack of objectivity concerning Queen Mary.
5,nice stuff!,"the two previous reviews do a great job on history of the cd so i'm not going to be redundant. the music is very spacey instrumentals. i just love how this band stretches out the sounds and chords. main title, Orion Awakes would fit very comfortably on Pink Floyd's ""Saucerful of Secrets"" release. both guitar and keyboard fans will find plenty of music to love on this cd. even though released in the 70s, i don't believe it sounds dated at all. especially with the interest in krautrock and progressive music these days. great packaging and liner notes too. i highly recommend this release and enjoy your journey!"
5,Creative and Innovative,I love this book. I love the designer. It got my creative juices flowing. I've already bought another book in the series.
4,Get ready to create!,"I refer to this book often. It has sparked my creativity and also helped me with more technical details thanks to the step by step guide to each project. On some projects, I would have liked even more details but anybody who's been scrapbooking for a while will have fun with this book.I also have the second one in the series: Photo Art. Another good book but I still find Creative albums the most useful to me.Definitely would recommend it to anyone even beginners!"
3,"Good, but not a homerun","First, this is a very valuable book for the MR2 enthusiast and/or proud owner. It compiles many of the magazine articles, reviews, and comparisons that were published as the cars were released. It serves as a wonderful reference as to what the automotive press believed to be important, desireable, and ""cool"" at a specific point in time. Perspectives do change over time, and this is an excellent respository of thoughts that will serve as a baseline.However, I have been searching for a tome of information on the MR2 that rivals what is available for the Mazda MX-5 Miata, similar to Garret's ""Miata Handbook"", or any of Tanner's ""Fix it. Trick it."" series of publications. Specifically, I am interested in the engineering of the MR2, Do-It-Yourself guidelines, Do's and Dont's, Living with your MR2 type of stories. While the ""MR2 Gold Portfolio"" has SOME of these elements tucked inside it, it is not the comprehensive information source that I hoped it would be."
5,5 cookies for this one!,"I am a preschool teacher and a grandma. This is a great book. It doesn't hurt that the little girl on the cover looks just like my granddaughter, but the words and the charming animal friends are just as delightful! Lots of good ideas without feeling preachy. Highly recommended."
5,What is better than COOKIES?,"My kids get this! Cookies is quickly becoming a favorite book at our house. Some of the words and concepts are difficult for kids to grasp, and admittedly not words that I work into daily conversation with my little ones. But having a book that so beautifully compares words like ""modest"", ""fair"", and ""generous"", with cookies makes sense to little minds. One of my favorite words is ""open-minded"". A bunny offers green cookies to a little girl and the captions reads, ""I've never seen cookies like that before, but, uh, sure, I'll try one."" A great lesson for adults too. This book has been a wonderful conversation starter with my children. But they always want to have a cookie after we read it!"
5,My class loves this,"We read this everyday at lunch in preschool. The children are fascinated with the illustrations and even though the concepts may be big, relating the situations of life to cookies and friends, they get it! I hear references through the day to the book...When children in class are sharing I overhear them say ""You get a bite, and I get a bite"". Proud teacher here. This us the best one of the series"
1,Damaged,The book said used. But it came water damaged. I never expected that since I buy used books all the time. I was not happy......
4,A very enjoyable tale...,"This is a fun read reminiscent of the Chronicles of Narnia, though not as richly developed. Still, the story is appealing for its straitforward message and enjoyable setting.I respectfully disagree with the librarian who compares this book the the Harry Potter series. While the Potter books are excellent, not every fantasy written since is an attempt to ""jump on the fantasy bandwagon"". I would hate to see all new young adult fantasy labeled as copy cats, which is what happened to adult fantasy for years after Tolkein.This is a fun series, and worth checking out."
2,Mediocre at best,"Lots on XML, little on the Semantic Web. Not clear what audience the book is geared towards.For managers the book is too heavy on the technical details of XML and XML Schema. For developers and architects who would actually want to implement a semantic application there is too little substance on ontologies, semantic web, semantic web services or OWL to be of any use.Many chapters (and the book in general) are poorly organized. For a much better (and more practical) explanation of the key concepts check out the recently released ""Explorer's Guide to the Semantic Web""."
3,not actually much about the Semantic Web,"Of the topics the subtitle says it covers (XML, Web Services, and Knowledge Management), it's stronger on the Knowledge Management bit than on XML and Web Services. IMO it is a bit light on specific technologies and concepts used in the Semantic Web. This is especially true of Chapter 8, ""Understanding Onotologies"", which gives you a high-level definition of ontology (with detours like an introduction to logic systems and a discussion of directed graphs), but has only a very sketchy discussion of OWL, one of the important pieces of the Semantic Web. (The book does do a reasonable job explaining RDF, though)."
5,Excellent,"This book is an excellent read : strong on substance without getting too complicated. The book does a good job of balancing the vision with the technology that is going on now. While this book does go into details (ontologies, taxonomies, XML technologies, RDF, web services, etc.), it does it in such a way that it is easy to understand. It is good in that there are some chapters that are geared towards businessmen (CTOs), and others geared for the more technical.Don't think that you can read it all in one sitting, though. I just finished it, but I will probably need to re-read some of the chapters (the chapter on ontologies is very good, but is a lot to digest). I enjoyed this book immensely. Other books I have seen on this subject are way too difficult to understand."
4,Texas history - Little known Cottonclads,Well written and interesting for Texans who may not be aware of the cottonclads participation in Civil War coastal protection.
2,Wasted visuals.,"Beautiful to watch. I agree that it's similar the movies ""the Crow"" and ""Prophecy"" and very dark and moody, but it suffers from a horrible story line, bad editing and directing. Shame, it could have been good in the right hands."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered this movie. Low budget flicks usually aren't very good but since this is a religious based film and since I'm a Christian who loves these types of movies, I thought, ""Why not?""I was not expecting such an awesome plot and even better sub-plot. I wasn't expecting such great special effects, or such great performances by actors I really hadn't heard of before. This film had me from the beginning all the way to the very unpredictable climactic ending. A great film that went under the radar. Buy this movie!!! I did and it's one of the best movies I have ever purchased. It's the Christian ""Matrix""."
1,This movie is just another low brow turf war flick,"Like Skin Walkers, this movie is just another low brow turf war flick with a super natural element added in so it'll sell. The big angel demon special effect is.... (wait dramatically)... contact lenses. No wings etc. Everywhere you see angel or demon, insert biker, drug dealer, mafia dude, tough guy, looser...I probably paid more to buy it, then they did to make it."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this movie thinking it was going to be like ""The prophecy"" but it turned out to be more like ""A clockwork orange"" It was very hard to follow. I also found that the characters lacked motivation in the storyline to justify their actions. I couldn't identify with or sympathize with any of the characters. The ending was the worst I've seen in a long time. I just sat on my couch and said ""what?"" in disbelief and confusion."
1,terrible,I bought this movie after reading all the rave reviews posted here. I thought It was AWFUL! The acting was so bad that I was embarrassed for the actors and wondered how they didnt break out in laughter at each other. I wish I could have seen in this movie what everyone else saw. I was so disapointed! The only actors that werent a laughing stock were andy whitfield and the actress who played Jade-everyone else was pitiful.
1,Terrible Movie,"Terrible movie do not waste your money. Not worth owning, go to the library and take it out. I donated the one I bought to our local library."
3,its an alright b movie,"The premise behind the story isn't bad. Actors aren't too bad either. The setting is nice and dark and gritty, but the demons are a little comical. Over all I wasn't expecting something grand and amazing so it was an ok movie."
2,Good Solid 2 Stars,I didn't expect much from this movie. It was weird and it was shot in a really weird way. It was straight to DVD but I thought I would give it a shot and bought it. I must say it was entertaining but I don't think that it is for everybody and I am not sure that everybody would like it as much as I did. If the story hadn't had some of the suprises it did I probably would have rated it a 1 but it was interesting enough and unpredictable enough for me to actually recommend it to some sci-fi fans and fans of other movies about archangels and that type of genre.
3,"Watchable, but has unfulfilled potential.","This movie was good, but it could have used a lot of improvement. It was constantly dark and dreary, and quite monotonous in that sense. I was excited to see a movie with the archangel Gabriel as the main character, but I feel like the film could have been a lot more epic given the subject matter."
1,Gabriel,"This is possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen. The script was bad, the acting horrible, and the directing abysmal. Save you money!"
3,"Service was great-movie, not so much!",I ordered this movie on another person's recommendation and have to admit that I was not impressed. The service and the ordering process it took to get it was excellent though. The movie arrived as ordered and it was in excellent condition.It was just not a great movie.
5,Gabriel Excellent right up to the end,"I bought this movie and I loved it. It was everything that the summary described and then some. When watching the movie by the end I couldn't believe who Michael was. It was a shock, it keeps you guessing if he is alive or dead. Andy Whitfield and the rest them are excellent actors they change up and give their own story behind the light and darkGabriel"
4,a new cult classic,"This is a dark tale of loyalty, truth and heartache. Gabriel is sure to be a cult classic. The film's style is similar to sin city, but the plot is not lost in the action. A great film."
4,"Dark, intense, and overall quite good","I saw a preview for this movie when I was checking previews on a movie rental service. I love good vs evil plots and I was intrigued with the whole idea of this movie. I was surprised with how dark it was at first but I thought the acting was well done and the storyline was very good. I thought they could have went into the characters a little more, but it is quite understandable since they had such a low budget. If you love the Matrix, Underworld, Blade movies then it is quite possible this movie is for you. I will watch it again."
3,Gabriel DVD,"Not the best movie ever done, but not the worst either. No exactly what I was expecting. Needs more something."
3,little disappointed,"A little too depressing, even for me! I kept expecting this movie to turn around and be better than just ok but it never did. Not a total loss though, Andy Whitfield was right for the part of Gabriel. I miss him, He had so much potential."
3,Sexing the future,"If this movie was linked with religious stories, a reviewer is short of a comment for simply not knowing anything related with/of.""Good angels"" had been converted into ""dark angels"" while experiencing realities of a real life in a real city on the Earth-and this conversion brought about illusive personal freedom from subversive existence in a divine paradise.Sex and personal physical superiority are the most such converts exercise.Movie itself is a set of scenes mixing swearing, sci-fi, actions and copulating, where ""good"" differs from ""bad"" a little, and simply sexy actors play explicitly sexist characters just viewer time to pass by."
2,Poor Plot and Setting,This movie has a very poor plot and unbelievable story line that lends itself to the barely made it thru watching it category. It's dark and dreary and uninspiring. I'm not sure why it has received so many good reviews.
3,NOT BAD,THE REAL REASON I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE? ANDY WHITFIELD. LOVED SPARTACUS AND WANTED TO SEE MORE OF HIM. HOPE HE'S GETTING BETTER.
1,Total Crap,"Where do I even begin? Bad acting, bad story, totally implausible. Angels taking human form, cursing, smoking, drinking, fornicating, taking God's name in vain? NO WAY!! An all powerful, all knowing God doesn't ""know"" what's going on in purgatory? NO WAY!! I could so kick myself for watching this movie. Waste of time and money!"
3,Eleven years old but still relevant,"This book was written just after the wild ride of the 80s and before the dismal days of downsizing in the 90s. Interestingly, the author makes a distinction between ""shopaholics"" (they're okay) and ""shopping addicts"" (big-time trouble). Still, she makes the link between shopping and love - a quest to be recognized, even by store clerks.The content seems simplistic by today's standards, but it still has a ring of truth in it.I wonder what the author's take is on the growing 'simplicity' movement. As a newcomer to this line of thought, the idea that a shopaholic is okay is appalling to me."
4,Cute but not as well made as the apparel,"My daughter got this set for Easter last year and just adores it, esp. the umbrella which she uses any possible time she can. I wouldn't say it's cheaply made but it's just not as well made as the raincoat. The little ""button"" on top to finish popped off within a month and can't really be glued back on. It doesn't affect the umbrella's use but it's just one of those annoying things."
2,SO CUTE! But not durable.....,"I have several Kidorable umbrellas that I got directly from their website. I only have one that hasn't broken down in any way. I have duct tape on one, holes in another, and the frog eye is coming off the wire. At least two of them (maybe three) don't even close correctly anymore without me putting tape on the little piece of metal that is supposed to push in.I was really disappointed in the quality of these umbrellas. Here in Utah, it's not like we get that much rain, so they don't get used a whole lot. My kids love them, though, and think they are so cute. I think they are adorable, too. I just wish they held up better."
5,Great sturdy adorable umbrella,"I can't believe how sturdy this umbrella is and so incredibly cute too! Haven't used it in high winds yet, but think it will definitely hold up!"
5,Adorable,"This is a very cute little umbrella for kids. The color is exactly like the picture, kind of muted, but it is still very cute. Any child who loves dinosaurs will love this!"
1,Lawyer talk,"The book was written by a lawyer who wanted to make money on the cops backs and he does it with the wrong facts and figures, its self serving"
4,Revolution and after.,"A high placed officer looses his job after the Nasser revolution of 1952 in Egypt, because during his office he received some 'presents', as nearly everybody in some places did.His lover leaves him. He cuts all ties with his acquaintances, becomes an alcoholic, fathers a child with a prostitute but doesn't recognize it. Will he, after all, escape out of the prison of his previous life and make the jump to a new one?Read this beautiful story about "" ... quail ... swooping in to land exhausted at the end of their long, predestined, illusory heroic flight.""A reflection on the impact of a national revolution on the life of a citizen."
4,A Japanese girl growing up alone.,"""Shizuko's daughter"" is basically about how a twelve years old Japanese girl, Yuki, growing up alone after her mother had died and her father had married the other woman. She lives with her aunt, Aya, and learn how to live with herself. Her whole life has been changing and changing as she gets older. She always wanted to be like her mother, Shizuko, brave and smart. In fact, she is a smart girl and very brave, maybe better than her own mother in some days. I think this is a very good book that I will highly recommended. It's very interesting."
5,Probably the best novel I've ever read.,"I picked this up when I was in 8th grade a t a book fair because it sounded interesting. It's beautifully written and I've never read something that touched me this much. Even now that I'm 15, It's still my favorite. I've given it to several people to read. I can't tell you how great it is. It's made for young readers but any adult with sense will enjoy this novel immensly. There is no way to describe the greatness so buy it, please. Another book that you may like if you like this is Jacob Have I Loved. It's also young adult(which I usually hate), but it's wonderful. I can't beleive how I love Shizuko's Daughter. I'm going to buy Kyoko Mori's other books today because her talnet is profound."
1,slow plot development and striking ending,when i picked up the book as a air plane novel. i had no idea how boring it would be. the charactors were deep in one way but just sprang up incredably short in a view long term. this book to put it kindly was distastfull. mabey next time kyoko best luck to you in the feuture
3,"Very descriptive, but there was not one page turning part.","This book was beautifully, with too much agonizing detail. The book, I could have put down and not read, but I had to for school. The book was kind of confusing But the characters were well involved, and that was good, I don't think it was 5 star material"
5,A story of hope,"Yuki Okuda was only twelve years old when her mother, Shizuko, comitted suicide. Such a shock left a big impact on the young Yuki's outlook on life. When she was only thirteen, a year later, her father married another woman, Hanei. (Yuki's father had been seeing Hanei from when her mother had been alive)Yuki and Hanei never managed to get along very well, and Hanei found Yuki as a spoiled brat. Yuki changed from the cheery, happy child she once was to a solemn, sober young woman who was always serious. Yuki thought that love brought pain and she never wanted to experience it again. This book tells of Yuki's life through different years in every chapter and also tell the story through other family member's eyes. You get to see Hanei's view in a chapter, Shizuko's view before she comitted suicide and many other characters who are vital in the story. Yuki undergoes a growth of strength and hope, and learns that sometimes to achieve joy you must first endure pain."
2,no conforme,I bought two controls which one worked perfectly and the other failure is not as good the price is not cheap but low quality
2,Not For The Serious CNC Builder,"I was hoping for a book that would give usefull information on the compoments and construction of a quality CNC router. This book didn't even come close. This is a documentation of cobbeling together a make-shift CNC router and does not give any real info on how to choose components or lay out and build a serious machine.If, like me, you are looking for detailed help on choosing linear motion components, stepper or servo motors and controllers, and how to design and build a machine that can approximate the quality of the pre-built routers costing $10,000 and up this is NOT the book for you. Don't waste your money!"
2,Still looking,"I admire Geoff's energy and enthusiasm but after consideration, decided not to duplicate his efforts.His first enthusiasm is in creating his own electronics driver for his CNC router. I found a number of commercially available units for sale for less than the cost of the parts, and they have more function. I'll spend my time on the mechanics. As for a first machine his mechanics is a big step up. I have reviewed other publications and web sites and have found that foraging for information and ideas, for me, then designing my own machine, is the way to go.This is an opportunity for Amazon buy back."
1,CNC Robotics; Build Your Own,"There is a lot missing from this book. You will not learn much, it a bunch of do this and do that no reason for anything. A big waste your's and my money ."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Thankfully, I checked this book out from the library rather than parting with any of my hard-earned cash. This is definitely a testament to the old saying ""don't judge a book by its cover."" To be honest, I haven't read the whole book. I just scanned through everything, and all of the above comments seem to fit perfectly. Much of the information seems to be either too technical or too vague. I really want to learn some CNC basics and some fundamentals of how to construct a DIY CNC machine, not how to print my own circuit boards or how the author was able to cobble together his machine from some junk parts of some rare camera. Don't get me wrong, there is some good information in here. I guess I just need a little more hand-holding at this point."
5,Great Book,"I am very pleased with this book. The author seems to be a regular guy who likes to build things and so am I. I liked all the information about the electronics, when it comes to that sort of task i can use all the help I can get. I now have working driver boards that I have used to move some small stepper motors with my computer. I am using the rest of the book as inspiration for the machine that I'm building. This is a project book so if you like to build things from the ground up you'll love it."
3,I really wanted to love these shoes but...,"I thought they looked adorable (in the picture) as well as high quality (from Bandolino) so I bought them. But they feel and look like plastic. The sole is some kind of molded plastic (like summer beach toys!) and mine has scratches on it. So beware it will scratch with wear and will not be able to be repaired.The leather is not soft as it usually is in expensive shoes and also feels plastic-like.The inner shoe is silver--which is not attractive to me-I'd prefer it to be black. So, I am not really impressed with them but I only paid $29. If you are looking for expensive soft leather uppers, then this shoe is not for you. I swear--the Irvington Wedge shoe looks like something they sell in Wal-mart or K-mart, that is how cheap it looks!"
2,Misleading title,"This ""series"" is really just a collection of History Channel series episodes bundled together to create the impression that it is a comprehensive history series covering the empires of the ancient world. The set includes individual episodes come from HC's ""Engineering An Empire""(e.g., Greece, Age of Alexander, The Aztecs, etc.), HC's ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire"", ""Ancients Behaving Badly"", and ""Barbarians"". If you are expecting a presentation of even a good historical survey of each of the major empires of the world, you will be disappointed. If only the History Channel would actually produce in depth history series', but alas, we are stuck with ""Ice Road Truckers"" and other such nonsense."
1,beaware,"This is a fine product but it is just a collection of old series, I.E Ancients behaving badly,Rome Rise and fall of an Empire,Barbarians,Engineering an empire with extras Rome and Egypt Engineering an Empire, I think this should be made much more clear when advertising this product."
3,Good series overall,"Some of the graphics in Ancients Behaving Badly are animated and quite cheesy. The Barbarians part was filmed in eastern Europe so do not be surprised if the Huns and Mongols which are Asian tribes are portrayed by actors with caucasian features. On the other hand, the series as a whole was quite captivating not just for my husband who is into military history but for me as well."
5,fast and reliable,"This item came very quickly, and the item was in brand new condition just as advertised. I would use this buyer again."
3,worked fairly well,I ordered this drano max but received drano gel. So i guess my review is on drano gel which seemed to slightly increase the speed of my sink draining. It would have been nice to receive the correct product
2,Fails here,"The pale rider death stalks these two related romances of an Indian ( Native American Princess) maid's loving and her loverand of Rene , the Frenchman fleeing his sins to the sentimental ends of the earth and somehow in the end he finds a measure of peace.The great poetry in French prose needs a better English translation?Here it just tended to be boring.I hear deep oboe notes... long and deep and sad for love.And as in a Shakespeare play, they sigh as long for love as a Cyrano without a sword."
2,Golden Empire,"I have always been an avid fan of Ms Lowell, and when I came across Golden Empire, I happily settled in to have a good read. This books takes you through extreme emotions, I came to feel sorry for a family of three generations that lived with bad choices, and bitterness that destroyed everyone in it. So be it, some families are like that, but when Ms Lowell introduced an incestous relationship, I was unsettled to say the least. She promoted a relationship that to me is imoral as well as illegal, I had a hard time finishing the book, and was unsettled by it for days. I am appalled that an author of her magnatude and influence, would even suggest such a relationship is proper."
3,Not bad,"If you're looking for escapism, this is it. The big problem was it felt like there was no one to root for and that's what I like in my books. I was creeped out by the last couple in the book. It doesn't matter how it was glossed over: it was still creepy. And it all just ended on a down note. I know some people are OK with that, but that's not why I read these kinds of books."
2,Not Worth the Time and Money...,"I bought this, as it was an early publication of Elizabeth Lowell.The characters were one-dimensional and inspired no emotional involvement of this reader.Unless you are an avid Elizabeth Lowell, Ann Maxwell, A.E. Maxwell fan, I do not recommend you purchase this book."
3,So-so,"I'm not a great connoisseur of these things, but I have bought three of these, and two have proved to be unusable, as I just can't get the ink to flow through properly. (The ballpoints are even worse.) I love the look of them, but I'm getting very frustrated. Time to move on."
2,Like writing with a watercolor brush.,"I purchased one of these pens (same color, medium nib) from an office supply chain in a gift box with multiple color inks, converter, and bottle of ink. I used the black cartridge ink for starters. The pen is an insanely smooth writer, but the ink flow was extremely high, it was like writing with a felt-tipped marker or watercolor brush. Let me be clear, it wasn't leaking all over the place, it was just consistently delivering too much ink for clear writing using font that would fit on a ""college ruled"" line. I tried generic notebook paper and a page in a Moleskin, no difference. I'll grant that it could have been a lot specific issue, but I promptly returned the pen. I had high hopes (as I was lusting over this pen a bit), but it wasn't worth the ~$55.00 I spent."
5,308 Custom dies,The Hornady custome dies are of great value. They are of the best quality that you can purchase. I would recommend that anyone looking for quality would purchase Hornady products.
4,Good for new moms,I would recommend this video for new moms who have never breastfeed before. It shows real moms breastfeeding their babies and discusses typical problems you may run into and what to do about them.
5,Very Informative,This is a great breastfeeding video. I was a little unsure about it but when I recieved it I popped it in and it was a great video. It showed actual video of women breastfeeding. it covers everything you can think of in good detail and even has a section for Fathers-to-be and what they can do to help plus it gives contact information for more information and help in breastfeeding... It shows several different ways to do things as well. A great video for anyone looking for a overveiw of everything you would want to know about breastfeeding.... And it is very positive giving you confidence almost to the point that you look forward to breaast feeding.
3,Does the Job,"This product was smaller than I expected - the base is less than 7 inches tall, but it does do the job, and it has a very unique look to it that I enjoy!"
5,For my Cherokee,"As described, very pleased. Note; getting the old one out was pure hell, the original stud and mating hole in the center link are tapered. The new stabilizer accounts for this with the needed adapter making for a very easy install."
2,Did not fit my application and item could use some improvement.,"I bought this for a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee which this SS should fit and it doesn't work.The bolt supplied for the Jeep application is not long enough when needed to use the lock washer.The tapered sleeve is useless as it cannot fit within the opening of the bracket on the tie rod sleeve.Also, it should include a bellow to protect it. You cannot even use the original one to modify it.Overall, it was a waste of time and money and I am out of my return window so i'm SOL."
4,James Bond In Love?,"The title to my review alludes, quite obviously, to a comparison with the Shakespeare In Love/George Lucas In Love film-making. Having said that, it isn't so obvious and imposing in this film. This fun, period jape of a movie supposedly tells the story of Ian Flemming and how he came to devise the ingenious Bond character we all know today. For sure, the Casino Royale references are obvious (although I hate the comedy version of James Bond in the Peter Sellers version - utter garbage!) and there are other little tidbits of 'Bond' especially at the begining. This is a fun movie to watch, but I feel this is more of a romatic view of Ian Flemming, with a lot of 'poetic licence' taken. What the hell, it is a lot of fun. The period sets and acting - very stiff-upper-lip-British, old boy - is spot on. Fact or fiction? Heck enjoy the story and who cares!"
4,A must for James Bond/Fleming fans.,"A fast paced entertaining video biography of the late Ian Fleming (author of the original James Bond novels and short stories). Having read several actual biographies on Fleming, one should be cautioned that much of the peripheral info in this film has been reverse incorporated from the later Bond FILMS into this video. Fleming, I believe, only saw one Bond film (Dr. No) and died during or just following the shooting of the second (From Russia with Love). The fascinating part would be knowing just how much information came from Sean Connery to his son Jason to play this role (Ian Fleming). Sean Connery and Ian Fleming hit it off quite well at the start of the Bond series, and because of Goldfinger - Connery actually started playing golf!"
5,The Amazing Ian Flemming,"If you have not read any of Ian Flemmings books, this movie is the best way to see how The James Bond character came to fruition. Excellent movie to top off your James Bond collection and who better to play the role of Ian Flemming than the son of one of most well loved Bonds of them all Sean Connery. Jason Connery is superb. This movie is a gem."
5,Ian Fleming Biography,"Very unique video on life of Ian Fleming - where the James Bond series came from. Never upgraded to a DVD, so VHS or nothing. Only film I'm aware of starring Jason Connery vs his father (the star of the original James Bond movies)."
3,Trim to fit,"These are trim to fit mats. I tried them but still didn't like the fit. Went with Weathertechs instead for more custom fit. Quality is good, just not happy with trim to fit style."
3,Not Custom,"I think the greatest frustration in shopping for this type of product is verifying a custom fit design. I was lead to believe this was a custom fitted product - NOT SO! While this is well made of heavy rubber, it is a generic design that requires trimming to get an OK but not perfect fit."
1,NOT CUSTOM FIT!!!,"This speaks for itself. The packaging SAYS UNIVERSAL FIT, and they are way too big for the back of my 4Runner."
3,Didnt Fit,"These did not fit my 2005 Toyota 4Runner back seats, even if I trimmed them all the way down. I returned them and got a different set that covers the entire back seat.I still gave it 3 stars because the actual mats themselves were of good quality. I have a similar set for my front seats and they have worked perfectly."
2,Slow and uninteresting...,"Normally I don't even bother to review books I don't like, but I really wanted to enjoy this book and was disappointed. Having recently read Edward Cline's ""Sparrowhawk"" books I have become more interested in the early days of American history, so when I read the back cover of this book I got my hopes up for some good reading and some historical information... I ended up with neither one.This is a rather dull, slow-moving mystery starting with a ghastly whipping scene. The characters never get developed to the point where the reader can actually care about them and there are some characters who play pivital roles who aren't developed at all... they just kind of pop in and out of the story as needed. I found it a bit confusing.As an additional note the author seems to think naturalism is the same as historical fiction. It is not."
5,SITH,"I like the Count Dooku lightsaber. But the blade does't go in all the way.I have Obi-wans saber two,but i need Anakins. I also have a basic green saber and a basic red saber. Count Dookus lightsaber lights really good. So go get this toy."
2,warning,it might sound like a good thing but the blade dosn't retract all the way and the handle is tooooo long and wide
5,Great handle,"This saber is excellent. I bought it because I couldn't find Anakin/Luke's saber and was pleasantly surprised. I thought the handle (because it is curved) would be awkward and uncomfortable. But the handle is the best part! It is so easy to swing around the saber to fight off other fans in line. The handle makes it easy to switch from a jabbing position to a hacking grip. The red blade also looks pretty cool. It may cost more, but the comfortable, easy-to-use and cool-looking handle is worth it."
5,This is the best toy in the world!,Me and my friend had heard good things about these toys.In one day we earned forty bucks(20 for each of us)and bought them.She got Annikans and I got Count Dooko. Mine is awesome. i love the it curves in your hand.You need to buy them.Trust me!
5,How gooooood?,"The Count Dooku lightsaber is GREAT. Unlike the Episode 1 lightsabers the Episode 2 ones are BETTER and CHEAPER!!!! The sounds are very movie-like, the details in the lightsaber are great,and the blade extends about the size of the movie's lightsaber. The only downside is that the blade doesn't completely close into the handle like the ones with no sounds...). Besides that the lightsaber is GREAT."
3,This saber is a definate bummer,Ok well this sword is a total bummer. Ya i agree with all the other writers about how its fun to use because of its funky shapes but i've come up with a big problem with it. Whenever you uses this sword it sort of unscrews itself. So went im fighting it twists back and makes fighting a real pain... I mean i playing with one of my friends when suddenly it twists back and the bulb goes out. I do not reccomend this toy to anyone except for the freaks that camped outside of the movie theaters to see episode 2. I mean come on its fun but do we really need to get that obsessive?
3,Great product - bad smell,"I have been using these sticks for many years and they do a great job of helping to keep your face from getting razor burn from daily shaving. Really fantastic, but......The Swiss company that manufactures these sticks decided to ""improve"" the scent. I was revolted when I tried the new ones from Remington (seems exactly the same as the ones from Parks/Eltron which I have also tried) with the white/red/blue cap. The increase of 'parfum' is too much and just stinks - imho. What used to be a pleasant experience first thing in the morning has turned into a trial. I keep thinking I'll get used to it but I never have. Hmmm.....maybe noseplugs.I would not recommend buying these in bulk, (as I used to do) until you've tried one to see if you can handle the smell.If you like what this stick does, but not the smell get Derma Bloc's Pre Shave Powder Stick. It's great, but without the intense smell."
1,french edition ????,"hi,Since I had read ""le matin des magiciens"" by pauwells (5 years ago) , I'm looking for a french edition of the book of the damned.would you please inform me if you know where i could find it??"
5,An excellent and hilarious classic!,"This is not a new book, but was written sometime around the turn of century and has been considered a classic on most 'required reading' lists. A spoof on the awe in which society holds the Holy Writs of the scientific community, the author marshalled an impressive army of established, documented facts for which the official scientific explanations are simply absurd. A 'must read' for anyone who believes science teaches The Truth -- or for anyone who suspects otherwise."
3,An intetesting listing,"Going from Abbeville to York, house of, the volume provides brief information on people, places, etc. It can be a useful quick reference to look for an individual of that period of time, but is mostly a starting point if you are engaged in research. There is a useful map defining areas like Aquitaine, Poitou, Swabia, etc., and some portraits and illustrations.The ""family tree"" type chart is not complete and can be a bit misleading. Actual lines of descent form a spider's web. For example, Joan, Fair Maid of Kent, married Sir Thomas Holland prior to marrying Edward, the Black Prince. A son from the prior marriage, Sir Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent, had a daughter who married John Beaufort (son of John of Gaunt) giving the Beauforts legitimate descent from Edward I, in addition to their Lancaster descent."
5,WOW!!!,"David Henderson has a better understanding of today's culture than most college philosophy professors. He provides awesome insight of how to reach out to people who believe God is absent from their lives, and draw them into Christianity. The book also forces the reader to evaluate the sincerity of his own faith."
1,Outdated materials,I take my copy and go to the specified business/address andfind they are no longer there. This was true on 3 out of 5entries. Needs to be updated or removed from circulation.
5,We all need this book,"This book is the best book I have read regarding the mind. I underlined most of it. I highly recommend this author's works, especially this book. Lots of food for thought and guidelines for improving thought life. Received the book as promised and in the condition as stated. Recommend seller."
3,better than many,"This book is one of the better books on spirituality, not the best but one of the better. It has heaps of good ideas, thoughts and wisdom. every pages is a new insight. The drawback for me was that it was too much on ideas , so many that I could be thinking too much after about it.I cannot be hard on this book because as I say compared to most others on the market these days it is very good."
3,Freud D1040W Diablo 10-1/4-Inch 40 Tooth ATB,"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Freud blades, having used them in a variety of saws for years. I've only been able to find 2 blades to fit my Skil Bigfoot saw and bought this one based on Freud's reputation. I only wish Amazon included in its product info that the blade is VERY thin-kerf, to the extent that the blade will sometimes deviate from its normal path if you try to correct your cut line without going back to the very beginning of the cut and starting absolutely straight with the line. There's definitely a place for thin-kerf blades, but I wish Freud had used a slightly heavier gauge steel for the blade body."
2,freud d1040w,This blade is not all its cracked up to be.. Don't get me wrong.... I love diablo blades for my skil saws but this one for the bigfoot sucks! The thin kerfed blade warps and bends under normal conditions. They shouldnt of use a thin kerfed blade for this application. just my 2 cents.Freud D1040W Diablo 10-1/4-Inch 40 Tooth ATB General Purpose Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch and Diamond Knockout Arbor
4,FREUD 10 1/4 INCH 40 TOOTH purchased from AMAZON,"USED THE BLADE ON MY MILWAUKEE 10 1/4 CIRCULAR SAW, CUTS THRU THE 4 x 4 EASILY BUT I WAS CUTTING 12 DEGREE WEDGES WHICH I THINK WAS WHY THE BLADE FLEXES IN AND OUT, NOT A PROBLEM EXCEPT IT DIDN'T GIVE ME A STRAIGHT CUT. IT ALSO MADE THE SAW ONE OF THE QUIETEST CIRCULAR SAWS I EVER USED. I REPLACED THE THIN CURF FREUD BLADE WITH THE HEAVIER BLADE THAT CAME WITH THE SAW AND I GOT BETTER RESULTS, AND WILL KEEP THE THIN BLADE TO MAKE STRAIGHT PERPENDICULAR CUTS AND TRY USING A REGULAR CURF FREUD 10 INCH BLADE."
1,ULTRA-THIN blade makes this useless,"I like Freud blades as well, but this one is really thin - the blade will resonate so much while starting a cut that it is truly alarming. I can watch the blur of the teeth at the end of the blade become 1/4"" wide (no exaggeration), and I'm afraid that the whole thing will self-destruct into shrapnel. I eventually tossed it into the recycle bin, because even if it wasn't a safety concern, it's impossible to make an accurate cut in timbers with this blade. I have had much better luck with the factory replacement blade from Big Foot. Don't waste your money on this paper-thin toy."
2,Odd,A very odd book......strange story and no real resolution. I slogged all the way through it while being tempted to give up on it before I reached the end. I wish I had given up.
5,yummy,this one is great i bought since it has cucumber notes and perfect for hot summers and the cucumber isnt even the best part it transforms into a mouth watering masculine fresh scent i get so many compliments
5,Study guide,"I have not read this book, but I caution other shoppers that I believe this is the study guide to the main text and not a paperback edition of the original. I'm not sure about this, but the price matches those on other web sites for the paperback edition of the study guide (which bears the same name). Be careful."
5,Works Great,Part worked great - fixed my interior light problem. Price was a lot less than what the dealer wanted - appears to be OEM part.
3,tHE bOOK wAZ AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,This book waz good & intresting espessicaly the part when steven starts missing cathy.I hate Jill hale in the book as she thinks she is really pretty & poupular &every guy is dieing to go out with her.I also do not like steven as he did not care about cathy who waz his girlfriend when Jill rejected him.Steven also does not think that first Jill wanted to go with Joe &now him.I feel soory for Cathy as Steven left her not even thinking how she would feel.If i waz Cathy i would also forget about steven& not acept his apology& go out with some other guy but Cathy is nice & she is the best charecter in the play.......
2,Error and no support,Purchased 5 weeks ago. After installing it came up with an error. Have used the online chat and email support and have gotten nowhere. They are currently ignoring my emails and I am sending a letter to the VP of support to try and get their attention.
1,Blue screen of death bad_pool_header - no help from norton,The title says it all. Every time I try to do a backup to an external usb drive with 450G or space I get a blue screen and the bad_pool_header error. NO help with out cash at Symantec. I have XP Pro with 2M of ram.
3,"Good when it works, terrible when it doesn't",This product installed and worked properly on my new Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit PC. It was the first item installed after the Windows load.This product would not install on my fully loaded Windows XP Pro PC. I jumped through all the hoops and it still would not work.
4,"SO FAR, SO GOOD",What a improvement over ghost 10.0 I like this version for being a inexpensive home backup & the fact I like not having to do whole system backup all at once as with ver.10.0. Watch for the rebates. Some are quite good.
4,Good product for typical users,"I bought this to backup my hard drive to a USB drive, which it will do but unforently it will not make that drive bootable even though it backs up the MSB. E-mailed and call sysmantec and they were of no help so I now have a back up of my drive but can't boot from it if my main drive dies.Yes, I can boot from other USB drives, no problem."
3,Recomended by Dell,"I've been having mega problems with my Dell desktop XPS700. I've spent 3 days with Tech support with no success. Dell said I need this program after they upgrade motherboard to 720. I may haveto reformat and reload all OS and programs. I will use Ghost to backup my HD after I get the computer running smooth again. According to Dell (which has a license for all their computers) it will take only 20 minutes for Ghost to load all my software after a crash etc.I've reviewed the instalation brochure. This program will not be user freindly to install. I'm very pessamistic that Gohst will work as advertised. If it does Ghost will be woth every penny and time it takes to set up. The last Dell tower had HD failure 3 times.I'm rating this program based on the very complicated install, and the possibility that it works."
3,norton ghost 12,"Complicated to set up. Not especially user friendly, and no explicit directions. Not nearly as simple as version 9. After initial installation it seemed to work, but then after a day or so, it interfered with a number of other applications and seems to have totally corrupted the registry. Fortunately I had a workable restore point. Took me hours to uninstall it. Unfortunately I have had this problem with virtually all Norton products to the point that I won't touch any of them in the future. The programs seem to want to take over my computer and really mess things up. I now use Acronis 10 which is easy to set up, has excellent directions and is user friendly.Note that I gave the product 3 stars -- that was in error. I should have given it 1 star."
1,Corrupted my System,"A corrupt file of Norton's corrupted my system including the keyboard driver. Their tech support in India blamed me saying I had installed Ghost incorrectly. What I could possibly have done that would have resulted in corrupt files, he didn't say. He was supposed to upgrade my problem & someone would call me back, but no one ever did.I tried reinstalling my keyboard driver, but couldn't get rid of Ghost before it had again corrupted my system. Had to reinstall XP. Luckily I had my backup that had been created the day before. It took two days, but I'm back in business and will never again purchase a Norton/Symantec product.P.S. There seems to be no way to give a product zero stars."
4,Nice Guide for the system,"This guide made the installation of the Tite-Joint fasteners very easy. Same exact products that other vendors and woodworking stores sell for twice as much. Metal is a bit weak, so be careful not to force it too much as it can bend."
4,A must for using the joint fasteners,I purchased 2 of the fasteners - to make my life easier i also bought this template and the drill bit. All well worth the few dollars they cost.
2,"Be warned ,, grip is hard to install ... to small and stock screws have a hard time threading",to small and stock screws have a hard time threadingTaurus PT92u will be working on it all night !!!
3,Look great but difficult,These look great on my Taurus PT-92 but where difficult to put on the gun. The grips are so tight and are hard to get it to go around the gun. I also had to drill the holes out a bit because the grips are thicker than the originals and the screws are to short to fit. But if u can deal with a little work they look great and its hard to find grips like this for the PT92 due to the safty not being on the slide and on the frame instead like beretta. difficult
5,Excellent grip but it helps if you have big hands . . .,"I've had this grip on my PT92 for about five years and love it. They give the pistol a totally different look than those rubbish plastic panels the gun had from the factory. They promptly went in the trash when I installed the Pachmayr set. The only complaint I have is that they could be slimmer than they are. Despite that, I still think it's a fantastic product. I wear a size small/medium glove to give you an idea of where I'm coming from. If you have big hands then it won't bother you. My brother has bigger hands than I do and he quite likes the larger grip. It's very classy looking with the brass logo in the middle of the panels too. Suffice it to say, my pistol turns a lot of heads."
5,best putter,I switched to the arrow after having some putting trouble and it took about 4-6 strokes off my game. It took a couple of weeks to get used to but once I got comfortable with it my putting became very consistent from 20ft or less. Trick is to put index finger on outside lip. Straight as an arrow :-)
4,The only rubber molding source,"This is the only source I have ever found for non-commercial molding of rubberlike compounds. While this 1986 edition does not address possible new developments in this area (Loctite now sells material which appears to be the same as the Devcon product highlighted in the book), it is the only information I have ever seen on creating rubber parts for the home hobbyist and restorer. The chapter on weights and volumes is valuable, as these materials are rather expensive. The metal casting section is similar to others on the market, and is primarily focused on sand casting of aluminum. This limited focus, skimming over most other methods and materials, limits it to a four star rating. If you want to mold rubber parts though, this is IT."
4,"Excellent book, easy to understand. Good buy for the $11","An amateur can quickly learn casting techniques to make small and simple metal and rubber parts by following examples and illustrations in this book. The Make it yourself foundry equipments chapter is helpful for beginner to start with this hobby without spending too much money. However, the main technique presented is sand casting, there is not enough examples or info on other casting techniques."
5,Great resource,"This book teaches anyone how tocreate molds and cast their own parts.Making things yourself is very rewarding,and it's a skill that is invaluable."
4,book review,"This is another good book. In my model, one of the rubber tyres of the car that I was constructing from an expensive DIY kit got lost and another badly damaged. Many years later, I rediscovered the kit. The tips in this book were useful in getting it all together. I recommend this book before starting on any such adventure. I have given it a four star rating for usefulness and easy reading."
3,Book review,I felt the information was rather old. I'm still looking for a reference I can actually use.
2,Smallish,It turned out much smaller than it said. I'm usually a Medium in woman's sizes and an x-large in juniors and this x-large won't fit me at all.
3,"Cancer scare, a bit overstated.","The supposed carcinogen in play sand is Crystalline Silica, which is essentially...sand. Most commonly it's quartz. The warning occurs because if it is pounded into a powder (as is often the case in its heavy construction applications) and then inhaled, it has certainly been linked to types of lung cancer. A sandbox, however, is a long way from stone cutting or sand blasting. None the less, the State of California requires the cancer warning on all items containing Crystalline Silica. [...]You should certainly buy products that your are comfortable with your kids playing in, and Safesand with no Crystalline Silica (see other reviews) is a wonderful product, but my wife is a doctor and we buy our kids sand at Home Depot."
2,Check out the price of Shipping!!,"I ordered two bags of this sand to go with the naturally playful summertime sandbox and paid no attention to the shipping cost until it was too late. I paid for alot of shipping and not much sand. Don't make the same mistake just go to your local garden center. Also, shipping is very slow....obviously because of the weight. Although, the covenience of having the sand brought to your front door might be worth it to you."
4,Don't go to your local hardware store,Read the fine print on any sand you buy from a hardware store. It all contains chemcials that cause cancer.. even if it's labled childrens sand it's still not safe.. make sure to read the fine print.http://www.safesand.com/information.htm
4,Its Funny,"Violeta is a know-it-all girl that lives sometimes with her father, and sometimes with her mom. She keeps on solving all her familys troubles with her 'great intelligence'. It's very funny, especially her brother Sidney."
5,Great Album,I got this album from my sister two weeks ago while on vacation. This was the only CD that we played the rest of our vacation because this was such an awesome CD. Their music is energetic and good to listen to. Plus you don't have to worry about profanity in this music. This is a great album to buy!!!
5,"Likeable Reading, Likeable Characters",A friend recommended this book when I spoke of an interesting article in a recent New Yorker magazine about bail bondsmen and so I purchased it here at Amazon.com. I had planned on reading a couple of chapters before going to bed but instead read the entire book in an evening (late). It was very easy reading and the characters were interesting and likeable. I feel certain that they were based on real people that the author encountered in researching the book. This short novel provides an interesting insight into these fascinating underworld characters.
4,Review of Fugitives on the Run,"I truly enjoyed reading this fast-moving, rapid-paced novella. I can't wait to read the next book. The author writes with real enthusiasm and his descriptions help you to visualize the characters. Definitely a one-nighter! Can't put it down until you have completed the book!"
5,Great for all ages,"I really enjoyed reading Chun Yu's ""Little Green."" It gives a unique perspective of the Chinese cultural revolution from a young child's view, but at the same time explores very mature themes of cultural and personal identity. As a student of history, this book gave me a new understanding of the crazy times of the cultural revolution -- while creating a sense of beauty and wonder through the free verse structure of the book. I'd highly recommend it."
5,A New Voice,This book powerfully tells what life was truly like under Mao and his cohort. Chun Yu brings a new voice with an amazing ability to enable the reader to imagine life inside China during the Cultural Revolution.This is a fresh and new voice to the history of that era.PS I am not a kid although submitting a review as a child is easier as there is no password stuff to climb through.
5,Little Green: Growing Up During the Chinese Cultural Revolution,"In Little Green, it is wonderful how the author captures her childhood, the feeling of childhood in general, her family and surroundings and experiences, and finally her young perception of the Cultural Revolution in beautiful and poetic, yet simple language. I knew about the Red Guards and so on, but I had never before read anything about how children were indoctrinated during that time. Little Green is an endearing childhood memoir."
4,Falco novels,I'm a big fan of this series and this character. I expect this book to be as good as Davis' last.
4,Fellow Travelers,"If you accept the framework of this ""novel"" as a shadow of Armond Hammer,""Fellow Travelers"" becomes a wonderful historical trip, in easy going style. I'm interested in business personalities; Hammer being among the allusive. I liked this origional book a lot!"
3,STOOGES,I Love The Stooges. Though this has alot of episodes they aren't all your typical stooge clips. The first 5 or 6 dics are kinda like a retrospect of the Stooges with weird music that truly takes away from that Stooge experience. If you are not looking for the Sunday morning Stooge experience then this could survice but I must say I was a little disappointed. There still are plenny of laughs to be had but somehow it didn't do it for me like the Stooges originals.
1,GET THE 3 STOOGES COLLECTION: This set does not include all release,"Buyer Beware: This is an older set of stooges films. The problem is you do NOT get all of thier features and the quality is not so great. I suggest you search The Three Stooges Collection that began release a about 4 years ago. Sony remastered ALL 190 shorts that the Three Stooges are famous for. The first DVD was release in October 2007 with the final one in June 2010. Sony spent an enormous amount of time remastering each one and released them in sequential order. There are 8 volumes in all. There is NO other collection except for the Three Stooges collection that have release all 190 shorts, so, do NOT buy any other collection especially the one I'm rating here. I hope the day will come where they remaster the cartoons, and the Motion Pictures they made."
5,The Only Set You Need to Own:),"I'm soo crushed that they do not sell these anymore according to this page:( But, you must seek this set out if you've been looking for the perfect set. Because, believe me quit looking. No more terrible quality reproductions ever again!! I bought this set for my father-in-law for xmas and he loves it!! I am a stooges fan too and this one is the best!! A must have for any stooges fan!!! If you find it anywhere buy it!! On the down side this is the only place I've found it!!"
3,Quality problems,"Overall a decent collection for the price. However, at least four of the oldest episodes had scenes very under developed or dark. Also, the cutesy lead-ins (that can not be bypassed!) are unnecessary and annoying. Several of these episodes are missing scenes. Why is this?I suspect this set includes the Shemp and Curly-Joe items to give all the heirs a taste of the royalties, because these are among the worst. We have a remake of the ""heridity vs environment"" script featuring Curly after his stroke. A clear example of how tragic this stroke was for him.Overall this set is a nice selection of early ones, but many of the better ones from the mid 30s are not included."
3,The unknown war in the corner of the Arabian peninsula.,"Mr.Schmidt sheds some light on an unknown war pitting the newly enthroned Iman al Badr against General Sallal. The Iman had the best intentions of reforming Yemeni society and even admired President Nasser of Egypt. General Sallal, the opportunist seized power with the help of massive Egyptian manpower and resources. The royalists fought back, with the help of the Saudi King. The civil war ends after this book was published, so the reader does not know the outcome of this civil war.The book details a little known war on the Arabian peninsula. Few people have heard of this war. What is known is that Nasser waged aggressive war against a poorer nation simply to put his stooges into a position of control. Kind of makes Nasser's actions in the Suez Crisis look like the hypocrite he was. For those of you needing a dose of Arab politics, this book show the double dealing nature of the Middle East."
5,My first bluetooth,This was a perfect first bluetooth for me. When I followed the instructions it works just fine. Now when I turn it on my phone automatically turns on handsfree and sends the calls to my bluetooth. It cut off a couple of my calls because it needed charging but overall it works fine.
4,Ark of the covenant review,"I found the revelations in this book staggering.It is structured in such a way that if you have prior knowledge of bible history then you are not forced to read 500 pages but can skim or miss out certain chapters.Those with a fair knowlege of the bible may feel they are paying a lot for things they already know about. However, some of the information and supporting evidence looks unique and the sources of information are given. Well presented and easy to read. Quite a balanced approach to the evidence."
4,Authoritive Witness,Mr. Gray has done extensive research and presents many different aspects that bring another strong witness of the reality of the coming of the Messiah and the eternal plan of God.
2,Only a theory!,"This book claims to have all the answers,but on reading it soon becomes obvious there is no evidence at all,like many other books i have read it say's the truth will arrive shortly but it never does,reading the book itself is hard work ,changing from one subject to another without warning,any way make your own mind up."
1,Kitty,"I was very disappointed with the book. This was much less than expected from this author . This should have been labeled as ""fluff."""
1,A major disappointment,"I have been a fan of Leigh Greenwood since my first Seven Brides book, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book. For me what had made the other books by this author so enjoyable was that the strength of the heroines was more than equal to the strenght of the hero. Here, she just allows herself to be steamrollered in their second encounter. If you want to read this author go back to her Seven Brides books (Rose, Fern, et al.) or the Cowboys (Jack, Ward, Buck, et al.)"
2,Not the soundtrack,"I ordered this and sent it back. If you're looking for a soundtrack of ""Belizaire the Cajun,"" in particular the opening and closing song, this doesn't have it. Sure, it has the song but not the performance and not the version you heard and enjoyed in the film. The film version was passionate and rhythmically complex, syncopated. The CD version is shorter, quieter, rhythmically feeble and about as passionate as a lullaby for patients in a dyspeptic ward. I got my money back for misrepresentation."
2,not what i expected,"they are pretty, and match my ginko layfayette service, but they are thin, really thin, so thin in fact that they will all most likely all end up bent... i was expecting something more in keeping with the quality of my layfayette service (which seems quite durable). would i purchase them again? no... will i return them? no... i will find something to eventually replace them with once they are all destroyed in a couple of years (?)."
1,"Pathetic; the blade is too thin, unstable, warps at high rpm","On a ROCKWELL RADIAL SAW - MODEL 438 02 314 0509 @ 3450 rpm, this blade warps dramatically, leaving nearly a "" kerf; it will naturally re-center after the cut [when not in use = spin only] but that doesn't make the actual cutting any less defective. The saw was unplugged & the blade was re-secured three separate times just to be certain that there was no problem with the installation. We've instructed to not replace this blade with another of the same, it is of no use to our firm. Once we have the refund [if not sooner], we will purchase a different blade. Sincerely, CHOSENcontract.com"
4,Very nice size tray and easily carried and passed around.,I was pleasantly surprised at the real life size of this tray. Very expensive looking with my dishes and can't really tell it's not glass if you didn't know it already. Great for carrying vegetables on or preparing for cooking jobs.Thank you again.
5,Just like the olden days,"This has really brought back the memories of childhood. This was the first rock album (vinyl of course)ever in our house, and even my parents learned to jitterbug. The album was so badly scratched you couldn't even hear it anymore, so to be able to hear the old ""Two Hound Dogs"", and ""Burn that Candle"" and the rest has been great! Clear sound and worth dancing to....if you love early rock, this is for you."
4,This is really a great dvd,"Rock around the Clock will not only bring back wonderful memories, it will lift your spirits and give you energy. I dance to the music and you will too."
5,Great 50's Jitterbug Music,"If you are into the 50's Jitterbug, you must get this album. If you are interested in early Rock & Roll, you should get this album. I had only heard Bill Haley's ""Rock Around the Clock"" song, but after seeing the movie, I wanted the soundtrack. Prior to this album, I had only heard a couple of his tunes. I was blown away by this album."
2,"Great start, but needs more","My first reaction on recieving the book was that it seemed a bit thin for the kind of information I was hoping to get. After reading the book, I found good material on the architecture of Axis, but few useful examples of how to do anything useful. It would probably have been better to wait until Axis 1.0 was released before publishing. For this book to be truely useful, I would expect it to have at least twice as much material, particulary in the Custom Handlers and Advanced Features sections. As it is, it is only slightly more helpful than the actual documentation."
4,Essential for developing a SOAP application via AXIS,"Trying to turn a legacy RMI application into a SOAP application will not happen if all you have is the Apache documentation.This book is ESSENTIAL for anyone using AXIS for developing SOAP applications, especially trying to turn a legacy application to SOAP.I found the book extremely well organized. It takes you from step 1 (installation, which has some catches to it) to the last step, holding your hand, explaining the details, explaining the rationale. And it does this efficiently. There are neither wasted words nor are there too few words.I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if I could. I would have given it 5 stars had there been an index.Although this book is written for AXIS beta one, it's still accurate for Beta two, just ignore all mention of the clutil.jar file and you've upgraded the book to beta two.Request for next version: A section on debugging the code on the server side."
4,Excellent architecture overview,Study the diagrams in this book.I found them extremely helpful to understand how Axis works and why it is different from other SOAP implementations.The book was a bit dated when I bought it - Axis is a moving target - but architecture doesn't change that quickly.
1,Better off reading Apache Axis Documentation,"I found more and better information at Axis site than from this book. What you cannot find from xml.apache.org, you cannot find in this book either."
1,One of the worst,Don't buy it. You can find more and better information from Axis web site. What a waste of time and money.
4,"British ""garage"" rock","As a fan of American garage punk (c.1964-68) I wanted to hear what their British contemperies sounded like. The UK ""Freakbeat"" may not be as loud (or intence) as what was happening in US garages but it is more melodic and, let's face it, more talented! This music, which overall sounds like a less professional version of early Beatles & Stones, doesn't really foreshadow punk rock. But it does predict the British power-pop & Mod revivelism c.79-80. A good CD for ""underground"" music historians."
1,not a book just type-os,"this could have been a very good book,but there are so many typos that it is just a mess of words and non words.the book should be under PUZZLES I can't beleive that amazon sold such a poor quality book and worst yet - I BOUGHT IT.please be smarter than i was .DON'T BUY THIS MESS!!!!!"
3,Okay for a few nights,We bought this for the holidays and it was okay for a few days. Mostly for children or teenagers. If I were buying a air bed for adults or extended stay guests I would buy the original Aerobed. We borrowed one of these as well and it was very comfortable.
1,Holes,"When this product came in the mail, it had gashes in it, like someone had taken a knife to it. This came as a surprise to me given that I have only had good experiences with Coleman products in the past. I am in the process of communicating with the company for a replacement."
5,Tmely,Series is over 30 years old but still timely to help understand what has gone wrong in the economy. It repeatedly proves with empirical evidence that results are more important than intentions.
5,Ryan Capes Rocks!,"Great Vid! I enjoyed it, I recently saw Ryan Capes on TV, sounds like he is the new Long Distance maniac, did a search for him on the web and found this video. Look forward to seeing more, a nice addition to my MX collection."
5,easy ups for boys 5yrs.and older,I really like pampers easy ups for boys.My grandson has autism and the size 6 is the only pull up that fits him.He uses at least 10 pull ups a day.I have tried other brands and these are the best.With the pampers reward program I also collect points to purchase toys for my grandson.
1,What a let down!,"OK, so I should have read the other reviews before buying this cover. I just got this in the mail and applied it to my iPod. As others have said, it is a poor fit and it is impossible to get the air bubbles out. But my biggest complaint is that it only sticks to the middle of the screen, leaving this limbo area around the screen edges. Also, I paid $14.99 and now I see that it is $2 and something, plus shipping. What a rip-off!"
3,"not really useful, due to not really stick on all area of the ipod video screen.","not really useful, when it cover on top of ipod video screen it not really stick on all area. Due to ipod video screen and it body not really flat each other."
1,hardly lasted a month,Got this hardly a month ago. Sticking the cover on the iPod Video was easy and all seemed fine at first. Then it started peeling. After two weeks the back sticker fell off and now the front is about to follow. Not recommended.
1,Bad accesory for ipod,I pay 15 box for Protective Overlays for iPod Video and 2 weeks before i have to remove for my ipod... is a bad sell
5,Is this really a problem???,"This is a great product! YES, it's true that - if you aren't patient and apply it to the surface slowly working from one end to the other - ""bubbles"" get trapped under the film... isn't that to be expected? So, considering a slow and patient hand even if you do get a bubble or two under the film it's EAAAASSY to pull back off and reapply as it doesn't bond by adhesive but by molecular bonding. Not only that but if you do have a few bubbles you can't even see them when the backlight is active (i.e. watching video). I love this product! I will buy 50 more of them as needed, if needed!"
1,Someone must make a better one.,"Impossible to get even most of the air bubbles out. Poor fit (the back cover only covers about 80%) and getting the front to line up with the click wheel might be posable if the opening was the rite size. Another review said it does a good job of protecting the iPod, but so would duct tape."
1,Good IDEA Bad Product,Okay so I was excited to get these... Thought they would work great protcect my entire ipod from scratches and be an all around good product... Well... Duct tape will protect your ipod also... but i wouldn't use it nor would i use these again...So you clean your ipod great... You go to put on the covers and they are pain to line up and next to impossible to keep all the dust out (a vaccum envrioment like found in labs might work). Then lets get to the click wheel cover... So you put it on... well if you move the click wheel it pulls off... So i am not sure how long it would stay on...As i said before duct tape will protect your ipod too... I would not buy these again.
3,It's ok,It's not fit absolutely with your Ipod Video. But's it ok! You can buy it and should buy a case for your Ipod as well.
3,Overpriced eh?,"These are pretty expensive, I've seen the same single piece of plastic sold for $25!! Unbelievable. But I just found a place that sells 2 for $10... still outrageously expensive I think, but cheaper than a lot of these. Check out ClariVue at the same name with dot com on the end. clarivue.com"
1,Covers for ipods,"Not a very good product. The front cover is not very transparent and clouds the screen. Does not stick well, either. Not very happy with this product."
5,Much easier to put on than I expected,"I suck with screen protectors, I'll admit that. I can't put them on to save my life, and when I do, they're usually all bubbly and bumpy and annoying. This one, however, was very smooth, had good instructions, and I managed to do it with only the most minor bumps (near the wheel, which doesn't matter) and the most minor alignment issues. It's been on since I got it and is still holding up well. Would recommend this to others!"
2,size is not good,"if you would like to buy this stuff to protect your ipod classic 7G? Don't do it. Size is not suited. back side is narrow. the size of front side is not bad, but it is not fit(folds on ipod)."
4,Works Great !,"I wonder if some buyers are getting the right product for their iPod. I ordered the Sreen Overlays for my 5.5G iPod and they fit just fine. Gotta go slow putting on, but they stick great and cover the area I'm trying to protect. I've ordered another set to have as a backup for down the road. Very pleased with this product."
2,Didn't work for me,"I have several iPods that are different models and I have protective plastic skins on all of them without a hitch. I bought this for the 5G. Had the hardest time applying the protective skin. After a bit of getting the skin to stick, the size of the plastic skin did not fit well. I bought this because of the other reviews. They must all work for this company. Anyway, it didn't work for me."
3,good collection; sometimes irritating commentary,"This is a good collection of grandmother/mother/daughter folktales [some well known, and some not-so-well known], but I found reading Yolen and Stemple's [often insipid and flawed] commentary a little tiring. Their dialogues only start to shine when they stop talking about folktales, and start talking about themselves, their daughters, mothers, and grandmothers.Stories are grouped into thirteen ""themes"": Cinderella, Good Girls/Bad Girls, Bad Seeds, Sex and..., Persephone, Really Good Mothers, Hero Mothers, Grandmother, Rapunzel, Caring Daughters, Mothers-in-Law, Snow White, and Mixed Messages."
5,Works perfect for me,"First things first:I allways check the bag each time I use it, for I know not all products are perfect and you need to be carefull. I check if the clamps still click and stay securely in place, I check if I can spot any punctures in the bag.With that said, I have never had a problam with it, if condensation builds in it I use those little anti moisture bags. If used with care you will have the best time taking under water pictures. I don't know if I would take this to the open sea, but for pool or beach it's great.Also I have used it with my PDA and Cell-phone so that I can listen to music, or not miss a call while in the pool or bath, hehe."
5,Hidden knowledge,"As you read the wORds, they begin to permeate and you will realise the greatest trick by religion and dogma that has been played on us regarding the hidden truth in the holy scriptures. This book was recommended to myself (and many others) by one Santos Bonacci, astrotheologist, can I just recommend to anyone (who hasn't already done so) to tune into one of his (Bonacci's) many YouTube videos / radio shows.The truth is out there and very much INSIDE EVERY ONE OF US."
1,Not Windows XP compatible,"Product advertisement states product is usable with Windows 95 and later versions. However, it does not work with Windows XP."
4,"Great shirt, but is it new?","The packaging on this was a clear plastic bag ... not sure if the item is new or not, it didn't have a ""new"" feel or smell, but I wash everything that comes into our house anyway. My 11yr old DS loves it. Quality is acceptable, and sizing seems accurate."
3,Not Healthy,"This product tastes good, is fun, and does work well. However I recently found out that vitamin B12 builds up in your system (the body doesn't release it) and too much can be poisonous. So be careful, this could be a hazard to your health."
2,Could be better!,I wasnt real impressed with the taste of this mix in. It starts out fizzy but that goes away pretty fast. It starts to taste like vitamins more and more. I dont really feel any more energy either. I really dont think it does all it says it does for you. Most likely wont buy again.
4,Great,Gives a pick me up with no jitters. Better than caffeine drinks. I would buy this product again and will.
3,meh,"It doesn't really taste like any berry I've ever encountered. Sort of medicinal, actually. I prefer the grape (ordered this by mistake)."
5,Haven't been sick in TWO years thanks to Zipfizz,"This drink is just wonderful. Although it has caffeine, it doesn't have an alarming amount. The great thing about this drink is all of the vitamins (I'm not good about taking a multivitamin...). I drink this fairly diluted; with at least 32 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces and the flavor is just right. The citrus is my favorite and, sadly, they don't carry that at Costco anymore. I've been drinking only one Zipfizz daily and work in a school -- a huge breeding ground for germs and viruses -- and haven't been sick in the two years I've been drinking this. Pretty impressive. And it is WAY cheaper than a cup of coffee at Starbucks :)"
5,Need my zip fizz,"I've been sipping on this for a couple of years during my workouts, and just love it. It seems to give me a little lift while it's hydrating me. For me citrus is the only flavor I ever want or need."
3,Grape Disappointment,"I don't feel like I represent the general masses, but the grape is definitely NOT the best flavor out there. In fact, I'd say it's maybe 3rd best. The taste was just mundane to me. I like the fact that the other flavors have a little bit of sweet/tart flavor to them so I don't feel like I'm drinking sugar-free Kool-Aid or Crystal Lite. I would suggest that first time drinkers go with the Pink Lemonade, Berry, or Orange Soda."
3,Solidified Vials,I really like this stuff but was a little annoyed that in 2 of my vials the product had solidified. I don't know if water got in there or what but I got less than I paid for. I will still buy Zipfizz I just hope I've seen the last of the solidified product. It was rock solid - there was no getting it out and still using it.
4,"does what it says, decent taste",I drink zip fizz mostly while biking. With all these products the question of taste is critical and personal. The product has a decent artificial grape taste- similar to grape soda. IMPORTANT FACT: It is much better when ice cold. Be sure to mix it with ice or freezing cold water- all zip fizz products taste better cold than at room temperature.
1,repetitive and long-winded,"I wanted a book to use in conjunction with Barbara Ehrenreich to examine modern American society from different viewpoints. I opted for this book, and regretted it. The book contains few new ideas, a much-rehashed thesis, and repetive and circular arguing. The students in my high school, senior level economics class found these flaws without any prompting from me. If repetitive ideas, long-winded prose and turgid structure are you idea of a good read, then this is the book for you."
3,A limited view of 20th Century US society.,"Samuelson, an energetic and erudite writer, has a fascinating thesis: Amercian's standard of living has not declined, our expectations of life are unrealistic. With a gifted, if somewhat imaginative use of statistics, he purports to explain our problem as our misplaced expectations to ""entitlements"". These include a rising standard of living, a prosperous economy, opportunity for all and so forth. We need only realize our limits and everything will be all right. Mr. Samuelson needs to leave his office and conduct his research somewhere beyond the beltway to gain a realistic appreciation of the decline of living standards, and the realities of late 20th Century American society."
4,A good and complicated book,"No question that this book that sums up 10 years worth of articles by one of the most remarkable scholars of his times is a must-read for anybody interested by economics and economic history. That being said the book has its defaults. Some are linked to the difficulty to gather good sources from the medieval Muslim world, but the readers will regret that no statistical approach was attempted even for the European side of the research.Furthermore, the book is particularly poorly written and often enough it seems as if Greif was just making his sentences complicated to make his work sound smarter than it really was. It is unfortunate and many students will hate him for that. Still the conclusions are often brilliant and the book is well worth buying."
4,The Hungarian Vizsla by Gay Gottlieb,"A fantastically informative read, a must for a novice to the breed. Everything from choosing the puppy to training. Great photos and advice"
2,Quest For Camelot Sing-Along,My daughters love the Disney Sing alongs (we own EVERY SINGLE ONE!) and my eldest loves the movie Quest for Camelot - so I thought this was a no brainer...I was wrong. They love the songs from the movie (I think there are 2) and they love the one from the Wizard of Oz - but there is a bunch of Bugs Bunny stuff and other various junk on there that isn't very entertaining at all. Some of the footage is really old with dubbed over songs to try to make it fit the theme of this video. It's collecting dust - not worthy of purchase
1,Terribly bad debut album by former Rose Chronicle's Star,"What a mess. We've waited years in heavy anticipation for the debut solo album from Kristy and what we get is a poorly produced, badly written album. What ever happened to the angst that made the Rose Chronicles so brilliant? The anger and frustration seems all but gone on Souvenir and Kristy's beautifully haunting vocals seem out of place without either the electronic pulsations of Delerium or the hard guitars, piercing our souls of Rose Chronicles. Perhaps recording the entire album in Los Angeles was a mistake. Maybe Kristy needs the Vancouver rain to inspire her?It makes matters even worse that Kristy has little to say on any of the album's tracks."
3,Mistakes,"This is a very complex textbook with TONS of mistakes within. One example that I remember is on page 85, question #66. It says its composition by mass is 49.4% C, 7.64% H, 17.7% N, 15.3% O, and 10.1% S. When working out this equation it will not come out right, it should be 47.2% C, 6.55% H, 13.0% N, 25.9% O and 7.43% C. I hope some of this helps!"
5,super,i am a little OCD with organization and this looks and works great. my plates are almost like they are on display.
5,Just what I wanted to store lids,"Just the right thing to store lids. I recently got new cookware...pretty stainless steel. I want to keep them nice so to organize better I purchased this lid storage unit and it works perfectly for my lids. They are a flat, stainless type lid and they fit well in this holder. Ah, the beauty of being organized!"
2,totally different from picture shown online,"Ordered it and received in two days, but find the rack is totally different from the picture. It is designed for hanging on the wall. There are only 6 slots instead of 8. The base is trapezoid: wider at top, narrower at bottom. How can you advertise one thing and sell another??"
5,The best toothbrush available,I let my dendist be the judge. After useing this toothbrush for about a week I went to a dentist apointment and for the first time ever he told me there was not any plack buildup in my teeth. He asked me what I was doing diferant.
3,POWER BUTTON PUSHES IN,Great toothbrush but the power button was made very poor! It breaks the seal and pushes in over time.Maybe this was done on purpose so you would have to buy a new one?You would think they would use a better method to turn product on and off if they really wanted an effective first class product?Nothing really Elite about this.Go figure.
3,"Great toothbrush, if only it didn't fall apart","I've purchase a number of these beauties over the last several years. They work great. The whole family uses them. But after twelve to eighteen months the green plastic over the on/off switch starts to separate from the body. Eventually, the whole thing gives way leaving a gapping hole. And then, of course, water gets into the unit and soon you get the opportunity to help Philips' bottom line again.It wouldn't be so bad if this part failed when the batteries died. That seems to happen around the three year mark. (My husband was able to get one to last that long through the use of plastic and super glues, but the result was something only an engineer could love.)"
5,clean teeth,"This product is quite easy to use and does the job well. Although it does tickle my lips, it gets the job done quickly. I recommend this toothbrush to anyone and everyone."
2,Major flaw in e9500,"I had an older model Sonicare that lasted years. The newer e9500 seems to last only a few months before the power button seal breaks. This has happened twice. My second unit which was replaced by Philips just developed the same problem as the unit it replaced. Otherwise this would be a very good toothbrush but with this major flaw, I am only giving it two stars. See the photo I uploaded that shows this.Also, on another note... water gets into the brush head. It builds-up ""junk"" after awhile. Not pretty."
3,"Good, bad and not elite","I've used this product for about five weeks and rate it as good, but not ""elite"" as the product name indicates. In fact, I've even considered returning it. While it seems to do an outstanding job of cleaning teeth, the vibration is strong and very disconcerting when the handle or back of the brush hits your teeth. The spray is fine but profuse, so you really need to close your mouth almost completely to prevent the spray from covering everything within a foot or two. Thus, it's difficult to keep the handle or back of the brush from hitting the teeth. I haven't encountered the build-up of fluid and debris in the toothbrush. However, the brush attachment frequently comes loose from the base while brushing the teeth -- which is particularly annoying! I've used an Oral-B for years and am likely to return to their toothbrushes rather than Phillips."
5,Saves my teeth and gums,"Many years ago I bought a Sonicare before it was popular. I am sure I would still be using that original model except that somebody knocked it over and it stopped working. I had it for many years.This is the lazy person's ideal mouthcare device. It does all the work. I always get high praise for my teeth and gum care, but seldom floss--it's all because of the Sonicare. If you want the battery to last forever, do NOT keep the charger plugged in. In fact, keep the toothbrush in the charger (with power unplugged) but do not recharge until the thing stops. If you would rather, you could also wait until it only shows one light, but waiting for it to stop is best."
2,Quality Issues!,"We bought our first Sonicare Elite year before last and have been pleased with the effectiveness it has in keeping our teeth and gums healthy. After a while, the rubberized button over the on/off switch wore away and tore off, leaving a hole to the inside of the unit. Water would get inside the unit and we literally had to stick our finger inside of it to turn it on and off. Well, Phillips has excellent customer service and replaced the unit. However, less than a year later, our replacement unit did the same thing. We give up. We're going to give the Oral-B Triumph a try.Overall: A+ on customer service, A+ on product effectiveness, F on durability and quality."
4,the oral fight,This is my first purchase for an adult electronic toothbrush. With the S.E. 9500 your tongue can feel the post brushing smoothness that an ordinary brush lacks. This is a win-win purchase for teeth longevity.
2,Not for me - causes painful sensitivity,"My wife & I used this product for a little less than a month. After about 7 days, several of my teeth/gums became very sensitive and I stopped using it. About 20 days later, my wife also started noticing increased sensitivity. At that point I returned the brush.I think it's probably an effective brush assuming you don't have any sensitive gums.I spoke to my dentist and she said the problem might have been because I used too much pressure. Regardless I'm happy just using a regular toothbrush and my gums are doing fine :) As I said before; it's just not for me."
2,"A good sonic system, but the brushes are not insanitary","After four months of use, I have to announce my PRO's and CON's of the sonicare elite system:PRO:- Very good sonic power, cleaning your teeth really thouroughly.- Nice design, practical settings (2-minute-clock)- Good and ergonomic shape of the brushesCON:- Insanitary brush heads, which you cannot clean (after three months use,the inaccessible cavity of the large brush was full of fungal dirt,despite my cleaning and drying of the brush after every use)- Therefore, you need to buy a new brush after every some weeks.Considering the very high price of new brushes (20+ USD, which of courseis much too high), this system gets very costly."
1,Don't buy the Sonicare,"I spent a lot of money for this toothbrush (HX9500). Now, after about a year of use, the battery won't hold a charge. You can't replace the battery. If it doesn't work, throw it away. Don't invest in this dud."
5,Daughter delighted with her Sonicare Elite birthday gift,My wife and I have been using the Sonicare system and really believe in their effectiveness. It was a no brainer gift idea when my daughter hinted she would love to get one someday. Her birthday was coming up and I usually like to give gifts that can be used frequently. Pricing on Amazon was great and so was the free shipping. My daughter is estatic with the Sonicare Elite e9500 and is now a believer. Best dental care investment you can make.
2,Buy the Sonicare FlexCare,"Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare FlexCare. The newer FlexCare models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally."
5,"Sonicare Elite 9500? Yes, please...","Gum massage is outstanding. My dental hygienist noticed a difference after 30 days. The 30 second timer keeps you on track, but can also be turned off. With a little practice, you can pucker your mouth just enough that the mirror and sink don't receive a fine spray of toothpaste twice a day. I love it."
2,Good product... flawed design.,"I have used this item since May 2007. Its features are very impressive and I am sure you can read other reviews to find out what is good about it. However, the only comment I want to share is that this item has a poor/ flawed design. I recently realized that there can be water retention in between the holder of the toothbrush and the brush head. This has caused formation of fungal dirt and black spots. Therefore, it needs to be cleaned very often in order for it to be clean. I am very unsatisfied with this item as I feel that I should not be cleaning the inside of the holder. I have decided to purchase an ORAL B toothbrush to replace this product."
3,Sonicare Don't Care,"I judge products by how they perform and how the manufacturer treats the purchaser when things go wrong. Philips don't care about Sonicare.A toothbrush is an item that is used every day so when I vist Europe - my toothbrush come with me.I have used many electronic items in Europe - always of course using a voltage regulator. Philips Sonicare products are damaged. The charger ceased to function - there and back in the USAI contacted Philips and was told to purchase something else.I assume that this is an attitude that their product advisers are taughtGoodbye Philips the ""don't care corporation."
5,Philips Sonicare E9500,"I have used Sonicare toothbrush for more than 2 years with total satisfaction. The E series has desirable features. A slow start to allow acceptance of the sound and vibration lasts two weeks. Thereafter, it delivers full intensity. A timer sounds beep after 30 seconds to encourage treating each of four quadrants of the mouth thoroughly. The effect is amazingly clean teeth. My hygenist reports lower plaque buildup, even after 12 months. This purchase was for the double head model as gifts for my son and daughter-in-law. They like it. And as usual, Amazon came through with timely direct shipping to them. Philips is always first choice and Amazon first source."
2,Power Seal Breaks (see photo above),"Works wonderfully in every way, but there is a major design flaw: The rubber seal over the power button breaks, leading to breakdown and allowing water to enter the unit, where it can't be cleaned and bacteria can grow. Mine lasted about one year. I recommend the unit only if the manufacturer fixes this problem."
4,Great toothbrush,"I really love everything about this toothbrush, except for the fact that the vibrations sometimes irritate and tickle my teeth. Otherwise, I feel my teeth are cleaner, they are slightly whiter (I have only been using it for 2 months), and my gums get adequately massaged as well. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush."
5,Great Product,I would highly recommend this product. My dentist suggested I try this to overcome some periodontal issues and it worked great. My teeth are whiter than before because it removes the yellowing stain and the difference is very noticeable. The brush vibrates very fast and brushes your teeth in a way that you cannot emulate by hand. I have been using this for only a couple of months and it is worth the money. I have not used any other electric tooth brush to compare but I am very pleased with the results from Sonicare.
4,Sonicare Elite,Gives teeth and mouth a fresh clean feeling. Fast vibrating action that gets in between teeth and gums very well.
4,need better acctg.,because of non- delivery the product was returned to amazon with the promise of crediting my account for the returned item. i still have not been credited but my account has been debited again. please correct the problem immediatelyhamid ladjevardi
3,Works - quite pricey,Can't see what justifies the price other than lack of competition - need to get some Chinese manufacturers into this space.
3,Inspiring examples to lift you to success,"I really loved the examples in this book they are very powerful and down to earth. The best example was about how ""your brain is more valuable than any computer could be and they earn millions of dollars for companies and it is impossible not to make that kind of money when you are already worth more than that""!!! This books help you understand that its success is truly not about what & where you are. This books shows you it what you do with what you got."
1,Impossible dreams simple? Dream on .....................,"If this book was true to its title, it would be a permanent world best-seller. At number 65,057 on this site at present, it clearly is not.The author's ""I was a schmuck and I did it, so you can too"" philosophy gets old after a few simplistic chapters.I believe big dreams are possible realities for many people, but the steps are usually complex and unpredictable. The author's personality type may be suited to this stuff, and he's a lucky guy, but his empathy for human variability and limitations is severely lacking."
3,Transcending,"The author relates his journey following the steps of his favorite writer. Throughout the narration, convoluted bits of the present, past events, and thoughts are bound by Leonid's overt devotion for Dostoyevsky, an aging, ambiguous man crushed by his gambling addiction, his love for his young and beautiful wife, his epilepsy, his literary pride and jealousy, and a dearth of writing.Susan Sontag - At the Same Time - introduced this book to me, a sophisticated piece of literature with smooth paragraph-long sentences that led me one page after another to better grasp the complex character of a mythical writer."
3,Confusing at times,"I would not recommend this book for those who have not read Dostoevesky's major works or are not familiar with Dostoevesky's life. There are passages which can get very confusing if you just dive into this novel without prior knowledge of Dostoevesky. To ease matters for readers, Dostoevesky (in his real life) was sent to a Russian labor camp duirng his early years, often have coughing fits, was a compulsive gambler, was often in debts, and relied on his writings to pay off his debts. Tsypkin used this biography of Dostoevesky to craft a fantastical novel that mirrored Dostevesky's real life.The main theme is centered on the relationship between Dostoevesky and his young, always forgiving wife Anna. The strong points in this novel are the scences where Dostoevesky have several of his fits and how Anna stayed patient and forgiving. Tsypkin was very vivid in detailing the ups and downs of their marriage, and some scences could pack an emotional wallop for readers."
1,Time capsule of mostly bad music,"The 1970s was a bad, bad time for a lot of classical music and there's no better proof than this reissued set of recordings by the great guitarist/composer Leo Brouwer. Trouble is that other than Brouwer's mostly tuneless but sort of compelling Espiral Eterna the rest of this album is junk. Steer clear of this if you like Brouwer's material from the 1980s up to now, or if you like Brouwer's work from the 1960s. Most of these works are third-tier knock-offs of stuff Penderecki did much better six to ten years earlier. If you get this CD AT ALL Espiral Eterna is the ONLY reason; even Brouwer's other selection (track 3) isn't all that good. Even great composers can't help making or playing some [bad stuff] and this, from what I've heard so far, is it."
3,The dancing writer,"Roth is best known as the creator of the 5 Rhythms form of movement meditation, but she has supplemented and documented her teaching practice with recordings, videos, and several books. Connections is a short book but a thoughtful one, a series of half-slangy, half-poetic meditations on the concept of intuition, instinct, and inner knowing. Roth writes with the same instinctive flow with which she dances, flinging off memorable phrases like fast moves, touching on a galaxy of other writers and artists, weaving in anecdotes from her own life. This was a pleasurable and stimulating read, if not as good as her earlier book, Sweat Your Prayers."
5,"small, but packs a punch","This book is a loving smack in the face from your street-smart best friend, an eye-opening moment, when you realize that everything you've ever wanted in life has been within reach the whole time. Every sentence you read flip-turns the world upside down over and over again, until all the garbage falls away. It's unbelievably empowering. Roth's writing is rife with plain wisdom, and humor. She's wise beyond our times -- if only we all knew what was best for us, we would try to catch up with her."
3,Truman the chihuahua brings laughter and life back into her home,"This book was a sweet tale about a widow who was helped along her journey of grief by Truman, a chihuahua she purchased on impulse after her husband's death. I enjoyed reading about the joy Truman brought to her life and can relate to that feeling as I'm a widow myself. Some of her descriptions of grief seemed to be an attempt at humor, which fell a bit flat for me, but it could be my own sensitivity in this area. Overall, it was a good book and it reminds me of how much I treasure my little dog who thinks the sun rises and sets on everyone in my family."
4,Skechers good quality,This is a nice pair of shoes for running and jogging cause it's very light and protects the feet.
5,Interesting reading.,"Mrs. Logan, (the wife of General John A. Logan of Illinois, one of the most notable ""political generals"" of the Civil War), was well placed to observe and report on the events of her time.Residing in Washington for more than fifty years, she apparently was acquainted with everyone of importance, and has used her considerable powers of observation and description to produce this highly readable, useful and entertaining chronicle of the public affairs and personages of nineteenth-century America.In conjunction with Mrs, Logan's autobiography the reader may wish to consult ""Black Jack"", James Pickett Jones' excellent biography of General Logan also published by Southern Illinois University Press.(The ""score"" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not 'score"" books.)."
1,poor smell,"My wife loves, loves Design. The compliments she gets when she wears it are remarkable. This bottle purchased through Amazon just didn't smell the same as it does when you buy it from a major department store. DISSAPPOINTED!!!"
5,Happy Wife,Wife has worn this item for many years. This company provides a very good cost and deliverly to the customner. When you can buy two of these items for the cost you would pay at a local store.
2,Didn't care for it :(,"I took a chance and purchased ""Design"" by Paul Sebastian because of the glowing reviews. I was told by someone that it reminded them of an old lady in church. I found it kinda strong, and I agree it has an old fashioned thing going on.I guess thats due to the warm musky notes."
2,Doesn't Last As Long As It Used To,"I've been wearing Design for 20 years. The first time I smelled it, I was at the movies and the woman in front of me smelled so good, I had to ask her at the end of the show what she was wearing. It seems something has changed recently though. It used to last all day, not in an offensive way, but if someone came close to me, they could smell it. I got a lot of compliments on it. The last two times I've purchased it though, it seems to dissipate in less than 30 minutes and after that time, no one can tell I'm wearing any scent at all. This is really disappointing and has me wondering if I need to find a new scent. I bought one of the last two bottles here on Amazon, and the other from another online seller."
5,Design by Paul Sebastian,"My Sister In Law gave me my first bottle Design 8 years ago and I loved it. I have tried other scents, but I keep coming back to Design. No matter where I go, or who I see, someone comments on the wonderful smell. Great perfume!"
3,Not My Favorite,"I love the mens P.S. Its so intoxicating....but this seems to ""flowery"" for me. I'm used to Clean and Fendi brands, which are so opposite.But this is lingering and all I smell is FLOWERS!! It reminds me of an ""oldie""......Lily of the Valley.I'll just give it away. It was a good price, and will cost me more to send back."
1,hulagirl suxs,ordered in stock product on 26th and received notice on the 30th it was out of stock but it still shows on amazon as in stock
2,Didnt recieve a full bottle,"when I recieved the bottle it was about 1 inch less perfume in it from the top. Also this is my favorite perfume but this bottle doesn't quite smell like what it is suppose to. One more thing is the cap doesn't even fit right to the bottle,"
2,"Old, 1970ish Scent",This scent smells like a dated 1970s cheap perfume. I don't even know what to do with it now. I don't see how it could benefit anyone's or anything's olfactory senses. Using it would only be torture to any creature. What does one do with a bad perfume? I'm open for suggestions.
3,design,Not sure it is the original product made by Paul Sebastian. The scent was weak not like the original. I have used Design for over 23 years and this one smelled very weak.
5,So much attention.,"I ordered this because of the reviews and because of all the good reviews i decided to try it. Im a very happy camper. I walk down the street people stop me,my male co-worker says it's his favorite of all the purfum's i wear..."
5,"Fast service,Good price.","I love this parfum spray. I have trouble finding it in stores. It is always sold out. I haveused it for over ten years. It was a good price at amazone and I got it fast. That is why Ishop at amazone, they really get your order to you fast.Thanks, Carol"
4,"Pretty good, pretty dawg gone good!","Any brotha that will stay with a sista when she becomes unable to take care of herself is just heart warming to me. It absolutely stole my heart when Christian (the hero) washed Sean's hair for her (the heroine), but it made me mad when Sean tried to act all uppity with him. I mean, how can you get a brother better than that (which is why I gave the book a 4 instead of a 5)? If Sean doesn't want him, I'll take him!And oh my goodness, I cannot tell you how the terrorist scenes had me steadly turning from page to page. And when you finally find out who the mystery character is, it'll really make you think about our own country's stability in times of terrorist attacks.Extremely moving and intriguing, definitely a most read. The Arabesque people knew what they were doing when they choose this author!"
4,-,"Although at first I had trouble getting through the beginning of the book it appeared to be a quite interesting and fascinating story. By the way, the part about the coup very much reminded me of August 1990... Simona just go on with your great stories!"
3,A Little Out There,"I thought that there were some very good parts in this book, but then there were some that made you wonder exactly what the author was thinking. I mean, religious terrorist that never really had anything to do with the rest of the book, please! It was just a little too unbelievable to make the book come to life."
2,Ehh... it's OK,"Rainbow Rising for a Rainbow fan is not too bad... It offers some insight into the goings on in the band in their heyday, but... and it's a big but... the author doesn't get the real down & dirty info we all desire. He needed to dig deeper into his facts, and he didn't. The book went by too quick. I have to mention that the last 'third' of the book is stats... like gig dates, album info, and musician info. The author even got at least one of those stats wrong... I was at the last U.S. show on their 1981 tour, and he states that that show ""probably didn't happen"". Oh well.... As a fan, it is worth having the book in my library, only because noone else is writing anything about the band... but, don't expect much!"
1,JACK TERRAL,There have only been a couple books which I have not finished reading. This would be one of them... absolutely horrific writing. Poor story line and unbelievably terrible dialog !! Jack Terral could not possibly have any military experience and I'd be even more surprised if he had anything more than a grade school education. He could not have researched the US Navy Seals if this 'book' is any proof of his abilities.
4,Good but not great,"A fast moving book that can be read without a lot of emotion or stress----has an unusal ending, but what else can be expected of fiction?"
5,Mandatory reading,"Best book I ever read, and when my 3 teenagers came of age, it was a book I insisted they read.I particularly recall my eldest son's comment about it being a very funny book, that is until he reached a certain page and then realized it wasn't funny anymore. Back then I even knew the exact page number and even now I recall it was the top of the left hand page. Incredible recounting of who we are, and of how we got here."
4,My Filipina friend agrees - this covers the basics/essentials to Filipino cooking,"I'm building up my cooking collection and saw this video. It's a funky, low-budget production but still covers the basics well enough and was ""approved"" by my Filipina friends :)"
4,american captain,wonderful---I was totally amazed to realize how many white slaves there were throughout the moslem world. But the book is really and intresting one that takes you from sea to desert and back to the sea. It held my intrest for a long time. I have a tendency to skim books but this one held my intrest as I never knew what was going to happen to the captain next
3,It does the job,"It does the job, but I find it to be just a little too large. While lathering up I find myself either hitting my fingers or the handle of this brush on the side of my shaving mug. The bristles, I find, are also too wide. This wouldn't be a problem if i could get the lather all the way to the edge of the bristles, but I can only get it on the center. This means that when I'm applying it to my face, I am tickling my ears with the outside bristles. All that said, it is a great looking brush with a great capacity for creating a quick lather. It also fits well in your hand."
4,a gift for a 5 year old,"The ViewMaster reels were a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter. She loves them. However, the quality isn't as good as in years past. The items arrived just a few days after my order...."
5,For any Cars Lover,Great graphics. Grandson loved it and looks at it all the time. If you like view master than I would recommend the cars reels
3,Kind of a pain,"It is absolutely adorable but somewhat difficult to manage! My husband and I were doing a trial run the night before we were going to go out of town to visit family. It took 30 minutes for two of us to remove from the bag and assemble, it has more components than we expected. It was a bit of a struggle to take down, even the two of us using all of our strength could not get the arms to fold down at first. Once we figured it out (pull up the center handle) things went a little better. I would recommend this product if you plan to put it together and leave it that way. Not ideal for travel if it is just an overnight trip as it is quite bulky, heavy and time consuming to use."
1,Embarrassing,"This is proof that, however beautiful looking and sounding bluray can be, it can not overcome a crappy production.This bluray features horrible staging, infantile costumes, 'community theater' level singing and acting, amateurish direction musical and otherwise,and is overall one of those 'things you can't unsee'.Don't waste your money."
5,I am I am,"I am many times myself. In my life and in my dreams. I lacked direction until I found Mellick's dream book. Here, at last, I found direction, place and space. 'The Art of Dreaming' has helped me negotiate a productive pathway through my dreams and their possible positive applications. As a teacher of 25 years' experience, working with adolescents in a personal exploration context (in the visual arts) i have found ""The Art of Dreaming"" to be a wonderful source of inspiration. Vicki Park"
5,How can you not love Thursday Next?,"Fans of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett in particular will love Jasper Fforde (doesn't that name sound as though it came right our of Hitchhiker's Guide?) and his extremely original heroine, Thursday Next. This is science fiction for the non-scientific fan of classic literature. If you've ever wanted to vacation IN a good book instead of WITH one, you'll enjoy this series. BTW, for hard-core Thursday Next fans who can't wait till 2004 for The Well of Lost Plots, the next book in the series, it's available NOW through Amazon's UK website!"
5,Second in series,"It's late. Your spouse says, ""Turn off the light. It's after midnight."" You mutter, ""One more chapter."" This is that kind of book. And it's LOL good."
3,"Nice effort, not as strong","This book was a nice effort by the writer, but not nearly as strong as the first book. If you're a fan of Thursday Next, this one is not to be missed. If you haven't read any of this series then I recommend reading the Eyre Affair first before deciding on whether or not to read this one."
2,Read Pratchett and Adams instead,"I very much wanted to enjoy this novel, but it just did not live up to my expectations. The heroine's plucky demeanor is mildly entertaining, but most of the plot devices seem to have been culled from two masters of literary sci fi/fantasy: Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. After struggling mightily to finish this book, I yearned for the energy and creativity of Soul Music and Thief of Time."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Eraserhubby.Or, that is what Goliath corp gets their flunkies to do to Thursday Next, being none too pleased with what they have done to her, to start with.Married detectives, generally not so interesting, anyway, so might have been a good thing if they could have kept it that way.Not as good as the first book, as you are used to the mad inventor-book jumping type strangeness that is going to come your way by this point in time."
2,not as good as the first,"fforde's second rendition of thursday next and her booky world isn't as fresh as the first (the eyre affair), seems much more contrived, still very clever and witty and about books so one forgives much. but not too much."
2,I didn't read first one,"Although book begins with some interesting and humorous ideas, it's every chapter is reference to some other novel. I recognized some, but not everyone reads everything that writer did.Frankly, maybe I'd recommend this book to people who read complete British classics and to nobody else."
4,"Time Travel, Book Jumping with Ms. Hathaway, Attempted Murders By Coincidence . . .","The Thursday Next series of books are a blast to read. They have time travel, people jumping into books, characters jumping out of books, murder, eradication by messing with time, and a dodo that can stand on one leg. If you love books, then pick upThe Eyre Affair: A Thursday Next Novel (Thursday Next Novels (Penguin Books)), the first in the series and follow it with this book. They will help you fall in love with the classics all over again, especially Dickens, and give you a new perspective on books.One word of warning: these books take a while to get through, there is a lot happening. If you push through and keep reading, you will love them in the end. Recommended for anyone who likes books and loves to read."
1,horrible,"Horribble customer service. Took them forever to respond to my e-mail, then they claim it was to late and the package shipped!"
2,Lost in a meandering plot,"If you haven't read the previous books, you'll be confused for about the first half. Too many unexplained references to prior plots. The plot is disjointed and wanders from place to place. How any of his books made it to the bestseller list is beyond me. The book isn't funny. It attempts to be clever with obscure literary references and juvenile puns. Although the style seems more aimed at an advanced teen, much of the content would be lost on someone that young. Fforde's works are by no stretch of the imagination any competition at all for the Harry Potter books, as implied by some reviewers. If you're a precocious 12-year-old pre-bibliophile, may be worth a look. Otherwise not."
5,This is part of series -- read the whole series if you love literature.,"The first time I read this series I was blown away by how imaginative Fforde is. He creates a world that is fascinating, hilarious and realistic at the same time. How I wish I lived in the world Thursday Next inhabits and had the ability to jump into books. I won't go into the plot or details (several reviewers have done that already) but I will say that every book in this series is worth reading. I've recommended these books to several of my friends and each one came back to thank me for pointing them towards the series."
5,The World of Fiction,"Jasper Fforde has done it again! LOST IN A GOOD BOOK is Thursday Next's second adventure in the world of books and it's just as much fun as her first, THE EYRE AFFAIR. In this adventure in an alternate version of our universe, Literotecs like Thursday Next wander through the plots of books, protecting them and their characters from nefarious people who try to change plots or do away with characters. While Thursday tries to rescue her ""kidnapped"" husband, she meets characters like Dickens's Miss Havisham and Marianne from SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. This novel's reader, Elizabeth Sastre, does just as fabulous a job as she did with the first novel. Each character has his or her own distinctive voice and accent, and Thursday especially is very appealing. Anyone who loves fiction will love this book! I can't wait for Thursday's next adventure THE WELL OF LOST PLOTS!"
3,Footnotes get a little distracting in Kindle version,"I really enjoy this series (though I'm only through this one the 2nd in the series) and this novel I bought in Kindle version. Warning -- I found the footnotes to be distracting, where you have to navigate to the footnote, click on it, read it and then go ""back"" to the text. Obviously the printed version with the footnote on the same page would be a lot easier to read. That should not detract from the book itself, but with the many clever literary devices that Mr. Fforde uses, I was worried that there were other things I was missing using the Kindle version. The 3 stars really reflects this Kindle issue."
2,Definitely not a good as the 1st in series,"I had heard that this novel was not as good as the Eyre Affair so I was surprised to see it received more stars. Frankly, there was hardly time spent in a ""good book."" What was fun about the Eyre Affair was the interaction with the novel Jane Eyre. I thought this novel was all over the place without a good narrative flow. Furthermore, It was absolutely full of plot holes. If your means of escape is reading yourself into a book, why wouldn't carry book with you? I found myself frequently saying ""Why would you do that?"" Leave the dodo at your mother's and stay in a ""good book"" where the myriad of bad guys can't get you. The Eyre Affair was light but fun. In this novel I got lost in a dumb book."
4,What an imagination!,"These novels are worth the price of admission just to experience Fforde's imaginative powers. Plus, where else can you find such a mixture of whimsy, detective fiction and literary references?"
2,"It can't be that bad if I read the entire book, but","The big but is that I can only give it a two because despite the fact that I really liked the intial premise it's just too over the top for me and I just don't get into this whole mind-worm thing, although I've read plenty of fantasy & sci fi at various times in my life. There is too much all at once with the entering fiction (the part I found promising), vampires, werewolves, odd religions, Chronoguard (actually, if it were just the Chronoguard and the fiction stuff, I would have liked it better) and some of the other things going on, although I do tend to like Stiggins as the series progresses. I read this in hopes that I'd like it better than the first one, so it isn't that Fford can't write that causes me to give this book a two. So, if you like this sort of book, you can take my comments with a grain of salt and buy it anyway--this is mai"
3,Too many loose ends at the conclusion,"I will give nothing away regarding the ending of this book.While I enjoyed the book and found the alternate world Mr. Fforde creates very interesting, I was disappointed by how many plot lines Mr Fforde developed but left unresolved.While definitely interesting, I would only read this book if you are willing to commit to reading the sequel, as it does not stand alone."
3,"Book is great, ebook is poorly put together","First of all, I love, love, love the book. It's witty and entertaining. I already own the whole series in paperback. The ebook version is useless. A major plot device in the book relies on footnotes, and they are non-existent in the book. The little number tags are there, but they don't work as hyperlinks and the actual footnotes aren't even there. Not even at the end of the book where I could look at them manually. I returned my copy because it was unreadable."
5,Best pan I've ever owed,Scanpans are amazing. They do not scratch and nothing sticks. I won't buy any other kind of nonstick skillet. Love this pan.
4,excellent 14 inch fry pan,I need the extra size fry pan frequently as in making several paninnis or other large dish. this heats evenly and maintains non stick quality with reasonable care and clean up. I have had one for three years and this is my second.
4,DVc purchase,Got it on time and as described.I am pleased with it. Just what I wanted.Will buy it again if I need it.
3,NOT AS GOOD DV TAPE AS EXPECTED.,"I KNOW PANASONIC/QUASAR VERY WELL. THEY MAKE FINE PRODUCTS. I HAVE OWNED THE PRODUCTS THEY MAKE SINCE THE 1960'S. I JUST PURCHASED A MINI DV CAMERA FROM PANASONIC. IT CAME WITH A TDK TAPE. TDK, SEEMS TO ME HAS A VERY LONG HISTORY OF GOOD QUALITY VHS BLANK TAPES. I HAVE SOME THAT ARE OVER 10 YEARS OLD AND PLAY FINE. FOR SOME REASON I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT THESE MINI DV CASSETTES FROM PANASONIC. I BOUGHT 5, AND OUT OF THOSE 5, ONE TAPE THAT I RECORDED, WHEN PLAYBACK WAS DONE, NO SOUND ON PLAYBACK. TDK, SEEMS TO RECORD BETTER THEN PANASONIC. I TRIED RECORDING IT OVER AGAIN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. MIGHT BE A FLUKE WITH THE CASSETTE, BUT I WILL TRY SOME OTHER BRAND NEXT TIME. MAYBE TDK, OR SONY. THANK YOU"
3,shipping,"I took advantage of the ""Free"" shipping (6-10 days). What a mistake, It took three weeks to get it. I watched it sit in UPS terminals in 'somewhere' USA and I waited and waited. Free really means much longer than 10 days. I only used Amazon because the free shipping option made the price difference, but I would much rather pay an extra $10 and recieve the goods within the same life time. I won't make that mistake twice."
3,okay for everyday shooting,"I bought this tapes because of the extreme value. I use them in my dvx100b.from my experience they function fine, except the occasional frame drop."
5,So glad I found these for our trip,Our camcorder is 8 years old and we were going on a long European vacation. I was worried I wouldn't find cartridges but they worked great.
5,Perfect,I got this item after a snag with the USPS because they messed up.lol Everything was packed nice and safe. I am looking forward to use these tapes. Thank you :D I'll buy again.
2,Some issues with filmed movies,I have had trouble using these tapes. They do not record so great and I'm wondering if they are old or just not very good quality.
3,Limited dependability,"Sometimes a miniDV cassette tape will ""Drag"" during the first 3 minutes or so of recording.This problem has occurred with different camcorders. It seems to be a Panasonic production problem, andI try to avoid recording anything that is an absolute requirement, immediately after inserting a new miniDV tape.Calls to Panasonic have not helped so far."
2,Beware of dropouts when using in XH-A1 camera,These tapes used to work OK for me.Not now. Almost every one of them I used this summer had one or more timecode breaks / dropouts when using in my Canon XH-A1 camera. (All the tapes were brand-new and not being re-used.)I film lots of live events and can't have even one frame missing from my footage! I'll be switching to a higher-end tape today.
4,Count on the Magic Numbers,"Had only heard one song from this group ( off the Catch and Release movie soundtrack) and decided to take a gamble on a whole album. Not at all disappointed! Fun stuff! This was an early album of theirs, I will look for more."
3,Pretty Good,How do you conjure up 60's sunshine while still being contemporary enough to crack the current market? They do as good job as can be done with that impossible task. Some of the slower songs a grating.
2,Not enough magical numbers,"2 1/2Stodart is the charismatic indie pop-blues-rock embellisher who can make average seem adept, but this debut is too lengthily derivative for those emulations to really shine through."
2,A few good ones,"This album is sort of a typical album in the sense that there are a few gems surrounded by filler waste tracks. The good ones are great though, but so far I've only 5-starred one (Love's a game) on my ipod.Don't listen to all those who say The Magic Numbers have a sound from an older time. I never got that impression. It's just good music."
3,"Fun and pleasant, but not groundbreaking","I first heard the Magic Numbers on the Help: A Day In The Life CD. I really love the track ""Gone are the Days"". Unfortunately this CD is not quite up to the quality of that song. It's good, fun music. But it just doesn't quite sizzle enough for me to recommend it to all of my friends. This is the sort of CD that adds a bit of depth to a playlist on an mp3 player, but not one where I picture myself putting in the CD time after time to listen to on its own."
1,B-O-R-ING,"I listened to this CD with my Dad. And you now what? IT'S COMPLETELY BORING. Every track seems to sound the same and drone on and on and on. Where's the excitement? Where's the fun? There doesn't seem to be any. We nearly fell asleep listening to this CD. It's like a bad fusion of country and pop music. If you're looking for some good music, AVOID THIS CD."
4,Magic Music,"Wow! It's so refreshing to hear this kind of music. It's thoughtful, musically interesting, and playful. There is a throwback kind of sound they have, like the music was hand-made if that makes sense. They play classic rock instruments and what sounds like little or no synthesizers. I got teh feeling I was listening to a band (a very good band) in their garage jamming for the pure joy it gives them. These are songs that mean something to them. They probably wrote them all themselves.The only downside to the album is that all the joy and frivolity gets mired in a few too many morose songs in the second half.If you're looking for something different from most everything else out there right now, you probably can do no better than The Magic Numbers."
5,A pleasant surprise long in coming!,"Wow! I've been waiting years for a CD as great as this one from a band as great as this one! Everything works on this album...EVERYTHING! I can't stop listening to it and The Magic Numbers have finally eased the depression that had overtaken me earlier in 2005 when Luna decided to call it quits. THANK YOU! AWESOME ALBUM! (who would have thunk that I would be raving about this album....I heard about them from a video playing in the juniors section at Nordstrom's, HILARIOUS!)"
4,Good lecture material for work...,I bought this book with the idea to put together a lecture...and it worked perfectly. Nice way of putting the thoughts and easy to use with those in Chemical Dependency Treatment - many have been in several treatments and I am always looking for something new - updated - and a bit of a different take from the ordinary.
5,This is a tragic shame!!!!!,"This is a tragic shame that no one knows about Vanessa the way we know about so many average gospel artists. The fact that I am the first one writing a comment on this project proves my point. Vanessa Bell Armstrong can make shivers go up and down your spine everytime she opens her mouth. This woman's voice is so annointed and spirit-filled. I remember bopping to Vanessa's rendition of "" Walk With Me"" when I was six years old. Now that I am a woman, I have never forgotten her. I always believed that Vanessa deserves more recognition for her unbelievable talent. She is a Grammy-deserving wonder!!!! Some of my personal favorites are "" Peace Be Still"","" Nobody But Jesus"", and ""Walk With Me""."
5,I was her Neighbor,I lived next door to Sophie and I was excited to hear about the book. I couldn't wait to read it. I found it very interesting and couldn't put it down. Even though I knew most of the story about the divorce the times during the war captivated me. Sophie is a true hero.
1,Please read this,"I read this book and I didnt like it. It was too sad. My teacher said it was written bad.My daughter had to read a book for history for her fifth grade class, so she chose this one. After it came and she read it, I read the book also. I feel I should have researched the book better and I went to the author website, which was rather confusing. The book appeared to be written by and for children but the material content is definitely for adults. The material is okay, but there are a few cursing words. This is not a children's book. My suggestion would be to go to the authors website and read some of it before you buy it. [...]"
1,This is not a durable detector,"I own two of these and after a couple of years or when the battery is dead, it does not accept the new battery and will not stop beeping. This is really a throw away detector and I would suspect not very reliable as a carbon monoxide detector. DO NOT BUY THIS DETECTOR, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!"
4,Love between Orca and Osprey,"It is my view that folktales - tales of such quality that people kept the story alive for centuries - are excellent literature for people of any age. Anne Cameron aims her retellings of Northwest Native tales at a young audience but all of us can enjoy all of them.This particular story is poignant - the story of love between an Orca and an Osprey. The tale ""explains"" the black and white of the Orca, the leaps out of water, and the beautiful songs as the results of this love. Like all Anne Cameron's retelling, this tale is well worth sharing."
5,Great Soap!,"I bought this soap at first because of the name. But when it arrived and I used it, I was very pleasantly surprised at the soap's scent and how it lathered when showering. I am not sure why it is called an athletic soap, but it has a nice aroma and keeps with the British tradition of quality bathing soaps."
3,The Foale Family's legacy...,"This book provides the reader on a short excerpt on the history of Foale's family experience on Michael's launch into the outer space which gave Britain much of credit in the advancement and contribution to astrophysics (Britain has long lost its global prominence since Queen Victoria deceased in 1901).We've learned through this book that Michael lost his brother, Christopher, in a tragic car-crash along the coast of Dinaric Alps on a twisty turn somewhere in Montenegro. After this loss, Michael has gained unexpected amount of maturity and determination which made him strive to achieve into a state of unbelievability.15 years after Michael's successful mission the Mir, his son and daughter, Ian and Jenna, have matured into young adults. So, the question remains, will his offsprings continue to elongate Michael's hard-earned leagacy, or will their talents be completely tainted by the sick world that we live in today? Only through observation, we shall know the truth."
3,Visually Grabbing and a Simple Read of the State of Film Today,"I purchased this book used, in great condition. It's really a coffee table book that upon viewing is prone for a conversation starter of what is and what is to be soon. The photos and illustrations within are well worth the price. I have skimmed through this book several times now, seeing something new each time."
4,This book is one of the greatest history's of our world.,"Being the first book I have read by Fernandez-Armestro I cannot comment on it in relation to previous works, however, suffice to say that I was impressed not only by the literarily worthiness and depth of research but also by the courage to take on a topic of such obscurity. This `guide for the perplexed' is possibly one of the most probing books written this decade, no other book searches with such depth for truth itself. I thoroughly recommend this book to anybody with an interest in history, philosophy or ideology."
5,Works,Works as advertised. Be nice to have multiple inputs. Slightly pricy but it appears durable enough to last a few years.
2,Cant turn on/off when you want,"It will only turn on 2,4,6,or 8 hours after dusk. No way to adjust to for pre-dawn. I'm not using anymore."
5,Outdoor Light Sensor Extention Cord,I have been using this for over 5 years and it has worked perfectly turning on/off a spot light at Christmas. The sensor works very well so it turns on at dusk and I have it set to turn off 2 or 4 hours later. It has withstood the New England winters well. Now I have the spot light set up near the entrance of the driveway to add light as it is getting dark early. My wife is happy to get the extra light when turning into our driveway from the road.
2,NOT AS PICTURED- BEWARE!,The item received is NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS PICTURED! Ordered the Coleman (4 of them!) and got Woods brand which features a protective ridge where the plug would go and 3-plug adaptors cannot be used. Returning these as I own the one pictured and this is not it. 5-stars for the Coleman one pictured and 2-star for the Woods model received because of the ridge.
1,Faulty From Day 1!,"Maybe I just got a 'bad one', but this timer has been faulty since Day 1. I need it on the 8 hour setting, and noticed right away that it cuts power after some variable amount of time (substantially less than 8 hours, I know in one case I observed the lights out after only 4 hours!). I have many of these timers, mostly Intermatic, and they work great for years before any type of failure. I won't buy another Woods. :(PS: I was on vacation and didn't have time to deal with this nuisance and my product return window expired so I'm stuck with this piece of junk, which will go straight into the trash as soon as I get an Intermatic to replace it. Fortunately, it wasn't a super-expensive item."
3,for the money it is ok,I bought six of these for me town pole lights and one died on me withing 2 weeks of use. I know this can happen and I threw it away instead of paying the postage to return it. It would have ended up costing me too much.
5,Great outdoor light timer,"I have used this light time for several years outside for Christmas lights and it has been very consistent. Like the settings for all night, 2,4,6,8 hours after dusk. Needed another timer for the back of the house and didn't hesitate replacing it with this one"
4,Great,Works exactly as advertised and holds up very well outdoors. Have one three years old outdoors like new. Great value.
3,Basic and good,Used it for holiday outside lighting... Works fine. IR plus time (you choose) for off time. Of course... made in China.
2,One good mix,"...is all you get on this single. The ""Menace"" mix, as mentioned in the previous review, adds more depth to the original, but clocks in at a mere 4 minutes and 23 seconds. The Chris Lake mix is basically a dub, offering few vocals and a thematic thread that bears no resemblance to the original. I usually like Williams's remixes, but this package is a dud. Note to remixers: Please maintain the integrity of the original song while building around it. If I wanted to hear techno bleeps and burps, I'd actively pursue them."
5,Kris Menace Remix,"The Kris Menace Vocal Re-Interpretation Mix is the best mix on the cd--hands down. It keeps many of the original elements of the song, but adds more to the beat. This enhances the synths in the original. The Chris Lake remix is horrible. It is boring and repetitive. Download the Menace Remix. The Dub is very good as well."
2,One series out of three were good.,"One series out of three were good. Mr. P. was excellent as always, all were episodes I'd never seen, but Miss Marple was really slow, & the S. Holmes were just pathetic. Horrid rendition of Holmes with the most dreadful acting, had to stop it 10 minutes into it because it was just so boring. I would not recommend this at all, just buy Mr. P & get what you want...quality acting & directing."
4,Frank and very informative account,This author presents the facts about accidents and causes and links that to the stage of experience of pilots making the strong case that most accidents occur between 50 hours and 250 hours when pilots are on their own and very inexperienced. The low accident rates below 50 hours are explained because more than likely we have been with our instructors and skill levels would be high through practice and of course the instructors are right there to correct mistakes. All new pilots should read this analysis. Good book!
4,Excellent Overview of What Kills Pilots,"I found it to be a well written and accurate account of a real problem: the rate of GA pilots who die, especially between 30-500 hours of PIC has not declined in spite of all kinds of improvements in avionics, near real time weather availability, etc. Given that an acute pilot shortage is expected to due to many fewer people learning to fly, I'd say this is also an important subject in terms of the economic effect."
4,"All pilots, but especially new ones, should read this.",Here's a book providing the data (and analysis thereof) showing how and why pilots get into serious trouble. New pilots would be well advised to read this book to instill the necessary sobriety achieved from experience.
3,"Okay, but things you should already know as a pilot","Not enough unique content in this book. There are better books (Stick and Rudder), and plenty of websites (for example: AOPA & FAA Accident Database) that have similar information for low time pilots. I recommend checking this book out from your local library to browse through but not necessarily to own."
3,Not bad but not great,"There is some interesting information in here, but the book could have been half as long. Much of the book repeats basics that we all know from our student pilot training (or at least should know). The crash reports and summaries are a good reminder of some basic pilot errors that cause accidents, but I was hoping for more practical advice on risk management."
1,LIsten to the samples first,"I am writing this completely on the sample track evidence. These are not the movie/tv themes you love. All the tracks I listened to here were redone in midi style, like you would find in a late 80's, early 90's video game. While this is okay for themes that already used MIDI processing, like The X-files, hearing The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mission Impossible, and Psycho like this is enough to make you want to stab yourself in the ears to stop the pain. While the songs they picked for this compilation are great in and of themselves, I wish that instead of claiming an orchestra recorded them, they actually got a real orchestra to record it. Was the Budapest Symphony Orchestra too busy to do this, or did someone not know real quality from MIDI crap."
5,Excellent Collection for Upper-Intermediate Japanese Student,"I have only made my way through the first three of the essays in this volume but must say that I am highly delighted. Ashby does a fine job of annotation here, and although this volume lacks parallel text translation, it more than compensates for this through superb explanation of the syntactical forms encountered.The selections seem well-chosen and relevant to modern Japan, and indeed a tremendous satisfaction is afforded to even an intermediate student like myself by reading these texts in the original.Five Stars without reservation!"
4,Great but to much advertising and extra stuff on disk,"The movies are wonderful, clear as a bell and great fun to watch with the whole family BUT there is much to much extra stuff on the disks, advertising and talking, it is like when do we get to the films !!!"
1,Disapointment and Failure,"This DVD played ""The Return of Dick Tracy""; after that it would do nothing but repeat little segments that had appeared prior to the movie. I have given up on it and will not order anything similar. This is the first failure of anything ordered through Amazon."
2,DON'T KNOW,I can't review this item because BrandsOnSale sent me the BOY'S teen mummy costume instead!!!!!
5,Ford Forward,"For what it is, minimal techno, it is flawless. If your planning to 'throw your hands in the air, and wave 'em like you just don't care' you will be sorely dissapointed. Hypnotic, tight beats with a dash of the deeper pads that made Fordtrax one of the best acid house releases of all time."
3,A rogues' gallery,"This is a compendium of Nazis (`Hitler;' `Practitioners' -Göring, Goebbels, Heydrich, Himmler, Bormann, Röhm; `Functionaries' -von Papen, Rosenburg, Ribbentrop, Hess, Speer, Frank, von Shirach, General, Professor, Wife, Höß) published in 1970. It's well worth reading, but not up to the author's subsequent excellent work (`Hitler' 1973, `Speer' 2001).Most problematic in literary terms is discontinuous menagerie of disjointed, vain, and often incompetent rivals. It's not an easy read. On reflection, that's accurately indicative of the compartmentalized ruthless jealousy under the führerprizip. Readers seeking cohesiveness between principal figures beware: there was little or none.Taken individually, this is an interesting and enlightening analysis of villains (a dictionary of blackguards). Nothing more.Also recommended:GM Gilbert's `Nüremberg Diary'JK Galbraith's `Name-Dropping'"
2,Marred by errors and too dry,"This book was poorly translated and even in the original German, Fest is a heavy writer, turgid and hardly scintillating. This compilation is laden with errors, some major, some not, but the ultimate effect compromises the integrity of this book. It's absurd, for example, to make the statement that Hermann Goering's Nuremberg defense was anything but brilliant. One can loathe what Goering stood for and decry Nazism and its atrocities, but to deny that Goering stole the show at Nuremberg is historically inaccurate.There are many better summations of the Nazi leadership than here. This is as dry as timber and about as edifying."
2,"worth reading, but short on objectivity","Oversimplified and relentlessly negative. Filled with sweeping negative generalizations that ignore abundant evidence of positive characteristics of the Third Reich personalities. The caricatures painted of the key figures in the Third Reich are laughably unrealistic. As a serious history reference, this is a terrible book. It is so bad that it's actually worth reading: its sheer awfulness makes it a great example of how NOT to write a serious non-fiction book."
5,Great Book!!!,"You don't have to like The Jets to love this book. It's straight forward, easy to read and very interesting. All my friends are reading it."
3,Men's Maui Sandal size 8 is more like a woman's 8,"Be aware when you order this sandal that it runs REALLY small. I wear a men's 8 and I bought them for my husband who also wears an 8. When I got the sandal, it was more like a woman's size 8 than a man's! Really small....have to exchange it. Otherwise, the sandal seems really nice."
1,"Poor quality, uncomfortable inflexible PVC piece of cr*p","I ordered these from another vendor. The moment I opened the box and put them on, it was a huge shock for me. Theglowing reviews on these made me buy them but I was never this disappointed with any purchase in my life.Let me explain -The sandals look about ten times better in the picture than in real lifeThey look and feel real cheap and are extremely uncomfortable. Sandals made of PVC? PVC is supposed to be for tubing, not sandals. It makes the sandal rigid and inflexible. Flexibility is necessary for comfort. Also, these run about 2 sizes short. I ordered a 11.5 even though I was a 11 and it felt like it was a 10 and real tight. I imagine that even if the size was right, it would still be very uncomfortable. These are cheap, chinese made junk that are best rejected at the port of entry. Dont be seduced by the photograph showing all those nice looking water holes, it is a piece of cr*p these sandals"
2,No case. No warranty. Too clear lens,"I previously bought this model from another seller in black colour. It arrived in a hard plastic case, instructions and warranty. I wanted a colour change and ordered them in brown. The lens are too clear so they don't do their job of really protecting from sunglare. On the other hand, they came in a cheap cloth case without model details, nor warranty."
2,Wrong Color,"I was disappointed when I saw the yellow and red dice, there were suppose to be black and red. When you're a fan like I am, color makes a difference. I will keep them cause its not worth the time to return"
2,Fine Print,When receiving this item it was fuzzy dice however it was not in the same color that was advertised. Was not as impressed as I thought I would be.
2,"I like the dice but the color of the black dice came in gold , not like what's in the pic red and black..","So I got this like a week ago and it's koo but not the same color as shown in the picture on amazon , can we exchange?"
5,Represent the 49ers!,Saw this at the county fair this summer for $12 and I knew I could find a better deal on Amazon. Not as boxy as the photo shows but more rounded. Fantastic way to show my team pride during my daily commute and when driving around town. Go niners!
4,"Excellent, BUT","This book taught me Latin effortlessly, BUT I wouldn't recommend using it without a qualified teacher. There're too many places where the book is spotty in its coverage (mostly at the beginning). (It doesn't start out with numbers, colors, or days of the week. In fact, I'm not sure it ever mentions colors or days of the week.)"
2,Interesting but biased...,"One can't deny John Hammond's contribution to Jazz. The man ""discovered"" Billie Holiday, Teddy Wilson, Count Basie and produced tons of records. On the other hand, he had a ""bon savage"" view of the Jazz musician that was far from reality. When Ellington began composing his ""mood pieces"", Hammond, until that time a Duke champion, became an enemy. His attitudes were both paternalist and naive. And this book reflects this behavior."
5,An excellent survey indeed.,This first volume of the AH! My Goddess second season is a recommended pick for any library serious about anime and manga representations. It provides American audiences with the second season of the animated TV series and any library dedicated to representations of such will find this an excellent survey indeed.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch
3,Heavy Duty,"I used these pockets for my 12 year old son to keep his bookbag organized. He puts different subjects of homework in them, color codes them for different subjects."
3,Great Easier Piano Literature,A fine collection of music and indeed there is something for everyone. However don't be fooled by the fine print! I must say that i have been a piano student of 14 years so I have a feel for the different levels of piano. I do NOT consider the literature in this book to range from easy to intermediate levels. I would recomend this book for students beginning perhaps at the intermediate level. This book does not consist of easy litature and i would no recomend this for beginning students. A close friend of mine uses this book and she is an intermediate level player.
4,"Bought it yesterday, finished it this morning.","""Secret"" is told in the first person by a young girl, 7 years old when we meet her and 14 at the end of the book. Initially her concerns are fairly typical for a bright third grader, and it is surprising how quickly we are drawn into her little world and learn to care whether she retrieves her shoes from her friend, etc. When the story begins to darken, the reader is hooked.In spite of the evil of her surroundings, Secret prevails through her innate goodness and strength, and her unshakeable faith in Jesus. This is an essentially hopeful story, with well drawn characters and a finely woven plot. A ""prequel"" is in the works, and hopefully many more stories from this very promising young author."
4,A great 'warts and all' reference,"So... you know you love reading, you want a good excuse to get together with others who love to read and you think you'll start a book club. Great - read this book! Not only does Jacobsohn cover what you'd expect (like providing a multitude of suggested reading lists) but she covers the issues you may not think of immediately - like acknowledging that people are likely to relate their reading to personal experiences in their lives and making sure that everyone in your reading group understands the importance of keeping confidences. My only criticism - not much attention paid to the growing phenomenon of online book clubs."
4,an sightful guide for starting a reading group,Jacobsohn has written a wonderful guide for anyone interested in starting a reading group. Jacobsohn seems to have thought of everything one would need to prepare and think about before beginning a group. She gives helpful check off lists to keep the mechanics of the group running. This book appealed to me because of the easy to read style in which it was written and the many comments from members of the several reading book clubs that Jacobsohn has been involved with. I especially liked the recipes she includes.
4,Oh Yeah!,Nice soap but it gets used up kind of quickly. Both my wife and I liked this soap alot and it's got a great smell. Lasts only about 2/3 as long as a 'regular' bar.
2,Eh.,"The soap smells nothing like actual banana (real or artificial), and was a little drying. But whatever scent it is is pleasant enough."
3,Soap,"I hate to crush reviews, but I didn't see the point to this soap. I thought that it was supposed to smell like banana. I don't smell anything at all. Kind of disappointed. It is probably a 1/3 less than regular soap, so it isn't going to last long. I don't think that it is worth the money, and I hope if you buy this you have tried it in person first. Not going to suggest to friends or family."
4,Now That I Am An Older Woman,The poem itself has been around for many years. Bought 3 copies of the book for 2 sisters and a friend - it has really good illustrations to go with the text. Everyone approaching 50 needs this!
4,When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple,"This was the perfect gift for my wife, and old woman who loves the color purple!"
1,When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple,"Unfortunately, although I have seen this book before and had high expectations..it was cut totally crooked all the way thru so looked very cheap and I could not use for the gift intended."
3,Nice kitchen towel - unless you want to hang it,"I bought this towel to replace some our cotton towels in the kitchen. Overall the quality is good but not the best towel we've found since. My biggest improvement would be to include a loop for hanging, like most professional kitchen towels. I also do prefer the hand-feel of cotton or cotton-blend towels."
4,Very nice drying towel,"These are very nice. I purchased the white towels and they absorb water really well. They are a nice size and they keep their size when washed (no shrinking). The only down side is that they will stain fairly easily so mine are starting to get slightly discolored. If you have kids who have a tendency to grab a drying towel to wipe off hands that are still sticky, I would suggest keeping a regular terry cloth in their vicinity so this towel doesn't get too stained. The price was great when I made my purchase and the 4 for 3 incentive made if worthwhile to purchase several sets.I would buy these again and I would recommend the dishcloths that are made of the same material."
3,"Great for housekeeping, so-so in the kitchen","I love the texture on these and they are great for wiping down counters and scrubbing the sink. They catch crumbs, rinse and dry easily and don't smell much. These do have durability issues, however. They wore out very quickly and ended up being household rags instead of kitchen cloths. They stain easily and the edges unravel."
3,"good quality, terrible feel",This is good quality. I can't stand the feel of these. I have dry hands and its yuck! I don't believe most people will find this so though. And these are some of the best quality out there.
4,Madhouse,"I was the Location Manager for this movie and it was not only funny but fun making the picture. Most of it was filmed in Tucson, Arizona but we shot 3 days in LA also. John and Kirsti were absolutely great together. It's one I can watch over and over. I hope it comes out on DVD sometime soon.Jack Young"
4,Madhouse,I think this is a really funny comedy! And I think it should be put on DVD. Kirtie Alley is great in this movie as she always is.
4,The Obnoxious House Guests Who Wouldn't Leave (The Title Of My Review Sound Like The Title For A Horror Movie),I like John Laroquette and Kirstie Alley and I truly enjoyed watching this funny movie called Madhouse which is about obnoxious houseguests. The situations in this movie with the obnoxious houseguests may be exaggerated but haven't you ever had a houseguest who was really annoying and you couldn't wait til they left? I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had obnoxious houseguests and I would like to see this movie put out on DVD. (Widescreen!)
4,"If it's odd at first, give it a little time...","Upon first listen, I was thinking, ""Man, they should've just changed the name of the band."" However, I've been listening to it more and more over the last few days, and, at this point, I have to say this is truly one of Candlemass' great albums.Lowe's vocals are just about perfect for these songs. He lends a diversity to the group that makes this album shine (darkly). From track to track, I really feel that his chameleon-like singing is what puts this one over the top.Even if you're not a fan of their earlier recordings, this one would be an excellent place to start. It makes me happy to hear creating something so fresh in 2007 that stands right alongside albums like Nightfall and Epicus. It's a great, heavy, memorable, dark Candlemass album--full of twists and turns through beautifully gloomy territory. What more could you ask for?"
3,"Once again, the post Messiah era....","Well, it worked the first time with Thomas Vikstrom. Chapter 6 is a great album. Clearly they just cant make things work with Messiah Marcolin, they've been there and done that. A shame, because the sound and material of the main line up was so intense. Robert Lowe (Solitude Aeturnus) steps in here, and the first impression anyway is solid enough. The band is clearly in a better place, as the next release is already on the way. Like anything, it'll take some getting used to, but its not a bad cd. The Gloom and Doom rolls on."
5,Point Blank,"I rated the book five stars becaese it is a very fast moving action packed book. It is about a teenage spy named Alex Rider who works for a spy company called MI6. Currently, this is the second book in a series of four. You would need to read the first book to be able to understand this one. Alex is sent to a finishing scholl called Point Blanc to investigate a crime. A man named Dr. Grief is up to something evil and Alex is going to fight his way through the whole book. Read it to find out what happens."
3,"Point Blank I read the book called, Point Blank by Anthony H","I read the book called, Point Blank by Anthony Horowitz. The book was very interesting because Alex rider goes on a lot of action packed adventures. This is because he is a talented young spy. Personally, my favorite part is when Alex was chasing a man in a boat up a ladder. The man closes the latch at the top of the ladder behind him and locks it. Alex used one of his neat gadgets called, ""Zit Cleaner"" but what it actually does is eats through any type of material. I liked the book but it was a little confusing. I recommend it to people who like spy books and I rate it three stars."
4,Point Blanc,"The main characters in this story are Alex Rider, 14, Dr. Greif, Mrs. Stellenbosh, and the MI6 president. Alex Rider is a kid who works for the MI6. Two major corporation owners have been murdered recently. The MI6 is suspicious about the Point Blanc school because just before the two corporation owners had been murdered, they had sent their kids that have been banned from other schools go. Point Blanc is up in the mountains. The MI6 decides they are going to send Alex Rider to fond some clues.Many surprises happen in this story. Dr. Greif is the president of Point Blanc. Mrs. Stellenbosh is the assistant. Most of this story takes place in Point Blanc.I liked this book because it was exiting and unpredictable. It starts out slow paced, but gets faster. I would recommend this book to mostly boys in middle school and up. Some girls might like it if they like adventure books. This is the author's 2nd book in a four book series."
4,action packed!!!! loved it,this book was super good! its well written and the end makes you want to read more. its acton packed. what dr. grift does is sick but this book is really good! alex is awesome and saves the day but theres a twist in the end. i couldnt believed it end the way it did. but it did i love this series! read it read it!!!
5,A great book for anyone between 8 and 18,"In my opinion, the author of Point Blank, Anthony Horowitz, has pros and cons to his writing. Starting with cons, I think that in this book, Anthony Horowitz refers back to the previous book in the Alex Rider series, Stormbreaker, a lot. I have read Stormbreaker, but I think that some people may not understand the book as well because sometimes there is not enough description to the characters that were in the previous book. I think that Anthony Horowitz forgets that some people may only read Point Blank and not Stormbreaker. He may not add enough detail to the characters that were in Stormbreaker and still play a part in this book. My pros for this book are just as important. One of the many skills Anthony Horowitz has is when to build up the suspense. I am always tempted to read on."
4,"alysa thinks this book ROCKS!(tokyo,japan)",yeah. this one is as good as stormbreaker.....granted some parts were pretty predictable. but it was none stop action from the very beginning. fyi: i think mr. blunt is a selfish person from the very beginning when he blackmailed alex in stormbreaker.
5,Point Blank,"This is a really gripping book. It keeps you wanting to turn the next page all the way through. Its witty, even though the cover reads to be a bit unrealistic, it unfoldes into a large web of lies and evil as a insane South African's dream to take over the world and change it into a racist one becomes a reality. The 14 year old MI6 agent Alex goes undercover as a rich mans rebel son, who is sent to Point Blanc Academy, with a group of drug dealers and fire starters. With no gun he is sent to a heavily guarded school run buy a South African bio chemist, and the 7 boys there are watched buy 30 armed guards. The Lower, 2nd and 3rd floors are out of bounds, and there seems to be no way up to invesigate. With only his SAS survival training, will Alex manage to dig up info on the evil headmaster. Will this be Alex's last mission?"
4,"Frightening, well-written, very readable","Anthony Horowitz is a well-renowned TV screenplay producer who adapts ""Poirot"" amongst other things. The Alex Rider series feature a 14-year old spy who was sucked into working for MI6 when his uncle was murdered. This book is even better than the first (Stormbreaker) with a truly terrifying villain and action all the way through. Watch out - maybe a little too intense for a nine year old. Strongly recommended."
5,Point Blank,"My friends both recommended this, and it was a great book. There's a lot of suspense. The villian is great, it's so much better than Stormbreaker.It's about a 14-year-old boy who works for M16, which is like the CIA but it's in England. Alex Rider's uncle, Ian Rider, had died on his mission and they want Alex to work for M16. There's more like that in Stormbreakere goes on a mission to the boarding school because of somewhat of a coincedence that M16 wants to investigate.I totally recommend this book to anyone, unless you get scared at movies like Lord of the Rings."
1,a waste of 2 hours,"A most horrid story and writing too. This book is about a supposed MI6 teen spy and is the most dreadful thing I have ever read. The only upside was that it is so short it can be knocked out in about 2 hours.I have no idea how I even ended up with this book. It is so preposterous in it's story line, it is just absurd. I can't imagine who is rating tis thing highly. Good Lord, if this is all it takes to have a career writing, I need to switch gears now."
2,Alone,This story is called Point Blank is a sci-fi story. It is about a young boy named Alex living without any parents or any guardians. Also he is owned by the government and being used as a spy. He is assigned a mission to go to a school and see what they do. He finds out that they are making illegal clones. This book was okay but it left you hanging and had some parts that were un-needed. Though it did have some very exciting parts that blow you away. I think you should not read this book because it leaves you hanging in the end.The End
1,Not very exciting,I didn't like this book very much. It was not beliaevable and stupid in some places. My dad bought it for me but I told him not to buy any more for me. Harry Potter is better.
4,claras revew,i think that this is a wonderful book and if you like sort of mysterious books rban this is the perfect book for you.
5,A great read for mystery and adventure fans,I loved this book. It was very detailed and descriptive from start to finish. It always made me wonder what is going to happen next.
5,why you should read alex rider,i think this is a great and fun book because it is enjoying at the right price and a lot of action thats why i totally recomend this book
3,"Exciting Story, Sorry Ending","Point Blank was great, up to the last chapter. If you like the 007, James Bond type stories, this is it. It it a take leave of reality and enjoy the impossible type book. Mr. Horowitz' first book, Stormbreaker, was great. I thought this would be good too and it was, until the very end. It is obvious that Mr. Horowitz wrote the last chapter with a sequel in mind. I do not like to be left hanging, Mr. Horowitz! Also, I didn't like the fact that all the adults, the ""good"" and the bad, were untrustworthy. Read the book, beware the last chapter."
5,point blank,The book Point Blank is an action book. In the begining he goes on a mission to track down some drug dealers by himself. He gets caught and gets put in jail but then m16 comes and puts him in a mission. m16 is a goverment agency kind of like the cia. He gets sent to a bad rich kid school in the french alps to see if anything strange is going on and to see if the place has anything to do with the death of two people. When he gets there there is a kid that is different from anyone else there. The kid thinks that something is going to happen to him so he wants to run away. But before he gets a chance to run away something does happen to him and he turns all weird. the rest of the book is about his adventure. You will like this book if u like mysteries and action books. I thought the book was great.
5,An awesome Spy Adventure,The 2nd book in the alex rider series is awesome. the descriptions of characters and gadgets seem to make this book play like a movie in your mind. In this book alex rider must pose as the son of a wealthy food store chain owner in order to get into the Point Blanc boarding school where only trouble wealthy kids go. after he arrives he soon finds out that things are not as they seem. Anthony Horowitz is an excellent writer and i would suggest the alex rider series to anyone who loves Spy adventures.
2,CD is NOT Vista compatible!,"The book is great. I love it. BUT...if you are paying the $$$$ with the CD as a priority and have Vista...think again. It was no where stated in the description that this CD would not work with Vista...not even on the Wiley website. I assumed, since Vista has been out for awhile and my book was purchased new off Amazon that it would therefore not be an issue. WRONG! The tech support at Wiley could only apologize and agree with me that someone should have updated that CD by now. At least he was more sympathetic than the lady at Wiley...who basically said..tough luck..if you are unhappy, complain to Amazon. So here I am!"
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"This book is not a good NCLEX review book! There were quite a few errors I found in it, and if I hadn't been sure I was right and the book was wrong, it could have seriously messed me up on the exam (I passed on my first try). Also, there are 4 or 5 questions on the practice CD exam that marked my answers as wrong, however in the rationale it said they were right! So this book is seriously flawed and I would not recommend it to ANYONE! There are plenty of other NCLEX review books out there, any one of them is better than this one."
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed to find this book yellowed with age and the cd in the back was missing. The content was decent though.
4,Electric Birds - Gradations,"There's something pleasing about the endless iterations of click and cut-based music, particularly when it's as warm and inviting as _Gradations_, from Electric Birds. ""Cyclist"" starts the album out on a neutral IDM note, but once the layers start building, as on the purring ""Nightriders,"" things seem to come to life. ""Painted Rooms"" sounds like the illegitimate love child of Akufen and Tim Hecker -- not a bad thing at all! -- while ""Astral Traveling"" blends digital funk with some nice acoustic guitar riffs. The throbbing ""Radia"" is full of warm, suspended notes with some added bits for flavor. ""Vox Canon"" sets some tinkling tones to an off-kilter rhythm that never seems to sync up quite perfectly, not even as the track's speed begins to decay. The title track serves up some of that Basic Channel dub goodness, and the final track, ""Rian,"" chugs out on a quasi-industrial dirge that settles into its groove 2/3rds of the way through. Clicks and cuts to make your day!"
2,Only two films are enhanced for 16x9,"I was hoping this would be a terrific set. After all, how can it not be with The Great Escape, Battle of Britain, Run Silent Run Deep and A Bridge Too Far? Unfortunately, upon playing my favorite of the bunch, The Great Escape in it, I was suprised to learn that it has not been enhanced for 16x9 TVs. And likewise Run Silent, Run Deep. Oddly, Battle of Britain and A Bridge Too Far both are enhanced. But why not all four??? Seems a waste to have this set because I would rather keep looking for an enhanced Great Escape."
2,They can't all be amazing,"I am a huge ASIA fan who has enjoyed the vast majority of music they have released over the years. Unfortunately, ARIA was a major disappointment for me. There does not seem to be any union of the band. This recording seems to be forced, which counteracts all previous releases.There is no energy on this CD.Quite frankly, it is almost boring. Hopefully ASIA will get back on track and Wow us with their next studio project. Let's face it....they all can't be amazing."
5,My Kind of Cookie Monster,"Florence is delightful. I loved watching her doggedly pursue her goal of ""More Cookies"" with her sidekick, Arnold, a stuffed monkey. Her determination and singlemindedness remind me of every stubborn five-year-old I've known. ""No More Cookies"" is a book children will want reread again and again."
4,Broadzilla - 'Lady Luck' (Diamond Star Records),"Good heavy rock CD by the powerhouse Detroit female trio. Got to see the gals in some corner dive awhile back in Lawrence, Kansas. Just like their live show, this disc rocks pretty solid. Tunes I dug the most were ""Ecstasy"", the *ss-kicking ""Y Did U Have 2B Psycho?"", title cut ""Lady Luck"", ""Stargazer"" and ""Four! Twenty"". Thought the so-so techno remix of ""Liquor Snatch"" was a little out of place here, but beside that, I really liked what I heard on the other twelve tracks. Line-up: Rachel May-guitar & vocals, Kim Essiambre-bass & backing vocals and Angie Manly-drums & backing vocals. Their influences were obviously the MC 5, Stooges and possibly The Runaways. They would make a nice support band for the likes of Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Kiss, etc. A good pick."
4,Vacation Reading,"I found this book while looking for a vacation book - that is, a book that makes you feel as you have been on vacation when in fact you are stuck in Paris working. This is a memoire, really, and will appeal to those who love Italian opera, food, wine, open air markets, people, Italian anything. The author drives you in her stick shift Fiat, away from the big cities, to meander off-piste (off the main roads.) I empathized that she missed her cat and her dog and her garden at home - ""A cat completes the pleasure of reading."" I laughed aloud in Venice and teared up in Assisi. I vacated."
2,Needs editing...badly!,"Like one of the previous reviewers said, this reads like a dear diary. Just as background I've read a whole slew of books on travels in Tuscany -- from ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" to ""One Thousand Days..."" I love them. Every one I'd give a 4 or 5. So, based on similarity, I picked this one out. It's a fast read, in part because half the book is stuff like ""We got on the 3:00 flight..."" or ""I told Robert to go to the store to get bread and cheese..."" Clearly this was based on a journal the author kept while in Tuscany. That's a fine basis to start a book. But the problem is, the author seems to have no understanding of an audience. Next time please PAY AN EDITOR to edit this stuff before you try to pass it off as a book for general readership. In the meantime, I can't recommend this to anyone other than the author's immediate family that were on the trip with her... In my initial write up I gave it 2 stars, but now I wish I could change it to 1 or 0!"
2,she's no Frances Mayes...,"I guess this book would be fine if you know absolutely nothing a about Italy in general or Tuscany in particular. Being of Italian descent and having recently traveled to Italy, it just didn't tell me much that I didn't already know.The thing that turned me off to this book is the author's very annoying habit of providing help with pronunciation of every Italian word or name within the text , e.g., San Gimignano (Sahn-Jim-in-YAN-o), and provides this dubious ""help"" for the same words - repeatedly (Re-PEET-ed-ly), sometimes several times on the same page (grrrrr!) What ever happened to footnotes? It seemed very condescending to me, and also to someone I loaned the book to."
1,Never received item,I ordered an X10 mini timer from this company and it failed to arrive within the time given. I waited longer then emailed them. They asked for my order number and I sent that. I never heard from them again and the device has never arrived. Stay away from this outfit.Paratrooper
3,Rear walker wheels with brakes,"The walker wheels with brakes are a lot easier on my wood floors and better than putting felt pads. They have allowed my mother to venture outside using her walker. I am concerned that the wheels seem to be spreading out over time, they dont seem to be perpendicular to the floor. We had the product for about a month, so far so good. I hope they will hold out. They could probably use a sturdier plastic."
1,not for beginners,The book was a little more challenging than I thought it would be. I wanted basic steps and lot's of pictures. It really didn't have either one. It was a little outdated.
5,Covers It All,"Author writes from first hand experience and adds in good technical details. Good examples of using common tools and professional tools to create desired results. Many examples and pictures to show how to perform each step. Many areas of framing, matting, and hanging the art are covered. Many references to the best practices are included. Overall a very well written reference book. A great place to start, but include a lot of extra material so the intermediate framer will get a lot out of this book also."
2,Outdated nowadays.... BIG time!,"I originally bought this book in Y2K.... 2000. At the time the book was current, but the steps covered in the book still hold true, but not the materials to use. Get mounting hinges that include an antibacterial adhesive. I myself have the Logan Framer's Edge 650 mounted mat cutting machine. If you are looking for a book written less than 11 or 12 years ago, look elsewhere. Look for Logan's book or other author instead."
3,Comprehensive but less than ideal,"This book covers just about everything on framing, but it doesn't really give you a feel for the whole process of framing. The topics really don't build well on each other and there's nowhere to get an overall perspective on doing a complete framing job. The author rightfully is trying not to be too prescriptive but he just presents so many options that you never get a good feel for what you should do. If you are into making frames though I think that part of the book works pretty well."
4,Value for money,"I am an amateur photographer owning this lens for last 3 months, spending every weekend for bird and wild life photography.This is a very good,solid lens. It produces good image in f4.5, and step down to f5.6 very good, f.6 -f8 tack sharp image. I got some excellent shots.Handheld, If you are upgrading from IS/OS/VR lenses. Some learning curve and handheld shooting technique required to get adjusted.My personnel suggestion for photo enthusiast like me want to upgrade to 500mm but shot of 8k then this is the lens for you.I will buy the same lens if Sigma comes with OS/VR in it. The reason is image quality is good and easy handling and portability (hoping OS not going to increase the weight a lot).If you want to see the pics taken with this lens. Please visit my Flickr."
4,"Used on an airborne camera platform,","Worked well....until the unmanned aircraft crashed...no fault of the lens. It met the needs of the system and the customer.,"
3,Good,"I bought this item for a gift and sent it way without opening. The receiver told me that it did not have a batery inside. Ignoring this embarasing detail, it still works."
3,outdated,"this is a good book for most topics, BUT totally outdated for the cardiac section. Not compliant with new ACLS protocol. Overall an ok book. I do like the CEN review by Lippencott better."
1,Not worth your money or time,"This book wasn't good at all. While at least it did try to give some hints on taking the actual exam, most were not helpful. The difficulty level of the practice exam is almost laughable, and no where near the level of the actual exam. You're probably better off with the ENA review book and then just studying in the areas you're weakest in. Or, I found the 50 question exam off the ENA website to be very similar to the actual exam, with 4 or 5 questions being nearly identical. Good luck!"
2,Would like a more up-to-date examination review text,"The layout is different and not what I would consider user friendly. I have a limited amount of time to read and comprehend what I'm studying and this book makes it alittle harder. The other thing that surprised me was that this book is not up-to-date with the current state of medicines. I found a few medicines that are not used any longer for various reasons. I'm only giving it 2 stars because I know what I'm looking at, if this was given to a new grad or intern, then this is a poor examination review text!"
1,OUT OF DATE MATERIAL,There are other more current and contemporary books out there. Date of publication on this is 1996!
3,not all-inclusive,"This book is good for practicing questions. However, you will need additional material(s) to prepare adequately for the CEN. It is outdated, and does not include many materials that are on the exam. It can be used as an ""additional"" tool to prepare for the exam, but it should not be used as an ""only"" tool."
4,"Q&A Format, a little outdated","As many have mentioned, this book is a little outdated, but it was the book that helped me the most when I prepared to take the CEN, and helped me pass it on the first attempt! The book is entirely questions and answers, divided into content areas. The answers are not right next to the questions, so you are not tempted to ""cheat"" and glance at the answer. The answers also include rationales, which helped me understand how to formulate answers, which I think was as much help as the actual questions."
2,looks like pleather,wish i had gotten the nylon holster. the snap on buttons are very stiff and pop open all the time
2,OK,"This scissor holder is ok...a little stiff to have on the belt. It looks like its built well but...I got another scissor holder on amazon that made in the USA, and built to last."
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps, if you have a Ph.D. in English, belong to the Modern Languages Association, and teach in a university where postmodernism is requisite, this is the book for you. I gave up half way through, finding these essays for the most part too rambling and self-referential - too ""academic."" If you are not a professional academic but are curious about why and how poetry moves one, spend your money on Mary Oliver's A Handbook of Poetry - half the price, half the length, and twenty times the useful information."
4,Freak parade.,"Imagine you¡re depressed. You¡ve just been dumped by your girl friend. Forget that Ho. Go out with your buddies and raise some Hell. That¡s exactly what happens tonight at the local Laundry Mat. Carl, Gill, and Jeff are shameless punks that methodically torment a variety of freaks straight out of HollyWeird, CA. Where else would you find a midget, bazaar homosexuals, and a prostitute, among several other pathetic excuses for men washing their clothes?As the story unfolds, curiously, none of the victims really possess any courage. Oddly enough, a cancer-stricken lesbian is more formidable than the so-called security guard! So naturally these inebriated thugs escalate their cruelty. For God¡s sake, Carl¡s got the chutzpah to pick on a paraplegic in a wheelchair! Even a young kid is targeted for a tumble¡K in the dryer, of course!Not your Sunday choir boy movie. But if you enjoy gut-wrenching mind games this DVD is the ticket."
5,Amazing Musicians,"Never written a review before, but I can't miss out on urging people to buy this CD.I had the great experience of seeing these people live at the Grass Valley (CA) Bluegrass Festival in 1978 or so. NEVER have I see such a combo of musicianship, fun, grace, and incredible sound. I was thunderstruck with their skill, I don't mind admitting it.I hunted for and bought their record, of course, and was delighted when this CD turned out to be a re-release of that original album, plus a bunch of new stuff. A few members have changed, but they are still great. I am going to buy another copy of this first CD, and they have another CD as well, ""Any Old Time / Crossing"", but I haven't found a source yet."
4,Very cool,Fit perfectly and has been performing great on a daily bases. I don't think I'll buy brake parts locally again.
2,Captivated,Not one of the stories had a great plot and the all lacked even a little bit of a relationship beyond the sexual exploits.
3,Erotic Romance,Ecstasy by Beatrice Small *There is not any romance in this story. Keep a dictionary handy and try to not be grossed out by the never-ending erotica.Bound and Determined by Susan Johnson ****I am partial to Susan and feel that she rarely writes anything below 4 stars. Unique plot but as always Ms. Johnson follows through with a strong female character that&#65533;s trapped but smart and determined.Dark Desires by Thea Devine ***This hero definitely has some dark desires but soon has the heroine obediently trained. The sexual manipulation was graphic though not necessary and sometimes hard to imagine/follow. The business arranged marriage plot was good though.A Lady&#65533;s Pleasure by Robin Schone ****Abigail got what she never imagined a stormy night could bring. She was just little too quick to leave when the storm was over. She was on vacation.
2,Fantasy Land turns boring real fast,"Ms. Small's story was pure fantasy; not boring in the least, but wicked in a harmless way, I guess. It puts 'normal' love scenes to shame.Ms. Johnson's story was good, as expected. There WAS a plot, after all.Ms. Devine's story was AWFUL! This guy Courtland was just about the meanest character ever made, and he was the hero! He rarely said anything civil to Drue, he just growled. The way he looked at her, as if he couldn't stand the sight of her, did not sit well with me.Ms. Schone's story was okay; predictable and cute. At least this guy was a real man."
3,This book was lucky to have Robin Schone!,"Wow! I expected so much more of these great writers, however . . . .I stopped reading Beatrice Small's offering after about 15 pages. It was completely absurd.Susan Johnson, who I normally LOVE, seemed to phone her story in. Predictable and lacking depth (but what else shoud I expect from erotic romance?)While Thea Devine's tale was very erotic, by the end of the story I wanted to kill the ""hero"". He was such a jerk and insisted on sexually humiliating his wife.The only story worth reading was Robin Schone's, and I know I can usually count on her. Not only was the story VERY erotic, but the love was sweet, and most importantly: plausible. This book was lucky to have Robin Schone.Don't waste your money, check it out from the library."
3,Schone is the Star -- Forget the others,"Robin Schone will now be placed on my automatic buy list. She's wonderful. Her story was by far the steamiest because we actually got to care about her characters. Bertrice Small's story was boring at best and laughable in that she focused entirely on the hero's ""Love lance,"" Susan Johnson's characters couldn't seem to make up their minds if they loved or hated each other -- which means I coudn't make up my mind if they did either! And Thea Devine's -- shudder. How revolting. I've read bondage porn with more feeling and more sensuality. I think it's sad that anyone might consider mental abuse arousing. Read Robin Schone. Her story alone makes the price of the anthology worthwhile."
2,I was disappointed in this book..,"...I am a HUGE Bertice Small fan..and her story in this compilation was my least favorite of all the stories. It was not romantic at all, and I found myself skipping over more and more just to find something 'more' happening in the story. A LADY'S PLEASURE was definitely my favorite story, too, as with so many of the other readers. I wish that Robin Schone had expanded this into a full novel ! But, if you're buying this book JUST to read Bertice Small's work, I'd skip it and re-read Skye O'Malley instead !"
2,Disappointing,"Robin Schone's A LADY'S PLEASURE is the only good story in this compilation of romances. A nice romance and lots of sizzle, well up to Schone's usual standards. For this reason alone, I recommend this book.However, the other stories ranged from ok to disgusting. Small's book had lots of sizzle, but it was lacking in the romance department. I wasn't able to get through more than a few pages of the Johnson and Devine stories. Johnson's hero was a boar from the first paragraph. Devine's hero was the worst of the bunch, as he was disgustingly abusive to his bride. Skip both of these stories."
5,four different stories four different flavors,This is not a romance novel. I didn't read it expecting one. With that said I really enjoyed this book for what it provided. Four different erotic fantasies. Each with is't own individual feel and take on captivity. Not all the stories will appeal to everyone. However if are open minded and honest to yourself a least one will spark the flame in your brain.
4,FOUR EROTIC STORIES,"CAPTIVATED is a collection of four short stories written individually by four female writers who are at the erotic, passion-writing forefront.ECSTACY, by Bertrice Smalls, is a fantasy of a magical land where female domination and male servitude are the rule. It's truly unbelievable, but just as erotic.BOUND AND DETERMINED, by Susan Johnson, presents a situation where a princess is married to a homosexual husband, but she must produce an heir. So she kidnaps a very reluctant Marquis who is known for his sexual prowess and fertility.DARK DESIRES, by Thea Devine, is the story of a resistant bride entering into a marriage with a man who will not be resisted. Neither is what he or she seems.In A LADY'S PLEASURE, by Robin Schone, a woman on a month-long, isolated holiday takes in a traveler who is seeking shelter from a storm. They spend two days together that change their lives.I can't wait to read FASCINATED by these same four women."
1,Only one readable story but that's a splendid one!,"Most of the stories in this book are a total waste, trying to use S&M; (which I usually have no objection to unless it's gratuitous and emotionless as presented here) instead of good writing and logical plots to carry the story.""Ecstasy"" is just plain silly with a smirking ""hero"" who fakes submission in an implausible, female-dominated society. ""Bound and Determined"" had too many nasty moments where the two protagonists snipped and snarled at each other; I got tired of them both. ""Dark Desires"" had a few steamy moments but neither character was believable or likable.However, the last one ""A Lady's Pleasure"" by Robin Schone was worth the price of admission - glorious, erotic sex with passionate characters you really care about and wish well. This one rates 5 stars, the others are just goofy trash.Buy this book used or borrow it. It's mostly going to be a waste of your time, your money and your patience."
5,Where's the ice?? I need to cool down!!,"My first foray into historical romance included this novel. After reading my first historical romance, I went out and bought this one and a few others. It's been about three years and probably five or six hundred books later, and this novel and all it's stories are still fresh in my mind. To this day, I cannot find other erotic historical romances to rival these. I recommend this novel to any erotica fan, contemporary or historical."
1,Yuck!,"1st story: Ectasy - Public humiliation, enslavement leads to love. Yeah, right. 2nd story: Bound and Determined - Kidnapped and forced to father a child leads to love. No romance, don't buy it! 3rd Story: Dark Desires - Bought to pay off the debts of the father. A virgin is humiliated and exposed to S&M all leading to love. Just made me sick. Hated the characters. 4th Story: Two strangers find each other in the night. The only one worth reading."
5,One of my very favorite books,"What makes the Merro Tree wonderful is the authors unique vision of what it means to be an artist, and her faith in her audience's intelligence. The writing is lovely and smart. I have bought multiple copies of this book to give to friends and family."
5,One of the four best books I've ever read. Ever.,"I guess I come at whatever I read from a different angle, because I'm an English major. At one level, I loved _The_Merro_Tree_ because it's a good story. It's complex, but easy to follow. The attention to detail is amazing, but it doesn't slow down the plot.At another level, Waitman's done something very special, beyond just a good story, here. One of my lit teachers refers to it as the balance of profit and prophet: storytelling and preaching. She's managed to create a balance where preaching doesn't interfere with storytelling--but if you're looking for a message, you'll find one, and if even if you analyze literature as well as read it, you won't find anything to complain about.This is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down. And the others are _Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_, _The_Summer_Queen_, and _Nineteen_Eight-Four_, if that means anything to you."
5,Absolutely unique....the makings of a classic,"This work stands in a category by itself. It adopts the universe as it's medium, but you will find that the issues raised are quite worldly and recognizable. As a musician myself, I am convinced that the author draws upon personal repetoire in crafting this amazing book. Certainly, this book is based as much upon experience as imagination. Totally genuine and honest. Not for the squeemish."
2,Too fake,"This book was so artificial, there was no reality that can be felt within the ""supernatural"" powers. While the book had a nice and unique plot, there was a few quite minor clumsy mistakes and errors that didn't make quite much sense and ties in the book, it makes you question the writer's qualifications, and her editor's."
5,WOW!,"Amazing book! Expressing concepts of censorship and homosexuality at the same time, as well as a great insight into the performing arts. Amazing!!"
4,Solid Science Fiction,Quite a good science fiction novel hidden beneath a horrible title and ghastly cover art. Looking forward to her next.
2,Side Teminal Battery wrench,"I am sure this would work on some cars with side terminals, but the side terminals I tried it on had a splined end which did not allow me to use the wrench, since the wrench has to go down over the nut...the spline would not allow it to do that.So, I cannot say that it worked well, only that I would think it would work okay."
3,NOT SILK as advertised,"The tie is extra long as advertised but is NOT SILK as advertised. It is labeled ""100% microfiber polyester"" which is obviously not silk.It is an attractive product but it should be advertised appropriately."
5,A must-read! Loved this book!!,"This author brings her characters to life. Her style, breezy conversational, holds readers' attention. The setting is fun and a place I'd like to visit! Jennifer Sinclair is a true storyteller. I hope she writes more. Her hero, Grant, charmed me with his wit and sincerity and would likely do the same for any woman of the 90's. This is the kind of romance/fiction that intelligent women have been looking for a long time - Miss Sinclair recognizes that today's woman is an intelligent reader who may want to escape for the weekend from a life of ""Business Week"" and attorneys' briefs. Miss Sinclair gives us all credit for being quick and bright and is a real asset to the publishing world. Thank you, Jennifer Sinclair"
5,These tracks are all soothing and obscure electronic sounds...,"I picked this up after becoming interested in electronic music and reading in a magazine that Basic Channel were pioneers of the minimal sound.I was sure not disappointed with this disc.It is fuzzy, atmospheric, and a dubby chill that is serene and minimal. The fuzz on track 7 is oddly serene and encompassing. Try it out-SPECTACULAR!"
4,"wrong town ignore the 4 stars, I give it 1","I am re-reviewing this cd, on first listen I liked it but it very quickly began to iratate me, unfortunately I cant change the stars, in which case I would give this cd 1 star. I hate it!I love maurizio, his and mark's music is some of the most beautiful and sublime music ever made, this cd is wrong town!, dont buy it, get the originals and enjoy them in their entirity instead.the mix is messy and far to busy for such minimal music, and he seems to make the music sound like rave doof, which is so far away from what the origanals sound like.also check out mauurizio's, burial mix and rhythm and sound release's"
2,Caution: For Die-Hards Only,"I love Greg Oblivian's work, from The Oblivians to Compulsive Gamblers to Reigning Sound. I couldn't wait to hear this CD. Unfortunately after one listen, I can't see forcing myself to sit through it again.These recordings are basically the delicate, wounded tone of ""Break Up, Break Down"" with the lo-fi sound of The Oblivians. Sounds good, right? Yeah...it's really not.I love lo-fi as much as the next guy, but this is 8 songs in various states of completion recorded on a home 4-track...or maybe even a boombox. The crappy sound isn't so much a problem as is the songs. It's just lousy material. (And don't let the title fool you - there is no band called ""The Tip-Tops."" It's just Greg.)A lot of songwriters use a cheap recorder to get down ideas and then fill out the songs. If you like listening to that, this is the record for you. If you expect some kind of attempt at a finished product for your $15, buy something else."
4,soft & pretty,"I got the ""grass"" color, which is actually a nice blue. The gloves are lightweight, soft and pretty -- how can you go wrong?"
3,Didn't clear up sores any more quickly than Neosporin.,"I used this cleanser on a dog scratch on my leg. The scratch didn't look any better after three days and was still sore. I used a thick spread of Neosporin on the wound and covered it with a Band-Aide --worked much better than the Betadine. I also tried the Betadine on my face to help clear my acne, again with no results after two weeks. While this product may help some skin types, I found it to be disappointing for my needs. I did like that it didn't sting or dry my skin, but an antibacterial soap produces the same results on my skin without the bright red color."
4,"Years later, still cat's favorite!","I got this carrot toy for my cat when he was a year old. He's now 6 and it is still his favorite. It's very durable, although it wasn't too difficult for him to eventually rip out the feathers. I've bought him several of these carrots in the past few years, and they all are still in good shape! Highly recommend this toy."
3,Feather Concerns,"My cats love this, and I like that the catnip can be replaced with fresh. However, the feathers are easily pulled off by the cats, and the potential for them to swallow or choke on them concerns me which is why I only rated this a three star."
3,"cute catnip carrot toy, not a wow for the cats",looks cute but only held the cats' interest a few minutes. not sure why but you never know with cats
5,All of my cats LOVE this!!!!,"I have four cats - two 2-year olds and two 3-year olds. They have tons of toys, and each cat has his or her preference as to which types of toys they prefer (one likes crinkle toys, one likes to play with plastic caps from water bottles, one likes to chase balls) but this carrot is now the new favorite toy of ALL of them!They can get pretty aggressive with their toys, and we've gone through many that weren't as durable as they should have been. I was sure that the feathers on this carrot wouldn't last long, but surprisingly, after a few weeks now, they're still holding on strong! Also... we have a stray cat that hangs around our home, and he's usually too skittish to play, but I tossed him this carrot and he went at it right away... he loved it! I would DEFINITELY recommend this cat toy!"
4,How to make a dog toy out of a cat toy,"The only reason I gave this four stars rather than five stars was because I had to convert it to appeal to another species. As detailed here, I love Dr. Noyes (now Kong) toys:[...]"
5,My cats love it,"Length:: 0:36 MinsMy cat Willy loves this toy. He likes the feather top, but *really* loves the catnip inside :)UPDATE: It's been a little over a year and it's STILL his favorite toy. I find it funny that my fat cat's favorite toy looks like a piece of food :P"
5,Cat and Carrot,Since I love vegetables I got this toy for my family pets as a joke (rather than getting the traditional mouse or bird). The 3 cats go nuts over this carrot toy and are constantly fighting over it. They love to hold it against their bodies and kick at the carrot or throw it in the air or smell the feathers. Great toy!! Haven't seen the cats so excited in a while.
2,Not impressed...,My cats aren't too fond of this toy. I suspect that they don't like catnip...they rather sniff shoes than this catnip carrot. It's a bit disappointing. I was hoping that they will love it cuz all the positive feedback from other customers....
5,"Provocative, daring, inspirational: Strand fans must see!","Paul Strand unquestionably had a great career in photography and is one of the all time masters. But this book of his early work shows the depth of his artistic vision. Unconstrained by commercial pressures and reputation, much of Strand's early work shown in this book is graphically stronger, more ""edgy"", and more compelling than his later work, as acclaimed as it is.If you love Strand's later work, this book, at the very least, will be meaningful to you by showing you a glimpse of the development of this great photographer. Beyond that, you may love his early work and find it compelling and inspirational, as I do."
5,Keep it simple,"Mr. Franco demonstrates the techniques that are the foundation of self defense. This is why CFA is so effective. SIMPLE, DIRECT, DEVASTATING!"
4,First movement of a celestial symphony,"In Aegypt, John Crowley creates not one, but two solid, fleshly worlds: a late seventies small town, complex enough to hold both the foolishness of failed coke dealer, scholar and desperate monogamist Pierce Moffett, and the ordinary heroic strength of newly single mother and artist Rosie Rasmussen; and the world of John Dee, court magician to Queen Elizabeth. Crowley's virtousic realism renders Dee's conversations with the angels and alchemical searching as sturdy and believable as Rose and Pierce's grocery shopping, angst, and romantic turnarounds. Both worlds can be balanced in the same book because both worlds are there to tell the same story. What is that story? What did the angels tell to John Dee? Who can catch a falling star? For all its realism, this is a book about occult knowledge. This book is an initiation. John Crowley is attempting a direct transmission of gnosis through literature. Does he succeed?"
4,"An alternate history of the world, Pierce Moffat thinks so.","Pierce Moffat had a knack for history, he easily catagorized dates, namesand places in a colored tableau in his mind. But he becameuncomfortable with the history he was taught and became awarethat possibly, potentially, there was another history of theworld; one in which the gods were real and magic and astrologywere science and worked. This is the story of his discovery,of the clues left by others, of Pierce Moffat finding hisplace in the grand scheme of the world."
3,A Little More Little Big Please,"Aegypt is my second Crowley book, the first was Little Big, a book I love. I found Litte Big to be deeply moving and significant in ways I would be hard pressed to explain. Aegypt, in contrast, came across a bit sterile to me, I felt like the author had an important idea and then had to put some people in the book to provide a context for presenting that idea. The character development seemed skimpy, their lives and problems not of great interest. I still, however, like the idea behind the book enough that I will be reading the next book in the series."
1,Don't be fooled,I went into this ready to love it. Sad to report... It's complete garbage. Unless your idea of a good book starts with senseless bore moves onto crack and whores and all hope of it turning around dies completely ... well you wont like this.
2,Disappointed,"This telephone was listed under ""Speakerphone Telephones"" so I purchased it and paid $11.00 shipping charges, while the refurbished phone cost only $17.00.When I received it, it was not a speakerphone at all. The review on the website said very little about the phone, and did not mention that it did not have the speakerphone capability.When I emailed the selling party about returning, he apologized about the misunderstanding, and said that sometimes things get mis-categorized. I asked about the return policy and he said it would be a 25% restocking fee, and full shipping charge.Needless to say I will not be returning the phone. I will look elsewhere for a Panosonic Speakerphone, and will end up selling this on CraigsList or at a Yard Sale, at a significant loss.This is the second time in a row I have been dissatisfied with my purchase from Amazon, and will not be shopping on the site in the future."
5,Great Pads!,"Maybe I'm a little picky, but I HATE IT when I'm tearing a page away from a legal pad and it rips!I've searched long and hard for a good quality legal pad and these fit the bill.I've used them exclusively for 3-4 years and seek them out when my supplier doesn't have them. They always tear cleanly and I'm able ti use every page. They may not be the cheapest on the market, but I won't take the chance on a different brand.These are definitely worth buying!"
1,WTF ???????,"I needed some of these pads and like everything else it seems I want our local Walmart doesn't carry this item. (They do carry a cheaper alternative)I figured there had to be a misprint on the 2 pads for $30. but I ordered and sure enough, 2 pads for $30. Surely no one would pay this much?? I returned mine for a refund.Great pads but at $30. I just don't know why anyone would purchase these from Amazon??"
4,CalPak Bag,Great bag - sturdy and the wheels roll nicely. Only disappointment was the color. I ordered it in the limegreen and it is no where near being as bright as pictured.It's more a pea-green.
4,good fun music,"this a great album. if you are having a party, or going to a party in your car, or partying all alone in a room in front of a mirror, this is the cd that should be playing. 10K is by far the catchiest song ive ever heard."
2,boring,"I was so sorry that I bought this book and it's sequel. after the great reviews, I though that this book had to be great. What a waste of money (and this book is expensive). Save your money! The first half was okay, the sex scenes were hot but toward the end I started really hating the main theme of this book. Lily is fat, Lily has a confidence problem cause she's fat, nobody could love Lily cause she's fat and on and on and on. every chapter and verse her size is mentioned or implied. the book would have been much better if the author dropped the ""fat"" issue towards the end and just had her be Lily. As for the sequel, didn't really feel the chemistry. stay away from both books."
5,Sweet Jesus.,"What an amazing book. Unlike most erotic fiction I've read, this is the first one I can recall where the characters and plot are extremely well developed; the storyline is great and I found I could relate very well to some of the characters. Let's face it, sometimes we all just jump ahead to the steamy parts...but with *Take Me,* I read every single word and couldn't put the book down. I can't wait to read the sequel.... This is the first book I've read by this author, but I'll definitely be reading more!"
3,It was good.,"I've read several Bella Andre books and I've really enjoyed all of them. ""Take me"" was a good book. I didn't get as invested in the characters as I have with some of the other Bella books (The Sullivan Series, which I LOVE) But it was a sweet love story, maybe a tad far fetched but its a romance novel and it delivered the steam and the romance. So, I'd recommend it!"
4,take me.,i really enjoyed this book. it kept me interested but it wasn't n too long and drawn out. i was never bored!
5,A Book That Has Everthing...,"I laughed, I cried, I could't put it down. Need I say more? Bella Andre's 'Take Me,' has something for everyone--humor, emotional resonance, a yummy hero, a fabulous jaunt to Italy, and Ms. Andre certainly knows her way around the bedroom! My! But it is the story and characters that will really grab you. I identified deeply with Lily, a real woman, a woman with deep insecurities who falls in love with Travis, a very sexy Alpha male with insecurities of his own. This poignant story will pull at your heartsrings, and leave you wanting more. I can't wait for Janica's story--I only hope its soon!"
3,Slow going,"Just got done reading the ""fifty Shades of Grey"" Series so nothing is comparable right now. Gonna give the second book a chance though."
3,Nice but not steamy enough,"I loved the idea of a big girl getting ""the guy"" but i was disappointed that it wasn't as hot as i had hoped. The love scenes are lackluster and some of the dialogue is unbeleivable."
4,A heroine whose size I can relate to....,"Although I can see why some people would give this book 5 stars, I would give it 3-1/2 stars. It really wasn't my kind of book. I consider it cotton-candy; not alot of substance but sweet. The character is a large woman (size 16) who is portrayed as wimpy and self-conscious. I like heroines who have a little spunk and fire to them (like the character in Jude's Law by Lori Foster). Some of the sex scenes were spicy, but I definitely didn't believe the first ""self-pleasuring"" episode that the heroine had in front of the man of her dreams. Actually, I thought alot of the sex was inconsistent with where the character was at that point in time in her self-discovery and growth. Still, I would pass this book on to a friend (rather than donate it), but it's not a book I would read again."
5,Amazing,Bella Andre is amazing. All of her books are hot and steamy. They also have great storyline which are realistic and keep you in the story throughout. Wonderful
5,"Romatica with a really hot guy and Tuscany, what more can you ask for ...","I loved this novel, I read it in one night. I love the smart heroine and the sexy hero. I loved that the story takes place in two of my favorite places California and Italy. This is definitely going to be on my keeper shelf."
2,not worth it at all,"I should have thought about this more but the math doesn't add up to any savings. This product is expensive and I dont see any beneftts of using it.It takes 1 bottle to make 32 oz of water that will withstand -12F. It will take 4 bottles to make 1 gal of fluid. The cost per bottle is like $2 so it will cost me around $8/ gal of washer fluid (winter strength).At Walmart or autozone, they are selling fluid that can withstand -32F at a cost of $2/gal.You can adjust the strength of this product but the same goes for the $2/gal you get from walmart/autzone."
4,different type of data mining book,"Most data mining books focus on the algorithms.This book takes a different tack. It discussesusing the algorithms and visualization within a data miningproject. Alot of the book focuses on the ""darkerside"" of data mining: data preparation, modelperformance and deploying your model once it isbuilt and tested. There are two chapters onalgorithms but they mainly focus on how to visualizethe model, its performance, expected vs actualperformance.The book is well written and easy to follow. Thehighly detailed retention case study is a nice addition.One small critisim is that the authors get a littleto much on a soap box when discussing how to justifyto management a data mining project."
5,Highly recommended,"I believe Stephen Eick, Cheif Technology Officer of Visual Insights best put into words in the Advance Praise section of the book that ""This book is a wonderful contribution and important resource for anyone building visual data mining systems. It combines down-to-earth, practical advice with thoughtful examples.""In addition, Michael Berry of Data Miners, Inc states ""As this book shows, visualization plays an important role in every step of the data mining process. Soukup and Davidson take the reader through every detail of this process, providing sample SQL code for each practical example. In fact, much of their advice on project planning and data extract, transformation and cleaning is applicable to all data mining projects, visual or not.""I found the eight step VDM methodology applicable to data mining my own data. Highly recommended."
4,A nice applied Data Mining Book,"In my opinion, there are two types of datamining books.The first type such as by Hand et' al, Han,Witten etc focus on the techniques.The second type which this book falls intofocuses on how to apply the techniques.I like this book more than other booksof the same type such as the one byHerb Edelstein because it has a detailedcase study that is built upon throughoutthe book.This book is a good example of how to applydata mining. It is obvious the authors havedone data mining in industry, otherwise theywouldn't have a section in the book on:""Mapping Business Questions To Data MiningTasks"".Highly recommended."
3,The worst Tomie dePaola book I've read.,"Most of Tomie dePaola's Strega Nona books are really fantastic. This one isn't. This book is for someone who loves the Strega Nona character, and will uncritically love any story that has her in it. I bought this one used and it looks to be an autographed copy. That won't be enough to stop me from donating it to the local thrift store."
5,Fabulous Videos For Your Kids,"This is a great collection of the best kids' books expertly animated and narrated. Heartwarming and witty, every one of these stories will not disappoint. Do yourself and your kids a favor, buy the collection. Support a quality product."
1,Do not waste your money!,"This is absolutely the worst home movie ever! These two travellers managed to take an amazing island of fun and sin and make it look like the most awful, boring place on earth. It is honestly just a home video of two older Americans in search of a margarita and Tex-Mex food! They are just amazed that you can't get a margarita in Ibiza (Hello fools, this is SPAIN, not Mexico). Equally amazed that you can't get iced tea there, or Jenny Craigs lite ranch dressing.Ibiza is a truly an amazing place. I have been there and bought this video just to show friends more about Ibiza. I am too embarassed to show anyone. This will go straight to the dumpster. Thank goodness it was cheap."
3,It's Okay,"This book provides a good overview of Durkheim's work, but since it is just excerpts it's hard to get any in depth understanding into any one particular subject. As a reference book, it is practically worthless, as there is no index. So, if you are writing a paper and think, hey, I know Durkheim said this, but I don't know where, it's difficult to figure out. Nevertheless, I suppose it does serve as an adequate introduction to Durkheim."
5,Words of Beauty,"Once you open up ""Say You Love Me"", you will not be able to put it down. I finished the book in 24 hours. With each movement of my eyes, unfolded more beauty in Adrianne's writings. I've already ordered ""Loves Deception"". I can hardly wait to read it. You have a fan for life. Among my favorites are ""I Promise"" and ""Defenseless""."
5,Say you love me,This book started off good! The end had me tears running down my eyes! I loved this book! Have to admit I have enjoyed every book I have read from Ms.Byrd
1,Terrible..,I hated this book. It took me almost a month to finish reading this boring mess. I read a newer story by Ms. Byrd and I loved it. I figured her earlier stuff must be good because the reviews were phenomenal. This book was a boring love story with black women blushing and crying tooooooo much. I have her orange book (can't remember the name) but it goes on the back burner.
2,Sennheiser Mic failure - Bad Cable,"I purchased the Sennheiser shotgun microphone last December 2006. It Just stop working during the filming in the middle of a ""Once in a Life Time"" event. Lost all the audio for the video I shot that day. Yep that's right BAD cable. This microphone has a major problem with the cable. I have been very careful using the microphone. The cable was never stretched or abused. I take very care of all my camera equipment. I don't know what I can do with this broken microphone now but I wouldn't buy another one."
2,"MKE 300, needs better cable.","Cable is junk, mic is OK. The cable is very thin and does not hold up, we've had 2 of these fail. I also know a couple other people who have had this happen to them. The mic works OK before the cable fails. It is directional and the wind screen works well.You'll be a 1/8 mono to stereo adapter for sending the mono signal to both channels on your camcorder."
4,microphone appears to work as advertised,"This was my first foray into used goods of this type so I was a little nervous to order a microphone used.It came in good condition, the corner of the box was slightly worn but otherwise fine. Seems to work well. Nothing else to report"
5,An enlightening book - wherever you are in your walk w/God.,"Whether you are ""starting over"" or just beginning your walk with God, Ground Zero, appropriately titled, is an excellent place to begin. The authors put God on a ""friendly"" level that we can all relate to. Anyone who picks up this book will be inspired by the message within."
3,For stock and bond collectors,I was kind of disapionted with how limited the book gave material on U.S. stocks and bonds. Using it is more like a small travel of stocks through the world. If you interested in stocks from other countries then this is a good starting point but if you already have experience there are much better books to have.
5,Hot but not too hot and flavorful.,It's not always jalapenos that are best for flavor in Mexican food. My grandmother made her salsa with these peppers and I haven't found a place in the East to buy them. They are in grocery stores in California and Colorado.
3,Missing a lot of chart hits.,"Like most other ""Best Of"" or ""Greatest Hits Of"" Steve Lawrence (and Eydie Gorme) this compilation falls short.This CD is missing the following chart hits of Steve.... ""Fraulein"" (1957) ""Many A Time"" (1958) ""(I Don't Care) Only Love Me"" (1959)""My Claire De Lune"" (1961) & ""Somewhere Along The Way"" (1961). That is a lot of tracks to leave out on a ""Greatest Hits"" collection.If you don't care to have all the hits and just want a taste of Steve, then this will work. There are some early Steve recordingson here that will bring a smile to your face as Steve must have been forced to try some harder rock 'n' roll than his cover of theBuddy Knox hit ""Party Doll"". By the way, Steve's version of ""Party Doll"" is pretty darn good. It reached #5 on Billboard Magazine'slist of ""Most Played By Jockeys"" and #10 on the Billboard ""Top 100"" chart in early 1957."
3,Ok for light use,I purchased this unit because I lift around 1 1/2 toms of batteries a day. This unit would have been fine for standard car batteries but the heavy duty power supply batteries were just a little too much for this. Especially if it was humid outside. The rubber grips inside the jaws become very slippery when wet.
2,The Hero is a jerk the whole way through the book,And the h was too much of a doormat for me. It was an emotional read and I felt bad for the h for most of the book. She was an innocent from the beginning and the H took major advantage of her without explaining her role in his life. She was also a fool for not questioning the way he treated her when he was around other people. I can't believe how many mistakes he made when dealing with her and his grovelling came a bit too late in the day for me.
4,Good Selections,"Having been to Washington before I read this book, I found myself wishing I had done it the other way around. Buckley's commentary offered many fascinating historical gems and covered bits and pieces not normally encountered on a tour. I appreciated his ability to balance reverence for places like Arlington and the heroes buried there with a healthy wit when it came to less reverential subjects, such as the extravagant exploits of the capital's early artists. Short and easy, this is a great read whether you've already been to Washington, care to go in the future, or wouldn't ever step foot in the place."
1,PLEASE READ! US GOVT> SAFETY GUIDELINES!!!,"Please read this and call the US Govt. Auto Safety Hotline. It is on the sticker located on the side of the car seat. 1-800-424-9393. We tried to fit this carseat in our SUV and couldn't get it installed to safety standards. I called the hotline and they said this carseat CANNOT BE USED IN SUV'S and will not be safe in an SUV, because of the base and reclining feature on this seat. Cosco and Eddie Bauer failed to let you know that. We want all of our children to be safe, so please do not buy this seat if you have an SUV. God Bless and Safe driving..."
5,Great seat,"One reviewer said that it takes 5-7 minutes just to get the get the two metal pieces linedup to buckle the harness into place. I hope this is an exaggeration. Yes, the two pieces fit together like a puzzle, but with a little practice, it takes no more time than any other carseat.I liked this seat because, when used as a booster, the belt positioners allow the car's seat belt to move freely and not leave any slack. Many other seats do not allow the free mobvement, and in an accident, the belt may not retract properly and hold the child in place."
1,Disappointed purchaser,"Even after reading the reviews, I decided to try this seat out because my son seemed comfortable in the seat. Unfortunately the negative reviews are correct. The seat belt mechanism is overly complicated, the straps twist and the car seat does not recline unless you have a reclining back seat. An adult can certainly manage these things but if you have other children that you are trying to safely get into the car quickly it is way too high maintenance."
2,I'm replacing after less than one year.,"After happily owning a Britax and needing to go convertible for my very tall 2 1/2 yr old, I settled on this seat. I had read some negative reviews, but there were not a lot of good alternatives for this size seat. I had planned to use it for many years. Two months after purchase one of the buttons that lowers the armrest had popped off and was lost during a road trip. It is impossible to lower that armrest now. Four months after purchase the recline mechanism got stuck halfway and is no longer useful. As previous reviewers noted I also had trouble with the straps getting easily twisted in the buckles and the buckle mechanism being touchy from time to time. Now that my son is over 40 pounds, I am shopping for a replacement booster seat that doesn't have the 5-point harness. I was not impressed with this seat."
4,Great car seat.....however...do your own safety research,"This car seat is great (we have 3 Cosco seats) but please keep in mind that when used as a seat belt positioned booster, 30-80lbs, the harness system within the seat does not get used also. Check with your user's manual and local police dept as for the proper installation and use of this seat. Using the harnesses built into the seat, along with the seat belts can also cause additional injuries if involved in a motor vehicle accident. One of the customer reviews stated that the mother used both the harness and seat belt with a 6 1/2 yr old. Not safe!!! Once the child fits into the seat belt booster position, remove or tuck away the harnesses."
1,DO NOT BUY COSCO PRODUCTS,Do not buy Cosco Brand products. Their customer service lacks. The chest harness broke on our car seat over 6 weeks ago and they have yet to replace it even though their web site says receive within 7-10 business days. We are out a car seat and have to go buy another.
4,Great Seat,"This is a great car seat, I looked at many different models before purchasing this one, I even purchased the Cosco 3 in 1 but took it back because it wasn't made nearly as well as the Summit Booster Seat. The only problem I have with it is that the red button to release the harness is a bit stiff and hard to push in with one hand, my other arm is usually carrying my youngest child or groceries, however this also means that my son can't get out by himself while we are driving down the road and that is a good thing."
5,The best car seat,"I bought this car seat when my daughter was a year and 3 months and weighed 22 lbs. My daughter is turning 2 in June and the car seat is still in good condition. The harness is easy to adjust, easy to clean and easy to move from one car to another. I had it inspected at our local DMV and the inspector liked it. My husband and I had no regrets!"
2,I'm not impressed...,"A friend got this for my son when he was getting too big for his infant seat. This car seat looks nice, but that is about it. It is hard to strap in, the harness gets easily tangled and twisted. The strap at the bottom which is supposed to tighten the harness, is hard to adjust. And the seat is not well padded. Also, the material is already tearing and unraveling and I've only been using the seat for about 5 months. I'm not impressed."
2,Worst car seat,"I have a britax car seat, but decided to invest in another car seat so that family members would be able to take my daughter out too. The straps for this car seat is always twisitng the wrong way, the two metal inserts take about 5-7 min just to get it lined up so that you can get the lever into the buckle. This car seat is a pain in the rear end DO NOT RECOMMEND."
2,Why Isn't It Possible?,"It amazes me that other car seat manufacturers can get the straps on their seats right, while the makers of this seat have failed - year after year. Why isn't it possible for them to get this straight? I am so frustrated with the amount of time it takes to actually get the straps fixed on this seat that I am replacing it with a Britax Regent. Should've bought Britax to begin with, would've save myself alot of time."
1,I was very unhappy.....,"I was very unhappy with this car seat, I returned it after 2 days. My son is 2 years old and wieghs about 24lbs. The straps are really uncomfortable the middle piece that locks the seat belt in place was very tight and couldn't be adjusted any more loose. It was cutting into my sons thighs. The seat part where the butt sits on is very small, unless you put a child without a diaper or any clothes on their butt will not be in place or very comfortable. The carseat was all together not what I expected. Now I'm back to searching for another car seat, until then my little one is in his Evenflo carseat that fits kids upto 30lbs. and has been used by my other child, I love it but it's time for it to go soon because he is growing out of it."
4,Happy customer,I am an Ian Irvine fan and couldn't find this book in the local 2nd hand shopsOrdered if off Greener books London for 1c thinking it wouldn't arrive and it didn't so wrote them an email asking were it was and they said they would resend it and I got it within a weekGreat-service and a great book thanks
5,Different and wonderful!,"I loved Geomancer! I was so excited to find a fantasy series that doesn't have any of the standard (and tedious) fantasy elements. Geomancer has well-developed characters with strengths and faults, a very blurry line between the good guys and the bad guys, and nonstop, unpredictable action. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the rest of the books (Tetrarch, Alchymist, and Chimaera) from Amazon UK, so I've read the whole series. It's definitely a series, so if you don't plan on continuing, the ending of Geomancer might seem like a cliffhanger."
1,"Interesting title, quite bad book.","The title of this book does not properly correspond to its contents. It is supposed to develop the general theory of nilpotent Lie algebras, but the most part of the book deals with a quite special class of nilpotent algebras, called filiform. Only the first two chapters present some general material, along with a list of nilpotent algebras in low dimensions which is full of mistakes. On the other hand, the authors use many different notations for the same objects, which confuses the reader. The quantity of wrongly ennounced results (due to misprints, etc) is discouraging, and shows how careless the final text has been prepared by the editors. This suffices to give it up.It is a pity, since there is no book dealing with nilpotent algebras only, but certainly this is not the way to write it."
1,Miss(ing) information,"This actually is about the repair manual for the full size Dodge pickups. I have the repair manual for the '93 Dodge Dakota. I was replacing the lower ball joints on this vehicle. The job turned into replacing the uppers as well. The manual states that to remove them, the last step is to ""force it out"". The upper ball joints are threaded into the A-arm not pressed or forced. In the process of trying to force it out as was suggested, I ruined the threads and had to purchase a new A-arm. Along with the lost time, I also spent money that I hadn't budgeted for this project. I would like to make you aware of this and request it be changed before anyone else has this problem. Thank you for your time. Sincerly,Adam Miles"
3,"A good book, but not a Gordon Merrrick book.","After reading all of Gordon Merrick's books, I was excited to find something new. The Good Life is a good book and I enjoyed reading it. It's a book about a young man drawn into a life that he thought he wanted but soon learned he was unable to control. Anyone who grew up reading Gordon Merrick will find many familiar themes, but may be disappointed in the details. The heterosexual sex is explored in detail, but the homosexual scenes are relegated to the background and only slightly referred to in single short sentances. It's obvious that Mr. Hulse does not share the same passion and literary style as Gordon Merrick. While this is a good book, it's clear that it is not up to the same standards as all of the other great novels of the late Mr. Merrick."
4,best story on hard working craber's,one of the best books i have ever read. this book gives an insight of life on a crab boat in the bering strait.
4,Sincere and full of insight,"I literally devoured the book. If you love the sea, and had some experience with it, it will be very easy to fully understand the powers that these people where facing. The story shows in a very plain manner the continuous struggle of mankind in order to take advantage of the earth's resources. It shows many aspects of human nature: Love for the sea. Thirst for adventure and freedom. GREED, and what men can face in order to satisfy it. And (something that people who have been in the sea for a while completely understand), the incredibly simple and strong relationship that develops between crewmates.I enjoyed very much reading this book"
4,Working on the Edge,"Learned a lot about King Crab fishing in Alaska. Had no idea why so dangerous, now I know. Had no idea so many crabs would be caught in one trap. Had no idea about the amount of money that could be made per trip. Well written. Passed the book on to my son who will enjoy reading also."
4,Puts you on deck - gritty and real - great read,"I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could - author is a terrific, no-hold barred writer with a definite gift for words. It was said by a critic about Sebastian Junger's ""Perfect Storm"" that you ""could taste the salt"". For this book I'd say the writing lets you feel the monumental fatigue and the icy water washing over your feet. It's less romantic than ""Deadliest Catch"" TV show, as it so plainly describes what real life is like on these boats.No music, just work and more work. The only thing I found a bit puzzling is that at one chapter the author waxes on about the fierce pull of the sea and goes back to the life, and the next all of a sudden he is in major burn-out mode. In any case, money well spent and deserves all the good things said about it."
5,YOU WILL NEVER LOOK AT CRAB THE SAME AGAIN,The title of this book alone caught my attention as a recommendation from amazon . The amont of money these men could make is just unbelievble but tis is definitely blood money. You read abut some of the accidents at see and they are gut-wrenching. READ THIS BOOOK
4,just like working on the crab boat,skip walker did a excellent job of setting the scene. making the story so realistic as it was. it was like i was there on every ship working right along side him every step of his journey very very well written i look forward to reading some more by skip.
4,Very well written account of King crab fishing,"This is a succint and well-written account of the fishing industry in Alaska. Too often books like this start well and rev you up in the first few pages. But after a while, you get lost in the detail and finish them for the sake of it. Fortunately this book is NOT like that and lives upto the promise it makes in the first few pages. The author sticks to the subject and presents an all-round view of how it really was. There is a good mix of information and action and there is no dull moment.This is a fast read and you will have a lot of fun while getting to know about crab fishing in Alaska. What else can you ask from a book that costs less than 15$? A word of advise: Unless you are well-versed with nautical terms, keep a maritime dictionary on hand when you read this...it will definitely enhance your enjoyment."
2,Where did his editor go?,"This book is painful. The writing is genuinely embarrassing. At first I though, ""okay, one misspelled word, it happens."" The problem was that it kept happening. He used the word abrupt twice in the same paragraph. I read the entire thing because I like books about crab fishing and I had nothing better to do. If you want a book about crab fishing, go for the ""Time Bandit."" This book is not worth purchasing; I can't believe this was published in such poor condition."
3,A worthwhile read,"If you are a fan of the show, then this is well worth reading. Enough hairy stories and personal experieinces to make you appreciate the lives these people lead and what they go through for the love and money."
3,Could be about 100 pages shorter,"I enjoyed a lot of this book, but after a while it got pretty boring. All those heroic sturdy men wrestling the crabpots around the deck, the huge seas, the long drunks. The story gets repetitious after a while, and then you start to pay closer attention to the author's style, and it does not really bear much close scrutiny. A lot of it is overwrought and amateurish, full of cliches. Worst for me about the book was that in the end I was wondering what is so heroic about risking your life to make a lot of money really fast."
3,"Good, but not like ""The Perfect Storm""","I just finished reading Working on the Edge by Spike Walker. The book had been resting on my night table for about a year. Previously I read ""The Perfect Storm"" and so thoroughly enjoyed it that I wanted to read another book along the same line. I found Working on the Edge not as compelling as The Perfect Storm which I could not put down. Spike Walker could have gone into more detail about certain events and I found some of his sentences confusing and not adding to the story. Almost wordy. The Perfect Storm is a griping story, where as Working on the Edge is an account of the most dangerous occupation in the world."
3,Pretty good but a bit boring,"I am a huge fan of anything Alaska. This book is good, but a bit boring at times. Perhaps a bit too much drama about the characters and not enough about the sport he is partaking in. Good for an easy quick read."
1,what a let down,I really LOVED her first book and couldn't wait for this one and it was a long wait - and not worth the time or money. This was poorly written with unpleasant and very unreal characters.The main character - Cassidy was so childish it was hard to believe she was actually in her 30's....what a twit. No wonder she gets no respect. There were lots of loose ends and no real development of characters or plot - which was easily figured out. It is hard to imagine that the same woman wrote both books.
2,Be The One is an outside curve,"After a terrific debut novel ""North of Montana"", I eagerly awaited April Smiths next effort. ""Be The One"" was not worth the wait. The premise is compelling, but the story never gets off of the ground. The characters are too loosely drawn and the flashbacks are so disjointed you lose track of where you are in the story. This novel is at it's best when April Smith is dishing out the inside baseball stuff. She has a good eye for detail and a good ear for dialogue but she just doesn't get it all put together with this book. I'd like to see her bring back her Ana Grey character from ""North of Montana"". Maybe she should stick with what works."
1,A waste of money,"I am amazed that the other reviewers are so enthusiastic about this book. Its contents are just a rehash of well-known (at least to some of us) principles, and do not provide any useful, real-world guidelines for actually implementing architectures. It's just too superficial, and spends far too much print on generalities.One thing that all the other reviewers also failed to mention is that more than one third of this book is devoted primarily to a ""tutorial"" for the software product marketed by the author's employer, and is, therefore, totally worthless to the general reader. A very disappointing book. Wiley usually does better than this."
5,Perfect treat for anyone who loves mint!,This fudge is so creamy and rich it just melts in your mouth. Perfect gift idea for anyone who loves mint... Order yours today!
1,Be careful when pouring...,"This teakettle is adorable and matches my dishes, but functionally, it fails. This leaks water very time I pour water into a cup. I've resorted to pouring over the sink so I don't leave a puddle elsewhere. I would suggest looking into a different teakettle...I am."
1,Corelle Coordinates Chutney 2 1/5 Qt. Whistling Tea ketttle,Thia Tea Kettle Is ok except for the pour nozzle. Every time we go to pour the hot water from it into our tea cups a large amount of water ends up on the counter!A very poor design thing. If the nozzle was about an inch longer and the end of the nozzle was smooth instead of having a rolled end I think this tea kettle would pour without spilling.
1,Rating for useful capacity only...,"Firstly, if you need 1.7Quart and a pretty tea kettle... this one is good.The 2-1/5 Quart is misleading. Based on the Max Fill label which is placed right below the spout, you will only get 1.7 Quart (1.6L). If you fill the Tea Kettle w/ 2-1/5 quart the inner spout will be covered and spillage will occur when the water is heated.If you are looking for a 2-Quart or more kettle to heat water and hear a whistle, this item will not be a good choice. The water capacity and useful (max fill) capacity are different. The spout location can be used to judge other products that indicate a water capacity."
2,Not a Premium Feather Duster,"I've been using a premium duster from Texas Feathers for many many years and this is not a premium duster. Premium dusters are made of black feathers, not gray feathers like this one. The difference is enormous. Black feathers pick up much more dust and cost more money. I should have been tipped off by the price. I would much rather have paid more and gotten a truly premium black feather duster. The service was fine but the product was just so so."
2,TOO SKIMPY!,"At this price I expected better quality, the duster is too skimpy and I considered returning it but I knew I ran the risk of buying another one of the same quality and maybe even worse with the added burden of having to go through the hassle of returning it."
2,Prends Courage,It's great to see female Cajun musicians getting the recognition they so rightly deserve. The background information and translations are a greatly appreciated extra.
4,Good frame at the price,"I bought this for my ladyfriend, who seems to be quite happy with it. Good picture, and a remote control. A bit complicated to set up, but still very manageable. At this price range, this seems to be one of the better deals..."
1,Not Satisfied,"I ordered one of these picture frames and had 2 problems with it:1. When powered-off the LCD and backlight both power-off, but after a couple of seconds the backlight turns back on and never goes off. The only way to get the backlight to shut off is to unplug it.2. Using pictures on an SD card, the display frequently showed ""jpeg data corruption"" for random pictures. It was not always the same picture. The files on the SD card were not corrupt. The ""corrupt"" pictures either did not display, or were displayed disfigured.Thinking it may just be a defective frame, we exchanged it. The second frame behaved the same way. Returning the second frame for refund."
1,Hot pixels. Beware.,"Ordered the frame and on power up noticed 2 hot pixel. Had to return it. When replacement came,frame had a crack on the side and one pixel was glowing in the midle of the screen. Returning for refound."
5,Keep up the good work!!!!!,God bless you always and I hope you continue to bless me with your music ministry.
3,It was alright,"This album could have been produced alittle better but, the material is nice. Isaac is a great singer but it is all about Bryan on anointed song"
5,More than just a CD,"I was introduced to this CD by my brother,and after listening to it I felt like the energizer bunny, I could not believe the annointing that flowed through this CD, it was a life changing experience."
4,beautiful but small,I got these to use just a single one and they are beautiful. However I should have paid more attention to the size description. Only I didn't know what to compare the size to. I do like them very much but make sure you know they are half the size of a normal comb.
5,Children Love This Book,I purchased this book for my sister who is a kindergarten teacher. The class reads a new page everyday. She says that the children love this book and look forward to it each day.
4,"I really like it, but . . . .","I have been an exuberant fan of Cajun music for years, and I eagerly purchased this CD because I find live music, especially of the Cajun variety, to be a lot more fun to listen to than the studio recordings. This is a great CD, but I wish the Savoys and Michael Doucet had handed their bass player an acoustic base fiddle instead of letting him play his electric bass. The booming bass notes totally drown out Mrs. Savoy's guitar playing so that all you hear is the fiddle, accordion, and the woofey bass. It's very disconcerting, especially on the first cut."
4,Lots of fun,"This book is so much fun. Some of the jokes are dumb but there are plenty of good ones (my favorite is ""You must know someone who is used to dealing with monsters - how about your teacher?"") and my 6-year-old son was thrilled by the menacing but not really scary monsters. The copy I bought was better-printed and in better shape than the copy I still had from childhood. Recommended!"
1,"Brit think , amer think.","Was not very impressed with this book at all, I expected a witty book comparing the differences between the British and American culture. I am a Brit living in the USA. Very dissapointed I bought two more as gifts and decided after reading to not give them as gifts but to disguard them. Wouk not recommend."
1,no bit holding,"I don't know if I simply don't get it but I cannot get this tool to hold a bit, I have read the instructions forward and backward in three languages and there is nothing about speciall bits, I went and got DEWALT bits to try it out, but they didn't work either, I saw the youtube videos and it seems quite easily to do it, but there is no way of making it hold a bit firmly. I am taking it to the service center later this week, if I get the problem solved I will post how it happened."
1,lost book & order,ordered it on 1/17 and still have not received it on 2/19. They ran out of books and told me that it would be shipped out sometime between 2/1 - 3/17. Would not recommend this buying from them unless you know for sure that it is in stock!!!
2,already broken,"After a few months of occasional use, the lamp began to flicker. Now it doesn't work at all. The on/off switch is broken and I can't get it apart to fix it."
1,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this item based on its looks. Very cool. However, I was very disappointed in how it functions. The quality of the light was poor--worse than a fluorescent bulb. Also, instead of being black as advertised, it is really gray. I am returning this item as soon as possible. To add insult to injury, I think the return policy of this vendor is onerous--I must pay a 15% ""restocking charge,"" in addition to return shipping."
5,One Cool Lamp,"I absolutely love this lamp! It appears to be very well made and designed. The parts are thin and nicely finished. It almost looks sculptural. It's very adjustable for putting the light right where you need it - the adjustable shade helps a lot. Now understand that this lamp will not light up a room. But it will put enough light right on the task at hand. I use it when doing computer work. I don't like having on overhead lights, because of the glare (on my glasses and on the screen). I find this illuminates my work well without causing undue light spread that would interfere with viewing my monitor."
1,Another switch failure,"I've had mine for 2 years. The first one got sent back after about 2 months because the lights would flicker slightly, which was very annoying while trying to read. Now, 2 years later, my switch has appeared to have died, and the lamp is useless.A pity, I love the design, but they seem to be very unreliable!"
4,I like it,"I used the provided desk clamp and attached it to the back of the desk. Since it is able to be adjusted to many different positions, I can set it up for illumination of my writing space, my keyboard or just a little extra ambient light. As I write this, the room is dark, my wife is sleeping but I have very good lighting at my desk, but not so much as to disturb her.Pros:-Very Adjustable-Thin and Stylish-Good lighting for a specific work surface. (Suitable to illuminate your work surface, but not so much for general room lighting)-Good light temperature (color)Cons:-The knobs for adjusting each joint were very tight (I had to take a screwdriver to them to loosen them up).-The knob at the base joint needs some room to swivel. The back of my desk is up against the wall, and this knob prevents it from swiveling one way. I'd recommend at least 1"" clearance behind it to give a full range of motion.-Cost (I still can't believe I just paid this much for a lamp!)Overall, I'm happy with this."
3,Just for rough estimates,"Truly this guide is not the greatest, but still, if you want a rough idea of what is needed or where to go, it gets the job done. The art in this book is fantastic. And the monster list, though somewhat flawed, does its job. If your a guide collector like myself, don't hesitate to pick this up. Just know that it is not perfection."
3,I hoped more for a GUIDE for this great game.,"I have purchased this guide because i love the CASTLEVANIA series. But i hoped more for a guide like this. For me, this guide is incomplete. It don't show us the exact time to steal from enemies.That was the main reason for my average evaluation. However, CASTLEVANIA games, are so good!"
1,I would not recommend these shoes to anyone.,"These shoes destroyed my feet. I recently purchased a pair of Keds Skimmers. They felt fine when I put them on, but after walking only 40 minutes in them, I could not walk any longer, my feet were bleeding, a section of skin about an inch long was rubbed off on each foot where the top/side of the shoe was cutting into my feet and the small toes of both feet were completely covered by huge blood blisters. Also, the back of the shoes slant inward too much and caused blisters on the backs of my ankles as well. I am in a lot of pain and have never in my life experienced anything like this from any shoe or sneaker I have ever worn. These shoes are uncomfortable and not made properly. I will never purchase another pair of Keds and will tell everyone I know to do the same."
3,A Definite Upgrade But Still Lacking,"Kino's blu-ray release of ""The Sacrifice"" is unquestionably a better release than all previous DVD versions. Unfortunately, it is also plagued by several forms of unnecessary manipulation by Kino. There are visible edge-enhancement halos everywhere, especially in outdoor scenes. The picture has also been egregiously bathed in excessive DNR, to where the image rarely looks filmic, but rather soft and digital. I'm ecstatic that Tarkovsky films are making their way stateside in HD, but you can't help but feel that the transfer would have been handled better by a distributor like Criterion, who knows how to restore films without such destructive tinkering."
1,Tarkovsky in Exile,"Perhaps one of the most boring exercises of filmmaking ever made, equal in quality with other gem of Tarkovsky- Nostalghia. Erland Josephson was not lucky in collaborating with Tarkovsky in his exile phase. Bergman was cruel when he said that leaving Russia was the end of Tarkovsky but nevertheless true. The poetry and photography don't save the film from being a complete flop. Saying this film is good is like Richard Brody trying to prove that Godard films post 60s were any good.IF YOU WANT TO LIKE TARKOVSKY WATCH ANDREI RUBLEV, STALKER, SOLARIS and MIRROR (in that order if you may)."
3,"Product works fine, but it took over a month to get a working product","When I received this cassette from the company, it was damaged and couldnot be used. I emailed the company right away with the problem. This is a $6.00 cassette, instead of replacing it with another one, I was told there were procedures to follow, and the mail carrier was responsible, etc, etc. Finally, after waiting over four weeks and sending 5 or 6 emails with no relief, I contacted a manager by phone, explained the situation and she sent me a replacement in two days.The only reason, I rate this item a 3 is because of the problems I had trying to remedy a situation that I didnot cause. (The only reason I waited so long, is because it is very difficult to find a head cleaning cassette in local stores, One cannot simply pop down to the store anymore and buy one.) The cassette does work just fine."
5,Fun wall calender,My daughter loves the colour and depth of this calender...looking forward to next years as well.
2,Not of much value ...,"I bought this book expecting an interesting inside view in the top German military hierarchy of WW II but I was disappointed. The author uses such a telegprahic language that even most names are written only with their first capital letter (I was tired for example to see hundreds of Fs instead of Fuhrer etc.) and there are some really huge chronological gaps in this diary. Even in times that Nazi Germany was waging very important campaigns (like those of the Balkans, Africa or Russia) Major Engel does not even mention them and continues to fight trivial battles against superiors and Hitler's corrupt court. In my opinion, this is not a good source for the historian, nor a good start for the layman, thus you can spend your money better in other books on the subject."
3,Lots of fun gossip === needs a better editor,"As a long-time fan of the Fairport-Steeleye thing, I had looked forward to this book through its many delays. The result was sort of what I expected -- a lot of inside information on the incredible burst of energy that erupted in the English Folk Rock phenomenon of the late 60s and early 70s.So while I read through this book in an evening I was greatly entertained by all of the authors' insider details of all of this. That was fine.The real problem here is the terrible job of editing. There were many, many obvious mistakes, typographical errors and annoying repeats of information that had been given just a few paragraphs before. Another few months of editing would have made this a much better book. All in all, however, a fun read."
1,"Hello, is there a copy editor in the house?!","I found this book on the shelf of a local bookstore and quickly snatched it up, being a fan of Fairport, Steeleye, Morris On, and all things Brit-Folk. Though the subject is fairly intriguing, it's hard to get to the heart of the matter as the writing is so incredibly muddled and confusing (perhaps they couldn't afford an editor?) that the whole book seems a little nonsensical. In fact, three-quarters of the way through, I would say that this is the most poorly written book I've ever read, which is actually invigorating, as I can point it out on the shelf when guests come over and say, ""Oh, and that, that's the most poorly written book of all time."""
3,Simplistic yet helpful,"This book is very simplistic yet helpful to the layperson regarding the necessity of friendly bacteria. Few people are exposed to his informtion and any attempt to interest readers to explore books with an index and reliable studies is useful. I agree with the sole critic that the information is too simple and without foundation. However, use this book to understand the role of your gut in over all health, then read more...A"
3,carved moulding,Bought few pieces of this moulding for my kitchen. The moulding is a SoSo made. Not as nice as the one I bought before. I was expecting much more.
4,Classy,"Atlas Homewares #A800-BN .75"" NI Nipple KnobPerfect finishing touch to oak cabinets. Gives the cabinets an updated look. Perfect accent for brush chrome facet. We could not have made a better choice. I recommend using brush chrome skinny pulls on drawers to accomodate brush chrome nipple knobs on cabinets.Metro Skinny Pull"
2,Home Repairs,"While this book does have a certain charm, constant ruminations of a masturbatory nature do not a reader keep. Austin is completely obsessed with sex and the character develops little beyond that. Completely trite, slapped-together, cliched ending is a vast disappointment."
4,Pretty good book.,"It's similar to Astronomy Today in content, but they do differ in how they explain concepts. It's interesting and easily understood by someone with a moderate background in astronomy."
5,Astronomy Text Book,"Great price! I was so happy with only paying $20, at my school they were selling it for $100. Book was also in great condition, thank you!"
2,Not that helpful,"I hope there are better books out there, because after reading this one, I'm still struggling to put together a classy shower. Many of the ideas seemed silly, and most of the games would make me run as fast as I could away from the shower."
2,Not as many genuine ideas as I would have liked:,"I would not recommend this book. I simply thought that the ideas were self explanatory - they weren't as unique as they claim. It was well laid out, but it's hard not to have a good layout for one of these books. Take another look around before getting this book, I think there are some better ones out there."
5,Great Product,I really like this product.I love the fragrance. I have used this product for many years and was fortunate to get at such a good price.
4,Beyond the 8th Step,"As a mediator, I enjoyed reading the application of the 8 steps as they apply to many types of relationships. I especially appreciated the Appendix ""Frequent Problem Areas"" addressing the ""yes, but what if this happens"", e.g., anger, stubborness on one side, resistance, etc. This book is for the more evolved who are open to peacemaking and ready to move beyond impasse in their conflicts."
5,This China Rocks!,"I LOVE this china!!! It is beautiful and durable. The plates are as big as a charger, so you can use them under other patterns for a change. I have 22 place settings of the buffet plates, pasta plates and salad plates (I have a large Italian family!). The only thing you have to watch is because the plates are oversized, they do not fit into most dishwashers. I bought my Kitchenaid dishwasher specifically for my china because it has an adjustable top rack. Otherwise, your buffet plates won't fit in. I get so many compliments on this china. Everytime I use it I am so glad I chose it. Its simple white design will never grow tiring or outdated looking. A great choice for a lifetime china pattern."
3,A Very Useful Book,"""Sin Boldly"" isn't ""The Elements of Style""; it fulfills a different need. It doesn't so much tell you how to write a college essay as it emboldens you to trust your own instincts and stop being intimidated by the prospect of writing one. Frankly, I found the first half a lot more useful than the second, but that first half is pure gold!"
4,It is definitely bold... and interesting,I found this book very useful since it helped me make my arguments stronger. Humorous and an enjoyable read.
5,Anglican/Episcopal Church 101,"First off, I am a ""cradle"" Episcopalian so I am very familiar with the Anglican way. I really enjoyed reading this book. Often I laughed at the humor of the author. Frequently I took out my highlighter to underline a meaningful passage. Many times I yelled YES!! This book is an easy read and would be excellent for a book study. It did a great job discussing the Anglican approach to authority, the Bible and ethics. I believe that if more people (including clergy) really understood the founding principles of the Anglican Church there would be a whole lot less tension (verging on schism)in our church today. In the words of Queen Elizabeth I ""There is only one Christ, Jesus... All else is a dispute over trifles."""
4,good many years ago....still good now,"I saw this movies many times as a young boy, and i really wanted to singlike the young boy at the beginning of the movie. So as i was includedin my church's boys choir one day i started to sing like the young Carusoand within seconds....i knew i did'nt have the voice....but this moviemade me want to sing...so it is a powerfull movie for some and entertaining for others...but still im glad it was made and i love singerslike The great Carusso...Mario Lanza....Nelson Eddie...Jeanette Macdonald.............they do melt your heart.Enjoy"
1,Del Monaco fans beware!,"The acting might have been beleivable in Italian, but the dubbed English was a disaster. The voice of del Monaco sounded as if it was coming from the next room and the lip synch was so amaturish that it detracted from del Monaco's remote sounding voice."
3,elec contractor,"this design is close to oem., however the terminals block the screw on the bus bar. this prevents a secure attachment and should be redesigned, otherwise Ok and glad is available"
5,EASY READ,"This book is a breeze to read and easy to understand. From a beginner's perspective, this book gives a great brief overview of helicopter flight and manuevers. I enjoyed reading this book!"
1,Absolutely worthless,"I strongly urge anyone who has any rotory wing time not to buy this book. It is completely introductory in nature. The only usefulness might be for someone before they undergo rotary wing training to gain and understanding of what a rotary wing training program is about.The back cover boasts that this book is ""an ideal supplement to ground school training."" But, it is not. There's nothing in this book you do not learn in pilot school. If you're looking for supplemental information, I would suggest ""The Art and Science of Flying Helicopters."" That is a book I would consider supplemental because it offers a different perspective on aerodynamics and maneuvers. But this ""Learning to Fly Helicopters"" book does not offer anything new. It does not offer a unique enough insight to justify it even having been published to begin with."
5,Great Beginner Book,This book immediately draws you in and teaches you the basics. The first few chapters are really easy to read and understand. It does get harder at the end but by then you're hooked. I read this one before moving on the FAA manual. If I had started with the FAA manual I would have been completely lost.
3,"Not a 17"" laptop bag","I ordered this case based on the fact that it popped up when I searched for a ""17.3"" laptop bag"" and some reviews said their 17"" laptops fit great in this bag. When I got the bag, the tag said it was for 12-16"" laptops. In my case, I have a HP Pavilion dv7 with a 17.3"" screen. I guess it ""fit"" in the bag but it was like a person putting on a size 11 shoe when they wear a size 12; you can get your foot in it, but not very comfortably. The sides bulged out and it was difficult to zip around the corners. Also, there was not much room to put accessories...namely the charge pack. I will say, the bag was very high quality. It would have definately been a keeper if my laptop and charger fit."
4,Wish it opened all the way.,"This laptop case looks very much like most on the market. The one con is a huge con. It doesn't open all the way. The main compartment only opens about 3/4 of the way. The pros are; lots of pockets for mp3 player, cell phone, camera, pens, papers and the like. Another pro is the sturdy strap with metal hooks attaching them. The main compartment has velcro adjustments to accomodate machines up to 17 inches. It is very snug and secures my laptop well in place. I would like to give it 5 stars, but the one con is too much of a con. For the price though I would have to recommend it."
5,Great Laptop Case!,"Lots of pockets - sturdy - does a great job protecting the laptop. Snug fit, which is great! Definitely recommend for anyone needing this size laptop bag!"
4,Great bag for the price.,"This bag is great for my husband's 17"" laptop. It holds the computer as well as the power brick and all the other gadgets he needs. Only drawback is that the case doesn't open up all the way to facilitate putting the laptop into the case."
4,"muy bueno, excelente","Excelente producto, muy buen precio y entrega en segun los terminos, AZUL OSCURO by Hugo Boss Eau de Toilette Vaporizador 4.2 oz for Men"
2,Nice fragrance but doesnt last for eanough time,Review updateI love this fragrance but the trouble is that it doesnt last longer.Few days ago I bought NAUTICA Voyage and it lasted 3 times more than Dark blue. That may give idea what I mean.I contacted seller to know if Perfume was original and they confirmed that this is original.I will never buy this again.Does anybody know any fragrance that resembles this one.
1,Paul sebastian cologne,My first order was excellent. So many compliments I couldn't believe.My 1st reorder wasn't as good. It didn't hold the scent for more than 30 min. 2nd reorder also from Amazon tha Sam results.Totally disappointed. I will try a retail store where I can return it
2,broke easy,My daughter received for xmas last year and it broke about 3 months later. We were very disappointed.
2,Complete shutdown within a month,"Like many other reviewers, we truly loved the idea of this toy - great for learning about money, fun scanning & mic features, acceptable color scheme - but first the mic stopped working (within a couple of weeks after Christmas) then the number screen froze but the register sounds continued. By the end of January everything had completely stopped working (the cash drawer still pops out). We, also, could not find any information about the manufacturer and the gift-giver had long since thrown out receipts. We're quite bummed. Worth noting - the LeapPad register my mom got as a freebie when purchasing a Leapster is still going strong...I hadn't liked it as much because of the fake-looking money, weird 'price tags' and annoyingly perky voice but hey, it WORKS!"
1,Peice of junk.,"We got the green and gray version from the local Toys R Us store. The drawer didn't open. You had to pry it to get it open. We put the credit card in the drawer for safe keeping when not in use. It got stuck in the back behind the drawer, and we couldn't get it out. The scanner quit working after two weeks.We took it back and exchanged it for another. The drawer on this one didn't open either. You can scan the same bar code and get different results. The cash register pronounces the number 30 as ""Eighty."" Yeah, that's the way to teach them their numbers!You should consider this a disposible toy. It's good for a few uses... maybe."
1,Watch Out Mac Users!!!,"I bought the micro vault to transfer files from my PC to my mac - not realizing that I would not be able to open the compressed files on my mac! I am now stuck without any of my files, as I transferred everything and got rid of my PC before trying to open the files."
3,Slow,"I had had 0.5GB USB of this kind, and I bought its 2GB. The 2GB is very slow compared with 0.5GB. Every condition is same with the comparison, but the 2GB is just slow. I was disappointed with the performance."
2,waste of money,Did not help much in understanding Google - Google seems to be something you have to learn about through its own 'help' button
4,Learn more,"Google Apps: The Missing Manualbe ready to hunker down and study...for a greenhorn, such as me,this book is work to understand...I was hoping for something easier to understand...but there is a lot of information to cover,440 pages, excluding the index...what I have read so far is loaded with on- line jargon I am still learning...fortunately theillustrations seem to be on the same page as the information you are attempting to understand..."
4,"Review of ""Google: The Missing Manual""",Very useful techniques for enhancing the research power of Google. Book is well organized. Index could be more comprehensive and detailed. Examples are very helpful. More examples illustrating the techniques would be disirable.
4,Just good,"Well, I expected more, may be some new tips, easy to read and some interesting data form google. But definitely didn't improve my search a lot. If you only want to sharp your knowledge it's ok."
2,Not very useful,"For me, is not a very useful book, because is only a little more of that you can find in the help pages of Google site."
3,Good,"Outside cover is great. However, the holders inside need to be strengthened. Inserting the CD makes the sides split."
1,Major Saftey Hazard Do not buy!!,"Do not buy this product it is a safety hazard! This unit was installed in my son's room and burst into flames, melted the wall socket, charred the wall and burned the carpet. We are lucky that the fire did not spread and occurred during the day when no one was in the room."
4,better picture quality,This increased the value of the picture from our wii. I now wish we had bought this with a package that came with battery recharging products. We saw it at out local Sams Club for about $30.
5,Works great for my WII,I was very disappointed the the nintendo wii does not come standard with any kind of hd tv connections when it was even the 2009 edition wii that I bought. so this one was the most reccomended as others had complaints that they may not work the best. But this hd cable works great on my hd tv. i still wish the wii had an hdmi cable connection like the PS3 and Xbox 360. but these cables have to do when the nintendo wii only has a max resolution of 480p instead of the PS 3 and xbox 360's full HD 1080p that there hdmi cable is used for.
5,Cable Does It's Job,"We were looking for a Wii component cable for better resolution on our new television, and to offer a few options on our limited video connections. The cable works as advertised - the games are crisp and clear.While there may have been cheaper alternatives, buying it directly from the manufacturer is much better than having to deal with the possibility of a defective cable."
3,Only if you Have the Money,I bought this item with money that Amazon had given me from other purchases. I believe it was from pre-ordering a game. They gave me money to spend on video games. I wanted to see what the games would look like in better quality cables so I wanted this Item. I read bad reviews on the knock off cables that are like a 5th of the price of this one but since Amazon gave me money it became the same price. The image is great. It is very sharp. Some games can be too sharp. You see more edges and flaws in the video games from the clarity. So just be careful and make sure this is what you actually want. Its not the same as getting HDMI for your PS3 or XBOX.
2,Save your money.,"I finely went out and spent the extra money and bought the ""official"" cable from Nintendo, in hopes of improving the picture on the games and movies from Netflix. It works but I do not think the 480p picture is what I would call High Definition. If I had it to do over again, I would just keep the cables that came with the Wii and my money."
3,Not a major difference,"Aside from arriving in a torn box, this product worked fine. That being said, it's not all that necessary to buy this cable if you're a Wii owner as the picture quality isn't that much greater than with use of the standard A/V cable that comes with the Wii. It only allows an output of 480p (a minor upgrade over the standard 480i) and is not, by any means, high-def (only outputs of 720p or higher are considered high-def). To the naked eye, there is no difference whatsoever.If you're a Wii afficianado and you want the best picture money can buy for your beloved toy (plus if you currently possess a Wii - you've either severely overpaid for it or spent an absurd amount of time and energy finding it), than you certainly want to spring $30 for a minor picture upgrade, but you really won't notice any difference."
4,Noticeable difference - somewhat,"Cables will make the picture improve (480p to 1080i) but is NOT that noticeable. The graininess improves, but don't expect the graphics to change remarkably. Remember the wii is NOT a PS3 and the resolution is limited! :P Worth for the price, but see if you can get a cheaper one, because I don't anticipate cheaper cables being any different."
5,Definitely an improvement!,"I bought this so I can fully use the wii to its full potential. There is definitely an improvement from composite although others might not see the improvement at all. I have a 55"" so I can definitely see an improvement. The wii unfortunately can only do 480p."
5,CABLES FOR A NEW TV,"I now own a brand new 42"" Tv with an older version of Wii. To connect the Wii to the new set, I needed to get these cables. I read review on the inexpensive cables and knock offs and learned that for QUALITY you needed to buy the Offical Wii Cables. Almost all the blogs said the same thing, you lose quality with the less expensive cables.I'm extremely happy I invested in the RIGHT cables. The color, quality, sound and everything are perfect."
3,Package had been previously opened...,"The packaging arrived torn open and re-taped shut, as if the cables had been stuffed back into it after being previously used. However, they seem to be working fine."
2,Name brand But not name brand quality,"I bought this nintendo brand wii component cable thinking I would get the best quality becouse it was made by nintendo. This thin skinny cable may be called component. But it is a very cheaply made low quality component cable. as mentioned above the cable is thin (not to mention even double insulated) , the RGB part you plug into your TV is not gold plated like all good component cables you see these days(it's copper). For half the price you could get a generic brand or monster cable that has better quality."
2,30 Bucks Worth of Meh,"Got the cables. I thought they would improve the picture. If they do, it is so slight it's nearly unnoticable. I have a brand-new Sony 52XBR9 which has a fantastic output, so if there was a difference I would see it, and I'm picky as heck (why else would I buy the cables?)These cables, in my honest opinion, are not worth it. The cables that came with your Wii will do just fine. Promise."
4,Great!,"I bought these HDMI cables for my wii for the sole purpose of decreasing the frame lag my lcd screen gives off with regular component cables. As a competitive Smash player, frames are very important. It also gave the game a bit more detail! Good price! Sadly it wasnt in a original case or anything so if they gave me a used one i wouldn't have known, but it works well."
4,Wii official component video cable - works as intended,This review is for the official Nintendo Wii component cable. I purchased this cable to add a second setup for the wii in a bedroom and still keep the original cables hooked up to a big screen TV. The only reason I purchased the component cables was the price. I wasn't expecting any improved video quality because the Wii is limited to 480p video output.
4,What you'd expect,These allow you to bump up the resolution of the Wii a little which is nice. It makes a small difference which I appreciated but it certainly isn't a must buy.
3,did not notice much diference at all,I bought the original Nintendo cable over the generic because I was told by Nintendo that generic voids the warranty and did not want to risk it. The cable looks thick and sturdy; length is adequate.I did change the wii settings to wide screen and 480p as suggested to fit my new lcd tv.That being said I do not notice much difference at all with the old cable that came with the wii. My son that uses it all the time says he does not notice much improvement on Rock Band 2 as some other reviews said either.
5,Need these for widescreen.,These cables are the official Nintendo cables. They work great. These cables will give you true widescreen (not stretched) for games that support it. They also allow for progressive scan for games that support that. The graphics are somewhat better than with the composite cables for the games that I have used them with.
5,Whatever the Princess wants.,"Didn't really understand the whole HDMI vs RCA connection thing back then. But, my ""Princess"" wanted or ""NEEDED"" this. After hooking this up , WOW. Now I understand."
2,Try the 3rd party,"Works fine, except you can't spread out the audio cables from the video cables by more than about 6-8"". This makes running video to your TV and audio below to a receiver impossible w/o having to buy coax audio extender cables. Just plain dumb. The standard cords that come w/the Wii allow you to split the wires as much as needed."
5,Get the most out of your Wii,If you have the cash and you want to get the most out of your Wii then feel free to purchase these cables. Overall its a good product and would recommend this if you have a HDtv and mostly play your Wii.
5,"word up, component like a mofo","like everybody's already said, this won't make your wii up to par with the xbox360 or ps3 (not that you want to; graphics don't make a game, fun does). however, better quality games like re4, zelda, and prime 3 look that much better, as well as the channels. must buy for those with component-ready tvs.btw, halo 3 is a joke."
3,Not That Much,"These cables aren't that good. They do make the Wii Menu look a little better, but they make the 3D looking games worse. You can see more jagged lines, and things. I wouldn't pay $30 for it. If it was $15, it would be okay."
3,i have a new 50 panadonic 1080p i think thats the number,i dont really see a dramatic difference but its ok i put it in and it look a bit better but when my 360 was in i saw glorious graphics i mean unbielievable anyway plain and simply the wii wasnt made for hd
1,"Excellent cable, but pricey",Giving one star being double the price.Search for Wii HD Cable and buy NYKO or MadCatz for $[...] (half the price)Same quality. You must set Wii output resolution to 480P to see the real difference in picture quality
1,Not a necessary Item,"Truly, the Wii is not designed to take advantage of a product like this. The graphics simply don't require a component cable. Of the games I have, I have not seen a difference on my 42"" plasma TV between this and the original connection cords. I would NOT recommend this item."
4,Great Cables - Too bad the wii max's out at 480p,"These cables are the best you can buy. Anything MadCatz is very cheaply made.However, the graphics are still - ehhhh, so-so.I'd rather have seen Nintendo try and go all out and go for HD (720p, 1080i, 1080p). It's a little disappointing. Yeah the controller can be nice, but I'm looking at graphics that are no better than my 7 year PS2 (or xbox, etc)."
2,"This Cables work,BUT stay way","having used this cable I recommend you buy a less expensive because it is the exact same image quality is obtained and you will save some 30 bills, now I have one that cost me $ 4 and I regret having bought this cable so overpriced"
3,"Works fine, but has a MAJOR design flaw","I have a 42"" HDTV, and I have to admit I didn't notice a big difference in the video quality by using this cable, at least in Wii sports, which is a very simple game graphically, but it was an improvement.This cable has a MAJOR problem which another reviewer mentioned - the audio and video cables cannot be separated by more then about 10 inches, making it nearly impossible to plug the video and audio into separate components, such as a TV and home theater receiver.This was just simply a boneheaded and thoughtless move on Nintendo's part, especially since the Wii-supplied cable does not have this problem."
5,Works as advertised,"Got this cable for my son's Wii. We have it installed to view on a 92"" HD projector system. The video using component signals is much improved from the composite cable connection that comes standard with the game. Good and cheap upgrade to your Wii if you have a large HD screen for viewing."
3,Too good for its good.,I have a top of the line 50 inch Samsung HDTV.I change the setting on the Wii so it would work on my HDTV.The problem is its too sharp so edges appear jagged.So I changed the setting back and leave the cables connected in case I get any Wii games that will take advantage of the HDTV.
1,Ripoff,"Anybody paying $30 for these cables are spending $10 too much. Mad Catz makes the same cable for $20, also on sale at Amazon. I own the Mad Catz cables and they work great."
1,Is this thing for real?,"After reading many stellar reviews from this site, I was sure that this would be a decent buy. With the Nintendo branding, you can't go wrong, right?Before I plugged in the component cable, I decided to turn on my Wii with the composite cable to get an accurate comparison. Composite = grainy, blurry. Component = sharp, pixelated. By the way, i have a 52"" Sony Bravia LCD HDTV.With the settings configured for 480p and widescreen, the aspect ratios still seem a bit off. I haven't turned on my Wii since then. Thank God for Xbox 360 and 1080p."
3,Not bad yet.....,"Don't get me wrong, Mychlael Danna is a wonderful artist but this CD is a dissappointment. Some of the songs are good, but the majority are rather mundane and three are absolutely terrible. Buy one of his other CDs but leave this one unless you are desparate."
2,disappointed,"I love Marvin Gaye and have lots of his recordings, however I hated this CD ashe spends most of his time talking and would never reccomend this onetotal waste of money"
5,Small Platter is Perfect for Entrees,"Do you enjoy entree salads with grilled salmon, tuna, or chicken? If so, this beautiful handpainted Willow Blue 12-Inch Oval Platter would be perfect. Why keep your small platters in the china cabinet or cupboard when you can enjoy them for everyday use for antipasti or entrees. I love being able to put my whole meal on one oval platter, even if it is Chinese takeout.If you are ordering Willow Blue placesettings, be sure to order two of these platters, too."
4,"Lengthy, Interesting, and Entertaining!","This was a great book! I am cursed with the ability to read very quickly, therefore I REALLY appreciate lengthy, meaty books and this series fits the bill. I also really enjoy dragon and fantasy books that aren't all fluff, but also do not delve into the dark realms. This book is a great read for anyone who enjoys fantasy, adventure, and excitement!Happy Reading!"
5,Good book,Great book and I loved all his series! The characters in his stories always make me laugh! A must read!
5,The Candlestone,Although it was not as good as the first one The Candlestone was still an amazing book. As the story goes on the action and excitement gets thicker and thicker.
2,Bland,"None of the previous Wallflowers albums are masterpieces, but they all contain several distinctive, memorable songs. Everything on ""Rebel, Sweetheart"" just blends into mush. After a few listens I can only remember the melodies of ""God Says Nothing Back"" and ""The Passenger."" The Wallflowers are a likeable band and I wanted to enjoy this album, but it's just too bland and boring. Time for Jakob Dylan to try something new."
4,Splendid.,"The fifth cd by the Wallflowers is simply amazing. Although their previous albums were great, Rebel Sweetheart offers a deeper and more poetic side of Jakob. the lyrics to every song on this disc is simply beautiful. There are no other words to describe it. When listening to this cd, it makes me want to be apart of the song, the words, the music... I want to dive right in and be apart of what make this cd so wondrous. This is a must-have for all Wallflowers fans and basically for anyone that has an admiration for beautifully crafted work of art through the splendour of words."
5,solid album,"a classic wallflowers album. they tried too hard in red letter days, and you can tell they are back in their element with this album. a really chill, thoughful album worth your money."
4,Coleman air mattress,This mattress is great when you need the extra bed. My children love the mp3 player built in.The only problem I have with it is I wish that it had an electric backup source for the batteries.
3,"Umm, it's sorta froofy","Judging by the reviews I had read here I was expecting something not unremarkable, but really this is just old-style New Age with a few added flavors.Even the old Cosmos-like analog synth stuff wasn't all that inspired, and much of sounded like it was trying to rehash Vangelis' original concept.Sorry; unremarkable."
5,Magnifico!,"Funny, sweet, tart, poignant and very insightful. The dads are too much - I especially liked Whitman - no one could ever hope for a better ""faux pa."" Actually, I should say I loved Whitman, because love is what this book is all about.What's Italian for ""Bravo!""?"
2,A weak sister to two masterpieces,"As a corporate executive, I am always seeking material that will provide new insights into ensuring deal success. This book doesn't offer much. Many of the major findings I've either read before in newspapers or come straight from the pages of more detailed books on how to succeed at M&A. There is not a lot of detail on following through with particular strategies and the idealism of the authors suggests that they have never been true players in the process. This book seems like a diluted version of the two pioneering books that have already said it all --""Joining Forces"" and ""Winning at Mergers & Acquisitions"". In my opinion, no integration can truly work without implementing the guidance set forth in these two masterpieces."
1,Fahrenheit 451 Revisited,"Reader, this is one book that does not require the attention of Captain Beatty and the Mechanical Hound.It is so damned dry, put it anywhere near a naked flame and it will combust spontaneously.Sure, it is important to track the performances of Mozart's works during his lifetime in a place like London but why read about it? Even bald-headed scholars would defoliate completely upon surveying this tome.Why look for the living among the dead?"
1,not for young women,"On my skin, this is just a bland, flat floral with poor lasting power. It projects a soapy frangrance on clothes and lasts a bit longer. But my detergent can do that too - don't need CK for that. Sorry, didn't work for me."
4,Very Nice Fragrance,"Nice, light fragrance that can go both casual and dressy. I wear it almost every day and always wear it to work. The scent lasts all day, which is a plus. I get nice complements from this scent.The perfume does not seem that popular although I don't know why as it seems to appeal to people of all ages due to its pleasant scent and fair price. I think Calvin Klein does not market this perfume correctly and that limits its sales."
5,Very good parfum,"My wife asked me to buy some for here, if I find, as this parfum is not produced anymore. I bought 3."
5,We've come a long way! Thank goodness.,"Funny, entertaining, and educational. A great read if you are a foodie. Lots of recipes you may have heard of as a child. Examples: Kraft Music Hall Clam Appetizer Dip, Wacky Cake or Crazy Cake, Mystery Cake (that's the one with the tomato soup in it). Have you heard of the ""Mystery Chef"" (pg. 51)? He's from the 1930's. There was ""Marshmallow Madness"" in the Thirties. Do you know what a Wedgie Pie is? How about Bomb Shelter Chocolate-Cherry Delight Cake or Baked Beans Au Glow-Glow. I'm sure you heard of Jell-O Cake or Tang Pie. Remember Trader Vic? His Chinese food and tropical drinks. The book takes you all the way to the fusion cooking of the Nineties, only a couple of recipes in this section. Otherwise, loads a really good recipes. There are even a few crazy crazy recipes that you are told not to make. A fun book to read."
5,Wonderful,A great book ! I spent the better part of this year reading this book. But the beauty is that does not pose a problem because the writings included in this work are all relatively short. Make no mistake this is a very long work but well worth the effort. Especially since it is a collection of an incredible number of very short works.The collected works are as the title states contemporary accounts. It is a real treat to read what the contenders had to say about each other. Also the reader may think that the style will be difficult. Not at all.All in all I would most heartily recommend this work for either the student who would like a resource or anyone interested in The Revolution.
5,The Type of history book that I love,This is the type of history I really enjoy. We are seeing the events through the eyes of the peopleinvolved and not through the gloss of future historians. When a historians writes of events theyknow for the most part what happened but because the people whose writings are collected in this bookdon't know what is going to happen I feel that we get a truer sense of what happened and what theyactually thought at the time . Any work of this nature will leave some things out and the editorsseem to be focused more on the northern aspects of the war revolution then the southern ones.
4,"""Tribun"" is outstanding, if you like radio plays","Kagel is a gifted but eccentric composer, who seems best in a theatrical, multimedia or radio play setting. This CD contains two humorous but also serious (typical of Kagel) radio plays on the themes of dictatorship and demagoguery. ""Der Tribun"", which won Germany's prize for best radio play of 1979, is highly recommended for those who like the (apparently very German) radio play art form. Warning: lots of spoken German and no English libretto, but it's quite possible to grasp the themes without understanding all the words."
5,My Favorite General Purpose Flashlight!,"All I wanted was a water resistant, easy to use, D cell, flashlight. I've been using Dorcy Flashlight and Maglite flashlights for years! For my car, I prefer the Maglites (3-4 D size) - heavy aluminum and can be used as a hammer if need be. :) But for around the home, I prefer the Dorcy. Not just any model, but this one in particular since it's BRIGHT BLUE! Yes, even in low light you and spot this little guy when you need it for working on your computer, or going behind your entertainment center, under your couch, etc...I only buys this model for home. I don't really like the C or AA sized flashlights since I lose them too easily or they don't have much power/light. This flashlight is a nice balance between the small ones and the large models.Recommended!"
4,A Virtual Journey to Tibet,"This book is a travelogue, guide to Buddhism, lesson on the China -Tibet conflict, and spiritual journal, all rolled into one. Cameron uses a unique blend of first and third person to describe her experiences, thoughts, and converstations as she travels with a group through China and Tibet. As a reader, I could feel the physical challenges she faced during this arduouous trip and I struggled along with her as she sought answers to spiritual and ethical questions. I found myself wrapped up in this journey and I was thoroughly engaged by her honest and rich descriptions.I recommend this book to readers who are considering travelling to Tibet, to anyone wishing to develop a greater understanding of Chinese-Tibetan politics, or to those who want to explore Buddhism alongside an American Jewish woman."
3,Decent material for the absolute beginner,"Attempting to install Apache following the authors' instructions will not amount to getting started anytime soon. However once you get past these issues, you will find he has done a decent job of providing an entry level for the complete newbie.Mind you, if you have any previous experience coding PHP or SQL the provided examples are not for you: buy a different book."
1,Don't bother,Has the author actually tried to do a PHP/Apache installation on Windows2000? Strange he didn't come up against any of the same errors I got when I followed his instructions (several attempts)
2,You will need a PhD in vocabulary to read this book,"I am studying how Christianity has changed since the early church. This book may well add insight to the subject. However, my education level does not encompass so many of the words the author uses. I needed a large dictionary for each paragraph I read. Maybe I'll pick it up later when my research progresses to a higher level."
3,More fluff and repetition rather than substance,"This book has some good information, but there is a lot of fluff and repetition, as well as empty pages for you to write notes on after every chapter. If the book were printed properly without so much double-spacing and blank pages, it would be less than half the size.The book seems to be directed at parents, yet the authors write as if children are the readers. As an adult reading it, the writing style gets annoying rather quickly. And if your child is a sophisticated reader, he or she will probably be annoyed by it as well.Borrow it from the library first."
2,thirsty little bugger,"I bought this printer because it was the cheapest available, and I was in a situation where I needed a printer for just a few weeks and then I had to abandon it.Unfortunately, this turned into a bit of false economy on my part: I failed to consider the cost of the cartridges (with this thing, you'll need the 17 for Black and the 27 for color). Together MORE than the cost of the printer itself.The cartridges are used up so quickly that any money you saved on the machine will be lost on the cartridges.You're better off buying a middle-of-the-road HP printer, as the quality is slightly better and their cartridges last so much longer that in the end you probably will end up spending the same amount of money.Another thing I hate about this printer is that there's no way to stop that irritating voice from saying ""Printing started!"" etc. You've just got to endure him."
3,How to stop it from talking,"To stop this darn printer from saying ""printing started/completed"" you need to go to the Lexmark SOftware Center. There should be a voice option in it. In mine, I had to click on ""troubleshooting"" then ""voice/skins"" and then I had the option of unclicking the sound option."
3,"Great for text, but not for photos","This is a good printer for regular print jobs, but it does not print to photo quality. If you don't print photos from a digital camera or if you are not concerned about photo quality then this is the printer for you. It is a cheap, easy to install printer that will handle your daily print duties, but photos are pixellated and off-colour."
2,"Penny-wise, pound poor","The title pretty much sums up my feelings about this printer. To begin with, as others have noted the cartridges for this model cost too much and you will find yourself buying a lot of them. I do a lot of text printing and even though I use the most ink-economical settings I can expect to go through an ink cartridge every two months or so. Also, after a year and a half of use, the piece of plastic that holds in the printer cartridge broke. I don't know if this is typical or not, but the way the plastic is designed to flex in order to lock the cartridge in place seems like it would inevitably break with day-to-day use (can you say ""planned obsolescence""). This product waste's money in the long run even if it is cheaper to start."
1,Keep looking,"Bought this printer today. I didn't buy it from Amazon, but instead, went to a ""super store"". Tried to connect it to my Sony laptop with no success. Software did not work. Called the Lexmark support line and got no help from the rep. He steered me all over the place, including downloading additional software from the Lexmark website. It still does not work. I finally gave up. Since I can't return it (no returns on opened boxes), it will now reside in my closet. For the entire 5 minutes that it did work, it was very noisy, slow to print and rattled my whole desk. Next time I'll spend more and hopefully, get more."
1,Deafness enhancer,"I bought a couple of these whistles, and must say I am disappointed. The shape of the whistle, this may not be clear in the photo but it is J shaped, seems to point the sound right back towards the whistle-users ears. I was almost stunned when I gave the whistle a big blast. Yes, the whistle doesn't cost much, and in this case you get what you pay for."
4,The Good Conscience,This is an excellent novel written by Carlos Fuentes that describes a struggle between self-integrity and self-interest.
1,Wouldn't let me un-install it... shut down my internet connection,"I installed this last week. After installation the program would not open up, deactivated my firewall, would not let me connect to the internet, and would not let me uninstall.I called customer service at Computer Associates... the woman I talked to barely knew what she was talking about and said that a tech person would call me within the hour. I called back 3 times telling them nobody had called me back. The suggestion they gave me was to go to the online support. Which since their product prevented me from having internet access, was very ironic. It's been 3 days, nobody has called me back, and I was forced to reintall the entire Windows system to get rid of this awful software.Definitely save yourself the trouble and get a different antivirus software."
1,Terrible experience,"This software is the worst I ever had! When I try to install the software, I had entered a wrong option & try to get back to the last page and correct my mistake. Turn out, it hung my session & I have to power off my computer. Then after I re-logoned, the software continue & completed the installation. Then my nightmare begin. Everytime, I turn on my computer, within 3 minutes, my whole computer will be hung & got no response. Trying to uninstall the software, & there is no entry exists on Add/remove program on control panel. Then trying to contact CA support, they said I can only login with the id that is provided when the installation is completed. Since I never successfully install at the first time, I never got the id to log in CA suppost web site. Of course, I can spend $29.99 for a call on the phone line support, but I decided I will reformat my computer & never use another CA product again!"
3,Decent in general,"I think it has trouble with XP Media Center, I have heard that elsewhere as well.I work for CA, but not on this product. But I got a free copy for home, so I tried it. I prefer the McAfee free stuff from Comcast, but the CA one is fine for the second PC."
1,Horrible Software!,"Found the registration number difficult to read. Had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time! The I's look like 1's. Tried it again! I got it to load. My computer slowed down significantly! Certain sites I could not access anymore without re-configuring the software. I have used Norton. MCaffee or whatever, and other suite type security software. This one was the worst. I would not recommend it. I got a well deserved refund."
4,Computer safety,"I found the program easy to load, but a little confusing once loaded. It does slow my computer down a little but knowing I have greater protection I can put up with the reduced speed."
1,It does not worth to try this software even if it is free.,"The license is for 1 year, and it will expire 1 year after the first time you installed it.(even if you decided not to use it later).It is easier to get Norton suite and the software seems better."
1,I bought this at Circuit City,"I installed this twice. One time I installed the whole thing. Later I installed just the scanners. Both times my computer was so screwed up that I had the reinstall my os which is XP Media Center edition.Some of the problems this software caused include: being forced to insert my sonic software cd at every bootup, my computer freezing up every so often, my computer abruptly shutting down, not being able to boot up successfully, and not being able to access my dsl connection.CA should be sued for selling this junk."
1,Bad Software,"After installing this software in to My PC. Some functions of my keyboard stopped working. Even some multimedia buttons disappeared. After that I had to concatct HP to download drivers again.Even after installing the drivers, it did not start working as beore till I uninstalled this third rate software from my PC. After uninstalling every thing got fine. I will not recommand this soft ware to any one."
1,Customer Support???,"Installation nightmare!!!!This company has no customer support. It blocks your internet access. Shutting it off doesn't work; you have to uninstall it to get your internet access back. Then if the FAQ page that they have for customer service doesn't help (which it won't), the require that you fork over 19.99 for help!!! Stay away from this!!"
3,Protection Objection,"These days, if anyone owns a computer, they have to purchase protection software for spyware, firewalls and anti-virus. Although there are many different kinds of popular brands like Norton, and McAffe that have n't done very well at protecting against these certain brands. For EZ Armor and CA's Etrust, they do a mostly good job at making the grade at computer protection. Their Internet Security Suite delivers good quality service on some programs on protection, like Anti-Virus and firewall. Unfortunately, the anti-spam and spyware prtection doesn't actually deliver well, and if you have other internet protection software for spyware, it could definitely interfere either way. I suggest for those who just need an anti-virus software to get this. Otherwise, get something that might be better for your computer.Price: CConvience: C-Protection: C+Overall: C 1/2-"
2,Very disappointed,"The sound quality on this phone is terrible. There is an almost constant low static sound in the background (despite many attempts to change the channel). There is also lot of echo and even at the highest volume, you can hardly hear the person on the other end of the line.There are a few things I did like about the phone. First, it has a directory for storing up to 40 phone numbers, including the name. Second, you can choose from 1 of 4 ring tones or turn the ringer off. Lastly, if you mess up dialing a number you can backspace to fix it rather than re-dial the whole number.This phone will be going back as soon as possible because if the sound quality isn't there, all the bells and whistles don't make a bit of difference."
2,A Piece of V-Junk!,"I bought this phone a year after it's release date when it was on sale and the newer model was introduced on the market. The phone was primarily a bedroom phone so (very little to no use). Then in the past 3 years the original battery died. Fine, bought an equivalent replacement and all is well. No, the caller i.d. began to fail to the point where I couldn't even recognize who was calling me. The last straw was the replacement battery has now failed. There's more complaints I could mention, including display screen and how hard it is to hear the caller, but I've said enough. Extremely disappointed with the phone and I will never buy v-junk again. My primary phone (At&T) which is 15 years old is still rockin. Considering the v-junk only cost me 19.99 I think I got my money's worth out of it."
2,doesn't hold up through normal wear and tear...,"I completely admit that I dropped the phone once. It fell off a kitchen table -- not down a flight of stairs. I can no longer hear from the ear piece, but the caller can hear me. I can now only use the phone with my headset. Like I said, I admit I dropped the phone, but one fall shouldn't have done that much damage. The phone is only 5 months old and I'm already shopping for a new one."
5,liderazgo Espiritual,"Excelente libro para lideres y para preparar nuevos lideres. Lo recomiendo, no debe faltar en tu libreria personal. Nos da erramientas para lidiar con asuntos del diario vivir de un lider y para convertirnos en excelentes liders leelo."
2,Warning: this is just the book version of the movie,"Would not have bothered with this if I knew it was just a book version of the movie. The movie stunk & was in no way true to the Mr. Bean we've all come to know and love, except for the material that was lifted directly from the TV program which we've all already seen for free."
1,not new cd's just a package of allready produced cd's,These were not newly produced cd's. They were a composition of cd's that had been put out before.
3,FPS Creator,"The level making system is impressive, physics are good, but the graphics and AI leave some to be desired, the graphics and AI look and act like, Half-Life 1 to Unreal tournament 1; And lacks outside terrain. But it is very fast and easy, you can get used to it in an hour and form there you can have a good 1-2 level game in 30 min. But I think you should find out for yourself, go to ""fpscreator.com"" and check out the demo."
2,FPS Creator,"This is an interesting product, you can make your own FPS game... unfortunately it's only good for bare bone halls and corridors, if you add more than a few`entities' to make the level interesting, the game runs slower than molasses in January...the models are rather sloppy, and of low polygon count. There's nearly no provision made for outdoors, trees are not included...the `getting started manual' is a tiny 15 page document that doesn't really explain much, there is a more useful manual on the disk, but you'll have to print it up yourself...You get WW2 European theater Germans, British and Americans, and a selection of sci-fi characters with the purchase, if you want human zombies (there are odd `space' zombies included) you'll have to visit the FPSCreators web site where you can purchase additional costly `model packs'...If your interested, then you should download the trial software from the FPSCreator website before you buy this, or like me, you may be disappointed"
3,"An ""ok"" software",The FPS creator makes it sound like you can create anything you want. Makes it sound like a dream come true. I am not dissatisfied with the product I am just a little bit disappointed. It only gives a few weapons to choose from. There are Sci-fi weapons or WW2 weapons. Then when you go on there website they want you to spend like 10$ just on one of the weapon packs they have. There are ways to create your own things (not included in FPS creator) with other softwares and stuff. Its complicated though. I would recommend this to anyone but also tell them everything about it so there expectations dont get so high like mine did. This is easy to use with what it has.
5,Excellent CD,"This is a great CD from Rich. Track 5, Harmonic Cluds is the greatest - it should be re-done as a 60 minute piece for complete relaxation."
3,"Doses of Greatness, but...","Robert Rich is an acquired taste. His music can be as erie and unsettleing as serene, with mixed results. ""Gaudi"" has the spellbinding, ( Sagrada Familia, Air, Harmonic Cloud ) the dull, ( Tracery, Spiral Steps, Mosaic ) and the truly creepy (Serpent). ""Minaret"" would've made a perfect sleep-therapy piece if it wasn't so damn short. Anyway, the album, like the rest of Rich's work, is uneven. The good being good, the weak weaker. He seems to improveing as he ages. ( Like wine, yes? ) If you find it used, it may be worth it."
4,Another great read by Spencer,"Wish he would write more books. I discovered him in the pages of Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine and ran right out and got Resume With Monsters and Zod Wallop. Loved them both then read Irrational Fears, my favorite of his. Picked up his short story collection The Return of Count Electric and throughly enjoyed it also. I waited several years for this one, hoping to find it on a bookstore shelf. Finally ordered it from Amazon.You can see a lot of the elements here that he reused and refined in later novels. Very captivating characters and storyline.One personal judgement: I identify with the main characters in a book while reading and if I don't like any of them, usually do not enjoy the book or stop reading it. For me the mark of an excellent writer is when I don't personally like any of the characters and still want to know what happens to them. Mr. Spencer. Please don't stop writing or resume if you have stopped!"
3,Interesting early work...,"I really love W.B. Spencer's work -- I first found RESUME WITH MONSTERS, then ZOD WALLOP, then RETURN OF COUNT ELECTRIC, and IRRATIONAL FEARS is waiting to be read. MAYBE I'LL CALL ANNA is an interesting story from his early career and good in its own right. Definately a worthwhile read."
2,"An early work, not worthy of his later books","I'm sure it got better, but the first 50 pages bored me to tears and I just put it down."
4,ANGELUIS,"GREAT READING, INFORMATIVE, AND FLUENT AUTOBIOGRAPHY. MS SHARMA GIVES US VERY DESCRIPTIVE DETAILS AND ACCOUNTS OF HER EXPERIENCES GROWING UP IN INDIA. SHE IS VERY OPEN AND STRAIGHT FORWARD, NOTHING IS HELD BACK. SHE IS NOT ASHAME OF REVEALING FACTS. NON-STOP READING."
4,Electronic Bank ATM,"My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas 2006. The bank still works and she uses it often. She has not had to replace her batteries since she got it and she accesses it about once or twice a week. It is essentially a calculator and my daughter likes it for that reason. She doesn't have to count her money. It receives a low educational rating for the reason she likes it. The calculator does the work and manually adding and subtracting money is a great way for kids to sharpen their math skills. The only thing my daughter doesn't like about it is that it doesn't have an entry for $2 bills. However, I would consider this a minor drawback unless someone collects $2 bills."
3,Kids love it but bill reader doesn't work on 2 out of 3!,"I got 3 of these, one for each of my older kids, they love it, but on 2 of them the bill reader will not take the bills! That is not an acceptable rate of failure for the price you pay."
4,A really cool bank,I think this toy is very fun and useful.I really liked it and i recommend it . It also teaches good money skills.
5,A great tool!!,"I purchased this for my almost 6 year old. He had no trouble figuring out how to use it and it works fairly well. It has helped him grasp the meaning of saving money to work toward a goal. It has also motivated him to want to save. He recently started receiving a weekly allowance. Now he is responsible for saving to buy toys that he wants. It has elimiated the ""MOM, can I have this?"" everytime we are out. After I told him a few times ""Do you have money for it? Do you want to spend your money on it?"" the begging has nearly disappeared! Highly recommended.The only negatives I've found are:1) The dollar bill intake does not always work - it can be circumvented by opening the safe and making a manual deposit2) Sometimes when depositing coins, if the coin doesn't go in the slot on the first try, the bank will still register a deposit. This will throw the total off. Again, a manual adjustment can be made (but only if you are aware that there was a problem in the first place)."
2,Bill feeder does not work,"This would be a wonderful learning toy, however, there have been some flaws. If there are too many bills in the bank, it gets jammed and won't accept any more bills. After only a few months, the bill feeder on ours would not accept any bills and just made a horrible grinding noise. We bought another one and the bill feeder broke after only a few uses. It was such a disappointment because this could have been a really cool and fun learning toy."
3,Not a very safe bank.,"My 8 year old son has a blast depositing his money and knowing his balance at all times. However the vault door opens easily, even if you put your nail throught the slot and pull. My son doesn't feel his money is safe with his brother around."
1,very upsetting,"i ordered the item 3 different times and still have never received the correct itme. My son, which is the most dissippointing, still has not received the item he so much wanted. so my experience has not been very good."
4,YOUniverse Deluxe ATM Bank Machine,"I looked at the reviews before I bought this product, and knew it was a 50-50 chance mine would not be broken. I received this product and my 7-yr daughter loves it. I keep it out of her way since our house is small and she puts her savings in it. It's actually helped her to save a little bit of money. She loves it. I think it was a good buy as well. When we are finished and take the card out it sounds like the battery was running down, and it's kind of loud, and it doesn't take old bills. We are satisfied, but would really say for others to order them on the basis of getting one that works or doesn't break 50% of the time. Good luck with yours."
5,"ATM, Savings, Fun",I think that this is definitly a fun way for kids like me to learn how to save money and learn how to take out money and put it in. It is easier for me to save money and fun to put it in becuase it is like your own ATM machine at your own house! For kids 10 and over should use it to save and the next thing you know you have over 20 dollars. For kids 9 and under should get a better understanding on how to save their money and keep it in a safe place. Well all i can say is that this toy is something that i enjoy and hope fully you will too! Remember that saving money should always be something fun and this toy helped a lot!
1,Piece of junk,"I got this for christmas hoping that it would help me better organize my money. I opened up the box, and tried to feed a bill through. It wouldn't work unless the bill was brand (and I mean brand) new. Also, it doesn't even recognize the bill amount, and you have to enter the bill amount. The coin slot can be difficult to push coins through. When inside the machine, the money is not organized in any way, so all your money is mixed together in a large compartment. I would at least expect the coins and bills to be separate. Finally, when you withdraw money, you have to count the money yourself, and enter the amount you took out. If you make a mistake, your whole balance is messed up. With all the technology out there, somebody could've taken a little extra time and effort to make this a better product."
2,grandmother,gave toy as gift to grandson(6 yrs. old). Grandson very disappointed. The balance on the machine does't work. Couldn't get it to function. Was not clear/full. [...]
1,MN,"First of the volume is so loud the function of this toys is bad. I have to say this is first toy I have ever bought that I want to through in the trash. You can enter a deposit but the bottom draw doesn't open, there's no volume control, the function of this toy offers only three options."
5,Best Bank Ever!,First I would like to thank you for getting me the bank just in time before Christmas. I waited until the last minute to order it and really didn't expect to get it until after Christmas. My daughter was really excited about it. It will help her keep up with her money and it will give her an incentive to save. One thing to remember about the bank is you have to teach your child to enter withdrawels and deposits or the balance will not be correct. Overall the bank is great we love it! It's a good learning tool for counting money.
2,Great Concept,We loved this when we first got it. Hard to keep up with the total it does not. U can't make deposits and withdrawals and it keep a total. Not good if you want to keep up with more than one account. I assumed my daughters could keep all the money in one bank and it keep a tally of who has what. Not the case. I guess I was wanting more out of this product than what it gave. Not worth it to me.
1,HELP!!!,Can anyone give me detailed instructions for this machine....it didn't come with any and I have an upset child and mother waiting.
1,Not worth the money (or saving for it),"What a disappointment. My son eagerly opened up the box and set up his name and password and that's about as far as he could get before it started dying. After feeding about 5 quarters into it, it stopped registering the amount. Also, the quarters made the coin slot mechanism too large and now won't register the smaller dimes, pennies, etc. I think we'll just go back to the old-style piggy bank for now..."
1,Disappointment,"This was a very disappointing experience. My 9 year old twin girls were very excited a the prospect of this ATM Machine. It really is a glorified calculator on a box. You have to turn a knob to roll the money into the bank and then punch in the amount you put in. We couldn't get the swipe card to identify the password or to give the correct amount of the balance. Before the day was out, we packed it up and had it ready for return. Yet another disappointment! It could not be exchanged for another item and credit could not be given. The only choice was credit to the exact card it was charged on. I didn't want that because I have closed that account out. Now I have TWO ATM MACHINES in my basement!"
5,wonderful product,this is great for me because sometimes i get too much money and it gets harder too count. also somtimes im just a little bit lazy. plus i think this wonderful making is very fun to use thanks summit for making my kind of product!your customer crystal
5,Great Music by Ajay Atul,This music transports to a world of musical delights and uplifts your spirit. It is a must add to your collection.
1,Not for me,"I have natural curly hair and am always looking for products to control the friz and help define the curls. This product is awful. It makes my hair feel coarse and stiff, not at all smooth and silky like some other products I have tried. It also tends to straighten my hair instead of making it curl. I have tried scrunching it ove and over as it dries, but no go. I would not purchase this if you want soft curls. Maybe it is more of a styling mousse - it s not for naturally curly hair unless you don't mind that coarse stiff feel."
1,Zanies,Much cheaper at PetEdge - Only $2.49 Great toy for little non-destructive dogs. I have used these toys for years for our little dog.
3,"Thicker than many, but DON'T MESS UP!!","I read all the other reviews. And it holds true with this one. You have ONE chance to put it on.I lined up everything perfectly and saw waht thought was a tiny bubble. TUned out to be part of my phone. But the process of pulling it back an inch to get out the bubble... that screwed me. Somehow dust flew in. At first it was just 5 tiny specs, but they made bubbles. Then I needed to pull it back and get those 5.... well that results in 15 bubbles and strands. I was pretty pissed. There is no going back, no cleaning.I will probably throw it away.Bottom line, Don't go back in after you apply it."
5,Great Investment,"This box set is well worth the money spent on it. Education is priceless and so is good film-making- the two come together in this awesome collection of Brave New Films newer additions to their collection. The additional DVD with extras has a nice message from producer/director Robert Greenwald who explains where his vision came from and how they were able to accomplish their goals. It's wonderful insight into the movies, Greenwald, and the Brave New Films organization. I highly recommend this box set (and The Robert Greenwald Documentary Collection) to every American and everyone in the world. Happy viewing!!!"
4,Funny movie,"It wandered a bit there in the middle, but it came back around. Lots of laughs & I liked the premise behind it"
4,All's Faire and Funny!,"I heard a lot of bad reviews on this movie, but because it was filmed at my local ren fest I just had to watch it. Honestly I thought it was very funny and rather enjoyable to watch! I now know that I will buy it as soon as I find it on DVD. Not to mention Hob The Troll is in it more than once and even got to have a speaking line in it LOL!"
4,Good phone with unique feature combinations,"There may be better cordless phones but this had the right combo of required features that were hard to match in other products - it supports 2 lines, caller ID, has an alert light for phone company voicemail, had a keypad on both the base and the handset, speakerphone, etc. Also, it uses 2.4Ghz channel 1 and to date it hasn't conflicted with my two 802.11 Wi-Fi network access points running on channels 6 and 11.The main annoyance so far is a loud clicking sound on the handset earpiece when a call comes in on the other line, even with the alternate line ringer turned off. If you get freequent calls on a secondary line that might be a consideration."
2,A good phone is hard to find,I spend around 90 bucks for this phone at staples for my small home based business. At first it seems to have a lot of neat features but falls short when it comes to call quality. I have friends with $15 v-tech phones that sound better than this! There is static on the line and the tones for the buttons are so loud they'll blow your eardrums out while the voice tones stay too quite to hear. They are both on the same speaker so you can't adjust them independently. I suggest AT&T go back to the drawing board on this one. If I was going to spend $70-$90 on a phone again I would definately not buy this one. I think I will have to resort to buying a much more expensive phone to get the quality needed for a business phone although I've heard that even at $500 there's a lack of call quality. I may be switching to a VOIP system anyway so maybe I'll have better luck in that market.
2,Misrepresented,"One thing promised in this video is how to deal with multiple opponents. NOTHING relating to that topic is mentioned, at all. The cue-card reading is obvious - and she doesn't even do that good a job at it. Some of the techniques may be useful, particularly the grip variants. The one thing that might be of more use than the video itself regarding the purchase is the included written manual, or link therin.Since I purchased the item.. let me share.[...]The insulting part is that the clips in the intro where she is fighting multiple opponents are not included in the content. There are no notes on shieldwork or weapons other than a sword - the latter, I grant might have been a bit much to hope for.All in all, I will look on youtube and refer to the manual rather than depend solely on the video. By itself, of limited use. Used with other materials, might be a moderately useful supplement."
2,Do yourself a favor and go learn from boffer groups,"This DVD is a joke. They have some sex kitten actress who had no bloody idea what she is talking about reading a script. The only thing good about it is that she is good looking and is dressed in fantasy armor.Whoever wrote this does not know how to battle, nor has any concept of combat. Half the things 'taught' in this DVD are common sense,the other half is the actress flubbing her lines.If you really want to learn how to sword fight, just go to a group and say ""Hi I'm new. Can someone teach me?"""
1,A ripoff,"For a DVD touting to teach you ""all the combat skills necessary for you to understand exactly how to defeat your opponents easily in Boffer Sword combat,"" this DVD totally misses the mark.Instead, you are treated to bad editing and spotty sound quality as the the girl pictured on the cover butchers a poorly written script that she reads straight from cue cards, interspersed with ""demonstrations"" that are so grossly exaggerated that you can't garner any idea of how to execute the moves in an actual LARP fight. The information presented barely even qualifies as Boffer Fighting 101 material, much less anything that will help you against even a semi-skilled opponent.Don't waste your time or money with this. Instead, hit up YouTube and look up the numerous SKBC videos to learn some real Boffer Fighting skills."
2,a generous 2 stars for a very young Angie Dickinson,"At 74 minutes this late 50's B western is still amazingly bloated with too much ...of nothing. This could have been cut down to 50minutes and played on TV and still would have been cliche riddled and boring but acceptable. James Arness is pretty wooden...the villians and plot are a complete cliche and the ONLY reason to watch is to see ""and introducing Angie Dickinson"" who out acts everyone else in the movie. The Director Andrew Mclaglen, developed into a pretty good one and that was one of the reasons I gave this a try. Save your 10 bucks and put it towards a Rawhide season set or even a Gunsmoke if that's your taste...this isn't worth your time.I rarely write negative reviews...but I figure there are many out there like me curious because of the talent level and being a John Wayne production ...but its truly B or C level."
4,Gun the Man Down,"Above average western. If you are a James Arness fan, as I am, you will find this movie mildly entertaining. Beautiful Angie Dickenson, in her film debut, gives an above average performance. Cast contains several fine character actors familiar to TV audiences of the 50's and 60's. A great baby boomer nostalgia piece."
5,Great Review - Textbook Companion,"Should not replace your textbook, but is great for supplement. I decided to take multivariate calculus after not taking a math class for more than 3 years. I read the corresponding chapter in prior to each lecture and got an A in the class. Each chapter takes less than 20 min to read and provided a great introduction with examples for all topics. Helped me understand the class lectures much more thoroughly. I would highly recommend this book."
2,not very helpful,"The book seems to spend more time making lame jokes than actually explaining anything. Also, there are not enough examples and no practice problems."
3,what is all the hoopla?,"Not that there is anything wrong with this book. But I don't understand all the praises on other reviews. This book is not more illuminating than a good standard textbook on calculus, nor did I get any new insight into calculus. I think one will gain more by sticking to a GOOD standard calculus textbook. I recommend Anton, Stewart, Swokowski, Ellis, or Loomis. But if you are having a trouble with those books, perhaps this book would be a gentler start, but it will not give you a new perspective."
2,umm... what can i say,"this book is a piece of crap. i bought it cos i was confused of my textbook, but now i'm getting even more confuse after reading it"
4,"This is great for Calc II, III, and Engineering Mathematics.","I am a mathematics teacher. I admire this textbook and its predecessor, and have recommended them both many times to my students. They are not a substitute for your textbook, but will help you immensely in your studies."
3,slice not sooo good,"This slicer slices from the bottom up. It pulls the meat right out of your hand when the meat goes past the center of the blade. you have to keep flipping over the meat to get it to cut cleanly off after slicing about 10-12 slices off of a bottom round roast. I had a portable krug slicer(""old"") that worked MUCH Better."
5,Quiet magic,"Story's music might be more accurately described as psychological chamber music. It is intricately composed, well-thought-out, essentially indifferent as to how it might be perceived by the listener. It is music that speaks with a voice all its own: fragile and yet profound. It doesn't care what you may think of it. It exists in its own very personal and intimate space, and it invites you into that space to share in its mystery.Every piece on this album is a finely chiselled work of art. The last two pieces, ""Many Years Pass,"" and ""The Luminous, The Dark"", taken together form one of the most beautiful sequences of music that I've ever heard. The music ends by converging towards a gentle electronic pulse, and then returning into the silence and mystery from which it came, leaving the listener beguiled."
5,Beguiled- haunting and emotionally complex in its simplicity,"Tim Story is at his best in Beguiled - a clarity of sound and sincerity opens up the world of the emotions, and memories of both strength and delicacy float over the top, flood into a foundational underpinning, and weave heartstrings through the middle. Extraordinary revelations unfold with repeated listenings. Your mind will journey out into space and right back to the center of your own heart. One of my very favorite albums."
5,Satisfied,"This is what ""alternative music should be. Very relaxing and stimulating as well. I would highly recommend it to all."
2,Stewed Tomatos,"I just had some over noodles and it looks & tastes like stewed tomatoes w/ large leafs of basil & whole clove sections of garlic? i kinda wanted more of a ""spaghetti sauce"" not stewed tomatoes."
4,"Good encompassing book, good variety of tracks","I used this book for a beginners music class and I was happy the way they explained the basic concepts and how they laid them out by chapter. The tracks involved a good variety of music in the world(duh the title) and had some good tid bits of information concerning history, art, influence etc.book didn't come with tracks but I still got it for a good price, and more importantly I learned about music and I wasn't bored while doing it(except for the extremely long concertos, sonatas etc.)"
2,Should clearly state not included soundtrack disc,"how come a brand new book without the two CD, i am really mad now."
2,Support Bars are a pain,"I love the design and durability of the crate. However, the crate requires you to insert the two support bars at the top of the crate to prevent it from collapsing inward. You have to insert one end and push in the bar and stretch the canvas of the crate to get the bar to fit into the other end. This is a pain especially if you are a weakling.[...]Other soft sided folding crates have a better designed folding mechanism. I would pay a bit extra and get one of these types of crates instead."
4,great travel crate,"This seems to be a well made crate, tough material etc. It is harder to set up than some more expensive brands, but since I leave it open most of the time it works great for me. I use it in my car, for transport to and from dog classes. At class it is easy to just carry back and forth if needed. Would definitely buy it again."
2,I should of known better,I should of spent more time looking and maybe a little more money for a better set. The problem i have is after 4 rounds of golf the irons are all beat up. I will admit that i am just starting but due to this i should of invested into something a little more sturdy.
1,Why,"I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. After I ordered this book I couldn't wait to get it, as soon as I got it I tore the packaging off, sat down and got comfortable, man I thought this book will be good. It wasn't, it seems the author is so busy describing their thoughts and feelings that the characters don't seem to speak for themselves. The characters don't make you feel anything, it's almost like reading an essay about them. In all honesty I read straight through 200 pages then I skipped here and there because I was bored. Mabey I'm not giving a fair opinion, but it's mine, so do with it what you will."
4,greattt book ( NOT MY REAL NAME),I REALLLY LIKE THIS BOOK AND THE CHARACTERS. I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS ROMANTIC AND FELT THE LOVE BETWEEN BOTH CHARACTERS. THE STORY LINE WAS INTERESTING. I LIKE THE FACT NICHOLAS WAS KIND AND LOVING PERSON. I DID NOT LIKE HIS MOTHER.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY ONE WHO WANTS TO READ IT.AFTER READING THIS BOOK..I JUST WANTED IT TO GO ON AND ON ABOUT THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN.I WILL READ AGAING IN THE FUTURE A SECOND TIME.YOU JUST FEEL THE LOVE AND ROMANCE IN THIS BOOK AND THE HAPPY ENDING BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS
2,Twist?,"So, I am not a avidSo, I am not as avid about the book just being horrible as some of the one star commenters. However, I do agree that the book just didn't flow for me. For some reason the idea of men who want to jump head first into a complicated relationship and play whatever role should come along, doesn't read well. I prefer there be hesitation on both ends. Not to mention I knew exactly why his mother had the issues she had with him falling in love with a black woman, long before the book begins to cover her issues. Now, as a fan of just having the Indigo Love Spectrum books I want the publishers to stay in business, but this was not one of my favorite versions of Black girl meets White boy."
4,Love in the making,"this book has it up and downs...so the beginning both characters were fighting fire and it seemed as though they never wanted a connection in the first place but as the story continues you discover secrets unknown to anyone and looks*can be deceiving!definitely a good read, please get this book"
2,Poorly written...,"First of all I am wondering if the author even bothered to get this book edited. It had sooooo many grammatical errors it was ridiculous! Run on sentences, fragments, incomplete sentences, broken sentences and other stuff that was overlooked in the editing process if there WAS an editing process. The story line was very cheesy. She basically took one under developed story line and dragged it out for about 28 chapters. Some of the things said were soooo repetitive I found myself thinking ""gosh can we finally ever move on to the next part of the story?"". Anyway, I was still able to read the book and be satisfied with the ending though. I am a crazy hopeless romantic at heart so I thought it was cool when it ended although it was extremely predictable. Anyway overall I would not recommend this book to a friend, but I believe whether you like it or not is all about perception and what you personally like. Just because I thought it was somewhat crappy doesn't mean you will."
2,"Cute love story, not very realistic...","The love story that the book was centered around was cute but because the book had too many unrealistic events, it was just okay to me. No way, ever, would two people meet under the written circumstances and even if they did, do you really believe that they would fall in love and live happily ever after? This was my first book by this author and I have to admit that it was written well. I believe that she has the potential to write and excellent book if she had a good story. Just okay for me, no need to buy, BORROW!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,WHITE MALE-BLACK FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS IN AND OF THEMSELVES ARE EXTREMELY RARE. RARER STILL IS WHEN THE MALE IS WEALTHY AND THE FEMALE IS OF MODEST MEANS. THIS READER FEELS LIKE HER INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN INSULTED. AND SINCE WHEN DOES THE OPINION OF OTHERS (SUCH AS THAT OF NICHOLAS'S MOTHER) EVER STOP A PERSON TRULY IN LOVE FROM PURSUING A RELATIONSHIP? THE FERTILITY CLINIC SCENARIO MADE AN ALREADY UNREALISTIC PLOT EVEN SILLIER. WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!
4,"Good Read, Not Typical IR Book","I enjoyed reading this book. This is a BW/WM story and unlike it's follow-up Beyond the Rapture.I thought that the situation was very believable (mix-ups do happen at fertility clinics) and I loved the fact that the 2 main characters did not dwell on race as a central obstacle. The editor did a good job, and the typos were very few and far between.Like most healthy relationships, their love focused on a mutual attraction and the reasons for that attraction. The sex scenes were good but not lewd and the length of the book made it worth the price.The main characters were sympathetic, kind, and sensitive to each other's needs and their families. Plus I wasn't left pulling my hair out screaming at the lead female character for being stubborn and hard-headed.I highly recommend this book!"
1,Save Your Money,"This is my first time reading an interracial love story, but I read a lot of books. This author's writing skills are horrible in that: there are no depths to her characters, I've read better dialogue on a cereal box, the amount of punctuation errors to name a few. I felt as though I were reading a script from a play, not a story. Is this writer fresh out of an eighth grade writing course? Don't buy this book!"
4,Interesting Concept,"An interesting twist to the typical romance novel with the issue of a mistake at a fertility clinic resulting in Camille (black) carrying the child of Nicholas (white...maybe) rather than that of her dead husband. The author dealt well with the fallout from that mix-up leading to love between Camille and Nicholas. This book did not get 5 stars because I felt the reactions by Renee's brother Jamal and Nicholas's mother were a bit extreme, despite the mother's secret about her true identity."
4,A twist of fate,"The characters were poorly developed, and the story was too one dimensional. None of Camille's family was ever properly introduced, and the story about Nicholas's mother was way out there to be considered belivable. I enjoyed the actual story though, and for some reason I was able to get into this book despite the lack of character development. I did too notice the book's errors and the whole book structure was just awful, but like I said, to my surprise I liked this book."
1,It happned to fast,"This story devolped way to fast. Nick and Cammy go from hating each other to falling madly in lust in what seems like days. They meet at a spermbank (what is the made in America two?) She's got his kid's there for he's her ""babydaddy"" They fight. I want the kids. No I want the kid. Her bother dislike him.Oh snaps He's white (what is this 1950). Her mother is on the fence. Hey it could be worse. His mother dislike them. Find a nice white girl. Then something changes??? They love each other. Oh I love you I love you I love you. Did I mention I'm rich. Oh you are. Yes I am. They ride of into the sunset with twins. I love our kids lover. Hey I love em too. Read this one by a trashcan cuz you feel the urge to vomit ."
4,On the Money,"Flash Cards Money is one of a number of Hot Dots materials we use at our learning center. It adds another option to our workbooks and manipulatives. Students like the instant feedback the Hot Dots system provides as well as the sounds, speech , and flashing lights of the Hot Dots pen.The cards provide a variety of practice with different kinds of problems presented on the cards. We like that each side of the card presents a different money problem. The images of coins and bills on the cards are photographic, much more effective than monetary sketches.Students enjoy using these cards; they can be used by themselves or in conjuction with real coins and bills to teach money concepts. I think the price for the set of cards and the Hot Dots pen (sold separately) is reasonable.Keep extra batteries on hand for the pen."
4,"A great book, but there are better Sweet Valley books.",This book was above average. I like how Elizabeth and Jessica get mad at each other before they get fired and how their worst fight gets shown as the great commercial.
4,Paradise,"Kiki Deni's book is a solid literary work for scholars of the Mediterranean pride-, honor-, shame-, blood-, kinship-, and gender- notions. It locates the ""unbearable lightness of being"" in soft touches and promises; heavy consciences and losses. The writer's Edenic wanderings are diachronic: it is only at the end we realize that the last day is, indeed, the first day of paradise."
5,The new My Fat Greek Wedding,"Great parallel plots. A very refreshing, original book about relationships given in a humorous way; highly recommend it. Very theatrical, felt I was watching the 'My Fat Greek wedding' all overagain."
2,not bad for the first book,The language is over-simplifiedand repetitive. No sophisticated and/or between-line images.It gave me a general disappointment about current generation's interests and world outlook. Not bad for the first book though...
4,The Last Day of Paradise,"Strongly hilarious and witty. I had great anecdotal empathy for Kiriaki, since I come from a similarly dysfuctional Greek background. Yet, Greek or not, one can relate to this book. An excellent read."
4,"Resonably priced solution, easy to install","This is an adjustable Carlon box with a special floor receptacle cover with doors that cover the receptacle when not in use.Following the instructions, I had no problems installing the boxes in the new construction, and can see no reason why there would be any problems installing them in existing floors."
4,Wedding Cakes Magazine,"Great for ideas, modern views and to know what is new on the cake decorating business, very happy with my purchased"
4,music to disappear in,This cd is wonderful. I use this during morning meditation time. I was already aware of the songs as I had an old copy on tape. Was glad to get a new copy on cd.
5,Relaxing,If you don't want to be relaxed don't listen to this CD! It's a wonderful prescription for the spirit.
4,Whistle,"I didn't think that this horn sounded as real as I thought it would. It installed very easily though, and it was inexpensive."
4,a lucid depiction of life's bitter reality,Amid the common presumptuous indulgence to paris's irresistable romanic aroma this book delivers the bitter reality of life. A book that engulfs many existing but hidden dilemma in the city of love that many of us are just unaware of. A good read but not something that will lift your christmas spirit.
4,My teenage girls had to have a movie wth The Rock AND Josh Hutcherson . . .,"Suspend your sense of reality to enjoy the imaginitive follow-up to Journey 1. I thought I'd miss Brendan Frazier from the first movie, but I didn't. Plenty of family-friendly adventure and goofy humor."
3,Journey 2 good not great.,"This movie was entertaining and enjoyable while the special effects were also good, not great. Many movies these days have really raised the bar defining great special effects. This production was good, not great."
3,Journey 2 Review,"I think the synopsis that I read before I purchased the movie gave an adequate summary of what to expect when I watched the movie. The movie made an attempt at not being to predictable and the same as Journey to the Center of Earth. The interatction between Dewayne Johnson's character and the other characters were comically entertaining. There were some great one liners and Dewayne Johnson even sings!!! The action was not as good as the Journey to the Center of the Earth. But overall, it was a good family movie to watch because it showcased the difficulties a man maight face trying to fulfil the role of stepfather to a teenage son."
3,It's ok,"For a kid movie it was ok, Hollywood is just not original anymore. But for a PG movie I can't complain."
4,Fun Movie!,"It's crazy but I like Dwayne Johnson in movies. This was a fun movie and the kids really like it. The ""Rock"" needs to make some more action flicks soon!"
3,Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"Though I believe this to be a good movie, it is not great. It had plenty of action, as expected, but did not measure up to it's previous Journey to the Center of the Earth. Some scenes were so rediculous it made me laugh. A good family film, but not as good as the first."
3,good 3d movie just ok,The 3d in this movie was pretty good but the story line was definitely lacking and we love the Rock! better luck next time.
3,more for kids,Just a little disappointed thought it would be better? More for kids than adults.3d was good though. I would reccomend it for people with kidsED
4,good movie not a great movie,"I expected more of a adventure,and less of a flower garden. Me personal I like journey1, I watched this movie in 3D there were some pretty good pop out scenes my favorite was Dwayne Johnson had those cherries popping off his chest right into the viewer face. how cool was that?"
5,great movie,a good movie great kid film funny for the whole family the rock does a great job in his rolethe background shots are amazing
3,OK,"I really don't remember much about the movie. Just that it's ok for a kid's movie. Kinda juvenile, but fun."
4,Fun Movie. Dwayne Johnson doesn't disapoint.,A fund adventure that is appropiate for the whole family. Dwayne Johnson was funny and the plot while not overly complicated was good enough to keep the adults and kids watching both interested.
3,It's just OKAY,"I'm a movie buff. I have watched and seen about every kind of movie old or new there is. This movie is PG, and so I way predicted everything that would pretty much happen before it happen. I kind of liked the first movie, and so I gave this a shot. It's pretty much the same thing, but now there a extra love interest threw into the mix. It's not really exciting but NOT boring either. It just okay.You don't need to watch the first movie to watch this movie. There's no back story to it at all. All there is that connect these two movie is the boy, Sean. He is in both movie, the end.So, if you're looking for a family filled fun movie, this is it! Otherwise, you might get pretty bored with this one and you can pass on it."
2,Okay....,"Dwayne Johnson needs to stick with action movies -- with the exception of the Pacifier. That was a good movie. This one is more for the kids, IMHO."
3,Average movie,"They mixed a lot of humor into this story. Personally that detracts from an action/adventure movie imo. The acting was great, the story line was decent."
2,"Great if you're under 10- if not, beware!","On my recent lengthy plane trip I had time to watch a few movies, so I took a look at this one. I gave it a fair chance, but couldn't get to the end of it.It's been a long time (55 years, to be precise) since I was under 10 years old. Were I that age now, I think I might have found this movie entertaining. However, as a 64-year old, although I still love sci/fantasy movies, they have to have more going for them than Dwayne Johnson's ability to bounce cherries off his pecs. The dialog is beyond awful, the acting is perfunctory and even the special effects are unconvincing. Michael Caine proves yet again that, as a working actor, he will take any part offered to him; I'm never really sure whether to applaud his lack of pretentiousness or bemoan his lack of discrimination.On the plus side, this movie is fine for any age (provided it's under 10) and it's good clean fun. Buy it for your kids or grandkids. Don't watch it yourself."
3,It was worth seeing once...,I don't think I would watch it again although it was entertaining. A bit campy but worth the price of the rental.
3,Journey 2,It was a good movie but not as good as the first Journey. He could have left out the scene where he flexed his muscles to get the girl.
2,Save Your Money,"Ordered this movie based on other viewers comments. Plot, 3d,& visual effects were terrible. The only thing worse was theacting. Waste of money!!!!"
1,Mysterious Island why was it made?,I sat through this painful movie with the realization is was just going to be one of those movies made for the box office hype but no real substance. Sorry to see actors involved in such horrible scripts.
2,"Pretty, but so boring","This movie was like looking at a painting for a couple hours. Yes, it was pretty, but it was so boring. There was no suspense, limited humor and the kids we rented it for could not stay awake to finish it because it just dragged. They also did not ask for a replay, which is very unusual for them. I might have given it a 3, but I am surprised it has such a high rating and I am hoping to save other people the time and money we wasted.You would be better off rewatching the first film, rather than trying to make it through this sequel."
2,Journey 2 boredom,"Oh dear God. This takes 3 books with islands (Gulliver's Travels, Treaure Island & Mysterious Island) bastardizes them, makes up things as it goes along and is just so awful I can't begin to describe it. Totally unbelievable. Probably okay for 8 years olds but doubful they'll get the references to the great books this molests. But maybe they'll read them?"
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this movie in the theatre. It's pacing is nice and it's very easy to watch. It's definitely more tailored for kids as it tends to feel like it was written by a 12 year old at times. Everything is very predictable and obvious but like I said, I had a nice time watching it and if your in the mood for a non-thinking fun movie this is the one for you."
4,journey 2 the mysterious island.,Funny! Good kids movie. You can never go wrong when watching a Dwayne the rock Johnson movie. Hope you like it.
1,Extremely poor standard def quality-very pixilated,"Straming quality on the non-hd version is extremely poor and, although free under amazon prime, not worth it for the viewing experience."
3,Figured out some of the story but it was fun!!!,"Ok, so since I really liked Journey to the Center of the Earth and Mysterious Island was only $1.99 I thought what the heck.It was fun, Dwayne is cool and funny, Michael Caine is a kick, and the action and visuals were awesome. I figured out that the city was Atlantis pretty quickly but the way they combined multiple literary classics and blended them so well it was a fast paced, clever ride. This is perfect for all ages!"
4,Fun- for Family Movie Nights!,"Not as good as the first, in our opinion. But a decent sequel, with another love story twist. Predictable but- Cute movie for Family Movie night!"
3,Entertainment,"Not a bad movie, but not one I would suggest spending money on. Wait for a free streaming download. Entertainment when your bored."
3,OK,"This movie is just ok. It's nothing special, nothing horrible. My kids saw the first one and they thought the previews for the second looked good."
3,Movie was OK.,Not the best movie I have seen but The Rock was good and the special effects were good. Price was right and it was timelyreceived.
4,The Grandkids like this a lot,Our Grandkids & Pre teen grandchildren really enjoyed this movie . We did as well great family fun movie for the whole family
4,You have to like corn,"This movie is very entertaining, if you like childish sight gags and corny dialogue. As it happens, I do and so do the kids. This is definitely for kids and kids-at-heart. The 3D is acceptable with good depth and great colors. Definitely a popcorn movie."
1,movie review,I hate to give this a low rating. The movie was good but the quality that streamed was awful. The picture was horrible for most of the movie. I have high speed Internet and have never had problems when watching netfix so I don't understand why this was so bad. We have tried to watch other amazon programing with mixed results. I will be sticking with directv or netflix from now on.
4,Fun family film,The movie was a fun little family film with a few name stars. Not in the same league as a major sci-Fi film but was a perfect family film.
4,Entertaining,"If I could, I'd probably give it 3 & 1/2 stars. I liked the film.. it definitely had some funny moments. It didn't really show that much.. small elephants, big lizards and bees, and small sharks near the end... would've liked to of seen more creative animals in the movie. Enjoyed watching it.. probably wouldn't watch a 2nd time though. Good to rent."
4,Fun,I am older but I thoroughly enjoyed this video. It was fun and fast paced and had a pretty good plot. A fun hour or so for all ages.
4,Nice Movie,This was a fun movie. We didn't even know that Vanessa Hudgeons was in it so was pleasantly surprised to see her pop up. The movie was fun & entertaining.
1,Service,I ordered this movie in 3D and waited with baited breath just for this movie and you people couldn't even send the damn movie in 3D and it was the only movie that I really wanted. You sent the other movie in 3D but I could care less about that one.So thanks a whole helluva lot.
1,appalling cheesy cliched drivel,"The title of this review sums it up. Every line deleivered, every plot idea, every character was SO stereotyped I couldnt believe it. This film is cardboard cutouts on an incerdibly cheap backdrop. The 'monsters' are laughable, simple being blown-up normal animals. I would go on but the longer 1 star review captured it all. terbbile, terrible film."
4,Fun,This movie was better than I thought it would be. It was fun and entertaining. I enjoyed the character interaction and friendships that evolved throughout the movie.
4,Journey,"Movie is mainly for the kids, which is why my son enjoys watching it over and over again. The movie is decent for adults, funny when it needs to be, and keeps you entertained."
4,silly but fun,"this is not like the book and isnt as good as first movie, but its a great fun time for families."
3,"Where is ""Daffy' Rhapsody""?","It was at the theatre with this movie, but what happened to the ""Daffy's Rhapsody"" short? Why so cheap Warner Brothers? If the short was included, this blu ray would have been purchased immediately, but no short, no sale."
4,A good family adventure.,"A teenage boy, who has a strained relationship with his stepfather, is determined to go on a trip to find a mystery island from a Jules Verne novel. The Stepfather agrees to accompany him on the trip, where they are joined by a helicopter pilot and his beautiful daughter. The highlights of this one, apart from the amazing visuals, are the personalities present. The Rock is one of the biggest personalities in movies today. He is naturally funny and is always enjoyable to watch. Luis Guzman also brings quite a few laughs to this film, as the onscreen chemistry of all is very good. The 3D effect here is terrific, and this is a fun, funny, and exciting early year treat for the whole family."
3,Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"This movie wasn't bad for being a sequal. It was a little rushed in the plot and general progression of the movie, but had good CGI and special effects."
5,Journey 2,Great movie. Upgrading my movie collection to Blu-ray. Big differance from dvd. Picture quality as well as sound as amazing
3,Journey 2: Mysterious Island,"Good movie, good acting, but moved to quickly (i.e., needed better action scenes and scenes that weren't so predictable) and didn't keep me glued to my seat."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie,"Since 3D DVDs are very limited and a lot of them are animated, which I don't really much care for. I bought this movie to try on my new 3D TV. The movie was loosely based on a Jules Vern story and it was quit interesting. The way the story is told is completely different from any version of Mysterious Island that I've seen in the past. The 3D effects were superb."
3,Journey 2 3D review,"I mainly rate on the 3D quality and not the movie. The picture quality is beautiful and the island itself is awesome looking. The 3D is ok in this movie, nothing to run and tell people about. I was really expecting to see a lot of exploding out of the screen 3D, but I did not have that much of an experience like the first Journey movie.. The highest ratio of 3D in this movie is the Rock part with popping the berries off his chest and a couple more under water scenes came out a little. Other than that, I would say the 3D is far from being better than the first movie. Overall just ok with the exception of me being a rock fan.. I could have still been ok with the regular blue ray version. If you want an amazing 3D explosion buy the first in 3D.."
2,"Good animated movie, but not much for 3D...","Good movie but not as great as 1st one...1st movie certainly is impressive but as they say, its hard to have a great sequel..In this case thats exactly what happened...If you are looking for as great 3d effects as first one, you will be disappointed, good humor having The Rock Dwayne Johnson involved, but not worth the sale overall.."
3,Enh....,"I preferred the first one. This didn't quite make it as a family film for me.The story starts off way too fast, there was no mystery or solving anything. ""Oh hey, that's code, want me to read it for you?""The movie really had potential, but I feel like they could have put in a bit more effort. There were several scenes that were clearly made for 3D, which is fine, but when you sacrifice a good chunk of time to include nonsense story telling and offer eye candy... you're not improving the film.Please don't ""Journey 3 the Moon"". I would hate to see this series get that bad."
3,Mysterious Island,"I like Dwayne Johnson this is also a good movie for kids to watch, the 3D was not the best I've seen"
3,It's OK,This fell short of my expectations. The Rock should have stuck with The Scorpion King franchise and left this train wreck alone. The grandkids liked it and that's all that matters because it won't be coming off the shelf when they're not here. It has tired and lame antics from start to finish and I really thought it could have been written and directed better.
1,Bad Quality,Hey amazon! I want my money back. The pixels are the size of a postage stamp. A Cam would have been better. 4.99 for poor quality! I want my money back!!!!!
1,Awful boring = Awful story which is boring,Rent or buy another movie. You have been sufficiently warned. I expected far more and wanted to end the movie after the first 15 minutes.
3,Mystery Island,"A great cast, but with some fairly lame story lines. Almost a tired writer coming up with a creenplay on a short schedule in a rush for completion. The actors were simply on auto-pilot with nothing to sink their teeth into. I know it was not meant to be a drama, but a bit of over kill on the comedic attempts. Dwayne Johnson is still a great action actor, but this one was not a great effort on his part. Great special effects helped this one out of the dog house."
3,3D would have been better,The movies was good. The 3D would have been better. But I got to watch The Rock so all was not lost. It was a pretty fast paced quick movie. It could have been longer in my opinion.
5,As expected!,"Love the packaging, very well done. Movie is in great condition. Can't wait to watch tonight after I play my game I also got in today! Thank you. Fast, and accurate delivery."
4,Extremely disappointed in the Ultraviolet Digital Bluray,"I have been trying for days to get Ultraviolet digital copy to work without success! I have sent three messages to Ultraviolet with no response. I send a message to Flixster and they refer me to Ultraviolet. I don't think I will buy another Ultraviolet Digital copy again. I was about to preorder ""Avengers"" digital combo but I am going to wait until I know what type of digital copy it will be.Despite being unhappy about losing out on the digtial copy, I did like the movie very much. It was a fun adventure for family night."
4,Miss Julia And The Hogs,"Miss Julia again comes through for her friends when they need her.Most of us ladies realize that our maids are our best friends and we don't want them mistreated. And what Miss Julia goes through to defend the underdog! And her friends rise to the occasion or should I say ride. It's a whole new experience for the intrepid lady and those she takes along. Another breathtaking ending, and I think I see a love story coming as the sequal because Sam is smitten !"
5,Always a joy!,"Always a joy to read about Miss Julia and this book is no different. Always up to something she is, but she perceivers and carries on in life's difficult moments with style and grace! I always look forward to curling up to a book with Miss Julia and all our gang!"
3,Okay filler,"The phallic jokes were kind of jr high to me. However, I liked that Miss Julia was encouraging the pastor's wife to defy her husband, and have some fun."
1,Hackneyed tripe,"Although Miss Julia is not bigoted, her creator is. I hated the way the maid's speech was rendered in Step-n-fetch-it dialog while Miss Julia, who surely has a heavy Southern accent, is depicted as speaking standard English. The character of the maid is also trite. She could have stepped straight out of Gone With the Wind.I may have disliked the book because I dislike Miss Julia, who is prissy, prickly and acts with the unthinking arrogance of someone born at the top of a very small social heap."
2,Disappointment,"Miss Julia has always been a light hearted comedy/mystery series. As an African-American I found this episode of the Miss Julia adventures offensive. The African-American housekeeper Lillian and her neighbors were portrayed as too ignorant to believe. If I had not received this book free of charge, I would have asked for my money back. Never again will I read a Miss Julia book."
4,"Works well, with a little modification","This ""Decora"" style X10-compatible dimmer/switch features the extended dimming function. Tapping the switch will alternate between OFF and the last-set dim level. To set the dim level, hold the switch in until the desired level is reached.After an easy install, the mechanical operation of the switch was unacceptable. All it took to operate the switch was the LIGHTEST brush against it, not even an intentional press... I mean I probably could have actuated it by breathing on it. To remedy, I removed the plastic switch paddle and Dremeled the back of it for 20 minutes until I ground enough plastic away to ensure it took an intentional press to actuate.I have another one of these units, and I'll post my experience with that one [if I can], after installation.After modification, the dimmer switch performed well.The device comes with white and ivory pieces, so you can choose your color."
2,Disappointing Read!!,"When I bought this book, I thought I was going to learn how the Kabbalah could help me tackle some long-term health concerns I have had. To my disappointment, this book makes it hard to even want to keep reading. The book is more of an autobiography of the author and his experiences with kabbalistic wisdom than a book about using the kabbalah to heal yourself. There are much better books out there about the kabbalah. I would recommend you pass on this one."
4,Excellent Cajun Dancehall Music,"Few Cajun musicians were as hard playing and hard living as Austin Pitre. A central figure in the accordian revival of the post-war period, little of Pitre's work is available on CD. (The exception being Swallow disc he shares with D. L. Menard.) Pitre was popular on the local dancehall scene and his music has a loud, brash sound that strongly represents that environment. These sides were recorded at Pitre's home and at a dance and show an artist at full power. A welcome reissue of an artist we have too few recordings by. The sound is very good considering that some of these were recorded at a live dance."
2,Ehhh.,"This novel was technically well-written, and superficially entertaining, but completely one-dimensional. Women were reduced to sex-starved, hysterical characters at the mercy and whim of men. Men were portrayed with exaggerated bravado and near-disgusting machismo. I tried hard to like it, but found it difficult to enjoy this portrayal of single-sided relationships and simplistic characters."
2,A promising starts sinks under the weight of melodrama,I absolutely loved the first 100 pages of this novel. But all too soon it starts to sink under the weight of its near-hysteria melodrama. The loves scenes are overwritten and the dialogue too arch--people don't talk like this. Hrbek needed to pare down on the purple prose in order to have saved this one.
4,"I'm proud of you, Greg!","Great book. Brutally honest, as it should be, and very well written. Greg-I've met you before- we were classmates in Jessica Hagedorn's Writer's Voice classes in New York, in Spring 1993. I had the small-town Texas pieces, and you were reading from the Hindenburg manuscript even back then- and we all loved it. You did a great job with it and got it published. Bravo!"
5,Great little knife,I bought this item mainly to just open packaging and boxes at work and it is thin and small enough to carry around. It is also durable and sharp enough to meet all my needs and be there when I need it to cut through a little more durable material.
4,Very Thin Pocket Knife,"I wanted a pocket knife that I could carry on a daily basis without really feeling it in my pocket. I also wanted a quality piece that would last a while. This knife DOES NOT have a pocket clip, which I think is good, because it keeps the whole thing thin and minimal.As the dimensions indicate, it's a small knife. The edge is okay, not super sharp, but plenty sharp for basic needs. It has a quality feel to the way it opens and closes, and the lock is secure.The only possible con is that the blade is pretty thin. If I use it recklessly, I could probably bend or break the blade. But heavy stuff is not the point of this kind of knife."
4,Tiny little knife,"I don't know why I bought this tiny little knife. it would make an excellent keychain if I didn't go to so many places where even this knife is not permitted. you can't easily open it with one hand, but that's a result of a singular focus on making this thing as small and compact as possible. I really like this knife, I just can't find a place to use it that a bigger knife isn't as good or better."
5,Pocket knife,This is an outstanding pocket knife. It keeps its edge sharp and handy to open packages and break down cardboard boxes.
5,amazing small knife,This knife was very nice it was a little bit small but I absolutely love it I work at a grocery store therefore I'm always opening boxes and this knife works perfectly if your looking for a knife that's small and tough this is the knife you need it also comes out of the package RAZOR sharp and I'm not kidding it shaved the hair off my arm very excellent knife thanks again gerber.
5,Awesome small knife,"I bought this knife to carry around with me everywhere I go. In Illinois it is illegal to carry a knife with a blade that's 3"" or longer. It fits great in the smallest pocket. It comes sharp,you can even shave with it. It is a little annoying having to pop out the safety in the handle when putting the blade back in but you'll get used to it. Overall, great small knife, you wont regret buying it."
3,Not what I hoped for,"Pros: Lightweight, easily fits in pocket.Cons: Impossible to open one-handed, finish looks ancient after just a few weeks in my pocket, not very sharp as delivered (needs much work to improve edge).Overall a decent product at the price, but I had hoped for something that would open one-handed (and left handed at that), and retain its looks a little longer."
4,Excellent little knife. Sneaky bugger.,"This little knife is great for all utility applications, and is highly concealable if you're into that kind of thing. It can be comfortably opened with one hand, but I find it usually cannot be flicked open unless you loosen it. Note that it has no clip or thumb nob. Excellent little knife.[...]"
3,Nice little knife,"But it's nothing special. Keep it in my bag for emergencies. I didn't realize there was no pocket clip, but that's my fault for not reading the description very well."
5,the perfect pocket knife,"This little jewel is the perfect size for what a person would want a pocket knife for.It is small enough in size not to ""clunk"" around with your pocket change or cell phone, yet handy for those quick little jobs.Very sharp and lightweight."
1,rather get a spyderco,"really bad design not useful at all.... hard to hold, no way to cut any thing nicely... cant cut paper... do not have a good edge"
4,good knife but very easy to lose.,"this little knife is awesome small, strong and very sharp the only con is that its really light and small you dont fell if it fall if it falls out of your pocket i just ordered a second one"
3,"Sharp, small knife but does not close","This light knife is good for cutting. However, contrary to the packaging, it either cannot be closed or is very difficult to close. There is no obvious way to unlock it."
2,Good but small,This knife look large in the picture but it is actually very small. This knife is not practical in many ways because of its small size and the fact that it is very hard to hold.
3,small lightweight,not as durable as i thought it would be. it is a verylight small pocket knife. you dont even know you are carying it.
3,Soooo tiny....,"I bought this to max out a gift card. decent price for a little folder, one I thought would be good for the wife to keep in her purse for miscellaneous use. I knew it would be small, but it was teeny-tiny; my 4-year old pronounced it as such. It isn't much longer than my index finger when open. Nice edge out of the packaging, but too small to be of much use beyond opening mail. Good as a gag-gift, and great for the price."
5,Great pocket knife.,"This knife was exactly what I was looking for, very small, but still sharp and strong. Easy to carry with you anywhere, and tough enough to get the job done. Would definitely recommend as a small utility knife to keep on you whenever your out."
2,"Very small knife, finish scrapes easily, not very sharp","Bought this with the intention of carrying on my keychain - and it's the perfect size for that. Folded up, it's barely larger than a regular house key. It was smaller than I was expecting.The matte black finish chips and scrapes easily, which is very noticeable when it's on your keychain (I imagine the keys are scraping it up). Oh well.In the product description, it says that it's possible to open with one hand. It's not possible to do this safely, the knife is far too small. To fold the knife back up, you need to use your fingernail to get under the lock. It is not an ergonomic or convenient action to fold the knife back up.And the blade isn't very sharp."
2,extremely small knife,"This knife was extremely small and not sharp at all. I actually had to sharpen it myself, which really sucked. The knife was way too small, I thought it would be bigger."
2,"Great, once opened","I have a very difficult time closing this knife. It's nice and sharp, but the release is coated in black, which scrapes against my nail. I don't like the feel of it."
2,disapointing,"I've had several Gerber knives, and thought ""how can I go wrong."" The other knives were very good products, but when this one arrived the finish on the handle was looking a little worn. After the first day of living in my front pocket with a few keys, the knife looked chewed-up. This knife is very thin and light, but Gerber has put a flat black finish on the handle, and it just doesn't hold up. The blade is good; no complaints, yet. The LST is a better knife. I've had several of those, and never had any buyers remorse."
5,Very handy little knife,"I'm a girl with small hands and long finger nails and I figured out a way unhinge it so my nails don't break. Just unhinge it your using the bottom for your top so it buffers your index finger. Very sharp out of the box, and small. For this price I can't complain."
3,much smaller than I expected,fit and finish are fine. could be very functional for a person with smaller hands. For me difficult to manipulate
3,"ok, but like the Kershaw better",I bought this and the Kershaw OD-2 together and carry the little kershaw everyday. The gerber stays at home and barely gets used. you can't open it with one hand. things do get stuck in it. and it gets scratched very easily in the pocket.
2,"Looks cool, but...","I was first interested in this knife because I thought it looked really cool. I liked the black blade and the smaller size. The price wasn't bad either. But I was disappointed with how dull the blade was. I tried sharpening it, but it didn't help much. Basically, I had a cool looking knife that was useless because the blade was too dull. I never carried it and eventually gave it away.In my opinion, you should skip this knife. If you want a smaller knife for under $15, maybe try a Victorinox Bantam or another Swiss Army model. These blades don't lock, but they come much sharper than the Gerber STL."
3,won't puchase it again,"sturdy construction, but difficult to release blade lock. only minor handle curvature and thin handle profile makes it possible to slip fingers to blade in stabbing action. also a tad heavy for comfortable pocketing. still prefer the Gerber LST series for everyday pocket knife."
4,"A Great item,Just didnt come with any instructions","This item is great it came way before the estimated Delivery date,came with all the parts ,just lacked any instructions on putting it together"
2,Only lasted two years,"Bought this phone a couple of years ago to replace a failing not-very-old Sony cordless (doesn't anybody make quality phones any more?). I noticed immediately that the sound quality was not as good as the Sony but we got used to it. Within the last few months though the sound started cutting in and out so that you can't hear the caller. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe something is loose inside, I don't know but the phone is no longer usable after two years. We never used the answering function so I can't comment on that. Anyway I just ordered a Panasonic 5.8 GHz phone last night. Hopefully the third time is the charm."
4,solid design,"my husband plays a lot of soccer and is impressed with this ball. you can get a similar size ball at the local sports stores for a little less, but this is well worth the money"
3,Not hot at all,"I like this salsa, but if you're looking for something with some heat, this is not it. I didn't detect even the slightest bit of heat in the Hot version of this stuff."
2,Watery and lacking flavor,"I'm always on the lookout for a good salsa, and prefer salsas that deliver both robust flavor and heat. Sadly, Herdez fails on both accounts.My first impression when pour some salsa into a bowl was how much water there was. I had shaken the bottle prior to opening, and expected a better mix. The flavor was weak. For such a simple recipe I expected to taste tomatoes and onions, but there was really nothing there. The heat was also far short of what I expected from a salsa listed as hot. A little of an afterburn, but disappointing.I'll not be buying another bottle. The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it is affordable and could be used as a base for a better home-brew salsa, but I expect to be able to dig in right out of the jar."
5,"This book is a ""must"" for romance novel readers.",Your novels are wonderful. They remind me of the books I liked so much by Mallory Burgess. Keep writing!!!
