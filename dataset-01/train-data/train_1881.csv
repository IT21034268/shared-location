2,out-dated,"I guess it depends on what you are looking for, you may find this book useful or not. For me, it was waste of time. I went a half way through now and I am not getting much new that I did not know before.This is a collection of papers, so it feels scattered. Each author gives a very narrow and specific view to the part of UI design that they worked on and of course they are out-dated. This is not what I was looking for in a book titled ""The art of human-computer interface design"".As someone said, they should recall this book and revise to get it up to date."
4,see all the other reviews for the history lesson,"The Summer of Love was not easy on all of its revellers, regardless of their innate musical brilliance. Moby Grape definitely got the short end of the stick.Considering the musicality of such catchy rock numbers as the quick-fingered ""Aint No Use"" or the resolute ""I Am Not Willing,"" it's stunning their name isn't dropped more frequently with the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, or even Quicksilver Messenger Service. They could rock harder than most of their contemporaries, often were more delicate and concise too, and had the added firepower of 3-part vocal harmonies which put them in a league with the Byrds.All the right ingredients can be present and still not result in success or acclaim. These are the hits you never heard, and an unfiltered taste of the San Francisco sound in the late sixties."
2,Not What You Think,"I thought this would have tips on playing techniques, tricks in sight reading, or adice from pros. It contains only a handful of useful tips. For the most part it covers string boiling, making straps, setting string, and other maintenance related topics not actual playing."
4,101 Bass Tips,"Nice book; I thought I knew the trick of the trade, but learnt some more from this book.Easy to read and to follow"
2,"Very good for beginners, not for anyone who has ever gigged...","I bought this book online after playing for about 3 years with very minimal gigging. I found about 5-7 items that I didn't already know just from the time I actually spent with the instrument. I didn't really think it was worth the money and gave it to Goodwill shortly after. But, I say all that with the understanding that if you are brand new to playing, the book may be worth it. Lots of tips, just such basic ones as to not enlighten someone with a little bit of experience."
4,Great Tips from one of the Best,"This book and the accompanying CD has some great practical information. I have playing Bass and Guitar semi-professionally for almost thirty years. There is information in this book I found most useful. If you are familiar with Gary Willis, you know this is one of if not the best fretless bass player alive today. His approach to the bass in general is simple and easy to understand for anyone from beginner to advanced. The accompanying CD has some nice melodic study. Worth the money get it!"
3,solo and old info!,"This is a book best suited for players who want some solo tips, and can read music, lots of filler, kind of jumps around a bit without reference to any subject or tip,lots of things you (bass player) should know come on, making a guitar strap! in fairness I have not listened to th cd but I thought it might be more info on being a better ove-rall bass player, you how to pick up on new tunes quickly mabey useful chourd patterns,and ear& site training tips, not quit so specialised."
5,Picture Perfect,"What a wonderfully rich and sumptuous romantic story. I fell in love with the characters and didn't want the story to end. There was just enough intrique and mystery for the analyst in me. I can see another story evolving from the secondary characters. Hmmm. Thanks Ms. Harrison for a great, great read!!!!"
5,AN EXCELLENT ROMANTIC MYSTERY!!!,"THIS BOOK IS SIMPLY FANTASTIC. ONCE I STARTED TO READ IT, I COULD HARDLY PUT IT DOWN. THE CHARACTERS OF JUSTIN AND DAVINA WERE VERY MUCH LIKE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN ONLY THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT. THE AUTHOR REALLY KNEW HOW TO DRAW YOU INTO THE LIVES OF THE CHARACTERS AND MAKE YOU BEG FOR MORE!!! THE PLOT TWISTS WERE SO GREAT. WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD THE PLOT FIGURED OUT, IT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT YOU THOUGHT. THE MYSTERY AND THE ROMANCE WAS SO INTENSE THAT I FOUND MYSELF STAYING UP LATE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. (THIS COMING FROM FROM A PERSON WHO HAD TO BE UP AT 4 A.M.).JOB WELL DONE, MS. HARRISON. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT BOOK. HURRY!!!!"
5,very early freddy,"YEEEEEAAAAAH,i finally got my copy of this promo album on cd,and found out that it was only ever done on a very limited promo release,it has 23 songs,and all are bangers,freddie takes us on a verble rollacoaster,the cover is green in colour as is the cd,and the back cover,it sort of looks plane but its only a promo,the thing is theres not even any bootleged copys of this around,cause you still need at least 1 original somewhere in the process to copy,and its just that rare,its mega hard to find,ive been collecting cd/music for years and this is the first copy ive ever seen,also the sound quality is only about a 8 out of ten,due to it only being done on promo,but all in all,its dope,rare,and worth the trouble to find,if anyone would like a copy of this contact me at hokesone@hotmail.com,and we can work it out from there,im not selling my copy,but i would glady bootleg a copy for you."
2,This book offers very little practical advice.,"The text of this book can be summarized as ""try to understand your child, accept and love him, acknowledge your part in the problem and everything will turn out alright."" While there is a lot of truth in this, the book offers very little practical advice as to how to go about changing things. The STEP books by Dinkmeyer give the same advice but then go a step further and tell you how to do it"
4,Solid book,"Maps are good, but could be a little more complete. Found a typo or two on it, but worked for me to navigate to more obscure parts of Alsace."
1,Without Mercy,A pathetic book. Stilted writing. Poor unbeleivable story line.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. An axample of a writer cashing in on his previous successes. I am angry to contribute to the writers wealth.
2,A fast read,"Some of this book I liked ,but on the whole I felt it lacked truth in storytelling,the good guys are one step ahead, the bad guys seem like idiots and the plot is very thin, but I still read the book and I was entertained for a few hours."
4,Keep the faith,"After reading the other reviews I have to say I must have read another book. I cannot help my faith in Mr. Higgins Dillon, Billy, Ferguson and all the others that keep you turning the pages faster each reading. Yes, I have to acknowledge that Sean Dillon series somewhat mirrors itself from book to book but is that what we want? Didn't John Wayne's characters? For my money I will stick with Mr. Higgins stories and only hope for more."
2,Dillon slows up,"WithoutMercy had the potential for being a great sequel. It did approach this end but quickly shifted gears away from being the thriller I come to expect from Jack Higgins. I was disappoointed with the very limited roles of Jake Cazlet and Blake Johnson, yet pleased to see that General Ferguson""promoted"" Billy Salter into the Service. The IRA antagonists to Dillon never reached the crescendo they did in Dark Justice and certainly Dillon and Blake Johnson rarely interacted thus leaving the reader wondering about why Blake was even involved in this story. Higgins has to keep Dillon on the edge and use Blake and Billy as foils the way he so ably used Hannah Bernstein.Higgins is still a master of the genre but I feel he wrote this one ""Without Mercy"" for his loyal fans and readers."
1,"No More Dillon Please, Mr. Higgins","Mr. Higgins, I am one of your biggest fans. However, the Sean Dillon thing has really been done to death. For your next novel, please write a nice WWII thriller, with Devlin, some good Germans, some bad Germans, and lots of Bushmills. Also, the only computers back then used bicycle chains and sprockets, (Ultra) or tubes, so you don't have to try to figure out modern computer technology. This will make your characters more believable."
1,Lost,"I totally agree with J. Saperstein's review. The plot really didn't make any sense to me, and I wasn't aware that I had missed the previous book ""Dark Justice"", which may have helped me to understand the story better. It took me forever to read, and I hate to say - It was boring! But I will go back and read Dark Justice and maybe it will help me to understand the plot better.Maybe he is tired of writing. Those characters are becoming wimps!"
3,Too many typo's,"I have read about 5 Sean Dillons recently and still enjoy the same format and characters, however this one I think, had more typos than usual including repeating the title and authors name in the middle of the text on one page and one of the IRA baddies having a name change. Still, I will buy the remaining few of the Dillon series over the coming weeks except for number 8, I think which is still not availableCheers"
2,This is a poor outing by Higgins. Don't waste your time.,"This is not a good effort by Higgins. I liked the beginning. The middle loses the intensity of all of the other books before this mess. A poor effort to say the least. What happened Higgins? Why did you write this supposed good book? I liked everything else you wrote. Thi is not you at all. What a shame. I was hoping fior a great book. Instead, all I got was this. Ok the bad guy didnt go through his assignment. OK the President did everything he had to. OK the other characters helped out but why? I didnt understand much of this outing at all."
3,why do you do it?,"just checking out the reviews. have not read this book yet. i had to rate this book or this submission would not be accepted. i do wish certain people would not tell those of us who have not read the book that someone dies and then reveal the name of that person. a review should be written that does not reveal important details. in harry potter and the half blood prince, everyone said ""someone dies"". that is ok."
2,Where is Jack Higgins?,"Years ago I would pick up a Jack Higgins novel with anticipation,knowing that I was in for an enjoyable few hours. Now I pick up a Higgins novel hoping against hope that I will see a spark of the old Jack Higgins. Alas, his novels are getting progressively worse. As Jerry Saperstein put it in his review, Higggins has hit bottom in this latest outing.There's so much wrong with this latest Sean Dillon venture that it's hard to know where to begin. Cardboard characters, juvenile dialogue, inane plotting are just the beginning. It's time to end this Sean Dillon serial. It's become a joke. Higgins is ripping off the public by putting out this stuff milking his earlier success without putting in a honest day's work. The big question is: does he still have in him to produce a decent novel on a par with his earlier work."
1,Poor quality,Looks OK but the quality is so bad that it actually looks very cheap and in reality is not that cheap.
3,Satisfactory read,"Ill Wind disappointed me; I knew what killed the park ranger as soon as Nevada Barr described the scene. What took Anna Pigeon so long to figure it out? No matter, the story kept me entertained although it was annoying Anna took so long."
2,Was there a story here?,"Why did I bother when I hated the last Nevada Barr book? For the Mesa Verde setting. Long story short: Anna Pigeon is a lush, she left an NPS post she liked for what seems a contrived reasons, lives in a dorm with a bunch of self-centered girls (using the term on purpose). Then she solves the ""mystery"" and gets housing of her choice. Of course being Anna, she'll leave for another National Park right away.The story made no sense; the writing was disjointed; the characters either unsympathetic or enigmatic to a fault. What Nevada Barr doesn't know about Navajo culture would fill a few encyclopedias. For a great series set in this region, read Tony Hillerman."
2,Odd,"I found this book in the free bin where I live and picked it up. It was a give-away from the library (I can see why) that I was cursed with picking up. Never really developed characters, characters not all that engaging and a bland non-engaging pace. 3/4ths of the way I found myself thinking of the characters as the characters from Scooby Doo cartoons I would watch when I was a kid, trying to to take the mask off the ""monster"" and sadly that thought never ended.The idea was not bad, the excution, awful."
2,Nothing particularly unique or special as mysteries go..,"I had heard so much hoopla about Nevada Barr's books I had to read one for myself. I bought ILL WIND and read it in a week. However, I found it pretty average as far as a good mystery story goes. There was nothing compelling about her characters, nothing special about her geographical descriptions, and nothing to write home about overall. I was not impressed."
4,Mountain of Bones,"This book has also been published with the title ""Mountain of Bones"" so don't buy it twice like I did!I like these books. They are not predictable, which is unusual and good. After reading so many crime novels and about forensics, it is refreshing not to be able to pick the killer, and be thinking for half the book ""c'mon stupid main character, he/she's the killer!""The only problem I have is the long bits of describing the scenery."
3,Good and bad join hands,"I suspect the recording engineer in Stuttgart took a dislike to Zacharias, because Concertos 17 and 19, which Zacharias plays very well, have harmonic distortion on the piano, but not the orchestra. A classic example of the famous inconsistency of EMI is the third movement of Concerto 11, where the volume slowly creeps upward until the music is simply too loud. I had to re-record it on my CDR, carefully lowering the volume as the movement progressed. Another problem is that the performances of Concertos 22 and 23 are old and anemic. He should have re-recorded them for this set. On the bright side, Zacharias is the first pianist since Rudolf Serkin in 1962 to play No. 14 at the proper tempo. Other concertos are rather well played, and Zacharias has a good sense of humor which is expressed in the cadenzas. Apparently this recent issue is already out of print, which is a shame, because it would be a good gift for music lovers who don't know Mozart well."
5,Works with Verizon V640,"I bought this to use with a Verizon V640 ExpressCard 34 EVDO wireless broadband card. I did a lot of research and knew that there was a small chance it wouldn't work, since some ExpressCards are PCI-X and not USB based.The V640 is USB based so this card works well with it. Used it all day today no complaints at all. Feels solidly built.My computer is a Thinkpad T40 which is holding me over until I get a new computer maybe next year (I'm eyeing a MacBook Pro)."
1,DId I get a Dud Unit?,"Bought a used one from a marketplace seller. I use Vista Business 32bit. No driver was found by the OS and the adpater is not functional. It shows up as PCMCIA MTD-0002. According to SIIG website, driver for the adpater is built in for Vista. Contacting seller right now to resolve the issue.SIIG web site did not provide a technical support number to call. Only a phone number for RMA requests.Will update when I hearing back form the seller."
1,not worth the money,"Was looking for a book with more advanced teaching on haircutting, and for the money basically was teaching one haircut. Would not even recommend for a novice"
3,fail.,It wasn't what they had a picture of. it wasn't what it described.it was the other cab shirt and it was blue.this was a fail.I'll keep it but this is not a five star delivery.giving it three stars is me being chill.
5,Bowie and Big Knife Fighting System,I feel this is a good fundamental book on the subject referenced. If one wants something more advanced there are books out there. The book satisfies all claims made. I've seen some less favorable reviews that are just looking for some minor picky detail to rant about. This book does the job it was intended for.
5,An important addition to any training library,"All the reviews about this excellent book speak for themselves. There is really nothing else for me to add except that I found McLemore's DVD on Bowie Knife and Big Knife Dueling as an excellent supplement to his Big Knife training system. You really cannot go wrong with anything Col. McLemore puts in print. An author, trainer, and historian par excellence. He is the standard by which all others are judged in the arena of Frontier Martial Arts due to the quality of his instruction as well as the many books he has written."
3,"Decent introduction, but no more than that.","As a broad, basic introduction to the use of the large knife, it's a decent book but with very few exceptions, it's not much more than that.The drawings are fine, but repetitive and sometimes contradict the accompanying text. If you have a knife or fencing background, there's unlikely to be much new for you here."
3,Evidence Bible.,"While the content is very informational, it does not navigate well. It reads more like a chapter book than a Bible."
5,Best Bible I have ever got!,"It has large print and they have modernized the King James for much easier reading. No Thou's in there, but the text matches up with the King James. Great foot notes and articles everywhere."
4,Great idea!,"This bible is more of an evangelical tool than a study bible. Buy it for the ""evidence"" it provides, not as a primary study bible. The ""comfortable"" KJV seems fine to me - similar to the NKJV. Good addition to the Christian library!"
5,The Evidence Bible,This is one of my favorate Bibles that I have. He takes quesions that people are asking and puts the answers in the chapters you are reading. I have given a couple away as a gift and plan on doing more. It is a great study aid for those who are already believers or for those who are searching.
4,Really enjoy this Bible but a bit hard to read on Kindle,"I think I may eventually purchase this in paperback. The only reason I have hesitated is because of some reviews of missing pages. This one is complete, and while it allows you to go straight to a specific chapter, it doesn't allow you to go to a specific verse which would have been helpful in church. I love the questions and answers. They are great practical questions that are very intriguing."
4,b-legit rides the beat on every track,"don't know what the other reviews are about. album is legit. b-legit doesnt disappoint on his delivery on any track. 3rd verse of ""sic wid it"" is off the hook, flow matches tha beat perfectly. almost all songs are solid. sum of the appearance are weak but b-legit comes strong the whole album. ""trap game"" beat is sick along with others"
3,And yet another kids to criminals to wake up call movie,"This film is yet another rehash of that glut of films about kids who begin lives of crime early on, go to jail, and come out either enlightened or unchanged. Set in South Boston, WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU happens to star some fine actors in Mark Ruffalo, Ethan Hawke, and Amanda Peet, and their presence makes the film watchable. It is just tiresome to watch repeats an this 'bad kid' (Ruffalo) turned junkie turned convict turned negligent husband and father turned AA whose ability to make decent decisions finds him clueless until the end of the film.The flavor of South Boston and prison and petty crimes becoming major crimes is well paced by writer/director/actor Brian Goodman. But this rambling story is ultimately boring - except for the pleasure of watching Mark Ruffalo inhabit this loser of a character. An OK movie, not a great one. Grady Harp, May 09"
2,thugs in the city,"The whole theme of this movie seems to be we should see these thugsas people? They are out beating up and robbing people from the time they are kids.That they could have a family life on the other side of robbing and doing cocainemakes them human?I thought that the movie about modern mobsters in the big citywas just pretty nasty instead of the exciting it was supposed to be.Aside from having a really bad plot, the acting , costumes and setting was well done.This movie is just not one you would want to bring hometo watch after dinner."
2,Formulaic,"Despite a great cast, this story is another in the ""South Boston"" boys gone wrong genre. Morever, the first three-quarters of the film is jumbled, dimly lit and uninspired. It picks up thereafter with some suspense over the protagonist's moral quandry."
1,"Not Another Petty Crime, Drugs Movie","How many rehashes of movies about kids growing up in an impoverished neighborhood get guns, pursue drugs, petty crime, time locked up and get out to do it all over again are we going to continue to get. It's like reading the same book over and over again. Just another bill paying movie for the studios. Thank you free library rental and fast forward."
4,Time Flies By,"Do you want to read a fantastic book with hidden meaning? Guests is a thought provoking, suspensful,action filled,ongoing, and interesting historical fiction book. It also has a funny part with a talking porcupine! A Native American boy named Moss runs away because he doesn't want the ""strangers""(European settlers)to come for the feast. He makes a friend named Trouble while he ran away.Moss learns a valuable lesson from running away."
1,Don't buy HP No. 78 Large Tri-Color Cartridge from NetSales,"I want to give advice to all you want to buy this ""HP No. 78 Large Tri-Color Cartridge"" from netsales-usaDon't do it, because it shows original HP pictures but it is a fake one. Just a compatiable one not HP product.I prefere to buy all products from AMAZON."
1,Inferior ink,"Gave it a try because the price was hard to beat, but as the old saying goes, you do get what you pay for... The color is very inaccurate, dull, and after repeated attempts to align the colors, registration is off, lines appear through anything with even low to moderate coverage. If color accuracy and quality are of no concern, then it's a good buy, if not then stay away and break your bank on the original..."
1,HP No. 78XL Inkjet Cartridge,"When I researched this item, the website said it was compatable with HP no. 17 Injet Cartridge. When I received it and installed it in the printer the printer indicated it was out of ink and would not print anything. Don't know if it is the cartidge or if it is out of ink right out of the box. So I am out the price of the cartridge. So much for buying online."
1,HP 970Cse prints SLOW,"We have an HP 970Cse for the last few years and have tried everything under the sun to get it to printer more clearly and faster, and nothing has worked, including this cartridge. We replaced the 970Cse with an Epson Stylus C84 and are 100% happier."
1,So much for HP quality.,"When I install a brand new real-live HP cartridge, it shouldn't have missing jets.Even after I waste DOLLARS of ink doing Level 3 clean, it still has missing/clogged jets. This is simply unacceptable. HP needs to get their act together.Now, what do I do? Send it back to Amazon?And what's this ""Singapore"" stuff? HP spent about $1-billion making that state of the art robotic cartridge plant in Corvallis OR. I guess Singapore manufacture is somehow cheaper than a FULLY automated factory?Bob (former R+D engineer at The Hewlett-Packard Company, not ""hp"")"
3,Out of date product.,It might work - or it might not. I think providing out dated products is deceptive. I'd like the practice changed. Bad feeling remains.
5,Great and lasts forever,"Just a me-too of the other review. Quality should be a given, and that's here, but I'm still amazed by how long I've been using this cartridge. Dozens and dozens of high-quality glossies at photo-quality resolutions, all spectacular. (I'm using the excellent HP 970Cse, which I can also recommend. Double-sided printing is even handier than it sounds.) The other compatible cartridge has less than half the capacity according to the specs, so why bother?"
3,too much,I found the HP to be not as good or as sharp as an epson that I use at work. I'm also amazed that no one has commented that the color ink cart. is 20% of the cost of the complete printer. The three colors in one cartridge is a real rip-off. I'm replacing a cartridge for almost $50 that has most of two colors remaining.
5,Top Dog for 970Cxi,"I have been using the 78 since I purchased by 970 Deskjet Printer. When I first got my printer all I could get was the low capacity 78. That was a bummer, since I do a lot of color printing. I do Christmas cards, birthday cards, posters, newsletters and they all come out great. I am grateful for the large capacity. Can do so much more at a better price."
3,"Covers the material, but not a joy to read","I think it covers the material pretty well, but it is not what I was expecting. Plain black and white print on almost card stock, but not a slick finish. Not enough depth to be real useful to me. So, I would suggest you look at one before you buy. It may be what you are looking for, but it was not what I was looking for."
3,"Great for teachers, not for PLT study","I think it has some great advice for new teachers, but it is way off the mark as far as preparing someone for the PLT. Sadly, I have to take the PLT a second time, and the case studies in this book are nothing like what is on the real PLT. On the practice tests, it has you write an essay, but on the PLT, you have two parts for each question. A big difference between this book and the PLT is that with this book, you don't realy need to read the scenario to answer the case study questions. Some of the case studies seem like short stories with a happy ending. The multiple choice questions were OK, but a lot of them are based on information in the book, not PLT. Again, I thought it had some good information as far as helping a new teacher, but the two practice tests are nothing like what I saw the first time I took the PLT."
5,Great help!,"I bought this for a friend who will be taking the test. From my experience, this book is a great help."
1,Poor Source for PLT Preparation,"I bought this book because of its low price - and regretted it. I wish I had looked inside the book before purchasing it. Spend the extra money and buy the one sold by the testmaker, ETS."
3,I tried,I tried to love this book. I really did. I failed. I may try again as I was left with with a certain longing to better understand it and its characters. Read this if you have the heart of a poet. Dare I say that it might appeal most to women?
1,Your Kidding RIGHT?,Great product! I USED TO order this for about $53.00 and some change. But in the last couple of weeks it has been raised to $80.00?!?! Seriously???? THIS is why I give it one star. Will most definitely be switching.
4,THIS 'S WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT! ERIC GABLE'S GOT ME WANTING MORE!,"Man, I'm so starved for R&B; music! I'm like a desert buzzard still gnawing on a coyote leg bone! That's how bad it's gotten!So, I got this cd just as a goof! I expected nothing!...But I got to hear a very talented and soulful brother named Eric Gable lay down some sweet NEW JACK/R&B; soul!My two favorite tracks are PROCESS OF ELIMINATION and I would have loved to have heard MICHAEL JACKSON do a remake of this song,I'M NOT THE ONE!Eric Gable, vocally, almost reminds me a little of a ""buzzed off Cognac "" James Ingram singing Teddy Riley songs circa 1995...but that's a good thing!I only wish that there was no raps on PROCESS OF ELIMINATION and I'M NOT THE ONE!...Peace!"
4,Great album,"I really liked this album. I was so happy to hear the songs. The 90s was a real quality music era and I enjoyed these tracks 1, 2, & 4. #2 is a slow sexy song where 1 & 4 are more upbeat. Definitely happy I bought the album."
3,"OK, but has a few issues so far","I bought this a few weeks back and have used it about 10 times now.The lens is made up of two parts, a macro lens, and a wide angle lens that screws on top of the macro lens.I am very much an newbie to photography so cant comment much on the lenses but here is the issue I am facing with this lens.Once its screwed on to my camera (Fuji S5200), it takes a bit of work to unscrew it completely. Typically when you unscrew it, the wide angle comes off, but the macro is still screwed on to the camera.The other issue is I am begining to find the black paint along the rim just next to the lens peeling off slightly (most probably from all the times the wide angle got unscrewed from the macro) and falling onto the lens surface."
1,Horrible Product,"The quality of this lens leaves MUCH to be desired. Images have so much distortion that unless you want a shot that looks like you put it through the Liquify filter in Photoshop then they're practically unusable. I've been a photographer for over 10 years and I realize that shooting very wide (or even fisheye) will ""stretch"" your image. This adapter does not leave you with type of effect.If you choose to buy it anyway don't say you weren't forewarned. I can't even, in good conscience, resell it to someone else to try and get some of my money back. Very disappointing and has caused me to swear off anything with Opteka's name on it."
2,Limited-use supplemental lens,"You can't expect a lot from a supplemental lens that sells for less than $40, and with the Optica .45x lens, you get what you pay for. On my Fujifilm 9000 camera, usable focal length on the 9000's zoom lens is from about 30mm to 45mm. At 28mm, there is vignetting (dark at the corners). At more than 45mm, the corners become fuzzy, so it's not usable in the medium and telephoto focal lengths unless you're trying to simulate tunnel vision. Also, as I expected, spherical abberation (straight lines appear curved near the edges of the frame) is apparent at the all the usable focal lengths (that is, between 30 and 45mm). That's common with all but the most expensive fisheye lenses."
5,Simply Great!,"I was a little bit afraid of buying this one, because I know that a lens adapter maybe can carry problems with the autofocus or blurring some part of the picture.That doesn't happen with this lens, it's great!, I have a Fuji S9000 at the sharp of the image is just excellent!, great lens. Also if you take the main it leaves you with a kind of macro adapter also great!.In my case, the lens of my camera is 28 mm with a diameter of 58mm, with this adapter the resulting picture is like a seudo fisheye image, comparable of a lens around 16mm.I really recommend this one!"
2,How well this product performs depends on the dimensions of the wood.,"This kit has a feature that tracks the outer tip of the wood tongue. Consequently you cannot adjust the depth of the nail set with shims. If your wood supplier has the exact tongue length this kit is looking for your good to go. If not your sol.Also on 3/4 thick wood, the feature that tracks the tongue isn't overlapping it by much so be careful else it will slip off and put a nail in the face of the wood. This is less of a problem on 1/2 inch wood."
4,works fine,"This flooring adapter was purchased as an add on for a reconditioned Bostitch flooring stapler. It does what is says it does, protect the finish and the tongues of your pre-finished flooring. The wide base makes it easy to use you foot to stabilize the stapler from ""bounce back"". I found that the recommended method of tapping in the flooring using the area to either side of the foot didn't work as well as using a scrap piece of hardwood with the tongue cut off. This worked especially well when two people worked together.Again, it works fine and is as advertised."
4,"whittier, california's best kept secret",please don't be fooled by the terrible cd photo. This is some of the best LA Latin Jazz that you'll ever hear. My favorite is Sonido de Trombone. One of the moodiest songs I've ever heard. Put this on and think about the things happening in your life. One of the tastiest bone solo's I've ever heard..
5,A MUST HAVE FOR COLLECTORS,"Jim Fox is extremely precise with his information. Excellent guide for collectors, includes wonderful color pictures of actual plates for all U.S. states."
4,Appropriate for trips,"I purchased this item for my 15 month old for a 3-hr plane ride. It is quite smaller than the travel doodle, but perfect for what I needed it for...a toddler who can doodle and watch it magically erase. It is extremely light and pretty thin so carrying it in her diaper bag was great! It will also come in handy for restaurants as well."
3,The World and Thorinn,"Bought this book to replace one that was damaged in relocation. If either of us had read it recently enough to remember the plot, we probably wouldn't have bought a new copy. What was Damon Knight smoking?"
5,What is the world really all about?,This is a great book. If you like Orphans of the Sky or even that old game Metamorphosis Alpha you may very well like the world Thorinn inhabits. He discovers and uncovers the true nature of his world. This book has great development and wonderful writing.
5,Marvin.....Marvin...,What can I say - Marvin Gaye...there will never be another singer as Marvin Gaye. No matter what album you may purchase...you will not be disappointed...This is a great album having so many of his older songs...this is a 5 Star album! A must have album!
5,My Favorite Recording Ever!,"This CD is one of my most played albums in my collection, because it has ""Every Great Motown Hit"" of Marvin Gaye. Don't be confused by its price compared to every other Greatest Hits album, because this beats anyone I have ever heard. Every song will have you in stitches and will make you want to experience more music by similar artists. This was my first album from the sixties/seventies, and not it is my favorite genre of music. Don't even bother to listen to this album before you buy it, because you will automatically be put in a trance by it. Enjoy!"
3,My CD collection began here,"In Nov.1993 I bought my first CD player & my first CD,which was this one. A couple months before,I bought a cheap cassette of this album,but my cassette deck ate it.I got fed up with tapes & got into CD's & I've bought hundreds since. I couldn't give this 5 stars because of its title. This album doesn't have anywhere near ""every great Motown hit of Marvin Gaye"". If I listed other great Motown hits of Marvin Gaye,they could & should have made this at least a 2 disc set. I know that years later, better Gaye compiliations came out & I wish I had waited."
4,Just about everything I was looking for.,"I had no Marvin Gaye music in my collection... a serious oversight on my part. Everthing I wanted to hear again is in this collection (IMHO), and if it isn't, I guess I'm getting too old to remember it! Glad I bought this!"
2,Wrong title,"This does not contain every great Motown hit of Marvin Gaye, despite its title. There are far better compilations of his work out there.There is a two-disc collection that is more complete with all his early stuff and dance music too."
2,Retrospective By Leon Russel,I was very happy to find it on Amazon . But was disappointed by the sound that I hear when I play it... Especially on the track Song for you which is my favorite There seems to a defect on the CD and I didn't notice until one day when I played it loud . I feel that I should be able to return it and get a better one. Please advise if this is possible.As I know when I realized it was past the return policy time frame.
2,so-so,"I bought this without getting to listen to samples since none was offered. Had I done that, I wouldn't have bought the CD because I like a more low-key chilled sound, and this was too loud and not my kind of songs. It was OK but not great."
4,"effective, useful resource","An effective and useful reference book on the ""wireless internet."" It covers the technologies, markets, products and services, citing many real applications in a easily readable format. I think this book would satisfactorily serve the student and industry professional as a useful single source of information."
4,good overview,"Good overview on subject-- like a Cliff Notes, covers the key points but if you need details you'll have to buy books and visit the websites which are listed in the appendix. The book is easy to read (I read the book from cover to cover on flight from San Jose to Chicago last week with time to spare)."
2,For stand alone Server only,This book doesn't seem to cover in detail about our real world situation. That is -- having multiple Exchange servers with different versions throughout the organization. It does a great job explaining about each function within Microsoft Exchange administrator and Outlook. But lacks examples to help readers understand.
4,good summary; lack of programmer's information,"This book provides excellent summary of the networking aspects of exchange server and an introduction to its application-development capabilities. However, specific programming procedures are not covered."
2,"Yikes, I can't believe I used this for my first install!","Ok, so my first exchange install was 5.0 a couple of years back - but now owning both versions of the Using Exchange Server books and extensive Exchange Admin experience - I gotta tell ya - there has to be a better book out there.It seems that the layout and general reading of this book are almost identical to the earlier edition - dry, dry and dry.Missing real world issues with installation errors you may run into and common maintence proceedures that a typical Exchange Admin might follow."
2,Que doesn't usually disappoint....,"I administer a relatively small company's network and while some of the issues I have related to Exchange are also of a small scale this book was ineffective at answering even those questions.It was especially light on covering the integration of Exchange server with client-side software like Outlook 9x. Also, the importance of regular maintenance and how to perform said maintenance was grossly understated and glossed over. One might almost say misleading.Look elsewhere for answers."
3,Track Lighting Kit,Overpriced. The 360 rotation is fine but the up and down is so rigid that you need to hold the base of the light or you will damage it. The light sockets within the lamp fixtures easily move and become misaligned when repositioning the lights. A more reasonable price for such a low tech made in China product would be about 25 to 30.
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed that his came with no way to get electricity to the lights. I have to buy an expensive power supply to make this work.
3,Nice Piano Illuminatiom,"I installed these with a cord to illuminate my grand piano's music stand. My apartment is a rental so I needed it to install with a plug. The cost is good. The quality is lowish, and it was difficult to move the cans along the slide. My husband was cussing a lot when he put it up. The clips to hold the cord to the wall pried off in a few weeks. But now that's it's up and adjusted it looks and works great."
3,"Great lighting kit, but some arrived with damage.","Overall, I'm pleased with this plug-in track light. But, among the multiple units that I purchased, some arrived damaged. The black ring around the unit was broken beyond repair."
3,Some Disapointment,I liked my lights but they arrived with the package damaged and the plastic rings were broken in one light. I am not happy at the prospect of trying to return such a large packege over a broken plastic item.
4,Not Bad!,"This bench is pretty good. The directions are not the best, but there is only so many pieces it wasn't to hard to figure out. It only took 30 minutes to put together. It looks great! It is very sturdy. I am using it as a TV stand for my 32""."
2,Holes drilled incorrectly,The machine used to drill the holes in the wood was set for a different product and it was impossible to assemble. We received a replacement and it was fine.
2,Prepac Sonoma bench,"poorly made. plastic connectors snapped with light tap.many predrilled holes did not match up.instructions for assembly unclear.I used wood glue in construction,in place of the pegs and nails. have assembled 2 bookcase and several shelving units,with less difficulty."
1,it was a bad ring,the ring changed colors real fast it was gold at first then whent to a rose color and the stone was lose ya need to give me my money back for this item
4,Difficult but comprehensive,"I have been looking for the most comprehensive book on Software Engineering to be used by both my colleagues in my software company... and my students in Cairo University.I found this book to be a comprehensive one stressing a quantitative approach compared to other more popular books like Sommervile, Fleeger, etc. The book covers most of the topics with case studies, a lot of Exercises, and reference to software engineering standards.I am really surprised that this book is not popular and I definitely recommend it to the community so as to be able to build better software."
5,What a wonderful book to read and share,"A friend gave me this book and once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. I believe the title might be misleading because I believe it hits on many things in life and many situations that we all go through, this book is for everyone. I loved the books so much I bought ten of them and passed them out to family and friends. I received the same reaction from the people I gave it to!"
5,A Good Self-help book to choose love over fear,"Anything other than love is fear based. Many couples are so accustomed to choosing fear over love it is second nature. The Kane's share tools and stories to assist couples to make good choices and keep love alive. Many couples have been conditioned to shutdown, and are more comfortable pulling away. This book is a great guide to build a good foundation for love. Annie B. Lawrence, author of Love's Secret Live Your Life In Love."
3,Just okay,"I did not feel that this book lived up to the reviews that I had heard. I was a good book, but not as helpful as I had hoped."
1,Extremely dissatisfied,"The product was not received. I am still waiting to hear from the shipper. No contact number, no tracking number, nothing. This purchase has cost me much inconvenience and grief. I need some kind of compensation for this."
3,Quality off & Amazon listing lacking,"[Note this was purchased under my account, but was for my husband (Amazon name Foxtrot). See his comments which are very in-depth...from an actual EE... on the topic. My comments on the product are below.]Quality seemed lacking (China's quality version of ""good""): button and switch feel like they will break after a while (cheap) and the plastic is the thin stuff. The case is better quality than the tool (sad)!The Amazon listing's information seems to be different from information on the product packaging (some of which I didn't understand, but could tell was different ... I am a novice in this field). Microfarad is being shown as ""mF"" but I know as uF (so be aware of that). It wasn't clear the black and red cables with ""alligator clips"" were attached permanently on the back side. There is nothing on the packaging saying ""+/- 5% Accuracy"", not sure if that is true or not."
5,Can't wait for the DVD!,"I've been looking and looking for The Legend of Jesse James on VHS or DVD. Now, I can't wait to purchase it on DVD -- it will happen soon, won't it!?!"
5,Please bring us Christopher Jones as Jesse James!,I have such fond memories of this short lived series! I would definitely buy the DVD if it becomes available. I still think of this show over 40 years after it first aired. Please help us baby boomers re-live our fantasy with Christopher Jones as Jesse James! He was a hot as they get!Patty
4,A Pip of A Christmas,"Kind of interesting that Gladys Knight begins this collection with the largely spoken word version of ""The Night Before Christmas"" that's actually quite tastefully done and serves as a reminder that a good singer is usually a good narrator in a spoken context. Gladys and the boys don't actually overdo it on any of the tracks here. She's always been soulful and expressive without pulling out all the stops. She focuses on the songs' lyrics and leaves the ornamentation to the instruments for the most part. It's a tendency shared by the Pips as well. When they step up for a solo, as on ""The Christmas Song,"" it's smooth, clean and not show-offy at all. Like all good singers, Gladys Knight knows when to do understated and when to go full-throttle. Economizing at Christmas is a good idea, for singers it's a virtual must. Gladys Knight doesn't overdo it here, but she does add an element of soul to the Christmas songs you already know. It works beautifully for the most part. Recommended."
4,A Fashionista Must,i saw this book on Amazon and i bought it used i was not going to pay over $30 for it! This book is Uber Chic and Sophisticated its a book with pictures of Jordi labanda work! This book is great for a coffee table its very Metropolitan and International if you like chic fashion then you will love this book The only reason i gave it 4 and not five was b/c of the price i would not pay over $30 No way and b/c its very edgy -not for young girls - being that am 22 its all good lol
2,a kinda letdown to the series,"unlike the first and second book , this which follows on the series of the long tall texans and the book , most wanted , pales in comparison with the booksthe stories are too short and it just jumps into the endingnot an enjoyable readpass on this books and get others"
2,"Long Tall Texans-Emmett, Regan, Burke","Is the writer a man?, one would think so with the reading of these books. No woman worth her salt is going to put up with the arrogance and conceit of these men. The women are stong in their own fields, yet they become marshmallows at the hands of these men, get real. While the reading is easy enough, I found myself putting the book down because I would get angry. Yes, I'm aware that it is just a book, but if I'm going to spend my money, at least I should get pleasure from reading it which in this case I did not. If this is a sample of Palmer's writing, I won't being wasting my money anytime soon."
2,Two Stars,Regan and Burke's stories were pretty good. I couldn't stand Emmett at all. First he hates Melody for helping his first wife run off with another man and is very nasty to her. Then suddenly Emmett then he wants to marry her after one afternoon on the ranch and the next day Emmett to have a baby right away. This seemed to be a pattern with Emmett. After losing his parents Emmett rushed into marriage with Adell and had kidspretty soon afterwards. No one pointed out to him that maybe rushing into a marriage and a family wasn't a good idea especially after losing both his parents instead all the fault of the divorce is on his wife from what's mentioned in the book and how Emmmett tries Melody I can understand why Adell left. I liked Melody a lot. She started out the story a very strong charactor until she meets Emmett then some how loses her strong charactor along with her back bone by doing everything Emmett tells her want to do.
3,Bissell on the Cold War,"This book, published two years after his death in 1994, describes Richard Bissell's career from the OSS during WWII, thru the Marshall Plan, on to the CIA during the Cold War. It is an ideal read for cloak and dagger types and military aircraft buffs. Bissell helped in the development of the U-2 in a record twenty months, also the A-12 (the predecessor of the SR-71, and the start up of reconnaissance satellites. He was also instrumental in CIA black operations in Guatemala and Cuba. A smart but also humble man that was responsible for planning the Bay of Pigs, Bissell takes responsibility for his deficient Bay of Pigs planning- underestimating Castro's resources, and excessively optimistic military assessment, such as the feasibility of a retreat to the far away Escambray mountains as a contingency, during the failed landing in Cuba."
3,Get It For Just Two Tracks?,"If You're getting it because ""Tell Me Truly"" And ""Any Day Now"" are on there, and not on the other CDs, it's not a big whoop. It isnt that fantastic, so dont bother. And if you're a hardcore Riddlin' Kids fan (if there are such ones out there) you might as well buy this if you cant download it elsewhere.But I mean, I like Riddlin Kids. Im a casual listener. Im not a fan, but I like their stuff. Im not knockin' em or anything. So dont get wrong, they are a good band. Just not worth Seven Bucks for Five Songs, two new ones."
4,Cool buckle with a difference,"Great design, with the wood front providing a nice texture for the buckle. The wood is only a plywood front, but isn't very noticable unless up close. The only con is the rear of the buckle has a slightly-bent hook to keep the belt together, which has a tendency to tear the belt holes and thus stretch the fit of the belt."
1,Ill fitting if you are short,This dress was too large for me in the bust as I am short waisted. I could not figure out a way to make it work. If you are tall and no larger than a 10 this should work for you. Also the bust was sheer so undergarments are a bit of an issue as well.
3,"So-so, a lot of common sense, no sources","As a scholarly work this would fail due to a lack of sources for the many facts cited within. Although I think its target audience is the general public, sources for further reading would be helpful.Pooler presents an overview of consumer psychology, which mainly equates to common sense. The book is worthwhile reading but should be read in addition to some more scholarly works on consumer psychology or at least some fact books."
5,Just buy this book!,"The name says it all. No editorial necessary. Suffice it to say this book is packaged well. It's a great read. The learning is in the reading. Buy it. When you finish reading it, you'll know why you bought it. Satisfaction guaranteed."
1,Does NOT last!,I bought these because I had several packages of .9mm lead and thought the BIC brand would be good too. One by one these gave out and I am very disappointed that they did not last in light use around a house. I would not recommend these and will find another maker of mechanical pencil to use the lead I have. An old regular pencil is more dependable than this one!
2,The writing tip constantly falls apart,"I write with a fair amount of pressure (this is why I use .9mm lead). The metallic piece that holds the lead while writing consistently separates from the rest of the pencil, thus breaking the lead. Other .9mm pencils I've used do not do this. This pencil is pretty much unusable."
1,Overpriced by a factor of ten!,"Staples sells a five-pack for $6.79, that's $1.35 each. I don't get it, why are these so expensive?"
1,Not good...,Because they cancel the order. I don't know how it is. I don't like merchant not following through the deal though.
4,JUST IRIE FEELING,"Don Carlos is a strong presence in reggae. 'Just A Passing Glance' and 'Day To Day Living' are excellent albums. This disc is full of music sung along with Goldie Locks, or Gold. There's a collection out there by the name of 'Raving Tonight' that was released in 1983 with this duo. Gold played more of a background role on those selections. 'Ease Up' seems to display more of a team effort between the two singers. These songs give more shine to Gold, though Don Carlos is still the featured man here. If you like 'Raving' or just want to hear solid, pleasant reggae, check this one."
5,An awesome book!,"What I like about this book is not just the cute story about a daughter waking up her parents for the day. With a awesome adopted daughter, it's nice to have books that aren't about adoption but show a dark haired girl with blonde and brown hair parents. I imediately fell in love with this book!"
5,Great book!,This book by Priscilla Cogan had been recommended to me and I was not disappointed. Very good. I would highly recommend it.
3,Only a fair method of attaching sandpaper,"Marshalltown HS98W Hand Sander with Wooded HandleThis sander is comfortable to hold, but the method of attaching a drywall screen or sheet of sandpaper is quite crude. Marshaltown makes a better model.I.e., the following model has a quicker and easier method for attaching the sheet:QLT By MARSHALLTOWN HS901 9-1/2-Inch by 3-1/4-Inch Drywall Hand Sander with Structural Foam HandleI own several of the HS901 models."
3,More biography than scientific review,"This book is a pretty good account of K. Eric Drexler and his quest to bring ""nanotechnology"" into the popular and the scientific world. If you are looking for a book with some real theory behind it, this may not be the book for you. There is some science, but it's pretty light. You may want to get some of the books in the bibliography or something. As the book explains, part of the reason that real science on nanotechnology is hard to find is because it hasn't been widely researched yet. This book is somewhat balanced between Drexler's vision and his critics', but it usually errs on Drexler's side. To be fair to the reader, this book really should say that it's really more of a study of K. Eric Drexler than of nanotechnology."
4,Great introductory book on the concept of nanotechnology,"this is a great book to get a basic introduction to nanotechnology. it covers the span from 1959 when richard feynman first thought about nanotechnology up through the years as more people considered the possibilities, to the current day evangelist, k. eric drexler.you'll get the basic concepts, the scope of possibilities, and most importantly (i think) is the possible *dangers* in creating and using nanotechnology. few scientists consider the down-side to their creations/ideas. eric drexler does.i think after reading you'll be both astounded and scared to death of the possibilities of nanotechnology. great book!"
5,Entertaining look at a fascinating subject,"A highly entertaining look at the emerging science of nanotechnology and its leading visionary, K. Eric Drexler. The subject matter is fascinating, and Regis tells the story with his usual wit and humor. Well worth reading as a quick primer on the subject; not intended to be a dry technical text on the subject. Much in the spirit of Regis's Great Mambo Chicken; I think this one is actually a better book, but one should probably read Great Mambo Chicken first as an introduction to Regis's work."
5,A must to who ever intrested in Nanotechnology,"The Book is very interesting. it gives a full overview of Nano's past, present anf future. The subject it self is fascinating; it's like reading a science fiction novel' only it's our future."
2,Too much focus on a possible eutopia.,"The subject matter could have been the basis for an excellent read. If you want a good scientific basis for information on nanotechnology you will not find it here. This is probably the most juvenile ""science"" book I have ever read."
2,There are much better books on nanotechnology !,Ed Regis's book disturbed me since it tends to over-dramatize. If you're interested in getting good scientific stuff then get some other books. MIT Press has a nice book but I forgot its name.
2,.,"The book on this topic from MIT Press is BC Crandall's ""Nanotechnology: Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance"". As you would expect from MIT Press, it's a much deeper treatment of the subject."
3,A Lovely Christian Fiction Story,"This is a quick paced but somewhat predictable book about a mail order bride named Faith. Since her father has passed away, Faith and her sisters decide to find grooms because they can no long afford to stay with their aging aunt. Faith goes to Texas. She arrives on the back of a mule when her stage coach breaks down to the dismay of her groom Nicholas and his mother Liza Shepard. Things go terribly wrong as miscommunications and Liza's moodiness separate Faith and Nicholas. Can Faith use her faith in God to lead her in the correct direction?"
3,Christian Historical Romance,I was drawn to this book because I have a grandaughter named Faith and I enjoy Lori Copeland's writing. I was definitely not disappointed.
4,Brides of the West 1,"Faith was my first Lori Copeland book and I really enjoyed it. The story was so fun and I found myself laughing at the comical situations the characters found themselves in! This was such a sweet story, worth recommending :)"
3,Faith,"I enjoyed the story, the people in the story were intresting and I hope to read more about them. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books. Happy Reading"
3,Decent,"If you are tired of romance novels that spend most of the word count describing sexual encounters, this is a good one to choose. Its wholesome, a bit religious, and the author puts her time into description. I would not hesitate to offer this book to my teenage niece to read. However, it seems like that is who should be reading this. I understand the author probably meant this as Christian Fiction, but word choice and plot complexity remind me of Teenage Fiction more than something written for an intelligent adult."
4,Good clean book,Really enjoyed it. i‘m looking forward to reading the others in the series. nice to read faith in characters and feel good when the last page is read.
1,Unbelievable,"If you're religious, like happy endings and a light, easy romance with no surprises in store, you'll love this book. After a promising start the story flowed smoothly enough but I found it became increasingly annoying and predictable with the characters degenerating into unbelievable 'goodies'. To say all the characters lived happily-ever-after is an understatement! No imagination or originality here, the author has stuck with the tried and true romance formula which can become very tedious."
1,Really?,"After reading this book .... I had to wonder what book the other reviewers read.I thought it was a really terrible book. Couldn't stand Nicholas and his evil mother -whom we were supposed to excuse for her awful behavior because she was going throughher ""change"". Did anyone else want to strangle Nicholas?I couldn't figure out why Faith didn't get on the next stage out of town -after spending ONE nightin the presence of those two terrible people.I have read Lori Copeland books before, but never again."
1,It's free for a reason...,"This book was not shockingly bad. The writing was passable and the content was inoffensive. It was also dreadfully boring. The plot is slow moving, the characters are stale, and the big reveals are predictable. This whole thing is a cliche and would not be a terrible read if you are looking for a new, but familiar PG romance. It can be enjoyed and I myself enjoyed some of it, but there is more romance in a kindergarten playground wedding and that is totally unforgivable when you bill a book as romance."
1,Not Even Slightly Credible,"I don't believe I've ever read a novel with more erratic characters. Their actions were unpredictable (read not credible) and the outcome smacked of a Little House on the Prairie episode where the lead characters all suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder. Even though I paid nothing for the book, I felt cheated."
5,WOW!,"When I finished this book - all I could say was ""Wow!"" 'Faith' is an awesome combination of God, romance, and adventure. Faith is a sweet and caring charecter who shows how having her own faith is God, our Father, helps far better than what we can do with our own ability. I loved this book and I recommend it to everyone. Everyone, that is, who's a romantic at heart:)"
3,Hmm...,"This author has written many stories. This is her first book in the Christain genre. I can tell, and I believe other die-hard readers will too. The plot outline is fantastic, as are the mental images her words convey. However, as several of the other readers have mentioned, there are huge gaps in the climax of the story. The resolution just ""poofs"" into the characters heads and results in actions. I believe this is due to applying Biblical truths to her literary characters. At the point of leading to the climax, the charactors need to have someone or something intervene - even the Holy Spirit prompting a Bible verse into their minds! I did enjoy the book, but I will be looking forward to reading the sequel as I believe she will only improve her authorship with time and her own personal spiritual growth."
4,Faith,The book was very good. Ms. Copeland gives her main character a compassionate and clever nature. I plan to use the prologe in my classroom for prose and poetry.
4,Great,I truly enjoyed this book. The characters were so funny. I was so proud when the mother-in-law finally started to act human! Faith's antics were hilarious!
4,fun and easy to read,"this is a fun and easy to read book. it is light hearted and tells the story of mail order brides (what a funny topic). i enjoyed this, it had a happy ending and made me smile."
2,Good thing these people aren't real!,"What a disappointment! I recently revisited this book after reading it sometime in the 90s when it was first published. WOW, was it terrible! I can hardly imagine how you can have any sort of happy ending for the two characters of Liza and Nick when they are SO DARN MEAN! and then just poof they are nice and wonderful and faith actually BELIEVES it and THINKS she is in LOVE????!! When did that happen? While they were yelling at each other or ignoring each other?! Never mind pride, what ever happened to common sense? For this book to work I think you need to just take leave of every sense of reality you have and simply believe in puffs of blue smoke!! Please stop making lame romance stories even more lame by having eveyrthing go fabulous for no reason! I cannot even call this Christian fiction, for apart from Faith and Dan and a few other very minor characters I personally would never have even believed these people believed in anything!"
3,"Not great, but not awful","Historical fiction isn't my favorite genre, but this is ok if you're looking for a light, easy read. I thought the relationship between Nicholas and Faith could have been cultivated more, we don't know enough from his perspective to ""get"" him. It's basically a story about people who behave badly, know they are behaving badly, know they should do differently, but don't....until they do. Not horribly engaging."
3,Characters don't interact much,"This was okay -- I did finish the book. However, I deleted it from my Kindle when I was done as I don't intend on re-reading it. It starts off interesting with Faith travelling to Texas as a mail order bride. Her groom and future mother-in-law don't have much to say to her. She is a pastor's daughter and tries to do the right thing. The book didn't hit you over the head with Christian aspects. My issue with this romance book is that I never really believed that the two characters fell in love with each other. They were either ignoring each other, apart (when he was gone for weeks on a cattle drive) or fighting when she wasn't behaving in what he viewed as a ""proper"" manner. There were also aspects thrown in that I just didn't see what it added.... like when she decides to help out with the steeple. What did that add to the plot? It was mentioned a few times but then just went away. All in all, an okay book but nothing special."
3,Mediocre Brown,"This simply was not Brown's best work by a long shot. Try the Emarcy's with Roach first as they are supreme. Also, the Blue Note set is a great place to start. Leave this, and the ""with strings"" stuff for when you become such a Brownie fanatic that you have to have EVERYTHING."
3,Rodman Down Under,"Pretty good event for the value of this DVD. Paid only $0.98 for it and the ""No disqualification"" match between Dennis Rodman and Mr. Perfect was worth the price of this DVD. Hennig was ""Perfect"" as usual and made Dennis Rodman looked like a legitimate threat in the ring. Not a stellar event, as most of the matches were past-it wrestlers wrestling for one last chance at glory. Kinda reminiscent of the now infamous Heroes of Wrestling pay-per view event back in the late 1990's. The one other good match on the card was The Road Warriors vs. Public Enemy opening match."
2,The Equivalent of a B Movie,"I found this in the $1 box at Walmart. I couldn't resist picking this up, thinking i could at least get a laugh or too out of it. And man did I. 2 of the matches on this show (Barbarian/Beefcake and The womens match) are 2 of the worst matches i may have ever seen. The show is terrible. It's corny, the wrestling is bad, the camera work is pretty terrible... But with that said, there are points that are so bad you will laugh out loud and find yourself actually enjoying it. So in that way, it's like a wrestling B-movie. So bad it's good.So if you can find it for $1 like I did, pick it up, pop it in, and don't take it seriously.Oh and the Public enemy/Road Warriors match was alright."
5,Confession Dvd.,"I recent this item in very good condition.This story is set in a boys catholic boarding school. Religion plays a big part in this story. It focuses on how these boys are being brought up in a strict enviroment and the impact discipline when these boys do wrongful deeds.Chris Pine the main character, sells pornographic materials and alcohol which he keeps stored in his suitcase from this bedroom.One of his colleagues snitches on him and Chris Pine is hell bent on finding out who it was. When he dose find out, Chris decides to teach him a lesson and chases through the school yard in the night. The situation gets out of hand when accidently the culprit falls to his depth leaving Chris and his roommate to cover up the death.Eventhough it was an accident, Chris Pine knows no-one will believe him.An investigation follows where every student and members of staff are interviewed.This was very entertaining."
4,The message in this movie is very important,The reviewers below are right. The actors are pretty good. But I must add that the message of this movie is pretty impressive: father Michael is concerned about Luther's salvation even when the boy tried to frame him and to kill him. THAT'S REAL LOVE! That's what priesthood is all about. Buy or rent this movie.
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This B-Movie gem is the first leading role for Chris Pine, and it may be his best role to date. Pine plays Luther, the ""bad"" kid at Catholic school who can get you anything you want. He is however caught and along with his roommate, he is quickly booted out of school. Luther becomes obsessed with finding out who turned him in and when he does, the boy mysterious turns up dead. At a similar time, someone confesses to Priest Michael Kelly, who now knows who and why, but can't say anything. As a result Kelly quickly becomes a suspect leading up to a tremendous finally. Pine, best known as the ""new"" Captain Kirk was just fantastic. It's a shame this is a B-Movie, because if it had been a major release, he would have gained the recognition he deserves a lot sooner. This film is tremendous, I saw it as a modern day Shakespearean tragedy. It has life, death, religion, intrigue, and much more. It's a great film that fell way under the radar!"
2,not happy,"This battery does not work properly. It will not accept a full charge. Sometimes when it says it is fully charged, it will run out of charge and go dead as soon as you make the first call. It seems to charge properly with the AC adapter, but not with the car DC adapter."
4,At last - a european voice in the void,"+1 for distinctive ambient sound (so different from Lustmord / Roach &c.;)+1 for the best European space ambient I have heard since...well, ever!+1 for unpretentiousness - makes music to chill to+1 deliberately NOT a follow on of Secret Observatory - highly original-1 for too much analogue noodling on track #5 - TD did this better in 1973Bottom line: Compelling deep space ambient - looking forward to what's next!"
4,Better booklet...,"It's true that this cd has only 18 of the 20 tracks that are on the Repertoire release, but it has a better booklet. This one gives recording dates and other studie information lacking in the other booklet and also has better photos of the group. I have both cds!"
3,"Ok, but be careful",This works great for common lights but read all of the product details to verify that it will work with your lights.
1,screw in fluorescent bulb killer,"Works with fluorescent lights but not the kind you have. Heard a pop after installing this, one of my bulbs is flickering now and the motion sensor doesn't work. Energy saving devices like this is why the planet is doomed."
1,Waste of money,I installed this switch less than year ago and it no longer works. When it did work it would turn on when you were 30 feet away and had not use for it to come on; when you were in the room it wouldn't turn on unless you ran your hand over the sensor and then it would turn off just as you were reaching for something you needed. I think it enjoyed the tricks.
1,Not As Expected,I bought this because simular ones are installed in our office. These do not stay on long enough and tend to flash on and off as you move. I am looking for something that has a selection or timer to extend and not flash as often.
3,Leviton PR150-1LW worthy...,"Purchased 8 and only had trouble with the 1st on install. They're not bad for the price but their PIR 'response' time has a slight ~1/2 second delay even with minumum 'sensitivity' setting. Time-on feature adaquate. Still, other motion sensor products I've purchased/installed form Walmart & Lowes respond similarly. So price rules. Manufacturers should improve product but otherwise it does the job intended - just need a slight adjustment to appreciate their purpose."
3,"Works, but won't pick up a toddler.","We bought this so the light in the bathroom would go on automatically when our 3 year old entered the bathroom. While it does sense motion and work properly, she must be too small for it to pick her up. It does not go off when she enters and uses the bathroom. :("
1,Leviton PR150 NOT FOR Electronic Ballast,If you go to Leviton's website you will find that this Occupancy sensor is for use only with magnetic ballasts NOT electronic ballasts!
2,Not ball while it lasts,"I've had three of these switches in my garage. They all worked very well --- for about one year. After a year, the sensor fails and I am left with a manual on/off switch. If I wanted a manaul on/off switch this would not be my choice.I'm looking at motion sensor switches again because it is time to replace the third switch. Call me old fashioned, but I would expect a switch to last for at least five years. If you consider the cost of ownership to include annual replacement, this is not a bad product."
2,Not a great product,"I thought... all switches like this were the same. Not so.This switch does not allow for energy saving fluorescant bulbs to be used, nor does it stay on very long when in use. As an example: I go into the room looking for something and shortly thereafter, the light goes off even if I am moving around. Just what does motion detection mean?"
1,short life,"It's great idea to have the light go on as you enter the room, however we replaced that switch 3 times because it keeps breaking down after about 3 month and we could never get an explanation of why it stops working or any money back."
3,Works fine - in the right setting!,"We've used these switches in a mudroom and in a garage for years and have never had problems. A little bit of fiddling with the time and sensitivity controls, and you're set. However, the switches do not work well with compact fluorescent lights. And yes, the light may go off if you're in the room for a while and not moving, which is why there is a time-set control!"
1,Same poor experience as many others here,"Bought this at the local Home Depot. I should have checked here first. I installed this in my garage in order to control three fluorescent ceiling fixtures (the long rod type, not CFLs). As others have mentioned, the best part of this switch that works perfectly are the ON and OFF positions. AUTO gives all sorts of problems, ranging from inconsistent activation to flickering. The flickering is the most annoying part. In ""ON"" the lights are fine. In AUTO they flicker or blink every so often. I'm returning this ASAP."
1,shopping for another option.,"I have purchased 2 of these in 1 year and 2 weeks. The first one lasted 2 weeks but the hall HAD to have one. So I bought another. It lasted one year. Now I still have the need, but have lost the Leviton desire. Trouble is, nothing in this class at a reasonable price. I HOPE the next brand lasts a bit longer..."
1,Cheap switch with no help from Leviton,The little three way slider which changes the light from Off to Auto to On has a plastic post on the back that sticks into a small hole. After you move this back and forth a few times the plastic pole just breaks off. We keep a pen next to each one in our bedrooms to change it. Off is really required in a bedroom. Leviton doesn't have a part number for it and the only thing they suggest is for me to send the whole unit back for exchange. Given that I have 5 of these and 3 are broken in less than 12 months constantly returning these things just doesn't seem like a tenable response. I was hoping they could either give/sell me a bag of these cheap parts or maybe a metal one. This is terrible customer support. I'm going to switch them out for a better quality unit. Don't waste your time.
1,Bad marketing for this product,"This was basically the only indoor light sensor at our local home depot. So who knew that it was only for ""Magnetic Rapid Start"" fluorescent bulbs only? Read the fine print. Read the fine print. And who uses ""Magnetic Rapid Start"" fluorescent bulbs these days anyway?"
1,Poor Quality,"I found this device poorly made and should have returned it after opening the package and inspecting it. I needed the functionality though and decided to install it away. The short product life cycle proved me correct. After some initial fidaling I got it to work reliably ... but for only about three weeks. The motion sensor failed and the product was obviously uselesss without it. The manual slider switch also did not function mechanically. It did not align with the internal dip switch offering ""off"" or ""auto"" but not ""on"" due to restricted slide travel length on the bezel case. Leviton is an established and well known provider of electrical components. They should do a better job of source inspection from suppliers. Save your money- skip this product."
3,Product description is not accurate.,"Description is incorrect. Its a has a 150 degree sensing angle NOT 180 as described. Also, its white not ivory."
2,one I got run out in 5 months,"Installed the battery in my polar in April, by August it looked weak. In September it run out. Is that normal? I use the polar 1-2 a week for 3-4 hours. The original battery lasted 2 seasons."
5,Good battery,battery came without shipping charges and in a timely fashion. It powers my heart rate monitor as expected.
4,Finaly found it,I look every where locally and can't find this battery no matter how many stores I went into. People were starting to look at me like I got the wrong number for the battery. So far the battery works and it came fast in regular mail.
5,Lithium Battery CR2354,"Purchased battery from this supplier. When I installed it in my Polar bicycle computer, the battery was still low. I contacted the supplier and they sent me out a new battery promptly. Great and friendly service, very responsive and address the issue to my satisfaction. I would buy from this supplier again."
5,Feeling blue? Not after this one!,"This is the ultimate anti-depression CD. With a HIGH energy Broadway cast, it brings the music of Louis Jordan to an audience that may be too young to have ever known the master first hand. Jordan's sly lyrics are always enjoyable, and often humorous, and should never be taken seriously. The album has no age barriers: grandparents who were around when Jordan was will enjoy it as much as that gang of 12-year-old soccer players you're chauffeuring to practice."
5,Not boring,"Great CD, went to a club a week ago and heard a song that they played there on this CD ""Ssst . . Listen"". Best heard turned up!"
3,Mixed feelings about the paper holder,"I actually purchased this from Scrapbook.com, which was around the same price as Amazon. The idea of having the papers stored in this manner is great, because I find it easier to locate the papers I'm looking for, especially with the easy to label dividers. The fact that it is vertically stored, also seems to save space for me. However, I don't think the product is worth this price, as the paper holders are made out of a fairly cheap/ thin plastic and will not stand on their own as is shown in the picture. Also, if you happen to have the Ikea Expedit shelving, the holders will not fit between the shelves as they are too tall."
1,A total crappy movie!,1. Bad acting2. Thin Plot3. Poor Scriptsand the list goes on. Buy or rent it at your own peril.
1,Legend of Drunken Script-Writers,"Part Bible, part Golden Child, part Big Trouble in Little China, part SyFy channel FX, part tale of Oedipus. There is simply far too much going on, with far too many other possible comparisons.Somewhere in there is a story of a Khan ruler who sends henchmen to kill his nemesis and family. The result is a guy who can turn invisible helping to keep the newborn baby alive, and the khan's two sons (one evil, one benevolent) on a search for someone who can read a magical book (read: it's the girl). Throw in a few poorly rendered scenes from a Street Fighter video game, some kind of Chinese version of Rip Van Winkle, a tidal wave of bad acting, and possibly the worst script in cinema history. Script diarrhea.Avoid this unless you like sedative-free colonoscopies.Jason Elin"
1,"not even a ""B"" lister","Ohmigawd it's awful. So awful it's NOT funny. Every cliche, every lame plot twist, every limp character you can imagine, all stuffed into a thin ""plot"" and some damn rotten acting. It's like someone pulled all the bottom-rung characters from a lot of the really bad ""martial arts"" movies, and stuffed them all in here. There were non-asians as the oriental wizards, buffoons, idiots and oversized dumb hunks as the sidekicks, a blind magician, super-nasties on the side of evil, and even a female non-asian pirate. Pirates. In Cathay. Which apparently was some tiny mountain valley, where the pirate was really a good guy. So he died. And warring brothers. Let's not forget them. One good, one evil. And the good one loved the heroine. So he died. Coulda saved a lot of time by taking out all the hokey stuff, but then, there'd be only about fifteen minutes left. Woulda been an improvement. Watch it if you want- be prepared to laugh (or groan). You've been warned."
2,the cover was good!,it's beautifully shot.. the production design was great for the budget... but the film didn't hold my attention..
4,Good Movie for the Whole Family,"As a father with two boys, it is sometimes difficult for all of us to agree on a movie at our local movie rental store, much less for all of us to actually enjoy one. Until last night. There was something in it for everyone. My wife loved that there was a strong female lead charecter, the guys liked it for the action scenes and special effects (but not over the top violence or gore), and I thought the story played out well showing that one must work hard at anytihng we do and that good will usually triumph over evil. On top of that, for an independent film, I thought the musical score was outstanding. I felt the only low point was the character of the female ""bad-guy"". Her dialog was a tad scripted but other than that, I really thought this was a fine family film. Worth rental or purchase."
1,The worst movie ever made,"If they gave oscar for very very bad acting every one in this movie would win 10 of them,5 year olds could have made a better movie than this, do not wast your time on this one."
5,A RARE JEWEL!,"A rare jewel is a beautifully written page-turner that has a captivating story and is unpredictable. In the Midst of Darkness, by Colleen Rice, is most definitely a rare jewel. Ireland (I MUST visit!), the characters and their struggles against poverty and prejudice over several generations came alive for me and I was transported. The well-balanced insight into the hearts and minds of the oppressors as well as the oppressed was refreshing too. I would highly recommend this book to all and plan to keep it in my collection and treasure it. Thank you Colleen Rice!"
5,Authentic and gripping,"I'm usually not a big fan of historical novels, but I received this book as a gift and was completely swept into the drama of these four compelling characters. Even though I have no Irish blood, the story of Reanna, Seamus, Siobhan and Donald had a transcendent quality: It was about ordinary women and men--a teacher, a hatmaker, etc.--caught up in a historical moment that they could not have foreseen or controlled. It makes me think of all those stories we've read about people working at the World Trade Center bombing on Sept. 11--that precious intersection of daily life with epic history. Even 200 years after the Irish Revolution, this book feels so immediate in Rice's able hands. She is a talented storyteller who created characters I cared about, and the historical backdrop just made it richer for me."
4,"Great Show, Even Better Extras",It can't top the first season but It's definatly a great season and the widescreen view is awesome. The extras are much better than last year's. Basically I was in the Bahamas and It was a hard desicion whether i wanted to go dance and drink or go to the hotel room and watch the show on my computer.
5,Obsessed,"Season 2 of the OC is as incredible as the first. This is a show about teenage life in Newport Beach Calafornia. There are many moments when you forget the characters are in high school due to mature content. However, the series is captivating and addictive."
3,season 1 was hard to follow,"i love, love the oc, never wwatched it on tv, but i bought season one and i was hooked, this is an amazing show, but i have to say season two was a bit boring, still entertaining but,the stories were a bit weak in comparison to season one, im hoping season 3 will be better, im still a fan though, those families are just too cute for words, i love the drama!! and how cute is seth cohen????? he cracks me up, lol!!!"
5,As Usual OC Rocks!,"We love the OC. I am forty years old and never miss an episode! Bought this set as a birthday present for my friend's daughter... But secretly I wish it were for me. We loved the ""out-takes."" It's a lot of fun watching actors make mistakes. It shows they are human. We have bought every sound track and both prior dvd season sets! We watch during the summer so we don't miss a week of the O.C!"
1,NOT RECIEVED,I NEVER RECIEVED MY DVD SET. TOOK MY MONEY AND NEVER SENT MERCHANDISE. TRIED TO CONTACT SELLER AND THEY NEVER GOT BACK TO ME.
1,Not worth it.,"This Season 2 set of DVDs is miles away from the quality exhibited in Season 1. Having seen the episodes when they originally aired, I have no need to torture myself with them again. Out of 24 episodes, I can count on one hand the episodes worth watching again -- a huge difference from my Season 1 set, where every episode has at least one redeeming virtue.Bottom line? Although it's a hotly debated issue, in my opinion, Season 2 is just not worth it."
2,Dissapointing second season with some good moments,Overall I found the season to be a big bore. I am not a hugh fan and season 1 was pretty good but not great but I had to watch this season and will continue to watch the other season's. The season started good but went downhill fast becouse nothing happend you can miss all season adn it will be right were you left off. There are good moments like the last few episodes were really good. Overall not a great second season.
2,Not nearly as good as season 1,"I am the biggest O.C. fan ever, I made my college schedule so that i'd be able to watch the O.C. on Thursday nights, but I have the say that season 2 was a real disappointment. Not only did they ruin Kirsten and Sandy's relationship, but they also got rid of Jimmy, and Kaleb died. All the new characters they introduced sucked, and they didn't stick around very long. Mischa Barton needs to take acting lessons, because there is more to being a good actress than the ability to cry on command. Summer and Seth got annoying, and Ryan's totally different than he was in the first season. Oh and whatever happened to Marissa's sister Kaitlin, don't they get breaks at boarding school. This was a really good show and I hope the writers can get there act together for season 3, but in the mean time don't waste your money on this DVD, buy the One Tree Hill season 2 DVD instead."
1,i can sum this season up in one word...CRAP,"the first season was amazing. It took you on a roller coaster ride of emotions ending in the most heart breaking, torturing, cliffhanger, ever.that brings me to season two. i knew it was going down hill when1. the second ryan got back him and marissa didn't get back together2. summer got a new boyfriend zack, that was basically a hotter version of seth3. sandy and kirsten almost fought ever episode.ALL OF THIS LED TO THE BIGGIEST REASON WHY THIS SEASON IS CRAPMARISSA TURNS GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If she's going to be gay thats fine, if she really is, BUT SHE""S NOT. This was nothing more than a ratings ploy.DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD, instead buy ONE TREE HILL"
5,OC Season 2,"The product came in a timely fashion and was in perfect, unused condition. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,The O.C. Season 2......DUMB,"The O.C was like my favorite show during it's first season. Season 2, oh boy. How does a show go from being so grood to so bad. First of all Season 1 left in a place that had very little story to build off of in the new season. The O.C. Season 2 was just plaine boring, dumb, and really dissapointing. Despite having a great cast the scripts were just not up to the O.C. standard. I will give the O.C. some credit, the had lesbians, nice. Over all the season sucked. It was way to predictable, and had no twists that left you oh my god. The Cliffhanger wasn't even that good. I say don't waste your money on season 2. It is because of this that I will not be watching next year. How did the O.C. become one of the most boring shows on televison in less than half a season."
1,Over Acting Is Not A Good Thing.,This show should have been canceled faster than My So Called Life. This has to be Foxes desparation for another 90210 or Melrose Place. It won't happen with this show. The storylines are rip right off a day time soap and acted out the worst. Can anybody answer this....Why do the parents look younger than the kids (except Adam Brody). Th OC should be pulled if for nothing else bad acting.
1,IGNORANT,I dont want to see these yuppie kids on this ignorant TV show. This is crap. How can you stand to watch this garbage?
2,Just a dumb fake California series,"You call this television? This is a horrible show. This show made a REAL true teen series be cancelled. Anyone remember LIFE AS WE KNOW IT? LAWKI is wayyyy better than this, a so-called television show. The O.C. might have hot guys, I agree, but I would not watch just to watch Mischa Barton make out with a girl. The only good thing about this show is all the cast except Mischa Barton. Mischa Barton is fake also. I like Rachel Bilson and Adam Brody though. They are a cute couple. If you like fake shows, buy this, but if you hate fake California tv shows, make sure you don't buy."
5,season 2 is even better,"i love the o.c.and i love that with the dvd's, you can watch the show commercial-free.the only bad thing about this set is that i spend too much time sitting in front of the tv because i can't quit watching!!"
3,Good...but bad..,"The plastic case pieces that hold the discs in were all broken, but honestly I didn't care because the discs were fine and still play, which is all I wanted! For others it might be a big deal, but I'm not really collecting the box sets so..."
4,Addicted!,I find this show completely addicting. The second season does not disappoint- the characters are even more gorgeous and the drama always provides a nice escape from reality. My only complaint is that Ryan's BA attitude seems to have disappeared. But he's still cute!
5,O.C. Second Season,"This came in new condition, in plastic wrap and so far its been working great! Its awesome i was able to buy this and catch up on a show i used to love!"
4,A Solid Show,Great To Watch and very addictive. This season wasn't as good as the first but the girls are hot and it's solid entertainment.
4,Second season slump?,"The second season of the O.C. attempts to build on the first while forcing its viewers not to take every character at face value. Ryan becomes a ""good boy"" while Marissa has a fling with a girl, Sandy and Kirsten become the antithesis of the perfect couple, and Julie shows she has more depth than her perfectly crafted facade admits. Sometimes these changes work. It's facinating to watch Marissa navigate through her bourgeoning sexuality and rebellion, and Sandy and Kirsten's marriage problems make the adults much more interesting than they ever have been. However, Ryan's new good boy routine makes him lose most of his appeal, and many of the plot lines were either dropped between seasons or changed in a way that makes them completely unbelievable. It's still fun, and I'm still buying it, but if you're debating between the first two seasons, I would definitely go for season 1."
4,The OC,Great series that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for things to happen between Marissa and Ryan.
5,Just as good as the first season!,"I'm a huge fan of the O.C., and I have to disagree with reviewers who say the first season was better. They are both great! The continuation of the witty, humorous and also dramatic stories are a great follow-up to season 1. I actually think the 2nd season got even funnier.The characters continue to be great, although there's the introduction of a few new ones which obviously failed, because by the end of the season, they are all gone. (Except for Alex, bring her back!)It's definitely worth a spot in your DVD collection!"
4,Such a cute show!,"I first began watching the O.C. because of the songs I knew featured in the series.Then it was it, I was hooked.My opinion on season 2 is very clear: it's great!The most believable characters are Kirsten & Marissa. However, the others tend to parody themselves. I think it's cute though...The best storylines have been, I think,- The Summer/Seth on & off again...- The character of Alex- Kirsten's drinking problemThe worst:- Lindsay- Zach- RebeccaThe best songs in this season:- Non-Photo Blue & Fortress: Pinback- Eve, the apple of my eye: Bell X1- you got me all wrong: Dios Malos- Somersault: Zero 7- the reason why & worn me down : Rachael Yamagata- baby you should know: joy zipperETC...I have to say that this show is so glam and heart-warming, it just gets to you. Let's just hope season 3 will bring us more crazy stories that include Julie Cooper or Summer ( the funny ones), or Seth & Sandy (the annoyingly cute ones), or Kirsten/Ryan/Marissa (the dramatic ones)Keep up the good work!"
1,Total garbage,"I don't even know where to begin to describe how crappy this show is. It's about a bunch of rich and spoiled kids running around with their problems and creating even more drama ahead of them. This is just like Laguna Beach, except this is not reality TV. All they do is lounge around each others pool, drink and argue who should date who and who dumped who. BORING AND POINTLESS."
2,why,"I love the o.c but am so dissapointed that the u.s version has 7 disks where as the u.k only has 6 some people might say i can buy the u.s one but after finding out my dvd player doesnt play region 1 dvds i'm so torn up, why couldnt they relase the u.k version with 7 disks too big let down... Looks like i'll have to go buy a new dvd player :("
2,Molto bene!,"Veramente bene, ragazzi!Il pacco è arrivato molto prima del previsto senza spendere tanto. Grazie mille."
5,Teaberry plant,I couldn't believe how easy it was to find and grow this lovely plant. I have had no issues at all with it and it has been very hardy since the purchase. The aroma and sheer nostalgic joy that this plant has given me is more than worth the price. I need to get one for the office too.
4,dogs,dogs and plants don't mix. need a new plant. dogs and plants don't mix. need a new plant. new plant
5,"Bright, energy saving and instantly on!","Great replacement light suitable for kitchen, mud room, powder room etc. Not too ornate but the brushed nickel adds a little sparkle where usually a utility look would reside. The unit comes with the one bulb you need (a looped flourescent) and the base was easy to install with lots of lengthy wiring included.It's a nice size and comes on instantly - no warm up or flickering, so fills our laundry room with a bright, bluey white hue. It's not a mellow cast so wouldn't suit a room you spend relaxing time in, but it's really not designed for that.The globe is heavy duty too and is thick and opaque, making the unit easy on the eye whilst giving off a great omni amount of light.Packaging was surprisingly robust so it'll arrive safe and you can't argue with the price!"
3,looks nice but difficult to install,"I'm happy with the light now that it's up. The light it gives off is excellent; however, it was extremely time consuming and difficult to install. I would not do it again."
4,Lil rob is definitly still smokin!,eh if you like lil rob then you'll like his new album still smokin
4,Ready for Marriage,"This was the first novel by Debbie Macomber I read. It is engaging and entertaining, easy to read. I became a fan of Ms Macomber. This is one of those novels that leave you feeling good. I would read it again."
3,Very disappointed,Debbie Macomber is a wonderful writer and most of her novels are easy reads that allow you to escape. This is not as good as her newer works but is okay for mindless entertainment.
3,Not one of Macomber's best,"This was a bit of a chess match, with characters advancing and retreating like mad. I got to a point where the misunderstandings made me want to sit them all down and say, ""Look. She still likes him, he still likes her. They've had hurt feelings in the past, what with her being noble and him being jilted. Patch it up, already!"" The heroine was a bit too noble for my taste. And I thought the rebound fiance' she was dating was about as dull as she deserved. Fortunately, this author can and does do better."
4,Once in a Lifetime Gathering of Country Queens,"This program deserves ten stars but this tape is getting only four because this two-hour CBS special from 1993 has been cut in half and issued on two separate tapes. Way better than the recent A&E documentary HAIRDOS AND HEARTACHES on the same subject (women in country music history) in part because so many more singers from all eras are interviewed here and this one features music performances performed especially for the show including an awesome all-star performance of Mary Chapin Carpenter's ""The Hard Way"" sung by Carpenter, Wynona, Trisha Yearwood, Tammy Wynette, Emmylou Harris, Kathy Mattea, Pam Tillis, and others and including backup chorus of dozens of historic country divas including Kitty Wells, Patsy Montana, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, Jeannie C. Riley, Lynn Anderson, Wanda Jackson, and many others. Here's hoping this program will find it's way to DVD in full - and hopefully with many extras."
5,Long Overdue Critique,"For too long a time have the faithful been silent, bowing to the ever-present dictum ""pray, pay and obey"". A revolution has begun and it is being conducted by all segments of the Church - laity, clerical and hierarchy. Dr Jim Muller, president of the Voice of the Faithful (of which my wife and I are members), is leading this revolution.I have just finished reading, for the second time, ""Keep the Faith, Change the Church"" and warmly recommend it to all who would follow Jesus - who said ""Suffer the little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven."""
4,"Great little pan, right price","This company serves up a solid line of saucepans that have found their way into the kitchens of master chefs such as Julia Child, Renee Behnke and the like. It's the right weight, the right durability and THE RIGHT PRICE to do much of the every day cooking tasks done in most kitchens. While not much to look at, this saucepan is fully qualified to get the heavy jobs done. I say take the money you save on this great little saucepan and use it to buy some fabulous knives."
1,This Lamp Is A Piece Of Junk,"The box arrived damaged and as a result the shade was damaged slightly, but what really ticked me off is that the pad at the base of the lamp which is supposed to protect your furniture from the metal was too small for the lamp and arrived inside of the base where it protects nothing from anything. Also the metal base itself was warped which causes the lamp to rock back and forth when you touch it.Fortunately the lamp was intended for a non-critical area so I'll keep it, but I promise you that I'll NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ORE INTERNATIONAL again!"
3,BETTER SELECTIONS NEEDED,THIS CD WAS GOOD OVERALL BUT FOR A GREATEST HITS PACKAGE A BETTER SELECTION OF MATERIAL COULD HAVE BEEN OFFERED. THE GROUP DID A WEALTH OF GREAT MATERIAL ON THE CHESS LABEL. THE SONGS OF THIS CD WAS ENJOYABLE AND IAM GLAD THAT THEY ARE BEING OFFERED ON CD.
4,CLOSE,4 stars just because it's The Violinaires. But so much of their material is unavailable that it's a shame. Why can't we have 'Three Pictures of The Lord' 'Dhe Used To Hold Me' and the full version of Coming Up Through The Years'? Where is 'Memories'? We want our Violinaires and we don't care who knows it. Somebody help.
1,C'mon now...,"I 've saw this group live many times as a child. My uncle adored them. This is a terrible collection!! Where is ""Mother Used to Hold me""? ""Old Time Religion""? ""It Will All Be Over Afterwhile""? and ""Memories""? not to mention loads more..This collection does this great and HISTORIC group NO justice at all!!"
2,Best of the Violinaires,"I have become a great fan of the Violinaires. Their music is so inspiring. However, I cannot find much of their earlier selections, especially on CD. I believe those are their best. The song I am particularly interested in is the Violinaires recorded version of Praise Him. This song is one of their best. The live version is available and is quite good. The recorded version is a classic."
2,I have better CD's,"Not the coolest CD i have in my collection, thought i needed it to complete my set of Heavy D's"
5,Excellent Suspense Film,"This independent suspense movie is certainly worth seeing. The story is tense, the acting is strong, and the quality is equal to any film. And, if you are a fan of Tiffany Shepis, as I am, you will enjoy her appearances throughout. This is probably the best of director Patrick Roddy's movies (so far)."
3,Cca673,"The video playback doesnt work if installed on the vrx765vd . iPhone works great controlled thru the deck , after i installed it it made a squealing noise."
4,Really good.,"I needed a cord like this for my dorm room. When I saw this one I was very suprised at how inexpensive it was, so I thought what the heck, I'll try it. It came in the mail about a week later. Somewhat to my suprise it worked perfectly! I use it to connect my iPhone to my stereo. The only problem I have with it is that the end that plugs into the headphone jack is somewhat limited. I have a case on my iPhone and it is very difficlut to get it all the way plugged in. But other than that it works great and does exactly what it is advertised to do."
2,3.5mm jack loose,"The 3.5mm jack is very loose in the two headphone sockets I have tried, which leads to to it pulling out very easily. It's not very suitable if the source or destination are going to be moved at all. Otherwise the cable and RCA jacks seem fine."
4,These cables are fine but they do NOT work when connecting...,my Android phone to my stereo. For some reason they only play a portion of the audio playback. I could hear music but no lyrics during songs.
4,Standard Cable,"Standard cables, do what they should. I wish the phono connector was smaller or at a 90 degree angle....but it wasn't falsely advertised."
2,Wrong,Does not work with I phone!!!Does not work with I phone!!!Does not work with I phone!!!Does not work with I phone!!!
1,More false advertising??,"I grabbed this cable because it was cheap and I figured it would do the job. It works just fine for connecting my MP3 player to my stereo. I chose this cable over other cables because the image shows a rubber stopper piece that keeps the cable together at the Y where it splits in two. What bothers me most is that the cable they sent me doesn't have the rubber stopper. Not a big deal, but I find that over time these cables split further and further.In reality, it's not that big of a deal, so I would have given it more stars, except that other people also seem to be buying this for specific features (gold plating) and people aren't getting what they're being advertised. One customer image, as well as the actual product image, shows the rubber stopper. Mine is gold plated...unlike the customer image.Bottom line, it's a crap shoot. You might get the features you want and you might not, but it'll still play your audio."
5,A refreshing and spiritual work,"Like other reviewers here, I too have read very many books about the search for the truth. The frustrating thing is that whilst many couch the search for the truth in very dramatic terms and may be mentally interesting, they rarely offer any constructive suggestions as to how to actually find it.Mr de Kalbermatten has managed to both encapsulate a huge amount of knowledge into a very short space and also give very useful suggestions to the reader as to how to actully do something for themselves. I can assure you that what Mr de Kalbermatten suggests does seem to work. The results are very refreshing and relaxing without having to do anything or learn any complex system of belief.If you are looking for the meaning behind everything and have found past reading fascinating but ultimately unsatisfying, you will absolutely love this book."
5,Get a Copy NOW,"Gregoire De Kalbermatten lays out the spiritual and history perspective of mankind's evolution.The book is well written and easy to read, provides a truly deep insight into the human condition, and offers practical solutions for the direction of humanity.The book is for everyone who has ever asked the question ""what is this life all about / why am I here"""
5,Manfred T.,"I've read this book sevaral times and always found new things to chew on ;-). The author clearly describes not only the decadence of the western society but clearly states the zeitgeist of our whole modern world. Everybody who just looks a little bit deeper under the surface, sees that the status and mind of the world isn't in good shape, facing destruction on every level, from global down to personal, effecting every human being in one way or an other.A possible solution to all this is the way the author explains. It's nothing new of course, basically stating - change the world by changing yourself - but why should truth be something new, it always has been the same and will be. Circumstances are changing, as clearly described in ""The Third Advent"", relating the ""story"" back in history as far as 6000 years.An amazing book altogether."
3,Classic toddler game,"I purchased this version of Candyland because I didn't like the graphics of the newer Candyland games. However, I didn't realize that the playing board that comes in the metal tin would be folded up so small, making the game board difficult to lie flat for play. I enjoy the durability of the box and pieces, but probably would have purchased a different version with a board that only splits once down the middle. Otherwise, my 3 yr-old daughter loves to play this game with mom and dad and at Grandma's house. Also, the play in this version can be a little long and tedious, so I agree with other reviewers who suggest modifying the rules and stacking the deck to keep play shorter!"
1,Sizing misleading,"Though these moccassins are nice, they do not fit according to American shoe sizes. My husband needs a 13 however these are only a 12 according to our sizing standards."
5,Nice Seat,Nice seat the whole thing is made of plastic and thecushions are removable and replaceable. It sits lower than myprevious seat but I plan to add a treated wood block to raise it upa couple of inches.
1,A Redundant Book,"There already was a definitive book on the Charlie Chan movies, so I wondered what the rationale could possibly be for putting out another one. And now, having read this new book, I'm still wondering what the rationale was. That list of killers must be the raison d'etre because there's precious little else here--certainly not a great deal of critical insight or writing talent."
5,Top of the line,"With years of only one film guide, the error-filled Hanke book, it is great to find a book that does it right. It is evaluative, complete and well-written. The breathrough with new information on the Cuban and Mexican Chan films is significant. If you like Charlie Chan, this is the book for you."
1,Fannishness and Bean-Counting,"For readers interested in a poorly written random collection of facts, this is probably THE Charlie Chan film book to have. If you want to ruin the films' mystery elements, this is definitely the book to have, since the author has bizarrely decided to tell the reader the identity of the killer in a wrong-headed appendix. But in all this something is missing. What could it be? The true sense of the films themselves perhaps? A degree of style? Yes, that's what I'm missing here. This is the well-intentioned work of a fan who seems to think that amassing enough facts is an adequate substitute for understanding the films themselves. It isn't. Thank you so much, but no thank you."
1,Pretty Poor and Pretty Derivative,"This book is a lot of things--very few of them good.I decided to give it a try when I heard it was generating some kind of controversy as concerns whether it or the old CHARLIE CHAN AT THE MOVIES is the better book. Let me put it this way, I'm glad I was able to borrow the new book. Need I say more?"
5,"Best book on Chan ever written--most comprehensive, witty.","Mitchell handles each Chan film with great expertise. Even though book is organized alphabetically (chronologically would have been better), the author is astute enough to place each film in its own studio and cinematic context. Really excellent plot outlines and critical commentary make this a book worth buying. Moreover, Mitchell includes the missing Chan films as well as all the ""Chan aphorisms"" used throughout the film series. It is the best, most authoritative book I've ever read on the Chinese detective. Mitchell's critical ability and perception is peerless. Try it! You'll like it."
2,Don't buy this book if you need real information!,"While this book boasts excellent print qualities, along with top notch photo reproduction, it lacks any real information of substance. If you are looking for a book to help you learn the ins and outs of medium format, keep looking. It will not help you with the intricacies of lighting, composing for medium format vs. 35mm, or any other ""important"" information for the neophyte medium format photographer. I was looking for this type of book, and I was sorely disappointed after reading this title in one evening. Please Mr. Ericksenn, try again."
4,Excellent reference for the person considering medium format,This is an excellent book for the novice considering moving to medium format. Goes in to detail on available options in this format. Has some good tips and tricks. Emphasis on high end equipment like Rollei and Hasselblad. Next to nothing on Mamiya. Not a must for those already familiar with medium format equipment.
3,An initial look at Medium Format,"This is a good reference and primer for those wishing to explore the medium format world of photography. The logic and language of Ericksenn is easy to read and understand. It is obvious from his work shown, that he is a professional and earnest about this topic. Most serious photographers would not find this text challenging or ""new"" enough, but a novice may. Some helpful references are the scenics pictured, taken with different lenses and film sizes to demonstrate perspectives etc. Most of the information about the cameras discussed is basically correct, but much of it is dated as of this writing. Some brands of equipment are largely ignored. I found this book ""okay"", but then I have been deep into this hobby for decades."
3,"Not too bad, but very good for beginners","Lief Ericksenn has created an interesting introduction to the medium format field. Many of his pictures are excellent - especially those centering around the space program. The text is a little light, possibly designed for a beginner like myself. Still, there is a great deal of information about composition, darkroom and manufacturers. Perhaps an update to the text is in order. However, considering the number of books written on the subject, I would consider this a must-have for those interested in MF photography."
2,Out of Date,"Hard to believe this book's still in print. The author apparently died before the book was published in 1991, and it badly needs updating as the MF camera information dates from that era. Nothing on recent MF cameras, digital, Russian Kievs, etc.It's pretty light in the information department as well. A casual review of camera models and the author's use of a few of them on a trip here and there do not make for an intensive education in the field of medium-format photography."
3,Medicore,Between digital and lack of acknowledgement of Soviet equipment I found this book medicore in the classes I taught. Wish I'd saved the money for a new camera
1,"I have seen worse, well this is worse, teribul movie","there are no words for this movie, if you like much bloodgo for it, but it has no tale,"
4,"A fun story for children, good for young girls","Jody and her family get to spend a year sailing around the world, studying dolphins. For Jody this is the chance of a lifetime. Jody loves dolphins.Jody records her struggles with an unexpected guest, the excitement of seeing a dolphin, and the normally daily stuff of being at sea. The story moves along quickly, and is pleasant enough.The stock characters were a bit disappointing. Jody's parents are scientists, and are good down to earth people. The businessmen who are largely sponsoring the trip send along a ""clueless, detached scientist."" It was mildly funny how the scientist pokes a minor hole in Jody's idealist picture of dolphins. We also get a ""spoiled princess"" who makes life challenging for Jody.All in all it is a fun story that most young girls will enjoy."
3,Enjoyed the first 3/4 of it ...,An Earl and a tavern maid. I kept forgetting their backgrounds during the story. It took place mostly on board ship. Then they docked -- the rest lacked excitement. Especially when the hero is wounded so severly. It was sad ... and went downhill after that.
1,"Boring, boring, boring","This book was just glum and boring. The characters were so wretched all the time. Apparently, Kat Martin does not know how to write with any wit or humor. I only got half way through the book and just couldn't stand all the ""boo-hooing"" the characters did. The style of this book reminds me very much of Brenda Joyce's recent works, or rather, poor works."
4,"Brandy, you're a fine girl ...",A very good historical by one of my favorite authors based on one of my favorite songs from back when... This is a wonderful book that I couldn't put down for the simple reason that I wanted to get to that moment when Marcus realized what a clod he was. I'd have liked to see him realize that earlier. One hell of a heroine! All around good job!
3,Pales in comparison to her earlier works,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Alas, it plodded along and I was not even given the chance to guess the culprit of the sabotage; like other authors these days (Krentz comes to mind), Martin apparently thinks we can't figure this stuff out. But as far as Brandy and Marcus, yawn. Ho hum. Brandy has too much spunk to be the long suffering heroine, and Marcus has too much dignity to become the jerk he does. The changes in the characters are unrealistic, as are the shipboard scenes (Brandy skulking to the hold with some chicken? Give me a break). Read it for an afternoon of light romance, but it's not a keeper."
5,"High adventure, moving romance","This was a fabulous story, beautifully told by an author who knows why we read romance. I picked this up at the Safeway and never did get around to fixing dinner. Treat yourself to this book."
5,Wonderful love story,"Kat Martin has written another great romance!In 1803 Charleston, tavern maid Brandy wants some adventure so she stows away on Marcus Delaine's ship to Nassau. Brandy has secretly been in love with Marcus since she was 9 years old. During the ""adventure"" Brandy and Marcus fall in love, although Marcus is reluctant to admit his love for Brandy.After the voyage Marcus returns Brandy to Charleston and leaves for China. During the fateful voyage, the ship is sabotaged and Marcus is hurt very badly. Unable to walk, Marcus returns to England an angry and broken man.Brandy hears of the troubles and immediately goes to England. Through love and determination, Marcus learns to walk again although he leaves Brandy once again to a life at sea.I'll stop here so I don't give all the story away. This is an excellent book and highly recommended."
4,Practical application,"Breakaway is a very readable book, written in an open, honest and straight-forward style. The book provided me with new insights into speed to performance that I have been able to successfully apply in business operations performance improvement. Of key importance is the identification of four phases in the ""real-world"" learning process, with emphasis on the often overlooked aspect of accelerating the accumulation of experience."
5,"A wonderful, durable pop-up book","I bought this book as a replacement for our very old, very used one.My grandson loves this book. We have read it many, many times. The pop-ups are two-sided, so you can read the book one way, turn it around and read it the other. There are so many things to look at and study and move. I enjoy it almost as much as he does."
2,An unrealistic portrayal of an american busy town,"A very uninspiring book. I had a hard time following the storyline and if it wasn't for the popups, I would not have understood the plot at all. Richard Scarry creates a world that is not only busy, but chaotic. I give this book an F."
3,What would Jesus do?,"The Sixth Jar, written by Richard Langsdale, argues the same notion as Dan Brown did with the DaVinci Code. From Jesus' human side, Langsdale creates a plot, where Jesus has sexual and sole mate needs. These needs are culminated in his relationship with Mary Magdalene, with whom he has a sexual relationship, enters into a covenant (marriage), and, after Jesus' ascension, he discovers she is pregnant with his child. I was left with several questions: What is sin? Does Jesus having a sexual relationship with a womandiminish the view of him as lord? Would the child from their union, have divinity qualities that would pass from generation to generation? The connection with the Sixth Jar is the notion that we need to have that incredible, intimate relationship with another human being -- the sole-mate thing, even Jesus. It's a good read, and as can be imagined quite controversial for the early 70s. Richard Langsdale was a Lutheran pastor."
3,Better then expected,"While not surprised that Jay Baruchel has delivered another good comedy i was surprised by just how much i enjoyed the friends dynamic amongst JB and TJ Miller as well as Nate Torrence and Mike Vogel. Besides the female perhaps being better off played as English character since she was pretty stilted and obviously not American, and a few holes in the storyline this was a really enjoyable well paced and VERY funny movie."
4,One of the most well done romantic comedies ever,"I really liked this movie. It has all the right elements for an awesome romantic comedy. I also really like Jay Baruchel acting skills. He plays the geeky guy role very well and I believe this his first, main star movie role in his career.The story line is basic, 1 hot girl and 1 geeky guy end up together in the end. But before that happens, the geeky guy will help the hot girl with a problem. The problem in this movie is that the hot girl has a low-self esteem. I don't know any movie that has used that idea before and is surprising and fresh to see.There are plenty of jokes here, but they are mostly cheesy dumb jokes. Some people don't like those things, but I didn't mind it. I always watch stupid comedies as well, so those kind of jokes don't bother me much.Everyone should give this movie a chance and watch it. It really has something for everyone."
5,Awesome movie...very funny!,"I loved this movie and have now passed the DVD around in my office and everyone there loved it too! Some of the moments are just too funny and unforgettable! Definitely an ADULT movie though, not for young eyes or ears at all!!"
5,"Not usually my cup of tea, but...","I really enjoyed this movie. I am 58 years old, so I am REALLY not the targeted demographic for this film. I thought the comedy was great and the main character sympathetic and likeable. I recommended this film to my 25 year old son and he enjoyed it also. Nice find."
3,"Worth a rental, not a keeper though","Funny, but not overly memorable. Definitely worth a rental, but I'd pass on the purchase."
2,How realistic!,"The idea of a group of silly and awkward friends was well presented in ""40 year old virgin"", but how many times must we plow the same worn out idea? It is getting boring and annoying. In this movie a group of annoying guys are friends, and the least attractive among them falls in love with a very pretty inside out girl. Like that happens in real life, usually guys fall for bad girls and vice versa!Fantasy is not a problem, if it wasn't for terribly annoying scenes that are not funny at all. See for yourself or save the time and money and don't!"
5,Suprisingly funny,I came across this on cable a couple months ago and was surprised at how funny this was. Since then my channel surfing comes to a halt when I see this is on. There are some really funny scenes.
4,Funnier than it gets credit for.,"I really don't understand why this movie isn't more popular than it is. It's got a top notch comedic cast,who might not be well known A list actors but are certainly recognizable and you can just tell they were allowed to bring their best in the makiing of this movie. The script might be a bit obvious in terms of structure but there is enough chemistry in the performaces and originality in the comedic bits that it makes it easy to forget you know exactly how this movie will end going in. What I like best about this movie is that you can really tell the actors were allowed a lot of opportunity to improvise different takes of a line otr a scene in order to really take advantage of the acting talent assembled. I think this is a great movie that is drastically underrated and anyone who is looking for a nice well paced, well written, well directed and well acted comedy will appreciate this film."
5,Great Movie,"I purchased this movie for my son for Christmas. It came in time, very fast service. Funny movie. Will purchase from Amazon again."
4,Predictable but still entertaining.,I took my teenage daughters to see this and it was better than I thought it would be. I think they could do without using the F*word all the time. Yes it is a predictable romantic comedy but nowadays aren't most of them??!?! If you don't take it to serious and just want to kill an hour and half then this movie is worth seeing.
3,Not worth the rental,"I didn't expect this to be brilliant or anything, but by the reviews I hoped for a good laugh and a decent time. It's not a good movie.The problem is it's a cheap imitation of other similar movies, namely Something About Mary, Say Anything etc. The core problem is the guy character is just not charming nor really likeable. The ""trick"" in movies like this is to have a guy who is semi good looking but very likeable. This guy isn't attractive at all, and his lame personality doesn't overcome it.And this is a guy writing this, there's just no chemistry. Don't watch. Move on."
2,Disappointment,"Formulaic, brain-dead Judeo-liberal exploitation flick. Basically the same Jewish-nerd-gets-the-hot-white-girl movie that inbred Hollywood has been turning out non-stop since the 1960's. Besides being terribly insulting to and exploitative of white women, this is a very tired, very ethnocentric genre, and this movie itself is at the tail end of the current crop of these crude, Judeocentric Seth Rogenesque movies.Skip this one and send Hollywood a message that good writing is more important than F-bombs and hot chicks in underwear."
5,DVD,"The dvd ""She's Out of My League"" arrived in a reasonable amount of time and played on my dvd player. Unfortunately for me, not knowing the content or looking at the rating (which should be R), my granddaughter of ten was with me and we had to stop watching it early because of sexual content. I will watch it later to see if it really is as funny as I have heard."
1,Ripped Off!!!!,"I ordered this movie a few weeks ago and i finally got to open it, and when i did, the wrong movie was inside. It was some movie ive never heard of in the box. Completely ripped off!!!!"
2,Mediocre Movie at best,Started watching this the other night and it got more and more painful as I watched. Really not much more than just a garbage romantic comedy. The plot and dialogue are poor.... even the main girl isn't THAT hot ;)
3,OK,It was an alright movie. I picked it up on a gamble because I was not sure. Had funny moments in it but it was not great.
5,"Charming Rom Com, New Star in Jay Baruchel","This was a funny romantic comedy. Definitely not realistic, but the cast and writing was charming enough to overlook the over-the-top scenarios. Jay Baruchel is funny and earnest. I predict he will be huge soon."
4,Funny,"Perfectly reviewed in one word (funny) but, I'll add a few more for added information. Loser guy hooks up with hot girl and from then on it's a constant battle for them to make it work. A Funny romantic comedy with great banter.Acting - 4 out of 5Plot - 3 out of 5 - I never wanted to turn it offOriginality - 4 out of 5 (some of the jokes were very odd and unexpected)"
3,FUNNIER THAN I EXPECTED,"What happens when a very ordinary, geeky, awkward guy lands a dream girl? What's going on? And what to do about all the comments, envy and social stress that comes with the territory? This comedy is a notch above the raunchy oeuvre the movie suggests. It's not so much about ""love conquers all"" as it is about how to keep the yapping dogs at bay. Alice Eve is perky and beautiful as the girl and Jay Baruchel has fun as her lucky puppy."
5,"Invitation to Presence, A Guide to Spiritual Disciplines",An Invitaion to Presence is just that an opportunity to experience the process of the presence of God. It is a great introduction to the practice of meditation and contemplation. It has a leader guide that enables it to be used in a group setting but of course is good to study individually. The cross references and resources shared give opporunity to move additionally in the process as one grows and wants to open more and more to knowing the heart of God.
5,Great Multi,"This multivitamin has done amazing things. I feel better, my body functions better, my period cramps are almost gone. I do take an additional supplement with calcium/magnesium and vitamin D since this is quite low. For the price, these are an amazing value!"
5,helpful in understanding TEC controversies today,"Episcopalians trying to reach an understanding of theological issues in the American church today might find this study very enlightening, as I do. I find Bp Marshall's careful and thorough use of available documents very persuasive in his estimate of Seabury's character and churchmanship. There was no ""Jesus seminar"" in Seabury's day, but there were non-Trinitarian clergy in the early American church who tried to make the liturgy more Unitarian, more ""Arian"" (through the elimination of the creeds,through minimal prayers to Christ and to the Holy Spirit, for example) in short, whose Christology is what conservatives in TEC fear is implied by current leadership in the national church when it fails to recognize those issues as serious. Marshall shows that Seabury consistently and successfully worked to counteract that influence in his own day, while exercising his very considerable pastoral duties, and always putting charity first."
3,Marshall opn Bishop Seabury,"I found this book fascinating - -but the subject is not likely to matter to any but a few readers. On liturgy in the early Episcopal Church, Marshaall is interesting and gives solid references, but on Seabury's place in history, and the effect on subsequent consecrations of bishops, Marshall has not done adequate research and his conclusions are questionable. Finally, he is too concerned to protect Seabury's reputation against his critics, Steiner and Hatchett, neither of whom was all that critical of Seabury, though they may have missed some of the essential facts on liturgy."
1,I received no Laptop from you,This is actually the poorest service I have ever asked for. I have not received the laptop yet and I purchased it online on September 2. Would you please give me my money back? I would buy it from another committed seller.I waited on September 10th and September 25 but I got nothing from you. I do not want you to send me any laptop to make it up. Just send me my money back.Zeena Al-Timeemi
5,ARNOLD==The MASTER!!!,"No doubt the best book on ODE by a master!! Ecuaciones Diferenciales Ordinarias (Fondos Distribuidos) Kiseliov Krasnov is another great book! Translated in English!! Like Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds, thin but good!!!"
4,Stimulating,"Like his books on classical mechanics, a book that theoretical physicists should read. Unfortunately, the discussion of local integrability is too abstract and there is no distinction made with global integrability. Also irritating: because of a singularity at the origin the damped harmonic oscillator is not recognized as integrable in spite of the existence of a global conservation law, excepting one point in phase space. Integrability is an extremely difficult subject and maybe Arnol'd could have taught us more about it. I've discussed integrability/nonintegrability from a physicist's perspective in my Classical Mechanics (Cambridge, 1997)."
2,Beware the Kindle edition!!,"While the style and level of this book are great for students at many levels (read the other reviews for more on that), I made the mistake of buying the Kindle edition. The figures and equations are so tiny as to be mostly unreadable. While you can change text size, the figures and equations remain tiny. Given that all the important details are spelled out in equations and figures, the Kindle edition is useless. Also, there are many errors in transcribing the original text to Kindle. For instance, a zero is quite often rendered as a small o which can be confusing."
1,Over $100 for a mug?????,I'm sorry. I love Buffy. I think this mug is cute and would love to add it to my collection but.... no coffee mug is worth this much money. It's ridiculously over priced. I have seen much better ones on other sites for far less money. Don't buy this. It is not worth it.
1,Mug is overpriced.,"I'm huge Buffy fan, and this would look good in my collection but i wouldn't be caught dead paying almost 200 dollars for a mug , it would have to have all of there autographs on it but i still wouldn't pay 200 dollars for it.. i have saw better buffy mugs then this , and i bet anything you could find the same cup and customize it to like this. other then this whoever paid this price for a mug must have money or must just don't care about prices cause only idiot would pay for this."
4,Enjoying an old musical,"1962 was the year I ended my high school education and started my college education, majoring in Theatre. It was also the year Babb's first musical was on Broadway. I really loved the entire show, the music was wonderful and the lyrics were to die for.I saw the original movie on television a few weeks ago, a straight play, and thought how wonderful it could be converted into a broadway musical, and by golly, they did.The entire cast was just great and I would recomend this CD to any musical comedy buff.I wish Amazon would offer a spell check"
5,Great storytelling,I read Blind Your Ponies - one of the best fiction books I've ever read - so picked this to read next. I wasn't disappointed. West can sure tell a story that is compelling. Wonderful characters.
5,Exquisite,"This is a go-to gift for me; I've bought it for three different people of differing tastes and ages. It's classic and timeless and can fit in with any decor. Highly, highly recommend."
1,Horrible,"This is the unholy combination of dried apricots, inner tubes, and fig newtons. Avoid at all costs. Also, there is no satisfaction policy from manufacturer - just instructions explaining how to store their food products. Check out the manufacturer website.I'd recommend the cherry flavored bars as the those do taste somewhat like cherry pie."
5,Best Dawsons Creek Book I've Read!,"I've read all the Dawsons Creek book! And this one is my favorite!! I Think they are all good, but this one beats them all!! I like the whole auction thing, and how they all get their revenge, but Pacey discovers someone new! and its just great! I also watch the show!!"
2,A little weak,Not very well built. We loaded it up with Bessy clamps and the casters almost broke. Being commited to it I purchsed a better set of 4 casters MUCH better! Not really a quality built unit if I could have seen before buying I would have walked away. To bad it is a great idea and works well for the smaller shop (less bulky and heavy than a shop built wood frame dolly).
1,Junk,"Too tough to actually put together because of a bad design. There is not enough room to even tighten the bolts to the castors. Junk, junk, junk. Don't buy"
1,Never Got It!!,"Amazon says this item ships in 24 hours. I ordered mine Aug 16, it was supposedly shipped on the 22nd, with delivery to be on the 25th. This is the 29th and neither I nor Amazon have any idea where my order is. Amazon has started using a shipper called ""Airborne Home"". Never heard of them. This is the fourth order I have made that has been shipped via Airborne Home......all of them have been screwed up. One took 2 weeks after shipment to show up. They have no tracking, and Amazon won't let you cancel after the item is shipped. So you just wait and hope. I started using BestBuy and Barnes and Noble a few months ago.......they operate the way Amazon did five years ago; great prices and service. They and others will get my future business."
2,RATTLING BONES,"When you view a movie that was made for the SciFi Channel, you either get (1) a surprisingly good one; (2) an okay diversion; or (3) a real dud. SKELETON MAN falls into # 3. With a script seemingly thrown together piecemeal, surprisingly bad performance from the usually good Michael Rooker; a typical bad performance from Casper van Dien; and special effects out of a bad Japanese movie. The killer Skeleton Man comes up with weapons apparently out of thin air; the horse changes colors throughout the film; a fisherman is shot from behind with an arrow which is in the front of his chest; and nothing is ever really depicted as to exactly who his critter is and why the climax ends up in a chemical plant? An attempt to create a ""Predator"" like film falls completely on its face and Rooker should start looking for a new agent."
1,So stupid,"I got this in The Horror Six-Pack from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This one is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. In fact, this movie sucked so hard, I don't know how I'm gonna write this review, especially since 1. I popped it out of the DVD player because I couldn't even watch another second and 2. Hurricane friggin' Ike is coming and God knows how long 'til it take for me to get this review done.The movie starts off with a scientist and his wife. The scientist recieves a valuble artifact and examines it when this supposedly Urban Legend known as the Skeleton Man kills him, and later on his wife. Then...I'm sorry, but there's really not much else I can say about this POS except don't bother. I'm currently using the disc as a coaster, and if you see this, you might want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker must have needed cash...BADLY!PS. I'll pretty much be reviewing the movies in the boxset and might do a new review on Ghoulies IV."
2,MST 3000 CANDIDATE,"Another fine Casper Van Dien movie that should only be viewed in a severe altered state. The movie title is ""Skeleton Man."" I don't recall that phrase ever being used in the movie. The ""Skeleton Man's"" name was Joe Cottonmouth. He was the spirit of a dead Indian somehow revived, apparently through the recovery of a skull. This Native American wore the traditional Native American black cowl, looking like the Grim Reaper and boasting a variety of weapons including that Native American broadsword. The movie consists of a crack government group doing a search and rescue of a missing group and getting picked off one by one by Joe Cottonmouth. The story of Joe Cottonmouth was told to the group by a long white haired Native American with an extremely fake accent. Smoke 'em if you got 'em."
1,So awful . . . must turn off . . . DVD . . . before it's . . . too late,"Poor Michael Rooker, to have some actual talent and be trapped in foul smelling compost like this. I hope he got a thrill cashing his paycheck because you won't get one watching Skeleton Man. I won't synopsize the plot because there isn't one. Some guy in terrible skull makeup and a Wal Mart cape rides around on a horse killing people, including soldiers that are supposedly special forces. For the country's sake, I hope not. The acting is bad but then the dialog is worse. Didn't anyone say to the writer and director during filming, ""What the hell is going on? Do you know what you're doing?"" These simple questions could have saved humanity from the circle of hell that is Skeleton Man."
2,Skeleton Man......,"I rented this movie for 2 reasons. First, because it looked like it might be a good horror movie and Second, because Casper Van Dien stars in it! This movie fails to live up to horror movie status and Van Dien's performance wasn't all that great even though I wish he would have had a bigger role in this movie. Overall disappointing movie and boring plot."
1,casper only good thing about this movie...(not saying much),"Casper was in Starship Troopers and the effects were pretty good, so when I picked up this as a free rental I thought...well I am not paying for it..how bad could it be.It's nice to know my expectations were fullfilled...boy what a bad flick....."
4,Tough Chain Lock,"This chain lock was purchased to secure my generator and protect against unintended loss. It is very heavy and appears to be well made, time will be the test as it is outside with the generator. The chain cover is very nice and makes it easier to handle. I gave it 4 stars because the lock is not easy to unlock. This lock would likely deter any thief because of its appearance. However, as a bike lock it may be a bit impractical due to its weight--it's heavy. For a motorcycle it may be more practical, but it will add weight if you are storing it. This model has a smaller gauge than the 5016, which is thicker, but the manufacturer gives them the same rating. I found a review of locks on the internet and this type of lock and the similar Kryptonite brand rated the highest for security purposes. This brand was a better price then the competition and I was able to look at it locally to make my decision to buy on Amazon at a much lower price."
5,Great Chain,"So far this chain has worked out just fine. I use it to secure my Honda EU3000IS generator in the bed of my truck when we are camping. Very intimidating chain and lock. It would be easier to hack apart what this thing is securing rather than a thief trying to get through the chain or lock. It's cheaper than the Kryptonite locks, but seems to be on par with quality and security. Very heavy duty."
5,Great lock,"Lock was delivered quickly with service. Exactly as described, no surprises. Lock feels like it's over 10 pounds. It is good if you can leave lock at location where you will attach bike. It is very intimidating!"
4,Onguard 5018,"I was able to find the best deal here on Amazon.com. The best competition was about $15 away. The product is very intimidating and allowed me the opportunity to sleep a little easier at night knowing my bike was now somewhat secured. Lets face it, if a theif wants your bike enough he/she is going to get it. I can only hope they'll get their punishment sometime in the future. The only thing we can do is try to make the task harder and guide them to an easier target. I feel this chain is doing just that. I do wish it was about 6"" longer to allow me to chain it on my bike to take where ever I need. It is a physical task to carry this thing in a backpack. So much so that I did it once and decided I wouldn't be doing it again. Good product and very pleased."
4,An excellent mystery with humor and strong characters.,"This is the best of the early Willa Jansson stories. (I haven't yet read the recent volumes that came out after a 5-year hiatus.) Focussing as usual on Willa's personal and professional crises, Matera puts Willa in yet another new job as a clerk for a federal judge, where a casual meeting with a high-powered lawyer leads to complications. Willa has clearly been set up, but by who and why? Willa searches for these and other answers with her ever-present supplies of wit and marijuana."
4,Out of the past,"Willa Jansson is back from a year spent in exile, working for a large corporate firm in Los Angeles for the sake of her resume and bank account. Now she is back in San Francisco clerking for a judge. Before she knows it, she is in the middle of another confusing situation as a result of doing the favor for an old friend. This book was particlarly satisfying as it explored the motivations and conflicts of the anti-war activists. Willa's conflicts are many and the motives and motivations of the characters keeps us on the edge of our chair till the end."
1,rip off,"I am so disappointed in this product. For one thing they were not truly the right size, they did not fit in the diabetic tester. Second I returned them right away and I have not yet received a refund. I do not recommend these batteries or ordering from this copy unless you want to be ripped off. this is Nov. 8th and I sent them back 2 months ago."
2,Not the samwe size as the replacement Battery,Comments:The CR2450 3V Lithium Coin Battery that i received was not a the same as the original battery and does not work the same.
1,Lithium battery,"IT works and was inexpensive to buy them bulk. I have not compared length of time they last with store bought, but given the pricing difference I am not sure it really matters"
2,disappointing,"I bought this unit for its ability to adjust the angle, that the unit would activate at. The unit claimed to adjust down to 32 degrees. The location where i used this unit needed only an angle of 74 degrees. The switch would constantly activate with the blinders on the extreme setting"
3,50/50,"I bought two of these, one works great and all the time and adjustments seem to be accurate, the other one, not so much! the 2nd one seems to work when it feels like it. adjustment after adjustment and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Sounds to me like the 2nd one is a lemon."
3,Works with LED and fluorescent lights but not cold temperatures,"Inside my home, I installed 2 of these sensors and they work well with LED fixtures and fluorescent bulbs.I then installed one of these occupancy sensors and replaced 2 of the 3 incandescent bulbs with fluorescent bulbs in the garage. During the summer, the sensor worked fine. Sometime in late fall/early winter when the temperature dipped into the 40's, the sensor stopped automatically turning on the lights. I can turn on the lights manually, and the sensors would detect motion and keep the lights on. I can leave the the garage, the sensor/lights would shut off. I was hoping that once the temperatures reached the 50's again that the sensor would return to normal operation. The temperatures did go into the 50's briefly, but so far the sensor is malfunctioning and the temperatures are currently in the 20's."
5,Precisely right,"Arrived in 2 days via Prime. Appears solidly made, installed easily and works like a charm. Only two suggestions: the manual should mention it can take a few moments for the switch to charge up before it starts to work correctly. Also, the design could use a sensitivity control, as even the tiniest motions (such as a towel that moves due to an current of air from a furnace duct) can activate the switch. Otherwise, the time-to-off, horizontal range, and ambient light dials work just fine.Definitely would buy more of the same for other installations."
5,CFL compatible,"I was worried about CFL bulbs since I see a lot of reviews that talk about how they got flicker with their motion switch and a CFL. I am nothing but satisfied with this purchase though as it is working perfectly with a CFL, so if you want to use CFL with a motion switch, this one will work well.Something else I was curious about that I didn't know until I ordered one was that these will work in a multiple switch 3-way type setup. I say type because it isn't the normal 3-way wiring, but the diagram included makes it very obvious how to set this up to have a sensor at the top and the bottom of the steps and that was exactly what I needed."
2,Too expensive and tempermental,"These devices are tricky to get just right. I have them elsewhere in the house and I can usually get them adjusted in time. This one either comes on in the daylight, or won't come on at all in the dark. Way too expensive!"
5,Leviton sensor switch works great,"My wife and I bought a house that had a few of these switches installed and we immediately found how useful they are. Walk into a room, the lights automatically turn on, walk out and they turn off after a preset time. We've purchased a couple more switches for the laundray room and bathroom. The only downside (which I knew about before purchasing) is that there are only a few settings for how long the delay is before the light turns off. Those settings are 30 seconds or 10/20/30 minutes. This means if the switch is set to 10 minutes and you walk into a room turning the switch on, once you walk out it will be 10 minutes before the light is turned off. I'd like to see 2 and 5 minutes as an option for the time delay. This switch installs like a standard switch, just make sure you turn the power off before installing."
1,Pricy and doesn't work without a ground wire.,"Had my electrician try to install this and he said because the circuit didn't have a ground wire it wouldn't work.Ran to Home Depot and bought one for $27 and it worked right away not problem.Just go to Home Depot and look for the ones that say ""2-wire""."
1,Junk!,I don't understand why it's hit or miss with these motion sensors. I've installed 4 of these in 2 different rooms and sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. One didn't work for a few months then all of a sudden it worked 90% of the time. It does need to be grounded which can be accomplished by attaching the grounding wire to the box with a self tapping screw. I would hold off on motion sensors until the technology gets better especially at this price point.
1,Leviton,3rd one I bought all to sensitive cant even walk by doorway without it going on even with dozens of adjustments
5,auto lights,Love it. We use these in several rooms both at our primary home and our lake home. Great when your hands are full when entering the closet. Really great with my grandson.
1,Unit does not work,"After installing as instructed, the new fluorescent lights (elecronic ballasts) came on when I flipped the breaker on, but they would not turn off, even after several hours with the garage unoccupied. And once I turned them off manually, they would not turn on by sensing my presence. So I went to the local building supply store and bought a Lutron unit, which worked perfectly. Note: While both of these unit correctly claim not to require access to a neutral (white) wire in the switch box, they both do require access to a ground (usually a bare or green) wire to work."
3,Had two out of six fail,We ordered six of these for a commercial application and had two fail within a day by not shutting off either automatically or with the manual button. One we were able to get working again by playng with the settings and returning them to their original settings. One had to be removed and sent back to the factory. The other four are working well at this time. For the labor time involved it would have been more cost effective to buy a better unit.
4,good product,great sensitivity. color is nice. works with compact florescents. only complaint is that it doesn't have a manual override to keep the light on.
4,Real Puzzle,"I got this game for my sister, who recently had a stroke sheis a Nancy Drew Fan from way back when...She still hasn't got it figured out, but it is helping her tolearn to use her brain for real thinking again..Thank You"
5,Saturday Mornig Revisited,This is a great CD that takes me bake to my youth. Wonderful music from the Bugs Bunny Roadrunner show. I enjoy sharing it with my kids. They also like it and it was a good way to expose them to different music.
5,GREAT SCOTT!,"You may have heard some of Raymond Scott's compositions played by such bands as Ambrose, Sydney Lipton, or Jack Harris, but until you hear this you ain't heard nothin' yet. Scott was a very inventive individual, whose passion for technology influenced his musical compositions, and lent them a unique character.This compilation presents twenty of the 23 commercial releases which the Raymond Scott Quintette recorded between early 1927 and mid-1939, plus two of the later recordings by his New Orchestra. Sound quality is excellent, and trumpeter Russ Case deserves special mention for his high-speed staccato delivery on ""Tobacco Auctioneer"". The 20-page illustrated liner note sets out Scott's career in some detail, although in trying to be equally quirky has sacrificed something to legibility. But never mind, this is a fascinating glimpse of a stylised jazz form which if it never quite took off has never quite gone away either."
5,Nice replica,"I love it, the saber is small, sturdy and quite heavy for the size. I have on display in my office."
4,Great Clamp for the Shop,"This is a great clamp! Easy to use, easy to tighten with the SUMOGRIP handle, and it is long enough to clamp just about anything that it would be needed for."
4,Brilliant Movie,"Movie opens on an intriguing mode that continues to be stronger as it progresses introducing the characters. They have a strong presentation that keeps the audience involved all the time until around intermission when suspense is completely unfolded. Looses the audience around the mid part for 10-15 minutes but the new character then keep them entertained. Songs are unnecessary but who can dare to make a hindi flick without songs. 1st song is really impressive. Rani Mukharajee keeps the tense situation, breezy. Satish Kaushik is unique. Shinde is incredible as usual. Certainly an entertainer."
3,"Not in good condition, but I've used it and it works","It may be a fluke, but the one I got was used and greasy. It had some type of oil all over it and a piece of leather stuck in the punch hole.Nevertheless, I've used this item with success and consider it an essential tool to have. No matter what size belt, I can always very easily create holes just where I want them and with the correct size holes."
1,Piece of junk,The tool came with the larges punch installed and impossible to remove. Utterly useless. Would find another device. Do not waste your money with this product.
5,Works as expected,"I've only used this product once, but it did what I needed it to do, so... what else can I say? It punches holes in leather, sold?"
4,Leather Punch,"The leather punch from AMERICAN SCIENCE & SURPLUS is exactly what I needed, it works perfectly, and has a variety of sizes to choose from."
4,Good Solid Punch,"This punch is made from heavy steel and creates the best holes of the several different kinds I have used previously for leatherworking. The different sizes screw in to the handle and are a bit of a pain to screw in and out when changing. Luckily, I have one size that I use for most everything so I don't have to change it often. I use this mostly for horse tack that is made out of very heavy leather. A considerable amount of force must be applied to punch through this heavy leather. This is typical for all leather punches except for the kind of punch that you strike with a mallet, which can only be used on items that can be laid flat. Overall a great punch for the money!!!"
2,heavy and dull,"this punches the leather, but it takes alot of force to push it through. i am using on 1/8"" thick.it came slathered in grease and took an hour to get clean. its really heavy and felt confident that it would last, but the punches are fairly dull, and my wrist hurt terribly after about 5 punches. im not happy with it, but out of the 3 i purchsed, its the one that actually goes through the leather."
1,Deceiving looks,"I purchased this punch, because from the picture it looked like it was really well built. After receiving the tool, I can confirm that it is built like a tank, but functions about as well as a one legged mule. The punches are very difficult to remove from their stations. The tool and punches were full of grit and grime. It is almost impossible to get the punches to center up on the brass base. They don't contact the base evenly when compressed. And lastly, it takes tremendous effort to punch a hole in even the lightest leather. According to other reviewers, they think a lot of their punch. Maybe I got a dud, because I would NOT recommend this tool to anyone."
1,"Se 8 3/4"" Professional leather punch S.S.","The punch, at first glance appeared to be well constructed. However on further inspection, it was noted that the punches did not line up perpendicular to the anvil. This made it virtually impossible to punch a clean hole. On punch did not appear to be sharpened and I could only make an impression in the leather with it. I later purchased a ""General"" rotary head punch which worked quite well. I would seem that a more careful set-up during the machining and sharpening process would make this an excellent leather punch"
5,Excellent punch,This punch is well built and easily punches through thick leather and vinyl material. I use it often and highly recommend it.
3,Not first quality,"At first glance it seemed to be great, but then I noticed that the punch didn't line up because it was put together crooked. Poor workmanship."
3,Not bad,This thing is ok for the price but if you need to use it often for horse tack and similar thick leather I would spend the money and get the top of the line from a true leather tool store.
2,DON'T LIKE IT,REALLY HARD TO MAKE HOLES AND THE HOLES ARE NOT SHARP CUT. THE DEVICE IS ALSO HEAVY. DONT KNOW WHY WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SO GREASY.
5,Well made for my household uses.,"Surprisingly well cast and made. I use something to cushion the punch from dulling and zap the hole in my belts are made. For my needs it was money well spent. Beats using ice piks, drills, or knives or screwdrivers to punch holes."
2,Great looks but...,"Extremely strong and looks really good, BUT.....The threading on both the main punch and the additional bits holes and bits are really stiff requiring careful use of a wrench to remove and put in. Possibility of cross threading high.I wanted it for leather punching, but it just doesn't do the job despite the heavy materials and good looks. I have yet to get any of the bits to actually punch a complete clean hole. Not sure if it is bit sharpness that is lacking or????VERY disappointing!!!"
4,This is not a straight punch.,"Solid construction, tool has a good feel and the handle is knurled enough so it will not slip in you hand.There is nothing in the description that says that the punches are tapered. While not a concern on thin leather, if you are looking for a straight hole of the size of the ""selected"" punch in leather over 1/16th in thick, you will not get one. The bottom of the hole will be smaller then the top due to the punches taper, not by much but it will not be straight. Not a show stopper unless you are using small head rivets and no roves...Cut a bunch of holes and so far everything works well. When I took the tool out of the box the tack welds that hold the keeper for the extra punches had cracked and the keeper had seperated from the tool but retacking is going to fix that.."
1,Leather punch plier,It took me 50 minutes to punch out one hole. I had about 50 holes to punch. My hand was so sore and tired that I decided to use a drill instead. The drill worked great. The leather punch plier was a total waste of money.
2,Large hole punch too difficult to use,"The punch works well on the smaller hole punches, but in order to punch the largest hole in a 1.5 "" wide belt, I couldn't do it by hand. I had to put the punch on a solid surface and strike the handle with a large hammer to punch the hole. I tried punching the hole from both sides of the belt, and it still required the hammer. If you need to punch the largest hole in a man's large leather belt, don't buy this product"
4,leather punch arrived next day,This leather punch works fine and arrived the next day despite coming from a third party by regular shipping. I am happy and all the more likely to look for more kinds of things on Amazon.
1,Leather punch(?) plier,"Don't waste your time/money on this item. It's heavy, was dirty/greasy on delivery, and did not easily/cleanly punch through a thin piece of leather with any of the bits."
5,Exemplary Tool,"This Leather Punch is the best one I've ever purchased. I have had experience with 6 or 7 punches trough the years, and this one is by far the best."
5,"SE 8 3/4"" Professional Leather Punch Plier, S.S.","I like the different sizes of hole punch screw in to the handle, plus the screws stay the same place not all over the place. I punched almost 15 leather belts already. I gave this one to my friends so they can use it. It works great and price is cheaper then other brands, absolute love this product!!"
4,A collection based on VH1 that just misses,"So far, we have as many greatest hits albums of the Go-Go's as...albums!As a collection this has a number of hits that the 1990 anthology: Greatest missed: Yes or No, and Skidmarks On My Heart. That's good news.However, this package is also a little idiosyncratic. For example: It's Everything But Party Time was heard in the VH1 special, live and studio, it was even mentioned by the group. So, where is it? The same applies to Cool Jerk, and also How Much More.Why is Speeding on this? We had that on Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's.So we have a greatest hits package that is molded after the VH1 special, that misses being molded after said special.Suggestion: buy Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's. You get all these songs, great live tracks, early live tracks with the original line-up. In otherwords, the previous anthology did a better job of reflecting the VH1 special than this, and that wasn't its intent."
3,"SAME SOUND, NEW PACKAGING","After hearing rumors of books, a movie, and (new) recordings, this latest musical offering is dissapointing. Nearly all the songs here can be found on several other ""greatest hits"" formats, including, and probably, the most complete collection offered, ""Return to The Valley of The Go-Go's."" Save your money, and find another ""Greatest Hits"" alternative, or spend a few more dollars and get a true collector's offering with a cool return trip to ""The Valley""."
3,"Brilliant original band, so-so remastering...","I'm 38 now, and these songs bring back great memories from my college days at the University of Connecticut. The Go-Go's were a groundbreaking band back in the 80s, and their music was way under-rated. Listening to them now, and even live this summer with the B-52's, I am reminded how truly clever and insightful their lyrics were and their musicianship, while initially spotty, developed into an incredibly tight ensemble sound. Having said all this, I've got to say that something has definitely been lost in the process of putting this collection together. The sound is not as clear as on the original CDs - especially ""Talk Show"", which was their best album, in my opinion. The sound is a bit muddy - did they use a poor copy of the master tapes for this? I'd recommend buying the three individual CDs instead - more expensive, yes - but some great additional tracks and much better sound."
2,Again,Yet another greatest hits CD from a band that only had 3 studio albums. This is just another way to rip off the fans of their hard earned money! If you must have a greatest hits CD from them buy The Valley of the Go-Go's.
1,Cannot find filters,If you buy this Air Purifier good luck finding replacement filters. I have even tried the companies website. I now need to look for another one.
5,Great!,"This is a great product to have if you work in an office. I work in a pediatric office and I plan on using this on my desk, and hopefully, it will help catch some of the bacteria the kiddos leave around my desk. I'm hoping it cuts down on my sick days and makes the air smell cleaner. Fast shipping! Super quiet."
5,Erotic story at its peak,"This books how shall I say amazing, wonderful, couldnt put it down buy it now before reading another book its that good."
5,Working Well,"I picked this up because I wanted to connect my XBox 360 to my LCD monitor via a VGA cable, and I wanted to connect the Xbox to my speakers through my soundcard's line-in (a common way to do things). I also wanted stereo sound. A previous cable I bought looked exactly the same as this one *except* that it combined the left and right channels into one.This Y-cable, on the other hand, *definitely* keeps the left and right audio channels separate (and everything sounds great). I'm pretty happy with it."
1,Not what advertised.,"I purchased this Cables To Go from ELMENOS. The discription clearly says it is gold. It is not. I did not pay much for it so I am not going to worry about it too much. You might want to be aware that this item is not gold. This is a quote from the product description, ""Gold terminals ensure long lasting, corrosion-free connections."""
5,Great Quality for a Great Price,"One day, I decided to make an adapter to connect my headset to my TV. My friend had given me a list of what I needed, and I set off on my journey for parts. I came across this after a few minutes of searching, and after looking at some of the other options, I went with this. Even though I chose the free shipping option, I recieved this a few days earlier than expected, in excellent condition.I've been using this for about a month and a half now, and it hasn't failed my yet. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that needs this. I happily would have payed a bit more for it, it was that good. Definitely a must-have."
4,Good deal,Does exactly what it's supposed to for less than half the price of radio shack. Why is that place still in business anyway?
1,I'm sure if it's what you were looking for it's great.,"But it turns out it was not what I was looking for, I thought I was buying a single male rca to two female rca splitter. So really, I don't hate it, I hate myself for buying the wrong thing."
4,Y-cable,This product is what i was looking for. Everthing just fine. Are you serious twenty words??? Okay this product works great and is exactly what i wanted.
2,Misrepresented in listing. Not happy.,"""Gold terminals ensure long lasting, corrosion-free connections.""- That's actually copied and pasted from the product description on 09/04/2012.Not only is the cable that arrived NOT gold plated, but is ALREADY BEGINNING TO CORRODE IN THE PACKAGE.I'd bought HDMI cables from this company before with great success, but this is unacceptable."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,I was looking for something to help amplify my home theater sound that only had a single headphone jack. I plugged this in and it worked perfectlywith the speakers I had to make it great sounding. Great prices and quick delivery.
1,Not recommended - junk!,"I used 10 of these so far and they've all burned bad. I used another brand and they burned fine. At first I thought it was my DVD burner so I bought a new one, same problem. I also used a USB DVD burner, same problem. I tried burning at the lowest setting, same problem. Used a different brand of media - PROBLEM SOLVED!Original Drive: 7 bad DVDsUSB DVD Burner: 2 bad DVDsNew DVD Burner: 1 bad DVDIt was hard to figure out they were bad because they had bad sectors on them. So a lot of the data would make it through, but in larger files, it corupts the whole file and you're screwed. I used the ""verify data"" setting on my burning software before I finally figured out DVDs were coming out bad.Don't buy these."
1,Won't play in DVD player,I have a JVC player that takes just any DVD +R media that I've recorded on it - BUT these.
5,Favorite Childhood Book,"I am thrilled to see this book is still available!! ""The Forgotten Door"" is one of my favorites! When I was in third grade, I didn't read very well. I remember crawling to the top bunk and my sister, Andrea, read this book aloud to me. Later, in sixth grade after my reading improved, I checked this book out of the school library and was thrilled once again to be transported through the forgotten door to follow the adventures on Jon. It didn't matter that I knew how the book ended. I still loved it!My sister recently had her first baby, Allison. I knew I wanted to buy this book for her (even if she is a bit young yet). Now I can read it to my niece and the tradition will continue. I highly recommend ""The Forgotten Door"" to readers of all ages. It's truely a classic not to be missed!"
5,This book changed me when I was little,"Of all the things that I had as a child, little remains except my copy of the first edition of this book, published through the Scholastic Book Service, in 1965 for 45 cents, which I purchased in the 4rth Grade at Van Der Veer Elementary School in Somerville NJ. The story is about a boy from another world who by accident enters this one. He is like us, yet he is more like the us we ought to be. Some his special gifts, his harmony with nature, an ability to connect with deep inner sources of being for healing are concepts that are not unfamiliar to us in 2002, but this was heady, cutting edge material almost 40 years ago. In the book we encounter ourselves, our good, our bad. The book is a call to a timeless morality, a powerful little story for kids like I was in the fourth grade awakening to both the conflict and promise of the world around us, and seeking a moral star to guide us."
5,This is a fantastic introduction to speculative fiction,"The Forgotten Door has to be one of the very first SF books I ever read. I still have my copy, an old paperback from the 1960s or 1970s. I used to read this book over and over again when I was a kid. It had drama, suspense, a sense of wonder, mystery. All the stuff that would keep a kid on the edge of his (or her) chair, turning the page. In fact, it was a great book to read late at night when I was supposed to be sleeping. I used up a few flashlights on this one.Alexander Key's book should be considered one of the all-time best fantasy/science fiction novels for kids (it's not really a genre-specific story). Heck, I even recommend it for adults. That old paperback is one book I just can't bring myself to part with."
5,"A gentle, thoughtful gem","Like so many others, I read this lovely book when I was much younger, and it has remained with me to this day. It's a deceptively simple story, told directly & clearly, which poses quite a few difficult ethical & moral questions about the world we take for granted. Yet it's never preachy or heavy-handed. Through the eyes of Little Jon, we not only see the flaws of our own society, with its emphasis on greed, power, and selfishness, but we also get a glimpse of another, better world. Certainly any child who is puzzled by the needless cruelties we so easily inflict on one another will welcome this book. Why *does* it have to be that way? Why *can't* we rise above our worst instincts? Well, maybe we can ... and a book like this is a reminder of that possibility. It's inspirational in the best sense of the word, and most highly recommended!"
2,I hated it!,"I had to read this book for school. It disgusted me. I was bored quickly, and the dialogue was waaaaaaayyyyyyy to simple. I thought the main character was a brat, and it was hard to understand. If you really like science-fiction- GO for it! If you're like me, you can spend your time in much better ways"
5,Awesome!!!,"What an amazing, inspiring book! Kenyon really brings out what prayer is all about, and how we relate to the Father in prayer! A must read!!"
5,Making me a better chef at home,"This is first class teaching at it's best.

5,cloning in the 80's,"I first read this book in middle school when it was nominated for the Young Hoosier award. It was an interesting look at the possibile repercussions of cloning, the secrecy and treatment of experiments and what defines failure in the cloning process."
5,There is no one that sings like Willie!,"I'm a fan. Love Willie, recorded, live, movies....you name it! I truly enjoy listening to these tapes. I think I have at least 25 Willie CDs! I also have a set of picture records that are Willie...he is the GREATEST!"
3,A unique story of love.,"""Words of the Pitcher,"" by Kei Swanson, is a unique story of love, culture, and acceptance. Ms. Swanson has written a wonderful novel that addresses the mindset of the Japanese and the obstacles they face when entering the United States to live. Her vibrant details of the hero and heroine spark an undeniable attraction that is destined to flame into love."
5,One of the best albums / bands to me in a long time...,5 Star No doubt. 10 OUT OF 5 for programming. This guy is amazing and I cant believe it took me so long to stop and listen to Neuroticfish. I would see them floating around my favorite bands with internet searches or they would have a remix of one of my other bands. I even got a copy of this in a bundle of cds I won on ebay but never put it in and gave it a real chance. So glad I did cuz it has got me so back in to music. 100% EBM. Guess there not still making music but everyone of there albums is worth a try if you love EBM. I would compare them to Assemblage23 and I guess kinda VNV... GLEB is my favorite Neuroticfish cd so far...Try it. You will be glad you did.
3,Depressing album,"NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED FROM PAT CONTE. HE IS USUALLY ""UP"" AND ""WITH IT"".HE MAY HAVE TO INCREASE HIS ANTI-DEPRESSANTS.."
4,"Beautiful, but...","This lamp looks pretty nice. The shade is beautiful. While, one big short of this lamp is that you cannot adjust the position by bending the arm. The brass arm looks nice, but it is fixed. It would be better if the switch could control the intensity of light. This switch is just for on/off.WP"
3,Best compilation,"Leonie Rysanek a marqué l'opéra de ses interprétations hyper-passionnées. Beaucoup moins célèbre que Callas en France ou en Italie, elle rayonna surtout en Allemagne et en Amérique. Vraie ""bte de scène"" elle sut adapter sa voix à sa carrière et règner pendant un demi-siècle dans le coeur des lyricomanes. C'est avec George London qu'elle enregistra une fameux ""Fliegende Holländer"" qui reste une référence dans le domaine wagnérien. Ce DVD est donc indispensable pour tous ceux qui ont connu, ou qui veulent connatre cette époque bénie..."
3,Art of the Gun Triple Feature,"I got this pack because I wanted to see Pistol Opera. I figured I may as well get two more movies with it. Pistol Opera was not as good as I thought it would be. It was really ""artsy"". It was okay, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. I was really surprised with the Black Angel movies though. I figured those would be so-so movies. I really did like the first Black Angel. It was probably my favorite of the three. Black Angel 2 was not as good as the first one, but it was still a decent movie. It didn't suck. I was just kind of let down because it didn't come out as good as the first one. Overall the movie pack was cheap and the movies weren't horrible. I don't regret buying this pack."
4,Black Angel 1 and 2 are good but Pistol Opera was hard to watch,"Black Angel 1 and 2 are good ""girls with guns"" genre movies. I liked the 1st and loved the 2nd. Pistol Opera I found absolutely unwatchable. It started out OK but had a hard time ending. This 3-pack is a good deal since it is cheaper than buying any of these movies by themselves.So buy it for the Black Angel movies. All have pretty good picture quality and Japanese audio."
2,not reliable,i bought it during my recent trip to U.S and after 4 months suddendly stopped working...
5,9-11 Ripple Effect:,The best one I have ever seen on what really happened that fateful day. All Americans should see this.
2,Not what it could be,"This book says it all in the title, except I'm not sure what they mean by guide. There is a short introduction of the author blah, blah... The notgeld is listed and easy enough to find but no information, like engraver/artist, where it was pressed, how many were made or how many in circulation, in fact it tells you nothing (and most do not not photos) except there is a general/vague 1-7 scale of rarity with no pricing or suggest value. this was merely a checklist."
2,Not particularly useful,"I bought this book, used it a couple times, and haven't looked at it since. I didn't find much of it particularly useful. It's not user friendly."
3,Our educational system is a troubled house,"Dan Schwabauer's ""Troubled House"" is a call to arms to those facing hypocrisy in today's educational system. Usually an argument should be examined thoroughly before accepting or rejecting its' claims. The underlying theme Schwabauer offers is that people entrenched in our educational system rarely examine the issues if they are in the majority. Too much reliance is placed on the status quo at the expense of valid research. One would think the field of education would be leading the charge for the search for facts. Unfortunately, it is a troubled house and fails when we need it most. Schwabauer points this out in a play that is engaging, whether read or produced for the stage."
5,King Oscar Sardines,Bought this as a gift for my Father in Law and he loved the Sardines in Tomato Sauce. The Sardines are not packed in oil and ithealthier. Would definitely purchase this Item again.
5,Snaps On in a Minue and Works,You can never have enough stability on a tool base. This foots snaps on the mobile base and ADJUSTS perfectly. And looks quality -- looks like it was factory installed.
2,We could've expected mo',"This is, unfortuanatly not his best album. It's way too short and his other albums are the bomb, I shouldn't buy itPeace, Brutus, Amsterdam, Holland."
3,Mehh,"The packaging good, it looks cool, but the movies are all very like Italian Art House or something, very slow and all about tension or mood, not really the horror or exploitation I was expecting, and not really great examples of moody dramatic horror, I love films like the Blind Dead series for example, but these didn't really do it for me. I love these Shriek Show sets and have at least 6 or 7 of them, and this is the only one I really found dull or boring. If you look up the titles on amazon individually all three have a reviewer average rating of 2 stars."
5,Chaplin would be proud!,"With John Barry's great style, this by far one of his greatest pieces. It has a great emotional ""Main Theme,"" two very lively ""Roll Dance"" pieces, and the rest could be moody to some, but I think it's just Barry's dang good stlye."
4,"Great, really serves the movie,........but why the last track?","After seeing the move, we simply HAD to have the album. John Barry is one of our favorite movie composers, and this is one of his best. The fact that he composed, arranged and conducted this performance makes it all the better.However, the second to the last track, is the most superb version of Smile I have ever heard. And then, the last track starts out with that caterwauling female vocalist, completely ruining the mood with her screeching, and then the boring pop bleating by Robert Downey jr with her screeching in the background accompanied by the sorriest drum section I have heard in quite a while. This totally ruins the mood created by the entire album. We play it with our remote poised to kill the last track just before it starts. This is particularly vexing, since we don't remember this in the movie. Perhaps it is music to get you out of the theater so they can blow the popcorn away with their leaf blowers."
5,Fast shipping & nice product-compact size as needed.,Fast shipping & nice product-compact size as needed. Don't overtighten screws or it may start to look crooked- easy fix.
4,"GATCO 20"" TOWEL RACK BRONZE","Quality of rack seems sufficient although it has only been up for about a month.I do feel that it was a little overpriced. However, if you look at other racksabout this size, the price is not even close. Be aware, that todays size of towels will not fit very well. I have taken three average size bath towels, rolled them up & stacked them in a pyramid on top, wash cloths are draped over the bars in the front. All in all, I am happy with the product & will possibly buy another for a 2nd bathroom, although not @ $6?.??."
4,Just right,"We ordered one for a new bathroom. Like the simple lines and utility, also wanted brushed nickel. It is very substantial and easy to assemble and install. My husband liked the first one, so I ordered a second one for a second bathroom. I rated it four stars instead of five only because the second item ordered did not include the screws needed to attach it to the wall. It was easier and quicker just to pick up the needed hardware instead of contacting the company. But the package REALLY should have had everything included."
3,Design could be a bit better for home use,"I bought this to replace the towel bar in my master bath & add a bit more towel storage space. Overall it is a nice product. But it is designed to hold hotel sized towels. Most of us have larger towels at home. You have to scrunch your towels up in the pars to hang 2 per bar & they will hang off the edge on the shelf. The appearance is very nice & assy was easy. Sturdily built too, should last for a long time."
5,Great space saver,This is a great space saver for a small bathroom. Arrived on time and product is good quality and easy to install.
2,too much money for not so much on a shelf,This shelf is ok if you have a very large airy bathroom and very small towels. The double hanging bar sounds like a great idea but i found that the towels wouldn't dry between uses. My regular sized towels were too big to fit on the shelf so this shelf was not very good for my needs.
1,Sooo not worth it,"This film was very confusing. I never knew that vampires were lesbians as well as blood suckers. Some scenes were too funnhy to be scary such as her lover turning into a zombie and another chase scene and her brother receiving messages that were telepathic and made his nose bleed and have a migraine headache afterwards.Not the typical ""horror"" movie."
5,Always wonderful to work with Amazon and resellers!,"I've never had a bad experience at Amazon, either directly or from a reseller. This is no exception. Good service, arrived on time and the item was exactly as described. An excellent and easy transaction."
4,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Compass for Compassion","As a collection and YULEtune crafting, this early 9o's release may still inspire many a songsmith and listener to venture back along a path more parallel in song origin, or forth to seek familiarity with several seldom sung seasonal selections.

5,Here's Why You Should Buy,"Bruce Cockburn's voice is an acquired taste. I'll give you that. Aside from this, however, this has got to be one of the freshest collections of traditional Christmas songs I've ever heard. Gorgeous, sparse, acoustic arrangements of old standards like ""O Little Town of Bethlehem,"" a haunting minor version of ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,"" ""Silent Night,"" and ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,"" are interspersed with ethnic folk songs like ""Riu Riu Chiu,"" ""Les Anges Dans Nos Campagnes (Gloria In Excelsis Deo)"" and ""Iesus Ahatonnia (The Huron Carol)"" to great effect. The recording quality is intimate and uncluttered, giving the whole disc a homey, fireside feel."
4,Great guide for general information,"This was a decent guide for general information about Thailand. You'll probably need to do extra online research in order to get more detailed information. It was great in identifying certain places in the country, although the maps could have been better."
2,Not Enough Detail,I was very dissappointed with the detail content of the 2002 AAA Atlas. I have a 1994 AAA Atlas that has many smaller roads listed that the new edition omits. I was looking for the same quality but updated with new roads and the 2002 Atlas just doesn't make the grade.
3,Virtue succeeds with another angel cd,"Doreen Virtue has a CD out which helps you access your past lives through a beautiful meditation. It is very relaxing! For those who believe in reincarnation, as I do, this is a great way to discover more about yourself and your past lives. Barbara Fifield"
3,Pat Life Review,"This was a good product, but for whatever reason it didn't work for me(at least not yet.) I simply didn't access any past life memories, I think I might have had traumatic memories that my subconscious is blocking. However the CD itself is good, and with practice I hopefully will remember past lives."
2,Just a copy of other people's work & forms of meditation,"I have read Edgar Cayce and Brian Weiss (the psychologist who does past life regressions up at Yale (he no longer practices there) and wrote the book ""Masters of our Lives"", and I have studied Alpha meditation. If you combine the three, you get Doreen Virtue's book/cd. With alpha meditation, you just relax and go into your levels via color. You set up a workshop and have guides come in to help you with your projects (you never call them problems) and can call on them for anything. I am disappointed that Ms. Virtue has run out of her own ideas and is just recycling everyone else's. She is now into losing weight, vegetarianism, and what else is coming? It seems that she is just latching on to the latest trends and hoping they'll stick and we'll all buy into it. I have a huge collection of her cards and books, but this finished it for me."
3,First Time Purchase,Interesting. Relaxing. First time purchasing item like this. Would try another one.
2,Wrinkled,"Disappointed to say the least. After being washed and dried they are wrinkled and not too attractive on the bed. You would have to iron them for it to look nice. They also had a funny smell right out of the bag, I washed them but they still have a little bit of odor."
2,Poor quality,"Quality of sheets was poor, first wash came out very wrinkled. And when moving or changing position the material is rough and makes too much noise as you shift and move on it."
4,Affordable Sateen Sheets - A Long Night's Rest,"I bought these sheets because Amazon attached their own name to it, so I felt it was a trusted purchase. I'm glad I bought them.I bought a full set in chestnut which is beautiful color that is accurately represented in the picture (perhaps half a shade darker if I really dissected it). The sateen finish really makes it glow against my dark wood bed and light green duvet cover. The sheets ran big in terms of length AND width, really evident with the fitted sheet. I was a bit surprised and thought it was marketed as one of those full/queen sets. Nope, they're just big. Easy fix as I tuck the sheet underneath but it is a little more work when I change sheets. At least they don't run small.After washing/drying the sheets as directed, I have not experienced any pilling as of yet. The 400 thread count sheets still feel cool and smooth. I would definitely purchase another set in the future."
3,Value for money...,Need I say more. For the price these sheets are fine. But nothing special. I would buy again. Some reviewers said they pilled. I have had mine for six months now and they have worn well enough.
4,"Pretty nice, a little rough","We have been fairly pleased, but not blown away, by these sheets. They seem to be well made and thick. They are a little rough as others have said, but have softened up maybe a touch with multiple washings. All in all, we were looking to not spend a fortune on sheets, and are reasonably happy with these. We would like to be able to spend a little more to get nicer sheets sometime soon though. These will become our backups when we do."
4,Good Basic Sheets,"I got these sheets for my guest bedroom. They are the texture of sheets that I like - Crisp and Clean. They aren't extremely soft or warm- If you like that, you should probably pick Pima cotton or another type of sheets. I've only washed them once and they probably will become softer but that same crisp and cool feeling I like with sheets. The stitching and fabric also look like it will last quite a long time."
5,Great value - great product!,These are the most amazing sheets I've ever purchased. I have a king-size Tempur-Pedic mattress and box-spring. These sheets are a little generous in their sizing but I just usesheet holdersto keep them in place. They are so cool in the summertime and so soft and warm in the winter. They wash and dry beautifully. I have spent a lot more money on other sheets and they never stood up to my standards. I highly recommend purchasing the Pinzon Hemstitch 400-Thread-Count 100 Percent Egyptian Cotton Sheet Sets!
4,Great sheets,Moving into my first place after college I was looking for something affordable and a step up. These sheets aren't perfect but for the money I don't think you can do any better.
2,SHRINKS!!!!,"Seemed fine when arrived but after two careful washings fitted sheet shrunk so much very difficult to get on mattress,"
3,Comfortable,"Purchased sheets for my daughter, Xmas present. She claims they are comfortable but not that special. Came out of the wash very wrinkled but were fine out of the dryer. I have had egyptian cotton sheets for a few years and these are noticeably not as soft. Obviously, there are differences in quality available."
3,Product description does not match,"I bought this over other sheet sets because it stated that it includes ""two standard-sized pillowcase"" - it only came with one, which was quite disappointing as now I have to use a white pillowcase (that I already owned) with a blush sheet set"
3,Beautiful But Wrinkled And Stiff,"These King sheets are a beautiful plum color, but they are NOT soft. They come out of the dryer very wrinkled, even though I only dry one at a time, and I have a New Large dryer. They fit the bed great, are nice and thick, and very WRINKLED. I thought they would get softer and not so wrinkled after being washed a few times, however, they are still stiff, hard, and wrinkled. We have some other cheaper Egyptian Cotton 300-Thread Count sheets that are as soft as silk and do not wrinkle, so I assumed these would be even softer, since they are a 400-Count and cost a lot more. I would be happy with my purchase if these sheets were not so hard and stiff (I could handle the wrinkles if the sheets were soft)."
2,Pinzon 400-Thread-Count 100% Egyptian Cotton Hemstitch California King Sheet Set,"These sheets are ok except the pillow cases are ridiclously narrow. I can't use them at all. That makes me feel I wasted my money, even though the sheets themselves are ok.Pinzon 400-Thread-Count 100% Egyptian Cotton Hemstitch Queen Sheet Set, Smokey Blue"
3,Comfy sheets,Sheets were soft enough out of package. First wash got rid of slight packaging odor. Sheet set gets softer with every subsequent wash. Great quality for the price. Color was true to Internet swatch.
2,Not soft,These sheets are not soft. I have washed and dried them numerous times and they are still stiff and very wrinkled. I'm not very happy with these sheets.
4,"Great, although the wrinkly complaints are true...","I thoroughly enjoy these sheets! For the price, they really can't be beat. If you are concerned about the wrinkle issue some people have complained about, maybe they aren't for you. To me, wrinkles aren't a big deal though. Love them!"
3,"It's nothing fancy, but does its job.","This is an ordinary product, yet adequate to fit my need. Nothing fancy here to talk about. My kid didn't notice the existence of the sheet, which is a good thing. I like the sheet as it's very cost effective. It's nothing fancy, but does its job."
4,Great value,We needed new sheets for our king size mattress and these worked great. Covered the mattress and stay on and did not pull up like our current sheets. They are a great value for the money and we will buy some more of the same down the road.
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"The fabric of these sheets is wonderful. I am truly pleased. When I washed them, they did come out of the dryer with some wrinkles, but that really doesn't bother me."
5,Very Happy,"These sheets wash well, they fit perfect, and they feel good. We bought a new bed with a much deeper mattress and was a bit worried about the fit of the bottom sheet, but no need they fit perfect. I will for sure be ordering another set of these exact sheets just a differnet color next time."
5,comfy,takes a few washes to soften completely but still comfortable none the less. i cannot comment on quality yet but seems tough. and the color is very nice.
2,"Soft, but elastic wore out too soon","These sheets are strong and soft, however, after just two years of use, the elastic on the fitted sheet completely wore out and won't hug the mattress whatsoever. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Very Scratchy Sheets,"Washed them before initial use. They were very scratchy and uncomfortable. I read another review saying to soak them for 2 hours and then again with fabric softener. Needless to say, it did not work. The sheets are still scratchy and have that ""hotel room sheets"" feel. Hopefully it will soften up from my body oils."
3,Beautiful but not soft,"These shirts are beautiful! I bought them in Plum and they look wonderful on my bed!! However, they are not as soft as I was hoping."
2,"nice look, but","These sheets are made in China (very disappointing) and although they fit the full and queen sized mattress with room to spare (I bought both sizes) the pillow cases are too small, making your nice soft pillow a little bit more firm. The cotton, although Egyptian is quite scratchy on your face, not silky like a supima or percale. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,Not soft enough for me,"I like soft sheets, good scotch, fine women, and great steak. Since I'm only reviewing sheets here, I'll stay on subject. I washed these sheets twice when I got them and they were still very stiff and did not feel soft to the touch. They were wrinkled like crazy even though I washed as directed on the instructions. Yeah, I know they are 100% cotton which does wrinkle. The color was pretty accurate and was about the same as the web site image. I returned the sheets to Amazon and bought a set of Cindy Crawford 400 TC cotton sateen sheets from JCP which I really like. They are 100% cotton and soft and have very minimal wrinkles. I'm giving a two star for these Amazon sheets because, maybe if I had the patience and with many more washings along with some good ole fashioned rock beating down at the creek I could have beaten these sheets into submission, but I do not have that amount of patience for something like this."
1,scratchy,I bought these sheets because of the reviews and was very disappointed. My 6 year old son got into bed with me and would not even rest on the sheets--he put a blanket in between himself and the sheets--he said that they were too scratchy. They will go in the next garage sale we have and I'll stick to buying sheets that I can actually touch before I buy them.
1,ripped after first wash,We were excited to get these sheets after the good reviews. We washed them prior to using them. When I was putting the fitted sheet on the mattress I noticed a huge rip on the seam. We already washed the product so figured we could not return them. DO NOT BUY THESE SHEETS.
1,400 Thread Count???!?!?,I was terribly disappointed with the quality of these sheets. They are supposed to be 400 thread count but they started pilling almost immediately. I can get better quality sheets from Walmart. Very disappointed.
3,"Nice sheets, not nice color","I ordered the Taupe, but it was more of a tan. Nice quality sheets, just not the color I expected."
4,I like these,Very nice sheets - bought the blush and they are a very subtle color. They are a lot softer than the 600tc I also purchased. I would recommend these sheets.
3,Sheet purchase,"When I received the sheets, the color was not the color I thought. When I went back on the site, I realized how I made that mistake. When your cursor was on the color you wanted the color wording was wrong. So hence I got sheets that are peachy and not tan. But I was happy about the quality. I kept them because I did not have the time or energy ( my husband was hospitalized) to exchange. Do not know if I would order sheets again from Amazon."
1,If you want your sheets 2 months later,"The sheets are nice. I like them. What I don't like is when you buy an item and it takes them 2 months to ship it to you. If I would have known, I would have never purchased the sheets. I bought the item when it was ""in stock"" NOT when it was on backorder."
1,3 washings and falling apart already,"Purchased these sheets with such high expectations after reading so many positive reviews. I washed them the first time, they came out pretty wrinkled but that is to be expected, they are cotton. They felt good, not great, but still a new set of sheets needs a few washings. Did not expect that after 3 washings they would have a couple of small holes in them and starting to form those little balls that you find on old clothing. Amazon credited my account and I will be purchasing another set of sheets, just not these!"
3,Nothing Special,"I was somewhat disappointed with this item in that the fabric was not as soft as I expected based on some other reviews. However, the major complaint I have is that, despite following the washing instructions, the sheets came out extremely wrinkled when removed from the dryer."
3,It's okay,"I have used these for over a month (4-5 washes) and they still do not feel as soft as I expected them to be (and yes I did soak them for hours in water and fabric softener, as other reviewers have recommended). hey also hold wrinkles very well; it doesn't bother me - just sharing.They feel 400 thread count and I really hope they loosen up a bit and last for a while."
2,Too small after 2 washings,"We bought the more expensive sheets, expecting higher quality but the cloth seems coarse. Washed in cool water and dried it normal. After one washing the bottom sheet was REALLY tight, but we decided to give it a try. We hate to send things back unwarranted. After the second wash (Cool and cool) it was even tighter - my husband the only one who could put it on - and it probably won't fit after another wash. We checked the mattress, which is a queen, memory foam, and it measures 79""x 59"" and is well inside the normal Queen dimensions. The pillow cases also feel scratchy so we are sending the set back.Love Amazon's return policy."
1,Poor quality.Scratchy fabric.,"I washed with lots of softener 3 times, but the fabric still feel very scratchy. I can't stand sleeping in this, will not purchase again."
1,Honest to God these are Terrible,"I thought I'd give these a try especially because the $50 price tag for 400ct egyptian cotton and mostly decent (4star) reviews. Wow what a waste of money. These sheets don't feel like any 400ct I've ever owned and I question it's 100% egyptian claim. They are rough, with a feeling more similar to tissue paper than soft, luxurious sheets Pinzon claims to be. The other reviewers who rave about its softness have obviously never purchased quality sheets before. At the end of the day, you can get MUCH (and I can't stress enough the difference in quality) softer 400ct pima sheet sets at Macy's if you bring a 15% off coupon for the another $20. Trust me, if you actually want quality then these sheets will just be a waste of money."
4,Soft? 10 washes later...no so much,"I have to say I bought a cheap silk sheets to cover my seat for my dog (Hey 10$ at Ross)..washed them and still smooth.These sheets, out of the box, stiff, almost like paper. I assume the 400 thread. But Target sheets at 300 thread we much softer. So the grand experiment. 10 back to back wash/softener/hot dry..repeat, repeat over this weekend. 52 equivilent loads of softener in the rinse cycle. Soft, not so much. I thought Percale was the softest, egyptian cotten the best. Why are 10$ silk sheets so much nicer than these?"
1,Best Burlap I Ever Slept On,"The 400-Thread Egyptian cotton sheets were the worse one I have ever used. Even after washing and drying six times, following the manufacturer's directions, they still felt like burlap. This product should be called 100-Thread burlap, use with extreme caution."
1,Some of the most uncomfortable sheets I've ever slept on,"I bought these sheets based on the number of good reviews. It took several months to receive them as others have said, but I'm far more disappointed in the quality. I washed them with fabric softener before using them and after sleeping on them for 2 nights, I'm taking them off the bed. The are extremely scratchy and very uncomfortable. Putting my face on the pillow is like sleeping against cheap wool. They're horrible."
2,Not Soft,"From the gushing reviews of these sheets, I thought I was getting quite the deal when I bought them. However, I was extremely disappointed in their quality. While they're a gorgeous color (I got the blue), they feel like cardboard. I've washed them twice and have not felt any difference in the softness. I have a set of sheets I got on clearance at Sears that I like much better and are MUCH softer. I will think twice before ordering linens from Amazon again."
5,Mmmm....,These sheets are great. I bought the mint colored ones and they are very close to color. I like 'em a lot.
4,Good Value,We would normally pay $100. to $140. for a set of this quality. Good value for the money and good selection of colors.
5,"Good Sheets, Great Bargain",These sheets are soft and the size is generous making them fit well. The fabric is sturdy but is soft to the touch.They are great sheets.
5,Amazing sheets!,"I got this set of sheets for my sister, who recently renovated her room. She's 15, and extremely picky with her sheets! But these proved to be perfect for the style and theme of her room. They are very soft, and fit perfectly with a twin mattress. It keeps her warm at night since the sheets don't get too cold like other sheets do. It's perfect! We're looking to buy other sets in different colors for her soon!"
4,Good Value,"We have had these sheets only for a few weeks, but I have no complaints so far. The texture and quality is good, and the sheets launder well."
4,Sheet Set,"The sheets are great, very soft. But the color is not really ""blush"", it's more peachy than pink."
4,Good Buy,"It's good fabric, the color wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it does the job, got a set for college, it beats the 150TC ""Campus Linens"" catalog sheets."
1,Terrible product,"I read the reviews about these sheets and decided to take a chance. They were fine write out of the bag, Then after two weeks I washed them, cold water and light heat on the dry. They shrunk, WOW !!!! I have never had a pair of sheets shrink before. It appears that I got a pair of the bad ones. Good luck to you if you purchase these sheets."
2,Made in China--persistent chemical smell,"These sheets are made in China. They have a strong smell of industrial chemicals which only mildly subsides after washing.Amazon--why don't product descriptions indicate the country of origin? Readers--if you want this information, suggest you start asking for it in reviews."
4,Nice sheets,"I bought these in the Friday sale for $29.Great buy in my opinion. The top sheet is oversized, plently of over hang on the sides. The fitted sheet also a nice size. Washed them first before putting them on the bed, yes they do have a slight wrinkle coming out of the dryer nothing to that effects comfort. I would say the softness is okay, I don't think they are scratchy at all. They could be a little softer but for the price I think these sheets are well worth the money. I'm waiting for the sale again to get another set."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I expected a great set of sheets for an incredibly low price. My mistake. It is true, ""you get what you pay for."""
1,not really available,"I ordered these sheets in January. They were delayed three times and are now expected to come in September (9 months later). I expect them to be delayed again at that time. I think Amazon has just decided to take my money and see how long I'll wait until asking for it back.I sent the company an e-mail, but they were not very helpful."
3,Sleep tight,The sheets arrived quickly and were wonderful to sleep on. Wish I had purchased more. Not very many companies on Amazon will send to APO boxes. Tried to purchase another set but have been unsuccessful as they have stopped sending to APO boxes. Hard to buy again with living overseas. Would recommend product if they will send them to your address.
1,"Before ordering, please read","I ordered this sheet set right after Christmas - in late December. Early in April they still were not in stock and the item still reads that they will be ""in stock soon"".If you order these, be prepared for a l-o-n-g wait."
2,"Soft but the ""Blush"" color is orange","After waiting over a month for the sheets they FINALLY arrived. They are very soft and comfortable but the color is NOT what it looks like online. Amazon shows the color as being a light pink when the sheets are more of an ugly light orange. I'm debating on whether or not I should return them or just try to dye them.So don't be fooled....""BLUSH"" = ugly orange!"
3,sheet set,"We love the color and quality of these sheets. But,the top sheet is way too big (even though it's labeled ""queen"") and dangles off the edge of the bed below our comforter, so we have to ""hide"" it by folding it up when making the bed. We are about to get a new pillowtop mattress. We're hoping that maybe this was a fortunate accident as those mattresses tend to be a bit deeper. Our old sheets may not fit, but these may be the right size???? Also, they come out really wrinkly from the washer/dryer...tend to flatten out after use though."
4,Quality at a nice price,I recently purchased a set of the Pinzon 400-Thread Count sheets and was very pleased with the feel and quality. I have a pillow top queen mattress and the sheets fit perfectly with no slippage. They are cool and soft to sleep on. They wash/dry well and for the price are a welcome addition to my bed linen. I will purchase future sets. More quality for less of your money.
3,Easy-to-sleep-on sheets,"These sheets were a good buy; for the price, they are soft & easy feeling on the skin. Unfortunately, they do wrinkle after washing & drying. I put a light weight blanket on top & it isn't noticeable. However, I do iron the pillow cases for a crisp look. The color was exactly as shown. Yes, I would buy another set."
2,wrinkly ass sheets,"Wash these things one time, and they feel like a layer of sand under your butt whilst you sleep. unbelievable."
2,Nothing good,"This may be 400 count, but it's 400 count plastic. It's nowhere as soft as any of my other sheets even after several washings. To add to my annoyance, the package was a mess and was missing a backing label (I wonder if they thought I'd forget whom I'd bought it from?)"
5,"Very, very nice","Was pleasantly surprised by these beautiful sheets especially that they are only 400 thread count. Have seen so many sheet sets that are described as 800,1000 TC etc. and these look and feel much better. I chose these because specifically did not want that ""sateen"" look or feel. It makes sheets feel cheap to me. These are thick and yet soft with that nice fine hotel feel. Chose the 'smoke blue' color and it's beautiful- a nice dusty blue. For $59 for a queen set could not ask or find nicer. These were for guest bedroom but want some for my bed now too. Great purchase."
3,Not soft,"I also read the great reviews from other customers and was very disappointed when I got my set.For 100% Egyptian cotton and 400 thread count I expected them to be much softer. I have another 400 thread count cotton sheet set from another brand and they are really soft.The price is good, but if you are looking for soft sheets, look for another product."
4,Soft but wrinkle easily,"These sheets are great and they do actually get softer with more washes, however, someone like me who DOES NOT like to iron...ever....will find them a bit of a pain as they wrinkle easily."
3,"Thick and soft, but not durable","My initial reaction when opening these sheets was, ""Wow!"" They were the heaviest, thickest sheets I'd ever seen in my life. They were also very soft to the touch, with a slightly shimmery look. And the fitted sheet was huge, accommodating our extra-thick mattress with ease.So why not five stars and a glowing review? Notice my use of the past tense.The sheets are history after falling apart in the wash. First, the bottom sheet ripped, then the pillow cases, and now the top sheet. While the fabric is very heavy, it's not durable at all. The sheets didn't even last 6 months."
4,Pinzon Egyptian Cotton 400 tc King Sheet Set,I only ordered one set to try out and am now impressed. After four washings they are softer and have no signs of wear. They are very wrinkled after drying but smooth out quickly after making the bed. I plan to buy more sets now that I know they will hold up to heavy use and multiple weekly washings.
2,Not made in Portugal,"Product description clearly says ""Made in Portugal."" Sheet set that arrived today indicates ""Made in China."" OK, for nearly anything nowadays, if I don't see country of manufacture, I assume it's China. But I try -- when I can -- to buy from other countries. I didn't appreciate the incorrect product description."
1,Really rough and itchy,"Bought these sheets due to the high rating. They're terrible. Very rough, scratchy and itchy. Even after washing numerous times. Just terrible."
4,Very Nice,"The sheets fit wonderfully on our oversized king mattress and they feel great; since they are cotton they wrinkle badly when washed however, they remainded the same size and provide us with comfort. We enjoyed the first set so well that we purchased two additional sets in two different colors."
2,Smelly and not very soft,"I had to wash these sheets 3 times to get the chemical smell out of them (even using the new Downy unstoppables each time). After all the washing, I expected them to come out nice and soft, but they are still pretty scratchy. I'm disappointed in them and ended up purchasing a different set from JcPenney for less money and are so much softer without the smell."
2,Sheets are not soft,I have ordered 400 count 100% Egyptian cotton sheets in the past and been very happy. The sheets felt smooth but they are not soft to sleep on and I have washed them two times with no improvement. I will not be using them on my bed. They feel rough and uncomfortable to the skin and are not cool feeling like cotton.
3,"Made in China, not Portugal. Lots of wrinkles","100% cotton sheets are not easy to find at a good price. I would have rated higher, but I don't like the incorrect description that the sheets in the eggshell color are made in Portugal, because they are not. Also, they came out of dryer quite wrinkled."
2,Good Quality and fit but not very soft.,"We bought two sets of these sheets. We are stuck with one set as we have washed them 5 or 6 times. We keep hoping that they will get softer, but they remain scratchy. I don't know how 100% cotton could be scratchy, but they are. Perhaps it is the chemicals use to dye and starch. Who knows? I am returning the unopened set."
4,happy sleeper,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE WAY THESE SHEETS FIT. I HAVE A PILLOWTOP MATTRESS AND THESE FIT VERY WELL. I OFTEN HAVE HAD TO REMAKE MY BED EVERY MORNING BECAUSE THE SHEETS WOULD NOT STAY BECAUSE OF BEING TO SMALL EVEN WHEN I PURCHASED FOR DEEP MATTRESS. HOWEVER THEY DO WRINKLE QUITE A BIT BUT NOT ENOUGH THAT I WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN.
4,Beautiful Color. A Tad Smelly.,"These sheets are very comfortable, wash beautifully and the color is gorgeous. It is really almost a slate blue, not very dark, almost silvery. The quality is very good. Deep enough pockets to cover the mattress plus a mattress pad with ease. My only complaint is that the sheets have a petroleum smell or a rather off-putting stench about them. I will keep them and just deal with the stink, and hope that it goes away after repeated washings. So while gorgeous, I'm kinda wondering what they are doing to my lungs! However as Fernando would have put it, it's better to look good than to feel good, right?!"
4,Great value,"I really like this product as I had purchased them before. They are soft, true to color and wear well. I also bought the brown sheets.It was odd that the blue were rougher and a bit scratchy. I am hoping they will soften after a couple of washes."
1,very disappointing,It is like sleeping on sandpaper....I now have washed the sheets several times soaking for several hoursand using fabric softener. That has helped some. I really am disappointed in these sheets how stiff they are.
1,disappointed,These sheets and cases were a big disappointment. They are coarse and thick and uncomfortable against the skin. Washing did not help.
2,Doesn't feel like 400 thread count,"This doesn't feel like a 400 thread count sheet , unless you iron it. It comes out the dryer extremely wrinkled, like a piece of crumbled up tissue. I ironed the pillow cases in o. rder to use them. The sheets went to the thrift store. I washed 3 times trying to get them to soften=no luck and I am not about to iron sheets!!! NOTE: these are not returnable according to instructions in shipping package. Sorry Amazon, not a good product"
2,Scratchy sheets,Sheets are scratchy. Not the quality expected. Would not recommend. Color and fit are fine. But sateen 400 thread count should be soft and comfy not scratchy like this set.
4,"Nice sheets, color was off","The color online looked more beige than the sheets actually came. I ordered ""sand"" but the sheets definitely have a green tint to them. I used anyway, and they're nice sheets. Definitly check the accuracy of the color if it's important."
5,"Best sheets, ever!","These are the nicest sheets I have had in a long time. I have a double pillow-top QN bed and these sheets are ample for tucking in on the side, where other sheets have not been. They are soft, hold up to washing, and extremely comfortable! I would absolutely buy several more sets and recommend them to anyone!"
3,Ok...fit large matresses,"I got these sheets because most reviews said they fit deep/large matresses very well. I have Cal-King Mattress with a memory foam pillow top. The fitted sheet has elastic all the way around the bottom sheet so they fit well and stay on. I'm a larger size person who tosses and turns a lot at night...and these stay put! As for softness...I'm not too impressed. I've only washed them once so I am hoping they get softer with time. They are ok...I dont hate them, I dont love them. Most likely would not buy again unless they were on sale."
5,"Love these sheets, they're so comfy. would like different patterns.","would love to see flower, stripes etc something other than plane. or a flat sheet in flowers with a fitted plane sheet."
5,My son loved them,"Nothing much to say really, but good cotton wholesome sheets. My son loved them, and that's a plus in my book."
3,Sheets thicker than I wanted,"I had ordered some Wamsutta sheets in the same thread count and they were much lighter weight and softer. I suppose I can use these for the Winter, but I really wanted something not so heavy."
2,Only 1 pillowcase!,"Sheets look nice, about right for the price, but this ""set"" includes only 1 standard pillowcase. First time I've ever seen this, and probably wouldn't have purchased this set if I had known about it - who uses only 1 pillow? Now I'll have to find something else that will match..."
2,Itchy scratchy show!,"Oh my god these sheets are awful. I expected them to be rough to begin with... I soaked them for 24 hours in the wash... they softened up a bit i guess... but not much. I repeated this process 4 times. They are better, but still not the soft lavishness I expected from some of these reviews... The purple was definitely much softer than the tan. I'd recommend, sadly, walmart or targets 400 thread count sheets over these..."
4,"Good sheets, mediocre dye","These are nice sheets, but after one night of sleeping on them, one of the pillowcases is already stained! I know that acne products with benzoyl peroxide can leave bleach stains, but I hadn't used my overnight face cream, and I had showered over 12 hours earlier. I'm not sure what happened, but I have to conclude that the dye on these sheets is just not of the highest quality, or not properly set. There were small bleached streaks on the sheets when I washed them after taking them out of the package. I really like the quality of the sheets, I'm just disappointed that they're not going to stay nice. Also, they tend to wrinkle.One other thing. I got these sheets in ""Blush"" thinking that they'd be light pink, but they're actually kind of a light peach color. Those ones didn't have problems with staining, but the ""Mint"" color, while being a nice light green, did stain."
4,Lovely sheets!,"These sheets are a wonderful quality for the money, the color was perfect and they fit my super deep mattresses very well. My only small complaint is that they smelled like kerosene when I first received them. I had to run them through the washer twice before the smell went away, but it left me curious what in the manufacturing, packing or shipping process caused this. All in all, I would buy them again."
2,Pills and more pills,"I am very disappointed in these sheets. They are soft, they were a nice eggshell color and have deep pockets, BUT, they did the worse thing possible - they pilled. Large areas of pills at the top and the bottom. Yucc. I bought them in October, 2011 and it's now January, 2012,so they are only 3 months old. I rotate between a few sheet sets so I don't use the same ones over and over. I have had sheets in the past that don't pill at all after years of use. I would never waste my money on these again."
2,rough and pills,"At first it was soft, but after using it for 6 months it has started pilling. I use a front loading washer and wash it in hot water on the perm press setting--so it's not being treated roughly!"
2,Price was great; sheets not so much.,The sheets do not breathe as much as I would like and the fitted sheet shrunk so I can barely fit it on the mattress. They are far from wrinkle resistant.
5,FEELS wonderful!,After buying cheap Walmart sheets for years these sheets feel beyond heavenly. It feels so good to lie down on them with the ceiling fan on low. I'm happy and surprised at the other negative reviews.
4,"Good value, good quality","A slightly heavier cotton, and prone to wrinkling if you don't get them out of the dryer and folded quickly. But a fine set of sheets nevertheless. Comfortable, and warm. These are my backup set to some more expensive sheets I got with my new king mattress. The more expensive ones are from LL BEAN and are very soft. These are somewhat less soft, but I think every bit as good in terms of quality. These are the kind of sheets you want under your comforter in cold weather --not that the Bean sheets aren't good for that as well, but the slightly heavier gauge of these Pinzon's are going to add warmth as well. In all, for the price, these are outstanding."
5,Great Sheets,"These are outstanding sheets, even more of a vlaue considering the reasonable cost. Excellent feel and very soft, right out of the box. The top sheet is extra long and the fitted sheet is has elastic around the entire sheet, not just at the corners. In addition, they are deep enough to handle our standrd mattress and the 4"" memory foam mattress with room to spare. Very pleased with this purchase from Amazon."
4,Soft and Comfortable,"The sheets feel like they are satin. I have a thick mattress, this would have fit an even thicker one. I like the sheets and probably will buy more."
2,Itchy,These are very heavy sheets. They do seem to be good quality and are pretty. However they are just not very soft. I have trying washing them several times and even with viniger.
3,"Good price, but sheets come out of dryer with wrinkles","These sheets don't cost much, but when they come out of the dryer, they are badly wrinkled. Fortunately when I sleep on the sheets at night, I can't feel the wrinkles (or see them)."
2,Lacking in Comfort,"I just received a set of these sheets as a gift and was initially pleased to see that they were of 100% Egyptian cotton. I thought that was a good thing, but after sleeping on them, I'm not so sure.On the plus side, the sheet color is rich with a bit of a sheen. Stitching appears to be of quality, and I do like how nicely the fitted sheet fits. It's been a struggle finding snug fitted sheets since my mattress is of an average thickness. Hats off to Pinzon.But this is not comfortable bedding. The sheen gave the impression of a ""sateen"" feel, but not so. The cotton is rough, scratchy and feels like polyester. To be fair, they've only been washed once and could soften over time, but we'll have to see. Judging by how wrinkled they were coming straight out of the dryer, that may only be wishful thinking."
2,Like sleeping on canvas,"I soaked the sheets like another reviewer suggested and it made no difference. I washed them twice before sleeping on them just to remove the smell, as they smell like they are made of recycled tires. Much like everything made in china they look better than they actually are."
2,Not very soft,"I actually returned these sheets, they do not feel soft at all and were actually pretty scratchy. I like the color, is just as described, but unfortunately the feel of these sheets was quite dissapointing."
2,Not worth it,"Giant splotches of color were coming out of the pillow cases after 2nd wash.The top sheet was so big, it was unusable -- a full 3 feet wider than each side of the bed, even though it was labeled as a queen.And most importantly, they were not that soft.Returned."
1,Probably one of the worst sheet sets ever!,"Perhaps the color has something to do with why I found my sheets to be horribly stiff, wrinkly and hard. I purchased the plum and they even smelled funny out of the package. I tried washing them twice to no avail. They still had a lingering odor and were thick and hard. I think I could get a better night's sleep on cardboard. Never again will I purchase sheets I can't feel first. Lesson learned. Those who are considering the plum, try your luck on another brand."
3,"A bit stiff, but awesome fit for King Deep Mattress","I am so picky when it comes to sheets, these are a great size and make a bed look absolutely perfect. They aren't really soft and feel pretty scratchy, it's definately not a sheet i would be comfortable running my hands over nor a sheet I would ever buy had I felt it in the store. They were tolerable at night in fact they were pretty warm. I wouldn't buy again but I don't hate that I bought them. I feel that you could get better at a store for the price paid.Pro'sLarge FitCrisp White ColorMakes a bed nicelyCon'sVery ScratchyWrinkled really badly, even on Med Low and Wrinkle ReleaseDoesn't feel like Egyptian Cotton"
1,Awful,These sheets are NOT soft. I don't understand how they can be such a high thread count and be so stiff and rough. I sent them back.
1,Scratchy!,"I received these sheets the first part of April hoping to get the same comfort as my Scala 100% Egyptian Cotton 400 TC sheets. These sheets have been washed at least 10 times in the hopes they would soften up.One word describes these sheets. SCRATCHY! Trust me, don't buy these."
3,Scratchy sheets? SOAK THEM!,"These sheets come HEAVILY starched and, therefore, are incredibly scratchy, as other reviewers have noted. Simply washing them won't get the starch out. I washed them once and almost returned them. They were awful! Then, I read the other reviews and figured that the sheets much be scratchy from the starch (how else could cotton be scratchy?). I soaked them in cold water for 2 hours with salt to set the color. Then, I added fabric softener and let them soak for another two hours. After this, the sheets were wonderful - softest sheets I've ever owned! After soaking and washing, I'd give them five stars, but I downgraded them for having to work to get the starch out."
5,Wonderful Sheets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I usually buy 420 thread-count. These are very nice sheets and they fit perfect on my extra plush 16 1/2in pillowtop cal king bed. I had no problem with them wrinkling when I washed them(in cold water)I took them out of the dryer just before it cut off and folded them right away the fitted sheet did wrinkle some after folding but lets face it who can fold a fitted sheet without it getting wrinkled, once it was on the mattress the wrinkles smoothed out. They are thicker than I am used to so if you do not like thick sheets these are not for you. I absolutley love them!!!! I bought 2 sets and am going to purchase 2 more to set aside for later."
1,Very disappointing,Doesn't live up to 400 count quality. After a half dozen washing of my queen size sand colored sheets they are still rough. Would not order again.
1,Unexpected rough texture after washing in cold water.,"The color was not true to the picture.The texture of the sheets and pillow cases is extremely rough after washing in cold water twice to get the ""new"" smell out. Read in reviews that washing in cold water would keep them softer. Very disappointed in the product."
2,Stay on bed...but SCRATCHY!,"I have a pillow top on both sides of my mattress, so it has been difficult to find sheets that fit well. These fit my mattress beautifully, so I ordered a second set. While the first set is not the softest, it is okay, and I use them regularly. However, the second set is unbelievably scratchy, even after many washings with fabric softner. I finally threw them out."
2,Wrong size label,"I ordered ""full."" The labels on both top and bottom sheets say ""full."" But when I put them on the bed, they were much too large. I measured them. I checked the dimensions in the product description. They are really ""queen"" size.They seemed all right quality-wise. If they fit, I'd keep them, although I suspect the hemstitching will prove to be a rip waiting to happen."
4,Ok,Came quickly in good packaging. Nice feel and good fit. I will order again when necessary.Can't stand the minimum words requirement for these reviews.
1,Horribly scratchy fabric,"I've washed these sheets more than 10 times and they are only now tolerably unscratchy. At first the smell of the sheets is quite overwhelming (2-3 washes to get rid of) but then trying to sleep on the sheets is a nightmare. After 10 washes and a significant amount of fabric softener, they are at least usable, though I still find myself waking up on the couch after a restless night in these sheets."
4,Good for the price,"This is a house brand for Amazon. The quality is great for the price. Beware, the more desirable colors can cost up to $10 more per set."
2,Wrinkly sheets with chemical smell,"These seem to be Amazon's own brand and were just not up to my expectations. I had to wash them 4 times just to get the strong chemical smell out of the sheets. I followed the care instructions but the sheets wrinkle terribly. I had to wrestle them on our extra thick mattress (all other sheets I've bought fit fine) and still couldn't get one corner all the way on. The top sheet also is not as wide as usual. They are just a medium softness, nothing impressive, and definitely not as nice as the last set I bought for just $10 more.Would not recommend or buy again."
3,Quality has been reduced,I had previously purchased several Pinzon sheet sets from Amazon and found them to be of high quality and a very good value but the newest sets are quite inferior. The current quality is only adequate and doesn't equal the high Amazon standard I've come to trust and rely on. The material is lighter and thinner than the three sets I ordered two years ago.
3,Not as soft as I expected...,"They fit well and didn't shrink, so I kept them, but I have washed them multiple times, with fabric softner, and they just aren't soft!"
4,Not Great out of the box / much better with some prep,"These are very nice, but take some preparation to make them cozy. Actually quite scratchy out of the box,,,,BUT, with the right treatment,,,,you are going to have your most FAVORITE SHEETS EVER!!!! I read other reviews about fabric softener. I put them through the washer three times with 2-4X the recommended fabric softener with cold and warm water. They got a little better. BUT,,,when I put them through a fourth time with HOT water, they came out soft and silky. They get softer with every wash. These are the thickest sheets I've found, but they don't feel heavy. THey actually breathe some. My next sheets WILL be Pinzon, and yours will too! I gave it four stars due to the extra mile in washes."
5,Great sheets,"A very nice set of sheets. Quality of stitching looks excellent. Sheets are soft for 400 threat count. A good price, overall a good value."
2,not soft enough for me,"would not buy these again, there were not very soft like I thought they would be, would have returned them if I hadn't washed them in an attempt to soften them up."
3,The fabric is thick and warm but...,"They are thick and warm and pretty (color blush)but not as soft as I'd like.Although they seem well made, they are a little rough to our skin. I have washed them 5 times and they are not too much better. I suppose if you look 5 years down the road, they'd be great! :-) I live in Florida and I do not need the warmth that they provide so these are really not good for me. I'll put them in the guest room because the AC really blows cold in there.No pajamas in this house so our tender skin does not like these but if you are living in a home who wears PJs, they are great."
2,400-count sheets,"What A Waste Of Money! After two washings, these sheets come out of the dryer loooking like they were rolled up in a ball, while wet, and left to dry. I have T-shirts that come out of the dryer looking better than these sheets. Unless you iron your sheets, or have someone iron them for you, save your money. I'm embarassed to put them on my bed."
4,Great sheets!,"Awesome sheets. Washed up nice, very soft, thick, but cool, and not uncomfortable. Will wrinkle quickly if not removed from the dryer quickly."
3,Holy Wrinkles!,"Overall, this product is wonderful. I'm a bit of a sheet freak and have all sorts of sheets in my house. Expensive, inexpensive, flannel, low thread count, high thread count, silky smooth, rough and itchy... These arrived and I took them out of the packaging and was very impressed by the weight of them. They are smoother and softer than I thought they would be, but...holy moly...can we say wrinkles? I washed and dried them, knowing from the reviews that they would need pressing. But, I didn't know just to what extent they would need it. I was ironing all night (because I purchased the matching duvet set, as well). These aren't just ""a light pressing will do"" sort of set...it's a ""haul out the big guns and steam the ever loving tar out of them"" set.Once washed and ironed, this is, indeed, a gorgeous sheet set, but let me just say this loud and clear...I am not looking forward to ironing these every week. The maintenance is what has knocked two stars off of this review/rating."
3,Sheets are stiff,I should've opted for a higher thread count. The sheets are a 400 thread count and are still stiff after 2 washings. The sizing is good; they fit my pillowtop well.
5,Great sheet set,"I was a bit sceptic but these feel great. I saw come comments about the color fading, so far no problems at all. A great buy"
3,These sheets are OK,"They have a very linen tooth to the fabric, which is great if you're into that kind of thing. I was hoping for something that was smoother and softer. They do fit my extra deep pillow top mattress though."
2,Lint Collector,Nice sheets but had to stop using them because they collect little lint pills / balls every time I wash them.
2,Egyptian Cotton?? I Think Not.,"These sheets are extremely stiff and rough. After numerous washings and ultimately soaking in vinegar overnight they became somewhat soft enough to use. They are unlike any Egyptian cotten sheets I have ever owned, and I am skeptical that there are what they are advertised to be . They were not worth $59. I regret my purchase."
2,Worst Lasting Sheets I Have Ever Had,I thought they looked good and mine felt OK. The problem I had is that they only lasted a little over a year. There were tears in the fitted sheet and the pillow cases were coming out at the seams. I have never had this problem with sheets before. Even really cheap ones. They usually last longer than I want them. These are obviously poorly made.
2,Peach?!,"The color is completely off from the website description. These are PEACH! The quality seems okay so far, but did I mention they are PEACH?!"
1,Very Rough Sheets,"I'm quite disappointed with this set of sheets. I washed them prior to using, and honestly, they have a very scratchy and rough feeling. I'm hoping that with time and additional washings they'll feel more like sateen. Now, they feel like poplin or light weight canvas. No exactly what I want to sleep on!"
3,Color not as expected,"Pros: the sheets fit my pillow top bed perfectly. I was worried that the pockets might not be deep enough (18 in), but its just fine. I was disappointed in the color. The picture makes the sheets look more beige, but they are more orange. After washing, they are all wrinkled. I kept these sheets, but won't order any more."
2,Not as soft as I'd imagine...,"Received these today and am a bit disappointed. I opened the package and gave the sheets a good feel. Although the quality of the stitching and fabric is defiantly noticeably higher, they didn't feel any softer than my WalMart bought, no thread count specified, cotton-poly blend sheets. I figured, maybe they need to be washed to ""bring out the softness"". Nope. Still feel the same as my cheap sheets. Definatly won't be buying any more of these, but this is my first high thread-count sheet set, so I'll hold off my judgement on so called high-quality sheets until I get a more expensive (maybe a higher thread count as well) set.The size of the sheets is perfect, this is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. The fitted bottom sheet fits my thick (14"") mattress with room to spare, and the non-fitted sheet is extra long and much wider than I'm used to. There's over two feet of extra sheet on the foot of the bed and plenty of tuck-in length on the sides."
4,Sheets,Not as soft as I thought they would be. And definitely not wrinkle free. Color is a nice creamy white. All in all I am satisfied.
2,Color is fading,"Unlike some other reviews, I do think these sheets are soft and comfortable - agree about the wrinkles, though. My problem is that after the first washing with Tide with Downey, there were faded spots on one of the pillowcases -smokey blue turned to a peachy off-white. After the second washing with the same detergent, I saw the same fading on the top sheet near the hem. Anyone else have this problem? How do we let Amazon know? I don't see a customer service button and I don't want to return them."
4,Good value,"These aren't anything to rave about, but they're soft, feel like decent quality, and wash well. I'm satisfied with them. They come out of the dryer very wrinkled. I don't care; I just mention this because I learned while reading reviews that some people consider it a negative."
3,"""Maize"" color should be named ""Peach"" instead","I'm a long-time fan of Pinzon's overall quality and value, so I ordered this queen sheet set in ""maize"". They are well made, and I like the larger hem detail. My only complaint is that the color is actually more of a peach tone, and not as shown in Amazon's photo. I understand color monitors vary; however, everything else I ordered matches the photos perfectly. So just beware if you're expecting a soft golden-yellow pastel that this particular set will have more of an orange undertone."
2,False Advertising,"I just got the sheets and I am not happy. These sheets are certainly not sateen and don't even feel like 200 thread count Egyptian cotton. They are rough and scratchy. I like a soft sheet and really was looking for sateen. It's hard to find quality sheets these days and I thought these were a bit pricey, but it would be worth it. Do not believe all those positive reviews. If you have ever slept on 300+ thread count Egyptian cotton sateen sheets before you will be seriously disappointed when these arrive."
2,Stiff,These sheets were not as soft as i expected. They were actually pretty stiff and still are even after i washed me a few times.
2,STIFF!,I ordered the full size white sheets and was surprised at the stiffness. It did not get better after several washes. I would look for another brand if softness is important to you.
3,Color is WAY off for Chestnut!,"We just received our sheets (Chestnut color). These are VERY olive green, not a darker tan color. They seem like good quality, but the representation with the amazon picture REALLY doesn't represent the true color. Beware of the Chestnut color."
4,Great Value,"These are quality, well constructed sheets. I purchased the blush color which is a lovely soft pink in queen size. I would say that the fabric is a cross between a percale and a sateen. However, these are not light weight sheets and therefore I feel not suited to hot weather. The sheets are generously sized - definitely not skimpy. The top sheet, again in my opinion, is too wide and almost goes to the floor and hangs way longer than the comforter. I am going to have about a total of 12 inches cut off. These are just things you may wish to consider when purchasing them. In general, I'm pleased with them and consider them a great value."
3,disappointment sheets,"These sheets are good quality, BUT they are not a standard size. the top sheet is way too wide, and so doesn't fit under a standard quilt, which really ticked me off. I would not buy them again."
5,Great value,"Nice, substantial fabric that was soft to begin with, but has only gotten softer with several months of use. So far, very durable and comfortable."
2,Not comfortable or soft,"Like some others, I am really disappointed in these sheets. Maybe the quality has deteriorated over time with a cheaper quality being sold these days. Anyway, they were not soft and not comfortable and got worse with the second and third washings.... After that off to goodwill they went."
3,Pinzon 400 - Thread -Count 100& Egyptian Cotton,"Looked good on line. Looked good when I received it but after the first wash, it didn't have much appeal. It is still okay but for the price....I expected much more"
4,Fantastic sheets!,"I got these set in Plum, about 5 years ago, and I do agree with comments about how scratchy they are when you purchase them, but after a few washes they are amazing.I've use them frequently, but during summer cause they are heavy and perfect for chilly weather.The color stays intact through the years and they are an amazing quality, everytime I use them It's like having brand new sheets! I love them!"
3,WRINKLES WRINKLES argh,"My husband prefers Egyptian Cotton and due to us upgrading to a king bed, I had to make the purchase. Lovely sheen, mind you, but always washing my sheets before using...my smile turned into a frown upon unloading the dryer. Oh the WRINKLES are horrible...any suggestions other than ironing? Hectic lives call for easy care...help!!! :("
2,For me their rough,"They look good. But for me who sleeps without pajamas they feel very rough. My wife doesn't have an issue. We put them downstairs for our guest beds so it does not affect me any more. Went for the Costco sheets which feel great and are about the same price, style, color etc."
1,what a big disappointment..,Other reviewer were right.Nothing felt like egyptian cotton.feel very itchy and rough.I washed sheets before putting them on our bed so I don't know i can return them.I wish i could...Do not waste your money on this.
4,Nice sheets!,"$160 sheets for $60? Yes please. They have detailed stitching which looks quite classy, and they're just solid to put it simply. We were using sheets that we could see through before this, so it's a very nice change."
5,Yes they are soft.,I really like the sheet set. I will buy these again as needed. They are soft and feel cool. The color is as shown.
4,Pinzon Hemstitch 400 threat Count King Sheet,"The product is of decent quality. No defects, sturdy material, nice color (Eggshell) and soft. All we expected. We like it and recommend the product."
1,Not happy,"Nice sheets, or so I thought. The first time I washed them they shrunk badly, and I faithfully followed the washing instructions. Now the fitted sheet takes two people to force on, and the pillowcases are so shrunk I can't use them.I will not buy this brand again."
2,not up to par,was looking for that particular color when i chose Pinzon. The color was perfect but that all that was perfect. the material is ruff to touch even after laundry.. not what i expected from 400 count Egyptian cotton.
3,Kind of Disappointed,"First the good: I love the Maize color...a very nice yellow that was just what I wanted. The California King size fitted sheet fits my mattress perfectly. The top sheet is even Cal. King size.Now the not so good: The sheets are very heavy. They are not soft, but scratchy. They do not even slide with each other...they kind of stick together.Bottom line: I love the look, but hate the feel. Maybe they'll soften up with age."
2,Meh.,"The product does not seem like real Egyptian cotton... If it is, then it's probably not actually 400 thread count. The sheets are rough, so I'm hoping they soften up with use and washing."
2,Very stiff and not soft,"I would not recommend these sheets and after 3 washings, wished I would have just returned them. There is no way this is Egyptian Cotton."
1,Not Soft!,"I read the reviews and expected to receive a nice, soft set of sheets. Instead, these sheets are extremely scratchy. I washed them twice and let them soak but still scratchy.I will attempt to return."
2,Much to rough,I was very disappointed in these sheets. The color faded in spots the first time they were washed and they do NOT feel like 400 thread count. Much to rough... especially the pillow cases. Definitely not worth the price.
5,"Great price, very soft","I haven't had these very long, but the quality appears to be very good, with sturdy stitching. The set is very soft, even before the first washing."
3,Go for the 500 Thread Count,Spend the extra money for the 500 Thread Count of this product. I have the 500 Thread count of this product and I am very happy with it.
5,Great Deal,I am very pleased with my purchase of these sheets. What a geat price for the thread count. Thank you amazon for another good quality item!!!!
3,Wrinkles!,"Not a bad product considering the price. Sheets are sooo expensive! My complaint is not about the softness (they are okay), but rather about the wrinkles when I take them out of the dryer! I'm not one to iron my sheets (I have 3,000 other things to do), so they look terrible on my bed. Be forewarned."
3,watch out for shrinkage!,"Well I absolutely LOVE the color - it is beautiful! But I followed the directions on washing them and the pillow cases shrunk! I can't get my king pillow to fit - darn it! As far as comfort and wearing, I don't know yet, but I'll check back in as time goes on...here's hoping!"
3,Nice not exceptional,These sheets are a lovely blue color but are pretty average sheets. Other 400 count sheets I have purchased have been softer.
5,Great Value,What a difference thread count makes! I have only this 1 set of 400 thread count sheets. The others are just your typical low quality blends. The only problem is that I hate when it's laundry day and I know I have to switch to one of my old sheet sets...I love these....can't go wrong with the price.
4,Very comfortable and good value,"I loved the first set so much that I purchased a second set. Very smooth and comfortable for a great night's sleep in any season. And the price seemed like a good value compared to similar sheets sold by other retailers. The only drawback is that these sheets wrinkle -- and keep the wrinkle even after ironing. But they feel so good, it's worth the slight inconvenience."
4,Deep color and substantial,"We purchased two sets,king sized. Both are substantial in feel and the color is exactly what I wanted. It appears to have a golden sheen that gives depth to the chestnut brown. The sheets fit well on memory foam mattresses. They are comfortable but not super soft which is why 4 stars instead of 5."
3,"very soft, beautiful colors, but these sheets smell","I bought two sets, one for myself and one to give as a gift. I took my set out of the package today and was pleased at the quality of the fabric and the color. The sheets are beautiful and very soft. I aways wash sheets before use, and these sheets came out of the washer with a very noticeable petroleum-like odor. I put them back in the washer for a vinegar soak followed by second wash. They came out of that second wash smelling only slightly better. Third wash: I used borax in the wash and added vinegar to the rinse water. Smell is barely noticeable now but I wonder how it will be to sleep on sheets that have an odor similar to gasoline--even if the odor is just barely noticeable now. Hopefully over time and many washes this odor will be completely gone. I deducted two stars from my rating because I cannot give the other set as a gift due to the odor."
1,These sheets don't last,"I bought thee sheets for my son to go to college with last august 2009. He had several sets of sheets with him so these were not the only ones he used there. At first they worked great - they have elastic all the way around on the bottom fitted sheet - so they stayed on the slippery plastic coated mattress pretty well. Then the elastic gave out half way through the school year so they became unusable. I called Amazon who distributes Pinzon and they said that they only have a 30 day guarantee. Since it took longer than 30 days - around 90 - to wear out the elastic, they will not consider returning or replacing them. These will be the last linens I purchase from Amazon."
3,"Mediocre, at best","These sheets are mediocre at best. They definitely aren't that soft. I tried to wash these once to see if that would help, but it didn't. Now they are rough AND wrinkly. I'm glad I didn't pay full retail for these or else I would have returned them. At a discounted price I can live with them, I guess. Yea they are Egyptian Cotton, but they are made in China, probably on some cheap mill somewhere. Don't expect much with these."
1,So uncomfortable!,"I was really excited about these, but was disappointed to find that they are like sleeping on sandpaper. The color and bed fit was fine, but the material is terrible. I have washed them multiple times, and tried fabric softener. Maybe there is something I am missing... maybe they get softer over time, but so far they are horrible. I had trouble sleeping on them because they are so uncomfortable' It's completely ridiculous. I read recently that thread count does not really determine quality of sheets despite common beliefs, and that companies can claim a higher thread count, by counting threads between the threads and there is no real regulation for it. These sheets seem to prove that discrepancy, and have been cast away to the basement."
1,Like sleeping on straw,"I read the reviews of these before purchasing, and saw that some customers remarked these are pretty scratchy, however, others said that by soaking the starch out of the sheets, they would be soft. When they arrived, they had a nice sheen & felt pretty smooth, so of course I threw all the packaging away. I washed them, soaking for 30 minutes to remove any statch and was excited to use my new sheets that night. After taking them out of the dryer, I was horrified to feel how scratchy they felt! I put them on the bed anyway, and didn't make it through the night with them on. They are incredibly scratchy that it feels very unpleasant to have any skin contact with the sheets. I'm very disappointed. =("
1,these sheets are NOT soft,"I washed them before putting them on my bed, and they are still so scratchy I'm taking them off this morning and putting an old set of sheets on. Very disappointing. I'd return them if I could...don't waste your money."
1,They pilled/balled up within a month...,"After reading review after review, I selected these sheets as the best bang for my buck. These sheets have great reviews, but I wish I had noticed that the most popular reviews were written six years ago! Maybe they were better back then. The first few weeks we just loved the sheets; they are very soft and at the same time feel sturdy. We did not experience the problems with them being scratchy that others have had. Unfortunately, after the first washing the sheets started to pill/ball up. It got worse and worse, and within a month, we could no longer use them because they were a sea of little balls. I expected more from the Amazon/Pinzon brand and am really disappointed. It's obvious that there is very little consistency in the quality of these sheets. Save your money and go with something else! Amazon, please note that this product needs to be improved!"
1,burlap,sleeping on these sheets are awful..used a ton of fabric softener and they feel like burlap...itchy scratchy...thought they were a high thread count and egyption cotton....more like leaves than cotton...wish i could return them...so very disappointed....
1,bleached splotches galore. loses color upon 1 wash.,"I bought these sheet set in eggshell and just popped it into the washing machine upon receiving it. I followed the instruction and used cold water and used my meyers all natural detergent. After 1 wash, I see bleached spots on both the fitted and flat sheets. and by bleached spots, i mean HUGE splotches of white against the eggshell color. This certainly did not happen with the other stuff in the same wash cycle. I generally do not complain about stuff I order via amazon because I'm usually shopping for a deal, but seriously, this is pretty ridiculous."
2,Not soft!,"I've tried everything to soften these up. Baking soda, vinegar, hot water soaks, enzymes. Nothing works. They wrinkle terribly and will never be soft. If you want crisp wrinkly sheets, you will love them."
3,Good quality but not for deep mattresses,"Ordered a Queen set of these because reviews seemed pretty good. They advertise it as fitting 18"" mattresses. We have a 16"" mattress so I figured it should be good to go. When they arrived I checked them even before washing. The pocket seam measures barely 15"", nowhere near the 18"" they describe. I tried them anyhow figuring maybe the pocket seam doesn't ride up to the top corner of the mattress, thinking maybe this is where they get the 18"" fitment from. No luck. I had to wrestle with the fitted sheet even to stretch it over the final corner and then it wouldn't reach to the bottom of the mattress. That's without washing or drying which would make it worse. Ended up returning them. Quality seems good and the material feels nice. It's unfortunate the description isn't right. Sam's Club sells a deep pocket 450ct for forty bucks so I may give them a shot."
4,Sheets,"They fit my very deep mattress well, wish they were just a bit softer/silver feeling. The color and sheet weight is good. Overall I would buy these again."
5,400 thread sheet set,Very soft and sturdy bed sheet set. Queen size. Very nice on my bed. Should have bought another one. Thanks
5,Very Happy With These!,"I got them about couple of months ago in white. I am very happy with them. They fit my queen mattress very nicely, not too loose, not too tight. They are deep enough to fit my Tempuroedic mattress. They are very soft to the skin and feels very comfortable. I washed them once and that didn't make any difference to the softness :). I was so happy that I got another sheet set in Cream color from them. Would definitely buy again in future.The shipping was quick too."
1,Chemical Smell,"No stars for this product. They had an awful chemical smell when we took them out of the package. We washed these sheets 4 times with everything we could think of, and the smell did not wash out."
1,Reeking of some chemical,"Worst purchase ever from Amazon. The color wasn't even close to the way it looked on the screen but I could live with it, more of a taupe than it looked on line. The main problem is that they reeked of some sort of chemical, something like a really cheap perfume. I should have just returned them straight away but I figured I could wash them and get rid of the smell which I did but it took four washings with a great deal of Oxyclean and vinegar to finally get rid of it. We will see how it goes from here but right now I am wishing I had bought the ones at Target for the same price, better looking quality, and no stench."
2,Shrunk dramatically after first wash,"I was pleased with the look and feel of these sheets until after the first wash. They shrunk so much that they no longer fit our queen-size bed. Obviously, these sheets did not meet my expectations and I am very disappointed."
3,Pilled after 6 months,"Sheets were crisp at purchase, but softened after a few washes. However, after less than 6 months of use, the fitted sheet has started pilling. I've never had a sheet do this before and am disappointed with its quality."
4,"Right size for hospital bed -- and comfy, too","My husband is used to our very smooth, cotton sateen sheets on our regular bed. So when he broke two vertebrae and we needed to rent him a hospital bed, he wanted to lie on equally comfortable sheets -- but we didn't have a set in a twin size. And he could hardly go out to shop and feel the fabric quality for himself! So we took a chance and ordered these from Amazon, partly influenced by the reviews already written for them. Fortunately, they fit the bed and felt great. If only they'd arrived as quickly as we expected, they'd have been perfect! Still pretty good, though."
4,A Medical Adventure,"This book has adventure! An inspiring read for any medical student. Dr. Lemke shares riveting case histories that could only occur in the bush. The use of tupperware implant to treat a paralyzed eye -- the need to argue with natives in sign language not to leave the operating table while cut open mid-surgery -- the dilemma of providing treatment to a culture with unique but life-threatening traditions. As a medical student, I appreciated reading through Dr. Lemke's thought processes while having to ethically and medically navigate the need for unusual treatments. Dr. Lemke also makes astute observations about how African tribal lifestyles prevent many diseases common in western countries such as tooth decay and appendicitis. In addition to the medical aspect, Dr. Lemke shares an incredibly open-minded portrait of Cameroon's somewhat unknown native tribes."

2,Pretty and nice for the first 3 months,It's been about 3 months and the paint at the top of the lighthouse has begun chipping away while the paint on the sides is starting to bubble. I have a freshwater 10 gallon tank. Temp is about 80 F.
1,Nipples-Cartoon Boyfriend,"This album is not my taste. When I first heard the album I thought I was listening to the same song over and over again, because the songs all sound the same. The only song I like on the album is ""Leather"". I can really relate to that ONLY song. The others are like childs play, they may be about reality, but not every day life. I like albums that have experiences of every day life. This album is for the younger age, such as 12-15. YES...the lyrics are somewhat mature, but the album to me I would advise for a younger audience. I have seen them perform at local clubs, and their on-stage performances ROCK! I think they are hitting it big, but yes the album sucks. Many bands work only on stage and I think they are awesome on stage. I have been to about 6 of their gigs and I truly enjoy them."
1,Bogus,Don't waste your money. The originators of this just used it as a venue to hear themselves speak. If I could figure out how to get my money back I would.
4,INDIA,"A very well done book on a fascinating subject. The text is very interesting and the images are well conceived, the exterior and interior photographs are equally well done. India is blessed with amazing buildings and these palaces certainly reassert this fact. India is a land influenced by centuries of invasions by foreign forces and they all left their mark on her. These influences have made for stunning buildings and amazing architectural styles. I high recommend this book to anyone with any interest in India or just fascinating architecture."
5,A good family story,"This was a good book, and it is easy enough for younger children to understand when you read it to them. For on-their-own-reading, it would be in my opinion, for ages 8-9. Personally, my favorite story was the family contest, in which each child had to perform an act of bravery, I think bravery, anyway, it showed the readers, or listeners, good acts to do, and it showed with a good act, comes a wonderful reward."
5,Short stories worth 6 stars.,"If I only could, I would give 6 stars to this small book. These short novels are absolutely fascinating; those are the stories of love and death, grief and happiness, desperation and hope. The heroes of Anna Gavalda , like all of us, try to cope with every day life, struggling, trying to survive. They wait for hope, love and happiness - even for only five minutes of it. Do you think it is boring? Open the first novel, and I guarantee that you will not close the book until you read the last sentence of the last novel. The world of Anna Gavalda is mesmerizing and captivating.""Aimez Vous Brahms?"" If you do, if you lost yourself in the atmosphere of Francoise Sagan books, welcome to the Anna Gavalda world!"
3,NOT A BOOK FOR THE DEPRESSED!,"Though this book certainly touches on various emotions, I would hardly call this book entertaining. Most of the short stories in this book are unsettling/disturbing, & quite depressing. The writer does have a unique style that keeps the reader wanting to read on but, most likely, in hopes of finding a happier ending. Perhaps there is a cultural variable that causes this book to be viewed and appreciated differently by people from different parts of the world.I would NOT recommend this book to anyone really depressed because I believe it could push them over the edge.I would recommend this book to people who are not looking to be entertained but who like to read short stories that capture a range of human emotions (mostly negative emotions)."
5,Galveston: A History of the Island,Excellent Book!! We will be giving several as gifts this year. The service provided in processing our order was superior too. Thank you!
2,very dated,I looked forward to this book and after a long delay it came. I was very disappointed from the description I thought it was a new release. I was an old library book from the 80's that was discarded. Yes it has ancient history but really is outdated. I lived in Galveston for 15 years and just moved and it is way out of date.
3,must have for the IG fan,"While not as good an overall offering as some of their other efforts, this CD has some funky jams on it and lots of the humor from the first release."
3,real good but not the best,"this is a good album from the infectious,two real good cover songfame from bowie and imigrant song (amazing cover) from zepplinsome out take record from the first album and some good live track!if you like infectious you will love it but it not as good as grooves family cyco!!"
2,Not the best considering price,"I was disappointed, after a few hundred miles of use the gold paint started to peel off. Feels more like a 99c store product. Also, they are huge and have bones on them, though the pic shows just a skull. Get something metal or anodized instead."
4,A modern day version of the Carpenters from Ireland.,"The Corrs are three sisters and a brother. They are vocalist-Andrea, drummer- Caroline, violinist-Sharon, and keyboard-Jim. The Corrs are from Ireland and have reached platinum status in their homeland and in addition to being big in Europe. They have yet to achieve notoriety in the U.S., however In Blue may change that. If you liked the pop of the Carpenters or Captain and Tenille, then you should like the Corrs. These are catchy pop songs with a little Celtic flair - great for driving or just plain listening."
4,ABSOLUTE CORRS.......,"CORRS ARE BACK WITH A 3RD STUDIO ALBUM!IN BLUE CONTEINS 15SONGS WHICH ONE BY ONE ARE SPECIAL!!! THE GREAT LEAD VOCALS BY ANDREA, MAKES ""IN BLUE"" A HIGH FIDELITY ALBUM!!! ANDREA SAYED AT A RECENT INTERVIEW:""WE CONSIDER THIS(REFERING TO IN BLUE)OUR BEST ALBUM SO FAR."" IF THAT'S TRUE I'M LOOKING FORWARD FOR THEIR NEXT ONE!!!...."
3,Mr. Shania Twain should have stayed away,"I agree with the reviewer who lamented that ""In Blue"" is overproduced--it is. Too much fluff and not enough substance. However, the Corrs are good enough to pull it off--almost. ""Breathless"" is fantastic; ""No More Cry"" is fantastic, and ""Radio"" is almost there. The rest of the album sounds like something that could have been produced by anybody from Shania to Christina Agueliera. The disappointment is that the Corrs are better than this. With their formerly distinctive sound of pop and folk, mixed with beautiful and innovative song writing as evidenced in their previous alblums, ""In Blue"" is a disservice to the Corrs--and it could have been avoided if Mr. Shania Twain would have kept his ""mutt""s off of the Corrs and let them be. What he turned them into is another mainstream fluff act, an Irish version of his wife Shania."
2,Boring!,"My introduction to the Corrs was a live show with Bono which I enjoyed. I happened on this CD and took a chance. I think I must have seen a different band. I guess that despite their known dislike of Americans, they decided to go top 40 to cash in. If not for the pauses on the CD, you might have a problem distinguishing one song from the other. Nothing clever, interesting, original, or worthwhile. Truly a waste of money."
4,if you are a corrfan you have to have it,this is a really wonderful album and i love all the songs especially breathlees that is fantastic.The music and how they play is very different that the others albums.You can hear a song with the corrs feature with alejandro sanz a spanish singer
3,"Corrs get 5, the Songwriter, 0","The first time I heard this cd, I absolutely loved it! The music is enchanting and mellow and Andrea's voice is spellbinding; however, the more I listened to this, the less and less I liked it. The lyrics are empty and predictable. I hate to say anything bad about the Corrs because they are extremely talented and their sound is nothing short of amazing. I hate giving this cd a 3! The music is enough, I just can't sit and listen to words that sound like they were written by grade schoolers...I have to block out the lyrics to enjoy this. I would really like to see this family take off and take over the entertainment industry...after they get a new lyricist...I know they would win everyone over with more interesting and mature lyrics, and they will get the credit, and 5 stars, they deserve!"
1,You know what this will sound like already.,"As you know exactly how predictable this album will be I don't think I need to say much more about the music. The Corrs are about as entertaining as Chris De Burgh without his unintentional humour. The only thing that is remotely interesting about them is the fact that they are inexplicably very popular in high street fashion retailers like Top Shop and H & M. I have pondered upon why this should be so for some time, but I think it's probably because they motivate people to buy pants."
1,Who listens to this crap?,Awful Irish band. Then save for Van Morrison has there ever been a great one?
4,Buy This Girl Music and not any from The Go Gos,"Great pop album that is well worth your time instead of running out to buy that all lameo ""has been"" girl band The Go Gos new release. while The Corrs have great melodic hooks and cool harmonies - The Go Gos just have Belinda Carlisle plumped up on Krispey Kreme donuts and som way bad songs. So run for the corrs instead. girl music at its finest."
4,New Wave?,"I also bought this album on the strength of ""Breathless"", and there's more great dance grooves where that came from in ""Irresistible"" (the 2nd single), ""Give Me a Reason"", ""Radio"", and the very Ace-of-Base-ish ""Give It All Up"". The slower songs are also very nice, and while perhaps a bit overpolished in places, I found the album quite enjoyable.Ever since New Wave died out in 1985 and technopop sank by 1990, I've struggled to find artists I like, short of buying the continuing albums of the old guard (Depeche Mode, Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, etc.). And there was little in the 1990s for me to like in this vein except for momentary surfacing of electronica (e.g. Republica) in the mid 90's. The Corrs are much more organic than any of those acts, but they're the first act since Republica to make me sit up and pay attention.I'm sorry fans of their previous albums don't like this one much. I found it a wonderful, accessible introduction."
5,Full of Corr-isma!,"We've already been to two wedding where ""All the Love in the World"" has been used as the newlywed couple's first-dance song. That is a true testament to the emotional power of this album. It has replaced old standards like Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, and in my book it is quite the righteous choice.The rest of the album lives up to that initial promise. My favorite tracks (like ""One Night"", ""No More Cry"", and ""Rain"") easily mix sentiment with beautiful melody, brought home ably by Andrea Corr - a woman whose physical beauty is only exceeded by the beauty of her voice. She is a pop star of the highest order, reminding me of the emotional connections I made to such prior songbirds as Dolores O'Riordan (The Cranberries) and Sinead O'Connor.Buy the album, put it on the stereo, and relax to the mellow, romantic sounds with someone you love. Trust me, it's great for those moments."
5,Brilliant pop melodies and key changes merit 5 stars.,"Although the ballads have a somewhat conventional and uninspiring flavor, the faster pop selections are exceptional. Breathless, Irrestible, and No More Cry are great songs. ""At Your Side"" is in a class by itself, a song so good that it can make you skip around the room and cry at the same time. And of course the girls in the band are heartbreakingly beautiful, which makes the whole experience that much more fun."
4,Not their best...,"...but boy are they photogenic!seriously though, I feel this isn't as good as their earlier efforts - it has lost a lot of the traditional Irish influences that made them stand out from the pack.And the presence of Mutt Lange is not a good thing. Breathless is a great song, but Shania Twain could sing it and it would not be any different. That is to say, it is a generic pop song, it is not a Corrs song.If you must get a Corrs CD, get Unplugged (or get Unplugged on DVD - THAT is what DVD is for - beautiful women and beautiful music!)"
2,Dissapointing,"I first heard the Corrs on their MTV Unplugged Special and was amazed at the tight harmonies and wonderful sound. When the new album was released I had great expectations, but what a dissapointment. It is so overproduced and has such a ""Euro pop"" sound that the uniqueness of the group is lost. I don't think the push towards this sound is going to bring much success.If you want to hear the Corrs, buy the Unplugged Album"
2,What happened to the Corrs?,"I have been a fan of the Corrs for roughly 3 years now. And this album is not Corresque at all. It is standard teenybopper trash in my opinion, with the exception of All in a Day and Rebel Heart. If you like standard american pop, buy it, you'll like it. But if you are looking for something remotely Irish like the Corrs used to be, buy The Corrs Unplugged, or Forgiven not Forgotten, or any of their previous albums. But since I know the Corrs are in this to make money, I'll give them credit with 2 stars as opposed to 1."
3,In Blue Review,"I have been a Corrs fan for quite a while and they are just excellent live, they sound just like the CD. But I found this album to be completely different to what I thought. It has very little of the 'Irishness' or lyrics that meant anything, which made The Corrs unique. It's just so over produced and commercial. Mutt Lange makes it sound too much like Shania Twain and not like The Corrs at all. It is still a good album but not as good as Talk On Corners which is one of the best albums of all time."
3,Could have been better,"In comparison to the band's other albums, In Blue falls quite short...at least to me. I know that the band wants to break into the US market but I don't think having Mutt Lange co-write a few songs with them is going to help them, especially with their long-time fans like myself. I love the band and have been since Forgiven but Not Forgotten but In Blue just tries my patience with drivel like ""All the Love in the World"". Now I'm a sucker for a good ballad but that is just not one of them. Songs like ""Breathless"", ""Irresistable"", ""At Your Side"", and ""Radio"" are my favorite tracks on the cd. In comparison to their other cds, In Blue ranks at the bottom of favorite Corrs cd. Unplugged is ten times better than In Blue. Despite my harsh criticism of In Blue, I will never, ever stop listening to the Corrs. They have been and always will be my favorite band."
3,In the blue,Very good cd the only problem there are about 3 or 4 songs that we don't for that much but that's with most cd you now days but we like most of the songs
2,"So much potential, but too much gloss","Okay, I'm going to offend the legion of Corrs fans around the globe, but I really wanted to enjoy this release. Really. But the glossy, over-produced material (especially the Mutt Lange tracks that sound like Shania throw-aways)fails to let these gorgeous ladies and their equally gorgeous voices come through. For a band that sounds great in a live setting, their studio work leaves much to be desired. I had also hope for more Celtic-influenced tracks, but most of these make me recall the slick, soulless drivel that was once Wilson Phillips. While there will be hits off of ""In Blue"", it's not a CD that's going to leave a lasting impression."
1,Directionless,"I just listened to this CD for the fifth, and probably the last, time. Don't get me wrong. I love the Corrs. Unfortunately, this collection of three and half minute, non-Celtic influenced, disco drum machined, techno-pop just isn't the Corrs. With each album, the family moves further and further from the roots which helped influence its unique sound. But for brief...and I mean brief...interludes in Give Me a Reason and All in a Day, one would never even know the group was Irish. They're Forgiven, Not Forgotten, but this is the last one I'll buy if they continue to stray."
3,Plenty of used copies of this,"I saw the Corrs on some cable channel concert and kinda liked them. This cd didn't do them justice--it's too canned, too produced, too nowhere. The single Breathless sounds great at loud volumes, but the rest of the tunes never take off. I bought mine from a used dealer for a buck. With postage it left me wondering if I'd ever buy another Corrs cd for the same price."
5,The best CD ever!,When I bought the CD I had only heard 1 song and by the end of the first week that I had it I had memorized all 14 songs. It honestly is the best CD that I own.
2,Disappointing...,"I chose to review this version, 'cause ""Judy"" is probably the best track included to this cd. Others I like are ""Rebel Heart"", ""Hurt Before"" and ""All In A Day"". Okay...it's a good pop album, only a ""little"" over-produced, and it does have some good songs. I don't wanna start about ""Give It All Up"" (Corrs fans know what I'm talking about), then the new versions of ""Radio"" and ""At Your Side"" are less good than on ""Unplugged"". Another good track is ""Say"", a nice piece of work that really has a great intro AND outro. I'm sure a lot of people will like this one, but if you've heard ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"" and ""Talk On Corners"", then you'll (probably) agree with me."
5,Absolutely Awsome!,"So far, the best CD they have made! I was impressed with thier other CDs, but this tops them. BRAVO!"
1,Phoned it in.,"I caught the Coors on a televised concert performance. The music seeemed refreshing, interesting, and pleasant. So I tried the ""Forgiven Not Forgotten"" album. I liked it. The only weak point for me was the fact that so much of the songs involved repeating the same lyrics over and over. By itself a small point and on the strength of the album I bought the next, ""In Blue.""""In Blue"" takes this repition to new heights of monotony with any redeeming features. It's like disco without the thumpa thumpa dance beat. There is nothing new or fresh about the music, lyrics or performances. It's as if this album is made up of the ""B"" sides of the songs on the prior album. Nothing inventive musically is going on. Nothing clever in the lyrics, lyrics, lyrics, and nothing original in the performances. Whatever ""magic"" they had before seems to be gone."
4,"good cd, but it's lacking","Okay, I'm a die hard fan of these guys, I love their music, BUT this cd is lacking something i can't put my finger on. Something ""Talk on corners"" and ""forgiven, not forgotten"" had but this one lacked it. Still great vocals, great songs, etc. But it just doesn't go into me and send me somewhere far off that they ususaly do. But it is a great cd, if it wasn't for that one little thing, i would have given it 5. By far, i think, the best 3 tracks are: ""All The Love In The World"", ""No more cry"" and ""Rebel heart."""
2,Stick with the Older Stuff,"I was first drawn to the Corrs because of their unique ability to blend conteporary pop with traditional Irish sounds. Their CD, ""Forgiven, not Forgotten"" is beautiful. ""Talk on Corners"" was good as well. However, I was disappointed with ""In Blue"". ""Breathless"" is a great song no doubt. And the rest of the CD is enjoyable, but it's just not The Corrs to me. They're trying to be too American and I don't like it. I was always amazed at how they could entertain Americans while holding on to their Irishness. They made beautiful music. ""In Blue"" is just an attempt at being The Backstreet Boys. If you have been a long-time fan of The Corrs and are planning to purchase ""In Blue"", be prepared to be disappointed."
1,Blame Mutt Lange!!!,"Wow!! Long time ago, the Corrs was the best thing to come out of Ireland since U2. But then enters Mutt Lange, who tries to turn these beautiful Irish people into Americans with this weak offering. Stick with their older material. Trust me!!!"
3,In Blue a bit too mainstream,"I should first make it clear that I do like this album. As a great fan of Celtic music, the marriage of both Celtic and modern style (as is so evident in ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"") was shat first attracted me to The Coors. ""In Blue"" just goes a little farther toward to modern and leaves the Celtic influence more hidden in the background. It's a nice group of songs, but just lift my Celtic spirits quite as far."
4,The Corrs Review,"This CD is awesome, but the vocals ae a little more whiny than in their previous albums. (Their first album ""The Corrs"" is the best one.) The last track ""Rebel Heart"" is an awesome instrumental piece. It's a little repetitive but the violin work is amazing. ""Breathless"" and ""No More Cry"" are upbeat love songs that anyone would love!"
3,Almost Great,"Take the Corrs band and mix them with a great American record producer and you have an irresistible album. Unfortunately this is not that kind of album. I love their voices (and they are easy on the eyes), but for real, this album is sickly sweet euro pop-a mix between the soft side of Sinead O'Connor and the edgier side of Olivia Newton John. I would have bought the album anyway but I hope they work with better producers in future. They are 85% of the way there-with the right production oversight easing up on the sweet and inserting a stronger bass line, they might just become a hit in the US."
2,I hope its not all downhill from here,"I love the Corrs not just for the sisters beauty but their music. I remember a time when I heard Irish Celtic music coming from them, but not here. This has been popped up production wise. The unplugged verisons of these songs are amazing. I recommend getting their actual Unplugged cd, but this is [bad]. I like a few songs, but I feel embarrased listening to this cd which isn't a good sign."
2,Irish folk sound is lost!,"There is no culture in this album. I got it with hopes that it would be catchy yet orchestrated with strings like their previous album ""Forgiven Not Forgotten"" but no, I take a listen for the first time, and I find almost no strings. The fiddle or violin solos that I loved so much in FNF are nonexistant and the lovely irish drum is barely used. The drums sound more like a drum machine than anything else, yet I believe it is a drumset. If you're looking for songs like ""Closer,"" this album is not for you, because the Corrs turned over their talent to someone else and fell to the radio desires of the masses. In conclusion, I was highly disappointed and have lost respect for the beloved group of talented siblings we all call ""The Corrs."""
1,Disappointing,Forgiven not Forgotten was a truly amazing cd that had a really unique sound. The music was beautiful.This latest CD (In Blue) was a huge let down. Every song sounded the same except for Breathless...I couldn't believe the band would allow this cd to be released after the oustanding job they have done on the first album.
4,A very good album,"I am an everyday teenage guy. I listen to my fair share of rap and pop, and I dont usually like this kind of music. But as soon as I heard the first 5 or 6 songs of ""In Blue,"" I knew I had to have it! It has fast and slow songs, and are not all about love. I strongly recommend this cd, especially the songs ""Breathless"" and ""all the love in the world."" Check it out, I am sure you wont be dissapointed. I took a risk in buying this album, and it paid off. I think you should too!"
4,In synch with In Blue,"I have a slightly different version than this, but it is the same songs. I fell in love with The Corrs with Talk on Corners, and admittedly, they stray a bit away from their Irish lyrics toward more mainstream pop culture. That definately doesn't take away from their performance on this cd though. Every single song from Breathless, (It certainly left me that, and the music video...WOW) to Give me a reason, and Radio (which is one of my favourites) I like the Spice Girls too, but I were to compare the Spice Girls vocals to the Corrs? Corrs, 10 times better hands down, even though I like both groups. Now, if you wanted a cd that introduces you to the Corrs, this is the one. It's like nothing you've ever heard before, and you'll fall in love with them. I guarantee it."
1,Rip Off,"First of all, there was only 2 movies on this disk, instead of the 4 they list. Second the quality of the picture was sub-standard. I wouldn't waste my money on buying another dvd from this company or another harlequin collector set dvd for that matter."
2,I only have 2 movies on the DVD not 4,I am very disappointed in Amazon. There are suppose to be four movies on this DVD but I have only two...Diamond Girl and Loving Evangeline. When I tried to leave customer feedback for the seller it wouldn't allow me. Diamond Girl wasn't bad but LE left alot to be desired...I love Linda Howard and have read all her books but this adaption was a total waste. So if anyone from Amazon bothers to read this review...I would like to know how to get a correct copy of the DVD since I can even leave you feedback.
2,Very disappointed-missing 2nd DVD,"I'm extremely disappointed in this DVD. It's a collection of 4 movies of which I wanted only 1 but figured the price was right. Upon arrival there was only one DVD in the sealed DVD box and it did not include the one movie that I had originally wanted. I purchased two other of these 4-film collector's sets and they both came with two DVD, just this one was missing a second DVD. I've not investigated as to whether Amazon will send a replacement, but this shouldn't happen."
4,Very good!!,The Harlequin movies are all very good. I enjoy watching them. They are a bit sappy but very good entertainment value for the money!!
4,Hikes and Walks in the Berkshire Hills,"The guide is clear and descriptive. It provides levels of difficulty as well as a time table for each hike or walk. I recomend it to anyone who will be visiting the Berkshires for extended periods of time and really enjoys getting outside. Great for those who live in Boston or other urban areas of eastern Massachusetts and want to explore the other side of the state on weekends.There is one complaint. In my opinion the walks in the book are a waste of space. They may be suitable for the disabled or catch the eye of the wealthy that visit Stockbridge and Lenox..But overall a joke...If you are not great with maps and figuring out your own hikes from topo then this is your book...Your only book... The William College Outing Club in Williamstown, Massachusetts also has a nice guide. I believe you can get it over the internet thru the college website. Visit the Berkshires...Buy a book..Go for a hike!"
5,one of my all time favs,I used to manage a music store many moons ago & we received this as one of our promos. I instantly loved this CD. Every time we would put it in rotation at the store we'd sell out. Unfortunately there was limited backing from the record company and no commercial air play. This is a great hidden gem.
4,solid,"this is a solid alblum by the legendary Wailers. You will notice that the music is still there and very strong. Will look forward to their next cd. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss the opportunity. Their newest lead singer as well as the band put on an unbelivable higher energy show then you may expect... Rasta"
3,The Wailers Band...not the same Wailers.,"If you are looking for a continuum in your Bob Marley, Wailers, Bunny Wailer or Peter Tosh collection, you're looking in the wrong place. But, this is certainly a nice Reggae record by some of the best."
4,You'll be surprised how good this is!,"13 years after Bob Marley's passing, the Wailers released this CD featuring some of the players who played with Marley. It's really a good CD and each time you play it, it grows on you. Good vocals from Junior Marvin, strong backing from the band, and some catchy tunes.I had a chance to see the Wailers live in 2004 in Atlantic City. That band bears very little resemblance to this band. The 1994 band was doing original material exclusively on this CD. The 2004 band was strictly doing covers of Bob Marley's more popular songs. So this is a document of a band that you cannot see any more."
4,Good Nightlight,"Love the stainglassed look. Not cheap at all.Actually a little heavy because of the the glass used.Nightlight is a little brighter than I would like. So we use it in the bathroom.Husband loved it too, it was a present for him and he loves nightlights, has them all over the house."
5,Excellent Instrumental Collaboration,"Actually, this is more like 4 stars, but I snuck in a bonus star because this disc put me in a good mood.If you're a fan of Jeff Beck's instrumental works, you'll probably love this disc. Much of the music is etherial stuff that evokes a sense of space and combines a sort of new-age lax attitude with subtle tension. Elements of bands like Shadowfax, Dire Straits and even a touch of Pink Floyd linger here and there in the keys, but the guitar is pure Beck. The flow of the disc is excellent, as is the sound quality. All in all, a real sleeper."
1,Cimarron City! 2 DVD - Collector's Edition Embossed Tin,"I received the Cimarron City Collector's Edition Embossed Tin. I made the mistake of reading the reviews in which it was stated there were three disks in one review, and two reviews both stated there were 12 shows on these DVD's in the collector's tin. There are only two DVD's, and a total of 4 shows. Two per disk.Don't waste your money. But another set, not the Collectors Tin. I learned to read the basic report and do the math as to the minutes on the DVD. The reviews were very misleading and cost me money I didn't need to lose. If I am wrong, I would really like to know how the reviewers in questions found 12 shows in this set?"
4,Great Classic Westerns,This is a one series I don't remember but it is a good one. It was very interesting to watch. the quality of DVDs is pretty good. Picture is a little light at times but still very watchable. We liked it.
2,Cimmaron City...slightly dissapointing,"I was dissapointed that firstly, there were only 12 episodes on the box set and also the fact that they didn't appear to be in chronological order. For someone viewing this for the first time, as I was, it made it really disjointed and you didn't get a sense of continuity or getting to know the characters as you would if you watched a series in its entireity and in order. I get very cynical with 'best of' box sets as this would seemingly appear to be designed to be ( although I have heard that there were much better episodes not included - 'Blind is the Killer' for one) particullary if there is an intention at a later date to release the show in its entireity. I think if you are going to release a one season show like this, its not helpful to just release a few episodes - I really think it should be all or nothing. Have to say I was very dissapointed as a result."
4,Memorable TV western from the golden era,Cimarron City will remind you about what was graet in early TV westerns. The stories were short morality plays that were easy to follow and the good guys end up on top. Cimarron City pretty much follows the formula but adds a splash of characterization which lifts it above other westerns of the period. It is aslo fun to see Dan Blocker before he became Hoss.
2,Caveat emptor!,"While it is nice to have decent copies of episodes of this classic western series, the information provided was at best incomplete. The item description did not state how many or which episodes were included. I purposely bought this specific collection to have a copy of the ""Terror Town"" episode from year one. One lengthy review listed this as one of the specific episodes included. Mea Culpa! Each disc has only two episodes, and neither disc had the episode I wanted. This whole problem could have been avoided if the description had provided more complete information. I'll know better next time!"
1,Soft Science,"First of all, I am not trained as a scientist, but this is ""soft science"" even to me. The premise that the heart is ""a"" or ""the"" center of human intelligence is interesting to consider, but the fact that the author emphasizes that all ideas are copyrighted to his company over and over leads one to wonder how much of the research results could be replicated. Wouldn't a true research scientist be trying to entice others to study the subject instead of trying to own it? Very few other sources of support for the theory are cited. I wish the data were more compelling, because it is an attractive theory."
2,The HeartMath Solution falls short on hard science.,"The HeartMath Solution is an admirable work generated for the ""self-help"" audience. As a researcher in heart rate variability, I found it unfortunate that the real value of this work is lost in its self-serving style. A great deal of the research cited was generated ""in-house"" and provides the bulk of the scientific ""validation"" for the highly trade-marked and copyrighted procedures presented. Additionally, as a reader,I was very disappointed at the overt marketing content which seems to reduce the perceived value of this potentially important area of study. The HeartMath Solution falls short on hard science and, because of its self-referential style, is reduced to a very long brochure for the HeartMath Institute's follow-on commercial programs. Considering the altruistic nature of the subject, I can't believe that this is the book that HeartMath really intended to produce."
3,So much potential....,"The ideas behind this book are earth-moving -- but the type font is so bad that the book is almost unreadable. Also, the prose is so uninteresting that even fabulous ideas become boring. This book deserves to be rewritten and reprinted. The ideas could change your life -- but you will have to work hard to absorb them from this edition."
5,Squirrels love it!,"This arrived in only two days, and was as advertised.We put it up on a tree that we can see from many rooms of the house, so that we can enjoy the antics at any time.The squirrels figured it out within a half a day - it's easy for them to use, and they love to sit on the top to eat their nuts. Sometimes when we forget to fill it, they will munch on the wood, but we figure at the price, we just replace it once a year.Nice buy!"
2,Great Idea.,"This Squirrel feeder has a great idea behind it but it doesn't take into consideration one thing and that's the squirrels will eat the wood to get to the peanuts. I've had it for a couple of months and its destroyed. I went out to Petsmart and bought the same Idea in Metal,it will last longer."
5,A MUST FOR ALL ANIMAL LOVERS,"I'm very pleased with this squirrel feeder. I fill mine with p-nuts. It's fun to watch the squirrels trying to figure out how to get the nuts out of the box. Some squirrels are quicker than others, but eventually they all figure it out. I will buy more of these feeders in the future."
2,Squirrels don't use it.,"The squirrels in my yard must be incredibly stupid or lazy. They use this feeder to sit on, but have not bothered to figure out how to open it. The corn and peanuts inside remained untouched until a smarter raccoon came along and cleaned it out. I give up!"
5,Wowww!,Harry Connick Jr. recorded this album when he was 11 years old!!! Awesome! What a genius! His piano playing is excellent and his vocal fantastic! I definitely recommend this album to all Blues/Jazz music collectors and fans. Don't miss it.
4,Lovely motherboard,"I'll be honest, I've owned this motherboard for a couple of weeks and I still haven't enabled all of its features. This is as fully packed a motherboard as one can imagine at it's price. And being Asus, it's fully customizable.That being said, a purchaser will wish to visit the Asus website for the latest drivers and bios, especially if you're installing the Conroe processors.Why not 5 stars? The documentation is sketchy in parts (but sufficient to get you up and running)."
5,Asus has been good to me.,"This motherboard was a replacement board. It does not have all the bells and whistles, but it has been a good motherboard. I have had it for over a year, not huge complicatioins. Works fine, thats all that matters. Price was right too."
2,RAM Clipper Broken,"I bought this Motherboard on 27th of December 20007, unfortunately when I received this motherboard on 08/01/2008, one of the ram holding clippers was broken. I can't send the item back because I live overseas! And it will cost me a fortune to do that.I am very unhappy with the quality of this product."
1,Wish I had read the reviews,"I bought this in a hurry over lunch and am sorry for it. Kelly freakin' Clarkson! Boring, badly mixed with insipid lyrics... this is kiddie-trance. That's it, I am not buying any more US launched trance albums. Imports or nothing. Even iTunes knows the difference... instead of electronica or trance, it categorized this under 'Pop'! arrrrrrggggg!"
3,Not as good as 2005 annual,"I still listen/work out to the annual 2005, but this year was a bit of a disappointment, not to mention annoying that the track listing is different from the one I received. The only silver lining is that I finally have Black Fras - Moving into light. Which is a great song."
2,typical MOS compliations - lame,"Not even going to say anything in detail, you know why it is normal to be some what disappointed with their stuff. CD 2 is better than CD 1 which is so bad and contain some of the cheesiest tracks, that it won't get a single star rating."
3,Not all that...,"...bad. If you are diappointed with this version, get the Australian version (also available on Amazon). It's different and is excellent! I'm putting 3 stars as compared to the Imported version that's all it is. Last year's import was much better also."
1,Ministry fails once again...,"Ministry of Sound used to be great here in the US like 5-6 years ago when you couldn't find any trance CDs anywhere; and most of what you could find was bad. Probably their last OK release was Annual 2002. This one continues their weak performance with sorry ""pop"" style songs. If you don't go to clubs, never heard of any DJ on the thedjlist [website] top 100 list, or like songs mixed from '80s tunes? Well, you might be ignorant enough of good trance to actually like this. Otherwise, check out: Markus Schulz (!!!!!), Gabriel & Dresden, and maybe some Armin Van Buuren for the good stuff. I'm glad I didn't buy this MoS trash."
3,Well...disc 2 is alright...,"This really IS not a good annual...well if your starting to get into House/Dance then you might enjoy this compilaton...i'ts a ""Starter Annual""Disc 1 is too cheesey with songs from Kelly Clarkson, Alicia Keys, and Cascada...it's pretty mainstream...and well the remixes of Turn On The Music & Raindrops are HORRIBLE! honestly...only good songs on disc 1 are ""Love on my Mind,"" ""Your Body,"" & ""I Like the Way.""Now Disc 2 is ok...not many cheesey songs...and some good trance from Armin...but the remix of ""Darkside of the Moon"" is just horrible...bla bla bla...no details...well to get to the point~ dont get this if you already have an Annual 2006 from another country...cause chances are that the one you have is 10 times better than this one!"
1,Back to the 80's,"This is perhaps the worst Ministry CD I have ever heard. Not sure what has happened to the music/club scene in the UK, but this is like a time warp back to the 80's. Not good. Save your money and dig up Annual II & III and listen to them instead."
2,Very Dissapointed,Ministry of Sound as others have mentioned is usually awesome. This time around I purchased the CD without sampling it first and I am very dissapointed. The music dosen't go with the style that they usually release in the Annual's. Have to say I am very sad because my husband and I looked forward to the release of this CD for months.
1,Probably not the right cable for you,"This cable has TWO FEMALE ENDS. This is very unlikely to be what you need, unless some special circumstance applies to you. Normal monitors have a femal attachment. Normal computers have a male attachment. Normal monitor cables have a male side and a female side. KVM switches mimic this, having a female attachment as a monitor would. Unless you have some unusual setup, find a different cable."
3,Gag wears thin quickly,Comparing baby to a vehicle was funny maybe the first couple of times but then it just got annoying. There's some decent information here but you do have to wade through a whole lot of nothing to get to it.
3,Not as useful as hoped for.,"While this book looked like it would be useful, it fell short of that. Its hard to navigate to the section you want and its not user friendly when it comes to writing in it. Original concept though."
2,Not particularly helpful,"Compact and cute, with lots and lots of places to record just how often your child defecates and urinates and what color its eyes are. The novel hook is comparing your baby's record to a maintainence log on a new car. Office visits are ""service records"". Some handy boxed tips, a couple of graphics, but very little information. Probably better for the glove compartment than the diaper bag."
5,GREAT BABY BOOK TO RECORD 1ST YEAR!,COLORFUL WITH LOTS OF SPACE TO WRITE IN. LIKE THAT IT IS NOT LIKE THE EVERYDAY BABY LOG. GREAT & UNIQUE WAY TO RECORD BABY'S FIRST YEAR.
5,High quality in all respects,"Picture and sound quality are very good and if you are thinking of getting this but are worried about that, don't worry. If you are a Weather Report ""freak"", and by that I mean you don't just dig them because of Jaco and Heavy Weather, you have to have this. Caught at a very early experimental period of the group this is very adventuresome music that you don't really get to hear on any major labels anymore. Very much in the style of their first studio album and Live in Tokyo. Too bad it isn't longer. Get it."
1,Don't wast your time!,This is unquestionably the most worthless collection of pages I have ever read. It consists of very brief factoids strung together with meaningless chatter.Do not buy this book if you want to learn anything about how to make large or medium format photographs.
3,I think he knows where Syd Barrett lives...,"Virtual one-man band Kurt Ralske (aka ""Ultra Vivid Scene"") has definitely worn out his early Pink Floyd albums. This album of textured dream-pop (with a rough edge tossed in here and there) should please you if you enjoy a little psychedelia mixed in with your alternative. Standout track: ""Mirror To Mirror"",an atomospheric and insidiously hypnotic number. This is definitely one for the headphones!"
4,"""How Sweet"" it is.","It's kind of depressing to know that only 1% of the population has heard of this band, but I'm happy to be one of those that have. I actually like the other two albums more than this, but ""Rev"" is still amazing as well. This album was a great alternative to ""alternative"" in 1993, though it would be catagorized as such. As much as I've listened to this through the years, I can't think of anything to compare it to. But know that getting this is well worth it just for ""Thief's Love Song"". It's hypnotic and beautiful like most of the album is. Some copies of this come with a 4 track bonus disc too."
4,A good introduction to Campbell,"This is an accessible book that highlights some of the basic thoughts of Joseph Campbell about myth. Its readability comes from the fact that it is a dialogue between Campbell and Bill Moyers on ideas and theories of myth and religion. As such it is a more readable, but perhaps a less complete book than Campbell's ""Hero with A Thousand Faces."" Given the choice of beginning with either I would begin with this book, then move on to the other. There is some discussion of the Star Wars myth-making, but it is intermittent and not very sustained. One of the chief advantages of this book is that it highlights some of Campbell's insights on myth and religion, and its primary disadvantage is that the dialog format (which makes it accessible) also lends itself to meandering digression. Attentive students to Campbell's thought will glean some significant insights, nonetheless."
3,Good only in parts,"This book is a mixed bag.On the plus side , Campbell draws attention to myths, which are important in our lives.He also mentions the need to look inwards to the intangible worlds.But I find him to be just a bit too glib.He snatches at myths from all over the place, sampling a bit here and a bit there.This is a negative feature of New Age thought, which treats myths and religion like consumer products.He takes the Eastern quietest position by ignoring the social dimensions of life.When he says you can't do anything to change the world, he ignores that people are influencing the world all the time.The powerful exploiters certainly have a great impact in shaping the material world in which we live.People can change themselves and the world at the same time.This book offers a few tasty morsels, but not the sustenance of a full meal."
3,"The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell, et al","I began reading JC books in the late 80's and could not get enough. The PBS Series still holds my interest and attention.Having lost my copy of the original transcripts I purchased this edition without regard to the Editor and find this edition and this editing misses something from the original.I am sure it will serve many that are unfamiliar with JC, but I want the un-edited version as it changed my life forever."
3,the power of myth,"I didn't realize that this book was a transcription of the tv series, or I would not have bought it. Difficult to understand Campbell's thoughts and meanings. Disjointed, I think."
4,Other Books,"A more popular look at myths and mythology, using this format to relate Campbell's studies and other works to mythological type influences that we see today, even in major media and popular culture or entertainment situations.When Campbell points it out, you sometimes realise what you are subconsciously missing."
3,Amazing Mythological Comparisons,"This is written in an ""interview"" form. I probably would get more out of the DVD format. It has very interesting comparisons of our life to mythology. Although very interesting, some ideas seem a little far-fetched."
3,A very good read,"I got alot more out of this book than i thought i would. i often reflect back to this book and new ""clicks"" happen for me by comparing cultural myths and beliefs. If this book is read in the right frame of mind you can see alot of a bigger human spiritual picture out of it. This is a good read for a tired after work weekday night. Not hard reading soft and entertaining. I would recommend it."
1,"Only Similarities, No Differences","The greatest problem with this book is Mr. Campbell's insistence on looking at myths only through their similarities and never their differences. This creates a false view that a universality exists within the world's myths. He also makes claims that he provides no evidence for. Occasionally, he makes self-refuting statements. For example, Mr. Campbell knows that he doesn't know or that something exists and doesn't exist at the same time in the same way. This book is less than helpful.However, this back-and-forth with Bill Moyer helped me to see how Mr. Moyer came to his currently held world view...and I only feel pity for the man. (I do not mean this in a condescending way.)"
3,A dangerous bag of magic,"This book is undeniably appealing, but be careful: myths are a product of the lower rational mind, as philosopher/scientist Jurgen Haberamas has shown. It is the same mentality that produces the rediculous Christian mythology which the readers of this book are rebelling against. Cambell admits that 99% of myth-involved folk believe the myths to be LITERAL. The other 1% are mystical, transpersonal people who are merely expressing their experiences in the format of a myth as a tasteful way of expressing the eternal. So for the rational Westerner, this leaves us with lovely myths which merely correspond to a mystical region which we can at most intuitively sense is sort of there. So what do we do? - read Ken Wilber and start meditating to get to the place where we understand myths to be an expression of the eternal. Think you're there already? Think again. Meditate."
5,This book will change your life,"I am currently reading the large, beautifully illustrated copy of The Power of Myth. If you read with an open mind, this book has the potential to change your life.The universality and the history of religion is all told clearly and concisely by Mr. Campbell with insightful questions by Bill Moyers to break up the narrative.This work has changed my life: we have come from the same background and all of our religions point to the same beginnings.The unity of all life is celebrated in this amazing book.I believe everyone should read Joseph Campbell and be transformed.I cannot recommend The Power of Myth highly enough. This is probably the most important book I have ever read."
3,Good overall book,"This is a good book, but not really what I expected. Most of the information in it seems pretty obvious. I found myself skipping ahead because certain sections sounded way too fluffy and filled with air. While it's easy to read, it doesn't seem very solid in terms of the information provided.It's a case of too much information in too little space, so it feels like he's just touching on the subject. There are very few stories and studies to back up claims made throughout, and there seems to be no real focus. The author could have done a far better job if he had dumped half the material and focused on his core formula.I still think Cialdini's book is the best on the topic. If I could rewrite this book, but maybe I'm biased because I've been studying persuasion for quite some time now."
4,Wish I'd had this book 20 years ago,"Let's just say that Dave Lakhani's background makes him uniquely qualified on the subject of persuasion. (I won't spoil it. Just read all about it in Chapter 1, and boy, is it harrowing.)It's really no accident that a lot of what Mr. Lakhani discusses in this book are the same ingredients required to make it in Hollywood. Creating persona, telling a story, desire to believe--these and other of his components of Persuasion are intrinsic to the star making machinary of this town.What's so astonishing is to see all this potent material collected in one place, and to see it augmented with such pithy advice and practical tools. Chapter 14 alone, ""The Persuasion Equation,"" is worth the entire price of the book."
4,Persuassion Influencial or Manipulation,I think this book helped me to understand more the approaches that are faced in my personal goals as well as recognizing techniques used by others in business and how to's being persuasive vs. manipulation. Good read.
1,A waste of time and money!,"I bought this audio as I preferred to listen rather than read. But I found myself rewinding and playing the audio over and over, not because the subject is interesting, but because you can't understand what the author is saying as he speed reading. I barely understood what he says to the point I've given up after five minutes of listening to it. To the author, slow down, there's a reason there's a period (.) at the end of the sentence."
4,Great first reader!,This book is great for a child learning to read. It adds some challenging words to the mix. The story although does repeat the words over and over it does not repeat the same sentences over and over. Which helps to make it interesting for the beginning reader. It has become my 5 year olds favorite book.
3,"Very simple, yet sweet book","What a delightful story with an excellent message! This was a very light read with simple characters, simple plot, and predictable ending. At times, I found Samantha's dialogue to be a bit repetitive and almost annoying. For those looking for a sweet story with a happy ending, June is perfect. However, if you're seeking a thought provoking book with complex characters and a suspenseful plot, this book probably isn't the best choice."
3,Poor Read,"I read the first book ""Faith"" and thought this one would be as good. It was not. It was a rather boring storyline and I hated all the English jargon from Sam."
3,Ok read,"This was an Ok book.I enjoyed the spiritual themes, but it would have been nice to know more about Parker. It's an easy read too. Nice clean romance.I would recommend to anyone who likes Christian inspirational fiction."
4,Great book!,"I liked the book very much. The way it is written is great, you go through the story quickly. When you laid it down, because you need to do other things, you want to get back to the book, to read the rest of the story. I liked it to learn more about the west and about mail order brides. Maybe there is some fiction in it all, but still I guess it gives a good idea how life was back then."
4,A good way to spend an evening!,"Lori Copeland once again weaves a beautiful tapestry of old West history, steadfast faith in God, and old fashioned romance. A light-hearted story about disappointment, starting over, and happy endings. If you're looking for a warm way to spend a cozy evening reading, you've found it!"
3,Not as good as some Christian novels,"This series by Lori Copeland was enjoyable, but not the kind of books I would see myself reading over again several times. I may revisit the characters again. I think I have more of a frustration with the inconsistencies of each character's past."
2,"FYI: Mouse is actually the size of a pingpong, not a tennis ball.","Mouse is actually the size of a ping pong, not a tennis ball. I think the picture is slightly misleading.However, as far as the Kitten is concerned, the Jury is still out."
3,A nice read of a nice time in history,I bought this as my dad was in the CCC and I wanted to learn more about it. It is a very specific book about this authors experiences - not a general book on the CCC. That being said it was worth reading - interesting stories although a bit mundane at times.
5,"""It's twew! It's twew!""","(4.5/5 stars) I would have to agree with previous reviewers that Dietrich shows more singing ability here than in latter year English recordings when she toured with Burt Bachrach. In those recordings, she sounded very much like Lili von Schtupp, Madeline Kahn's merciless parody of Dietrich in ""Blazing Saddles."" Though still not great, she has better range on most of the recordings in this collection. She shows great instinct for pausing and doesn't over sing the songs. She is at her best when singing sultry torch songs with ""come hither"" lyrics, such as on ""Peter."" As a person who speaks German, yet lives in a country that rarely appreciates contributions from ""Old Europe,"" I appreciate having recordings like this available. The only gripe I have about this collection is the inclusion of ""Good For Nothing,"" which seems out of place as a novelty comedy song among standards and love songs. Aside from that, great."
4,...,"it's a wonderful collection for the most part, but there's a track or two that grate on my nerves, especially 'Peter'I can't be certain why, it's just one of those things...I loved how this album had both the german and english versions of 'lili marlene' as 1)it is beautiful in both 2)they have very different sounds, one is mournful, the other more energetic and 3)it's nice to know what she's singing about ;) (don't speak german...wanted to take it, but my school only offers french, spanish, and italien...)Would have liked a few of her more lively songs also though, to balance out the sound. This recording's great to cry to and all, but Marlene Dietrich also did several livelier songs, such as 'boys in the backroom,' 'maybe i'll come back,' and 'lola' which would have added alot to this compilation."
4,Lady of the FREE,"This Lady hasn't got a BIG voice but understands with very good arrangers how to interpret a song. Most of all I love her for being an ANTI-Nazi in Germany's BAD history phase with this idiot-devil from Austria. She, the Blue Angel, was the voice for the FREE! & tolerant people. I wished she had the possibility of nowadays technology in music."
5,So easy!!,"It comes with everything you need (except the little bit of sugar you're supposed to add after the pearls are rinsed, but that's not a big deal - I just mentioned it for accuracy), the pearls are easy to fix and the instructions are easy to understand. The shaker is also quite sturdy, so it can be cleaned and used again. :o)"
3,Bubble Tea Party Kit,"I loved the drinks. I had been wanting to try this for a long time and this was the first time I found a variety pack for a reasonable cost. The shipping is pretty high though. Unfortunately I bought this specifically because of its variety and there must have been a problem in the packaging because it only came with one kind of pearl tapioca. ZERO COMPANY RESPONSE. I tried writing the company three times over five - six weeks and NEVER received a reply. At first I wanted to exchange it, then return it still no response then I asked for a refund from Amazon (Very high marks for Amazon)End of story. The drinks were great, especially for the novelty factor. Questionable if the shipping is worth it. The company's consumer support is non-existent. I would buy the drinks again; just not from this company."
5,Easy and fun to use -- great gift,I gave the kit to my brother as part of a final exam care package. He raved about it and had a lot of fun sharing the bubble tea with his friends. Makes a great gift and is priced very reasonably. The shipping was the most annoying part.
3,More work then I thought!,Tastes good but it was more work to prepare then expected. The taste was ultimately very good. Nice variety of flavors.J
3,It's not TEA,"I love bubble tea. But note the name of this kit-- ""BUBBLE AND PEARL DRINK"". Just note that it isn't bubble tea. I have it and it's cute and fun-- the shaker's good to have, the cups are cute and it has what you need, but it's just powder and water with non-sugared tapioca pearls. It lacks the sweetness and really isn't anywhere near as tasty as the real stuff."
3,Not nearly as good as the real thing.,Not nearly as good as the real thing. The favors in the kit weren't that great either. Overall I was dissipointed.
4,This product is very comfortable,"I saw this product before, some years back when I owned a Colt 1991-A1, Compact Officers Model. The grips were able to tame down the recoil with there soft rubber & with the finger grips you've got complete control of the gun, so I bought them again! Using the same caliber (45 ACP.) on a larger full frame gun Sig-Sauer P-220, I wanted the same feeling. I'm happy to say that they work Very Well! Installing the grips were OK, they did require a little tweaking to align the screws to fasten to the frame. But, all in all nice grips!"
5,Original Asian Furniture & Decor,"The 9.5"" Diameter Chinese Fish Bowl stand was just what I had been looking for and met all expections. Reasonably priced."
1,Larger size is shipped when they didn't have the size I ordered,"I ordered a 9.5"" chinese fish bowl plant stand. I received a 10.5"" stand. When I called I was told that they ship the next size if they don't have the size a customer orders. I couldn't use the larger stand and returned it. I was refunded only the cost of the stand and had to pay shipping and handling fee and the return postage. They should not ship a size I did not order."
1,"Uh, no.","This book has one good thing going for it. It has the most popular names listed in order of location (ie.. northeast United States, southwest...., outside US...). Only 64 out of the almost 400 pages were useful. The other pages just list names (no meanings, no origins)"
5,"A treasure trove of extensive, fascinating name data!","This book will provide unlimited enjoyment for people intrigued by names and naming trends. It contains an astounding variety of unusual names, and no other name book I've encountered approaches its diversity and thoroughness."
2,Baby Name Countdown,"This book definitely has a lot of names, but it is overwhelming and hard to use. There is a decent listing of popular names and their meanings (although the details provided regarding origin, alternate spellings, etc. are very sparse), but the section on unusual names is nearly useless. There are thousands of names, printed in very small print, with no information about any of them (origin, meaning, etc.). I regret buying this book because there are much more reasonably priced books that do a much better job of guiding your decision."
5,"Names , Names , Names , Names and more Names",I great collection of creativly spelled names I have 3 copys I love the meanings and the listings in popularity. It is number 2 in my top iof the top list. I Found my favorite boys name because of this book. Tarquin I wish mister lansky would add it to his books. Oh well!
1,More of the same,"I've been living in the Long Island area for years and it's painfully obvious that Little Buster is an artist with very little to say. This new album is like his live shows--same old songs, same old performances. Avoid at all costs unless you are into treading water."
1,Waste of money,The acting was at best high school level. The stories were boring. I had forgotten how bad the fashion was in the early 90's!
3,Harkequin Collector's Set V. 1,"Not bad for the price. I enjoyed one story in particularly. The acting on some stories were not that great, but entertaining."
2,Missing two movies,"There should have been two disks, only had one. Missed two movies. Thank you for asking. I tried to explain to customer service - that was not easy. This was first time I was disappointed with Amazon. I had othered other disk, actually, quiet a few, they were all just fine. I really enjoyed them."
5,product satisfaction,at first i was missing one dvd leaving me with half the movies but the return and replacement of the volume was quick and all four movies were in the replace volume.
2,Harlequin Collector's Set V.1,"I've now watched all 4 movies - 2 two-sided discs - and have to say they were just okay. They are older movies but I did recognize at least 1 actor/actress in each movie. Be aware that all contain some nudity that would have them rated R, but they do not contain the R rated language. I hate movies that are not rated or at least have an indication of what to expect. These movies were like watching glorified soap operas.I guess if you like the old Harlequin romance books and don't mind the added nudity you might enjoy these. I give them a 2 out of 5 stars. Not impressed."
5,Moog is the best.....,I bought this item and by just looking at it you know it's a good quality!! My truck suspension handles just like perfect!! It was a great buy!!
3,Nice try,"Hard hitting investigative reporting. I think not. Flunked out of Yale, two drunk driving convictions, riding the coatails of other politicans, fathered a child to stay out of Viet Nam. This so called bio is nothing more that a frustrated whinning reporter venting his views. The end result is that Mr. Cheney has been in power even with all of his faults. So whine on."
1,Is this fellow's last name Moore?,"This guy's picture does not show a resemblance to Michael Moore but many of his claims in this book are just as undocumented. It's too bad this book didn't come out ealier before the campaign. Then it could have been used as a referecne guide by Dean and Kerry. Also a film could have been made that would have been great food for the hungry liberals who would eaten these lies. Fortunately, the gullibe people who wee taken by Moore won't fall fo this rubbish. I am returning my book."
5,This book was fabulous!,"I absolutely loved these stories. All were excellent and demonstrate the power of true love. If you want a great read, look no further! These stories will chase the winter blues away for sure."
1,Subscribe & Save,Our little guy likes it just fine. My issue comes with the formula no longer being issued in the Subscribe & Save program. We'll just get it from the store now.
2,Corn syrup solids and sugar as ingredients,"If that is your cup of tea, go for it. For us we had better results with Good Start and Earths Best."
1,High Fructose Corn Syrup is the Number One Ingredient!,There is now a link between Autism and High Fructose Corn Syrup. I am so disappointed in this product and that they would promote giving this to babies. It may work for gas but the long term affects could be way worse.See this link for more details.[...]I do not normally write reviews but feel everyone considering buying this product should know this. Read the label.Erin
1,very bab product,"My son was on that formula,he had bab colic he would throw up from his moutth and nose i had to change to good start soy which he tolerates well, this milk is not good for newborn"
4,Works best for my baby,"This formula has worked well for my child who did not tolerate regular similac which was given at the hospital. However, people should be basing formula decisions on conversations with their pediatricians not amazon customer reviews. FYI it can take up to two weeks for a baby to adjust to a formula change"
5,Good for lactose intolerent babies,"My baby was very gassy and acidic when she was born,and still is. Iam lactose intolerant so I Figured she may be and tried many baby formulas including soy based. None of them helped until I Found the similac milk based lactose free formula(similac sensitive)My baby was so much more happy and her symptoms are gone. I have even switched back to other formulas to make sure and she always gets sick . My baby is only allowed to drink this formula are the lactaid milk that I drink.She is now one years old and wants no other type of milk. This is a very helpful formula."
4,Amazing!,My son is 9 weeks old. I have been breast feeding him since birth but his gas and spitting up has become out of control. I am going back to work soon so I was ready to switch to formula and tried this per our pediatrician. She said it was most likely a lactose sensitivity and the thicker RTF will help him keep it down as well.He has only had a few bottles and I can already see an amazing difference! Barely any spit up and if he does its just a small bit. He is much calmer and happier after a feeding as well. I tried to breast feed him last night as I am trying to slowly dry up and he spit up a good 10-12 times. So I'm done. This product has helped is tremendously. Highly recommended
1,Glorified Computer Printout,It feels nothing like a real poster. The paper feels like Computer paper with a semi gloss on it. The image on the printout is pixelated and not worth the price of shipping. I'm highly disappointed and think they should remove this product.
5,what a fun read,I was just in vacation in key west and picked this book up. it was an absolute blast to read. a true look in to what its like to live in key west. if you are planning to visit or thinking about moving there i would highly reccomend picking it up. i hope they choose more city's to write about in the future.
4,For Key West aficionados,"This is a ""How To"" book. The authors give us tips on how to quit your job (and a questionnaire), they haven't actually done this themselves but it makes for a good read. They tell us to ""not burn any bridges as we may want to go back to the grind."" Hmmm... not true adventurers then. Still, for us Key West aficionados, a good hook."
3,A good beach read...,"But not what I would call a complete guide on how to give it all up and move to ""paradise"". Don't get me wrong there are some helpful hints in here, and it is a humourous read, but if you've been to Key West any number of times, you probably know everything included. It is at least worth the price to buy the book and leave it lying on your desk for everyone to see!"
2,"Good for a gag gift, not legitimate advice","There's no real advice. It's a great gift to give someone who loves key west and dreams of quitting their job, but there's no real value or information in this book other than the cute aspect of a cute gift."
4,adorable,I purchased as a gift for my daughter and cannot wait for her to see it.. Very nice quality and life like
5,Stuffed animal or home decoration?,What a cool Cheetah! It looks just like the picture and could be a childs best friend or a beautiful decoration for you home! It was delivered on time as promised. My 17yr old daughter going to love it!
4,Very cool,"nice addition to our melissa & doug collection...no shedding...no failed stitching...overall, very good...only ding that prevented 5 stars is that he won't stay sitting up on his own...seems a bit off balance, so we have to lean him against something to keep him upright"
3,plush cheetah,"My granddaughter loved this cheetah, but the stitching came out of the tail in 3 different places the second day she played with it. It is soft and cuddly."
3,Life sized and adorable,My daughter loves her cheetah and literally dropped to the floor in amazement when she saw it next to the tree on Christmas morning.
5,Super cool and life like,"My son loves cheetahs and totally went nuts when he received this from Santa. It is huge and very real looking. The only complaint I have about it is that it doesn't always want to stay sitting up by itself, sometimes we have to prop it against the wall to get it to stay up. And I wish they were not so expensive. Really cool gift that is different and looks great in his room."
5,"Love the product, love the value.","My wife and I were shopping in Baby Stores in North GA and came across this product, at almost twice the price. We loved them, so we bought the tiger. When I got home I found the stuff animals here at half the price, I could just kick myself. It just set our little girls jungle room off, we just love it."
4,"Great Cheetah , Life size","Yeah , my daughter found it first at Toys'r'Us with a price if almost $70 . Hell no I am not paying $70 for that , then we found it here , so the price made me decide , can't find it with a better price . Shipping came so fast I , I couldn't believe it . Overall , I think is a good product , my daughter is obsessed with Cheetahs , so I can't say no , she knows all the facts about it . Better a toy , then a real one at home , right ?Thank you LuckyKids"
2,Works fine... with a French Maid's outfit!,"I love my garden. I use tools in my garden. I would happily buy a product that holds tools & seeds & weeds the way the toolbelt I use at work holds tools & fasteners. In fact I use an old carpenter's tool belt just for this purpose. Although not perfect for the garden (it's dark green, leather & heavy!) it seems much better than the choices gardeners are currently given.The Rumford my boyfriend gave me.... Well, I have other uses for both of them!"
2,"Pitiful ""interpretation"" of original book","If you are looking for a reasonable video interpretation of the classic work, don't bother with this dog. It's a disgrace and deviates from beginning to end. Very disappointing."
3,For Vincent Price fans only,"As usual, old Hollywood butchers the story. But if you've never read the book or just want to watch Vincent Price (always a good choice), its a good way to pass the time."
4,A Sign of Things to Come,"Surprisingly effective, this very early effort (1940) by Vincent Price hints at his horror excellence to come. Although there's little true terror here, witness the sudden turn of madness at the end of Clifford's murder trial. Vincent plays it to a T. And if you're looking for something else along these lines, consider ""Dragonwyck"" (1946) from theFox Horror Classics Collection Volume 2 (Dragonwyck / Chandu the Magician / Dr. Renault's Secret), another literary-based melodrama starring Vincent Price made shortly after ""The House of the Seven Gables."" It pairs nicely with this movie."
5,fascinating glimpse into history in the making,"It is absolutely fascinating to read this first-hand account of the humble beginnings of an invention as incredible as the modern-day electric guitar. Two ordinary guys -- Leo Fender and George Fullerton -- set out in the 1940s to create a ""newfangled"" guitar, a solid-body electric guitar. Not only did this pair successfully invent their dream guitar, they immediately set up a production line and watched their dream grow and grow. Virtually every popular musician across the generations, from Tennessee Ernie Ford to Bruce Springsteen, has benefited from a Fender guitar. Remarkable true story about human ingenuity and the fruition of dreams!-- Graciela Sholander..."
4,Works OK,"Filter received not like the stock picture. Works good. Made in China, but whats not these days."
5,"In the end, I got what I needed","We had an issue with USPS not delivering the product, but in the end - Go Vacuum sent me two filters UPS 2 day overnight. They stepped up to the plate and showed great customer service. I will definitely order from them again and so should you."
3,Great Credits but Something Went Wrong,"Great songs and arrangements by Michel Legrand, great lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman. Unfortunately, Mathis established himself as a big singer in the 60's and then stopped. Since the 70's, his albums have covered every bad surprise anyone could ever imagine: cover-hit albums, songbooks on the-composer-of-the-moment and some very rare exceptions which send us back to his best 60's production. This could be one of those exceptions was not Mathis so worried about reaching the highest musical note any singer could ever reach. By doing this, his voice approaches a soprano tone and phrasing sounds dramatically over."
2,Why do people like this show?,"Maybe it is just me, but i don't understand why people like this show. Well, maybe not the show itself, but at least the music. I like three songs on this CD, QUEENIE WAS A BLONDE, UPTOWN, and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE. The first song is good and it goes downhill until track 10, where it is deicent again, and then it plummets back downhill. I don't like the Queenie, the Burrs is pretty good, but they can't compare with the ones from Lippa's WILD PARTY. If you like the story, go but Lippa's, and i can almost gauruntee you will like it better."
1,Plain and Simply.....,"YUCK.The Show was near torture to sit through, but to be fair the CD is less dull. LaChiusa neds to learn something about charisma before attempting another 'show'."
3,"eh, some of this stuff is kinda scary.....","a while ago, i purchased the Lippa version of The Wild Party, and it quickly became my second favortite soundtrack! (my favortie being RENT, of course!) that cd had my Idina and Taye - what could be better?? on a whim, i decided to get this Wild Party to compare to the Off-Broadway production. My hunch was correct: the Lippa version was far superior!!!! Some of the songs on here are just downright silly, and Eartha Kitt does nothing for me on this cd. Plua, Mandy Perkins kinda scared me...Toni was a good Queenie, but she can;t compare to Julia Murney! if you have to chose, buy the Lippa versin insteasd =)"
2,It just can't compare...,"At the opening rehearsal for a show I was in, one member of the cast started out by mentioning that his favorite show was The Wild Party, and everyone should check it out. My friend had a copy of this CD, and I listened to it, but it most certainly did not catch my attention. I found it uninteresting, nothing special. I didn't understand the hype. I found out later that the guy in my show meant the off-broadway version. Then, I listened to the Off-Broadway version, and was immediately fan. This version is just ok. The off-broadway is just so amazing, the broadway version is just...not up to par. If you want some real thrills, check out the Off-Broadway recording."
1,Chiusa or Lippa? Both lose,"I now own two versions of the Wild Party. I guess I never learn. They're very different in every way but charm. This Wild Party is a charmless story set to an irritating jazzy beat sung badly by people who usually sing very well. I know this show has its devoted fans, but I'm not one of them."
5,Another star in the Broadway Universe,"THE WILD PARTY is a great example of what Broadway will have in store for us in the next few years. With witty, quick dialogue and mind bending lyrics, this CD is one that you just have to listen to straight through. The tracks ""Breezin' through another Day"" and ""Wild"" just get stuck in your head and you'll find yourself humming to yourself in crowded elevators.And if anyone complains, ask them if they like great theatre and then tell them to get their tushes out to this show. This one shouldn't be missed."
2,Not my favorite,"I bought this CD after I watched the Tonys and because I am a collector. I did not find any of the songs that interesting or memorable. The first number was interesting in how it set up the musical. The presentations of the characters was probably effectie on stage. The idea of going back to the ""party"" concept of the 30's is something so specialized it may have interest for only a few."
2,Yes but you cant hum the scenery,"Frankly the fondness for this show simply floors me. Why? Eartha Kitt was given the eleven o'clock number and nails it. The rest of the show seems discordant and unpleasant. Not one of the R&H types, but really Marie Christine was the more worthwhile effort from this composer. Brooke Sunny Moriber clearly will get a larger and more significant show than this one. Toni Collet was fine, but the score was undistinguished at best. Some claim its short run was undeserved and the public didn't get it. The public did ""get it"". The run was deserved."
5,The Wildest Party I've Ever Been To!,"What can I say? I saw the show when it was in previews. I loved it then, and I love it even more now. It's become tighter, slicker, smoother. On the CD, the sleaziness of the characters oozes out of the speakers. My God! Toni Collette's voice - a revelation! I'll flock to see her in ANYTHING! The rest of the cast is amazing although Michael McElroy stands out with his rich, sexy voice. If you buy one CD this year, this has got to be it! This is definetly the best new musical of the year!"
3,some really good numbers,"some really good numbers, an enjoyable CD. I do agree with popular opinion it works better on CD than it did in the theater."
5,A must have for anyone who loves music !,Music the way it should be. Mr.Grants ability to transend time is best expressed in this album.The magic of ebb tide or the wide range of the voicals will have you playing the CD time and time again.
3,"great old ballads, but instrumentals poor",Absolutely love THE END and some of the other ballads. Unfortunately the instrumentals are played by an organ and poorly orchestrated.
1,too bad,Earl grant had a nice voice. Unfortunatelyhe is sabotaged here on nearly every trackby hokey arrangements - the organ inparticular is especially cloying.It's too bad when you think ofwhat might have been.
1,"Lame, lame, lame ...","There are two kinds of reviews for this book: the ones written by people who paid $$ to find out how much it sucked, and the ones written by shills for Jamsa and Epic. See if you can figure out which ones are which! Speaking as someone who didn't write this review because my boss told me to, I can say in all honesty that this may be the most worthless book I have ever seen. Period. Whether you're a Director pro, somewhat experienced, or even a rank beginner, this book garuntees to be a 100% waste of your time and money. Run away. Now!"
4,Works exactly as you'd expect.,"This device connects to your Aube thermostat via a two wire interface. It worked exactly as described, but I couldn't figure out how to use this with other equipment other than my thermostat. I also had to disable my answering machine - but I'm not sure if I could get both to work at the same time. I probably should have read the owner's manual a little further. All things said, this worked exactly as described and was easy to use."
4,PLAYMOBIL Office Equipment,"This toy is called ""PLAYMOBIL Office Equipment"".It is very cute and durable. But it had many piecesand putting all the pieces together was like puttingtogether a jigsaw-puzzle, no fun for me to strugglewith. An adult will have to assemble this for a child,because I doubt a child could do it. And I wonder tooabout all these tiny pieces in the hands of a child.But to put on a shelf as decoration, it is adorable.I bought it for decoration. If it is to be given toa child, then one must measure very carefully the ageof that child. A parent should question small pieces.---- Luisa Felix, FelixHoboken@aol.com"
2,Not very good,"Cops and criminals are forced to team up to fight fast-moving zombies it a tenament building. Bloody, sometimes silly, and for the most part forgetable zombie thriller. Occasionally slips into pure camp. Overall a general disappointment."
5,Utterly Incredible!!,"This film gives the ""Zombie Genre"" a whole new lease on life. The characterization of the protagonists is both believable and heart-wrenching as you get to learn about each person trapped in this nightmare. The bloodletting is both visceral and intense. This director should get carte blanche for whatever he wants to makes next, his future is assured."
2,Movie,"You will need a good ear to listen since they are foreign and it shows. It didn't quite come together until a little late in the movie. It wasn't really explained what happened or why. The ""zombies"" weren't typical, but what is in a horror movie? I can't say that it was that good. I liked it well enough to finish it, but the potential for a much better movie was there. The ending was right on target, but left you hanging just a tad. I've seen better, but I've seen worse. You will have to decide if it was worth watching or not."
5,Impressive ending,"While being quite entertaining and somewhat original as this is more of a ""zombie actionmovie"" it did not impress me all that much. Sure, it had gore, funny characters and enough macho attitude to make Chuck Norris seem whimpy but nothing that realy made it stand out.That was until the end carnage, iv'e been a fan of zombiemovies for over 20 years but the end made it all worth it. My jaws dropped, i could not believe my eyes, this is bloodshed on such an epic level not even the lawnmower scene in ""Braindead"" can compare.Like i said, average movie with an amazing ending!!!!"
3,sucky ending,"You know I hate it when you watch a movie and the movie doesn't suck and then the ending kills it. Come on people...the ending of this movie could have been so much better. It's too bad to cause I liked the movie, I liked the fight scenes between the people and the horde, and the old guy cracked me up. And this movie had some gore which is always nice for the gore hounds. I wont bore you with the set up, because others have done that, lets just say cops go into a building for the thugs and apparently hell breaks loose outside and they don't get the memo until it's too late. But if you like these kinds of movies check it out or if you get bored sometime with some time to kill then check it out, but if the ending irritates you, just remember you have been warned."
5,Great product.,"the fact that there's a minimum character count for reviews, makes me NOT want to leave them. 18 19 20"
3,Damn Good,"I enjoyed this slightly different zombie movie made in France. it was well done with a very basic plot with most of the movie taking place in a condemned poor district housing.I wish other were english dubbed like this one, there are tons of zombie movies in the european district I would enjoy watching.worth a watch that's for sure."
4,La Horde is la horrificly bloody and action-packed,"Length:: 2:29 MinsBasic zombie setup, with bloody brilliant results. A serious horror film from France you don't want to miss!"
4,Surprisingly good...,"The storyline everyone seems to use in Zombie stories where most of the story takes place in one setting gets old but this movie did it right.This movie Didn't dwell on people longing and worrying for their loved ones or facing past ""Demons"", it showed them simply trying to survive and get somewhere else.Loved the old Ex-Soldier. :)Hats off to the French. they did a fine job on this movie."
3,Misleading,"This item is misleading. It states that it is the ""Uncut International Version"" but it's actually the same version you can get anywhere else. This version is just under 93 minutes long and is missing the scenes (cemetery scenes and Jimenez beating up a guy in an alley) in the beginning of the movie which are part of the real uncut version.EDIT: Though my comments above are true (This is not the 101 minute UNCUT version) I would like to comment on the item besides this point. As far as picture quality, packaging, and features this DVD is great. My one and only problem was I thought I was getting the longer version."
4,Just What The Doctor Hordered!,"The Horde is a French zombie movie, that's basically France's answer to Dawn of the Dead. Only, it's not as good as Dawn of the Dead. Actually, that's an understatement. It's not even as good as Land of the Dead or Diary of the Dead, in my opinion. But it has plenty of zombie action and gore. The problem is, there is also a lot of scenes that are just too talky. Less talk, more action I say. Still, if you're looking for a serious zombie movie, you could do a lot worse. *cough* Children of the Living Dead *cough*"
4,I will watch this one again!!!,"This movie was quite good, even with subtitles!!! If you are a Zed Head like I am, you should enjoy this one."
4,Great even with subtitles,"The cover art looked interesting so I thought I'd see what it was about. Once you get past the slow intro it was a fun, good paced movie. Didn't think I'd enjoy it that much with subtitles, but I didn't even pay attention to them after a while. The action and acting was enough. Definitely recommend for a fan of the zombie horror genre."
4,Not a bad movie...but ending killed it for me!,"A pretty good movie Im gonna be honest. Decent plot, good action and gore. I cant really say much but the ending really made me frustrated and angry. I won't spoil it so you will have to watch to find out."
5,beautifully made knife!,"Bought this as a gift for my fiance; great idea! He loves it, it's beautifully crafted & just the right size."
5,Tradition,"This knife design, handle color and steel are very traditional. Case has made this knife for about 90 years making it one of the oldest in the catalog. A word of warning: Chrome vanadium steel blades require much more care than the newer and more popular stainless steel blade. If you are willing to do the additional maintenance, they hold an edge better and some claim is sharper.The Case Company is over 120 years old. These knives are made in America not imported from China by a company with offices in America. There is a large collector's market and the knives are highly prized. A Case knife is both an investment and a joy to own. This is something you will treasure, as you will be together for many years."
3,Not the best book for a mixed wedding,"My fiance is Jewish and I am not, and we were looking for a book that explained some of the Jewish traditions in a way that could be used in a mixed wedding. This book, however, is solely for an all-Jewish wedding and assumes a background knowledge about Judiasm that was not helpful for us. For example, we wanted an explanation of the meaning of the breaking of the glass that we could offer up to our guests, but the book just assumed people knew what the ritual was all about and did not offer much language we could use. I did give the book 3 stars because it seemed to be very open to variants of Jewish weddings (for more modern couples), but had no real info of use to me."
4,Fine,"Just so so, It fell over a lot and I was not thrilled with it. The tools are sturdy though and that is a huge plus."
2,Tools broke after 2 months...,"I originally really liked this item, and the wooden handles are super nice, but the tools all broke within 2 months. The handles separated from the actual tool parts. Now I just use them in the ground to prop up baby plants. And my cat loves to sleep on the bag."
2,Typical,Really not a good effort -- very predictable. Needed a lot more action. Best part of Spenser is his smart mouth and his fists. neither were used much in this book.
4,pastime (spenser),I enjoy all of the Spenser books. My only complaint is that I read too fast and they end too soon.
4,I THOUGHT I HAD READ THEM ALL!!!,"You tend to lose track of which ""SPENSER's"" you've read, , ,and, , ,which you have not. This was one that escaped my reading.As PARKER's books go, , ,this was one of the better ones.It filled in some of the blanks in SPENSER's past. You veryrarely ever get short-changed reading a SPENSER!!!"
5,Resonant,"I pick up Robert B. Parker whenever I want a solid plot that comes out of well-developed characters. Pastime is the follow up of ""Early Autumn."" Ten years after Spenser had rescued Paul from his inept parents, Paul's mother has gone missing, and he wants Spenser's help finding her. Their detecting leads them to believe she might be caught in the crossfire between mob figures who don't care if she gets hurt.Spenser is a hound for truth, even if he could get killed looking for the answers. My only complaint with Parker's writing (and I'm nit-picking) is ""he/she/I said,"" tags at almost every line. Although you never have to wonder who's speaking, you have to push the tags into the background to enjoy the otherwise seamless storytelling. Parker writes out of the depth of human character, and his stories always come out resonant."
3,Skinny,"The actual plot of this novel felt more than a little thin, puffed up with a great deal of extraneous information about Paul's and Spenser's childhoods, along with annoying descriptions of what everyone was wearing and what color their garments were. It isn't necessary for a writer to tell every detail about a character or his furniture or his drinks or his food. The story does pick up somewhat in the end, but not enough to save the book completely.The characters are OK--no better than that. Paul is boring. Hawk is a minor figure in this book. The gangsters are OK, with the exception of Gerry who is quite good. Ditto for the atmosphere. Some of the dialogue is excellent, if not quite attached to the plot. Doing tricks and funny asides with the dialogue doesn't mask the thin nature of the story.P.S. I did like the dog. She appears in subsequent Spenser novels."
2,Cd's are actually cassettes,"I am looking for audio CDs and although the product heading states that these are CD's, every vendor in this category states that these are not CDs, they are cassettes. Come on Amazon - do a better job."
5,Wild Life in the Far West - James Hobbs,"I actually bought two versions of this book, thinking it was two different books. One (the copy of the original book), I donated to the historic Putnam Library. The other, a reprint, I kept. It was well written and easy to read. Hard to believe a ""Mountain Man"" wrote it himself. I got it initially because James Hobbs is buried in the National Cemetery here in Dayton Ohio. He was a veteran and in his obituary it said he was Native Indian. We are researching this, as it was known that he did not talk about being part American Indian. He does not name his mother in this book, although he mentions her, and he does not give his twin sister a name, and does not mention her again in the book after he mentions her. He was kidnapped by the Comanches and married a daughter of the Chief.Enjoyable book!"
5,Celtic Thunder DVD,"Excellent vocal and instumental entertainment. Strong, male voices matching the stage setup. This group was featured on PBS. Also, some of the presentations had very attractive females in dance suport roles."
3,Grandmother,Bought this for my grandmother before she passed away. She liked it - it wasn't what she thought it would be.
4,not Irish enough,"Enjoyed this a lot. I would have liked some more traditional Irish music, but I guess it was a reasonable balance. I was gobsmacked by Damian McGinty and the DVD was worth it just to discover this young man. I do not wish to detract from the rest of the group as they are all superb, and each one of them sings at least one memorable solo. I do not watch the show in it's DVD order but I do manage to watch the whole thing over a few nights. The instrumental version of ""Going home"" on this disk is 20 times better than Dire Straits version and twice as good as The Shadows."
1,Boring,"This is a boring DVD. I played part of it, and got tired before I even finished it. I haven't touched it again in 2 years.I do not recommend it."
5,CT the Show,"The only way I can describe this DVD is AWESOME! I have watched it over and over, yet I still love it. OUTSTANDING!"
5,GREATEST MOVIE,All of Celtic Thunders videos are amazing but this is the FIRST and it is amazing. All the songs are great to listen to. Celtic Thunder has a great ranges of voices and talents to listen to. I recommend this movie to EVERYONE!
5,Breathtaking,"Celtic Thunder The Show [DVD]I first saw this show on PBS and thought the music was breathtaking and the five different voices were incredible. I couldn't afford to make a pledge but I vowed I would purchase the DVD when it was released through Amazon. It was well worth it. The songs are heart-wrenching, funny, and passionate and the background extras let you in on the secrets of how the show came about. Four stars****"
5,the best concert,"This is the best concert we have seen in years, and worth every penny. We watch it almost every day the first week we had it. It is wonderful full of real music and very stylish and professional production. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes music, not just Celtic. The misconception is that is it like river dance or Celtic women, not even close. It has all kinds of music, popular, folk, Irish/Celtic, etc. You can't miss on this one, and I'm purchasing it for all my friends for Christmas and suggest you do the same, you won't be sorry. Excellent in all aspects.jj"
5,Fantastic Program!,This DVD is just as good as being there. I was at a concert of theirs in Houston and it was fantastic. This DVD is just as fabulous!!
5,Great Performance,I got this DVD for my son who is 8 and just loves Celtic Thunder. He likes the young Damian and relates to him and now wants to be a singer. He looks at them like he does High School Musical- very unexpected for an 8 year old to like Irish quintet. He also likes the Celtic Women. He will sit and watch over and over. Highly recommend it.
5,Celtic Thunder,"I've watched this DVD a DOZEN times. I never do this!!! I've sent it to 4 family members. As soon as they watched it, they were amazed at the talent of these five singers!!!A cut above!!! THANK YOU."
1,Celtic Schlock,"Ok, I will give you that they have nice voices but have you actually seen the videos, TV shows, concerts?First of all, it is very obvious that they lip sync to people that have paid to see LIVE entertainment, thats the first strike. The pre fabricated stances they take during a song are beyond comical, are they modeling cheap suits for JC Penneys? Thirdly, some of the songs they cover are so covered in sappy commercial non art its hard to listen to it. So, I know plenty of you will still spend your hard earned cash on this garbage, and think I am being too critical so enjoy your large helping of schlock."
2,Is this really Celtic Music?,"Let me start by saying the guys all have great voices and if they were in a good show, it would be wonderful. This is over-produced, WAY over staged, corny, and quite frankly laughable. It also has little to nothing to do with Celtic music. Nights in White Satin? Puppylove? REALLY??? When they did Air Supply's, I Wanna Know What Love Is...I turned off the set. Rent it from your library or Blockbuster first...unless you like corny, over-staged productions. It is too bad they wasted such talent on this dribble...I feel bad for the guys...If they did actual Celtic music and lost the weird stances, the over-acting, an the apparent need to focus on public domain music, they may have a good show. Right now, it is a waste of plastic and silver oxide. (Hopefully Amazon will actually allow my post this time...)"
5,Celtic pride in Celtic Thunder,"What a great DVD for anyone that loves fine male voices - and great backup musicians, too. I've listened to Celtic Thunder before but this is the first time I had ever seen them performing.""A Bird Without Wings"" sang by young Damien McGinty and accompanied by George Donaldson was heartstopping (I'm thinking it would be a perfect song for my youngest son's wedding one day). I had never heard the song before - loved it (can you tell?).I also really liked ""Caledonia"", ""The Old Man"", ""Heartland"", gorgeous version of ""Nights in White Satin"", ""My Boy"", and ""Ireland's Call"", although there wasn't even one song that I didn't enjoy listening to. A big portion of my ancestry is Irish and it seemed I felt these songs (at least the Celtic ones) calling to something inside me. I felt the same thing the first time I saw Celtic Woman sing inCeltic Woman: A New Journey--Live at Slane Castle. We are truly blessed to have such talent available for us to enjoy."
5,Wonderful show,We saw this dvd on netflix and decided to buy the dvd. Watched it again after we received the dvd from Amazon. Enjoyed it just as much.
5,"Celtic thunder ""The Show""","I own this DVD - it is fantastic! As soon as I saw it I knew I just had to see the live show! Their voices and personalities gel together beautifully - and the filming on this DVD is excellent! As is the sound and musicians et al are outstanding. If anyone is hesitating - please do order! You will love it.Elizabeth Lovic, Monroeville PA"
5,Linda,Saw this on PBS the other night. Recorded it and have watched it several times. These guys are mesmerizing! There is such diversity in each of them. Can't decide which is my favorite. Have already preordered the CD and DVD and plan to purchase tickets for their live show in Atlanta in November as soon as they go on sale.
2,disappointed,"The music, production, singing, all was wonderful. The reason I'm disappointed is because the singers mostly sing solos. Out of 28 songs, four had all of them singing in harmony. This is supposed to be a group. There should be group singing."
5,Wonderful!,I first heard this group (reluctantly) on PBS when my husband requested I watch. I couldn't stop watching! I love this CD and can't wait to see and hear them in person. I also bought the CD so I can listen to them in my car!
5,Celtic Thunder,This is a superb production and I would highly recommend it. There is a great wealth of talent among the singers and musicians and the visual effects are superb
5,Celtic Thunder,Great singers. All have a distingtive style. Especially like Diaman. He has a very good voice for a young man.
4,This was fantastic,I really enjoyed this DVD. I was amazed at the talent and hope to go to the next show they have in my area. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Celtic and current songs.
5,TOTALLY AMAZING!!! Don't Miss This One!,"For anyone who loves good music, this group can NOT be missed! These guys are the most awesome thing to come along in many, many years! We stumbled across the show on PBS totally by accident, and immediately ordered both the CD and the DVD, and have almost worn it out since it arrived. This group will take the world by storm, as the THUNDER ROLLS!Absolutely TOP DRAWER, but with Phil Coulter involved, how could it miss!THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for enriching my life! I will be watching for anything and everything to come!"
4,Great show!,"I saw this show on PBS and really enjoyed it! I especially love the baritone ... sorry, I missed his name. He's really great on the songs about home and family (My Boy, The Old Man). I'll be pre-ordering the DVD for sure!"
5,AWESOME,"These 5 men are probably the best that I have ever heard. My 8 year old son even loves them. I watch them all the time. I love Damien, what a voice for such a young person."
3,"good show, poor quality","Although I was very happy with the show itself. We are enjoying this group very much. However, we are having a tough time playing the DVD. It didnt work on our regular dvd player or on our new laptop. I am able to play it on my inexpensive portable DVD player then link to the TV. But it took us hours to figure out.(Certainly wouldnt expect to have to do this.)I am contemplating returning this. So it's not the show or songs, just the production of the DVD's."
1,Sappy and derivative,"I will say up-front that I am a lover of Irish music as expressed in the A Woman's Heart series, for instance. I found in the music of this Celtic Thunder not only not really Celtic, but derivative and commercial to the nth degree, though I agree, everyone has a very nice voice. I was duly warned by a negative review on this site, but bought it anyway and left it at the local Free-cycle spot immediately. I rated the CD one star for lack of an alternative. There was another group also called Celtic Thunder in the 1980's, and their CD ""The Light Of Other Days"" is just wonderful and just the ticket for a dour purist like myself."
5,SO DOWN TO EARTH,"One of the things I noticed about the show (San Diego) is the waythe singers sing their song - then turn and walk away off the stage -they do not bow, they do not bask in glory, they do not try and steal the limelight - just a gorgeous peformance, they turn and walk away.I LOVED THAT!!! so classy."
4,Almost as good as Celtic Woman,Good show and great voices. Only weak point is that they use to much famous songs with no roots in Ireland.
5,Such A Treat,"I have watched this so many times I have lost count.Passed it on to my Daughter, and they have watched it so many times.Just takes you to a calm place, which we don't have time for much anymoreAfter watching this I ordered the dvd, and listen to it while doing my chores.You will be so glad to get this tape."
5,Awesome!,"I am so happy with my purchase! It was in great condition and had everything it said it would, plus it arrived way earlier than I had expected it. Completely satisfied with the purchase."
5,Outstanding book,"This book stands as one of the best works on the surrounding issues of the war. If one wants to be knowledgeable about the various swirling winds of controversial issues, they should read this book cover to cover. From the veterans own words, to the historical aspects, to the opinions, this book is designed to show why this war still resonates in our culture, and will for some time to come.A must read."
1,Yukky,"There is truly nothing good about this bunch of noise. I read a review about this group, allegedly you can put this in your car player and just drive happily all over Texas, while being entertained This might be true, if you were, for sure listening to someone else !!!!!!"
5,I LOVE EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY,"one of my fav. albums not sure how to rate an MP3 but, yeah if your just looking into explosions in the sky get this and the earth is not a cold dead place both are awesome. they have out a few more all are amazing ( look them up its worth it) but this was one of the first albums i heard of them and i fell in love."
1,weak,as a big EITS fan i find this album super simple and boring. not at all dynamic. keep to material that was meant to be released.
3,it was okay,I liked all the songs but I think they could've picked a lot better ones. I did really like the one by Supergrass.
4,pimping mix perfect for crusing for chicks,"I was pleased when my friend popped this cd into the car stereo. The first song I thought was one of the best of the whole CD the ""goddam right it's a beautfiul day"" song. Other good song is the one by Kid Rock. It is such a pimp song talking about his hoes. The Supergrass tune is also decent. The only problem I had with this CD is that I thought that there wasn't alot of bass in any of the songs."
3,Road trip,"This ST is really hit and miss. The stand out track of the album is ""Anything Anything"".BUCKCHERRY WRECKED THE SONG THOUGH!! IF YOU LIKE THIS SONG AND AINT HEARED THE ORIGINAL VERSION BY DRAMARAMA, BUY IT NOW!"
3,i think there's been a mix up,"the first song on this album is by a group known as Eels. now, the song that corresponds with the group is called ""Mr. E's Beautiful Blues"". BUT on the Eels album, Daisies of the Galaxy, there is a song that goes by the same name, ""Mr. E's Beautiful Blues"", and yet the two songs are completely different. did somebody screw up and just pick a random title from the eels archives and hope nobody noticed or what? am i missing something here? if anyone has a clue, help me out."
5,PERFECT,"tHIS TOOL SET works great with GUNDAM and anyother model kit you may own,and I'm glad that I bought it!"
5,happy,got this for my other half and he has already used it to put together a model i got him. very happy with this.
3,Great story with zero effort in presentation,"It's a beautiful story, but the bland presentation with no illustrations (except on the cover) leaves a lot to be desired. As I read each page I can imagine each scene and while I think that the use of imagination while reading is paramount, some illustrations would have been nice to widens it's appeal when presented to a variety of readers in a classroom setting. The story is 5 star and the presentation is 1 star. It's an unfinished children's book."
1,Worst children's book ever!,"This book should be banned. It promotes specieism, the most subtle kind of prejudice. It also promotes bullying. This kind of thinking leads to our allowing pollution of the earth, the air, and the water. Trash."
2,The half-empty glass....,"I wanted to like this CD. After all, the namesake episode was easily one of the best episodes of Xena that combined popular music and elements of the Xena-verse. My hope was for a CD along the lines of the Bitter Suite CD - a basic copy of the TV soundtrack.This CD isn't that. The musical tracks don't track the TV episodes. Many are not even in the sequence of the show. Instead, most tracks are studio mixes without some of the background elements like the voices. Several of the tracks don't even come from the final broadcast version of Lyre Lyre. A collection of LL and RO singing and music from the series is fine. But then, don't call it the soundtrack from Lyre Lyre. Instead, come out with another CD that does what the Bitter Suite CD did for the named episode!sign me, disappointed."
3,Not as Good as the Other Xena Soundtracks,"This CD is a must for Xena fans, but not as enjoyable as the other Xena soundtracks. Joseph Lo Duca is an excellent composer and the show would not have been nearly as good without his muscial genius to create mood in every single episode. The Lyre Lyre musical just isn't as good as a Lo Duca original musical would have been. Lyre Lyre is fun, especially ""Sisters are Doin' It for Themselves"" featuring the lovely voice of Lucy Lawless. ""Dancin' in the Moonlight"" is refreshing. ""We Can Work it Out"" didn't make it to the television episode, and it's a crying shame. It's quite possibly the best track on the CD, once again featuring Lucy's voice. If you're a Xena fan or a Lucy Lawless fan, definitely buy this one, but not before you buy the other Xena soundtracks."
2,Just terrible!,I went ahead a got this even though I REALLY disliked the episode and wished I had not wasted my money the LoDuca tracks are just not at all good enough to make this CD worth the money..sigh. Unless you actually liked the Lyre Lyre episode I'd stay away from this CD..
3,"Very Good, but not as good as the first 4 volumes","The first three songs were fun and I loved Lucy's rendition of the Beatles' ""We Can Work It Out."" However, the middle stuff was not to my liking and was a discredit to Joseph LoDuca's real talent.The last 5 songs are in tradition with the first 4 volumes and were great. Especially ""Tara's Dance,"" and ""Grieving Dance."" However, I would have prefered a CD with many of the songs and music we're still missing from episodes such as Destiny (M'lila's song) and Ides of March.We can only hope!"
2,Non-Xena Songs,"My rating is based on preference. I like my Xena: Warrior Princess songs to come from the Xena: Warrior Princess television show. Instead there's a multitude of non-xena-related songs on the CD but, (in their defense,) at least it was Gabrielle and Xena singing the songs.I guess I like traditional Xena-related songs to be on the CD, which is why my favorite Xena CDs are:Xena: Warrior Princess - Original Television Soundtrack & Xena: Warrior Princess - The Bitter Suite: A Musical Odyssey. Both are INCREDIBLE and MOVING!As for this particular CD, I'd rate it 2/5 stars due to songs picked, genre of songs picked, etc.Other than that... Go Xena!Xena: Warrior Princess - Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire: Original Television Soundtrack"
4,Perform Better exercise bands,One the cheapest way to make a workout interesting and different. These bands reinvent old movements keeping your workout fresh and exciting. These are one of the best cheap investments I've ever made as far as fitness gear is concerned.
4,Durable,"These bands are durable...however I coach a basketball team and the players often complain of the fear they will break during workouts. None have broken yet, however if you are doing a high intense workouts as I am using them for I recommend resistance bands with ankle traps. So far, none has broken yet!!!"
1,Not as described in the ad.,The ad for this particular item was not even close to as it was described. It appears like you would be getting a total of 4 bands. You only get one.
1,junk,"Three of these broke. Granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed, but to no avail. My wife received something similar from SPRI (doctor's tubing) and it has lasted for a few years now."
1,'Good' Would Be A Real Stretch,"I ordered one of these exercise mini bands to put around my knees while doing thigh exercises. I'm 5'8"" and 130 lbs, and I could hardly manage to get the yellow light resistance band around both of my legs. Once I did get the thing around my legs, the flat part rolled up and threatened to cut off my circulation. I've used resistance bands in the past that I needed to tie off myself, and I thought those were awful... but now I'm reconsidering my opinion. These mini bands are the worst!And on top of all that, it's pointless for me to return this item. I already paid triple in shipping what this dumb thing was worth, and I'm certainly not about to pay for return shipping just to ship this ridiculous piece of elastic back for resale.If you're looking for resistance bands to use with leg-work, especially to put around your thighs, DO NOT BUY THESE. They are flat out awful. I'll never buy from Perform Better again."
1,dissappointing,"bought these after seeing a tv show on a set of exercises to do with them. They are a very thin band about 1.5"" wideWhat I absolutely hate about them is their strong tendency to roll up--which then are very uncomfortable to use--require constant readjustment.I have a band that is less wide but thicker that is much better in the regard- will look for that type next time"
5,Wish I had ordered the black!,"I purchased yellow, green and blue bands for a weight training class I instruct. The yellow and green bands were much to easy for my students. They would be great for seniors or for people rehabbing. I have my group wear a few of them to create more tension. I wish I had purchased only the blue and black.We really enjoy the bands during class. They're a nice break from weights. The bands are also very soft and don't irritate the skin."
2,Bamboozled at the end,"Product itself was fine. Problem I had was that when I went to order a second batch a month or so later, after I entered all the information including credit card, they then post a warning on the final page that these items contain carcinogens. I don't remember the exact wording but it was toxic enough to make me cancel my order and be very annoyed that they weren't transparent with this information at the initial view of the product. Waiting to state that at order's end lacked integrity and honesty. I certainly don't remember seeing that wording when I made my initial order or I would have cancelled that as well.I will not be buying any more from this supplier until they get the toxic materials out of their product and make that known."
1,Don't Buy this Band!!!!,"My band (the blue superband) snapped on the third use, doing some pretty easy stretching. A complete waste of money."
4,Heroes of the Holocaust,This book tells the story of the true tales of treachery and brutality that so many victims experienced at the hands of the Nazis. The horrors that happened to the Jews could almost convince one that evil can win out over good in the the souls of human beings. This book gives us a closer look at the tragedies that happened and at the heorism and bravery carried out by others. This is the story of the underground groups who stage rescues. Readers age 12 and up will read with interest of the citizens who risked thier lives to save other human beings from the hatred and genocide that swept Europe during World War II. This is the story of that liitle spark of goodness in our human nature that offers us a little hope that such horrors will never happen again.
5,Works!,"Amazing product, just the right size. The full size tube I'll use once and they just dry out, this is perfect, I always have some left when it's needed."
5,Very comvenient kit,"For this type of glue is the best applicators you can purchase, as you know this glues once opened they become dry in very short time, so the small size of the tubes with applicator are perfect for several fixes of things to glue. You can yet stick a tack in the small opening and it will last a couple of extra days if you did not use it all."
1,did not do what it said it would,This product promised to glue together metal. I tried using this super glue to glue my watch together again and it just broke again.
1,Do not buy this product,"The only thing this glue sticks on is your fingers. I try to glue a wood elephant, a really mess! Do not buy this product ever."
2,Krazy Glue KG58248SN Instant Crazy Glue 4-Single Use Tubes of 0.017-Ounce,"Not practical, buy the reusable one instead, I mean the the bigger tube that the pin that you reseal with for future use.These are a waste because once use a tube you got to throw it away the remainder becauseit is not resealable..Crazy glue is a very strong glue so oftentimes you just need a little dab here and there to completely glue an item.I would never buy this again. Crazy glue has made their name as one of the best. But this particular little pack of tubes to me is not a good idea."
5,Great packaging,Arrived quickly and the small packaging is great. I recommend this over the other packaging that can dry out quickly.
2,Rough is right!,"While reading this book didn't make my knees buckle or cause me to become light-headed, there were some pretty careless mistakes. The writing is pretty terrible, and it has the annoying tone of a gossip column. The whole book is laid out in a bullet(ish) People magazine style.It has no value as a reference book, since you can't trust any information in it as being true. I thought I was learning some interesting stuff until the moment I hit my third stupid error; so now everything in it is suspect. I think a lot of the trouble can be attributed to careless writing and not checking one's sources.On the plus side (and even though the interior art and layout is pretty lame), I found the size, shape, and stupid Spiderman cover strangely alluring. Its just a neat size; maybe somebody could write a factual reference book in this format."
3,EarJams 2 Will not with the NEW iPhone,"These will not clip on to my iPhone they are just a little bit too large and they fall off. I had to put a little glue on it so hey stay on. I was going to return them however, I decided not because of the shipping cost.They will fit on the earbuds that are furnished with the IPOD"
3,Ear Jams - Eh.,"I got this hoping it would stop my ear buds from falling out of my ears while I was running. It did not really help with this. It does change the sound, but increasing the bass and decreasing the treble. Overall not really that useful."
1,total [..],To say these are total [...] would be an understatement. They are slightly to big therefore will not fit on my standard ipod earbuds.
1,Not so Jamming Ear Jams,This is product is a great idea for those of us who can not wear ear buds. However they are designed for the old ear buds models which are bigger. The newer ear buds are smaller in size and fall right out of the ear jams. Greatly disappointed!
1,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies!,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.
1,This formula is terrible!,"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work."
1,Horrible!,"This product was given to me as a gift. When I went to use it half the markers didn't work. A week later when I went to use it again, No paint came out. Rip-OFF! The company has no website or contact info and the product was discontinued(I wonder why), so I am stuck with it."
3,Thought-provoking,"Though I was only a kid at the time, I still remember John Paul I and what a shock his death after so short a reign caused. How could that smile be allowed to disappear so soon? John Cornwell's book was written largely in response to David Yallop's speculative, but well put together thesis ""In God's Name"" which argued that John Paul I was murdered.John Cornwell's verdict is equally damning. He gives us some fresh insights into the medical evidence and talks to some interesting people. In the end, though, I wasn't convinced. There is still far too much room for doubt."
5,Great choice for Outdoor Speaker,"Installed these speakers for an outdoor patio setup, and they sound terrific for their size. Surprisingly good bass response with ample treble for a nice, balanced sound. The bracket system is easy to install. The speaker wire can be connected either by using a banana plug or directly connecting the wire to the terminal posts. The jury is still out on how they will handle the AZ heat. Very happy so far."
4,THE New York Skyscraper,"This is a wonderful book with amazing vintage black and white period photos. The book mostly focuses on the building of the skyscraper in the 30's and my only qualm with the book is the lack of current photos of the building, but that is a minor critisism and should not reflect on the overall excellent quality of the book. The Chrysler Building is a pinnacle of Art Deco style and I love it. The history of the building is so interesting and story of the spire is such a quenticential New York moment. I recomend this book to anyone who loves the romance of the skyscraper and this one is magical."
2,Nice PHOTOGRAPHS,"This is a beautiful book of photographs. However, I was quite diappointed in the fact that there is very little text in this book. The history of the building of the Chrysler Building is fascinating, yet explanations and descriptions are non-existent in this book. One would have to buy another book to learn of all the facts, the building process, the ""competition"" with the Empire State Building, or the architect, who was never truly recognized and compensated for this magnificent work of art. It is a nice book to add to a collection, but I would seek out a more comprehensive book to get a true and complete picture of the masterpiece of the Chrysler Building."
5,"Unique, One of a Kind Book","Byron Farwell is an author well know to those of us with interests in Victorian armies, wars and leaders. Most of his books are narrative histories, well written and enjoyable. Surprisingly, this single volume encyclopedia is just as interesting (as encyclopedias go, that is) in it's own way. Open up the book to any random page, pick an entry and start reading. Soon you'll be jumping to entries referenced by the first, and soon an hour is gone as you read up on some obscure battle in some obscure war and now you'll just have to learn more about it! Very much recommended to anyone with an interest in the period."
3,Track Title Correction,"Track 9 on this album is not ""Let End in His Own Boots"" but instead ""A Leg End in His Own Boots"" - inventitive titling at its best."
3,Like a wall of guitars strumming...,"This 1992 release was their 2nd of three releases. A unique aspect about Ned is that they feature two bassists. Rather than the traditional rhythm and lead guitar, their sound is more like a wall of guitars strumming, sort of a cross between Big Country and The Alarm and sometimes U2. Very dated."
5,Many cute projects,"I purchased this book for my lower school students. There are many fun, easy projects that the students have enjoyed."
3,Norman,"The player had all the requirements I wanted in an MP3 player, however the features that I was most interested in did not work or did not work properly, Could not make the unit recognize MS outlook even after contacting creative support for help, The book mark for use with Audio books did not stop the player at the spot where I left off and when turning it back on again could not find the spot I previously stopped at. I loved the size, the screen the way it handled,However after trying TWO of the Creative Zen players and neither one worked for me properly I returned them both and baught an Apple iPod Mini."
1,Avoid the freeze up,"This product replaces a 5 gig Creative Micro which had a hard drive and broke at 1 year after a minor drop. The Zen V is easier to download. The 2 gig space allows me to hold up to 5 audiobooks and some music. The battery is lasting about 10 hours. Sound quality is better than the Micro I appreciate former comments about the unit will not lose its place if the unit is shut down while playing rather than hitting the pause/stop button, which will start at the beginning of the book or song.I had a few encounters with the unit freezing up. I can control the frequency of freezes by allowing the unit to ""think"" after I touched a button or control. It's a little slow to respond to the commands. If I'm pressing a button more than once or hitting the back button command to get into the system controls, I wait until the unit gets to the window that I want before telling the unit what to do. No freezing!"
3,Zen V GB mp3 player,"I like the features that it has but the ear pieces fall out easily. I like that it has a strap that I can wear around my neck. The toggle style button is ok to use but hard for people with larger hands to manipulate. It has good sound, and I could use it to download mp3 s from other sites to download on the player."
4,Simple,"This item was easy to use, I like simplicity. Although the battery does not last as long as the box claimed!"
2,Good but...,"This product is good in a lot of ways. Small, lightweight, and joystick feature is easy to use. But it can be defective in a lot of ways too. In order to unfreeze the player, you have to find a small pin to fit in the tiny hole on the side. If you have no access to one at the time, it stays locked and then the battery could die completely. And I dont see an access point to even get to the battery. Sometimes the inside of the product with turn defective after a while. My boyfriend's Creative that I gotten him, the USB part couldn't find the USB cable connected to it, even though its been working fine for a month. My Creative product had a defect in the earphones after almost a year of using it. So I wouldnt recommend this product or many Creative products to my friends and family anymore."
5,Don't buy an IPOD,This is a nifty little unit with easy controls and superior sound quality. My daughter has friends with IPODs and Sansas and this blows them away.
2,"Warning, Device Contains Cancer Causing Agent",This is the exact warning description written on the 4th page of the use manual:Warning: The cord(s) included with this product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.WTF??! Why isn't this warning listed on their advertisement? I would not have bought it if I knew about it. Do not buy this product if it is a concern to you.But overall it is not a bad MP3 player.
3,i enjoyed the lp so i bought the cd which was hard to find,I have always been a red rider fan. I am the only one that I know of. I enjoy the lyrics. I prefer discs like As Far As Siam and really like the symphany session cd. But there are some good tracks on this disc. I feel the band kind of went a little to 80's on this disc when they were doing fine with the rock . I would really like to hear them do some harder rock. I know it would be real good.
4,review of kneeler,I am very happy with the kneeler. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that it woud be nice if it was about an inch higher in the kneeing position.
4,A Very Practical Mother's Day Present,"I gave this stool to my mother for Mother's Day. She still does a little gardening around her house and on her deck. It's great for kneeling on, if you put the seat side down, and also makes a nice stool for sitting. Functionally it works great. It loses one star because it's a little heavy and is quite stiff to fold and unfold, though the mechanism is very positive. My mother is planning on keeping it set up and not folding it closed.Basically I think it's a nice little product. I'm thinking of purchasing one for myself to use while lifting dumbbells. But I don't want to do anything hasty."
2,Not designed to last,"I just threw away one of these. My wife's the gardener. She liked the product, but the seat wore out, and a replacement was not available. Nope. You have to throw the whole thing out, and buy another. Let's just say my wife is disgusted."
5,Rumford Gardener JBI2000 Gardener's Kneeler / Seat,"I bought this for my wife who is an avid gardener and she thought it was the most wonderful kneeler she had ever seen. Sturdy, easy to use, comfortable padding and waterproof to boot. She also liked the green steel with the yellow pad, sunflower colors she said."
2,Did anyone mention how heavy this kneeler is?,This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well. Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store. It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft.
1,Safety Review,"I had a similar one that I bought 5 years ago. Almost the same.This chair as is, is safety hazard for older people, you can easily flip back.The chair is about 1.5 inches too high.To make it safer, I made a wooden channel that extend about 1.5 inches beyond the width of the legs. This prevents you from flipping in either direction. Had the wooden channel plate screwed to the bottom of the legs.You also had something very close to this item for less.If you want a digital picture o9f the modified chair, would more than happy to send it to you. As is, the chair is a SAFETY HAZARD for older people.Sincerely yours, LFZ"
2,Knee saver?,This item not as good as the previous model that I had. Quite difficult to open. Weak wrists will never get it unfolded. Seat is too hard for the knees.
4,Instructions would be the only improvement,Great product. The gift recipient was delighted. The only improvement would be to include instructions on how to fold the thing back together. I ended up going online for the info.
2,Ever hear of proofreading??,"Was this book printed in hurry? It is full of typos, plusthe books sucks!!!!!"
3,trimmer line,"Good price for the quantity, but I think the quality lacks a bit. It is 'quieter' as suggested, but doesn't last as long as the generic stuff I bought at Lowes. Even though it's the same gauge/thickness, it isn't as sturdy and needs to be fed more often. Still worth the money."
4,trimmer line,just got and i have took a good look at it. I feel it will work well. its not to stiff yet it feel strong. I have a small lawn maintenance business and know what im looking for. Its not grass cutting season yet but i have a good feeling about what i bought.
2,Sigh,"This plays like one of those films you had to watch in elementary school about brushing your teeth, or eating enough vegetables. I hoped for a really great documentary all about the oil sands, and this isn't it. It spends the first 15 minutes as a travel agent film about Alberta, and wastes most of the rest of its time sounding as if it is a promotional film for the big oil companies. There ARE some redeeming facts and figures, but the low production value and sim city sountrack, combined with the laconic narrator put you to sleep before you can absorb anything useful. Give it a miss."
2,OH .....the pain .,"If this movie came out in th 70's it would have been ok, but this is 2007and this type of movie has been made over and over again but what takesthe cake is the giant rubber Rat costume..... i had to foward it to the end toend this movie."
1,Thumbs down,This is the book we used in my first undergraduate course in topology. I remember it as being one of the worst textbooks I ever came across in my undergraduate math studies. The explanations were too short and many definitions were buried into the text. I remember constantly having to flip through the pages of this book to find something I was looking for. Stay away from this book!
3,Munkres is better,"As other reviewers said, the book is useless as a reference because it introduces definitions in the paragraph with no bold typeface or offsetting. It makes a good effort at developing an 'intuition' for topology, but I don't think this is strong enough to overcome the weak organization."
2,Your Average topology student will be frustrated...,"This text is very very difficult to read for people like me, your average topology student. A difficult subject to grasp, the layout of this book simply does not help organize the material. I have purchased several other books, that while they don't make topology easy, at least make it digestable. Pass on this book and go with Munkres."
1,"Bad, Bad Book","This book is terrible. The author doesn't denote important material at all! Sometimes the most important part of a section is contained in one poorly written sentence. This book is subpar. Both Munkres and Hatcher provide everything this book does, in fact much more so, and presents the material in much more rigor. I haven't seen a worse introductory book on the subject, though for some reason people who already know the material seem fond of the book.I'd give it -5 stars if I could."
1,"Run. Munkres, Massey are better","this text is required for my course on introductory topology. Not only does it omit entire branches of the subject, for example only giving cursory treatments of vector field topology, metric topolgy, and combinatorial techniques; but, the presentation is mostly unexplained. The author has concentrated on following a very dry quick example-theorem-proof technique instead of theorem-proof interspersed with discussion and example technique. I have yet to find a superb text, though for algebraic things i like massey"
2,NO NO,"The fact that the author does not explicitly define things is a bad enough reason to stay away from this book. If you only want a light treatment of point-set topology, go for Munkres, otherwise, Hatcher."
4,"Take it from me, I know Quang in real life!!!","Yah that right, I happen to know Quang he know lives near Bennington Vt, and a lot of my family buys his homemade medicine. I heard he had a book he wrote so I thought it would be nice to read it. I have started to read the book, and it is very well written, you won't find this book in stores."
2,was this book written or taped?,"Actually, 2 1/2 stars. Great content, especially if you're interested in oriental medicine. However, 3/4ths of the book felt as if Ms Pivar had just turned on a tape recorder and then turned it off at the end of a recording session, and had then written verbatum what the tape recorder had picked up (perhaps she did). That was SO FRUSTRATING!!! However, I can certainly understad Ms Pivar's deep respect for this most interesting & humble man and for his father as well. And I would highly recommend venturing to Vermont to see this man for your health care."
5,Why not on DVD???,"I wish this were on DVD. I don't understand why its not? This was one of mine and my mom's favorites. We recorded it on a VHS and watched it over and over again...loved this movie. For years I've been checking regularly to see if its available on DVD and hoping it soon will be, so I can share with my daughters."
2,HARDCORE YELLOWMAN FANS ONLY,"This man here was the d.j. everybody wants to be but cant. he gets no respect now in reggae, but in the early 1980's he rapped over the hottest dancehall beats on the island. 15 years later Enough money was put together to throw a new album from yellowman, there is a couple of good ones here but for the most part skip this. unless you are a yellowman fanatic. i would recommend getting yellowman anthology look how me sexy. that is a highlight of his best stuff."
4,"neutral meaning of ""feudal""","Hoyt tackles the very definition of ""feudal"". In common parlance, it is often implying a negative connotation. To call something feudal is rarely a compliment. This book takes a more dispassionate approach. Explaining that to a professional historian, feudal tends to a more precise, and often value-neutral meaning.Thus, Hoyt starts with the base meaning of ""vassal"". Another word that today rarely has positive ambiance. He explains how it mean subordination or personal dependence. Indeed, to understand vassal and how it was used recursively, if you will, is to see the dialectic underpinnings of European feudalism. Predominantly, the book looks at Carolingian France, which was in the early Middle Ages. For it was the society of this France that directly had 2 descendents. The French nation state of the later Middle Ages. And England after the Norman invasion."
2,Not as useful as I'd hoped,"I recently returned from a two-week trip to Naples and Sorrento, Italy and was disappointed to find that a number of common Italian menu items were not listed. Examples were AUBERRGINES (eggplant), ""ROCKET"" SALAD , PARMA HAM, (just to mention a few). Based on my review of several different Italian menus, this book was of little practical use."
2,Yudo: Half the Story.,"In the Republic of Korea, Yudo is both a sport and a military art. This video limits itself to the Olympic sport of Judo, which bears slight resemblance to the military art. The failure to provide a proper history of the oriental art of Judo in Korea is deeply disappointing, especially since Korea is the only country in the world wherein the martial art created by Kano Jigoro is still taught as Kano intended it to be taught, as a military art. If one wants a videotape which illustrates the Korean adaptation and practice of the Olympic sport of judo, they may want to purchase this videocassette. It is a unique production in that regard and belongs in the collection of every sport judo competitior. If one wants to gain an understanding of the traditional military art of Yudo, as practiced in Korea for nearly a century, this videocassette is a total waste of money."
2,Limited Scope,"This book will serve as a good reference if you are interested in packaging design for food/beverage products, but it has very limited examples outside this vertical market. I'd prefer to see a wider scope."
4,4.0 Jeep 0.044. NOT FEL-PRO.,"This is not a felpro gasket. It came in felpro wrapping, but its a Victor Reinz 54249s. They're pretty much interchangeable so no biggie. Both are 0.044/0.043"" compressed."
2,A let down from a great author,"I am a Terry Brooks fan and I love the Shannara books, but The Elf Queen fell far short of my expectations. Wren's character isn't develope enough and I don't really like her anyway. The one misgiving of all the heroes in the Shannara books is that they are afraid to use the magic. Why not just use it?! Gavilan and the Owl were the best characters of this book, along with Cort. I don't like how Mr. Brooks always kills off the minor characters. They are the coolest ones. I wish Par would die...Maybe Mr. Brooks will do a follow up of Talismans and kill off Wren and Par. Walker Boh is the only cool main character. The Elf Queen is the worst in the series besides The Sword of Shannara."
2,Continuing drab storyline,"While Brooks has improved the story flow and character development over the course of the original series of three books and the heritage series, he still gets bogged down in characters inner thoughts and just doesn't seem to have to talent to pull it off. I don't understand how a girl can face all the ""evils"" she does, becoming disgusted by them and terrified of them, but put an unbelievable amount of trust in a splinterscat she knows nothing about. Be as worldly as she is supposed to be and capable of leading a race of elves, but not have been outside one section of the continent she was born on, and have lead no one anywhere. How she can fall in love with a minor character she only knew for a few days and she hardly talked to. These don't seem to be stumbling blocks for Brooks, but God help his characters try to use the magic that is supposed to save the world as their destiny guides."
5,Excellent series.,"This book is the culmination of an excellent series. I encourage you to buy all three novels. They are up to Terry Brooks usual standard, or way above most authors. I noticed some reviews felt that the book wound everything up too quickly, but I feel that was mostly their desire to keep on reading the story. It is that good. I did not feel shorted by the last novel, although I could have kept reading! I actually prefer three book series. More than that and I tend to lose interest. I liked the series and await Mr. brooks next literary artwork."
2,not as good as the other shannara books,Elf Queen was somewhat boring to read. i didn't have the interest to read it like i did with all the other shannara books. Elf Queen wasn't very well written. What made it boring was that there isn't really any suspense or big battle scenes. The book is like reading a mario game. It's just going around to different places figuring out how to get to the lost elf kingdom.
2,A Somewhat Dull Book,"For those of you who have a great passion for books filled with action and adventure, and those of you who have a fairly short attention span, I would not suggest this book. It doesn't have much action, and one can lose interest very easily unless really resigned in the task of finishing the gosh darn thing."
1,They keep sending the stinking Tyranus Ep 3 instead of what they list here,"Target bait and switched me twice now! You WILL NOT recieve the one pictured above!Don't do it! You will not like what you recieve, unless you like the Ep3 Tyranus version. I am ATTEMPTING to get the correct item shipped, but cannot return online (shows as non-returnable, people) and cannot get a real person from target to even check stock for me to see if I want returns or exchanges."
5,Does the job it was made for,"Bought two of these for my outdoor washing line and they are great, they do exactly what they are made to do. There is only one flaw with this item and that is when you release the pole back to its compact state, the inner pole pushes the ground stablizer out of the bottom of the outer pole, but this pole will still function if you loose the stablizer, so not really a problem."
5,Great clothesprops,"These clothes props work great. I always had a problem when the wind blew, the prop would fall down and the clothes dragged on the ground. These props have a little nub on the bottom that kinda seats itself into the ground. I would definately recommend them."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I got the exact same item from Ace Hardware. They would not stay up. Clothes wound up on the ground. I'm very disappointed.
3,A very useful guide to applications,"I find the book very clearly written, very pedagogical and an excellent reference. It is particularly useful for student and for researchers who are getting started in the field. It contains plenty of advanced material as well"
2,Cheap and tacky!,I got this as a gag gift and even then it fell short of any expectation. Very flimsy and a good portion of the memory was taken up by nonsense that Burton put on the USB that took some time to get rid of.
1,broken like within two month,"i bought this item like two years agothen after one month...doesn't work anymore,.....it was a gift for my BF...cuz it looks cool...he likes to snowboarding...will never buy this anymore"
4,Sewing for kids,"These were perfect for teaching my granddaughter how to cross stitch. No counting little square, clearly stamped with nice large x's"
1,Don't buy this book!,"This book consists of basically listings of every McDonald's in Florida. It is basically pulled from the phone book and not one bit informative. I expected a listing with descriptions of some cute out of the way places, well certainly not in this book!"
2,Not Enough Information,I was very disappointed with this book. I could have gotten the same information out of the phone book.
5,"Add Fire and Romance to your life,listen to Espanoletta",I love this CD by Chatham Baroque. Espanoletta is a great combination of lively dances and soulful pieces that invoke memories of romance and far away places. I'ts music to sooth your soul and ease your mind after a long day. Go right out and buy this record. Also check out Sol Y Sombra and Dance Royale also by Chatham Baroque
5,perfect for my wedding,"I plan to use this album as the background music for the reception at my November wedding. It lends itself to that time of year I think. My favorite piece is the Carabanda, it just evokes a bountiful, festive harvest-y feel that will be perfect for my fall wedding. Plus I am a lover of Baroque music, and this is elegant and sophisticated without being stuffy or heavy. Just perfect!"
1,help!!,"I still haven't received my dress from bitablue. I sent it back for another size, they responded via email that they had received it, but still no dress. So far this has been a very poor transaction."
3,Future Star,"Jeremy Kay is a musician to watch. He's got a punchy hook-laden sound that has definite commercial appeal. ""Have It All"" is my favorite on this CD with strong electric guitar, good melody and lyric. ""Today I feel like laughin', Seems to be no reason at all, And if the world stops spinning, I'm not afraid to fall."" What confidence! ""Greatest Mind"" has a cool cosmic rocker riff. ""No barrier between the greatest mind and mine, The universe is open all the time."" The songwriting is consistenly strong. On a small label, this one will probably unfortunately head to the bargain bins for lack of airplay. Seek, listen and take it home!"
4,Eagerly awaiting his next....,"I heard a track from this album on a surfing show that was on late nite cable tv. I turned the VCR on to record the credits for the show to get the name of the artist, then bought the album the next day. To me, it's a fun musical ride. Music and volcals that feel good to hear. I look forward to his next album."
5,Wow!,"I just got this cd today and I am wowed! I'd heard ""Have it all"" on the television show ""Young Americans"" and I just fell in love with his voice. He has some fabulous songs on this album and I would recommend him to anyone. I can't pinpoint any one catagory of music I would put Jeremy Kay in, he's got so many different and wonderful sounds on his album. It's just one of those cd's where all the songs are great. All my praise to Jeremy and my hope that everyone will buy this awesome cd!"
1,dum de dum dum...,"sorry-by page 24, and the second time the heroine has said ""Jumping Jehoshaphat""(cause she's a Texan, right?),she is an experienced rider but doesn't realize that smacking the camel with the whip is going to make it GALLOP, and her business partners first name is, get this, Welcome-!!!??!!-I tossed this juvenile book into the recycling bin where it belongs. I've seen bad series romance better written than this. Don't waste your time-0 stars:("
4,Love through time,"Meri Vaughn has been having some problems since she arrived in Egypt. It all started when she bought a golden falcon pendant in a street bazaar, little does she know that it's a priceless treasure that some people are willing to kill to get.

3,You need a lot of patience to finish this.....,"I love David Souchet...but this is undoubtedly the most slow, dragging, boring thing he has ever done. I still haven't finished watching it...it's like waiting for fudge to set.....come on...do something....... bogs down...wish I had my money back ."
5,Check this OUT ! ! ! ! ! ! !.,"Man I just got this album last weekend and it's been in my stereo ever since, the way this Artist Remix this tracks is extremly cool I have other tributes to Mexican Artist and I want to say this one is one of the best here are my favorites: Mi Matamoros Querido by Plastilina Mosh 5 Stars, Lamento de Amor by Panteon Rococo 5 Stars, Mi Amiga, Mi Esposa, Mi Amante by Los Amigos Invisible 5 Stars, !Ho!

5,Before I Formed You In the Womb I Knew You,"Karen Garver Santorum knew her child Gabriel, who was formed in her womb, before he was born for others to see. An experiential, very moving description of the tenacious way which the author loved her chilld before he was born. Though I lack the capacity to bear a child (i.e., maleness), the vicarious experience through Ms. Santorum was stunning. Whatever one might feel about the rights of an unborn child, what is undeniable is the real and true human relationship between the author and her son. A thrilling and moving experience to read!"
5,Tears will come,My wife and I have also lost a baby. We know the heartbreak. This little book will make you cry. It will also make you proud to live on the same planet with people like the Santorum family.
4,Just as described,Very touching letters from the wife of Rick Santorum. Came in great condition and on time. Reveals a lot about the author and her husband and their deeply held faith!
1,A bad father and mother,"They had many living children, children who needed them. Instead they allowed her life to be risked bringing to term a non-viable child. She took a terrible risk with her life, and the welfare of her children.Then, she compounded the terrible fright she gave her children into emotional trauma by bringing a dead baby home for them to meet!I am almost entirely pro-life. I believe abortion is almost always wrong. In a case like hers, though, she made a selfish choice. To ease her conscience, she put her children at risk, for no real benefit to the baby. He had twenty weeks of life.It would be one thing if she didn't have any children. But a family needs a mother and a father. And it's a husband's job to look out for his wife's safety above all other things. Her husband was negligent, and I have no respect for him now."
5,AFTER FOREST CAME THIS!!!,"This is very underrated/unknown!!!FOREST..was to me the best album ever made in MUSIC history!!! then to follow it up CATHEDRAL made this ep!!Now on here Cathedral throw in some grove and really get ya near dancing!! THIS IS STILL HEAVY AS FUKK!!! just not as heavy as the first album...but then what is??This is FUKKING MANDATORY!!!!!Your recipe for DOOM..first CATHEDRAL ep, FOREST..,this EP!!!!!! I dig this stuff till no END!!!''FROZEN RAPTURE'' could be right off the first album..so you know what yer getting into here!!"
3,Jose Why did you leave?,"I was intrigued by the artists compiled for vol.7. Unfortunately, this compilation sounds like many other downtemp or chill-out compilations. Padilla's touch is definitely not on here and I think a disappointment to his fans. On that note, it a fairly decent Cd for the beach and background dinner party music. Definitely check out vol 3 and vol 5."
2,only two songs really,"Atmospheric--yes. But it's not a CD to write home about. There are really only two standout tracks--Bedrock's ""Beautiful Strange"" and Bush's ""Letting the Cables Sleep.""I expected more as I heard great stuff about this whole Cafe Del Mar series. Nice to have one CD but that's where I'll stop.Basically, background music at best."
2,Not anywhere near as relaxing as advertised,"This is not for anyone searching for an ambient, downtempo bit of chill-out music, unless your idea of chill-out is frantic bar-hopping. The tracks aren't bad tracks, just not very chilled, and not the best compilation floating around. A club record despite its ""relaxing"" reputation. Make no mistake: its a contemporary dance and martini record."
3,Not the best Cafe Del Mar,"While this is a very solid Chill CD, it doesn't really measure up to the rest of the Cafe Del Mar series. There are definitely highlights - ""68 Moves"" by Underwolves is outstanding, and the remix of ""Letting the Cables Sleep"" is terrific. The rest of the tracks are unremarkable, and none have that lounge feel that the Cafe Del Mar famously mixes in. It's still very, very good chill, but just a little weak by Cafe Del Mar's high standards."
2,If you are not expecting much,"I mistakenly read only the first couple of reviews for this record and made my decsion based on that praise. I was looking for a chill out album on the same par as the ""served chilled"" series by Hed Kandi. What I got instead was a mixture of eletronica chillout, followed up by some lackluster mellow tunes. If you like the sound of ""AIR"", and not their good tracks mind you, then this might be for you. If you crave the ""siren songs"" of Nitan Sawhney, Jhelisa, D*Note, Korova...where both the music and lyrics are true beauty beyond description, then check out the served chilled collection. It costs more but at least you dont get left holding the barf bag. Cafe del Mar 7 is the perfect background music for reading the morning paper, or some task where music is not to be focused on, or better yet, it probably sounds best coming through the speakers of the new-age, crystal and insence emporium shop, but not an ""after hours"" I'd want to be at."
5,Simply beautiful,"Why anybody would give this album less than five stars is a mystery to me. I'm a fan of the entire Cafe Del Mar series and this one is definitely the best. Moby's track is great. Even Bush has a great track on there, remixed by Nightmares on Wax, and I hate Bush with a passion. The album is truly dazzling. Each track is amazing. The album is downtempo enough to relax to but still lively enough to keep your neck rubbery. I can't say enough about this album. It's my favorite album of the year."
2,Too much hype,"This compilation is really ALRIGHT. I really don't understand all the hype around the music on this collection. Its decent mellow, mood music, but really no different from any other mediocre collection of ""chill out"" music."
1,Not what we were looking for....,I bought this for someone who just suffered a miscarriage. She read the book and told me that it was really aimed at someone who lost a child. She will probably pass it on to a mom who just lost her teenage girl...
2,Probably dictated it on a plane...,"This book is more about the ego of a workacholic than an ""insider"" view of the industry. Tartikoff rambles, and not fluidly. I find it interesting that there is not one well-written story in the book, and this is the guy who was responsibile for that very thing."
3,"ENTERTAINING, YET FLAWED, LOOK AT NBC IN THE 1980'S","""The Last Great Ride"" details the late Brandon Tartikoff's tenure at NBC during the 1980's in his own words. He does not present the information chronologically but rather topically (and there does not seem to be any particular reason to the order they are presented). Readers will enjoy reading about the creation of shows like ""The Cosby Show"", ""Hill Street Blues"", ""Highway to Heaven"" and many other NBC shows of that era. However be warned that not all of the successful shows of that era are covered (""Riptide"" fans will not find anything here of note about that show). And it should be noted that the book is weakened the author's use of profanity. But the book's basic rags to riches story (of a distant third place network turning around into the dominant first place network) will be enjoyable to any TV fan."
4,Update of a fascinating source book of Humanist Thinking,"I was fortunate to meet Margaret Knight in Aberdeen in the late 1960s where she kindly gave me a signed copy of her original anthology. The present publication includes writings by outhors from the ban-the-bomb era of the 60s when traditional moral and religious values began to be questioned (as exemplified by Margaret's BBC programmes ""Morals without Religion)up to the present day. Thus we have here a compendium of Humanist Thinking from ancient to contemporary times which may be used as a source book or read as a stimulating review of the development of Humanist ideas."
3,"Worked for 3 years, then dead","The title says it all--this drive worked flawlessly for 3 years until it failed. I am now contacting Seagate, since this item has a 5-year warranty, thankfully. I have a second drive just like this one, purchased at the same time, that is still working fine.________________Update June 2012: Both drives, replacement and the original, now having serious read/write problems. I guess some would say that lasting this long is par for the course. Hmmm...Make sure you get the 5 year warranty if you buy, buy also make sure this is not your only backup drive, as it may well fail."
1,A Sea of Trouble,"I hate writing this review because I like reviewing stuff only when I'm excited. This HD has been anything but. About 10 days after having installed this exact hard-drive I suddenly got the message ""A disk read error occurred"" as I tried to re-boot my computer. Luckily the HD is new and I had already made backups. A search in the Internet for this specific error and HD revealed a lot of similar reports from other people."
1,Head crashed...I may have lost ALL my photos of my son,"This was bought to be used as an external drive. The other day, after about 6 months, I heard the click of death. The drive doesnt work any longer and I hadn't backed up this drive. I may have lost over 2,000 photos, most of my son since he was born, a family home movie, and lots of music (no big deal). Bottom line...Back up and maybe don't buy a Seagate if you like your data."
4,Canoe Trip,"The book, Canoe Trip, by David Curren, is a book about one man's quest to brave the wilderness. This is an awesome book for those of you who love the outdoors. if you are one who has been on solo missions or even adventures with your friends and want to gain more info on survival, than pickup a copy of this book. Mr. Curren, who works in a public school, is the type of guy, nobdy would expect to travel to Maine and brave the whitewater rapids of a river.For those of you who dream of making a name for yourself, but don't quite know what to do, read an adventure book such as this and get inspired. Moose, cold, and an unforgiving river, could not stop this man Don't let skeptisizm stop you. If adventure and excitement are what you're into, read this book, reject fear as he did. It is an excellent piece. For those of you who have read it, you know what I mean."
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't think the quality of writing was good, and the story was not interesting. There are better reads out there"
2,Shallow on canoeing and adventure,"I have a bookshelf full of canoeing and outdoor adventure books as well as a sixteen year collection of the Boundary Waters Journal. This book does not rate a place in my collection. In fact, it might qualify as one of my worst buys - especially at the highly inflated price of $17.99. I found that the content did nothing to hold my attention and make me want to turn the page. Perhaps the depth of the author's experiences (or at least what he relates in this volume) can be discerned from his meal preparation - heating a can of Dinty Moore beef stew on a gas stove. That pretty well sums up his Maine Wilderness trip."
3,Good book for topic,Canoe Trip by Cavid Curran is a fantastic book about one mans adventures deep inside the woods of Maine. The story goes into detail explaining the rivers he took when he went canoeing in Maine. The book is filled with helpful maps gives you a good sense on where the adventures took place.I would recomend this book to anyone looking for a story fillled with adventure and nonstop action.
2,Don't believe the photo!,"I ordered two dozen roses (based on the photo) to congratulate my friends on their first baby girl. What actually came didn't look like flowers at all. Apparently, they are partially dehydrated ""buds"" that come with instructions on how to make them bloom. So, if you think you are sending two dozen roses, go elsewhere. My friends thought I actually sent ""seeds."" They had no idea they were roses. I have to say, Falcon Farms did deliver on time though. When I summoned their online help, their service assistant insisted she'd sent the right thing, and would not send a fresh batch of ""buds."""
1,STAY AWAY FROM FALCON FARMS!!!,"Falcon Farms cancels orders for no reason. I ordered flowers for valentines day weeks before so that I didn't have to pay insane markups the week of valentines day. A couple days before the 14th, I got a cancellation email saying that they had technical problems and they could not ship my order. BS! Now I have to go to the store and pay $9,000,000 for a dozen roses. I will never shop here again. Also, they did not even give me a full refund. They have horrible customer service. They ignore emails. They'll be hearing from Mastercard."
1,Do not buy anything from this company!,"If you value your privacy and customer service, do not buy from Falcon Farms. As you can see from their response to many many complaints, they don't care about their customers and are happy to post a standard hack response rather than truly reaching out to the affected customers. Those, who like me, not only did not receive timely notice of their orders being canceled, but who also had their email address and customer information shared across the internet."
1,Still waiting,I do not know if this is the right place to say that up to now the book has not yet arrived.Others two books bought with the same order are arrived in less than 2 weeks. This is about one month.
5,EXCELLENT STEVE FORBERT COLLECTION,"I differ from the 2 star reviewer because I do place Steve Forberts work'Right Up There' with John Prine, Greg Brown, Bob Dylan and lets not forget Tom Paxton. Each are great story tellers whose musical offerings reflect their own unique backgrounds, style and presentation, sharing with us what they personally know and live.As artists their sound differs greatly one from another, but their common ground is that All Of Their Lyrics Can Really Take You Places - the way reading a good book can.I love that kind of musical entertainment.This EXCELLENT STEVE FORBERT COLLECTION is one of my favorites."
1,What Kinda Guy: The Best of Dan Fogelberg,This is not Dan Fogelberg! It is The Best of Steve Forbert: What Kinda Guy. Amazon has advertised two different CD's as being music from Dan Fogelberg and they are not. I wish someone could explain why! If you want Dan Fogelberg you are not going to keep a CD from a guy with the name Steve Forbert. I am sending this CD back too! Isn't this a waste of money for postage? The order form enclosed with the CD clearly states What Kinda Guy: The Best of Dan Fogelberg. What's up with this Amazon??? This is a no star purchase please disregard the one star they make you give.
4,Not Romeo's tune,"My first disc from Steve Forbet. Actually, purchased it for Romeo's tune but after a few listen, its the other lesser known tracks that catch me listening to it over and over again. The recording is very good and the price too. Highly recommended."
