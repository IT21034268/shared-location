4,Surprising,"By the first three chapters, I was convinced this was the most immature book I've ever read. I thought it was a waste of time. As I continued, it became addictive. Now, by the time I finished, I'm can't wait to start book two. It was stupid, but I still loved it. The entire attitude of the characters and situations makes you think, ""I can't believe this!"" but still gets you wanting more, you just can't get enough."
1,Awful,"Gossip Girl was clearly meant to be some kind of teenage Sex and the City. In my opinion, it failed. It had no storyline to speak of, just a constant chain of pointless, meaningless and sometimes downright ludicrous events. And Gossip Girl herself, an anonymous internet scandal-monger, seemed to me to be an irritating and pointless gimmick, adding nothing to the book. The characters were shallow, bitchy, stupid and not even remotely likeable. I refuse to believe that people like this exist, in America or anywhere else. In short, it was vacuous drivel."
3,Read the book before seeing the show...,"This book is VERY different from the television show. First off, most of the kids in the book do a lot of drugs, i mean all the kids smoke, get high, and do a lot of recreational drugs.It starts off with Blair being bulimic. It goes on to mention how Dan smokes and you find out Chuck and Nate getting high in the park on the way to school. Serena is very conceited in this book, then on the show. Blair in the book is more human than in the show (ie - less b***hy). I also feel this book stays more true to lifestyle of the upper east side in manhattan. Even with the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of it.I did enjoy the book a lot though. I wouldn't say it's my favorite, but it wasn't boring either. This is more of a book for young girls, more so who aren't too impressionable, because of the activities that go on in the book.[...]"
2,ok story,"Although this story is entertaining, it failed to really grasp my attention. It's not original at all, and there is no real plot. It's just something that will sit on your Kindle; something read on a rainy day wen you're bored. Blair, Chuck, Serena and all the others are only described fleetingly. Characters are mentioned and then disappear.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Have you ever wondered what the lives of the so called chosen ones were like? Now you know. It's all about sex, lies, and video tape. Not really it's more like sex, alchohaul, drugs, and gossip gossip gossip. Which when you think about it makes it very relateable to any teenager not liveing in a hole and fun too."
1,"No Morals, No Plot, No Brains in the characters","Basically, this book is trash, when it isn't glorifying the offensive and trashy acts that it talks about, it is cussing up a storm. It focuses on drinking, drugs, and sex. There is no plot in the book. Something like a soap opera that you wish would end. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It was extremely trashy and offensive to anybody with any kind of morals"
4,"Been there, done that....","I graduated from Nightingale-Bamford in the mid-80s. I have a sister who went to Spence and another to Brearely before going to boarding school. Parents can scoff at the drinking, drugs and sex depicted in the series, but this is how it was/is.I enjoy the books - why not? It was my life.Shakespeare it is not, but everyone needs a little brain candy now and then...."
2,A time waster.,"I was very disappointed in this book. There was no true story line to it. The lifestyle of these teens seems very unrealistic. There aristocratic style and nonchalant attitude about drinking and smoking is not a ""story"" you can get in to. I would definitely NOT recommend this book unless you are looking for something that is cheesy, superficial and frankly a time waster when there are so many other great books out there that are more worth your time."
1,NYC rich life...,"I picked up the book, thinking it was gonna be something good, its about Rich Stuck Up manhattan girls who compete who is better,theres so much drama, not my ideal book...if you like drama and gossip then read the book."
3,Good....but a little inappropriate!,"This book sounded great. It talks about NYC, (my favorite city), shopping, and teeneagers. It was good don't get me wrong, but I thought it was very nasty! I think only 15 and up should read it!"
2,A Trashy Novel; Waste of My Time,"I just finished Gossip Girl today, and all I can say was that it was a waste of my time reading. Even though it was a novel, I could not believe how immature and irresponsible some teenagers, or people for that matter can be. I hated the way the girls acted toward each other and how they treated their bodies. For that matter, I was stunned at how they misused alchohol and drugs and am not even considering picking up another one of Cecily Von Ziegesar's Gossip Girl novels. She was basically showing how if you take drugs and smoke and so forth, that you will be cool in your school, have lots of friends, money and be able to do whatever you want. That is so very wrong; I despised the views in this book and hope that people who read it will not act as the characters did."
3,gossip Girl from a male standpoint,"The book is well written, yes, but hard written as a girl's first sexual experience. The rivalry between some of the girls in their search for the appropriate male for the first bonding is a good touch and includes a peek into the status of the wealthier strata and its outlook on itself and all the others, the total lack of compassion, sympathy, or even understanding well set out in the novel, as well as the standing of some of the Ivy League schools. There is a brief mention of subjects taught in the private school the girls attend and their attitude towards those subjects ( subject matter does not matter). Social standing is almost dictated by financial standing and size of apartment, and location. The novel continues to dither towards the end, at which point the girls have resolved their partners and their standings."
1,This book wasn't for me,"There are so many girls who read these books at my school, and I have no clue how they can actually like it. The writing was on a fourth grade level and the content was on a tenth grade level. The mature content didn't bother me so much, but how the author tried to make it seem like it was soooo outrageous when it wasn't that bad, now that irked me. I tried to find a character I liked, but it was too hard and so I gave up. The characters were too shallow to identify with, even the ones that would be considered the deep outsiders. The plot was too dry and to me it was also very predictable. The only thing that I liked about this book was the idea of an anonymous GossipGirl devulging details. I may have lost brain cells in the process of reading this book. Caution: Read at your own risk, people!!!"
5,Excellent & Practical!,"I have pretty much all the popular analog IC design books and this one is the most useful! It covers a wide variety of circuits, and explains many practical issues that are useful to someone getting starting in actually making circuits that work. Plus there are tons of examples to make everything stick...even SPICE files of everything on the web! The only thing this book doesn't have (which it would be impossible to fit plus is covered ad nauseum in the others) is in-depth theory. In conclusion, this book rocks and you will kick yourself if you miss it."
1,Difficult Text,"If you are beginning CMOS analog design,please dont use this.There is very brief theory to supplement and equally insufficient physical explanations;maybe for an experienced industry professional this sort of approach suffices,but certainly this is not the text to follow.It has obvious advantages since a website with solutions is devoted to the text but that in no way compensates for the poor quality of material-it is very difficult to develop physical understanding out of this book.Maybe using Alan Gerbene's text (Bipolar and MOS Analog Design)alongside this book will help,actually it worked fine for me."
5,"CRISTINA DEL VALLE, AFTER AMISTADES PELIGROSAS","After having took part in the greatest Spanish music band, Amistades Peligrosas, Cristina sings alone in her first cd. A travel around new ethnic sounds and rhythm in which Cristina's voice sounds as hot as ever.If you enjoyed Amistades Peligrosas, you will enjoy this more!! sure!"
4,Callan's Proposition,"Cute,funny story about a man who will do anything to keep an efficient secretary. When an animated piece of office machinery ( the secretary ) stops fucntioning, Callan Sinclair is willing to do whatever it takes to put things back in order. He doesn't have a clue about how involved he will become. I enjoyed the book."
4,Still waters run deep ( I know it's a cliche),"Back Cover description: THE SECRETARY'S SEDUCTION. Outside the office, Callan Sinclair didn't know that Abigail Thomas existed. But Abigail had definitely noticed the broad shoulders and intense brown eyes of her employer. His powerful presence had taken her breath away more than once-and the fantasy of his kisses kept her up at night. But Abigail's current situation called for more than fantasy-she needed a real fiance, or she'd be forced to leave. That was when Callan noticed the curves his conservative secretary had been hiding. Their counterfeit engagement was perfect-but was the arrangement business or pleasure?One of the better books in this series. Quite a few laughs, and some funny dialogue. The two aunts are at times too much, but the author makes it move along and all ends well."
5,Beautiful in Blue,"I have thePinkversion of this necklace, and was thrilled to find a blue version offered. Since I have a similar necklace, I knew what to expect in terms of size, but otherwise I would have thought this necklace was smaller than I would have pictured it. (This is one of the few necklaces that Amazon does not list any sizing information for.) The photo does not do justice to the luster and shine of the necklace. The cat's eye is vibrant and beautiful, especially when the light catches the stone."
2,Works fine but doesn't retract easily,"You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract. The wire is very thin, so I'm thinking it will not last long."
1,Not worth it!!!!,Terrible product. Casing cheap plastic. Case cracked within days of getting the watch. Got that replaced and the place with watch band pins connect broke off. Got that replaced and the same thing on the next.
5,Essential Recordings,"These recordings with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic are the definitive versions of these pieces. It doesn't get any better than this, excellent performances. An outstanding buy."
5,Bernstein at his best,"I am not a big fan of Bernstein. He usually has a very heavy hand, lacks subtlety, projects his own personality too much into the performance. This collection is an exception. Bernstein and Copland were made for each other. Bernstein's passion for American music is, for a change, reverent here and leads to an intelligent and sensitive reading. His performance of Appalachian Spring is definitive. Absolutely gorgeous. One of the best recordings of Copland around. Highly recommended."
4,"A good performance, but not the best","I know that Leonard Berstein is the recognized master at interpreting his good friend Copland, but this recording simply isn't the best one out there. Sure, the 3 Copland pieces are classics and absolutely wonderful to listen to, but I found Berstein's interpretation a bit lacking at times.For example, the brass seems inexplicably weak throughout most of Appalachian Spring--just when they should be making their triumphant entrance. And at times, we hear Berstein's constant love of slowing down all pieces he does. It doesn't work so well here.No doubt about it, any lover of music needs these three pieces on CD, but you can do better. Eric Kunzel's relatively recent Cincinnati Pops recording seems to evoke the true emotion of Copland better, for example."
2,Does It Ever Stop?,"Yet another printing of timeless old war horses of American serious music! This is just another way for Sony to make a few bucks off of stuff they've had laying around for decades. (""Nothing new here, folks. Move along."")Is the music good? Of course! Along with ""Rhapsody in Blue"" these selections are the most purchased pieces of American music in the category.Should you have this recording? Well, look at it this way: If you'd like to have a Xeroxed copy of the New York Times for December 7th, 1941, I suppose you couldn't get hurt....except that it's a copy...and copies always are lacking in integrity. This CD is no different. The sound is, to me, lacking.I wouldn't buy it. Why? Well, I've had these pieces in my library for 25 years."
2,I would advise choosing a different reading,"I bought this on the strength of Bernstein's excellent work in west side story and his orchestral reputation. But the rhythms are not in sync! the notes are out of tune! Incredible. in the crucial start of Jupiter, perhaps the most sseminal moment of the recording, the strings are not quite together! Listen to Karajan's version, or Slatkin's one. Also the horns on this recording are not in tune all the time?! I have listened to this recording for years and years, played orchestral music many times, and something is missing here. But this is a great piece of music, don't avoid it because of this recording. I just want to make sure no one wastes the money like I did."
5,Never better,"After trying several sunblocks in the market and thos recommended by dermatologists, this is the best that I have ever used. It makes my face smooth and looking younger. It even smells good."
5,Interesting,"Having personally visited Hiroshima, the Atomic museum and the iconic bombed out concrete dome, I am always looking for more information about this terrible time in history. The interviews with survivors and their descendants gives a glimpse into the horror. I learned much from this video."
5,Subtle and moving,"For a 2007 HBO production, the makers here found plenty of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors to tell their tales of destruction and suffering. I particularly liked the modern scenes of those cities with no trace of the past, except for the cemeteries and the peace memorial, very eerie. They also found many of the US pilots who dropped the two bombs that ended WW2. There is a definite anti-war sentiment here, but it does not detract from the documentary style. You will learn from this well made film."
5,Must Watch,I could go on and on about this film. I'll only say that it is DEEPLY important that this period in World History be VIVIDLY remembered so that we do not lose touch with our humanity in the face of such catastrophic power. This film captures that humanity effortlessly. The most moving documentary I have seen in a long long time. I would go so far as to beg people to see it. Educate yourself.
4,More of a critique of the synopsis above,"Fat Man and Little Boy were not the first ""thermonuclear"" weapons used in war because they weren't thermonuclear bombs at all, which are hundreds of times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Japan. Thermonuclear weapons refer to fusion bombs, i.e. the H-bomb.Words do mean things. This is not to down play what happened at all, but it is there is very large difference between the two types of bombs. There is little sense in marring a good documentary by posting an exaggeration in the description."
4,Nice for the price,I am slightly clausterphobic and I use this clear liner as our shower curtain. It makes our stall size shower seem larger and more open. It is fairly heavy/decent quality and is priced low enough so I can just replace it when it starts looking dirty.
5,Great Music & Great Teaching,"My almost 6 yr. old received this book and CD as a gift from my parents, and we are all loving it! We listen to it in the car and sing along to its upbeat and catchy tunes. The music is much more sophisticated than any other ""kids music"" I've listened to (and I have 3 little ones). What's more, my daughter has been spewing forth trivia about how long her hair can grow if never cut, how her lungs work, and how many bones are in her body! I think this is a great purhcase, and I highly recommend it."
5,Absolutely Loved It!,My 6 and 5yo love this songbook. The songs are easy to pick up on and are so cute! My kids are learning about the human body without even knowning it. ;)
5,Laugh out loud!,"Great book! This satire of the American fast food industry and culture has plenty of very funny laugh out loud moments. Starbuck does a great job developing his characters while telling a funny, entertaining and meaningful story."
4,Good economy whistles,Bought these for a youth kayak trip. They worked fine and were loud as you would expect a whistle to be. Plus the price was right.
5,A long wait that was well worth it,"I've been listening to these guys since ""Meet Me at the Fair"" came out and a friend loaned it to me. Bought my own copy and just about wore it out. Ditto their EP. This cd hasn't left my cd player for 5 days now. Not one filler song. The band is versatile, never boring, easy to listen to but not simple. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be ""Sofkuri's Room"" - it's just a beautiful beautiful song, But I also think ""Moving Target"" is great, ""Everything Shines"", ""Cash""...actually there's not one I don't like. I can hear just about anyone of them on the radio - this is substance with simplicity - an art form in itself. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,quite good,"I bought this cd based on a recommendation from an on-line friend and boy am I glad I did. There are so many good songs on the cd and they are all a little different. The last song on the cd ""Cadillac"" is worth the price of the cd alone. Highly recommended."
5,"Catchy Tunes, intelligent lyrics, a must have!","This disc has quickly become one of my favorites. I recently saw The Push Stars as the opening band for Julian Lennon in Philly. I had never heard of them before but I couldn't forget them after the show. This disc has it all. Each song is a must listen to. This band has captured pure pop/rock excellence without overdoing it. The band is tight and the songs are catchy and the lyrics are real life. Everyone can relate to this disc. If you buy one disc this year, The Push Stars ""After the Party"" is the one. This band is going to be big."
5,...the new best kept secret in rock.............,the lyrics and melodies will get you out to see them....the live performance will make you fans for life..these guys mean it.....be the first on your block!
5,Another Great Band out of Boston.,"One of the best new albums of 1999...Great lyrics and music...See them live if you can, high energy pop that will be around for a long time. One of my favorite new albums.It is now 2 years later, and ""After the Party"" is still in my top 10 rotation of music. ""Any Little Town"" is still great, as is the rest of the album. I still like this one better than ""Opening Time"", the newer one. Trust me and buy this one.Liam"
5,GR8 Air Filter Wrap without the FANCY $$,"This air filter wrap works and looks just as good as ACCEL's or other name brand high priced wraps! I did my research before I purchased,to make sure it would fit."
5,Authentic down to the marrow.,"After being blown away by the Joan's authetic admission of her own (human) inauthenticity in 'Bare Bones Meditation', I've discovered that it is possible to be authentic beyond the bare bones. In this book she reaches down to the marrow. A true dharma heir to Bodhidharma or to the trafic jam occuring just now, whichever you prefer."
3,Overpriced!,"Although this book... ahem... pamphlet is wonderful it is only 37 pages of actual content, in the original typeset, and at $13.50 is a bit too much. I would have felt better if I had paid $5. Or less. Oh well. I've spent $13+ on worse things! I did give it 3 stars instead of 1 because it is Ernest Holmes after all!"
2,little info,"This seems like an outline for other, more complete books on the subject. Some of the excercises are intended for adults yet seem appropriate for ten year olds. All of the info here could be found in other books and then some."
4,50% of it was useful,"Although I wouldn't consider all the tips to be practical I did find many useful ones. I've been using some of the ideas with my classes, and I've found I have made improvements that the students seem to enjoy. With some of the tips I have made my own modifications. This book helped me either use her ideas, or come up with some of your own. It was motivational for me."
3,77 tips -- Maybe 10 are worth trying,"Being an adult computer instructor for almost 4 years, I've tried a lot of different things to motivate the students. Most of the 77 tips in this book would serve more as distractions than aids. For example, one tip has each student with 3 cups (red, yellow, and green). If a student understands the topic being covered, they show the green cup. If they're not sure, yellow and if their lost, red. I have yet to meet ANY student in my experiences who would rotate their cups to keep up with the topics being covered. Another area of the book recommends waiting a full minute for a response to a question! I tried this once, and after 35 seconds a student asked me to repeat the question...."
1,This person calls herself an author?,"When I came across this book in a friends bathroom and took a look through it, I saw why it was in the ""john"". This was one of the most poorly written adult instruction books I have ever seen. The so-called author uses contractions and imcomplete sentence structure throughout the book. It is not clear and concise. I wonder what publisher would agree to take on this mess. As another review states, it seems more like something a 10 year old would use. Perhaps this want to be author should spend her time doing something other than writing."
3,Wow,This album is awesome. it is like nothing i have ever heard before. this is like fast spanish punk and it is awesome not like you need to tell what they are saying because plenty of great punk bands slurr there words together. i would really by this cd.i would have given it a 5 star but i cant satisfy a mexican.
1,price to high,"would buy from sauna suit from amazon price way to high,am a prime member many thanks! suppose to be 99 dollars, for 2 suits 149.00"
5,"HELLO IT""S MAC!!",This is a much needed neutral colour for anyone who wears make up. It has a satin finish so no glimmer or glittery finish on the brow bone. A must have for any girl or guys make up pallet.
3,"Fun, funky, yet it needs more vocals please!","Who doesn't love Julie London, Louis Prima, and Peggy Lee singing their best? I would love it more if you had let Audrey Hepburn sing Moon River (you know, Breakfast at Tiffany's). Don't answer yet, think about how fab that would be. And don't tease me with the others...let the singers do their thing!"
5,It's Great,"The variety and quality of Lounge genre music found on the ""Ultra Lounge"" samplers, is enough to put Lounge as my most favoured music form. I now want to collect all 23 CDs that the samples were mined from."
5,We love this cd,My daughter is a big fan of this kind of music and anything tiki. This was a Christmas present for her and she loves it. Great quality and prompt service from Amazon. Thanks!
5,ADORE IT!!,This cat leather key chain is adorable. My friend had bought me one in the airport in Italy. I lost it and was so excited to find the exact one online. It's very well made and I get lots of compliments. Any one of his leather key chains would be an artistic treasure to use everyday.
5,Great Medieval Romance!,"Delightful medieval set in late 1100's. The heroine is a ""bit"" older than the hero believes...and she has a few surprises in store for him later! Some he will like, some he will wonder about! He never expected to have to find a wife, ever, now he wonders if he married the right woman. This is a delighfully sexy, well written story that is true to medieval times plus a great romance. Annie T.D."
3,Feels flimsy,"These chairs look nice, but feel a little flimsy. When I initially sat in them, I heard a few ""cracks"". Upon inspection, I cannot see any damage, but suspect that the ""powder"" coating at the weld points may have something to do with this. Also, beneath the cushion are aluminum slats that go side-to-side and after using these chairs for ~1 month, I noticed that the slats have a slight bow from my weight. I weigh ~190lbs, so I fall within the capacity limits (250lbs) of these chairs. I felt that the rust-proof aluminum patio furniture would last, but I'm now a little concerned about the quality of materials and craftsmanship. I also own the Faulkner dining chair with arms and those feel a little more durable. I guess only time will tell."
5,Great looking & sturdy!,"I bought this set because I was drawn to the style - very similar to sets I'd checked out at Pottery Barn, but about 1/3 the cost. WE LOVE IT!!!! SO glad we took the chance and bought it online. The cushions, as mentioned by another reviewer, are not as waterproof as they should be, so I took their advice and Scotchguarded them. 5 storms later, and they're doing just fine! Our friends and neighbors have all commented on the set, and asked where we got it. They arrived FAST, so that was nice, too. Easy set-up (The chairs were already assembled), and the table took us less than 15 min. As for the welding, which another reviewer mentioned was poor, it does not ruin the look, nor does it affect the stability of the pieces. I'm more inclined to think it gives them an artisan appeal. :)"
5,Lovely Chairs,I ordered these chairs when the sling style chairs we used for years started to rip and fray. Earlier this season I ordered a Strathwood table which is wonderful so I figured I'd go with their chairs.They arrived in a timely fashion and look great. They also have a slightly higher seat than the last chairs which is much more comfortable when you're eating (also much better for digestion).Highly recommended!
5,Patio chairs,"Bought these for my mother, she was a bit leery about what the build quality would be. When we received them we were so pleased to find them of superior build!A great buy, nice looking, super chairs!"
2,Dead on arrival,"This item ,a refurbised humminbird 787c2i,was dead on arrival. Very unhappy with quality control.This sould have been inspected before selling to me. BEWAREHumminbird 787c2i Combo Color Fish Finder with Internal GPS Receiver"
5,WORTH the FOURTH,"Yes - Bernstein has always taken the first movement of the fifth with weight!I may agree that the first movement of Symp 5 is under where I hear it, however the playing is done with commitment, and the rest of the symphony is wonderful.And yes, here Bernstein provides what may be the slowest recorded tempo of the first movement to date (perhaps it's worth it alone for that reason!?) -- however the freshness and vitality that LB and the NYP display on the Fourth Symphony is nothing short of breathtaking!It's pure Bernstein - it's fresh, it's youthful, it's bliss, it's ecstasy. This is one of the finest takes of Beethoven 4 I know of - which is probably Beethoven's most under-estimated symphony. Bernstein captures the exact character needed to sell this work.A very exciting read of Egmont as well.This CD is WORTH THE FOURTH!!"
3,Lethargic reading of the 5th,"I had purchased this CD of the 5th thinking that I could not go wrong with Bernstein, but then had the ""misfortune"" of hearing Kleiber's recording with the VPO on DG and realized just how lethargic and slow Bernstein's reading of the first movement is. The difference in time is well over 1 minute, and I now find it difficult listening to the Bernstein version without inwardly exulting them to speed it up. Of course, every great conductor is allowed their own interpretation, but I find that the NYPO on this recording sounds sluggish and anaesthetized.(Sorry, but I cannot comment on the 4th since I am not educated enough on this particular work to make any critical review.)"
3,Great Interpretation....but that's all...,"It is difficult to pass up a recording of the Cleveland Symphony, especially on peices that rely so heavily on the string section, that orchestra being wrold-renowned for its strings. Being a huge fan myself, I couldn't resist the recording, but I was quite dissapointed with the quality. The interpretation is absolutely fabulous, but the intonation is simply terrible in some places, especially the Corolionus Overture. There are also rhythmic problems in a few of the peices, something that astounds me, coming from an orchestra of such high regard. This is probably worth the money if you can't find a better recording, but I wouldn't pay a cent more."
3,As usual Szell is a pedant...,What is missing here is a recorded sound that blooms on loudspeakers...even my old LP of Karajan Overtures is warmer and more tonally enticing...what is wrong with the pitch in the horns in the Fidelio? It is all over the map in terms of pitch accuracy...excruciating horn work for some reason here...go to Berlin and Karajan for a better concept of tone and technique....
1,Don't throw away your money,"This is the worst ""heater"" I ever had. Lighting a match would put out more heat than this thing. It's light as a feater and makes no noise. Only problem it has is that it does not put out enough heat to warm any room that a person could fit into. It should be advertisd as a closet heater.Don't buy this thing."
1,Beware FIRE,Same problem as other reviewer...Smoke!! I have 3 kids and this thing scared the heck out of me!!! I don't think I will buy another Bionaire product!!
5,Bionaire BH 3950 U silent Micathermic Heater,I am very happy with this heater. It is handy because you can roll it if you need to move it. It heats up the room fast and well. I think that is all I could ask for. I am heating a 360 square foot space and it does fine. It is on a temperature control which is handy.
4,Be aware before you buy,"I purchased the Bionaire BH3950-U Silent Micathermic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat because of a recommendation of a friend. It works by heating elements inside and the heat RISES. I use this heater in my lower level office in my home and wanted it to heat the room. It does a nice job of doing that. But my only complaint is that my legs and feet remain ""chilly"".The instructions claim the heat rises and forces down the warm air to the floor and heats it up all over again. That may be true. But my feet feel the chill. I can honestly say it works in my 12X12 office to warm the room. But it's not like another type of heater with a fan that blows the warm air toward where you point it."
3,"It's not silent, it clicks on and off!","I find that this heater does heat well, but every time the heater turns on and off it issues an on click or an off click. It's very audible! How they can call this silent is beyond me."
4,"Quiet, dark, very toasty!","The heater is actually quite remarkable. It puts out a truly great amount of warmth, the thermostat works quite well, and most importantly, it allows our baby to sleep while the unit is operating. We had a quartz-type heater before that heats up three metal strips, but our baby would always wake up because the fan would kick on and the room would glow orange. Not so with this unit-- it's quiet, and when the lights are off, the room stays dark.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because it took nearly 3 hours of continuous running outside until a burning plastic smell finally went away. Make sure you don't turn it on initially in your house, or you'll have to open all the windows for an hour to get rid of the smell.Otherwise, really a great product."
5,Excellent portable heater,"I have 3 of these heaters at home. In smaller to medium rooms, I turn the dial up to the third or fourth ""dot"" and it heats up the room really well. Not noisy at all. For larger rooms- we have an open floor plan, turning the dial all the way up warms the entire floor easily. I love its portability and does what it is supposed to do extremely well. I highly recommend this heater."
2,HEATER AND SMOKER,"Mine started to smoke. I took it apart and found melted wires. I was able to rewire it to run on low only and have since had no trouble. NEVER RUN THIS HEATER ON HIGH. IT IS AN EXTREME FIRE HAZZARD. Good for smoking meat and game, too! Great silent unit. Too far a range between on and off on thermostat setting (3 degrees instead of 1 like the previous Bionaire Console Heater I had)"
3,Wonderful,This product met my expectations and I am glad I got it because the weather seems to be signaling some nasty Winter and it will come handy.
3,Could be Toxic,"This heater works well enough. It's light, easy to move about & quiet.Just the qualities I was looking for. But my sample had a very strong, clearly toxic, odor. Yes it diminished after a while. But the following winter it was there again - this time even worse than before, leading me to suspect that there may always be some residual emission of whatever this chemical concoction may be. And this year it to took several days to go away. Perhaps it's only with some samples. Chinese ""quality control"" is hardly stellar. On the other hand, their concern for consumer health & the environment is even worse. For this reason I would be hesitant to recommend."
1,Handle doesn't stay in place,"I'm returning this heater without ever turning it on. The heater has a handle that just snaps in place--but it snaps out as soon as you try to move the unit with the handle. I suppose I could ""baby"" the unit when I want to move it, but I'm offended at such cheap construction, and it make me doubt the overall quality and safety of the heater (especially given the very mixed reviews it has earned). What was the manufacturer thinking? They don't even provide a simple screw or some other reliable means of attaching the handle."
3,Quiet heater,"Works wellBUT for BOTH the units they delivered, wheels did not fix the Axle hubso it could tip over.Chinese junk quality .. but it works, except for the consistently delivered misfitting wheels."
4,it is good with little downside,in all...it is a good heater..very quick to warm the room and lighttwo not so good thing:1. smell for the first time use and need to at least 5 hours to get away2. the temperature control is a little too sensitive..so when the room is achieved the setting temperature..it will shut off and on in a 2 or 1 minute cycle..a little bit sound..kinda noise at night.but in all this is a very good heater...havent used for one month and will wait to see how much the electric bill will come..
5,quiet & warm,"Produces good heat & is very quiet. I can't speak to its electrical usage, as we haven't received our bill yet. We have a very large bedroom and when we use our wood stove and not our furnace, that room gets little heat then, so we needed a substitute heater for that room. This does the job perfectly. We only set it on the lowest setting and about 1/4 turn. It is amazing! Others said there was a bad order when they first used theirs. While there was a slight oder, it was gone after running it only about an hour or so and it was not untolerable."
3,sam,Pros: Produces good amount of heatMostly quietCons: Thermostat is very noisy and annoyingThermostat will flip on and off every few min when reaching desired temperatureOther: Must do an initial warm-up outdoors. Very smokey and smelly first time use.Highly recommend usingLux WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat
4,quiet room heater,"One room in our house is always colder than the rest, despite the central heating system. It is our baby's nursery, and we began using this heater to compensate for the poor heating performance of our central heater in this room. What I like best about this heater is that it is completely silent. Also, I believe it is safer than other heaters, because the sides do not get hot. They get warm, but it seems the sides are used to take in air, and the heat comes out from the top.The thermostat is not calibrated with numbers, but we found a setting we are comfortable with (approximately dot number two), and just leave it there all winter."
5,"Very Quiet, Good Heat","Have used a couple times only and it does a good job. No sound -- just heat. Using in a large room with high ceiling so whole room doesn't get real warm, but you can feel a difference when you walk in from other parts of the house."
4,nice space heater,does a fair job heating the area i bought it for. Fairly well built. does not get very hot to the touch.
5,Love it,This product meets or excess my expectations. It warm the area quickly. It is low energy and very safe.
1,Fire Hazard!,"I was ecstatic with this heater for the first two months that I had it. It was quiet and indeed could heat my whole 11 by 17 foot bedroom. However, this morning I smelled smoke. I unplugged the heater and found that the plug and my electrical outlet were charred and melted. Thankfully I caught it in time."
1,not a happy camper,This product sounded so good on the web. However I would never reccommend this heater to anyone. It only heats in the immediate area of a person. You literally have to be sitting next to it to feel any warmth. Save your money!
2,Won't save you $ as advertised.,"the product is good in terms of quietness and produce good heat. however, beware. my electric bill jumps 3X when i use it keep it turned on all the time. compared to last year bills, my new electric and gas total bill this year is significantly higher each month."
3,A lot of plastic for 90 bucks!,This thing does not put out the heat I expected and is made of cheap plastic from top to bottom. The only one in our house who thinks it was worth 90 bucks is the cat.I would urge someone looking for a heater to check another unit before spending money on this one. Really disappointing too because I bought bit based on reviews here at Amazon. Oh well.....live and learn.
3,"High Tech design, however I question the longivety?","What can you say about the design; High tech heater that really does work.I bought two of these five years ago, I had to heat a home with three units, the other unit was a oil filled radiator type heater.For one winter these were used constantly, and the oil filled heater still is working, but one of these units had a failure of one of the heat plates. It will not heat, but the other two plates in the unit still work.It looks as tho you can replace the plates in the unit, it's just bolted in. I have not contacted Bionare for replacement parts yet.But it is interesting that these units still operate even with a failed heat plate, at a reduced capacity of course.This is the highest tech heater out there, but with anything high-tech, it's just not built for longevity. However I would expect replacement parts to be available for a long time, this is a great unit."
5,Great Product - Owned 3 for past 2 years,Really an amazing space heater. We use in the bedrooms in the evenings as the programmable thermostat kills the heat to the rest of the house. They produce a lot of heat and can bring the temperature up in a generously sized room in just a few minutes. Purchased at Costco.
4,A heating advance,"An effective, very lightweight slim heater. There is an initial smell but it gradually lessens after a few uses. This is a big advance over oil-filled space heaters-smaller,lighter & nothing to leak."
4,Great Little Heater,This is really a great little heater. It is whisper quiet and very dependable. I have been very happy. Good Luck
3,Doesn't heat my room like DeLonghi model,"I purchased this model back in late 2011, so I've used it for several months now. It is quiet, but just doesnt heat my 13 x 20 room like the previous Delonghi model I owed. The heater has to be right next to you to feel the heat. I plan to keep it as long as it's operational, but will return to the Delonghi model when it's time to replace it."
2,Very Disappointed,After having read the majority of the reviews for this heater I really had fairly high expectations for it. I wanted to replace the Lasco 75800 Cyclonic heater we use to heat the bedroom because of the length of time it took for the heater to warm the room. The room is about 11' X 15'with an 8 foot ceiling. Unfortunately the heater doesn't work as well as the Lasco which I will continue to use. We'll use this heater in a smaller room. I was very surprised that it didn't work better since it puts out warm air on both sides and through the top of the heater. In any event I don't recommend it.
3,Should've Been Called Tanya XXX!,"Tanya X is 2 hours and 12 minutes of pure softcore fluff. It's okay for what it is, but there wasn't enough comedy in it for my taste."
3,Tanya x,"i received this product on 07/25 the day after it was released which is fine. my problem with it was that the way product wsa described as season 1 all 12 episodes included made it sound like ALL the B.I.K.I.N.I. movies starring Beverly lynne were going to be included i have seen this movie on cinemax and it DOES NOT have the repetitiveness that this DVD has. i will keep it but please next time try and kep all 12 episodes season one out of there cuz it doesn't make sense when it is 1 movie. i thought it was gonna be like the robert wagner series "" it takes a thief"" but nooooo. thx for heaing me out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BWR"
3,Disappointment,"I was looking for a hardcore Beverly Lynne show and, when this was advertised as complete and uncut I assumed it was hardcore. When shows are softcore they should explicitly say that."
5,Great product,"Easy to digest. Not tasty, but I feel a noticeable difference when I take these vitamins vs. days I miss taking them - something that I never noticed with vitamin pills in the past. I have been taking this particular vitamin for years now and would still recommend All One!"
1,Dont waste your money,"I liked the smell... But that is about it. Its hard to lather up. When it finally does it breaks down so fast i ended up applying it to my face, shave, then applying it to my neck, shave again. Its not worth all the trouble for a soap that doesnt cushin all that well anyway."
5,"Gorgeous and captivating, unlike any other soundtrack","There are countless original pieces that go into movies, however Perfume's soundtrack was simply stunning.Perfume itself is a fantastic movie, and listening to the soundtrack you can tell that it illustrates the movie beautifully. The music is captivating - I like my fair share of classical music, but I was very surprised that a fairly modern composition could be so gripping. With a world-class orchestra, and fantastic choir, and two stunning sopranos, the soundtrack rises above all the rest.Of course, like any soundtrack, it is made to fit a movie, so some pieces are a little too short lived or take a while to get started, but each one is as beautiful as the next. The music truly captures the theme and essence of the movie, and is wonderful to listen to on it's own.Wonderful, gorgeous work."
5,Nonument is Monumental,"I have not stopped playing Nonument since I got it. This by far is 4AD's best release in 2002--the album also ranks in my year's best. If you are looking for experimental/ambient music--with an occasional dance tune--well, this is the cd for you. Nonument is a combination of electronic music, trumpet, cello guitars and ethereal vocals. My favorite tracks are The Fourth Day and Three Sided. My only complaint is that the excellent single, Scene of the Crime, is not included in this cd. Oh yeah, the design includes some really interesting photography."
3,"Refreshing interpretation, substandard sound and playing","Bernstein's first heroic and historic Mahler cycle for CBS is quite almost the most satisfying complete 'one-conductor-mahler-cycle' available. It would have been a completely satisfying cycle were it not for this Fifth.There really isn't any need to elaborate, even when the orchestra would have played with the distinction they gave the Third, Seventh, Sixth and about every other Mahler symphony in the cycle, they would have been beaten by a dismal sound recording which is, even by 1960's standards, completely unsatisfying. Too bad, because I feel Bernstein's view of the work (not as mannered as his fabled remake with the Vienna Philharmonic) is quite refreshing. Ah well, perhaps this is just as well, a completely flawless Mahler cycle doesn't exsist and neither should we be searching for one. Mahler himself, after all, wasn't perfect."
2,"Bernstein doesn't connect, nor does the orchestra","It's a mystery why a great Mahler conductor like Bernstein didn't ""get"" the Mahler Fifth, which almost every other respectable Mahlerian conducts very well. This recording comes close to being a mess. None of the tempos are out of line, being either very fast or very slow, but there is no logic or line to any of the movements (ecept for a lovely, moderately paced Adagietto), just shapeless gestures.The opening trumpet solo is quavery and insecure, the pace tends to drag everywhere it shouldn't, and overall Bernstien seems completely at sea. Who knows why? This is the only serious blemish in his 1960s Mahler cycle from New YOrk--even the sound is congested and uncomfortable. Ufortunately, the better played, better recorded remake with the Vienna Phil. from 1987 isn't much improved in conception--the tempos are slow4er and just as draggy."
3,Can only concur:,I can only concur with J. Scott Morrison's review - again! We seem to hear and see the same in viewing opera videos. I was surprised to hear Crider do as well on Vissi and not surprised by Bumbry who is one of my favorite mezzo sopranos. I've heard much better Nessum Dorma's but overall enjoyed this gala very much. I too could not erase Fleming's Hymn to the Moon but love the Canadian soprano whom I've heard several times live. She is wonderful! I do recommend this concert to all opera lovers! How nice to see an audience dress with respect for the artists or one heck of a party afterward! The shots of the audience were as much fun as the performers. J. Scott Morrison is right on all his points. A nice addition to an opera collection.
3,"Decent product. I have seen sticker stuff, but it works.","It's an ok product for the money. I've seen sticky mats with stickier surfaces. What can you say about the product. It works well, but I've seen stuff that works better (my problem is that I can't find the better stuff).The silly red ""Type S"" logo could attract more thief attention than I might like."
1,RUINED MY SAAB!!,"This item ruined my dashboard in my Saab!! When I brought it back to the automotive store I purchased it from I was told to contact the company, which doesn't seem to have a phone number. I brought my car to the dealership and was told that it will cost $495.00 to have it fixed!!! If anyone knows how to reach this company please let me know!!"
4,Good all the way up until the end. . .,"I'll give the author credit. They did keep me highly interested until the end. I thought the storyline was unique and interesting, but the ending just didn't rise to the level as the rest of the story. All in all, it was a good read."
1,I Would Not Recommend,"I very excited about this book and was horribly disappointed when I started reading it.Official ""Ro"" Reasoning:*Spoiler Alert*(-2 Stars) This novel was not a well-written novel with many parts being confusing and unclear.(-2 Stars) The plot was not a well-thought out one. David came across as a crazed stalker and Tyne had little connection with her past, and almost no connection to David.Official ""Ro"" Rating: 1 Star, Would Definitely Not Recommend."
1,Didn't like it,"I didn't like this book. It is going on my pile of ""books to donate"". I'm sure someone else who likes this genre will gobble it up."
4,Try something new,"The interracial aspect and the slight similarity to A.S. Byatt's ""Possession"" attracted me to Sharon Cullars' ""Again"", and I wasn't disappointed. Though the contemporary protagonists conflict didn't quite match the historical protagonists conflict and the last quarter of the book felt rushed, Cullars' skill at creating three-dimensional, mature protagonists of David and Tyne, the deftly-handled and subtle chemistry between the two and their slow, sensual dance of a relationship made this a stellar debut. I look forward to reading more from Cullars and highly recommend this book if you're looking for a new author to support. Sharon Cullars has proven herself to be an author to watch."
4,Wonderful Writing,"I was really impressed not only by the writing style of this author but the story itself. ""Again"" is a definite page turner, where the author toggles back and forth from the late 1800s to the present. I especially loved how Mrs. Cullars was able to stay true to each genre with her writing style. I recommend this novel to any die hard romance readers."
4,Kismet,"Again by Sharon Cullars (4.5)Tyne is a mid-thirties career woman who has struck out in love time and again. But her days are distracted by the erotic visits she receives every night from a handsome stranger --- who meets her in her dreams.David can't seem to escape from the hold his dreams have on him. His life is spiraling out of control from the incessant pull of a mystery woman. But there's something else just beneath the surface; a truth that could shatter everything he thought he knew about himself.Again by Sharon Cullars allows readers a glimpse into the past and the present with a healthy dose of pure desire. Eloquently laced with the pull of soul mate desire, Again is a taste of something extraordinary."
4,Interesting Story.,Story was interesting but a bit disturbing at times. You really don't understand what happened until the end - which i guess is normal. But my feelings towards the male character were difficult to like during the story until the end. I almost stopped reading it a couple of times because of the dislike of the aggresiveness of the male character. (too much personal experience with that!)
5,Very Pleased!,This was an excellent Christmas gift. My uncle was ecstatic with the movies. He couldn't believe that I found Hopalong Cassidy on DVD. He grew up going to the movie theater to see his favorite cowboy.
5,Hoppy Rules,"These are GREAT DVD's. As everyone else says, the quality is excellent. It really brings back memories. Grace's recollections are great in the special documentary. It's too bad there weren't other documentaries made about Bill Boyd-his transition into Hoppy was a real story (worthy of a movie in itself-hint, hint). Please share this set with the youngers. Maybe they'll get themselves some capguns and run around the neighborhood like we did and LOSE SOME WEIGHT!"
1,Very upsetting,This was one of the gifts I got for my husbands 30th birthday. I wanted it to be perfect nothing like pic. Very upset and now I have to deal with a return.
1,and the reason for writing the book was: ______________?,"Planning to relocate to Paris? Maybe just thinking about it? Mulling over what problems you will encounter? Then do NOT buy this book. Suzy spends more time babbling about her preparations to bed a still-married geriatric aristocrat. Pathetic. Fortunately I did not buy the copy I read, I found it on a park bench in town. No wonder it had been abandoned...I am HalMcInnes, bye."
3,fun rip thru paris with some pangs,"If you take this book as just an inside look into a widow's go-it-alone establishment in Paris after the passing of her husband, then I think you will get enjoyment out of her daily adventures. You also might get some good advice on culture and home hunting in Paris. (However, keep in mind that this woman had many contacts and previous experience in Paris, oh yeah, and a pretty big wad of money.)Unfortunately, to me it seemed that she could have been a little more emotional about the loss of her lifelong husband and about her son's feelings. I perceived mostly self-centered thoughts in her decisions. I only mention this because it kind of dragged down an otherwise lighthearted, funny story for me.Overall, I would say it is worth a quick weekend read if you have some down time."
2,Not A Memoir,"I bought this book with the anticipation that it would be a woman's personal and emotional journey in the city I have always adored. Instead, the author has a rather cold demeanor throughout and this book reads far more like a how-to for moving to Paris than an actual experience. This is not SO bad, but collective shopping trips and apartment hunting antecedotes do NOT a memoir make!I also found the author's reflection on her loss to be very callous and detached. I understand that everyone copes in their own way but the book was described in a very different light than it actually read. Definitely not worth buying or reading unless you want to move to Paris and need a game plan. More like Travel, not Travel Writing.If you want a really fun and witty memoir about Paris pick up Sarah Turnbull's ""Almost French."""
2,Disappointing,"I do admire Gershon for her desire to forge a new and adventurous life for herself after the death of her husband. At about the midway point in her book,Gershman writes ""Suddenly meals and social life were the most important parts of my day"". I hoped that she would perhaps find a meaningful purpose to her life by the end of the book; however, it seems that success for Gersham is self satisfaction. Shopping, eating and socializing are appropriate pasttimes, but when they become your life's purpose, alors c'est regrettable, non?"
1,a few hours I will never see again,"This book was terrible. I was hoping for something more like Mayle's books, or even something akin to Eat, Pray, Love (which I didn't find to be the greatest book either, but at least it wasn't as bad as C'est la Vie). The author name drops, sounds completely selfish, doesn't get the charm of Paris of the people, just that of her rich and well placed friends. It was simply this friend blah, that friend blah, my son boo-hoo, this market blah, my rented apt blah. She also complains about money a lot, but always seems to afford the finer things in life. And really, plan on spending a year in Paris and you rent an unfurnished apartment??? What an idiot. Not a single redemptive quality, except it makes great worm food in the compost pile. I would never, ever gift this book to a friend."
4,A good classic shoe,"This shoe gets me compliments almost every time I wear it. While looking quite nice the toe does tend to pinch after spending over five hours in them. Nevertheless, an excellent buy!"
1,Disappointed,"These tee shirts were irregular. They came in an authenticpackage, but when I held one up I noticed the side seams weresewn at an angle. Extremely disappointed."
3,Great set,We really like this set. It's stylish yet durable enough for use by young children. My only complaint is that the mugs are not made of the same material and we already have one that's chipped! The plates and bowls are fantastic though. The bowls are just the right size. I would highly recommend this set.
4,very practical,We received the original product with the handle of one of mugs broken. Amazon staff was very nice and they sent a replacement. Very Modern looking and very practical plates. The bowls could be little smaller.
4,Corelle dishes,I bought these as a Christmas present for my grandaughter who is moving into an apartment. She picked out the pattern herself. They arrived safely and quickly. She was well pleased with the dishes.
5,100% Satisfied,"I oredered two sets of these. They arrived today without breaking during shipping and without any pattern defects. I hope these last as long as my mom's corelle dishes that she's had for almost three decades! (Regarding thickness, they seem to be the same as my mom's, but don't quote me on that)"
3,Some Defects,"I like the style and colors of these dishes. I did have some trouble with defects and damage during shipping. I ordered 2 sets and had to make one ""good"" set then send the other back. Cups were broken and glaze was bubbled on several plates. The 3rd set that I ordered was in good condition, however, after stacking all the plates I realized that some were warped or wavy. I decided to keep them because I didn't want the hastle of receiving another even more defective set. Nothing against Amazon, these were all manufacturing defects for the most part and poor packaging inside the actual product box. Amazon is really good about the return of defective merch. so it was not such a big deal."
4,Gorgeous set!,"This set is gorgeous. The colors are fantastic and match my deco/retro kitchen perfectly. I love the ceramic mugs and hope they hold up as well as my Corelle glass ones did....I still use the Golden Butterflies from the last century!Why only 4 stars? Seems Corelle's quality control is not as stringent as it used to be. Each of the 3-sets I ordered, had a few imperfect pieces. Please do not hesitate to buy these wonderful dishes, however, inspect them carefully before throwing away the carton! Amazon is pretty good with returns. They pay for postage (if the return is due to defective merchandise) but make you send back the entire set for replacement/exchange. The set comes with a 3-year warrantee and the Corelle folks do stand behind their products! Hope this review was helpful and that you, too, will buy & enjoy this beautiful dinnerware."
1,"Corelle is great, of course, but the shipping is the worst","I attempted to get 3 sets of these dishes. Five sets later I still only have two sets because they kept arriving completely broken. The manufacturer packages the sets in boxes to be put out on shelves, not to be put into a larger box and thrown in the mail. Ridiculous waste of dishes and my time b/c Amazon made me go to the Post Office to return them! Return shipping was free, but still."
2,Kind of works but not very well,For 2 to 3 sheets they hold for minor reviewing but not for long and certinally not all the well. Not easy to use and no instructions. Don't corner staple as you will just tear the paper.
3,A Children's Book,"Don't get fooled or make an error in judgement. This is strictly a children's book, aimed at young adolescent readers. For what it is, it's good. Fran Striker wrote it and it has his style, but it is not part of the original series on the ole Masked Man.Anybody who wants this can have it...just pay the postage...Not a criticism of the book, just a fact that it is not part of the series I'm looking for...Hi-Yo Silver...Away!!!"
1,Defectvie DVD,"I was shipped a defective DVD. I bought it as a gift for my Wife's birthday and she can't even watch 5 minutes of it. The picture freezes, and I can't return it since its passed the 30 day window.I am terribly disappointed! Should have given the money to the SPCA instead."
3,oversized,"This is a very large mask (overall proportions), but the eye and nose slots/windows are made for a smaller face or kid. Looks oddly large on kids and not quite right for an adult face. The colors are great and really not a horrible buy when you consider the cost."
1,Why can't we rate certain things ZERO stars?!,"Why can't we rate certain things ZERO stars?! That's how many stars I would give to say... getting hot needles shoved into my eyes injecting lemon/jalapeño juice!!! I wanted this to be funny so badly! I remember seeing his very early work, and I remembered it being funny! Even in an altered state of consciousness, this special is a complete opposite of comedy! the only funny parts are him describing things that are already funny!!!!!!"
4,It's funny - people need to GET IT,"Those who can't see he is actually MAKING FUN of shock comedy missed the whole point. He laughs at himself, he admits it's crude - hence it's hilarious. Oy, you people."
1,"Bob, your publicist aren't even believable","There is no way that every 5 star review here wasn't written by his publicist. Nobody in this world would really think this is funny. Good try guys, but he's the worst I've ever seen. The brain cannot comprehend that anyone on earth would broadcast this, let alone put it out on DVD. Did they watch it before they released it. I don't think so."
1,I agree with previous review...,"I have seen Bob Saget perform stand-up prior to the whole Full House/AFV phenomenon, and he was off-color, but really funny. To me, in this special, however, it seemed as though he was just trying to shake the image by using every expletive, and anti-""Full House"" reference he could come up with. I think it was overkill, personally. Felt a little forced if you ask me. Not that anyone's asking me, mind you...."
1,Booooooo!,"I was kind of looking forward to this after his shockingly funny turn in the Aristocrats. My husband and I turned it off after 10 minutes. One of the most unfunny things I've ever seen. We were both amazed it made it on to HBO which usually has much higher standards. He uses the F word so much that it loses any and all shock value. I kept thinking that he was that nerdy kid in highschool who decides to ""become cool"" and practices cursing and posing in front of a mirror. PAINFUL to watch."
1,Garbage,If i could have given this zero stars i would have. And for anyone giving it more than one star saying it was funny you know nothing about comedy. Saget obviously going for shock value by cursing every other word totally misses that cursing doesnt make ANY comedian funny. Telling actual jokes makes them funny. He proved that he didn't work the clubs AT ALL and all his material sounded like it was made up on the spot. It was incredibly painful to watch and i felt amlost sorry for him that he really isn't funny at all and sorry for HBO that they paid him for that hour of garbage.
5,Bob.,bob saget is a classic. He's hilarious and just might be the devil. This DVD is a great purchase for anyone who likes bob.
5,"Last for days, as all cell phones should","I had my LG phone for about four months when the battery became useless. It wouldn't hold a charge for even a day. I don't spend much time on the phone, an hour/day tops. I expect to get a few days out of a battery. Picked up this batttery, lasts for days without a problem. It does take longer to charge due to its increased capacity."
1,"Don't waste your money, unless you only love Country","Did not meet my expectations! If samples were available for listening, I would never have bought this album."
5,"Witty, funny, enjoyable","Okay, it's not grammy material, but for a get together or golf outing it's great. Ayre's voice is perfect for this type of music. Amazon doesn't have clips from this CD, but you can hear some on the site [...]. I still listen to it 3 years after I purchased it."
1,"Like a Toy, Get a French Press, works much better for tea!","Yeah so I got this and its a piece of junk. It probably costs them about $3.00 to make these in China and then they sell them for $40, crazy. It's more like a decorative piece than a functional teapot. The bamboo board and scoop things are a joke, slippery as hell so you don't really want to set anything on the bamboo thing. The scoop is pointless, just use a spoon.If you want something 10 times more useful and less expensive just get a French press, it functions much better and can hold more liquid. This thing is tiny. Really, you can get a nice french press for $20 on here. Works waaaay better and you can make coffee or tea with it."
5,this is one awesome teapot,This is one awesome teapot! I have one and I gave one to my dad for his birthday. The little spoon comes in handy to measure how much tea you want to brew. You can see when the tea is brewed to your taste thanks to the glass! Easy to clean. I recommend.
1,"Serkin at his foot-stomping, insensitive worst","I can't believe that this brash, insensitive reading - esp of the 3rd - was named an essential recording. Kovacevich, Fleischer, Gilels, Kempff, Perahia, and Brendel are but a few with far superior recordings of these magnificent concertos available."
3,Just Okay,These lamps look nice but the quality is just okay. The shade on the one came damaged but everything was packaged so tight that it wasn't even worth sending back. I tried purchasing another shade but its such a unique shade no store had them.
5,Value Pack Switch Guard (Light Switch Guard),This is a great product although it is extremely hard to find. The most convenient aspect of it that is hard to tell from the illustration is the light toggle switch it covers is accessible from the side with your finger. There is nothing to remove to activate the switch. It's mostly to prevent accidental tripping of a light or toggle type switch. It's really practical over a garbage disposal switch that is in the open. It makes you think before you throw the switch (to check for utensils in the drain or if someone else is using the sink or clearing out the disposal drain). The one I bought is an ACE Hardware branded product and I'm surprised that more ACE hardware stores don't stock it; none in my area did.
3,switch guard,Does the job. Space on side is functional but not so attractive if decor is a priority. Excellent service from provider.
4,COMMUNION - A DEEPER LOOK,"I have read Commmunion and seen the film with the same title half a dozen times now over the years. We all know the story about Whitley Streiber and his family. He claims to be abducted by ""Visitors"" in and around 1985 from his cabin in New York State.Encounters of the Fourth Kind is pretty much a panel of ""experts"" discussing UFO's and abductions and the ""The Making of Communion.""This was released on VHS many years ago. It is now available on a DVD-R. Quality is decent. Some interesting material is covered.If you are into UFO's, Alien Abductions, Sci-Fi you may want to order this.AaronF"
3,Infomercial for the film Communion,"An infomercial-style panel-discussion of the film Communion in a ""community access""-looking tv studio (hosted by Planet of the Apes' actor Roddy MacDowell, who also voiced the audiobook edition of Communion), and brief interviews with author Whitley Strieber, his friends and family at the New York countryside cabin made famous by the original book. On the panel, watch for ""Report on Communion"" author Ed Conroy - or just buy his book since it is more informative (and be spared the sight of shoulder pads and 80s hair!)."
4,Enjoyable and Entertaining,A lot of hard work and research on various religions went into this book and that information is woven into a compelling plot. The story-telling is very good and and I was pulled into another time and place and was kept interested throughout.
5,"A Wonderful, Enlightening Journey","This book was one I couldn't put down. Not only was it entertaining, it was educational in a ""non-lecturing"" way. It introduces the concepts and fundamentals of many religious beliefs and reminds us that many of the world's religions are more similar than we think. The authors obviously have a passion for their topic and thankfully shared their passion with us. I highly recommend this great book!"
5,A one-of-a-kind (almost) collection,"Anyone who loves Bernstein's theater music has probably owned this CD or its LP equivalent for decades. The sonics are still great--the huge, lush sound that Cloumbia favored for the NY Phil. in Manhattan Center. David Hurwitz is silly to say that Bernstein's music has had ""a problem"" because he conducted it so well. There's no problem, but it's undeniable that LB was his own ideal conductor. Recently Carl Davis, an experienced film conductor, has led the Royal Phil. of London in the same program we have here. The sound is updated somewhat, and the price is ultra-bargain. So for the first time in forty years one can say that LB has a close rival in the West Side Story suite."
2,ok dj'ing but not for buckethead fans,if you're a buckethead lover this is not the place to go - the dj'ing is ok but buck's contribution is minimal - better to get one of the giant robot cd's or some praxis
2,"Great Idea, Lazy Writing","Being an avid Hollywood historian, I was eager to get this book about the history of Hollywood. While the writing is fast paced, and the author has a keen interest in history, I cannot stop finding mistakes that make me question the writer's committment to research: Fatty Arbuckle, for instance, was involved in a scandal at the St. Francis Hotel, not the Palace Hotel in San Francisco as reported here (and EVERY biography of Arbuckle mentions the St. Francis). The Alhambra (in the Valentino part) is in Granada, not Seville, Spain. Most historians believe William Desmond Taylor was gay, not ""romancing both Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Mintner at the same time"". Not to mention numerous typos that any self-respecting editor would have caught. This turns me off."
2,you've heard this one before,"I hate to be cranky, but this is a rehash of creaky gossip in an attractive package. No original research going on here at all. If nobody's ever told you what 'Rosebud' really refers to, or that Valentino's grave was visited by a ""mysterious lady in black"" (gosh), this might be a good intro for you. Otherwise, if you'd rather not skate on the surface, may I point you elsewhere? Would that be okay? For LA architectural history, try Charles Moore's brilliant & reprinted ""City Observed"". For the sleaze, go with the font, Kenneth Anger. For an in-depth look at H'wood in the teens and 20's, I'd try Kevin Brownlow's ""Parade's Gone By."""
1,My interest diminished,"Yes, this book does have a few good stories to tell, but I was truly upset by the book's summary as it was usurped from the Museum of Neon Art's neon tours of Los Angeles. Almost word for word, Wallace has taken the Los Angeles history lesson of the tour's guide and used it for himself without citation or proper credit. This fact has diminished the value and integrity of the book and I cannot recommend it."
2,"Inaccurate, hackneyed..","A fascinating subject deserves an intelligent and lucid treatment, but this book does not deliver. The photos' captions are frequently inaccurate. That isn't Zazu Pitts, it's Mabel Normand, by the way. Don't go by anything really that the text may tell you. It reads like it was hastily cobbled together after a few afternoons googling Wikipedia entries. This is a little book full of the same old, same old. For anyone seriously interested in the archeology of lost Hollywood this isn't much of a find, certainly it digs up nothing new. Lazy and lousy research."
1,Riddled with errors,"I got this from the library and started flipping around last week. I've maybe read a total of 10 pages skattered throughout the book. But just about every page had at least one factual error on it.Reading about hollywood history is a hobby of mine. I'm by no means a professional historian. But even I know that DW Griffith did not direct Greed and that Elvis Presley did not write Heartbreak Hotel himself. As has been already commented on, William Desmond Taylor was almost certainly gay, definitely not having an affair with Mary Miles Minter and at best casually dating Mabel Normand.This book tries hard to be like the superior Hollywood Babylon (HB also has a lot of errors but it was written in the 50's when fact-checking would have been more difficult. In the internet era, mistakes like the ones here are inexcusable)."
4,Raises fascinating questions about love,"This is a marvelous work of research on a society with fundamentally alternative traditions of family and sexual life. Cai Hua's study of Na culture (otherwise called the Moso) raises universal questions for our assumptions about love, marriage, and community.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"
2,truly disappointed,"I recently began working in a pediatric ICU. Although I had 9 years of pedi experience as a floor nurse, I knew I would need a solid reference to help in my transition to the many new procedures and medications I would need to learn. After obtaining this book, I was disappointed by what little it had to offer. I searched for some information on some very basic critical care issues (i.e. CVP) and found it woefully lacking. My only assumption is this text is written with the understanding that you own the larger more detailed book. If you are new to the critical enviroment and need basic, clear information, you may be better served with the larger more informative text. As for me, I will continue to refer to my old general pedi text, which currently is a better source."
5,Amazing!,"I love Resurrection Band's albums from ""Awaiting Your Reply"" to ""DMZ"". I would say that this is maybe the best one. There are lots of great riffs and no ballads at all. My favorite tracks are ""N.Y.C."", ""Colours"", and ""The Struggle""."
5,Great old school Christian Rock,"Without a doubt, one of the best Christian rock albums of all time...searing vocals, guitar solos and more..."
4,Great Training Material,"This is great book from China on the subject of acupuncture and the healing of disease, very useful and help full for any serious martial artist who seeks this knowledge."
5,"Finally, proof there is a God!-- Literally","This book explains how we as humans nave not been using our full potential when making love. This is not a sex manual by any means, although we will have a better understanding of what love is. Your partner will thank you only after you thank yourself. A must read for every man and woman."
1,Incomplete information and a lot of fill,"The author goes to great lengths to market this volume as the definitive word on the subject. However at least 25% of this book is self promotional and aimed at marketing the author's other books. In particular, regarding beathing techniques that are advertised as part of this book are simply mentioned and the reader is encouraged to purchase this other books to get the detail. This man is a fraud."
3,You must read Awaken Healing Energy Through Tao as well,"He's done it again. In Taoist Ways to Transform Stress into Vitality as well as in this book, Mantak forgets the extremely important collection of energy at the navel after doing the microcosmic orbit. In both books, he summarizes the orbit sloppily, as if all that is needed is to let the energy flow from the eyes, down the body and up to the head. If the energy is not collected at the navel, it can damage your mind or your organs. If anyone wants to do the microcosmic orbit, read the book devoted to it: Awaken Healing Energy Through Tao, which describes the dangers and the precautions and lots more. It's a minor investment that can save you lots of trouble."
3,A Day in the Life of Canada,"If you can buy it right, second hand, go ahead, but new it's overpriced for what you get."
1,Gay sex tourists whine about Arab men,"Along with the heavy-handed attacks by Arno Schmitt of Charles Pellat's work reprinted herein and of John Boswell, are a number of superficial accounts by 1970s gay sex tourists disappointed that the Arabs they let f*** them didn't treat them well. Except for an interesting chapter on ""not-so-gay life in Karachi"" and a survey of laws in Muslim societies, the books is mostly about Arabs (with some uninformative chapters on Turks and Persians). In contrast _Islamic Homosexualities_ by Murray & Roscoe (NYU, 1997) has greater geographical, cultural, and historical scope, less animus for scholars such as Pellat, and none of the tedious whining of disappointed European and American sex tourists."
1,This must be a joke!!,"To say that Islam tolerates Homosexuality is a very humorous claim indeed. This author focuses on practices done by corrupt muslims who do not even read their own book. The Quran numerously talks about Homosexuality, Condeming it over and over. First it warns the men not to leave their wives and go for other men. Another verse states How God dealt a destructive Force (severe storms) on the People of ""Lot"" that instantly killed all their inhabitants as punishment for such a sinful act. Then there are the VAST testimonies of Homosexual muslim who choose not to engage in Homosexual acts and lead a Heterosexual life in order not to Sin in the name of God. I could go on, this is so pathetic that it's not even worth my time reviewing this. MY ADVICE, BEFORE YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING SOMEONE SAYS OR WRITES ABOUT, do your own independant research to see if the author is honest or just a fanatic. In this cas go read what the Quran really says about homosexuals."
2,Can I get my money back,"Great selection of music but poor technical quality on the CD.Sounds ""muddy"" compared to other CDs. Some of the tracks do appear on other CDs I own so I have basis for comparison.Don't know if problem is in the ""mike-ing"" and mixing on original material or in the conversion to CD format.I'd like to return this CD for refund"
3,Not the best but a good one,"This CD is not the best one but it is an honest one. It contains the best-known marches that have been recorded between 1967 and 1976. The orchestration is good, the choice of marches is good too. I have heard better performances but it does not mean that this CD is not good. It is an honest CD and if it is the first CD of marches that you buy, it is a good choice. There are so many CD of marches that I have only one thing to say : listen different CD and choose the one that will please you. You buy a CD for you; not for the rest of the World."
2,disappointment,I love SCM and this cd sounded nothing like the band I knew. This was a big disappointment; I taded it immediately.
5,Post-Soviet Eastern Europe Accurately Described,"When I was in college, I was required to read this book. I was struck then by the insights that Tismaneanu had. This text gave me the greatest understanding of why Bulgaria kept the communists while the Czech Republic has put its arms around a market economy. Recently, I went back a re-read this book, and was struck at how timely the analysis still is. I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone looking to understand what has and will occur in Eastern Europe."
2,I just couldn't get intrested,"I truelly tried to finish this book but I have to admit I only was able to force myself to read 2/3rds of it. The book just seemed to flail with to many characters and not enough depth to any of them to make me want to even guess ""who done it"". I gave 2 stars as the benefit of the doubt. One I could not finish it so maybe the ending was great and I will never know (trust me, I won't loose any sleep over it) and second, this was the first Aird book I have read with this detective so maybe people that have already met some of the characters in previous books will be able to follow it better then me."
3,FOUNDER YES. FATHER NO,"THE FATHER OF ROCK AND ROLL IS BILL HALEY. EVEN IF YOU SAY NO TO THAT YOU HAVE LES PAUL AND I COULD NAME 20 MORE BLACK AND WHITE ROCK AND ROLLERS THAT CAME FIRST. CHUCK BERRY HAS A DISTINCT STYLE. IS A LEGEND. IS A EARLY FOUNDER. BESIDES ELVIS MAYBE THE MOST TALENTED OF THE EARLY PIONEERS (FATS ALSO GREAT). I JUST HAVE PROBLEMS IN CALLING HIM THE FATHER WHEN HE STARTED IN 1955. AND FATS, RICHARD, PERKINS, ELVIS, BO DIDDLEY WERE AROUND IN THE 1953-54 PERIOD. AND HALEY 1950. DON'T FORGET JACKIE BRENSTON ROCKET 88 1951. BERRY ROCK AND ROLL GOD?????? PERHAPS. GREAT PERFORMER, WRITER ETC. YES - BUT NOT THE FATHER."
5,FFC XV - Fight Card,"Chris Wilson vs. Dave GarciaJosh Haynes vs. Seth KleinbeckMatt Wiman vs. Roger HuertaForrest Petz vs. Josh NeerJason Lambert vs. Travis WiuffCarlo Prater vs. Keith WisniewskiDavid Gardner vs. Ryan SchultzLots of well known fighters on this card, plus the must-see fight between Matt Wiman and Roger Huerta make this a must own for any MMA fan."
4,Great Fights!,If your a MMA (Mixed Martial Arts Fan) then you will need to add this to your collestion!There are some asome fights on this DVD!
3,"Handy, but limited","This is a small (120 pages, about 6 inches by 6 inches) book about Marcel Duchamp. It's a overview of his career, with probably 40 or 50 plates. Almost all of the plates are black and white.The accompanying text is well written and clear. In fact, the text is probably more worthwhile than are the images. If you have a chance to get a large coffee table book of Duchamp's art, do that. The images in this book are simply too small to be of much use. However, the explication of the artist's career is interesting and worth reading.Duchamp was one of the most interesting and pivotal figures in early 20th century art. This book is a good introduction. This book is best supplemented by a coffee-table Duchamp book. However, the analysis is astute and concise. It's not difficult to read, and it makes for a decent introduction to the artist.ken32"
3,Product title misleading,"Although the title of the product states ""Walls of the Wild Grunt 2 Large"", there is only one fish sticker included in the package."
5,Amazing!!,"I bought this game on march 1 and i beat it today!! So i can give a full review...This game has the most innovative squad control system ever used or even made, I was able to control my squad by pointing my reticle then holding the A button and pressing a key on tthe directional pad. It is sooooOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo simple! Full Spectrum warrior tried to integrate something likke this but not as effective as Republic Commando. The story overall should be like a movie although the ending is somewhat dissapointing. all in all this was one of the best Star Wars games out there I highly reccomend it if you liked Halo 2."
5,commando,i got this game based on the computer demo. its great gameplay was big and the game is so rare nowadays.
4,A fun ride through the Star Wars universe,"I had a good time playing this game. It took me about two months to get through. When you consider I only play x-box about an hour a day, that isn't too bad. It took me about about two weeks to get across the bridge on the Wookie home world. I must recommend obtaining the play guide or you'll pull your hair out in certain sections. Graphics are stunning. Some of the other Star Wars games (like ""Knights of the Old Republic"" or ""Star Wars Battlefront"") have great replay value. That is really the only down side to Republic Commando. I will never play through it again."
5,just like halo 2,This game rocks!!!! trust me when play this game you'll be blown away. This game is practicly like halo 2 only you decide what your troops do. by far the graphix are awsome and so they are so good you acctuly feel like your inside of the commanders armor. One of the features i also liked about the game was when you've been shot down you can order one of your troops to heal you.
4,best star wars yet,it is so much fun i beat it in one day becuase I played all day it gets very hard if you are 6 or yonger do not play or you would cry ok little kids
3,50$?,"After I played this game for about 5 hours,I said ""I paid 50$ for this?""Sure,it's fun but then again it takes about 100 rounds to destroy a Super Battle Droid.The only way I could kill one was running up to it and sticking my knife threw it.Don't waste your time on this.They expect you to take out a huge Spider Droid without any grenades or armor piercing guns.My squad was a bunch of cowards I had a Super Battle Droid cornered and my squad couldn't finish it off.They expect you to take out 100 droids in 2 minutes.Don't waste your time on this."
1,Please wake me up... I fell asleep,"This game was cool through the first level, but every level after that was almost identical. The weapons set seamed very weak, I felt like I was shooting a pea shooter the whole game. I also spent way too much time ""Retrieving Bacta"" (health for the squad) this game really seams two years behind in game play and definitely didn't live up to the hype. The squad control was OK but there is very little strategy when commanding them. The blue highlights around Snipe or Anti-Armor locations scream put a guy here, again eliminating any strategy. Buy the way ""XBOX Live"" game play is horrible, I will be trading this game in tomorrow."
4,"Great Concept, just short","Being a die hard SW gamer I was really interested in seeing a SW game that did not rely on Jedi powers or key characters. In this game you are the team leader of Delta Force, your character is voiced by the same actor who played good old Jango Fett.The game itself is visually fantastic and realistic. The movement and A.I. are great as well. The game kind of combines the elements of Halo into the SW universe.The only down side was the the lenght. I finished the game in about 13 hrs, that was single player mode. I did not play online.This game seems to be built specifically for online play. I am sure it would shine.All in all, its a geat game, just short, unless you play online or in sync with friends, I suggest renting first."
4,Wall-to-wall butt-kicking!,"Is it the best game of the year? Nope. I think Mercenaries is decidedly superior. But is it the most fun game so far in 2005? You betcha!No classy cutscenes or lengthy narration. You're just thrown into battle from the get-go, learning the rules the hard way as you obliterate every enemy in sight. You get a lovely selection of weapons to choose from. And you get the best squad AI I've yet seen in a game. You really can order your boys into position, then lay for the enemy and give 'em a taste of hell.The battles are ferocious and sometimes seem unwinnable till you learn how to use your squaddies properly. It gets so that properly deploying your team is as much fun as wasting Trandoshan mercenaries.I like this game. A lot."
3,"Not bad, not great","Well, i was excited about this game coming out being a loyal starwars gamer and movie fan. I was disapointed. This game is unrully hard at times and extremely easy at others. A good side is that you can't really die because your squad can revive you.There are some cool points to this game:Great graphics, almost seems realGet to control a squadron of specialty clones, which you can tell them to do dif. things(snipe, commence door breach manuveur, etc.)Downside:Crummy two-player gaming, just plain stupidIntensly frustrating at timesGets boringWell it may have some downsides, this game is o.k and is a great game for starwars fans."
5,awesome!,well i've played this game for a while and i recomend you get it. Except the graphics are cheesy at some parts but the game play is awesome.
5,LOVE IT!,This pillow is amazing! I love it. It makes sleeping so much more comfortable. No temptation to roll over on my stomach anymore! I put the J end at my feet and use my original pillow for my head.I would recommend this pillow in a heartbeat!(This is the only online review I have done. Thought it was that important that I share . . .):)
2,Didn't like it...,"The idea is good, but I found that the pillow was way too poofy! I prefered my set up of 3 normal pillows to this body pillow. Returned it after only a few days."
2,Wish I had chosen a different one,"I am tall and this pillow is not long enough for me to use as it was intended. So I flipped it around and put the curved end between my legs, but it was annoying to have that big end sticking out and made it harder to flip over. The curved shape made it a pain to put the pillowcase on. Also, it was not as firm as I would have liked. It was better than nothing while I was pregnant, but I am sure I could have found something better. My massage therapist had one I liked that she bought on Amazon for less money."
4,Great...only one problem,"I love this pillow. I could not say that enough. I have had it about 4 months. I still have 2 months of pregnancy to go through. The pillow stuffing has become awkward. Where your legs wrap around the pillow, the stuffing shifts so much that there is hardly any there anymore where I most need it! It is a pricey pillow for that to happen after 4 months. Originally it was great, now I just wrestle with it every night to get comfy."
3,Helped for a while...,"When I first got this pillow mid-pregancy, it helped tremendously to keep me from rolling onto my back - though my husband hated how much space it consumed in the middle of our queen-sized bed. I used it for a couple of months with increasing lower back and hip pain up until spending a couple of nights without it while traveling. To my surprise, I slept better without it! For the next month or so, a regular pillow under my belly worked well, but I'm now happily using the Boppy Pregnancy Wedge Cushion. It's relieved much of my lower back pain and only cost $15."
4,"pretty good, not disappointed, it is what I expected","pretty good, I am not disappointed, it is what I expected. A bit pricey, but comfortable. I would recommend this product."
3,great pillow but i ordered 3. 1 came in a nice zipper plastic case with a pillow case and the other two came with no pillow case,great pillow but i ordered 3. 1 came in a nice zipper plastic case with a pillow case and the other two came with no pillow case and was just wrapped in shipment.
4,helpful pillow,"I bought this pillow when I was 28 weeks pregnant - it has been helpful since it keeps me lying on my side and I like that there are a lot of different ways to position it. My back pain has improved a lot. It is big, though, and takes up a lot of room in the bed. Putting on the pillowcase is quite a task- my husband and I wrestled with it for half an hour! Overall, I would recommend it- I think I will definitely use it for future pregnancies and my husband has his eye on it for after the baby is born- he loves to sleep holding pillows and I'm sure he will love using the snoozer once I am done with it."
3,You can save money and still sleep comfortably.,"I considered buying one of these pillows. But decided against it when the maternity/baby store did not carry them, so I found an alternative. Remember the wheat husk filled pillows (Sobakawa, Mount Fuji)? I have used those for years and had an extra pillow my husband never wanted to try. I got that pillow and used it as support for my belly. It works better than any body pillow because it is small, it can move with you to the left or right. The wheat husk make it easy for the pillow to form and support. It does not take up a lot of room. And when you travel, it can fit in your bag....I will sware by this pillow, not just for maternity reasons, but head and neck also."
5,Fantastic pillow,"I'm 20 weeks pregnant & just received the pillow less than a week ago & already am addicted. The pillow & pillowcase are both made from extremely high quality material -- both are so soft. I actually prefer my old pillow for under my head, but put the curved edge between my knees, & hug/snuggle the rest of the pillow -- it supports my stomach well, even now. I've also slept with the pillow behind me too, but I'm afraid my husband will steal it from me in the middle of the night. He really likes it, too, & I may end up having to buy him one also. I definitely recommend this pillow & my advise is: get it early!"
3,Nice product,"Good quality, it doesn't lose its shape. Perfect for those pregnant nights when you are aching. Even if you weren't expecting you wld love the comfort and shape of the pillow. My husband takes naps with it all the time!"
5,Oh My GOD!,The Best pillow I have ever owned. My husband keeps steeling it from me. I think he is jealous.
3,"Triple crown everlocking treat large, chicken flavor","My dog loves the actual treat, but it doesn't lock well at all. The long part does not easily twist into the treat's screw shapes. It does not easily go into the everlasting treat ball. If you just insert the ends in as you would an original everlasting treat ball and have the end sticking out, that will work, but it definately defeats the purpose of it being ""everlocking"". I would just stick to the original."
3,Everlasting Treat?,"After the recommendaton I had received for the toy these treats were made for, I had high hopes for it. Especially high hopes because I had recently purchased the Everlasting Treat Ball and expected the quality and texture to be as good and as durable as the cookie inserts for that toy. My pup managed within a few minutes, to chew off and eat the cookie rod end and remove and eat both cookies plus the cookie rod. The treats from the Everlasting Treat Ball last at least one week, but these didn't last one hour, so I was disappointed. These cookie inserts appear to be softer and easier to eat and finish than the Treat Ball inserts. I'll buy these inserts again, but will monitor his use of them. I had hoped they would be as durable and difficult to finish as the other toy, but they aren't. If my 6 month old beagle puppy was able to demolish these within an hour, I hate to think what an older, bigger dog could do with them! In my case, it should have been ""let the buyer beware"" !"
1,Snap goes the treat,"Just when I think I've found a treat to outsmart my lab she proves me wrong. It took her only 5 minutes to snap one end of the rod. She enjoys the treats, but it's just not worth the money."
4,Good treat,"My pup enjoys everlasting treats in or out of an everlasting treat ball. I decided to try the everlocking treat as something different, but it wasn't significantly different when used in the treat ball, and she ate the ends off the stick immediately. Overall they are treats she enjoys, but I will likely stick to the regular everlasting treats in the future (esp since she enjoys the various flavors)."
1,Dog treats,NOT recommended!!! Was advertised as long lasting. I bought the largest size and my small beagle ate it in ten minutes and she is ten years old. Plus it left a nasty stain.
2,"Dogs loved it, but it was anything but everlasting","I bought this at the recommendation of someone at the pet store, who said it kept her pittie entertained all day long. My corgi managed to chew off and eat both ends within 15 minutes, which makes this item a pretty pricey snack. So I guess it got the canine two paws up for taste, but I'll stick to bully sticks and other treats that last a little longer."
4,History is Made at Night,"This Brazilian import is a fine DVD. Picture is good, although not pristine; there are some dropouts, etc. Sound is also good. Although the print has not been restored, this is a fine print that should meet with satisfaction. There are no extras on the DVD. Charles Boyer and Jean Arthur work nicely together."
4,excellent but for a technical problem,"This is a rather unusual composition of old French tunes but fans of Frederica von Stade will love it. Anyone who likes mezzo soprano voices but doesn't know von Stade, the music is beautiful. After my original copy from 25 years ago was loaned and lost I went on the search for another. This missed ""I Love It"" because of a technical problem. I returned my first copy (the return process was totally painless) because it would not play in my home player, my car, or my computer. The second one will not read in my home system but does play in the car and the computer. Any other CD plays in my home system, even the ones I borrowed for testing. My player is old; it may be just fine with newer players. I decided to keep it. The music: 5 stars plus!"
4,Excellent but for CD presentation,"Frederica von Stade's voice and the balance of the orchestral accompaniment are first class. However, I enjoy knowing something of the composer's efforts, the origins of the songs, and the performer's relationship to the music, and was dismayed that the CD includes nothing - not even the composer's birth and death years! Further, as Amazon indicates, there are 21 songs included, but there are 23 tracks indicated because some idiot included the group labels, ""Chants D'auvergne, Vol. 1"" and ""Chants D'auvergne, Vol II"" as track numbers 1 and 16. You can figure out which song is playing by appropriate subtraction, e.g. the first song, Bailero, is listed as track 2 but is actually track 1, etc. Where are the standards?? Five stars but for this poor presentation of material."
3,An adequate rendition,"Von Stade's beautiful voice and the competent orchestral accomapniment make this recording worth owning especially for someone who can't get enough of these bewitching songs. However, von Stade's pronunciation of the Auvergnat language leaves much to be desired. More importantly, she fails to appreciate the romantic and pastoral themes of the music resulting in a lack luster performance which, at times, is almost boring. If you own only one recording, the old release by Netania Davrath is a must."
3,What a challenge!!!!,"Michael certainly took this one. His attempt to ""voice"" the Opera is not yet his, one would say ""Cup of Tea"". I'm sure his compassion for music and to share with others as he does all things influenced his decision to produce this CD. I hope in the future after studying voice or should I say ""Operatic Voice"" he will attempt another CD maybe with less difficulty. Michael is a talented singer with the heart, determination, and skills to succeed at anything. Keep up the good work. We look forward in hearing your next CD."
1,wow.....ive never heard something so bad....,This this...oh wow words dont describe it...its just horrible he makes Bocelli look like a real opera singer...
3,A truly sincere and worthwhile effort,"I feel very good about Michael Bolton's intentions in making this CD, and think it's a successful introduction to opera suitable for those fans of his who ordinarily wouldn't listen to opera.I am suprprise that nobody has mentioned the notes which are a great guide to those unfamiliar with opera. The dramatic background of each aria is given, with suitable illustrations, as well as the original lyrics & English translations.As opera, I can't give it any more than three stars, but as a serious, sincere effort to introduce the genre to his fans, I sure can't give it any less than three either.I urge Michael Bolton's fans to give this a try. It may take several times to become acclimated to this, but it's worth it. It is of course of much less interest to opera purists, although some may find it quite worthwhile as a curiosity, as an example of a pop singer seriously applying himself to these arias."
1,too awful,"It's bad enough that we have Andrea Bocelli playing at being an operatic tenor, now another pop singer has jumped on the bandwagon. It takes more than passion to sing this music; I have a passion for opera too, but I have enough respect for it (and myself)not to sing it outside the shower! In the hands of artists like Jose Carreras and Francisco Araiza, ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" is sublime. By Michael Bolton, it is awful beyond words. Now that Bocelli and Bolton have paved the way, what's next? Will Sarah Brightman treat us to her version of Mozart? How about favourite Puccini arias from Celine Dion?.Aaaaaggghhh, it isn't funny any more."
4,Give this one a try,I have never been an opera fan at all and I'm not a huge Michael Bolton fan; but my wife likes his pop albums and I've gone to a concert or two with her so I was curious when I saw this one. I think a previous reviewer suggested that this album might convince people who would have no interest in opera to give it a try and that's basically what it did for me. Bolton holds his own surprisingly well on some difficult arias (at least they sounded difficult to me) but what really sold me was the liner notes. Each piece has the background leading up to it and the english translation. I know opera snots say you don't need to know the translation but it helped me to appreciate the songs a bit more. That coupled with Bolton's surprisingly good vocals made this CD a worthwhile purchase and my favorite Michael Bolton CD.
5,MICHAEL BOLTON SECRET PASSION,"HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB. I WAS SO SURPRISED,I DID NOT THINK HE HADTHE VOICE FOR OPERA BUT HE NAILS THE SONGS. I LOVED THE CD AND PLAY IT ALL THE TIME IN MY CAR."
3,A courageous rock star tries something new,"Michael Bolton is no Domingo (or the other 2), but he's had great mentoring from Domingo and he tries very hard. Give him credit; how many rock stars would attempt this? His passion in the performances of very difficult pieces overrides his lack of a HUGE quality voice. Personally, I liked his renditions of LaBoheme, and if Renee Fleming had to give him a little assist, so be it. ""M'appari"" from Flotow's 'Martha' and Verdi's ""Celeste Aida"" were his best, and I hope he'll keep practicing and we'll hear more opera from him. His statement on the CD, ""I didn't realize that I would become so overwhelmed by the power of this great music..."" is a good enough reason for him to attempt this. How many other rock stars would have the guts (or a tenor voice with the capacilities) to do the same thing?"
1,OY VEY!,"Over thirty years ago, I thought that Enzo Stuarti was the begin-and-end all of ""bad"" tenors: now I hear a singer, who though he has an upper range (Che gelida) has NO BUSINESS SINGING THIS MUSIC!!! Ya know...Enzo sounds like Caruso next to this guy.....thanks for the humor...maybe next time he'll try lieder to really scare music lovers away...or Otello, or Tristan...I think I'll stock up on the earplugs now."
1,I am speechless... I am without speech...,"I am speechless. I am without speech. I only wish that Michael Bolton had been also, BEFORE recording this CD. It would have spared all of us a lot of grief and disbelief. A ""one-star"" rating for the singing on this CD is much too generous. I have enjoyed his other music, and can only hope that he sticks to what he does best."
1,Needs to spend more time studying voice,"Although Mr. Bolton has potential to become a decent tenor in the operatic style, I believe he needs a few years of studying voice to do these arias justice. They were written for singers with a highly trained voice and that is what is required to sing them correctly and bring out the beauty that lies in each of them. He sounds like a tenor with a very sore throat."
1,1 Star is too Much,Why did he try to sing these arias' when he can't even sing his dumb pop tunes. When I listen to the album I was embaressed for him!! His voice is full of so much tension and strain. Who the hell does he think he is???
1,The soul of Florence Foster Jenkins lives on.,"You know, had Meat Loaf tried to do this, it would have come off better.As it is, it's Florence Foster Jenkins all over again:The Glory (????) of the Human Voice"
5,Give the Man Credit!,"I for 1 love this album! Ok so hes not one of the. 3 tenors, but this man can SING!I give this wondrous voice credit for seeking out his hearts desire.You opera lovers are toned in to just certain singers. We all have our favs.If you fully enjoy listening to the baritone Voice of Michael Bolton and are not well educated in the opera sceneTo where you hear notes he may or may not hit,Then you might fully enjoy this variety and special CD."
3,"Passion,come out!","It's pleased to know Michael's love of opera in this cd.But it'snot easy for me to ENJOY it. It's true that love and passion can be expressed in many different ways, but I think they should be all expressed naturally and freely. How pity that something stopped Michael from doing well at it this time. Would he forget that he's singing opera?!! Would he remember he'ssinging his passion ?!! Yes,passion. Where is it in this cd..."
1,THIS RECORD IS A JOKE !!!,"Sorry, I can't take this CD seriously. At any rate, it's a joke. Please tell me when Pavarotti will release a rock and roll record... Anything is possible, isn't it ?"
3,Lots of Ideas Here,"This book has lots of ideas, some quite unique, for decorating your walls. Unfortunately some are so unique that they edge over into the weird territory. In Fong's case, this happens with:*the sticky note covered wall*the compact disk covered wall*a gray wall with a grid of yellow envelopes containing orange notes*stapling pages of a book in a scattered way on a wall to make it look like they blew there from a book on the tableMaybe some designers are trying too hard to be novel and to stand out from the crowd."
2,Not very useful for my home,"I ended up donating this book to the library book sale. The ideas were not practical for a ""regular"" house (and I have old wood floor painted bright red, so I am not totally traditional) and I am sorry I bought it without looking at it first."
5,WOW...Even I can do that!,"Walls That Wow is filled with fun projects and creative use of materials. I may not be able to complete a wall in 1 hour, like the book suggests, but I'll be having so much fun, who cares? My teenage daughter looked through the book -- she can't wait to cover her room with CDs!"
2,interesting but not WOW!,"Most of the ideas in this book would not stand up to the test of time- or a strong breeze! post-it notes on the wall?!? Jonathan, what were you thinking? Though I really like the ""envelopes with messages"" concept, the execution is a short term art project.Well worth a couple of bucks though, but I would have been very upset if I had paid full price for this."
3,Walls that Wow,"I was not as pleased as I had thought with this book. This information is basically ""covering a wall"" not with much more than that. I had hoped the book had wall treatments that I would keep as a sign of pride and professionalism and not just a covering. True one can use anything to cover a wall, but would I want to keep it for more than a week, no. I was disappointed in this book of his but I have enjoyed his other displays."
4,I kept the empty bottle.,The vacuum cap must come in handy someday. A light delicious lemon soda that is not as strong as the Italian version.
5,Heartfelt and at the end fulfilling !,"It is refreshing to read a gay love story, when love between same sex is not an issue but is accepted by parents and peers. The problem here is a real social problem about impact of child sexual abuse on one of the lovers and it is beautifully handled by the writer. Mandal is an expressive writer, dealing deeply into the emotions of the two protagonists as each struggle with his love towards the other. How does one cope when one's lover tells you he does care but does not love you... and this definitely provide some heart wrenching moments. The ending is most satisfying, with the last few chapters giving a sense of continuity to a relationship which the reader appreciates will stand the test of time. I hope Mandal's next novel is not too far away."
5,Air Horn,I was pleasently surprized at the loudness of this Air Horn. It is easy to operate and works perfectly and is a good item to own in an emergency or to get someones attention.The ordering process with Amazon.com is easy and the item is shipped and received as promised.Thank you.
2,"Loud, but mine was defective","I got two of these. One works fine, just don't try to over tighten the horn. It doesn't get very tight. The other was defective since the horn will not stay on the canister at all. It won't even get barely tight and just falls off. And it wasn't anything I did wrong. I read the instructions and used it just like the other. You have to hold the horn on, then after you sound it you're left with two pieces.And YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE TO AMAZON! They're deemed hazardous and you're not allowed to send them back. So, if you get a defective one like me, you're stuck with it.I wouldn't recommend this brand. And definitely don't purchase anything like this from Amazon. It was a rather expensive mistake for what the product is. Live and learn."
1,Terrible,This product came in an open package and was missing the Airhorn portion.I ordered this as a complete package and it came incomplete.The product also looked used and looked pretty old. Very disappointed in this.
4,Delbert over the years,"Great compilation of Delbert McClinton songs, exhibiting his many talents as singer, writer, harmonica artist & soulful musician."
4,"This book is NOT by the USGA, it is the ""Royal and Ancient""","The Editorial Reviews Product Description is wrong for this book. It is described ""Where better than an official publication of the United States Golf Association to learn the rules of golf?""Except that this book is the ""Royal and Ancient"" rules for golf *outside* North America (note the royal seal on the cover). It is not by the USGA at all and clearly states on the book that it is for European Rules (despite Tiger being on the cover, I don't know what's up with that).That said, it is a well presented and very good overview of golf rules, many of which I'm sure apply in the US. Just don't assume this is the USGA talking."
5,Hot Reading!,"Very enjoyable erotic romance. The plot is not extensive, but it works well with the shorter stories and the sex scenes are scorching with packed in emotion and characterization. I look forward to Ms. Copeland's next release."
2,Not Great,"I've been reading all the Aphrodisia books. There have been a few great ones, and a few that were decent. After Hours wasn't very engaging and I often wondered if there was any story at all to go along with all the love scenes. Neither the characters nor the plot had much depth. I probably won't buy from Jodi again."
2,Not so great video.,"The audio of all 4 concerts is excellent, but the video of the concerts played by Heidrun Holtman is below standard. The camera operators showed too much of the constantly moving head of the pianist with her loose hairs. This was annoying. They also did not show clearly the hands playing, the angle was poor. The other 2 concerts are good and up to standard."
3,A Title With A List That Ought To Go The Other Way Round,"At least that is the order of the performances.Heidrun Holtmann's performance is impressive. She sounds more Italian than German in her music making: she is somewhat like a mixture of Michelangeli and Backhaus, with a little bit more of the former than the latter.Kocsis is a little bit disappointing this time, not only is he a little bit too fast,he is not quite mercurial enough. His tone is somewhat coarse at times too. I like his Beethoven and Schubert much better. This was filmed, after all, some 15 years ago when he was relatively young then.The least impressive would be Andre Previn. The inclusion of so much jazz music into the cadenza is neither here nor there. Look at his hands on the keyboard, or else the facial expressions of the members of the orchestra and you can see why he is most objected to as one of the great pianists of the century. No wonder he found Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra unmanageable!"
2,Hold out for the new edition...,"This book is much too old (2001) and has almost nonexistent internet coverage. Hold off and buy the new, updated second edition of Moon Guatemala due out in September. It's written by a new author who is very familiar with Guatemala. See the link below:Moon Guatemala (Moon Handbooks)"
2,Get Another Book,"This book in a compilation of the authors' little acting stories. Some of the stories have some use, but most of which don't. I have done high school shows and a few community theater shows, and yet, still found little information I didn't already know. I'm sure there are other books out there that have more and better information, but hey, if you happen to have a collection of useless acting books, go ahead! Buy it!"
3,Find a school,"Interesting very, very, very basic approach to acting. Will give you the basic tools, then go and find a school.(...)"
2,What no mention of the great Olivier?,"Laurance Olivier was considered the finest actor of the 20th century and he doesn't appear to make it in here (he's certainly minus from the index). About what its says about overrated method acting giant Marlon Brando having the ability to speak clearly when his son was on trial and Marlon the witness stand the latter mumbled his speech as he did in most films. Maybe it took many outtakes to get MB to speak clearly for Julius Caesar as this book claimed he spoke clearly for that film. The book was way too weak, brief and easy on method acting techniques as they often call for actors to get really beaten on just for ""authenticity"". Shakespearean acting (as most English actors do) is preferable to method acting."
5,Terrific!,This book gives the reader an incite into the acting world never before offered. I highly recommend it to the beginning actor as well as the accomplished thespian. The helpful recommendations for auditioning will be of great value not only to the actor but to the casting directors and producers.
1,Don't waste your money,"We received this product and once we took it out of the box we noticed severe intentional scratches (in a checkerboard pattern) on the arm bracket. We overlooked this thinking that nobody would actually look at the bracket. Once we installed the showerhead to the arm bracket, it would not stay up. The arm bracket was so loose that there is almost no way you could shower under it without taking the showerhead down and holding it. In addition, this is an ALL plastic product (this is not stated in the product description). We spent a little more money on this product because we believed it was not plastic like some of the others. Overall, spend your money on a quality product, not this piece of junk!"
2,"ALL PLASTIC, CHEAP, POOR QUALITY ... BUT IT DOES WORK","OTHER REVIEW VERY ACCURATE BUT AT LEAST IT DOES WORK AND INSTALLED VERY VERY EASILY.THE 'HOSE' IS SUCH CHEAP THIN FLIMSY PLASTIC THAT THE BENDS AND THE KINKS FROM THE SHAPE IT WAS FORMED INTO TO FIT IN THE PACKAGE DOES NOT EVEN UNFOLD INTO A NORMAL HOSE. DEFORMED, UGLY ... BUT IT WORKS."
4,"very fun, but a few minor grudges","I downloaded the public beta for this game and enjoyed it very much. It was a great mix of CS and TFC. The only problem i have with it is that it is hard to tell who is on your team and who isnt. It is probly just because i was on a dark map, but it can get annoying. Other than that minor grudge, it is an awesome game and i would reccomend buying it if u liked CS or any other half life mod."
4,Global Ops Multiplayer,"I downloaded the public multiplayer demo and played it through SpyArcade and I love it. This is the first time that I did multiplayer and it was fun! Very addictive. The demo scenario was essentially capture the flag in 'Quebec' with a 'VIP' being the flag. The sides are a special ops unit versus 'terrorists.' You choose several roles (sniper, commando, medic, demolitions expert, machine gunner)and there are specific weapons asssigned to each role. However, you can use other players weapons when they die and leave them. I would buy this game!"
3,Get TACTICAL OPS instead of GLOBAL OPS,Dont be wasting your time with Global ops when u can play tactical ops.
1,THIS GAME [STINKS],"Save your money and do NOT buy this game. I love squad based first-person shooters, and I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this game. Download the public beta dome and give it a try before buying the full version. If you like the beta you'll like the full version, but let me warn you, the full version isn't any better than the beta demo."
1,Bad game,"I will never forgive myself for buying such a game. So many slowdown, lag, slow framerate in single player, yes, in single player game. Expect more lag in multiplayer game. Horrible graphic. No wonder they sell it below MSRP price.I dont understand why people made bad game, and how come people still buy it. I've been waiting for 1 year to play this game, but now, it just disapoint me..."
4,Global Ops Review,"This is a game not like many others - well in a way it is because it is a first person shooter game not unlike the legendary Half-Life. This game combines the new 3d engine that powers Half-Life, Quake3, and even the relatively new released Return To Castle Wolfenstein. I recommend this game for more than one reason, but the best is that if your a lover of non-fiction first-person shooter realism games like half-life or wolfenstein. You will thoroughly enjoy this game, it is definately one of my favorites. ENJOY-THE ELEVENTH"
4,Great...but not for soft cereals.,"I love this item, it looks great in my kitchen. Very sturdy! My only complaint is even though the rubber that turns inside to move the food is very soft it will still make a mess of cereals such as apple jacks. Looks awesome with coffee beans though!"
2,Not worth it...,"These dispensers were uncomfortable to re-fill and the material is not very good....It's easily breakable and the transparent containers turned dull, making it less attractive for your food items in the containers. I used it for less than 2 months..."
3,Very cool looking but smaller than I thought...,Looks great and great quality but not big enough for a regular size box of cereal. Works well though. Flakes do get a little crushed.
5,Best candy dispenser ever!,"We originally received one set as a gift from my sister, and realized it would be perfect in our theater room. Turns, out, one set wasn't enough and we now have two sets in the theater room, and one on the pantry door! The pantry one is used for cereal, however they are much better suited for candy, as the rubber ""flaps"" tend to crush/spit out cereal. The cups have measurements on them, as well as the storage containers. They come with ""freshness seals"" - though I usually don't have them on, as it's a bother removing them all of the time. Sturdy and easy install, would definitely recommend! (had them almost a year now, holding up strong)"
4,Great product for Candy,"I saw this product on Extreme Home Makeover Edition being used for candy dispensers. I thought this would be great for my snack bar in our family room. This product works great for this application!! It has a cool WOW factor and each unit has a small cup stuck to the bottom of each unit to capture the candy. The Kids love them too. Types of candy I hold in them are: Reeses Pieces, Mike and IKE's, M&M's etc.... I do not think that this product would be good for small products that crush easily but for Candy it rocks!"
3,Cereal Dispenser,"This product is very practical and was very useful. I used it primarily for my 6 year old to get her own snacks so for that it is perfect. One thing I must note, it is difficult to turn and dispense large pieces such as cheerios, apple jacks etc. but smaller snacks and things ok. Overall I like the product and would recommend."
3,Not so good product,"The product does not work very good. It works ok for coffee beans, rice and pasta noodles. It does not work so good with cereals. Also when you go to refill the individual containers they sometimes disconnect from the wall mount."
5,Kitchen storage food dispenser & container,"I am very happy with this product. Very handy for snacks, nuts, etc. Takes no counter space, is in plain view and is handy to use."
4,Looks Nice,"These are made of plastic but they are well designed/made. The turn wheel is rubber on the inside and helps the seal. They also come with top and bottom sealing lids, although the bottom doesn't feel like a good seal. You can also put the included measuring cups on the bottom which feel like a better seal. I would not recommend this for long term storage. I'm using mine for cereal and it works well with just a little crushing as you turn the wheel."
4,Cute and fun!,"Although his nose is easy to break off and you cannot position him to stand, this is a cute and fun gift for all ages!"
4,Product was as ordered.,"Product was as advertised and fit my whistles fine. White gets fast pretty quick though and that's a good thing, so you know when they're dirty and ready for replacement. I replace them about every six months."
2,NOT A 16 MONTH CALENDAR,The extra four months in this calendar (Sep-Dec) are all on one page. This doesn't give you enough room to write. I expected full pages just like the rest of the calendar.
1,Pastry cloth edges curl after washing,"The fabric on the pastry cloth is nice and thick, but the edges curl up when you wash it. You would have to iron it before you could roll anything out on it. AWFUL!"
5,"Great, even for a non-sports fan !","I am definitely NOT a sports fan, and never thought I'd watch ESPN. But with three granddaughters who play soccer, and with Women's World Cup Soccer 2011 promising to be the most competitive ever, I decided I needed to get on board and learn a bit about the history of women's involvement in the sport. That's why I purchased this DVD. And to my surprise, I loved every minute of it! I watched it twice, then gave it to my granddaughters to watch. Excellent, informative, entertaining. Dare to Dream tells an inspiring story with implications way beyond the sport of soccer."
5,Incredibly motivating for soccer girls,Great video--incredibly motivating for girls. My daughter loves it and watches it before soccer games/tournaments.
5,great movie for the whole family,I bought this movie for my two nieces (11 & 13) who play soccer. The whole family watched it and absolutely loved it. Very inspirational.
5,Vital for aspiring authors,"I read this and will keep as a reference book. Anyone who is hoping to break into the publishing world, particularly as an author, should read this. It's a wonderful insight into the busy life of an agent, but it also shows all the pitfalls to avoid when you are approaching an agent with your precious manuscript!"
3,A change of pace for Michael Bolton fans,"I own this CD and bought it because I'm a Michael Bolton fan. I saw him on the A&E show that takes requests. That's where I heard him explain the reason he recorded the CD, and the title. He loves to listen to opera, and ""My Secret Passion"" is how he feels about the music.The ""Terribly Horrible"" review was written in terms of professional classical skill and technique, and I respect that. However, if you're a fellow Michael Bolton fan, it's an interesting CD, and definitely different. It's relaxing, and is less intense than the usual love/blues songs for which he's famous. He recorded this because he wanted to and because he could."
1,"Michael Bolton, How Pretentious Can you Get?","What is UP with all these rockers trying to git all 'serious'? There's Paul McCartney and his crappy Liverpool Oratorio, there's Elvis Costello with his wimpy Midsummer's Night Ballet, and there's Michael Bolton singing like a dying horse with a lovely orchestral accompaniment. I can just picture the look on the cellists' faces as they accompany this schyster...What is the POINT? Ya can't pull it off, buddy, it doesn't matter how good your Italian diction is, ya can't sing opera."
3,Strictly a novelty,"A Groove Coverage remix(es) of Moonlight Shadow is a good track to drop in a club set for the newer generation of clubgoers. It's a catchy and danceable novelty track that usually keeps a crowd smiling & jumping, but will have sceneheads clutching their heads in horror because they remember the original by Mike Oldfield.If you want the full CD (""Covergirl""), the German arm of Amazon ... carries it.A previous review referenced ""God is a Girl"" - also a nice track. The CD-single has a semi-explicit cover, so parents of minors beware."
4,dude.. this is great,man... i have heard some music in my time.. but dude... THIS IS TOTALLY CRAZY!!
1,"There are covers, and then there are COVERS...","...and unfortunately, this one falls in the POOR group. Its no real fault of the artist, its just that this song (and practically any other by Mike Oldfield) just aren't coverable easily. Lets face it, Mike is one of the greatest musicians of this age, and attempting to emulate his ability and distinct sound is futile at best. Nice try, unfortunately it falls well short of being any good."
5,An Excellent Overview of Utah's Geologic Treasures.,"Utah's parks and monuments showcase some of the world's most spectacular geology and this book covers it all - every national park, monument, and recreation area; 10 state parks; the Sheep Creek Geological Area; the Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park; and the Paria Canyon - Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness Area.It is well written and illustrated, including abundant photographs, diagrams, maps, stratigrapic columns, and cross-sections. From the crusty old geologist to those with a passing curiosity about the rocks and landscape this book has something for everyone. Read it and you are likely to know more than the rangers!Reasonable priced for a book this size."
5,JAZZY PIE PLATE COLORED BRIGHT FOR FUN,"THIS IS a very durable pie plate, very heavy and has a good finish so it cleans easily. It has an edge all the way around it so its easy to lift out of the oven without dropping or spilling. You will probably have to increase the size of any pies you make in it because its REALLY DEEP. Its better than the usual pieplate. For one, its more attractive and colorful. So it cleans easily, is sturdy, easier to handle. Need I say more?"
3,Fun but hard,"I have had the game for a while but still haven't beaten it this game has 3 new creatures the chicken the rhino and the crocodile,these are just come of the creatures you can get soon you can get all the creatures not just some.I""ll say thought creature isle has got to be the best game ever.I've beaten black and white 5 times this game has challenge if somebody likes a challenge get this game For more advice got to these three sites:Bwgames.com,Planetblackandwhite.com,and Bwcenter.com good luck"
2,Beware!,"If we have the same troubles loading and playing this verison of B&W then you can forget me. That is forget ME/XP, good luck with support, anyone else memorized the 800#."
3,It's an good game,"Black & White: Creature Isle is a pretty good expansion for Black and White as long as you enjoy spending a lot of time with your creature. If you liked the struggle between gods element from the first, it does not carry over to this game."
5,Absolutely essential,"This book belongs on the reference shelf of anyone who is even remotely interested in military history. Most of the atlas is devoted to the American Civil War, but there is exhaustive coverage of the American Revolution and other US domestic and foreign excursions.The clearly drawn and excellently reproduced maps allow the reader to easily examine terrain features and to track troop movements - in some cases almost hour-by-hour. Ample commentary is also included beside each map which helps to put the events shown in historical perspective. It's a real pleasure to see this old friend in print again.In short, get this one if you don't have it already - it's well worth the money."
2,Interesting maps with text to be used very carefully,"The atlas has good maps for much, but not all, of its intended purpose. But the REAL drawback is the text. Many mistakes penned by John Elting---especially serious ones concerning various Civil War aspects---plague the text.In the end, it is an OK book for reference, but Elting's mistakes are too numerous to qualify it as The Bible."
1,"Sorry, This Is Not For Me","I'm glad Amazon had the 25 sample pages, for I looked through them and saw that this book is for someone studying war, perhaps like a cadet having that course, but it's certainly not your interesting coffee table book. It appears to be rather boring. Anyway, it's not for me, and I suspect, not for most people. Save your money."
1,"Good For Its Intended Purpose, But Not For Mine","This is more like a textbook on war. It's well done. And, I'm sure it is good for its intended purpose, but not for mine. I therefore made a mistake getting it. Just wanted you to know."

1,Mahler Symphony #2,"This is one of the most dissappointing renditions of Mahler's second symphony.Mahler is my favorite composer and I admire and respect Bernstein's love for Mahlers works,but this interpretation is mystifying.It is alternately too fast in parts and too slow in others.I have heardmany other versions by other conductors that are better,namely--B.Walter,G.Solti,Zubin Mehta,Clauddio Abbado etc.Don't buy this recording."
5,Music at it's best,"This is the best recording of Mahler's second symphony that I have ever heard. Being a trombone player who likes composers that use my instrument to it's fullest, I know Mahler's music very in-depth. Bernstein is such a wonderful musician, pouring himself into every composer that he performs. He is simply amazing. The quality of this recording is superb. The New York Phil sounds great, with a live and full sound. The whole Bernstein Century series is wonderful and full of desirable recordings of all of the standard repertoire. I highly recommend all of the Mahler recordings in this collection especially the third symphony."
2,A Good Idea with Poor Execution,"There are other books I could dislike more that this one, but I'm not thinking of them right now.The plot is mediocre at best. Ron runs away to the border between the real world and the fairy realms to live with a bunch of punk kids who are a mixed group of humans, elves, and half elves. In a matter of days he becomes deeply attached to them and is devastated when tragedy strikes. Even though this action takes up most of the book, it's not the main thrust of the plot - find that yourself if you can weed through the overwritten prose and unexceptional characterization to finally get to the story that's buried under this poser's depiction of punk.In general, I feel like this story and this setting could have been handled better in different hands. It had potential and instead it tanks."
1,Go Elsewhere to find a book,"Elsewhere is just as the title exclaims...GO elsewhere to find a book...I hated this book so...the characters were so fake. The monolouge was plain. She did this, he did that...me too!...yes...oh man, couldn't the author have made this more lyrical. Worst of all, some parts of the book didn't make sense, it lacked in outline and was mysteriously like reading two stories that didn't have a clue on what was to happen. Pretty dull read."
4,Well it's no shakespeare but...,"...I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Maybe it's my enjoyment of teen angst that did it. Shatterly made a pretty cool kid here, tough big mouth, little body...I did occasionaly get the feeling that the whole angry teenager(grr) thing was a bit over the top but there wasn't much that stuck out sorely (besides -some- character interactions)The end was little problematic. Be warned, the ending seems to have been written with the sequel Never Never in mind. I ended to book with the feeling that there was never a plot, just this place called the Bordertown and this kid called Ron who's learning about it as I am.That was good enough for me though. The world and the people were fantastic enough that I ignored the disregard for linear tale. Overall, it's just a fun read."
2,Are you a Baseball Junkie?,"I received this set as a gift. It has a lot of interesting audio clips from games of old that I found interesting, but the songs aren't worth squat. If you are looking for baseball songs, try Diamond Cuts, Baseball's Greatest Hits, or a Terry Cashman album. For those that love old baseball play-by-play and interviews it might still be worth it. Vincent Price's version of Casy at the Bat isn't bad either."
1,Barely worth the time to review,"I love baseball. I have several CD's of baseball music etc. This one is a complete waste. The first CD isn't too bad, but the music is simply covers of old songs and it doesn't work. I have listened to it once."
5,Bruce Springsteen,"I have not heard this product yet. This is a birthday gift to my husband,as he grew up with the ""Boss."" He was just Bruce back then trying to ""make it"" in the music world. Every chance he got, To the Stone Pony he and his friends would go because Bruce was there. How cool, talking to ""The Boss"" before he was the boss, he was just a regular person like me and you. You know what, HE STILL IS!!!!! Money did not change him. He still is Bruce. You go baby."
4,Nice set,My husband and I extensively researched the field before making the leap to HDTV. I looked at the reviews from Consumer Reports and He wanted a TV that he could plug his laptap into for programming and watching downloaded movies. This is a beautiful set that meets our needs.
4,No size?,"I havn't actualy gotten this item, however It would help if the size was given! The actual print is beautiful, though, and if I knew how big it was I would buy it in a heartbeat."
3,Good..ultimately unsatisfying,"A challenging book that raises a lot of serious questions. what if you could go back in time and alter one of the greatest atrocities of our history? It's a unique novel, and certainly a notch above most current sience fiction. But after developing some wonderful concepts and characters, I feel Dunn lets his characters (and readers) down in the last third of the novel. The conclusion is ultimately unsatisfying."
4,"A good book, but it doesn't skimp on the truth...","This book was a great read. However, as I said above, it doesn't skimp on the truth, and it's set in the Holocaust. I literally could not eat anything after reading it for at least 2 hours. I disagree with the review below that says this is an excellent book for ADULTS, because I am a 14 year old and still enjoyed the read. But, I don't recommend this for anyone who doesn't think they want to come face-to-face with the horrific events that occured during the Holocaust. People my age who are interested in the subject matter might find it enjoyable. I loaned it to a friend who absolutely hates sci-fi, and now she has her own copy. So, once again, it was a good book, but not a very happy one. Don't read it unless you're sure you can stomach the facts."
1,10X20 Pop-up is Garbage!,"I bought the 10X20 pop-up canopy. A friend and I finally got it up after struggling with the tight pop-up mechanism and one bar bent in the process. After it was all set-up, it started to rain and the roof was so cheap the water came right through!! It was dripping everywhere as well as collecting water in pools on the edges of the roof. It was a disaster and useless when it rains if you want to stay dry. Cheaply made as are all of these pop-up deals over 10x10. I also got a 10x15 tent that collapsed in a rain storm because the water collected on the roof and never drained off. The water weight bent one of th poles and it snapped.Stay away from Pop-ups unless your around all the time to monitor them when it rains or it's a very temporary structure."
2,Dont waste your time.,"Read the other two reviews its all true. Unless you are going to stay right with it, it is not very durable. It does go up quick but you must be very carefull because the inward works are very thin and bend easily. Like the product and will probably buy again but if you want something srong and durable this item is not for you."
1,Poor quality,I put the tent up for the 4th of July on the 3rd. By the morning of the 5th the tent was destroyed. Water had accumulated on the roof and collapsed the tent bending many of the supports inside. If parts could be had it could be fixed but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone. It actually went up fairly easily and I put it up by myself. It is just cheapley made. The metal construction needs to be much heavier.
3,tents,The speed the prechase was processed was very good and the delivery was also vert fast. The tents are easy to put up with two people but the bags they come in are to small and the zippers and not strong enough.
2,Not what I expected,"Overall, the product was in decent condition. some of the poles were bent a little. Biggest problem is the height of the entrance area. Cannot pull SUV under it for detailing. Company said that they would accept a return but, there would be a restocking fee and I would have to pay for the shipping as well. I can understand the shipping fees... have problem with restocking fee based on limited disclosure of dimensions before purchase. Guess its my fault for assuming."
4,Takes away much of the fear of the unknown.,"I am one who prefers many details on a subject,however,this book does provide good information and great references on WLSs. The beginning talks about challenges and feelings of the obese & morbidly obese. I thought ""So what. I already know."" But I had forgotten much of it. I have been obese for so long that I automatically avoid problem situations and had forgotten the joy and security I had prior to years of dieting.This book addresses the real issues around obesity and WLS without being negative yet doesn't whitewash it either. I feel much more confident now at the beginning of my WLS journey."
5,Easy to read and understand,"I had WLS in November 2000 and wish I'd had a simple book like Michelle's to help in all the technical jargon I was trying to read. She gave a good overview of the types of WLS surgery available in an easy to read format.That review from LThomas was a joke - what a misguided, irrational person she must be. Once again, Linda Thomas is using whatever methods she can to slander a good doctor's name.This book is NOT about what doctor to use. It is a book that describes what type of operations are available and a description of each.The only thing I would have liked is some before and after photos (we women LOVE before and after photos!).I say, ""Good job, Michelle!"""
3,Light weight (no pun intended),"Although interesting to read, this is definitely a light weight book and does not necessarily envoke deep thinking on the subject. But since there truly are very few published personal accounts of weight loss surgery, this is interesting to read."
4,Weight Loss Surgery,I found this book to be very factual and informative. Definiatly a must read for every obese person looking for an answer. She tells it in a way anyone can understand. I know it took alot of effort and reserch but She has done her homework. I'll be sure and buy it for several of my friends.
4,Excellent beginning book for those considering WLS,"This book starts at the beginning and goes through a lot of what you want to know about weight loss surgery. It's not a big book, and there are a few typos and ""dangling headings"" as someone else mentioned, but that's irrelevant. There is a lot of information on the web about weight loss surgery, but with this book you can sit in your easy chair and read, and also share it with family and close friends, many of whom will think you're nuts to consider the surgery, but most of whom will feel better after reading this book. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is either considering the surgery or who wants to know more about it, FIRST-HAND, for any reason."
2,"Good cover, terrible solar capabilities","It covers my pool well enough, but it does nothing to heat it up. I use to large black trash bags cut up and taped together and lay that on the water to heat up the pool with sun light. I would not buy again."
2,Question,We just got our pool cover 5 min ago and just put it on the pool.Question? Is it supposed to have perfect round holes every so often. About the size of a quarter?thank you
3,NOT was i was expecting!,"I was expecting a pool cover not just a ""lay on top of the pool / on top of the water"" kinda ""cover""! It sure works great to warm up the water pretty quickly but don't be fooled: it definitely is not a cover in the common sense of the word! It's more like a big sheet of bubble wrap! If i would have known that before i definitely would have NOT ordered this one!"
5,Worked fine all season long,"The cover fit very nicely inside our 12' pool. It was lightweight and easy to pull on and off the water. It has a few holes in it so it lays flat on the water without trapping any air bubbles. At the end of the summer, it still looked like new (after a quick wash). I'd recommend it to friends."
1,Cheap solar cover doesn't last,"We've had our solar cover for 1 year now. It is basically blue bubble wrap. It seemed to work well the first summer, but has fallen to pieces this summer and we finally threw it out because of all the small blue back sides of the bubbles that are constantly falling into the pool and clogging up the skimmer basket. I'd recommend purchasing one from a pool shop if you want it to last."
2,doesn't last,We've had this solar cover for about a month and a half...all of the little solar bubbles are completely deflated and serves no purpose now. It was a waste of money for us as we'll have to buy a new one.
2,not the right size,this cover is not big enough to cover a 12 ft. easy set pool. you can't tuck the ends under the ring. it just covers the water which i quess is enough to warm the water but if a strong wind comes up it will probably blow off.
2,Expensive Piece of......... Bubble Wrap,"First off, this is just an expensive piece of blue bubble wrap cut in a 12 foot circle. That's it!!In the photo it appears that the cover wraps around the edges of the pool. Nope. The cover which is exactly the shape of the inside diameter of the pool just floats on the surface of the water. No wrapping, no protecting, nada. We even found that it didn't work well with keeping leaves and stuff out of the pool because it wasn't easy to remove without dumping the leaves into the pool.Lastly, do not assume that this cover provides any sort of safety protection. It does not. Overall, I think this product is a waste of monty for the price."
3,Blue bubble wrap,It is the same solar cover I saw at Toys r Us for twice as much. My only concern is that is seemsto be basic bubble wrap tinted blue. My sons even tried to snap the bubbles.It's only been on the pool for 24 hours so I can't say if it helps or not.
3,Pool Cover,"It is kinda thin, not as thick as I thought it would be. It does warm the top 3"" of water of the pool. It says it fits a 12' pool, but it is bigger than that and hangs over."
3,kind of worth the money,"Yes, it is cheaper here than from your local store, but it just floats on top of the water, still letting in leaves and bugs room to get under it (especially if the wind blows). The other covers which have string to secure it would be better, and there is no way it heated up the pool water more than without the cover. CMS is the worst part of this, they shipped this in 6 days, then I ordered the saltwater generator 17 days ago and still it has not shipped, though my card was charged, and they won't respond to any e-mails."
2,Intex,"Well, it is for only one season, but it does the trick. The bubbles burst due to the Sun, and polyethylene is UV degradable. Since there is no better, you can buy it, but it ends up on the landfill...."
4,Works great,"Did a good job of boosting the temp in the pool about 5 degrees. My only suggestion would be if they oversized it to fit over the outer ring to prevent leaves and debris since it is about 4"" smaller in diameter and all the debris seems to find that gap. Super easy to get on and off."
2,not as great as its rating,"I decided to purchase this cover over the Intex Easy set because of its high rating. However, this cover is only good at covering the water surface from the sun. Dirt, leaves, and other insects can easily get in during the time the cover is pulled out from the pool regardless how careful you are. For this reason and the price, I can only rate it 2 stars."
2,$26 for bubble wrap,"This sits on top of the water, inside the pool, although the instructions indicate that it gets tucked in at the outside edges. It is too small for that.It is a large piece of bubble wrap. I would not expect this to last more than one season."
4,Good for warming your pool,So i wanted to buy a cover to keep all the trash and stuff out and to protect my little bro from getting in. I must of read the description wrong because this is not a cover that wraps around the frame of the pool this is just a cover that floats on top. But this was my mistake. One thing tho we have a 12 foot pool and this leaves a gap of about 3-4 inches from the wall either i bought a pool that is slighty bigger that what was listed on the box :p or this is a bit small but hey no one is perfect. My pool with fresh water from the hose was at around 60-75 degrees and with this in one day warmed it up too 90 degrees. other than that is is a great pool cover to warm ur pool up and keep it clean.
3,ok,It works ok as a solar cover and does boost the temp nicely but dont expect it to keep rain water or debris out of the pool.
3,It Works!,"This solar cover does work, and probably gave us a couple extra weeks to swim before taking our pool down. It's actually a sheet of bubble-pop cut in a circle, so don't expect more."
3,Solar cover,"I ordered this product thinking it would help to warm the pool, which we have set up in a semi-shaded area, keep rainwater out, and also so that we could see inside the pool without having to remove the cover. Unfortunately, this cover is nothing but bubble wrap and it doesn't wrap around the underside/outside of the inflatable rim, it simply sits inside the pool on top of the water. With that said, tree debris and bugs can easily get in the water when removing or disturbing the cover. Were still using it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this product."
3,gonna look for a better cover,i bought this pool cover from the store last year and it does do what it says it heats up the pool pretty good which is great cuz my kids hate going in the pool when the water is freezing. the only down side that i can see is it does not go over the sides of the pool which makes it hard to keep debri out of it. I would have given it 5 stars if it covered over the sides to keep stuff out a little better other then that i like the fact the it helps to heat the water so i think i'm gonna get another one to put on the pool at night and use the solar one in the day when the water is to cold.
3,Bait & Switch,"I ordered the Intex Krystal Clear 12' solar cover, an receive the lesser quality blue cover. I did not return it because I really needed a cover for the pool asap. VERY POOR PRACTICE AMAZON."
1,Just a big piece of bubblewrap,"This is just a big piece of bubblewrap cut into a circle. No more, no less. For 20 bucks. Bubblewrap. It only extends to the inner walls of the pool, it does not fasten to the pool perimeter at all. I thought it would have an elastic edging to it to stretch over the inflated tube but it does not.UPDATE: Meijer has one for 15 bucks that has the bublewrap-like solar material but also covers the entire pool with a drawstring to keep it on."
3,Company's size misleading,"The cover does help heat the pool, but the actual size is only about 11.5 feet so it does not actually cover the entire top of our pool, therefore leaves and insects still get in the pool when the cover is on."
3,Good Early Bernstein Interpretations Of American Music,"This CD will most likely be of interest to those who collect historical recordings; of which the Isaac Stern performance of the Barber violin concerto will be most appealing. However, I believe the best performances are of Barber's Adagio for Strings and the lesser works of Schuman. Bernstein does a splendid job coaxing as much emotion as he can out of the New York Philharmonic's string sections in Barber's Adagio. The Barber concerto sounds okay, but I have not heard any of the more recent interpretations mentioned by other reviewers to state definitely whether this performance is vastly inferior to recent releases. Still, the sound quality of all these recordings sounds a bit dry by contemporary standards, even with the latest in digital-bit-imaging technology."
3,Was OK,"Not up to normal ""Louis L'Amour"" standards but as I have been a fan for a long so still found the story of some interest."
2,Lone Star Law,Book was understood to be stories written by Louis L'Amour but they were not. Some of the stories I did not like partly because of the way they were written and partly because of their content
1,Lone Star Law,Other than L. L'amour's story it was a wash out for me. Wish I had checked it out on cloud first. Most were crude as well as coarse.
5,The reaction was PRICE-less,"I bought this for my one and a half year old grandson. I wanted him to have a doll to hug and play with. After playing with it a while, he dropped to the floor and started shaking. My daughter looked at him then me and asked ""Mom? What's he doing?!"" He was imitating Baby Shrek. By that point it was a toss up on who was funnier, the doll or him."
5,Andre Rieu Christmas I Love VHS,"Check EBay, WJCT occassionaly offers this video. All proceeds go toward broadcasting."
4,Andalucian influences in prog rock,"This album follows an excellent formula for symphonic progressive music of finding a great melody sung by the band's amazing female vocalist (who has a distinct Spanish flourish and form), or played on a traditional acoustic instrument, adding an intro and outro and embellishing with appropriate more electric and acoustic instrumentation. It works throughout. Andalucia is the part of Spain subject to influences from North Africa, France, and all over the Mediterranean. Amarok uses all these exotic sounds in their own context, such as flamenco guitar with Spanish rhythms and oud with Turkish background, all within a rock song. These people know their neighbors. Mujer Luna is also excellent."
4,A must for fans of Bo Skovhus,"My test track is ""Wohin?"" - especially when the signer comes to ""Es singen wohl die Nixen tief unten ihren Rein"" (sorry for my German spelling!). Bo doesn't bring quite the right pathos. But there is no perfect recording of this most poignant of song cycles. If I was forced to choose one singer, it would be Peter Schreier."
3,Very overpriced for the amount of content but is useful,"This book is a useful summary of many of the features of VB .NET. It does skips over important issues such as multithreading or I/O and is hardly complete (not unexpected for the small number of pages).My real complaint though is the cost per page for this kind of reference: this book is 280 small format pages and I feel it is extremely overpriced for the amount of material it contains. You would be much better served with the O'Reilly book ""VB NET in a Nutshell"" which is similar in thrust, has more than twice as many pages and costs less!If this book were ... it might be worth buying but at ... I would suggest people pass."
1,Thrown together.,"I used this book as a preparation for the Beta exam. It was pretty useless. It has many typographical and code errors such that it looks like it was thrown together at short notice. With at least one chapter, the technical content very questionable. Very much a rush job in my opinion."
5,worth every penny,"This is exactly the type of VB.NET, sorry I mean VB .NET, book that I was looking for. I'm a VB developer that was looking for a book to provide the necessary knowledge to understand the new paradigm which didn't take months to get through to read."
5,Great even without a boat,"You may think it's weird, but when I'm out hiking in the woods with my dogs I use this great little signal horn to call them if they can't hear me yell ""Come!"" I live in a forest that also has coyotes and rattlers so it's really urgent for my dogs to come fast.When I honk this loud horn, the dogs turn on a dime and return as fast as their legs can carry them. It's a huge help!"
1,Bernstein Century - Schuman: Sym. 3 & 8,"I'm sorry, I just don't get it. All the reviews both here and in the literature that came with the disk are positively glowing. However, although well performed, to my uneducated ear this just sounds like ""random music."" It's the muscial equivalent of abstract art. For me, it was a waste of money."
2,Rubber Seal Quits Working Over Time,"I, too, bought this dispenser so that I could easily refill my three cats' bowls each day. While this dispenser is attractive, functional and air-tight, it is too small to hold a week's worth of food and I have to hold my hand next to the opening to keep the triangular-shaped food from being shot across the counter.After less than a year, I had to discard it because the rubber seal on the bottom kept falling off."
4,got the wrong product,I ordered this for dispensing dry cat food.Amazon shipped me the counter top model. I mounted it on the wall anyway.I like it.
5,A Great Old Book,"This is a fantastic children's story with beautiful illustrations. It has a great moral and a very good story line.The only thing I would caution about reading this book to children is that is uses the word queer, which in its meaning is just fine, it's just I worry teaching this word to children who may use it at an inappropriate time or be misunderstood by an adult who doesn't understand their use of the word."
5,A childhood classic for two generations!,"I loved this book when I was little, and my aunt got it recently for my son. He's not 3 yet, and I thought the story might be too long for him, but he LOVES it. He regularly demands his ""wighthouse stowy"" and sits enraptured for the entire thing. We're nowhere near New York, but if we ever go, I would love to take him to see the real lighthouse!The story itself is very simple -- a small lighthouse on the Hudson River feels very important until a huge bridge is built right next to it. But when a storm comes up and endangers the boats on the river, it realizes that both it and the bridge have their own special jobs. I think it's a great lesson for kids: Even though you're small, you're important, and you can make a difference."
4,Everyone is Needed,"This is a great book for young and old. It reminds us all that no matter who we are - or if we are young or old, we have a part to play in this world. Each person is given something that they can do to help others."
4,A timeless classic,"The story of a little red light house who finds out that even though it is small, it can still be useful. My dad read this book to me when I was a kid, and I sought the book out when I had a child. The book is great because it is about a real life thing, the little red light house at the base of the George Washington Bridge (though it is never named in the book).Also great, is that this story saved the Little Red Lighthouse from destruction, got it placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and got it operational again. The coloring in this book is much more vibrant than my childhood book (I compared them)."
5,Sweet reminder...,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for one of my eight grandbabies. Upon receiving my order...I decided to read through each of my book choices and started with this one. Reading it brought back very sweet memories of when I heard it years ago. I later shared it with my children and now the next generation.. it most certainly stands the ""test of time"". Absolutely a ""must share"" with your little ones!"
4,Something has been missed,"Many of the other reviews have covered much ground, but all seem to have missed one thing: the point of McGrath's argument. It is really quite simple: Science cannot proove the existance of God, but neither can it proove the non-existance of God. Either way, you are excepting your position on faith, but faith isn't always a bad thing. Consider the proposition: it is always, everywhere, and at all times wrong to believe something not based on proof. Correct? No, there is no proof for that statement, and thus it is self-referentially incoherent. McGrath talks about this in 'The Twilight of Atheism'.If you accept that statement as true, you cannot prove either the existance, or the non-existance of God. If you recognise the incoherance of it, you must realize that the only way to know anything at all is by faith.It is quite a simple argument really. McGrath isn't trying to prove the existance of God, he is trying to show the fallacy involved in Dawkin's polemic against God."
1,Exclusive,"I have deep faith. My belief in G-d and His love is strong. So you would have thought that I would feel comfortable with Professor McGrath's line of arguing against Dawkins' strident anti-religion rhetoric. But the truth is, it left me angry and alienated. Why? Because McGrath consistently equates faith and belief in the Divine with Christianity. I am a Jew - a member of that people who have suffered from centuries of persecution from people such as McGrath who believe that Christianity has the sole preserve in this area. Muslims have adopted a similar mindset. The truth is that all three religions believe in the same G-d. Of the three, only Judaism is happy to accept that this (along with the other six Noachide laws) is enough. The position of exclusivity inherent in McGrath's writing is grist to the Dawkin's mill that equates religious faith with all that's wrong with the world. A plague on both their houses."
1,Defending the undefensible,"McGrath in all his books is desperately trying to defend the Judeo-Christian God that has caused so much misery in the Western World. The three Abrahamic religions have the same ambivakent monster as a God. Anyone that looks at History and the atrocities due to monotheism extremists in Judaism,Christianity and Islam, understands why many thinkers, from Voltaire and Paine to Dawkins rebuke magic thinking and the idea of an Eastern Tyrant as a God. McGrath, is neither a scientist nor can he (or anyone else) make a truly rational defense of the Judeo-Christian despot. If there is anything beyond Nature, whatever that could be, we should hope is is a benevolent, freedom-loving entity."
1,Theistic Apologetics,"McGrath gives us yet another dry meaningles attempt to justify blind faith. Why blind, because McGrath and other simply fail to understand that the argument that, there is no credible evidence that a supernatural being exists in some supernatural domain. No reputable Christian thinker has ever provided a viable case why such a being is anything more than human wish fullfilment. McGrath's book could have been reduced to a few short pages saying I think Dawkins is wrong because I can't believe there is no God."
4,From Russia with terror.,"Josef Rosenburg fled the Jewish pogroms in Russia with Tanya, the small daughter of family friends, the only survivor of a brutal massacre.They survive in Amsterdam after a walk across thousands of miles in bitter cold, to meet a rogue Pieter, who displays a worrying attraction to Tanya. When Pieter shows Josef a magnificent uncut diamond which he had stolen from a South African miner, Josef sees a way to make a life for himself and Tanya in London but at the cost of Tanya's innocence.He deliberately leaves Tanya in Pieters care for 10 minutes, knowing full well what the terrible result will be.Returning to to the screams of the terrified child, he kills Pieter and takes the stone.They reach London where he cuts the stone, selling it for a huge sum which enables him to begin a diamond and jewellery business.The story continues as a family saga over several generations, much affected by Josef's crime and with long lasting consequences."
1,As bad as it gets!!!,Random thoughts. Lightly organized. Pseudo intelectualism. Pedantic. All that effort wasted to explain card tricks and look smart at parties.
5,Entertaining for my busy boy,My son is nearly 2 and this is a book he chooses nightly to read. The various means of transportation thrill him. His vocabulary has grown from this book. He now points out all types of things from vans to tractors to the zamboni machine at the end of the book. A great book and something I would recomend.
2,no not really,"Listen over all this is a kinda good dvd except the price should be like $10.listen i love the show the fairly oddparents but this dvd is not good enough. it has awesome episodes but its missing 2. 1 its missing the big superhero wish{duh why did they release this in the first place}! and 2 they left out the best crimson chin,superhero,and maybe even best episode ever. the one when all the crimson chins from the 40s to now come to face all the villans!If they had these 2 episodes id get this dvd right away!!!!! As a matter of fact the only nickolodeon dvd id reccomend is spongbob the complete first season{WAITING FOR NUMBER 2!!!!!}. The other only good cartoon dvds are simpsons seasons 1,2,and3{waiting for season4}overall this has too get 2 stars for missing the best 2 superhero episodes ever."
3,All right,"I can't say that this is the best of the Fairly Oddparents collections, but it is a decent one and in some ways a parody of X-Men and other superhero franchises. This is not an actual movie per se, but rather a collection of ten episodes, most of which contain the Crimson Chin or are superhero-inspired. All in all, it's a okay collection, though it makes more sense to have DVDs of the whole series rather than a few themed episodes."
5,It is what it is...,A Mercedes oil filter adapter that works. Buy it if you need it. BTW I love assenmacher tools. blah blah
2,I love Beverly Barton but........,"I must agree with the previous reviewer. I love the series, but unfortunately this did not live up to my expectations.I did not care either way for the lead characters and at most times found the heroine anoying (she may be a strong character - but she had no sense). The hero supposedly the professional ""action man"" let an untrained person (ie the heroine)into situations (because of guilt) that did not hold with the ""protector"" ideology and/or cause injuries to others! In fact the heroine needed protection from herself.I am sorry that I could not give this book more stars. But a word of caution to first time Beverly Barton readers, don't let this book put you off. She is an expectional writer and I will still continue to purchase more of her books."
2,You get what you pay for,"The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star is because of the price. I assure you, you can do better with a piece of plywood for the same price though. Oh, and the picture is a bit deceiving...it does not stretch the length of a couch. It's one of those photos that they're not technically making the claim, but assume many people will see it that way."
2,Not what was expected,"I didn't really notice a difference upon using this product nor did anyone else who frequently uses the couch. I got what I paid for, but would not recommend this product."
4,Sofa Support,"Product received very timely and in good condition. Not sure it works as well as I thought it would, but I'm giving it a try."
5,"Trascends comparison with ""Romeo and Juliet""","Largely, I agree with the review given above. I saw ""Vukovar"" with a Serbian friend while a student at NC State University, and it is a film which is impossible to forget. The story is very moving, and the talented cast portrays each role with an emotional depth which surpasses most reknowned actors. The scenery, distressingly showing the natural beauty of the Balkans in ruin of war, is filmed with remarkable insight into the resonance of its symbolism in the human plot. The score, featuring selections from Mozart's Requiem mass, is exquisite and heart-wrenching. I recommend this film to every man, woman, and child who has ever believed in the glorified myths of war we inherit from our media. ""Vukovar"" is the truth of war. I have never seen another film that brought tears to everyone who witnessed it. You will never forget ""Vukovar."""
3,Ours leaks too,"When we let go of handle, it keeps spraying for a few seconds which will add up to a lot of wasted chemicals after a while. Instead of using it professionally, we'll use our trustworthy B&G and use the Chapin for around the house. It works well, it just has the extra spray issue."
4,Good value for the money,"The Chapin Premier seems to be a lower end professional sprayer as advertised. Its quality of construction is significantly better than the ""homeowner"" sprayers that approach the same price group. It is probably not suitable for the commercial user who plans on daily use but more than adequate for anyone who wants a long lasting tool for occasional to frequent use. I recommend this product. Good quality for a good price."
5,Quality at last!,"With two acres of mostly landscaped yard I needed a sprayer that would go more than one season and when it wears out can be repaired instead of thrown away(I recently took three old plastic ones to the dump). After much research and finally deciding to spend the extra for the stainless steel model, my spayer arrived from Chapin. I could not be more pleased. I took it out and two things were immediately apparent, first it is of very solid construction and all of the parts are high quality and can be replaced if they do wear or break. It worked beautifully and I know this is the last sprayer I will be buying. You can spend $300 or more from a commercial supplier and get this type of quality but I hoped I could do that for under $100 and the Chapin Premier Model 1253 is it."
3,"The ""Anything But"" Definitive Collection","A reasonable bunch of songs, which however can make no claim to offer a definitive overview of Earle's career. The selection of songs favors Steve's early career during which he garnered more mainstream country airplay. The handful of post-jail selections by no means represent the best of later Earle's work and aren't even the best songs from Train a Comin', I Feel Alright, and El Corazon. The 1997 date is an odd terminus as well since Steve was riding a creative wave with The Mountain, Transcendental Blues and Jerusalem all following in quick succession."
3,Three great songs.,I never like all songs on an album. I thought three were great and the rest not very destinctive.
5,Got what I wanted,"I got everything that came with the camera and the camera works like it should. It was a gift to my mom, and she loves the camera. The camera was shipped quickly and so far no problems. I would shop here again."
1,Throw it in the trash with the psychedelic wallpaper!!,"I had to take part in a performance of this anti-Catholic monstrosity in college, and I discovered that everything negative that has been said about it is true. It is a tasteless, vulgar piece of propaganda written in the Sorry Seventies by a composer who was obviouly at the end of his sanity. Bernstein uses the sacred words of the Catholic Mass and massacres them, using them for political purposes, mocking them, and clothing them in the most trashy and banal music. Don't waste your money on this dated piece of garbage."
4,Simply Great!,"Leonard Bernstein has created a look at the religous arts and emotions of the time. Bernstein uses so many colors in his music that one can see a painted picture in his/her mind. The only thing I disliked about it, in my opinion, is the use of inconsistent musical patterns. Overall its a favorite of mine."
3,Bernstein's Mass,"This is a difficult piece to comment on because it embraces such a mixture of styles. Premiered in 1971, there is much that reminds you of West Side Story from a decade or so earlier in its 32 movements. There is the format and snippets of text taken from the Catholic Mass that are truly reverent - but many of the words are provided by Stephen Schwartz and Bernstein, some of which provide sections redolent of the joy of Negro spirituals. The Agnus Dei reminded me of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. Bernstein does warn us that this is a theatre piece for singers, players and dancers - so we are forewarned if we are expecting something along the lines of the Duruflé Requiem. Personally I found it a difficult work to settle into for these reasons. Perhaps my musical ear is not yet sufficiently tuned to contemporary music - if that's not an inappropriate comment 40 years after it was written."
4,Nice introduction to a much misunderstood devotion.,"Finally, a lovely and loving book about the numerous apparitions of the Virgin Mary over the past several centuries. This volume will be a welcome addition to the library of any Marian devoté, as well as an informative primer to those unfamiliar (or misinformed) about the nature and varieties of both the apparitions themselves, as well as those who experienced them. The authors also show how the visions continue to be of interest and value to modern-day persons. An excellent selection of photos of many home-made shrines is included, demonstrating how the Virgin Mary attracts even the most lowly. What most of the shrines lack in artistry, they more than make up for in charm. Another nice addition is the variety of cultures depicted. Even though I am a very well-read Catholic, there were several apparitions that I had never heard of. I really enjoyed this book. I only wish it were longer and more comprehensive."
3,Rare chance,"This is a rare chance to see younger Menuhin in quite a few selections. Could have bee handled better, though. Picture and sound occasionally out of sync, sound not cleaned up, picture restoration kind of non-existent...seems generally to have been not handled with the kind of tender loving care the rarity of the material demands and the product notes boast about. That being said, having seen it, I would have bought it anyway for the opportunity to see Menuhin. Not insurmountable difficulties for the somewhat adventurous viewer/listener."
2,A disappointment,"I ordered this after watching the entire original series. The recipes are fine, and what I expected. The book itself fell apart in my hands."
5,AWSOME INTERNET POKER TIPS,I bought this Dvd and popped it into the player and it opened up my eyes. Since watching it my game has increased tremendouslyI look for little things that i didnt think were possible on Online poker and it has helped my accountI have almost every DVD on Poker..this one is clearly the best...and the cheapest...strange how that works
3,It should be sold on QVC,"The DVD is a short instructional video about online poker. It actually gives some helpful hints on how to win while playing online. Unfortunately, at the end of every segment, the young instructor is promoting his online website where he sells additional tools to ""help"" you win online. I started to feel like I was watching an ""infomercial""."
5,Dinner Music (Songs of Elegance for Fine Dining),"Mellow or romantic, this is the music you want to play when you're eating good food, either alone or with someone special."
5,Cherry Cheesecake Murder,"Joanne Fluke is always a fast, easy read. She has a great sense of humor and the characters are familiar."
3,Cherry Cheesecake Murder,"This is another entertaining selection from Fluke..the mystery is somewhat slow paced but not bad. My complaint is with the Norman/Mike situation. In every book, I find myself thinking ""surely, this Norman/Mike romance will be resolved!"" Only to find out by the end of the book it's the same old, same old! This storyline is totally unbelievable! No two guys are going to continue to date the same gal year after year and still remain good friends? Not likely and besides, it has become totally boring and predictable! Either have Hannah choose one or the other or bring in someone that she falls for and marries! It would put us out of our misery!"
5,Cherry Cheesecake Murder,I love this author. She has a way of getting you hooked on the story and making you feel as if you are part of the story. One of the things that I like about her stories is I am able to read this story to my students at work. I can hardly wait for her next murder.
2,Maybe the series has gone on too long,"The series, with the 'two love interests' core, is beginning to wear. The mysteries are still good, but when the characters annoy you the book is simply not as enjoyable. The recipes are still amazing, though. A decent fluff read if you've read everything else that's good, but there are much better books of this genre out there."
3,Simple and cute story,"I found this book, along with the series, to be along the simple side which allows readers of all levels to enjoy the cute stories. Tracey, Hannah's niece, is quite the character although I find some of her reactions unrealistic for a kid her age. Despite the now tedious relationship tangle between Hannah and Mike and Norman, this book was well written and entertaining. I found that I enjoy the way the author wrote Michelle's character more and more and hope that she continues to play a big part in the series. Please though, can Hannah make a decision and stop stringing these guys along? Hee hee!"
2,Cherry Cheesecake flops,"I have read every one of Ms. Fluke's cookie shop mysteries and enjoyed them until this one. Hannah's relationship with Mike AND Norman is too unrealistic and strange. Obviously, she doesn't REALLY love either one of them or she would make a decision. I can't imagine any man who would wait around while Hannah is so wishy-washy. Also, the murder occurs too far into the story. There is too little action and too much unrealistic behavior. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this volume."
5,BEST ONE EVER,"Ms. Fluke has done it again. Another GREAT Hannah Swensen mystery. I love this whole series. Super storylines and it's fun being reunited with the regular characters in Lake Eden. I really liked the Hollywood movie set background in this one. And what about Ross? Hmmm, hope he appears in a future story. Mike, Norman and Ross. To me, the more the merrier. As in all of the Hannah mysteries, the plot has wonderful twists turns and surprises. And the yummy recipes that are sprinkled through the book are a terrific bonus. If you're a new reader, grab this one. You'll love it and want to read all of the others. Hannah's a ""keeper."""
3,An okay entry in a struggling series,"I have read all of the Hannah series, and the last three novels have begun to strain my patience. I find both Andrea and Tracey increasingly annoying, and am frustrated by the so-called love triangle between Hannah, Norman and Mike. There needs to be some resolution of the proposals and Hannah's relationship with both Norman and Mike. No person would have a ""ready to marry you"" relationship with two people at the same time.This story moved slow, only picking up pace 2/3 of the way into the book after the murder occurred. This, in my opinion, occurred too late in the story and the last third, the part with Hannah investigating, seemed rushed and almost an afterthought. This is what I usually read this type of book for, the mystery.While I will give the author another try in her next book, there may need to be some major shake ups for me to continue with this series that continues to struggle."
3,Frustrating,"Was it just me or did any other readers find the tone of the writing style a little condescending to the reader? The need to explain the meaning of amorous, etc.? And Tracey was just a tad over the top in precociousness in this one. I still like the setting, the characters, and the recipes but I am frustrated with the triangle (and really can't relate to it especially with marriage in the picture). I think both men should dump Hannah! If the situation isn't resolved by the next installment, so am I."
2,I give up. No more Hannah books for me,"Come on, Joanne! Mike is a slut, Norman is everything a woman could possibly want, and this is what you do? Sigh. I give up. You make Hannah look like some kind of nasty tease. Norman needs to go find a woman who won't lead him around by the nose and then go chasing off after some pretty boy who has told her more than once that his job is more important than her! No more, Joanne - I didn't finish this one - - and I am really disappointed. Not only is Hannah such a screw-up that she not only teases two men, but then decides that maybe she wants to try someone new? What? You were afraid if you put her in a stable, loving relationship, we wouldn't read any more? BUZZZZZ! Wrong..... I give up here. And it is a shame, I was really enjoying seeing Hannah as a strong, thoughtful, considerate and loving woman, well able to make her decisions knowing that she could rely on her own heart. Point me at Norman - I will take him if she doesn't want him!"
2,SLOW setting cheesecake,"I have been reading all the books and loved them thus far, but this one is just too slow moving. I am at page 200 and no murder yet. Will continue to read but don't find it as interesting as all the others. Hope the next one is better."
3,A little too cheesy,"A film production company arrives in a small Minnesota town and everyone is agog hoping to appear on screen. Hannah, owner of The Cookie Jar bakery, and her two sisters have a behind-the-scenes ""in"" since one sister is part of the film crew and Hannah was once college chums with two of the principles who are now Hollywood celebs. It is a four or five star read for the first 200 pages. Then there is a murder and the sisters begin to snoop; alas, the narrative goes down hill rapidly at this point and we are in Nancy Drew territory with several pointless adventures before the villan is unmasked.(I wonder if the writer had to meet a deadline and merely tossed the ending together; it seems underwritten somehow.) Not a hopeless read by any means, but disappointing nonetheless."
4,not my favorite,i have read all of these books and have loved every one of them. but this deff wasnt her best work. BTW i want Hannah to pick Mike! Norman seems more like the best friend type than the husband type.
1,"Eventually, there's a murder.","As others have mentioned, the murder happens eventually, but not before many, many pages of set-up. The was the worst and weakest book of the series.The Hanna/Mike/Norm triangle is getting tiresome. For two casual and chaste relationships to suddenly blossom into marriage proposals is just not interesting. A reader can only suspend belief so far.Then, there's Hannah's mother... This character is ruining the series for me. All three daughters are complete doormats when this shrew makes demands. She treats them like children and the 3 grown daughters ACT like children. Mother Swenson doesn't add anything to the plots but annoyance and her character has not grown or changed. It's difficult to believe that Hannah can stare down someone with a gun pointed at her but can't talk back to her Mommy."
5,Cherry Cheesecake Murder,"I enjoyed this book very much, it was a very easy book to read. The story was very well writen."
2,"Love cozy Lake Eden, not so much Hollywood !","I love love Hannah and all the people of small town Lake Eden. All her books so far are 5 stars except this one :( To be honest, I turn to Hannah to take me far way from my crazy LA Hollywood life :D So I was not a big fan when Hollywood came to Lake Eden. I have to say the author did a great job portraying the true lifestyle and schedule and movie talk of the industry, but I like cozy Lake Eden and its people, and this book made me think of work and stress :(I want to move to Lake Eden ! Who wants to come along :D"
2,The Mystery is... Where does it start?,"I'm a fan of the series, and look forward to reading the books. After reading the Sugar Cookie Murder, with everyone in one building for the whole story, I was looking forward to the adventure of Cherry Cheesecake Murder. It opened exciting... right away getting into the murder... only to go into ""two weeks earlier"" and proceed for well over 200 pages of no mystery at all, just baking and some boring details about the movie where everyone in Lake Eden turns out to be a movie star.For a 363 page mystery to end up with roughly 130 pages of actual mystery ... if we're lucky, because there is still a lot of dating and more movie making in those 130 pages after the mystery finally starts, is sad. I like the side stories and small town feeling to these books, but this one just started 200 pages too slow."
1,Don't waste your time,"Just because mysteries are light and entertaining, it doesn't mean that the author should talk down to the reader. None of the words in this story needed to be defined for the reader, yet they were. The characters were one-dimensional and unbelieveable, the dialogue was ridiculous and the murder storyline was boring. This was a poor book on all levels."
5,WANT METAL?,"To be completely honest with you, i was somewhat skeptical about purchasing this cd. i'm glad i did. What talent these boys have! The musicianship is impeccable. i'm a sucker for the classic metal riffage and this album has it. influences are obvious here but make no mistake, they are genuine. like anything else there are going to be critics shaking their heads, just keep in mind these are the same people who think Korn is Metal. i HIGHLY recommend this CD."
3,Enjoyable Power Metal,"I tend to file this among the ""fluffy"" power metal bands. Good melodies but little real substance. They are not very heavy, more in the style of Gamma Ray, say, than Blind Guardian. Not at all bad, the melodies are very good, but certainly no masterpiece."
5,This is a GREAT CD! Buy it now!,"The production is stellar. The musicianship is excellent. The songs are awsome. Amazon recommended the disk to me based on previous purchases, and I thought, ""Why not? - I've got a few bucks to waste."" I'm so happy I got this. I'm not familiar with other bands in this genre, but to someone who grew up listening to 80's metal, it sounds like a cross between Iron Maiden's music and Europe's harmonies. If you like melody with your metal, and some classical overtones, you'll probably like this. Long live classic European metal -- 'cause GOD knows TRUE metal's dead in the USA."
2,"Blah, boring, trite",Title says it all. I find this CD to be tedious and devoid of any musical inspiration. End of story.
4,Highly stimulating yet dry at times,"This hefty tome is a real find for those who like a little science with their fiction. The basic premise is that in one way or another most of humanity is already a CYBORG. The definition is a bit broader than say Arnold in the Terminator and encompasses everything from fillings and eyeglasses to using a computer. I enjoyed the exploration of the CYBORG as a media icon. The technical discussions and NASA reports were a bit dry but do add to the overall credibility of the subject. This book is a real winner and anyone interested in the interaction of politics,philosophy and the human body will enjoy it."
5,Horsing Around in New Jersey,This book surprises even those of us who deal with horses in New Jersey every day. There are wondeful nuggets of information which makes one want to get the horse on the trailer and do things. The author has an upbeat and good humored voice that is very enjoyable as well as informative. This is a must-have if you are a horse enthusiast. Read it and ride!
5,"great sound, great electronics, great look!","Having always wanted a 12 string, but being on a budget, I was happy to see the price on this Dean guitar. The shipping was very fast, the guitar plays like a much more expensive instrument, and I could not be happier with the whole experience!"
4,mexican wrestling and b movie love stories,ahh..!! los esquizitos...una banda cuyos integrantes se criaron admirando a Santo y Lorena Velazquez...Enrique Guzman y Angelica Maria...Mauricio Garces y Amadee Chabot...Viruta y Capulina...estos neo retro stylers fueron educados bajo el mando de Televisa alla por lo 70's...tal vez en su pubertad descubrieron a los Beach Boys o a The Ramones...tal vez trataron de ser contestatarios y anarquicos en sus dulces 16...tal vez se hicieron fans de las peliculas gringas de horror en lon 80's...tal vez y solo tal vez se dedicaron al rock n roll para divertirse y evadir una adultez demasiado aburrida...en fin...son muchas conjeturas..pero demos gracias de que estan aqui para ayudarnos a pasar un rato alegre y divertido escuchando su musica...
4,Recommend,If you are into the mystery spy thriller this book is for you. This is a real page turner. As a former soldier stationed in Korea I always wondered if there were any POW/MIA's still alive in North Korea and what they would be doing to survive. This book gives a plausible idea of how a POW/MIA may be living/surviving.I highly recommend this book!
5,Pleasantly Surprized,"AS a retired member of the military with three assignments to the Republic of Korea (9 years), I was quite surprized with the main idea for the book. Too young for the Korean War, and kept in the dark with the history of this war while in high school, I could not imagine the plight of our servicemen during that war. This book helped me in understanding soemthing our country did not want remembered, the Korean War, and by association, the servicemen and women who were there during this time. My uncle was one of them, a frozen Chosen survivor. I also found that this book took me back to my beloved Korea and gave me the inspiration to do a little research on the war and the many missing in action US servicemen. Extrememly well written and containing the right amount of military jargon, readers will find the ending suspencefull. I would recommend this book to persons who served in the military and to their family members."
5,Fantastic,"I absolutely love this purse! I've used it everyday for almost a year and it is still in great condition. It is just big enough to hold my wallet, ipod, phone, and a few other things very comfortably. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great sling purse. :)"
5,Awesome History,I am so loving homeschooling my daughter and this book is a great investment... We enjoyed all aspects of this book.
1,disappointed,I purchased this set of books because I needed books 1 & 2. On Amazon it was listed as Books 1 & 2. What I received was Book 2. False advertising!
2,Uninspiring,"Not sure if it's a complete lack of pictures or even short explanations of the dish, but I find this book completely uninspiring. A good cookbook makes you want to jump up and cook something immediately, but for me this is not one of those books, unfortunately. For a vegetarian cookbook, it also has surprisingly few vegetable-based recipes, mostly with ingredients that might not be fresh at a local supermarket (eggplant, okra, ""drumsticks""). At the same time way too much space is allocated to desserts (didn't care for any of them), snacks like ""spicy popcorn"" (do we really need a cookbook for this?) and chutneys. A somewhat decent section on breads is the only thing that's keeping me from getting rid of this book."
5,It is very easy and good,I found the book very easy to follow.The Receipts are simple but very testy.
3,Rather disappointed,"I purchased this based on 6 great reviews. I love to cook and am a long-time vegetarian, but I've not found a good Indian cookbook and have little to no experience cooking Indian foods.Unfortunately, I just haven't had a good experience with the recipes in this book. Most of them seem to use the same set of spices (hence, very similar tastes no matter what you make). I guess the recipes turned out OK, but not a winner. I thought this would allow me to make restaurant-quality Indian food (as it did for another reviewer), but it didn't. Just more fair-quality food. I liked one recipe with spinach and lentils but couldn't find a recipe for Naan, my chipatis didn't poof up like the recipe said they should, another lentil dish was rejected by my kids. You might be more experienced with Indian food and have better luck, but this cookbook was a disappointment for me."
4,No title,"Regrets, I have not used the glasses yet. I am sending them to my friends in Nigeria whom I hope will give me a feedback much later. I don't drive out here so I can't test them at the moment.Nock"
4,Great for reptiles!,"I bought this for my brother's 10 gallon anole set up. I love that is has a locking door on the top, because opening the whole screen has allowed his anoles to escape in the past. The only complaint I have is that the door doesn't seal completely flesh with the rest of the screen, so there were tiny openings that a very small animal could possibly get through. I think we may have had a small cricket escape that way. Otherwise it was a great investment."
4,Deep emotion carefully handled,"This album sounds like Cluster's ""Sowiesoso"" without Mobius' edgy influence; It's more mellow and quieter. The title track stands out as one of the best pieces of music I've ever heard in the Krautrock genre. ""Legende"" is another perfect track, possibly the best piano solo by anyone, ever. The overwhelming longing and sadness found in these two tracks almost makes me weep.Almost every track on this album is perfect: check out the 7th and 8th tracks (the break between them can't really be appreciated unless you have the vynil). Some great cyclic synth work going on here. And whoever is doing those drums has more than earned my respect. Also listen to ""Langer Atem"", a driving, pulsing rythm track shades of Terry Riley.The only reason I didn't give this one a 5 star rating is because of the track ""Willkommen"", which I think is awful. Other than that, this is a must have disc. My favorite for rainy days, or when you're waiting for a call from an old friend."
3,Go with the clear ones,"The picture looked Tan and I had a quick trigger finger when buying these and didn't realize they were Beige and not tan. My fault so no points off for that. However, I do own the clear ones in my other car, and I have had them for 2 years, worth the money. They clean up well, they stick the the carpet and don't move around. Though they are more money I wish I bought another pair of those."
1,not happy,"From the picture I thought the grooves of these mats would be more pronounced. They are practically flat, have stained easily and don't really trap dirt at all. Should have known from looking at them when they first arrived that they weren't going to work and returned them then. Too late now, so I guess they were a waste of money."
5,Good heavy duty mats,"These are great mats for the price. Nice and heavy enough where they don't constantly slip like my old mats. The staples are a little annoying, but not a total pain with a good set of pliers."
2,Not what i expected...,"As mentioned on another review, the grooves are very flat, and they don't trap snow very well.The color was great for my Honda Accord, but that is the only think great about this mats, i boughtheavy duty mats from Sam's club for the same price for my Honda Pilot, and they are 1,000 times better than this mats, they are sturdy and the grooves really trap snow, the problem is that they had only gray and black, so i had to buy this flimsy and thin mats from rubber queen.I don't understand how in another reviews they mention that they are great for heavy snow, they are not.But if you are looking for mats in this price range i don't think you can do better."
5,Good mats,I purchased these mats for my 09 Toyota Corolla and so far I am happy with them. They arrived in a timely manner and were easy to install. I just cut the top tabs that were stapled at the top and put them in my car. :)
2,Cheap Auto Floor Mats,"Well you know what they say, ""You get what you pay for"" This being said I would not recommend these floor mats. OK design but very thin. They will not stay in place, sliding around & rolling up. These problems can present a hazard around the brake & gas pedals. I decided to try another brand after doing my homework. I purchased ""Weathertech"" floor mats and couldn't be happier although I paid allot more for them. That being said I did get what I paid for."
4,Good Product!,The floor mats add a nice feel to the car and although the interior is a cream color there is brown on the dashboard thus bringing the colors together nicely. I am happy with the purchase.
2,Soncally dissapointing,There is something about the sound that is lacking on this disc...the orchestral just seems so mezzo forte at times in the Piano passages as to be annoying. Close miking with CBS is the real fault..the sound is dessicated and dry....instead try the DG microphone sound with Jochum and Emil Gilels and you will hear just how wonderful this piece can be recorded.
4,go buy this game just stop reading this review and buy it... NOW,"This game is fun to the heart. The explosions are hard core and I just love the team system. u can be allies or enemieswith 4 teams. There are 3 playable characters. u can hijack all vehicles except 1 of the helicopters. by now you are probably wondering why I didn't give this game 5 out of 5 overall. It does have good music, great game play and average graphics. The thing I don't like about this game is the ad is a fraud. It says all vehicles can be hijacked, but you can actually hijack all but one of the helicopters. What's really bad is they took the Grand Theft Auto free roam concept and covered it with a war concept. Although I haven't actually played Grand Theft Auto, from what I've heard it sounds like this. There's just one thing I would have liked--a multiplayer mode. Now, like I said in the title of this review, Go Buy This Game!"
1,"good concept, annoyingly bad execution","this game could be one of the best games out there, but it has way too many bugs. here are the most anoying ones: character gets trapped inside boulder and can't get out, game sometimes say there's no controller connected, and the most annoying one - I successfully entered the abort codes for the nukes after hours of really intense battles, eliminated the foot soldiers, then the game froze just as I was about to capture the ace of spades!!! what the heck!!!"
2,Yay. Another GTA Lite.,"Mercenaries is good. But that's it, really. It gets really repetitive, really fast. The formula is ""kill/apprehend this guy, do it again."" Shooting is extremely basic, with main controls being shoot and jump. Its cool that the game is big and open, with lots of vehicles, but it just seems like a lesser version of the popular Grand Theft Auto series. There really isn't anything fun to do inside the vehicles, except drive around. The game gets stale pretty quickly because its so repetitive and seemingly purposeless.The graphics are average at best. It has that trademark bland, jagged PS2 look with low resolution and low framerate. The colors aren't vibrant at all, but rather dull and muddy. Also, animations look artificial, like they belong in the N64 era. Music is great, but recording quality is pretty bad, resulting in a muffled kind of sound.Overall, this is a definite rental game. Give it a try if you're curious, but don't buy it right away."
1,how can i put this.... it sucks.,"the only way i can explain the positive reviews for this game are simply my theory that gamers are idiots. they'll play anything if it's given good reviews and other people like it. there's nothing new in mercenaries that hasn't been done before. you accept a contract. you drive around to the bad guy and subdue him or kill him. o...... k. all this has been done before (and vastly more interesting) in games like metal gear solid, call of duty, hitman etc. etc. etc. it's not fun or challenging, or original. also the gameplay itself is bad. shooting people isn't fun here, you just pull the trigger and move your crosshairs across the screen. boring. the graphics aren't very good either. just because other people say it's good doesn't make it so."
4,I always wanted to do THAT...!,"If you love GTA and Godfather, you will LOVE this game. The story line is pretty linear, with few suprises, but the action is spectacular. Imagine jacking an APC, rolling up on a North Korean checkpoint after taking out the grenade turret with your anti-tank rifle, and blowing up all the vehicles and buildings in sight? How about calling in a fuel-air bomb or having an A-10 drop a cluster bomb on your enemies? You can do all of this and more. Several times I created massive explosions, only to hear my on-screen character make some admiring comment about it on screen.The learning curve is short if you have any experience with GTA and such, and the wide-open game world gives you different ways to approach the missions.This game is a must-have."
4,Like GTA but in a war zone,"This is a surprisingly good game which is set in war-torn North Korea and you can travel wherever you want and do whatever you want. You begin with deciding which character you want to be: an American, British or Swedish mercenary, each with their own advantages when in combat.You can also choose to side with the Americans, the South Koreans, the Chinese or even the Russian Mafia as you bring in 52 war criminals, finally combating the General of the North Korean army himself.There are many missions you can choose to do from each faction, but it is hard to keep them all happy. There are also so many weapons and vehicles- from chopper to tank to sports car. This game is very good, but can be very hard in places."
5,WHAT A GAME !,"I have been playing games for some time now... I have tryed plenty of them..BUT this games would have to be the best one I have played, the fact that I can get into any Vehical I must say is just fantastic ! LOVE flying the "" egg beater"" and the "" Sniper Rifle"" well now WHAT can I say....!CAN'T wait for number two to come out !...The only other game that it would match would be only be "" HALO ""...only one word to discribe it, FANTASTIC !.ONLY hope the second one is as good..If you come home from a tough day and need to relaxe and take it out on someone, well what better way then to get into this game and let LOOSE on all the ' BAD GUYS ""' KROME '"
4,good game,Merenaries is an overall good game. You can get in just about any vehicle you see but if youre in certain vehicles you get shot at. Your best bet with vehicles is a civilian vehicle because nobody shoots at you.
3,Good fun but lack of depth becomes apparent.,"Fun and frustrating, as one reviewer put it, is the absolute truth. Going off in your own direction is indeed fun but everything you encounter is scripted and set in stone. The freedom is only half-real.I can't bring myself to play this game anymore because it has gotten boring. With all the things I'm supposed to be able to do, the frustrating elements and lack of variety turned me off for good. The only thing that changes when you are capturing/killing enemies is the scenery. Even that isn't very good. The animations are a little stiff and the level of control you have over your character is pathetic (move and shoot is the extent of it).The whole production just feels somewhat lacklustre although the core fun factor is definately there with all the explosions, damage and gunfire. There is also more than enough gametime involved with all the enemies to blindly run after. I only wish it could have packed more substance into it's shallow gameplay."
4,awesome..... but it takes to long to load,"I love this game alot, but theres like 5 loading screens before you even start playing. Since im not allowed to play gta, i play this instead.My dad thought it was like gta and some other war game mixed together."
5,One of the greatest games I've played,"What can I say? It's one heck of a game! It's fun. It's exciting. It's GTA in a warzone! You can do almost anything and everything in Mercenaries, which makes it so amazing! Walk, ride humvees, drive tanks, pilot attack helicopters. Use force with RPG's and RPK machine guns, or use stealth with a Dragunov sniper rifle or a silenced MP5 submachine gun. Kill your enemies yourself, or have your personal bodyguard do it for you. Not to mention, you can call in airstrikes (I personally find it fun to call in a carpet bomb on one high value target). Numerous fun and challenging missions, and a great re-play value. If you don't have this game, go get it!"
4,Fun,If you like Metal Gear Solid or the old Desert Strike type games you may want to give this a try. There is a lot of ground to cover and worthy missions to complete. Main missions are capture/kill. The story was straight forward. graphics were decent. Taking this concept and improving upon it would make a great game someday.
4,Awesome Game!,"I absolutley love this game. The guns are amazing, and the graphics are good. You can play as three different characters and each are awesome. The point of the game is to take out General Song's ""Deck of 52"". There are other factions like the Russian Mafia(My personal favorite), China, South Korea, and the Allies. They're contracts have nothing to do with the deck of 52 but they usually involve blowwing things up. You get money for destroying things! You can hijack any vehicle, even a helicopter or tank! I love stealing helicopters and blowing up enemies to make extra cash. There's only one thing I have a problem with. The game is incredibly frustrating. I'm up to the Ace of Clubs in the Deck of 52 and it's so hard and I keep dying. Sometimes I feel like smashing the controller. Overall, the game's great!"
2,Brutal Difficulty Level,Less than half way through this game the difficulty on the missions (contracts) becomes ridiculous. There are no difficulty levels to choose from. I wouldn't go for this game unless you're a hardcore gamer with a lot of patience.
3,Good price for Gates,"Good price for a Gates pulley. Works on my 2001 Chevy Venture with 3.4L engine. Downside is, made in China bearing and you cannot use the OEM pulley dust cover. The Dorman pulley might have been a better way to go."
1,Wrong Part,The Amazon fitment guide said a 38006 was correct for a 2005 Acura TL. Well it's not. The diameter is correct but there is a special recess on the oem part that is required for the mounting washer to fit correctly. There is no recess on the Gates/Amazon cross.
3,Still primitive,"This is Triumvirat's first album, and sounds primitive in comparison of more solid and inspired efforts like ""Illusions in a Double Dimple"", ""Spartacus"" and ""Old Loves Die Hard"". This album features keyboardist Jürgen Fritz and drummer/lyricist Hans Bathelt, who recorded the aforementioned albums, and bassist/vocalist Hans Pape, a good musician. The music previews how good this band would be, but still lacks focus in some parts. The bonus tracks, however, are very good (except, of course, the two edits - ""Be Home for Tea"" and ""Broken Mirror"") and makes the listener thinks what would have happened if this incarnation of Triumvirat have recorded another album."
2,Get the later stuff,"If you're looking for more stuff like Sparticus or Illusions, this isn't it. Admittedly a debut effort, this album simply is not in the class of the later efforts.If you must, buy it used. You'll thank me."
2,Sparse Debut Album,"I like a bands first album. It often shows them at their most original, most creative and most un-commercial.Here, however, Triumvirat show that not all long compositions are good ones. It's alright to make long progressive music but who wants to listen to a 10 - mintue organ solo? The Progressive tracks just aren't built up enough to hold the interest for such a long time.There are a few moments, particularly the two new tracks 'sing me a song' and 'ride in the night' that are ok but not enough good material to make it an enjoyable listen from start to end."
4,Chick Webb Was Before His Time.,"The Chick Webb Orchestra rates very highly when compared with other big bands of the mid and late thirties. And Chick Webb, of course, was a phenomenal drummer. All in all, this is a very enjoyable album. The two weaker points are: <1> some of the tunes are obscure and not very appealing, particularly on the first several listenings. and <2> since the original recordings were done close to 70 years ago, they are not the highest in fidelity; however, all things considered, the quality isn't bad. The two strong points are<1> Chick Webb's drumming, and <2>Ella's great singing."
2,Wood handles suck!!!,"After being introduced to Aebleskivers over a year ago, my whole family fell in love with them. Never once owning any cast iron cookware, I did not know of the various atributes to look for when purchasing one. NEVER BUY ONE WITH A WOOD HANDLE. The cast iron may last a lifetime (and then some), however with regular use, the handle completely deteriorated inside one year. I am now cooking entirely with cast iron and am looking to replace the aebleskiver pan with a fully cast iron one (Griswold being my choice for this pan, Lodge looks ugly)"
5,No non stick and it worked GREAT!,We quit using non stick a few years ago but received two of these type pans for Christmas with non stick from Williams-Sanoma and returned them but thought we would try this pan instead and really enjoy it.
4,Scooter is good - delivery was pits!,"Mega Motion 3-Wheel Travel Pal Scooter, Blue was purchased for my mother in law. It is what she wanted, was easy to set-up, and is easy to use. But - very frustrated with the delivery of the scooter as it took more than three weeks to arrive. Advertised as normally ships within 2-3 business days. I ordered on the second and it supposedly was not picked up until the tenth according to the tracking. On-line tracking showed the pick up on the 10th with no updates until arrived in Austin. Actual paper work at delivery indicated that it was not even picked up until sixteenth. Finally delivered on the twenty-third. The price was right but the delivery of this item was less than satisfactory."
5,Great Value,A great value. Very easy to assemble. The only critique I have is concerning the owners manual which needs to be a bit clearer in certain areas. There was a connection to be made which was not clear in the literature but when we called customer support they promptly returned the call and helped us resolve the issue in a matter of minutes. Delivery time was perfect and the delivery man was helpful and pleasant. Functionality as a travel Scooter is as expected. Overall a great value.
5,Just what we needed,"Inexpensive little compass with a nice sturdy lid, so we can throw it into a suitcase without fear of breakage. Easy to read, works great."
2,Just a toy compass:,"This compass is not worth even $6. The funny thing is, it came with an orange flea market sticker on it with a price of $3.09. I don't blame the seller for making a 98% profit, but I've seen toy compass(es) with better construction and more accurate readings. I would not recommend this item.(Really Amazon?!! The plural of compass is compass(es), I'm sorry your system cannot deal with the English language without flagging non swear words!)"
3,Gift for Young Hiker,Ordered this item for a 7 year old hiker. Got what I was expecting as far as the accuracy of the tool. Disappointed that the nylon lanyard unthreaded within an hour of the gift being opened.
1,Outtakes of imitation folk music that didn't make the doc,Hardly any of this music was heard in the wonderful documentary series. A poor album by a decent fiddler but a genuinely lousy composer.
4,Ride the Winds of the Tempest,"The essential guide for those who dare to face the terrible tides of The Sea of Shadows. The Sea of Shadow : A Storyteller's Guide to the Tempest presents detailed and vital information on the tempest and the perils that dwell amid its hazardous winds. Apart from giving a useful geographical description of the Tempest, Sea of Shadow features new arcanoi arts and valuable information about the inhabitants of the Tempest, including plasmics, and the mythic angelics and demonics. A must for storytellers and players alike, which chronicles develop in this part of the Underworld."
4,"A Huge Change from ""Kronet..""","I bought this CD by DHG because I loved Kronet til Konge very much. It seems that DHG changes their style with evey release. With Kronet..., they were a melodic, sad band.With the follow up to this, ""Satanic Art"", they are a keyboard laced, fast, futuristic b.m. band. With thir most recent, they are a techno b.m. band. With this, they take the much followed path of thrash influenced b.m.This is not a bad thing, as they do it very well. But this is not as good as Kronet.. (read my review of that). However, this is still great and essential. They blend thrash and b.m. into a style that fans of both will love. The songs are very well written, with aldrahn and vicotnik's trademark vocals on each and every one. If you like only the b.m. that has keyboards loaded down on it, this is NOT for you. For those into something inteesting and fairly original, this is one of the beat albums you will find. A must buy."
3,Geox European Sizing,"The concept of GEOX shoes is excellent, but as I found out, they are sized European (my size 11 is a 44), but they are very narrow. I had to send them back as I couldn't fit into them comfortable. I wear a regular size 11 American. Finish and materials are excellent."
5,he's baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack,"as a rabid be bebop deluxe fan, i lamented bill nelson's foray into experimental electronica.slightly interesting at best , i found myself completely disassociated from the former frontman of my all time favorite band.sometimes i would pick up one of his solo efforts, only to be disappointed.AND THEN...""after the sattelite sings"" blew me away.it is so different from the dreck you hear on the radio, or for that matter, the internet ""alternative"" stations.jazz, rock, electronic, blues. it has it all.of course, it has no commercial potential, because it requires thought and attention. but for folks whose musical taste is not formulated by the playlist of 3 classic rock stations, it's an oasis.i pray to jebus that there is more on the way."
5,At last!,"It's so refreshing to read a book about this disease without being scared to death each time you learn something new about the disease. It was also a relief to know that my grumpiness was common to, I thought it was me! Brilliant book, well written and informative without being shocking, and positive without being overly optimistic. Thankyou P J Haybach, you've helped me a lot!"
5,A must have for anyone with Menieres,This book was such a blessing in my life. I read it over and over when I first got it. So much of the information I was already experiencing but didnt' know why. I learned more from this book and my online support group than from any doctor.
3,Outdated and dangerous,Good intentions prevail throughout this book; good high level advice on coping is shared. But it's a dated book. Vertigo can be stopped in 85%~90% of cases by taking Valtrex 1000mg or Zovirex 800mg three times a day for 4~6 weeks. These drugs are not even mentioned in this older book and could lead many a reader to consider drastic irreversible surgical management.list of sources:[...]
2,Not as sturdy as i thought,"I wanted something where my daughter, almost 5, can store her entire leappad frog items. the former model, which seemed sturdier was not sold anymore so i ordered this one. i am a bit dissapointed as the bag is not really sturdy and so soft. it works but i am not sure how long. i would not recommend it."
3,MMPR Goldars Vice Versa,"This episode is pretty stupid its about when Adam the black ranger has no date to a vice versa dance until he meets a mysterious girl;She turns out to be Scorpina who has set Adam and Aisha up.Now the rangers must fight Scorpina and that overgrown giant yellow monkey Goldar.I wouldnt buy this tape considering Adam was only good as the zeo ranger 4 green, unless you just want to look at how fine Scorpina is."
2,Nice Chicago Sports centered book on the Faith,"Not the smoothest of writing styles, but a great subject and intense attitude of the Catholic faith.Written in interview style this book does not flow as it could. The sports stars are interesting and the faith spoken by most of them is clear and powerful but the ""too live"" interview style weakened the message for me. I was hoping to get some intense Catholic sound bites from great sports heroes but I came away feeling that it could have been stronger and easier to read.It does feature quite a few Chicago area sports people so it gets my Chicago thumbs up. But sports and faith should be stronger than this book gives off."
1,overrated,I got this book for my grandson who is an excellent high school baseball player. The only baseball player featured in ths book was the discredited Sammy Sosa. I certainly did not want this jerk to be an example for my grandson! I returned the book to Amazon.Champions of Faith: Catholic Sports Heroes Tell Their Stories
3,Not For Everyone,"These are old Soft Core B movies. The girls aren't bad looking and the sex scenes are pretty good. I couldn't believe how b-tt ugly and stupid the men were, but if your into these type of movies it wasn't bad."
4,Illusions on a Double Dimple,I am just filling out my CD library with titles I used to have in album format and through the years have lost or they have gotten unplayable. Great album though.
4,Okay book,Overall it was a good book. I thought the heroine let the adopted daughter get away with to much. If the girl had a problem with rules she should take her chances back on the streets. I am in my early twenties and felt this situation was wrong. The girl was fifteen and pregnant and was allowed to do as she pleased. I know sometimes teens do what they want but there has to be boundaries. The heroine was trying to be her friend so she wouldn't run away. But she was an enabler. She knew riding the motorcycle and being with the boyfriend would endanger the baby but said nothing. Sometimes you have to play the friend card but still you have a responsibility as a parent with a child under your roof.
5,Great read,This book hooks you in from the very first page.I couldnt put it down and read it in two nights.
3,The Baby Doctor,"Hmmmmm, this starts well, but you can already figure out the ending from the get-go. Story is just a story. Spelling should have been double checked. Read it in few hours but do not love it."
3,"Quick read, could be better",I was glad the book was free. It was an easy read. The characters are well described but the plot was not as engaging as other books I read.
5,"The voice, the sound quality and the interpretation",Put this on your stereo and if it is good enough the depth and richness of Robeson's voice will make your fillings rattle and your chest rumble. The power of his voice is awesome. This CD is superbly recorded with no audible noise at normal listening levels.
4,"Claudia Kishi,Live from WSTO is a great book!","Claudia Kishi,Live from WSTO! is #85 in the Babysitters Club series by Ann M.Martin.It doesn't matter if you have never read a BSC book before as everything is explained in each book so you know what is going on!I liked this book as it was quite realistic as they do encounter problems throughout the book."
1,Griffin is another Chomsky! (This is NOT a compliment.),"""FDR planned Pearl Harbor."" ""Bush planned 9/11."" Both conspiracy theories are based on the illogical premise that he who benefits the most politically from an event must have caused that event. This is the same warped thinking behind the conspiracy theory - most popular among some Muslims and Europeans - that Israel and ""the Jews"" were responsible for 9/11 because that attack eventually led the US to invade Iraq, an enemy of Israel. It is also the rationale for the ridiculous belief that the US somehow engineered the recent tsunami. Didn't the US benefit politically by helping the devastated Muslim victims of the tsunami? Therefore the US must have caused the tsunami! David Ray Griffin is another Noam Chomsky. The one is a theologian, the other a linguist. But they are prime examples of experts who should never venture outside their own fields of expertise. The results are laughable. Those who are not laughing don't get the joke."
1,Alleged Distortions,"Griffin's book is an unusual collection of paranoid allegations. The book is, itself, a twisted and somewhat thin conspiracy theory. Even the convoluted presentation of facts lead to his preconceived focus.He has no quams or even moral embarassmett when he offers this book in support of those that deny the reality of terrorism as some would deny the Holocaust."
1,Shame on David,"As a big fan of Griffin's ""Founders of Constructive Post-Modern Philosophy"" I was astonished and saddened by this foray into politics. Since the former book was a collection of other's writings I guess the wool was pulled over my eyes.I expected this to be a serious and scholarly look at the 9/11 Commission report but it is, as it has been dismissed as, ludicrous conspiracy theory written to prop up the waning anti-war crowd. What a shame. Now that Iraq is exercising self determination what will these people latch on to? There isn't anything left.If you want to read Griffin at his best read the book where he only contributed a forwarding essay mentioned above."
5,Why we need a criminal investigation conducted by an Independent Special Prosecutor with unlimited judicial subpoena power ...,David Ray Griffen does it again - exposing the bare lies of the junta's public relations bureau: the 9/11 Commission. Don't miss this book. Griffen cooly and rationally demolishes the Federal Mafia's alibi.
3,Color fades quickly...,"This bumper sticker has such a great color and a great quote too. When it arrived I was very excited. I ordered 2 of them, one for my classroom and one for my car. The one in my classroom has kept its bright fushia color. The one on my car faded so fast, the color was bleached to a rose pink within a month."
5,Beginners and advanced crocheters will benefit,"Clear, concise instructions, both in text and pictures -- including international symbols (and how to read them). Everything is explained several ways so if you don't get one explanation, try another. Beginners can make the stitch sampler afghan, then go on to a full project using favorite stitches. Definitely a book that will help beginners, but advanced crocheters will benefit from great patterns and at least one tip that's new to them. A fine job of laying out this book means advanced folks can easily skip familiar instructions without fear of missing something new. The cost of this book tips the scale to make this a 5 star recommendation."
5,Great book for beginners and experts.,"I have made several of the items in this book. The instructions are the clearest I have seen. This book has the most comprehensive stitch guide I have seen. Patterns include a gorgeous afghan, shawls, hats, scarves, purses, sweaters, and baby things. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in crochet."
2,Outdated,"I got this book for my mom, but most of the patterns were too old-fashioned for even her. She uses it for reference, but never for patterns/designs."
3,A Little Dated,"This book has some very good information, clearly written and is helpful regarding stitches and suggestions, but the projects are, to me, dated either by style or by using yarn that's no longer made. For me, it would have been a better book if the projects had been either more generic or left out entirely. Then it could have been a shorter book -- more of a handbook."
4,Pretty Good Book...,"This book is GREAT for showing lots of stitches, and I really like the idea of making squares of each type of stitch and then making an afghan out of them! The only problem I have with this book is that I have seen at least 3 of the patterns shown in the book in OTHER publications, so I felt a little ""cheated"" on the sweater pattern front.I would like to comment on the above review about the patterns being incorrect...it has been my experience with almost every pattern I have used that at some point what I think the pattern means and what it actually means are different. I just then study the pattern and think through what the designer really meant. Nine times out of ten the pattern was actually correct, just unclear. It is a fault of the crochet shorthand that is used for most every pattern---it is too ambiguous in places."
4,not necessarily for absolute beginners,"This book is beautiful and full of information but I'm afraid it is a bit overwhelming for someone just picking up a hook. They don't even include instructions for a simple granny square, which is why I ordered it."
4,Good reference - don't do the patterns,"I have some experience with crocheting, and was looking for those ever-elusive sweater patterns. Some are a bit weird, but I tried the vest on pg. 168 and the pattern is wrong - I had to unravel and go back. I've seen other references to incorrect patterns, so - beware. The reference part is nice, though."
2,Ugly patterns,"The jacket on the front is interesting, however, they made it reversible. Reversed, it is the ugliest thing I have seen in a long time, it looks like someone skinned a muppet and is wearing it as a jacket. A few of the patterns are cute, but not enough, so I didn't and wouldn't buy this book. If you want to teach someone left-handed crochet, sit in front of them and have them do everything you do, as they see it. I have never found a book that gives good left-hand directions for teaching and doing patterns."
2,Found many mistakes as well,"I wish I had listened to the previous reviews about mistakes in the patterns but there were so many other good reviews I thought - maybe they were wrong. I should have gone with my initial instincts! I'm still working on the 20 square afghan and have had to consult the web constantly to figure out how to do a stitch b/c the book instructions were either wrong or not clear. I'm not sure how the other reviewer finished hers without any problems. Anyway, I enjoyed learning new stitchs but following these instructions were a nightmare. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
2,Too Many Pattern Mistakes,"I consider myself an intermediate level crocheter and I really like a lot of the designs in this book. However, I made the ""Learn to Crochet Afghan"" and found A LOT of mistakes in the instructions. Even some of the basic stitch directions have typos. I'm hesitant to start another project for fear of having to start over due to pattern mistakes."
5,Great value for the entire cycle,"I just want to add that although amazon gives reviews for the 6th and 12th symphonies, this is actually all the symphonies (1rst - 14th), plus two song cycles. 11 Cd's for the price of one is certainly fair."
2,A disorganized disappointment.,"I am a relative novice of calligraphy, and, have of late, purchased several books to work towards improving my skills. This book sounded much better in theory than it was in practice. First of all, it only demonstrate six fonts, and while it certainly examines those six fonts in depth, it is still a rather slim offering. The book is also terribly organized. It jumps around from subjects to fonts to exercises and back again in a manner that is neither user-friendly nor particularly enlightening. While it does a decent job introducing one to some of the basics of calligraphy, it falters when it comes to teaching the art of calligraphy. Look around Amazon, and you are sure to find several better introductory volumes on this enjoyable hobby."
2,None,"We just received our set yesterday and put it together last night. It came packed very well and with no damage. It is a beautiful, well put together, timless piece. However, it is not the color we expected. The stain is a lot more red and darker than it looks online. It's pretty much a cherry finish. The cushions are a tan and sage green pattern with a little bit of gold. I thought they were just two shades of tan from the picture. Even though it isn't what we expected we really love the quality and look. It's a little on the masculine side and the size of the chairs are a bit intimidating. (At 5""5"" when my back is to the back of the chair my feet don't touch the floor.) They are VERY comfortable though. Aside from the color differences, I would definately recommend this set. I can't believe we only paid $819.95 for it! A steal!"
1,Unthinkable,"I am a thirteen year old reader who is simply outraged. Having not read this book, I suppose that I shouldn't be writing this, but I hope you read it anyway. To rewrite such a marvelous book as Hitty is simply scandalous. There is absolutely no point in destroying a masterpiece. The oringinal book is so rich with character. Why should we need to ""update"" a book about a doll that was already old-fasioned from the original publishing date?On principle, I would never read this book."
2,Do classics have to be PC?,"This version of the classic children's book covers roughly the same ground as the original, but the text has been revised and shortened (in spite of the ""new adventures""), and lavish color pictures replace the original black-and-white illustrations. The damage to the text's interest is quite substantial. Although the original Hitty definitely reflected an upper middle class WASP world view, she was a genial doll inclined to think well of those who treated her well, and there is no need to censor her or to strip her and her adventures of their character. The original Hitty is still in print and at a lower price, and I recommend it to all. The only reason to consider this alternative is the illustrations which, although well-done, do not have the charm of Dorothy Lathrop's original drawings."
2,Another dumbed down version,"It was bad enough when they made Nancy Drew stupid, why was it necessary to dumb down Hitty also?! I was stunned to discover this new version of one of my favorite childhood books and more stunned to discover it had been dumbed down considerably. Avoid this one and buy the original instead."
1,If the author knew Hitty...,"If the author really understood the character of Hitty, a real doll for whom Rachael Field wrote imaginary adventures, perhaps she would have written her book with more respect for the original story. The changes she made: (adding an elephant (?) to Phoebe and Hitty's coral beads, making the antique shop where the story ended into a pawn shop, etc. did not make the story easier to understand or more relevant. Any child who can read the adaptation could read the original. The illustrator certainly had never seen the real Hitty, as her doll bent in ways the real Hitty could not. It boils down, in my opinion, to frivolous changes to a story and pictures that need no changes. I would not have objected to a real picture book, with few words, if pictures and words had been faithful to the original and made the book appealing to pre-reading children."
4,"An exellent shortened version, well illustrated.","This children's book should bring even more new fans to Hitty. It is beautifully illustrated and easy reading. I just wish the illustrator had done a bit more research about how Hitty is put together. She show the ends of the pegs inserted through the shoulder and hips, but in the picture of the doll under construction, she has the pegs coming out of the ends of the limbs. A silly mistake!"
5,Don't judge by today's standards,"I am also from MN and have known many religious, from the early 60s through today. During the time represented by this book, those in religious life did not have many options and they were required to give up their life's passion to learn self discipline and ""empty"" themselves. I remember a young woman, a concert pianist, who was required to give up her music for a time. I saw her come into a darkened room and lay her hands on the keyboard cover for a few moments, then quietly leave. You could sense her dispare. These are not the things that those in the religious life speak of to friends and relatives. I believe the book is a beautiful and couragous look at the toll that was taken in some of the young women who gave their lives to God in this way over the centuries. Don't judge methods over 40 years old by today's standards."
3,Good book,Good book even though it was published almost 20 years ago. Pick up a copy at your local library or online through a 'used' book resource. There is some valuable information inside.
3,love seat support,probably would have been good years ago but the sofa is too far gone. It did help a little
4,Does What It Says!,"This device provides adequate support to my too soft love seat. I am more comfortable when I sit in my love seat now. I don't sink into the seat like I did before. It could be a little more supportive, but overall, I am pleased with how the seat feels.It has given new life to my furniture. Good price, also."
1,USE THIS INSTEAD,"I just stacked 2 lids from those big plastic bins I had around the house, shoved them under my couch seat and voila AWESOME support FREE. I'm also reading you can use a sheet of plywood too (make sure it fit's the whole couch bed all the way to the sides (that's where you get the support))I was thinking of buying one of these but decided to use my above trick to ""see"" if I wanted to buy this. With all the bad reviews, I decided I like my trick better plus I didn't have to spend any money.Good luck to you all, nothing worse than a sagging sofa on your back.[...]"
1,Not very happy,The love seat support is too short for the love seat sofa. Had to use the regular sofa support for the love seat. Offer very little support. Use some plywood.
2,sugging love seat support,"It is too short and too narrow, so it does not support at all. I will not buy this one again."
3,It's ok,"It helped a little, but not to my expectations. We still need a little bit more support or new cushions."
2,SAGGING LOVE SEAT SUPPORT,THE PRODUCT DID NOT WORK. MY LOVE SEAT STILL SAGS. I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF CUTTING A PIECE OF PLYWOOD AND PUTTING IT UNDER THE CUSHIONS. SORRY ABOUT THAT
3,Small improvement,I had to buy two of them and double them up on my love seat to get a slight benefit. Hardly worth the money.
3,"If you want something form, fitting this probably isn't it","I've done a few overnight relays and wanted something more fitted this time around. I liked the hook closure and adjustable straps, but the vest bunched up. I think if the overall length of the vest was shorter - maybe mid-chest as opposed to waist-length it would fit better when you cinch the straps to size. If you're looking for an economical option and don't mind a little bulk, this will work just fine. If you're looking for something more fitted, I'd probably look for something else. I also wish there was more reflective material on the back rather than just the one strip toward the bottom."
5,A must have for tortoises,I wasn't sure if I should buy this but I use it every day to serve my tortoise her food. It is shallow and durable. It is good for up to a 4 or 5 inch turtle but the next size up would be better for serving food to a larger tortoise.
5,50 TRACKS FROM THE EMPORER OF EASY,"This is one of those well presented must have compilations for the lounge music enthusiast, Andy Williams at his hippest and coolest. Travel back in time, turn the hi fi down terribly low, and just drift. For that swinging cocktail party or groovy retro pad this is as SMOOTH AS IT GETS. Revel in the finger snapping up tempo 'The House Of Bamboo', 'Spooky', 'Up Up And Away', 'Music To Watch Girls By', 'Happy Heart' and 'Call Me Irresponsible'. Wallow in the mellowness of 'The Shadow Of Your Smile', 'Can't Get Used To Losing You', 'Charade', 'Whistling In The Dark' and the classic 'MacArthur Park'. Above all just sink back in the sofa and enjoy. Robert Rechter. Jan 2002"
4,"Quiet, Lovely","I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and still consider it one of the better finds from that year. As another reviewer has written, nothing much happens in this movie. But if you like a certain kind of foreign film, of the sort like those made by Ozu or Kiarostami, then you'll probably like this movie. It's about the brief intersection of two characters, one worldly and world-weary, lost and casting about for his purpose, and one a young girl just figuring out who she is, having her first crushes on boys, on the verge of emigrating from Hong Kong to Canada. Nothing even remotely romantic ever happens between them, but they manage to become very unlikely friends who bring warmth and kindness to one another during difficult periods in both their lives. It's by no means a typical feel-good film--it's not sentimental in the least. It's a very quiet movie, with a deft touch, but in the end I found it very moving."

4,to people who want a gllimpse into asian culture,"if you want to understand more some of the heritage and the issues facing traditional asia, this is the movie for you. real modern poetry."
4,Really happy with product,"Good product. Bought it before, returned customer. Good service too. Air them out for a while as they have a strong smell."
3,Hard to look at,"I think I bought this book because I read somewhere else that the layout, the organization and presentation of the information was novel, new, perhaps intuitive. I found it very difficult to look at for more than 15 seconds and never tried to ""read"" it for information. I consider myself a fairly visual learner, but this book was beyond me. Perhaps another would have a different experience."
5,unknown taoist classic,"the ""liehtzu"" is the least known of the three most important texts of ancient taoist philosophy (the other two being the ""tao te ching"" and the ""chuangtzu"") and easily the most accessible. the ""liehtzu"" doesn't display much of the rambling riddles of the ""chuangtzu"" and lacks the beautiful, oblique poetry of the ""tao te ching,"" instead choosing to illustrate taoist thought by means of parables and stories. easily the best and most readable guide to a rather slippery philosophy, expertly translated by the always reliable a.c. graham. it's lovely, inspirational, and i've worn my copy thin."
1,horrible,This is NOT made of real plants it is tiny bits of string. I bought several of these wanting realistic movement but they immediately fell apart. they are held together by little more than a metal staple. simply awful.
2,Not up to par for Bevarly,"I have to agree with kcs--this book was wretched. I normally snap up anything by Elizabeth Bevarly, but I couldn't even finish this one. Prudence had NO pride, dignity, or self-respect, and Seth was a jerk. Maybe they developed chemistry later in the book, but I couldn't get past the smarmy dialogue (and monologues) of the first chapters. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that I am giving the author the benefit of the doubt--maybe she had a better book somewhere that she had to butcher to meet a deadline."
5,My Favorite Cook Book,"I absolutely love this book. I have always loved baking but was not very interested in cooking. This book changed the way I think about cooking. The recipes inspired me to be more conscious about eating healthier and encouraged me to try new things. The dishes include a variety of ingredients and if you follow the monthly chapters, you can select recipes which include ingredients that are in season. The best thing is the recipes aren't heavy and fattening, so you can use it every day. I pick 3-4 recipes each week and base my grocery shopping off the required ingredients. I can't say enough nice things about this cookbook and many of my friends have requested recipes based off the meals I have prepared for them."
5,"Very ""Hot"" Read","Wow, Alison has done it again with the next episode of her SG-5 series. Some very sexy and hot sex scenes. The shower scene and the pearls. WOW!"
5,Take Me Down Green River,"Green River rocks and if you don't like it, then you don't know how to. Grunge guitar, soaring vocals, heavy bass and flipped out lyrics. This stuff made me crazy in my bedroom, when I listened to it.It's who Nirvana ripped off and they are on the same label that Soundgarden started from. Rehab Doll, Swallow My Pride, Unwind, classic tracks that nobody can do anymore. This band started something and never got credit for it, but they didn't care they just loved getting down."
4,I was at the show ....,"where the pictures were taken for this album cover. I have my mug on a few of the pictures in the sleeve and on the back. Green River was always better live than in the studio. You had to be there in a tiny club on 4th ave in Seattle that night. What a great show and great memory. This album comes close to capturing what they offered, but doesn't capture the energy and vitality of their shows. Buy this and dream that you were there that night (and many others) swilling beers and getting high. Those were the days when the Seattle music scene was ignored and the opportunity was provided for the local music scene to develop without interference from outside media sources."
4,drunken fathers of gunge,"this band however very important to the seattle movement was good but alot of the vocals by mark arm on this album are irritating, there is no melody, id have to say that i only listen to the rehab doll part of the album because dry as a bone sounds too much like some drunken garage band, i would recomend however come on down by green river instead"
2,Not a Mike Arm voice fan,"You can understand that Gossard and Ament were beginning to define a new Seattle sound so that's the cool thing of this album, but I cannot say the same thing of Arm's voice. His voice wasn't that good and sometimes tends to be annoying -to me-. I don't know it's just that I can't appreciate a single song as a whole because of this. Good album to have it in your collection but not within my favorites."
2,Good CD but Most of the Tracks Are Mislabeled,"I usually oppose giving bad ratings for the product as opposed to the music but Amazon screwed up on this one. Its a good CD (a compilation of what is essentially the earliest recordings of the grunge movement) but all of the tracks that have the artist listed as ""Soundgarden"" are actually either bonus tracks or from the Dry as a Bone half of the CD. Check it out, but Amazon, fix the screw-ups."
2,"Smile Politely And Bear It, Gals","You know I actually got this given to me as a birthday present?There's nothing exactly harmful in these jokes but I wish the rest of the world knew how if you have blond hair you hear about one blonde joke a week and have your whole life and it does get old. I once saw a book called ""Dumb Blonde's Revenge: Jokes About Brunettes"" and it wasn't funny and I couldn't imagine giving that to one of my dark-haired friends or even telling those jokes in front of one of them. I wonder what it is about blonde jokes that makes them stick around like they do decade after decade? Who knows.Oh, um, this book, by the way? Yeah, as far as reviews, it's got all the blonde jokes every blonde has already heard fifty times. If that amuses you, go for it, otherwise, give it a rest or better yet make up something new, eh? Now if you'll excuse me I gotta white-out my typos on the computer screen."
5,Top dead center,"If you have not yet developed an ear for the avant garde and consider the big band swing a bit old fashioned; than this is exactly where you need to begin. This is a great set list by the best talent that world of jazz had to offer. This is hot and tempermental riffing. Once you get these grooves under your skin, then you can reach even further back into the America's past or explore the places where you thought your ears would never go."
5,Jack Nicholson,"If you are looking for a film that has no ""fx"" and also no ""over the top"" Jack Nicholson ,try "" King of Marvin Gardens"" You can see glimpses of pre casino "" Atlantic City"". Along with Bruce Dern, as Nicholson,s brother, this film examines just how disconnected from reality certain ""apparently mainstream"" folks are. Ellen Burstyn delivers a haunting performance. Unlike many films of today, this film has a real script and devilishly good acting..involving a very downbeat subject."
4,Who says Hollywood doesn't make foreign films?,"This plays like a European art film, with slow action, moody sets, depressive topics and thoughtful acting. This 1972 Jack Nicholson movie came out when he was getting hot after ""Easy Rider"" and ""Five Easy Pieces."" The director, Bob Rafaelson, was one leader of a new American cinema movement. I doubt this was much of a hit, but it remains a gem in the filmographies of all concerned. The Atlantic City shot here is gone now, replaced by casinos. The deserted boardwalk, empty grand old hotels and junky stores are captured for eternity. The plot is a family drama. You are never sure who is the craziest one here. It could be any or all of them. Very slow moving story line, but it raises questions and makes you think more than the average Hollywood movie, then and now."
5,Against the struggled reality: evasive dreams!,"Against the struggled reality: evasive dreams!Two brothers share a same dream; to live in an island paradise where they will both kings once they have retired; one of them is a bewildered man product of the inscrutable fate, the other the great swagger, the unexhausted dream machine who certainly swears he is a small entrepreneur. The long late night radio monologue is the standout of the film."
2,Early '70s pretentious slop for the most part,"Nicholson is a depressive, retrospective bore with a slick brother living in Atlantic City.The movie starts off with a little promise, but ambles along like a bad rash, never reallygoing anywhere. It's a movie about losers finding themselves (or re-discovering themselveswith Dern and Nicholson) and going nowhere. I find most of the characters annoying, especiallyBurstyn's. Waste of time."
2,sorry,I sent this to my grandaughter thinking that is the stroller were made by corolle it must be a quality item. unfortunately the front wheel kept falling off. The stroller got returned after a week to the disappointment of my four year old grandaughter.
1,Really ridiculous staging,"I have to agree fully with a previous reviewer that the staging--apparently based on what costumes and sets were available in a seedy thrift shop--is truly awful and makes a mockery of Purcell's fine work. I'm not adverse to modernized (or in this case heavily postmodernized) stagings, but this production has to take the cake as the worst example of the genre I've seen in the last 30 years (do not be fooled, as I was, by the somewhat traditional look of the cover to this DVD). Harnoncourt has been something of a hero to me owing to his pioneer work using period instruments and due to the brilliance of his musical interpretations, and the work is well-played. But there is no excuse I can see for this production, and while I try to write only positive reviews, this DVD needs a warning label: NOT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE PURCELL."
2,Brandy Obligatory,The music is sublime. The staging is tiresome trash. I barely managed the first disc. I needed much brandy to sit through the second. Luckily you can set the DVD to show only the music part. And I did that with the second disc. A true waste of money. Avoid.
1,Arthur's Third Reich?,"This is the worst bastardization of a musical work I've ever seen. I've tried to watch it twice and couldn't get beyond Act I either time. That the libretto is in German is not as bad as the fact that the so-called singers scream their lines at each other across minimalist stage settings wearing costumes salvaged from Willie Wonka & The Longest Day. Now I know the Salzburg Opera is no fan of National Socialism but the way this production comes out it more resembles an air on the ""Horst Wessel Lied"" than anything written by Henry Purcell. Were Purcell alive and witness to this farce he'd draw his rapier and go after the whole crowd responsible."
5,ESSENTIAL DEATHROCK!,"The worlds most artistic underground music scene Christian Death is....by far...one of the most important bands in the deathrock/goth-rock scene that also fuses to post-punk, etc., but simply put...great album. Very goth, very dark, very raw, and most people hate it but of course goths love the hell out of it."
4,Secret Concealer review,"I have dark circles under my eyes, and was looking for something that works good to cover the shadows under there. I tried this product, and it seemed to work real nicely. It brightens up the eyes, however I do find myself re-touching alot. I do like the emolliency of the product, and I was also really pleased how the seller added a Laura Mercier blue/black pencil eye liner, and a sample face wash. Thumbs up! And thank you!"
3,Good coverage but needs secret brighting powder,"In search of good coverage, color and staying power, I have tried at least 8 concealers. This is one of the best - however, it probably needs secret brightening powder ($22) to set it and brighten the area. Two different Laura Mercier people told me I have the correct color, but it's kind of dark (or the same color as my face)and kind of makes me look ill so I'm going to try it with the brightener. Overall, if you have the right color, it covers REALLY well and stays on most of the day. A tiny bit goes a long way, so it will last a while. If you feel like it's drying or looks cakey, put moisturizer or eye primer on first."
3,Have Used It Four Years . . .,but it's always been a bit sticky to deal with. You need to let it warm up on your fingers before using the heavy concealer and the lighter concealer slips a bit. I've just switched to Becca because of it's good reviews. What I really need is a plastic surgeon to fix the dark circles !
1,Too Dark,Disappointed in the color. It actually made mydark circles darker. It seemed very heavy when I barely applied it. Will not buy this brand of makeup again.
4,Good product,"I use Laura mercier tinted moisturizer so I thought I'd try the under eye concealer. I like it a lot. It's creamy, blends in well with my tinted moisturizer and stays put. All in all, a good product."
1,"Unfortunately, not an improvement","A previous reviewer said that what this re-mix of Protection lacks is the original's beauty. I would agree with that, and add that it also lacks its harmony. In fact, No Protection is a rather discordant piece of work; more often than not, the Mad Professor's overlaid dubs don't match the underlying music's tempo, creating a rather uncomfortable listening experience. What Mad Professor failed to do here was take the languid, fragile harmonies running through Protection and build on them. Instead, he bulldozes them over with random blips, beats, and vocal snippets, leaving us nothing but rubble to enjoy. Save yourself a headache and don't buy this album."
2,wasted effort,"The original of this album was 'Protection' and was excellent, though perhaps not as good as their brilliant first album 'Blue lines' or their 3rd 'Mezzanine'. However this remix by Mad Professor blurs the vocals, particularly the wonderful title track Protection sung by Tracy Thorn (of Everything but the Girl) and adds little to Massive Attacks clear sound and clear social commentary. A must for collectors only or those who don't like lyrics.All others; buy the other Massive Attack albums first"
1,No Connection,"""Protection"" was Massive Attack`s worst record, but this remix album is even worse, destroying the few interesting moments that the band`s second effort had. Remixer Mad Professor deconstructs the songs and gives them a dub/ reggae-oriented sound, something that`s decent enough during the first two/ three tracks but soon becomes terribly uninspired, repetitive, boring and formulaic.There are no variations or contrasts in this remixes, the process is always the same and the album seems endless, almost impossible to listen through in one sitting while managing to remain awake. Seriously, this is a major disappointment, and certainly one of the most monotonous, one-dimensional and flat records around.For fans and completists only."
2,Dub not = dubstep,"I much prefer the original versions of these songs. I was expecting a more dubstep sound, and this is dub. The fault for my negative reaction lies in my musical ignorance of the distinction between those genres. However, I still only gave this two stars because I really didn't like it, and if people only rate things they like then the ratings end up inflated."
5,sounds good,"off the samples and reviews, i'm sold!sounds like a mellow groove freak your mama for an hour tape.i can't wait to get the cd, blaze 1, and talk about love."
3,Where's my copy of the original?,"The mixing of the vocals, particularly on track one, ruins this cd for me. Should have left it a non-vocal dub and avoid the reverb and echos. Remixes just don't always work. Buy the original releases!"
2,Only if you are a big fan of dub,"All of the remixes on this CD are done the same way. Mad Professor seems to do the exact same thing to every song. Don't bother with remxing if you aren't going to bring anything new to the recording. The take on Protection is interesting, but it does take from the strengths of that song. Beautiful love song vocals over a heavy hip hop beat. Professor strips the vocals to minimum.Can't recommend it, unless you really like dub."
2,D-U-L-L,"I really enjoy dub, from the old-school Trojan stuff up through Burning Spear, LKJ, etc., and I have a couple Mad Professor CDs. While sometimes overly busy, both have some fun, interesting stuff. I'd heard that ""No Protection"" bears little resemblance to ""Protection."" No problem, I thought, it'll be fun to check out what the Mad Professor brings to the project. Inexplicably, he abandons his usual kitchen-sink approach, and what we get here is dishwater-dull. The first few tracks are enjoyable, melllll-ow ear candy. The rest is aural wallpaper. (The last song is an absolute waste of time, but you'll likely be asleep by then.) Buy this only if you're looking for something to crash to."
5,Dub Madness - Expertly Produced,"I'll take this album over PROTECTION any day as the latter sounds almost boring in comparison. Flying tablas, breathing atmospheres, 2-ton beats . . . put this on and just groooove, baby! It's a trip."
3,Not a Winner,I relied upon the reviews posted after I started the book. By the way the reviews on Amazon written by readers are better in my view than most one reads by professionals. I agree that the book is a great page turner in the beginning because the premise is terrific. The problem is that there is not a satisfying or believable resolution. The other disappointment is that Baldacci at his best develops memorable characters such as in Absolute Control or the Winner. In this book none of the characters grew or surprised.If you have not read Baldacci before do not start with this one. If you have read his others prepare for having fun but the book will not measure up.
3,"Good start, weird finish","Being a native Virginian, I'm a big David Baldacci fan. This book starts out great. The action and plot are gripping. Then about 3/4 into the book, the story bogs down,and becomes difficult to trudge through. Perhaps one problem is the use of too many characters to follow. I had a hard time keeping characters straight. The final 1/4 of the book takes some bizarre (if not unbelievable) turns. Overall, not a bad read."
5,Kept me reading all day long,"This is the first novel of David Baldacci's that I have read. As such, it was surprising captivating.Usually, when a novel says ""You won't put it down"", I have little to no problem doing just that. ""Split Second"" kept me reading and reading, feeling a need to find just who was behind what I was reading about.It was also refreshing to have a book where the killer isn't revealed right away, and you know all of their motives, etc. I figured out who, maybe 2/3 of the way through, but still didn't know why, or how it would play out in the end.I will definitely be reading more by Baldacci."
2,Embarrassing,"A secret service agent hottie who also wins olympic medals? A secret service agent studmuffin with a rough exterior and a heart of gold? A sneaky villian who tells everything about their evil plot in the end? A bond forming between these two agents as they chase the sneaky villain? An action thriller that uses such descriptive adjectives as ""murderous"" and ""deadly"" on seemingly every page instead of actually taking the time to examine actions and motivations?Yes, dear reader, all this awaits you in this bestselling piece of pabulum from our very un-original sissy thriller writer, David Baldacci. If it seems like you have read it all before and better, you have. But remember, this heroine (with the unfortunate name of Michelle Maxwell) wins olympic medals."
3,NOT A SECOND TOO SOON !!,"OK the plot was implausible, but it kept me entertained on a long flight to a business meeting.This was my first read of DB and it certainly was action packed. I rather liked Sean King, Michelle Maxwell and got a big kick out of Joan, the spider woman!!It certainly kept my interest (after acknowledging ""hope this couldnt be real"") and surprised me with a couple of twists and turns. Will certainly try to find the next book which teams Sean and Michelle again as they form their own PI agency. Hope the plot will be a little more realistic and not for the sake of an improbable wrong."
5,Another great book by Balcacci!,"I am a big fan of David Baldacci. I have read all his books and have found that most of them are really good reads. I particularily enjoyed ""Split Second"" and found it to be one of the best Baldacci books."
4,Good thriller,"I liked getting know how Sean and Michelle eneded up where they are today. As others have pointed out, the end was a little far fetched, but getting there was a fun ride."
1,Skip This One,"This is by far the stupidest, most ridiculous plot ""reveal"" I've ever read. And getting there was no picnic either. The characters are cliches from a romance novel, the plot developments are so senseless and disconnected that they're just boring, and the author's ""suspenseful"" device of having his characters figure out critical facts but not revealing it to the reader until much later is just plain annoying. By the time I was halfway through the book, I really wanted to stop. But I guess I have OCD about finishing books I start, because I forced my way through to the bitter end -- and bitter it was. Baldacci's a popular writer, and I enjoyed Absolute Power, so he's probably written many worthwhile novels. But in my reasonably humble opinion, this isn't one of them."
4,"Slow start, but very enjoyable read!","I would recommend this book! It was interesting and after the first 50 pages, a good paced story. I wish it had started with a little more punch, but I enjoy Baldacci's writing style and his characters are always interesting. The web he weaves in his storyline keep you guessing until the end."
5,SPLIT SECOND IS A WORK OF ART FROM DB,"SPLITreally like the characters, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. keeps you on the edge of your pages.leaves you wanting more of these 2 crime fighters.really liked it"
1,Total waste if time,If an author has to reach this far to try to keep his publisher happy then he should just go fishing. Unbelievable is the word that best describes this waste if paper. Reading this review gives the book too much attention.
3,Good except for the end,"I am not a Baldacci fan but I started this book and it got my interest - in fact it kept it until the very end when all was revealed - what a clunker! None of it makes sense and is one of the stupidest, out there finales I have read in awhile. I don't know why a good read had to end up so pathetially but it does. The three stars are for about 280 pages and then it is downhill from there. What a waste of my time and I agree with another reviewer who called the killer a cartoon character -the killer was all that and worse. Save your money and time."
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with theis book. I read the cover and inside & thought it sounded like it would keep my interest. I couldn't wait to finish only to get it over with because it was boring. Those that thought it was so good should read books by Harlan Cohen. He is an author and you can't put his books down.
2,Baldacci needs a break,"Too many novels in too short a time span , this Balducci novel is not worth it at all. Too far fetched , too unreal. It seems as though the author was painstakingly trying to end the story , when in fact it ended before the 100th page. Take a pass on Baldacci for awhile."
3,Thanks for Michelle Maxwell,"As an aspiring female Federal Agent myself, I appreciated the character of Michelle Maxwell. Most authors write about Joan's in federal law enforcement. Thank you for the breath of fresh air in Michelle's character.This was my first Baldacci read. I enjoyed the speed, the suspense and the genre. I do have to agree with other posters - some of the twists or characters introduced were a bit confusing. Still don't know the purpose of Bob Scott? But I enjoyed it for a purely entertaining mystery!"
2,Not his best,I was disappointed with this book. I always look forward to reading his latest but found this one lacking. Don't waste your time on this one. Read Absolute Power. It's his best.
2,Convoluted and confusing,"I, too, have been a big Baldacci fan. But, this book left me cold!!! The first half of the book was compelling reading. But, there were so many characters after awhile, that it took great concentration to keep them straight. For that reason, it became rather slow reading. The ending was very unbelievable, ridiculous, and confusing. I struggled to finish because I just didn't care anymore. I'm sorry I actually purchased the book instead of using the library. I have greatly enjoyed his other books, so I know he can do better."
1,A waste of time and money,"Having read and liked Absolute Power, Saving Faith, and other of Baldacci's books, and some of the reviews on the Internet, I was really disappointed. This one is a total waste of money and time.Baldacci lets the characters talk too much about obvious conclusions and then neglects to drop any real hints. The mystery of the villain's identity was a laughable cliché. The main shallow characters, the unconvincing dialogue, the investigators' far-fetched deductions that just happens to be true are all together insulting to the readers' intelligence.This smells of a way for the author to make a quick buck and I don't think I'll buy another Baldacci book again. It is one of the lousiest books I've read in a long time and I read two to three books a week in this very genre. It went straight into the waste paper basket after I finished it."
2,The Difference between cooking and writing,"When cooking or following a recipe, there are few constraints. When writing a formula novel, there are many constraints. In addition to the author's work, the editor and the agent have specific constraints. We must have action, we don't need character development. We must have action, we don't need insight into the cardboard characters.The Gaussian curve applies to writers as well as coin tosses. This author is not at the top end of the curve. Ah well, there's always Charles Dickens."
2,An insult,"David Baldacci used to be a GREAT author, one whose work I would patiently look forward to. After reading his last two books before this one (The Christmas Train and Last Man Standing) I promised myself I would forever skip over any future books from him. I caved in. I gave him one another chance. A stupid move. Very stupid. About as stupid as this book. This book is so incredibly contrived and far-fetched, that I'm insulted that he would think we would buy into it even for a few evening's readings. Save yourself your time. Save yourself your money. But more importantly, save yourself the anger you'll experience after reading this book and realizing you were taken for an idiot. There are far better books out there to spend your time on. Oh, and David: ""Never again!"""
1,"Man, What a Stinker!","This book holds your attention for a little longer than a split second; say 5 minutes. That's time enough for what could have been a promising political thriller to devolve into a thuddingly dull revenge caper/laughable romance tale. And the ending! Straight out of the ""Mad? I'm not mad! It's the world that's mad! Muwahahah!"" school of TV-movie villany. As with most later Baldacci novels, the dialogue and character interaction are painfully forced and cliched to boot. Skip this one unless you're truly addicted to the author's work, and even then you may be tempted to enter a 12-step program afterwards."
5,The best book I've read for a long time!,I absolutely loved this book!! Baldacci ia a genius! The ending will satisfy every reader. I definetly recomend this book to everyone!
2,What an ending!,"Most of the reviews I've read here by other customers seem like they only read the first half of the book. I'm a big Baldacci fan, a big mystery/suspense fan and I really enjoyed the first half of this book...maybe even the first three quarters of it. But the ending and plot unveiling is just so ludicrous, so insipid and so filled with ""who gives a damn"" moments that this book went from a 5 to a 2 in about 20 pages. Very disappointing."
2,"a good book, until...","I'm a fan of Baldacci's books. This one is a real page turner and you spend a good moment, until you arrive after de 2/3 of the book. Then you realize something is wrong with the story, that is a bit artificial... This feeling is confirmed by one of the most ridiculous ""end-revelation-solution"" that I have read in my life. I told myself: ""He's kidding""... But no, Baldacci is not kidding."
1,Poorly written disappointment,"I am a big fan of Baldacci's other books. Not this one. Split Second combines horrible dialogue, a ridiculously improbable story line, and an absurdly laughable ending. I would not recommend it to anyone. I finished it only because my wife said I had to read the ending because I would not believe it made it into a book. If you have to read a Baldacci right now, re-read Absolute Power."
2,Not David's best,"An OK book, but I found myself lost several times and had to flip back and forth to refresh my memory on certain people. And also, what's with the psycho running circles over and over again around two highly trained Secret Service agents? I just had a hard time buying into that one.I'm not sure what David was goign for in this book. ""Last Man Standing"" kept me rivited, one of the best books I've ever read, but he really seems fall a bit flat on character development in this book. I would like to have seen an extra 100 pages to bring more personality to the novel."
2,Not usual Baldacci,"I'm a big fan of Baldacci's and to say he writes real page-turners is an understatement. He's one of the very best. Great characters, great stories. He obviously does extensive research for his novels. Unfortunately, however, Split Second does not live up to his prior good works. Actually, everything is okay until you near the end when it gets quite improbable and the ending itself is just ridiculously goofy - almost laughable, in fact."
1,Poor,"I read nearly the entire book, but just could not get myself to finish. I loved his previous books, but this one was a bust."
2,Certainly not up to par,"Not the quality of writing that Baldacci has exhibited in his earlier books. This read like one long very confusing and unbelievable conversation. As another reviewer said, when spread out over multiple sittings, the plot became more tangled in your mind. In the end, we are supposed to believe that all of the events that happened were for the purpose of fulfilling one man's fantasy. All in all, the book just didn't read right. I don't think David Baldacci can honestly say this was his best effort. Don't waste your money; if you must read it, get it from the library or the used books section. It's selling there for 33 cents; that's about what it's worth."
1,Couldn't believe it!!,"I am such a huge fan of David Baldacci that I don't even bother to read the synopsis on the book jacket, I just buy the book. Not any more! I slogged my way through this poorly written, unbelievable plot. By the time I got to the last chapters I was speed reading just to say I finished it. My daughter asked me if I liked it. I told her it was as if he wrote it in college and no one would publish it so he waited until he was a bestselling author and dug it out of the closet, dusted it off and his editor jumped on it. Next book he writes I'll check it out of the library just in case he's got more junk in that closet."
1,Don't Bother With This Book,"Split Second is by far David Baldacci's worst book. When he is right on, he is one of the best. But this book is so full of trite, overwrought dialogue and cheesy situations, that I almost couldn't pick it up. This book reads like a contract filler--he had to write a book, didn't care about anything but the money, and cranked out a tepid, hackneyed piece of tripe.Believe it or not, I am a Baldacci fan when he is focused. His ""Wish You Well"" is a beautifully crafted bit of heartfelt fiction. The writing is clean and precise, and the dialogue flows beautifully. Split Second is not. It reads like a second- rate first attempt by a mediocre writer. It is sorely disappointing.My only hope is that he has made enough money from the sales of this turkey that he can spend the time to write to the level he has already demonstrated that he can achieve."
5,Wow! Could not put it down.,I had read this book a couple of years ago and liked it then and recently read it again. It seems like it was better the second time around. Could not put it down.I love how the whole story just seemed to tie in to the conclusion.You will enjoy it.
3,Good story until the rediculous ending!,"This was a really interesting story. Wonderful political plot with endless possibilities as to who the true villan might be. Once I got toward the end and the villan and his motives were revealed, what a bummer! This was lame, lame, lame. Is that the best he could do? Not at the top of my most recommended reads for the summer!"
3,A good book that ends badly,"I enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it as long as you're willing to overlook a bad ending. The story line is suspensful, the characters are engaging, and the reasearch behind the plot is solid. That part gets 5 stars. And then came the end, and I closed the book saying ""I can't believe Baldacci wrote such a good book and then came up with such a ridiculous ending."" Go ahead and read this one, but be ready to tread lightly at the end."
2,"Baldacci said, ""Let there be a Split Second"", and ...","... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another ""blockbuster"" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending."
5,superb as all his books are!,"He has such a distinctive style and has you virtually spellbound throught the book, he paints such and inclusive picture!"
3,Not a thriller,I found that there were too many characters popping up in unexpected locales to keep the story line straight. The ending was not amazing nor breath-taking. I did like the hero and suspect he might show up again in another mystery.
4,Maxwell & King meet,"I'd be hard pressed to tell you if Maxwell and King or The Camel Club would be #1 with me. Suffice it to say if Baldacci writes it you MUST read it. This book is how Maxwell and King meet - it's government coverups, murder most foul and other heart racing goodies. I seem to be reading these books in a reverse order - doesn't matter because the content is always worth the price of admission. Good book for beach or an air conditioned room. Enjoy!"
2,Waste of time,"Starts of well, but then peaks around the middle, its almost as if Baldacci started with a brilliant story but couldn't figure a brilliant way to end it. Hence we have the ridiculous plot and totally childish and incredulous ending...Skip."
2,A fun bit of fluff,"The book grabbed me from the start -- it had suspense, conspiracy, interesting characters, etc. Somewhere around the middle it lost speed, and by the end I was shaking my head in disgust. Sorry. The best part of the book was getting an ""inside"" look at how the Secret Service works. I'm not sure how much of this was made up by Mr. Baldacci, but if you're interested in getting a (fictional) account of the Service, you will enjoy Split Second."
2,"Couldn't finish it, and I read 3 books a week","I never got interested in the characters, they didn't seem real and the plot wasn't believable. Plus, almost everybody gets bumped off or kidnapped as soon as they are introduced. The great mystery of the ""elevator distraction"" was a big plot flop and I found it to be annoying. I couldn't understand why we had the reason for that fatal distraction withheld until so late in the book.The only reason the main character (an ex-secret service agent) is a lawyer is because that's what Balducci writes about.This book is a who dunnit, but I never cared who dunnit. It seems to be the result of the pressure put on successful authors to crank out more books."
2,Split Second,"I was looking for a ""page turner"" from an author who had been a best seller. It was very good until I was about 75% through it. Then, he began to mix so many characters and plots that it became confusing. I couldn't keep everything straight from the time I put it down for a couple of days until I finally finished. A real disappontment!"
2,Brutally terrible writing,"The plot kept my interest, but the writing is just brutal. The dialogue made me gnash my teeth. Just brutal."
3,Good entertainment if not for the bad ending,"I really liked the novel until the final. It doesn't let you put the book down and, therefore, it's a good mistery thriller. Oh, if only the ending would make any sense. Unfortunately, there is no logic whatsoever in how everything is explained in the end. And just because the bad guy is crazy as the author implies it doesn't mean that his actions shouldn't have any reasonable explanations. Besides, I found main characters not to be really beleivable. Still, keeps you reading."
3,Not Baldacci's Best By a Long Shot,This is a convoluted tangle that doesn't do Baldacci justice. It has too many parts that just don't hold up. Read Saving Faith and Absolute Power instead!
3,Wait for this in paperback,"If David Baldacci had found a better way to conclude this book, I would have rated it much higher. As it is, I thought it was an interesting mystery. Two Secret Service agents are involved in a violent act being carried out against the people they were sworn to protect. One is assasinated. Sean King is the agent on that one. One is abducted. Michelle Maxwell is in charge of that one. Eight years seperates the two acts. Yet, the acts are linked and more people are about to die as the two agents start investigating the incidents and start turning up rocks that people don't want moved. There are numerous suprises and many things are not what they seem. I liked the book, but I did not love it. Maybe you want to wait for the paperback issue."
2,This Baldacci fan was very disappointed.,"He is one of my favorite, and although this looks like an exciting book, it was actually boring and even dumb! I was really disappointed. I hope his next is better."
3,Ditto,"I agree that the book grabs and holds your attention at the beginning, but Sean King and ex-girlfriend Joan's sarcasm was intolerable. They both should have an attitude adjustment! And jeez, King and Maxwell are clearly attracted to each other but spend weeks working together without as much as a hug ... are they human??? The plot is confusing with all the wild ""whodunit"" speculation from the four major characters. The ending was highly disappointing in that the villian had less than believable motive for such absurd crimes. I am a Baldacci fan and will read again, but the writer must have worn himself out on all the twists and turns and had to finish the last few chapters in his sleep."
3,Very disappointing ending... A shame...,"What the heck was Dave thinking to end this otherwise excellent story they way he ended it ? I am only giving it three stars because the first 3/4 of the story would keep you breathless and guessing....until you get the the final four chapters...The ending is - for the lack of a better word - dumb...Words 'totaly implausible' and 'extremely far-fetched' don't even begin to cut it...It's like he ran out of his imagination and figured it was time to wrap it up with a completely insanely unrealistic finale..I feel almost like David went to Maui for some long needed R&R; while his maid sneaked in, took a peek and finished the story to her simpleton liking...The ending stands apart from the rest of the story and makes it feel detached... But David Baldacci is the master storyteller, no doubt."
3,"too complicated, too many peripheral minor characters","The main characters were interesting & well-developed. The focus on Secret Service agents on presidential candidate protection details is a nice touch. However, the plot is too complicated & implausible, and there are too many vaguely-defined peripheral characters to make this book a hands down winner.I read quite a bit, and I had a hard time following the plot in this one. Even in the final pages, where the villian explains his entire scheme & motive, things didn't become clear, or the least bit convincing.this isn't one to put down & pick up again later -- it's too easy to forget where you are & which of the many peripheral characters are involved. It would be a decent fast-paced read best consumed in a single setting, with one's full attention."
2,BALDERDASH,"An overwritten crime story. Cardboard characters. An over complicated story line. Flat and predictable dialogue.Far out, unbelievable, motivations, and incredible criminal events.Totally non involving. Boring, boring, boring.Wish I had the 5 hours ( wasted on the book )back.Sorry that I seem so wishy, washy in my evaluation."
1,"Third-rate Plotting, Fourth-rate Writing","Once upon a time, I enjoyed Baldacci's works. That was before he became famous. Now he's content to live off his reputation. Ludicrous plot sloppily assembled with the kind of wording reminiscent of the underachiever in high school composition class. Appalling."
4,I liked it,"I briefly scanned the 90 reviews and what I found was either 1) readers loved this book or 2) they hated it because they couldn't remember the characters involved. I'll try not to be to harsh to the latter group, but I was able to follow along and thought that Baldacci did a great job keeping me from accurately guessing who the bad guys were. Enjoy the book!!"
3,Average Mystery Novel,"There was nothing that stands out in this novel, whether it be positive or negative. The story is about two Secret Service agents, each who have lost a charge in the line of duty, who team up and learn that their two incidents are possibly related, despite the eight year time difference. The characters and story were not nearly as engrossing as those in Last Man Standing. The dynamic between the main characters provided for some entertainment and there were a few actions sequences that were exciting. However, in the end this books becomes off as nothing more than an average mystery thriller. Last Man Standing is a much better novel, and fans of that book may be disappointed with this effort. However, devoted Baldacci fans may nevertheless find this an exciting read."
2,strangely poor,"Baldacci seemed to have found the perfect mix of character/plot and action in his novels but this book has none of the usual characteristics that one would associate with the author. If his name was not on the cover you would not have guessed that it was him!Weak characters and a story that had potential and ends up being quite dull with an ending that is almost laughable.Sorry, but is is a bad one from a normally reliable and top notch author."
4,Holds one's interest,Have read most of David Baldacci's books but this one seems to have held my interest throughout the entire book. I finished reading the book in a very short time just so I could read more as to how this mystery would be solved. I will be reading more of this author's books in the future.
3,Not his best work.,"I normally enjoy the books by David Baldacci and this one wasn't bad, it just wasn't all that good either. I was a little worried when, early in the story, a mystery person was driving a Buick Impala. E-edition editing problem maybe?The story tried to tie together two Secret Service Agents from two different incidents, over different presidential campaigns. It was pretty convoluted. Throughout the story, with all the characters that were involved, the investigations leading nowhere or to other questions, the bad guys were ahead--outsmarting and out maneuvering the good guys. Not only was that kind of frustrating, but I figured out who the mastermind was way before our intrepid heroes. The ending was weird and illogical. Why would anyone go to that much trouble for no appreciable gain?I'll probably read more by Baldacci, but this one was a bit disappointing."
2,Boring,I thought this book was a bit disjointed. Too many twists to absorb and it didn't help that the characters were quite boring. I didn't find myself attached to any of the characters and therefore didn't care what happened to any of them.
1,This book was a serious waste of my time!,"I love Baldacci's books, but this one really turned me off. There were times I wanted to just throw it and even more so at the end. What scares me, is he is talking about writing a sequel with these characters, which the characters are fine, but will the next story improve. I sure hope so and I am afraid to give it a chance as this one was so frustrating."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of David Baldacci, I looked forward to this book after ordering it from Amazon. The premise was fine, but there was no real character development, there was at least one embarrassing lapse in logic (spoiler warning: when the agents suspected Jorst had hidden the gun, they never thought it through with regard to the two women who were killed), and the end was way, way too far-fetched. Like another reviewer said, the villain was an impossible cartoon, and worse, his motivation for doing all that he did was just lame. I won't even be lending this book to anybody."
1,Don't waste your money,"You can hear the plot machinery creaking from miles away. The conclusion of this book is so bizarre and so contrived that it lacks only the direct intervention of bug-eyed monsters from outer space. If this is all it takes to write a best-seller, lead me to my computer!The characters are non-compelling and poorly sketched.Bottom line? I actually paid for this book? Shame on me."
1,laughable,"I do not expect mysteries to be great literature necessarily, but I do expect the ultimate denouement to be at least somewhat comprehensible and credible. This one was neither. The denoument of this plot was utterly contrived. It was absurd, and lacked any and all credibility. It was actually laughable. I feel cheated, having wasted my time reading this whole book only to be met with such a cheap ending."
1,No Option for Zero Stars?,"I am a Balducci fan. I have read half I dozen of his books and enjoyed them all. Until now. No, this is not the worst book I have ever read. But it is close.Plot is important. Great characters and story telling will not keep a poor story afloat.The story started with a bang and just kept building through the first half of the book. Then I started to wonder how Balducci was going to pull it all together in the end. Not well it turns out. The crazy guy did it. Peoples lives ruined over a period of thirty years and presidential candidates falling left and right and the reason is.....unrequited love. I wish I was kidding.The bad taste this book has left me may keep me from ever trying Balducci again. It was that bad."
1,"after a good start, this fades fast","The start of this book grabbed me right away. Two secret service agents who failed to protect their political candidates are brought together with a chance to right their past wrongs. Good concept! This mystery-thriller was filled with twists and turns, and with each one, the book became more and more far fetched. I'm more than happy to suspend belief in a page-turning thriller, but this book went so far over the edge, the ending was truly laughable. One of my all time favorite thrillers is Baldacci's Absolute Power. Nothing else I've read of his comes close to that. This is by far the worst. If you enjoyed Absolute Power and want more Baldacci, my advice is to get the audiobook of Absolute Power. It's fun to listen to as well. Regarding Split Second, it is ironically named. The story really dragged. I think I'm done with this author."
4,Riveting,"Riveting is a good descriptive word for this book, as you will not want to put it down. Action packed and full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing."
3,Split Second - Baldacci,"This is my 7th Baldacci and although it is OK, it does not match up to the others.A little laborious in places but good reading nonetheless."
4,Exciting,Keeps the readers interest. I am glad I discovered this author on Amazon.I plan to read many of Baldacci's books.
1,horrible,"Baldacci, is a bad writer, all his production except the very first one (Absolute Power, which was average) was well below average, but this one is truly beyond the pale. The character presentation is so naive, that one would suspect that the author is still struggling through the high school."
2,The worst Baldacci book I've read,I am a big fan of Baldacci but I just finished this one today & must say i was disappointed. I found myself skimming the last 1/3 of the book just so I could finish it.The beginning was good & I couldn't put it down! I was really looking forward to a nice complex entertaining story but it just got too hard to follow & really just boring.The ending was just ridiculous....very implausible & almost laughable. What a disappointment.I can't believe this got more stars than Absolute Power & Saving Faith???
3,Not his best,A potentially interesting story that gets bogged down with way too many characters. If you decide to buy this book also consider buying a legal pad so you can keep track of the players.
3,""" A Split Decision ""","Secret Service Agent Sean King looks away for a ""Split Second"" and his Presidential Candidate is shot and killed. Nine years later Agent Michelle Maxwell's Candidate is kidnapped when she has a momentary lack of judgement. In the Sercret Service these two agents become known for all the same bad reasons, but do these events have more in common than what appears on the surface? They join together to find out.This story has good characters, some romance, lots of action, and lots of excitment, but as the plot thickens it gets too thick. What I mean is instead of flowing along smoothly, the story slows as I tried to figure out why the events unfolded as they did. Since a number of years are involved in the story, it was real difficult to keep it all tied together.It did end as all stories do, but it let me down. It did have the potential to be much better."
2,what a bore,"i knew it be a matter of time before the grishman/baldacci style of writing junk for the masses would get to me. well, it has. I read this book in two days and like other reviewers found the story implausible and the charachter development moronic. i guess that is why grishman/baldacci sell so well."
5,Great Music,"If you like Grieg's music, you'll love this book. Norwegian Dances, Valses-Caprices, excerpts from Peer Gynt, Moods, and even the wonderful Sonata in E minor are included in this very worthwhile edition. Buy it!!"
3,For beginners only,"This compilation is better than previous attempts in capturing music, the memories, from key scenes. But as others also note, there are major omissions. Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"", obviously. And what ""Vice"" junkie could forget the memories evoked by ""Brothers in Arms"" by Dire Straits, ""Cry"" by Godley & Creme, ""Dead or Alive"" by Bon Jovi, ""Bad Attitude"" by Honeymoon Suite, ""Tell Me"" by Terry Kath, or even Sheena Easton. Russ Ballard is hard to find anywhere.Because individuals decide which ""Vice"" scenes, which music (from a huge cross-section of music from a five year time span during which Jan Hammer and Tim Truman, both magnificent, ran the show), mattered the most, no single collection will be definitive.In the end, people are best off getting Jan Hammer's ""Miami Vice: The Complete Collection"" sountrack compilation, and making one's own ""hit"" collection using song lists from the various ""Miami Vice"" web site."
4,No Voices,"The tracks in this album are real good, but like someone mentioned before no ""In the air tonight"", the song that made Miami Vice famous in the first place (besides the theme). One other song that is not on any of the Miami Vice soundtracks is a song titled Voices by Russ Ballard. This song was played in the Prodigal Son episodes when Crockett and Tubbs were on their way in the speedboat to the Bahamas to arrest Caldarone. Great song but always omitted from any soundtrack."
3,When Good Tales Go Flat,"The only thing keeping Blind Guardian from being the biggest metal band is redundancy. Tales is a good example of what happens when a great band writes mediocre songs. To the albums credit, it is more straight forward, and has less vocal overdubs than A Night at the Opera, but lacks in the good song writing and dynamics. The musicainship is great,but the album is flat, and typical. No songs stand out and you have basically heard it all after the first two.If you not a BG fan, skip this one and get Demons and Wizards. A side project between BG and Iced Earth, It is more dynamic and memorable."
5,sherif the gurdian,"hey i want tell you if you just think to buy this cd,i say to you dont think at all,go fast to get it,if you miss this cd you miss your life ,beleave me this album is more great more melodic,when i lithen this album i feel my spirit fly with the melody and harmony coooool man hail 1000 hail to bLINd GURDiaN as same BUY OR DIE"
4,Emeril's book is great for all ages!,"I love the way that he lays out the basic info like types of cooking utensils and cookware that you will use, and also description of cooking techniques like chopping,etc. Being only an average cook, I feel like I will also learn plenty by using this cookbook. The recipes are not fru fru. They are real normal recipes that kids will eat, but BAM! ""kicked up a notch!"" A great cookbook!"
5,ahhh Chrysanthemum,Corelle is Excellent Quality. I gave this set to my daughter and she loves it. Chrysanthemum is beautiful! I have ordered additional dinner plates to go with it. I'm thinking about a set for myself...
5,Original and Very Funny ! ! !,"This is one wild ride of a funny novel. Jerry Applegate takes us on a tour of of the gay bars of Chicago looking for the perfect man. His adventures will have you staying up all night turning pages to find out where his quest ultimately takes him. Very well written and extremely witty, I can only tremble with anticipation awaiting Ron Abraytis' follow up to this outstanding debut."
1,Unhappy,"Tha cd player don't workTry to get a return form and they never answer,,,, tomorrow i will send it back with out paper.Thank for the last time ,,i never buy anything else from this co."
1,unsatisfied,this head unit is of less quality than the stock stereo i replaced this head unit with i don't recommend this product to anyone the cd player takes forever to load the bass sounds horrible and i have all new speakers in my car 6.5 pioneers in the front and naxa 1000watt 6x9s in the rear all professorially wired and i could barely hear my subs and im running two 10in kickers and a competition amp also professionally wired
4,"Good Album, Great Guest Artists!!","I would agree with the previous review. Not for you if you want something akin to the last release. This album is very different and the songs are certainly very rock oriented. Great for James Lavelle dipping his hand in other pots. Now you've got the hip hop, techno, and rock oriented albums.... all great in my opinion. I already was a fan of the collaborating artists (Josh Homme, Autolux, The Duke Spirit, Ian Astbury) which was a main reason I bought this album. I think the ""indie-rock"" collaborated tracks are the stand outs. ""Restless"" and ""Mayday"" are my favorites. ""Burn My Shadow"", ""Persons & Machinery"" definitely sounds Autolux. There are surely some good tracks here, even if you just want to download a couple of the better ones rather than buy the whole album. ""War Stories"" may speak to a different crowd than UNKLE's previous efforts but it is by no means a disappointment."
4,You got the wrong guy....,"I love the song ""Broken"" but guys, that isn't Gavin Clark. It's Mark Hollis from Talk Talk. I'm convinced. I've always loved Talk Talk and that song is just awesome. If only Mark had sang more. I think the album is quite a departure from the other stuff I've heard by UNKLE. I like this direction."
1,Expected More,"I wanted and expected to like this record but was sadly disappointed. The foray into rock seems, unfortunately, like an overt and contrived attempt at maintaining the originality that made UNKLE such a refreshing project. I don't know if it's the lyrics or their delivery, but they mostly come across as cliche. The heavy rock sound is such a departure from their previous output that it confuses the whole project for me. I know this sounds harsh, but only because I respect and enjoy both DJ Shadow and James Lavelle and expected more."
2,A very different band,"I had heard there was more live band ""samples"" this time around, but was surprised that most of these songs are complete live-tracked-sounding-indie-rock style songs, with very little of the deep throbs and layered samples from the earlier releases. Good for James Lavelle for branching out, but I'm surprised he put this under the same ""Unkle"" name as this is a very rough rawk feel, almost like a Queens of the Stone Age remix album (the production influence is quite apparent).Two stars feels harsh, but after a few listens there's no memorable songs. I also made the mistake of buying the pricier 2-disc box set with the instrumental versions and art. If you want an interesting upbeat rock album with guest artists, this may be more your style, but if you're looking for more spacey/electronic (""I need something Stronger"", ""Inside"", ""Rabbit in the Headlights"") or the big beat tracks (""Reign"", ""Eye for an Eye""), you should stick with the first two albums."
2,Eh,"Really disappointed. The 20 second preview of the songs sounded better than the full versions. Thought it would be a little more upbeat instead the majority of the songs are real mellow. For the most part, it sounds like a bad soundtrack."
5,very very nice,"it is nothing like the last cd, that is still a good thing. these guys really have not ever made a bad cd. this one is great because they went (again) in a different direction. the locals are great, and about three of the songs have been on csi n.y. i give it 5 stars, and cant wait to hear a remix lp...... killerblack hit me up"
5,++++++++++++++++++++,"big up!!! I am glad that it doesn't sound exactly like the previous two/what's the point of making same stuff over and over again?/Extremely well crafted,if you have any feel for the rythm-it will get under your skin.Absolutely nothing boring and forgetable about it.Don't miss them live."
5,great singing by a legendary singer,"This is a great CD by the lengendary Brazilian soprano, Bidu Sayao. A better performance of the Debussy does not exist even though it was recorded about 50 years ago. Sayao has not been surpassed. Also, the Mozart arias are a special treat as are the Bellini, Verdi, and Puccini. Sayao was a wonderful artist and very unique in her interpretations. This CD offers great singing and should be acquired by record collectors who value sensitivity, style, and voice qualities above and beyond the superficial. The tragedy is that Sayao was not recorded as frequently as she deserved -so what we have are limited treasures."
4,broan filter,"product was sent in timely manner, however it was bent in 2 places, but still workable,i did not contact the seller regarding this"
3,"Great fun bib, but cannot be washed.","Although this is a colorful fun bib, it cannot be washed. It is crazy considering all that goes on a bib :) I thought I read somewhere it can be handwashed, but on the product it states that it cannot be washed.I have whiped it off and it is still looking ok, but at some point it will not come clean enough and will need to go to the trash."
4,anchovettefan,this fish based spread is both unusual and delicious...used to eat it growing up in south africa.....TRY IT! the taste is unusual and goes well on rye toast with sliced tomattoes.
3,"Wonderful Ninth, yoked to a drab Fifth","I have always regretted the way London/Decca rearranged the Haitink performances: the original pairing of this performance of the 9th was with an equally fine performance of the 1st (now paired with the intermittently interesting but ultimately unsuccessful 3rd). The performances of both symphonies on the original disc capture the mix of light and dark, playfulness and tragedy, lyricism and satire. It is unfortunate, that the current disc pairs an exemplary recording of the witty 9th with Haitink's beautifully played yet drab and soulless account of the 5th. Try to find the earlier disc."
4,Good introductory survey,"A survey of common practice in TTS sytems together with major limitations as well as research directions. Generally well written, I would prefer more precise technical details though."
4,So far so good,"I live in an area that is intensely dry (Wyoming) and, in addition, have developed a very bad reaction to the chlorine in our water - it makes my eyes itchy and painful and dry. I've been using the Rainshow'r filter for several weeks and have so far found it has made my painful eyes about 90% better, and my hands less sandpaper-y after showering. I'm a fan!"
5,"Love this filter, shower head and recyle program",We've been using the Ranshow'r shower filters now for over 3 years and we love them. We replace our filters (we have two showers) every 6 months and send the old filters back for recycling. We just bought new units with the shower heads and we really love the shower heads as well...easy to swivel and adjust the stream to just the right strength.
4,Good Value,This product arrived in a timely manner and was easy to install. It seems to work very well. Enough said!
1,"Not working for tap water in Rosarito, MX","I'm currently living in Rosarito, MX now and the tap water here is super hard and chlorinated. After using this product for 2 months now, the water is only a little less hard and my skin still has painful irritation bumps. I was in Vegas for 4 days and my skin cleared up from the hotel shower but when I got back, in 2 days the bumps came back and my hair is like straw again. I will try another shower filter. Perhaps I have no hope since the tap water here is the hardest I've seen. I am now using bottled water to wash my face. I hope the bumps go away soon."
3,Incompatable,It wasn't compatible with my plumbing. I did not realize that I had a ball behind my shower head. The manual says that there is an adapter but as it is I have not yet been able to install it.
5,WOW,"So i moved into a new apartment last yr and i started to notice my water smelled kinda funny and everytime i got out of the shower my skin was itchy and i started breaking out. I thought to myself it has to be the water cus i never had this in my life . I researched about filtered showers and i came across this one . Man am i happy i did . My skin is glowing,smooth,never itchy anymore . I get my one or two pimples here and there nothing like i had before and best of all my hair shot down like crazy!! my hair is now right above my butt. my hair lady asked me what i am doing because she has never seen my hair this long. I believe that now all the chorline and dirt is out of my water so thats why. THIS SHOWER ALSO FEELS AMAZING AND STEAMS GREAT. Def massages my skin, i never want to get out . Thank you for making this shower avaible at such a great price ! hope my review helped . buy this you won't be dissapointed."
3,"An interesting, honest slant on David","I've just finished this book and find the REAL life of David far more exciting then the shortened, beautified version of King David in our Bible teachings. He was quite the fellow with quite the story. I find the idea of religion and mostly the Bible fascinating, and enjoy it when I hear the real story. I emphasis Story because that is what I feel the Bible is."
1,Another Quack on the loose!,"Kirsch's account of King David's life is highly questionable to say the least. The book is full of conjecture. The flaws in the author's reasoning are apparent on the face of every page. His perception of King David's relationship with God and country is severely unschooled and a danger to follow. Anyone interested in appreciating the true story of ""The man after God's heart"" would be better off reading the Biblical accounts. Don't waste your money on this quack historian who seems committed to justifying base persuits with the flaws of the great men and women of Biblical antiquity."
1,A misleading buy,On the back cover this book promises to include biblical archaeology with the traditional stories from the bible - but it does not.I read the first 60 pages and then dipped into some later sections in utter frustration. All this book does is weave together a story based almost wholely on the bible stories. You find out very little that a read of the bible would not provide.I consider the book a waste of money.
1,How NOT to write a biography,"It is very evident that the motive of the author was to debunk the Old Testamentin general, and the biblical David in particular. In doing so, he appears to reference all his material with notated references to the index. Howefver, if you examine these references, many are stated as factual material. In reality, they were previously written by another individual,and their validity is highly suspect. He uses other versions of the Bible to support his position, and roughly 150 books which he eviscerated passages to support his positions. A fairytale!"
1,An awful album,"This is by far the worst thing Triumvirat has ever made. ""A La Carte"", the former album, was a solid pop-rock effort. But this album has nothing to offer to a Triumvirat fan. The band was only keyboard wizard Jürgen Fritz and lead singer Arno Steffen. All other instruments were played by session men (including members of Toto). Nothing wrong with the instrumental, but the vocals are terrible, and all songs are uninspired. Buy it only if you are a completist."
2,Wrong Track-list,"The list of tracks in this section is from the ""A La Carte"" album. The song titles from ""Russian Roulette"" are as follows,1. Party Life2. You Can't Catch Me3. Games4. Cooler5. The Ballad Of Rudy Torner6. We're Rich On What We've Got7. Twice8. Rien Ne Vas Plus9. Roxy10. Russian RouletteIt's an interesting album (I have the vinyl copy), but it's definitely not the Triumvirat that I love listening to. I have the 'essential' Triumvirat CD's - Illusions, Spartacus, Old Loves Die Hard, and Pompeii. It seems that they have gone in a totally different direction on this album. That's why I only gave it two stars. It's still worth a listen, though.I hope they release Helmut Koellen's solo ""You Won't See Me"" on CD as well."
3,Top half,"The description on this was one size fits up to dress size 12 - I am a dress size 8, and the pants were snug to say the least. I decided to let a friend of mine who is more like a size 6 try the pants, and while they ""fit"" the stripe in them was less than flattering on even her hips. I did end up using the rest of the costume with leggings and knee high boots which looked great and worked out perfectly for my event!"
3,No Hands,"When I opened this product, the hands had fallen off during shipment. There is no easy way to put hands back into place because the metal they are made of is so flimsy that they bend very easily. If the hands are bent, the clock doesn't keep time right. I was frustrated that the product arrived broken, but I called and they sent a replacement right away. Other than having to wait for the second clock to come,I was pleased with the second one especially since it was in working order when it arrived"
5,Excellent Basic Metabolism and Advanced Nutrition Book,This is an excellent book for basic nutrition metabolism. It serves the basics you need for a more advanced courses. I would use this book to furnish/review basic knowledge before I would go into a deeper/specific area of nutrition metabolism.Excellent for B.S students.Excellent for those interested to review and re-visit basic nutrition during advanced schooling (M.S/PhD/Medical concerning nutrition).
5,A GREAT P.O.D RECORD!!!!,"First of all let me say that I am not a big fan of hardcore music at all but P.O.D is prolly in my top 5 bands of all time. Yeah, this CD only has 7 songs but it's still awesome. It's one of my favorites because they took some of their older songs and re-recorded them. The songs from Snuff the Punk and Brown sound much better on this album. To make it even better they have a different version of southtown with more screaming which is a wonderful thing!!!"
4,A prelude to a major label debut,"An excellent preview of what is to come on their debut for Atlantic. While it is true that three of the songs are from previous albums (""Breath Babylon"" and ""Full Color"" from BROWN and ""Draw the Line"" from SNUFF THE PUNK), the production on this EP is far superior to that of the previous albums. And that alone makes this recording a very worthwhile listen."
4,waste of recording time,"First of all, there are only seven tracks, two of which aren't even songs. Secondly, two of the songs are already on their ""Brown"" CD. Of the two remaining songs, ""Southtown"" kicks butt and is my new favorite P.O.D. song, but ""Draw the line"" even though it has good lyrics, it is a very hoaky song. Overall, it's not really worth the money except for the song ""Southtown""."
1,Wrong language,I didn't get to see it because it would not play on my player. Didn't realize what kind of DVD until I tried to play it.
4,Not available in US region,"I have tried for some years to locate this DVD, always finding it only available in regions not in the US; I can play it only on my pc, but it's worth it. It's another in a series of Barbara Cartland novels, so you know what to expect. It completes my small collection of her novels on film. It's still sappy, so-so acting, but fun to watch if you don't expect quality performances. How do some of these performers (note I did not refer to them as ""Actors"") get on film? Poor Lysette Anthony is definitely miscast, but this is true of her involvement in other period films as well."
1,Tedious and Ridiculous,"As a professor of political science at Columbia University it is shocking to see that such a terribly written and outrageous theory could be published. This book is a disgrace to the field and should be noted as the most aweful piece of writing I have ever had the displeasure to read. The author believes himself infallible and is clearly suffering from delusions if he could seriously consider this as a serious piece of academic literature. Overall, the worst historical interpretation ever written."
4,1/2 Of...,"This release is an interesting affair. Cluster shifted gears a few times in the mid-70s, arriving at a very atmospheric, stripped-down approach to electronic music with ""Sowiesoso"" and their collaborations with Michael Rother as Harmonia. And as such, it's only logical that Brian Eno, the godfather of ambient music, would collaborate with them. The results are documented here and in a bookend work, ""After the Heat"", as well as a few tracks on Eno's ""Before and After Science"", and the results are stark, beautiful, and amazing. In a few places, things get a little tedious, but this really doesn't detract all that much from the goings-on here. Docked one star because, honestly, this should be in the same package with its tandem release ""After the Heat"" to get the real feel of the pairing. A critical release."
2,high sierra lumbar pack can stay solo!,"This isn't a bad pack, it just isn't great. I returned it. The drink holder isn't insulated and it's uncomfortable if you don't have anything on the other side to balance it. Also, the straps need to be wider, at least where they connect to the pack. I also thought this was a little overpriced."
2,No Storage Capacity,"I choose this model thinking it would fit a big waist, which it does, but I expected it to be able to hold more than just keys and kleenex. I needed it to have a larger storage department and was very disappointed."
3,Not a Perfect Fit,"Ergonomically comfortable, lots of pockets, well over a foot worth of trail-ready storage, plus two holsters for water bottles, all in a sturdy, well-made product with adjustable sizing for the perfect fit.The only problem was that it is designed for recreation, not work. My farmer husband was put off by the myriad of various-sized compartments obviously designed for keys, cell phone, credit cards, etc. He wanted one mega pocket (and hold the water) for farm chore duty - you know, pocket knife, fencing staples, tobacco pouch.I had the size right, and this product does it all, but the fit was wrong for the intended usage. This is a pouch for Sierra-Clubbers or joggers."
2,Quality great but...,"I was really impressed with how well made this is, however I won't be keeping it. The main problem is that my arm kept hitting the water bottle when I walked - regardless of whether I had it on my front or back. I am petite, and I think if you're bigger around the stomach you will not have the issue."
3,For a more serious hiker than me...,"This bag is well made, and holds a lot, but was really more than I needed for my casual hiking. I found it too heavy and bulky, so I did return it."
2,Novel about Pro-lifers that cross the line misses the mark,"This novel is about a group of pro-Life advocates that decide that non-violent means of protest that they have used in the past are ineffective. But after bombing a new facility for harvesting aborted babies, they learn that violence is not the answer either.This somewhat depressing novel didn't hold my interest and the plot doesn't seem to hold together. The audio quality was poor which made the listening even harder. I can't recommend it"
1,far right propaganda,"Unlike what many other reviewers have written, this book is NOT based in truth. It is about liberal doctors harvesting fetus brains for AIDS research, aka killing babies to save homosexuals, which is NOT at all based in reality. Please be aware of what you are getting yourself into when you choose to buy this book."
4,"An enjoyable, beautiful yet somber novel","David Bottoms was a teacher (maybe he still is) at Georgia State where I graduated from. My first few years in school I wanted to be a novelist and became an English Major. Bottoms was the guy whose class EVERYBODY wanted to get into.I never did. I tried 3 straight semesters and got blocked all 3 times. Later I changed majors (twice). Anyway, I heard about this genius/poet/novelist and I HAD to read his book. I am glad that I did. It is a simple story about simple people but it's beautifully written and the characterization/description/plot and well, just about everything, work well in the story. i only gave it 4 stars because I felt it could have been a lot longer than it was. I do not like SHORT novels and it left me wanting more. I don't know if any of you have ever read any Pinckney Benedict or Flannery O'Connor but Bottoms writes very much like them. I wish he'd write more novels. The book is a definite good read and I highly reccomend it."
1,What a waste...,"I hate to be negative, but I could not bring myself to finish the book. It was sooo... stupid."
2,Where's the sauce?,"I ordered this gift as a Christmas present thinking it would come with some sort of ""hot sauce of the month certificate"" so that I could explain the gift. Instead I got two bottles of sauce- no mention of the club. It is now two months after I placed the initial order and I haven't received the second months worth. I'm sure it will get here some day. But they should let you know when to expect it."
5,boot knife,"came as advertised. Came sharp, not razor sharp. Straps tight where you want to strap it. Releases from sheath easy enough. Pretty much everything I was looking for. Hope I never have to use it. But I send my regrets ahead of time just in case I do. Will update the review if I come across anything I don't like:)"
4,Pretty sick,"Was sketchy at first. Turns out the knife is perfect. Solid one piece of steel all the way from tip through the handle. Awesome. Sheath has crimp in the top to keep the blade secure. Awesome. Ankle straps are perfect, adjustable, and stay tight. Overall great buy. Recommended if you want a sick boot knife."
2,not the quality i expected,"This product came in a manila envelope and inside was the box with the knife. upon first inspection i noticed on the handle where the hole is, it is unpainted and rusted or cast iron of some sort. this gives the whole knife a cheap appearance and i am unhappy with this product. this knife also came only adequately sharp my buddy had bought the same knife and so i figured since i liked it so much i would buy my own. i am unsatisfied and will not buy from this seller again. i will be sending a complaint to customer service and will update my review after i have gotten a response. thanks for reading."
2,All show no go?,"After reading the reviews for this knife I was under the impression that it was super tough and durable.... I opened it today and figured I'd give it a toss at a piece of pine firewood I had in the house, after the first throw the tip was bent and it barely stuck in the wood.I then ran the edges across the same piece of wood and now they need sharpening. This never happened with my KA's or Gerber's. So much for being a tough knife.It also came very dull, not that big a deal mind you, but now along with fixing the tip I already have to sharpen it. Its still a fun/neat little knife unfortunately I can see its going to need constant maintenance.I'm not an expert but it seems to me that a block of pine wood should not bend the tip of a knife nor should it mar the edges."
2,AG Russell blade,"Recieved the knife I ordered Wednesday. For a Russell knife i was/ am very disapointed. It's a ""clumsy"" feeling slab of metal. It doesn't have the feel that it should have. The ""Razor sharp edge"" could not have been duller if you had taken a grinder and a hammer to the edge. I will most likly toss the piece of junk and keep the sheath ( which is good quality) to use with a real knife. Don't waste your money on this junk. Columbia River normally has great products and I own a couple dozen of them. But this time they dropped the ball big time."
3,worning,this knife is small cool and can be concealed easy with no worries the only thing that i hate is that this knife is dull when i got it but for what i paid for i think i got a good deal
4,first knife you should buy,this knife is very small and the case is just a little too big so you cant pull it out as easy as it should be but this knife is the very first knife you should buy becuase its small durable and can strap to your body
4,quite good,"purchased for use as a dive knife (i liked the looks), and overall it does well. however as this is a high carbon blade it does rust very fast if not taken care of. also while the sheath is versatile and holds the blade in well, it seems unneccesarily bulky. and as for the blade it self edge retention is only fair. otherwise i do think the knife is designed well, nice feel, decent balance, very durable."
4,nice little hold out knife...but not great for too much else,"I really like this knife, and as a boot knife, its perfect. Small, light, sharp. The solid single piece construction is ideal for a boot knife like this. The handle is a little small for my hand (i wear size large gloves). Best to take that in consideration. When I got this knife it was not sharp at all, but the steel took a nice sharp edge fairly quickly. It does not hold the edge though, even through use for just 30 mins or so. But the idea of a boot knife isnt to dig trenches or batong firewood. Its to keep a last ditch knife on your person so when you are in the situation that you need it, its there and sharp and ready. The sting is great for that. The included sheath lends itself to a large variety of wear options."
5,WOW!,I have had this knife for six months and i have loved it. This knife is extremly sharp and very strong. I carry this knife every place i go. It comes in and out of the sheath very nicly but will not fall out. It balences in my hand like a dream I have big hands and this is a small knife but it is not at all uncomfortable. I have had friends beg me to sell it to them or order them one. This knife has been through a lot of heavy work and has always come through sharp as ever and never a scratch.In my opinion this si the best CRKT (Columbia River Knife and Tool) ever and i would recomend it to every one who wants a real mans knife.
3,nice knife,"nice knife. Fine steel, well made,fits hand nice. Very good sheath and velcro straps. Straps nice to end table leg,easy access for me. For price should be sharp and of finer finish. GOOD BUY."
4,Good quality at a fair price,"This knife appears to be a good quality knife with a few pock marks so it was not perfect out of the package. It seems sharp but a bit smaller than expected. I am still having a hard time getting the straps and sheath to fit on my leg. It doesn't stay in place and slips down my calf. But overall, it is acceptable quality at a reasonable price."
3,"Great sheath, but really heavy","This is a well designed and made boot dagger. It was extremely sharp from the factory. The sheath is probably the most outstanding thing about the knife - it is great for attaching to a forearm or calf and holds the knife securely, even when running or jogging. For me the knife has two disadvantages: because it is made completely from steel, the knife is very heavy for its size; also the blade is a bit short. Blade length is reasonable for back up defensive needs, but too small as a primary blade."
5,Handyman's secret weapon.,"I have used this knife constantly since its purchase, and must say it is everything I had hoped for. Being very well balanced allows it to be thrown underhanded, similar to a shuriken. The double sides allows one edge to be sharp enough to shave with while the other can be a slightly more blunt utility edge. The sheath works great allowing easy removal of the blade, but tight enough that it has never slipped free while hung vertical on the back of my belt (which is where I typically carry it). Others complain about the maintenance, but I have never had a problem with rust even though I only sharpen it once a week and it is constantly used in moist conditions. I suppose if you hardly ever sharpen or use the blade it would rust due to the high quality cutting edge.I strongly recommend this over the other boot knives sold online, or locally."
5,SOLID!!!,"I have a few CRKT's but this one by far is my favorite. It is one solid piece of steel. This gives it unparalleled strength and durability. The coating is thick and will most likely never wear off. The sheath and leg straps allow it to be worn around your leg, arm, or on your belt. A must buy!"
4,Sting Boot Knife,"I don't know about it being ""razor"" sharp but it fits the bill otherwise and I am satisfied with the product. The leg sheath is better than most others and holds the knife securely in place. It's not a level 3 retention system, but it gets the job done and your knife isn't likely to fall out by accident."
4,Nice conceal carry fixed blade,"Heavy, sharp but not razor, not for larger hands, all around good fixed blade for a concealed horizontal carry. Durable. Just spent a week in the Rockies and fashioned quite a few fishing spears with just this knife."
3,A piece of metal,"Good weight, fairly heavy for its size. Solid piece of metal. It's about as ""razor sharp"" as a baseball though. Reminds me of something you'd get in one of those wannabe martial arts stores, not what I would expect from a knife company. Bud K would be a good comparison. I'll probably use it as a cheap thrower and not much else. I can't imagine fighting with it as the finish is so slick you'd end up sticking yourself. It's a good throw away/utility knife that you don't care about."
3,Not very durable,"I keep reading reviews about how durable this knife is, but it really isn't. The blade is a pain to maintain, knicks easily, and must be kept oiled or the edges will rust. It's a good ankle knife, but don't expect it to be a buy and forget knife. I have to sharpen or hone mine almost every day to keep it in good condition."
3,an ok knife,I bought this knife to carry for self defense they knife is good but the sheath has a lot to be desired. the belt loops is small the straps is flimsy. if the redign the sheath will be a lot better for what its suppose to be made for
2,Nature's Image Aquafern,"Not impressed with this product. In the picture it looked nice and full. It came in a package that was absolutely flat. Even after soaking it for 24 hours as per instructions it was still skimpy. It is extremely delicate and after soaking broken pieces floated to the top. It is a natural product that has been cured, dried, and dyed (which was not mentioned in the description) and it is very brittle. It does look very natural, but is too delicate for my liking. If you are looking for a sturdy artificial plant, I would not recommend this product."
3,A VERY DEPRESSING LOOK AT OUR LEGAL SYSTEM!,"I am a fanatic Gina Gershon fan and her being in the cast of ""Legalese"" is the ONLY reason I purchased it.This film which also stars James Garner(excellent,as an ethically challenged Hollywood lawyer) and Mary-Louise Parker(in a very sexy and beautifully played role,as an aide to Garner).Gina as sexy actress Angela Beale is accussed of murder and Garners' law firm handles her defense.The three leads are fine,but this film depicts the utter curruption that the American legal system has fallen to.In fact,ALL aspects of American society are shown as being totally currupt.GINA WAS GREAT,but the film VERY depessing.The picure quality of the DVD was fine."
5,A Must-Have,"This is the best rendition of the mazurkas I have ever heard. Brailowsky plays with a certain ""friskiness"" which turns these somewhat simple pieces into works of art. I especially enjoyed Op.33, #3(D+) Also on the cd are 3 polonaises. I don't care much for the f-, but the g#- and d- were excellent. I have listened to the cd hundreds of times. I strongly recommend it."
5,This book was magnivifcient,"I really loved this book,i thought this book was very creative and funny. You should really read it."
3,Good Read,"I hadn't purchased a Joyce Meyer book before.This is a good book. Somewhat repetitive of a lot of other books I have read, but still an enjoyable book, encouraging and enlighting."
3,Knowing God Intimately,"Book cover like new, pages in good condition. Some writing in the book. For the price I will managage and thank you."
5,Another great book by Joyce Meyer!,"Joyce Meyer is, in my view, the most inspired and relevant Christian author alive today. I have read four of her books so far, and I consider each very rewarding, and potentially life-changing. This book, like Joyce's other books, accomplishes exactly what the title suggests. If you want to truly know how to walk closely with God, and live a rich Christian life, read this or any one of Joyce's books. I have also enjoyed ""How to Hear from God"", ""Seven Things That Steal Your Joy"" and ""In Pursuit of Patience"", all of which are available on Amazon. Joyce, if you are reading this, may God bless you, for you have been a blessing from God for me."
3,Pink vs Clear,"Being a person of color, I preferred the clear variety of patches I had previously purchased to the pink ones. Clear is better for me, less distinguishable."
3,Brilliant #2...The Remainder of These 2 CD's are Worthless,"Sony should have re-released only the Schippers on a single CD. This is the most brilliant reading of this difficult symphony I have ever heard. As for #1...Stokowski hit his high point as a conductor with the pap from ""Fantasia""...it was all downhill for him after that. The best recording of Finlandia is Sir Colin Davis/Boston Symphony. Richard Hickox is a nullity and his conducting shows that in ample display with this reading. As for Eugene Ormandy and his Karelia...Stravinsky said it best...""Ormandy is an ideal conductor of Strauss waltzes."" The Violin Concerto is serviceable, but nothing special...Good playing by Francescatti, but an indifferent accompaniment by Bernstein and his charges."
4,Another nice Cluster record,"While it is not one of their masterpieces and is maligned in some quarters I personally think that Cluster have come up with another good record, a great one in parts."
3,Middling Work,"I don't know what on earth the reviewer below is on about but Cluster were definitely not in East Germany when they recorded this album! What used to be the first side of the album is full of the careful, melodic music that Cluster had been perfecting since ""Zuckerzeit"" - some of this is undoubtedly very good, Roedelius' knack of writing charmingly childlike melodies is well to the fore, but it tends to be a kind of in-on-ear-out-the-other music. In fact Roedelius' ""Jardin Au Fou"" album, recorded in the same studio at around this time is much more impressive. The title track is just dull and rather sloppy. I'd give this album three-and-a-half if I could but i can't, so three it is."
4,Childhood memories...,"My mother used to make this pizza every week when I was a kid. I LOVED it. I moved cross-country about 14 years ago and had almost forgotten it existed as you can't find it anywhere in Los Angeles. Someone from back home mentioned it recently and I went on an internet hunt for it soon after. I was DELIGHTED to find this seller on Amazon and beg them to keep it in stock! It's almost exactly as I remember -- crispy and tangy and fantastic! It does seem like the pizza sauce is thinner, more watery, then I remembered it being, but when it bakes, it's bubbly and rich. There's never enough cheese, but I always have ground parmesian on hand, so with a few extra sprinkles of that, I think it's about perfect. So excited to have it again. If only the shipping charge was a bit better... this would be a meal for a steal."
3,Okay...,"Great pizza, but NOT enough cheese or pepperoni. You have to add your own special touch to it. They provide the tiniest amount of powdered cheese. I added my own shredded mozeralla cheese, but it cooked too fast for the crust. The crust needs more than 20 minutes too cook. It's a good pizza, but you need to buy extra cheese and pepperoni."
3,CD is Okay,"I really like some of UNKLE's music, but not necessarily a fan of all of their music. Sometimes they nail it, and sometimes...not so much."
5,Wonderful,"Great quality that I have come to expect from Abrams' ""Masters of Art"" series; beautifully bound hardcover, an expose on Bruegel, an artist I've always found particularly interesting. Contains a 45pg introduction to Bruegel, his style, and major works; the section is accompanied by numerous black & white drawings and paintings of Bruegel (There are 115 images total, only 40 color plates). The color plates are lavish and come with an analysis.As a lover of Dutch Art, I purchased this book in conjunction with 0810907194, or Bosch, another wonderful volume of the ""Masters of Art"" series"
2,Rank Bad,"So after receiving a couple of unfavorable reviews, Amazon decided to change the webpage for this item and delete previous user comments.Still doesn't distract users from the fact that much like our Indian fielders, the BCCI and Nike have clearly dropped the ball when it came to cashing in on merchandise.With the WC well underway and still no sign of the official jersey being released, its pretty obvious who the real winner is. Noone. Neither them nor the die hard cricket crazy fans.Well done !"
3,5000 Rs....must be joking.///,5000 INR for this....lol...i would rather wait and get a replica made by someone else
2,Not great.,"Just received these in UK, very quick delivery thanks. Sadly the product quality is not that good and the blade rigidity is not great. Have used Red Devil brand until trying these and always been happy. Whilst these are not great, they're not bad enough for me to return them back to USA, they'll do the job until they inevitably get lost. They where a bit cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for.However can't fault the service when it comes to getting things sent out quickly."
4,A hidden KS gem,"This is part of a collaborative series between Pete Namlook and Klaus Schulze (KS). I am not yet familiar enough with the former to comment on his style but for KS fans, this is an album you will want to listen to. KS' synthesizer voice is immediately recognizable in a context of very harmonic rythms that is oddly reminiscent to KS' earlier years (Moondawn, Picture Music,...).While this is not a ground breaking album, it is definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,Self Searching,I have listened to these tapes repeatedly. They were a comfort to me in my soul searching as to the reason for my existence on this earth. They help one think positive. The only flaw in the book is that some phrases are redundant. The author repeats himself to get a point across. I recommend these for someone feeling low self-worth. It could also help someone searching for God's plan for his life.
3,Wordy,"This book lays down some great concepts which are right on the money, but it's so wordy, that the lessons in the book get easily drowned out and forgotten. It's hard to absorb, hard to retain, and the book is so long, you'll be an old person when you're done reading the whole thing! I could easily trim the verbose fat out of each chapter and end up with a book that's more effective and only one-third the total number of pages. I recommend it, but take notes."
3,Just Ok,"I was really expecting this to be a good read, but found it somewhat boring and hard to push through."
2,Pedantic performances of J S Bach's Organ Works,"I was not very impressed with this recording, other than the Prelude and Fugue in C Major. The rest of it, especially in the Chorale Preludes is very pedantic.While the interpretations of Jean Guillou are not the most historically correct (neither are Vigil Fox's for that matter), the music still comes alive. However, that does not happen in this Leonhardt recording. They seem dead. It is a pity. I've heard other of his recordings and quite liked them. This one is an exception."
3,Not bad but the plug does get on your nerves if you have to move it around sometimes like I do as a DJ..,Not bad but the plug does get on your nerves if you have to move it around sometimes like I do as a DJ..But if you kept it in just one spot..Perfect!!!
2,Read fine print. 100GB Maxtor = 93 GB Windows,"At work I normally buy Seagate drives and expect 1 GB = 1,024,000,000 bytes, so 100 GB will show up in Windows as 100GB. The fine print on this box explains Maxtor defines 1GB as 1,000,000,000 bytes, which consequently shows up as 93 GB in Windows. The system requirements list Windows 2000 Pro, XP Pro or XP Home, so they are being purposefully deceitful in this definition of a GB.Other than that surprise, the drive worked fine out of the box. Not very fast, but fine for offline file storage."
3,"A problem with this recording , no one pointed this...","I recently bought this recording, and I noticed something that is distractive and embrassing, on the famous 3rd movement, between 1:45 and 1:48, the recording is confused, during the brass section playing the motif of five notes...I have the original recording with the warrior on the layout, not the ovation, or the new packaged version, who can confirm that this also appear on an recent released CD ?Thank You."
4,Great Album,"I am writing because there were several reviews commented that this version is tuned lower and Mr. Ma is taking liberty to the music as written, concluding that this is not a good album.This cello solo suite is tunned to how Bach inteded to be played. Modern music post-WWI uses 440 Hz for the concert pitch. In Bach era, they were tuned to 421-425 Hz for orchestra/solo/vocal. About half step lower.He seems to play this piece on ""well-tempered"" tuning system and tuned to 421-425 Hz A, which is the reason I think this recording sounds more musical than the earlier recording (which is played on 440Hz A and more modern equal temperment tuning). It brings out more key color charcteristic and sounds more musical and pleasing.If you are not sure what I am talking about you should do some research on tempered tuning system and variations of concert pitch. Pretty much all the modern orchestra plays music pieces completely different than what the composer intended."
2,Very Special Music - Not a Special Recording,"Yo-Yo Ma is an incredible musician and plays the cello in a way I could only dream. However, I am a big fan of Bach and especially these unaccompanied cello suites. I do not care for this recording. In my opinion, the tempo, phrasing and general nuance of these suites are not enjoyable because he takes many of them entirely too fast. I realize many players do this for various reasons (including demonstration of virtuosity) but I think the interpretation leaves much of the exquisite nuance un-communicated. Having said that, my wife likes this recording so she listens to the set in her vehicle and I stick to my recording made by Jacqueline du Pré."
3,"Digital or no, Casals still wins",The definitive recording of these Suites is still the ancient Casals receordings.
4,Tool for introspection,"I generally quite liked the recording. YYM seems to use the music as a means to find his own spiritual center. His effort was genuine and appreciated. The sound quality of the recording is very sweet and really brings out the quality of the instrument being played.I was a bit disapointed with the opening movement of the first as I found the tempo a little too quick for my liking. The slower movements sear and at times really pull on the heart strings.This collection, along with the violin equivalent should be listened too by all who are motivated by mastercraftmanship. Bach is the mastercraftman's mastercraftman."
3,UNINSPIRED BY MA,"Ma's playing is more effective in those suites (#2, #5) that withstand a melodramatic, rhythmically flexible performance. It is less effective where the music demands a stricter rhythm and a less adulterated interpretation (#1, #3, #4, #6). Inferior overall to Rostropovich's EMI recording, and with weaker cumulative impact, especially in the first movements of #1, #4, and #6."
2,Not Ma's Best!,"This recording seems to feature two different performers: Suites 1-3 played in mainstream acceptable tempos and suites 4-6 played so slowly that the sense of pulse seems to be completely missing. It seems that the cellist sees suites 4-6 as being more profound than the first three suites. To these ears, he equates reverential with slow. The prelude to the fourth suite is taken so slowly, I had to fight off the urge to doze. Contrast these performances to Yo Yo Ma's first go at them. The latter were full of life and to this day remain the best available along with the lilting Jean-Guihen Queyras performances.These works were written by Bach as dance suites. As played by Yo Yo Ma, suites 4-6 are only suitable to be danced by elephants.If these suites are to be released as single discs, I would recommend suites 1-3, although Yo Yo Ma's first recording betters these."
5,equal to Rostrpovich?,Ma is definitely the best interpreter of the cello suites out there. I think that his interpretations of the suites exceeds those made by Rostropovich in both emotion and technique. A definite must for both Bach and Yo Yo Ma fans out there.
2,Not as Good as 1987,"I much prefer the 1987 recording that Yo-Yo made of these wonderful Bach Suites. This version lacks the warmth and magical expression of the earlier one. Still, this is great, Yo-Yo is awesome, but I was disappointed by this one. I guess he had set such a high bar..."
2,"No, Yo Yo ....","A sub-standard, glossy, and sometimes sentimental interpretation of the Suites. Skip this one and go for the Rostropovich - always intelligent and inspired - never sentimental."
1,Overhyped,Ma forces the music; it is not relaxed and does not flow. His playing is lively but ill-suited to these particular pieces.
3,Why tune down?,"Very masterful interpretations, but Ma tunes his cello down an entire half step! Is he trying to sound baroque? Does he want it to sound slack, or loose, or invoke some subliminal sense of ""depth?"" To me this just takes the wind from the sails, and having heard other great interpretations I cannot then listen to Ma's. In addition, the production values are overly breathy and reverberant, as if he is recorded in a large tiled space, giving an artificial impression. I just don't understand this. I'm glad it didn't spoil so many other reviewers' enjoyment, and sorry to seem picky, but my observations are factual and sincere."
3,"A good budget Faust, but far short of the best","I can't understand why the previous reviewer oversold this live Damnation de Faust from 2003 -- it's provincial in every way, from the tremulous, nervous Faust daunted by his high-flying role to conductor Jean-Claude Casadesus's routine, underpowered conducting. You'll rarely hear a blander reading of a score that has brought out the best in Myun-Whun Chung and Igor Markevitch. I mention those two becasue their performances are quinessentially Gallic. This one is, too, but at a much lower voltage, not to mention mediocre talent. Only an edgy, sardonic Mephistopheles makes the listener sit up, and he can't carry the whole evening."
3,An acquired taste - but not mine,"This is a difficult recording to rate, because not everyone will like Haitink's monolithic approach to this work - I for one certainly do not. There is no doubt that Rintzler is superb, nor that the Concertgebouw Orchestra is playing at its peaks, but the director turns this fragile piece into a bombastic performance. Yevgeny Yevtushenko's poem about the massacre of a large number of jews by the Russians raises a sore point in Russian remembrance, and Shostakovich did full justice to this work, something which caused grave problems for him with the authorities. I much prefer Rozhdestvensky's old recording (but that one doesn't seem to be available any more) on Melodiya. Rozhdestvensky's bass speaks rather than sings, and the effect is astonishingly more dramatic than this, eventually rather flat, approach."
2,A farce?,"This book read like a cheezy, mystery version of Rubyfruit Jungle--set on the border, Chicana style. It is overflowing with stereotype and is in need of serious editing. Despite its length, I read it in 2 days (for me not always a good sign) and was slightly shocked at how disappointed I felt because I have been a fan of Gaspar de Alba's thoughtful, theoretical work. I wonder what, if anything, this perfectly-resolved tale will do to shed light on the murdered women of Juarez, other than to detail the horror of the killings, which her readers are likely to already know."
4,Julliard interprets Bartok's works excellently,"There are better interpretations of these seminal works available -- Takacs Quartet and Emerson Quartet do excellent versions, I'm told -- but for someone on a budget who would love to hear six great, innovative string quartets, you can't beat this disc.A two-disc set recorded in 1981 by the famed Julliard String Quartet, this collection takes what are considered by many to be the finest string quartets ever written and gives them a clear, beautiful interpretation. While the first two (and last) quartets are quiet and contemplative, things get really exciting in the middle portion, with 3, 4 and 5 bristling with energy and tension. This is ""modern"" classical at its finest.Julliard shows why Bartok was such a revered composer. If you want to go all out and get the aforementioned Takacs or Emerson versions, I'm sure you'll be sonically rewarded. But two excellent discs for under $15 is a great deal."
2,"Beautiful music, poor rendition","It has been said that Bartok's string quartets together are the best thing to happen to classical music since Beethoven's string quartets. There are many wonderful quartets out there performing these quartets, but this recording by the Juilliard Quartet just doesn't rank up there. I swear by the Emerson Quartet's rendition on Deutsche Grammophon which has wonderful recording quality and an amazing performance. I've heard the Takacs Quartet live and they indeed have their own wonderful way of interpreting the music that's different from the Emerson Quartet. I'd recommend either quartet's work heartily over the Juilliard's version, which is thin, lifeless, and simply unsatisfying. Don't think you're saving money -- you'll just end up buying one of the better versions anyway!"
4,Worth a listen,"Whilst it isn't a masterpiece, this album contains a wonderful set of songs. The songwriting of Bernard Butler will be well known to anyone familiar with the early Suede albums, and whilst these songs have a different tone from those performed by Suede, he does not let himself down. They are in fact an interesting stopping point on the transition Butler made to becoming a solo artist. The voice of David McAlmont is also the perfect tool that he could have found, and he seems to enjoy pushing it to its limit, much as he did with Brett Anderson. The combination of these two talents produces some truly magical moments. Well worth a listen."
4,Bernard Butler fans need apply.,"As I'm sure you already know if you are reading this, this is the first album of work that Bernard Butler was involved with after leaving Suede. As disappointed as I was for leaving one of my favorite bands of all time, this release really softened the blow. If you have heard his recent work with The Tears, you can hear a lot of the beginnings of his Phil Spectorish arrangements and stylings in this album that he incorporates in his current work with that band.If you are thinking of buying this for a Suede redux, you may be disappointed. The two are really apples and oranges. However, David McAlmont provides vocals with a range and dynamic that provides a perfect compliment to Bernard Butler's guitar work. The two of them provide a perfect blend of rock, soul and r&b; in this album that excels greatly on its own terms."
1,A disappointment,"I was disappointed with the content of this book. Although there were some simple science projects for preschoolers and good car games for 5-9 year olds, it is not a very imaginative book over all. Includes making paper airplanes, paper fans, and stringing macaroni. Not a lot of new ideas."
4,Travel Power Supply,"Up to this point the power supply has worked fine, have not had the opportunity to use on and airplane as of yet. Works fine in the car and regular outlets."
3,Necessary Evil,"First of all, it works fine, as intended. Since I travel so much I need the dc for long flights. It's just huge, considerably larger than the already large ac alone adapter and much, much heavier. This is not necessarily a knock on Lenovo, seems to be the case with most laptop makers. Wish I had looked closer at the iGo and Kensington products, if nothing else they look better and may be a little more compact. In the end, it's just an adapter, so I'm losing any sleep over it, but next time I buy a laptop I'll pay closer attention to all aspects of its design including the accessories."
3,too bulky,"Well, there is only this product on the market at present that allows to power a T60 on land and in the air. Unfortunately, it is 5 times the size of the product I used for my T40. It's a real brick!!! It works, though, but it gets way too warm."
4,Works like it should,"Works well, not too heavy, doesn't get too hot. Watch long movies on the plane. What else do you want - it's just a laptop power supply!"
4,"Works well, weighs a lot",This does handle the high wattage needs of my new ThinkPad well and it's great to have only one unit to carry. I do just wish it was lighter - this thing is substantial and weighs quite a bit more than a regular AC adapter.
4,Does the Job,"This is a fine product: it does the job. With few alternatives that offer AC/DC capability to the ThinkPad's Z series, this one works just fine. Indeed, the engineering and design might have been a bit more thoughtful (it's a little large and heavy), but there are few PC companies that truly make the effort to improve form factor. This one does the job, however..."
3,It's OK,The only complaint I have with this it that you cannot turn the burners down for simmering. Either something is wrong with the unit or this is just how it operates.
2,Poor Light Output,These lights don't compare to standard incandescent mini lights in output or color. Not worth the price.
1,"I tried to like this, really I did...","...but the hack writing got to me in the end. One-dimensional characters; cliché-ridden narratives and a plot that flails out of control. I like my erotica as much as the next woman, but I like it well-written. Pat Califia does it so much better."
3,Somewhat cliche but it turned me on.....,"This was a good and fast read. The real-time drama with its lovely sleazy sex scenes balanced with the other-wordly good vs. evil goddess dimension kept me tied in till the end -- erotica with a fantasy aftertaste? Good combination. Yes, the characters were a bit cliche, but some of us like cliche because those types of butches and femmes don't seem to exist anymore! And I don't expect all erotica to be superbly written, as I don't expect all porn to be well-acted. The most major issue I took with this book was that I found it irresponsible of the author to make the only black woman a submissive and to be treated, without her consent, the way she was. This book definitely got me riled up, on more than one level -- so much so that I'm hoping the find the second and third books of the trilogy."
4,The Original Cinderella Story,"I chose this book for my granddaughter based on other reviews because it was said to be a translation of the original story that was written by a French author. The illustrations are excellent except for one thing - Cinderella does not look ""one thousand times more beautiful"" than her ugly stepsisters in the illustrations. Might this teach a young girl that beauty may lie in what one wears? Although the story contained a few words (such as ""wicked"") I had to explain to my four year old granddaughter, she told me she liked it."
4,Nice Eno compilation,"Beautifully remastered, Begegnungen is again available on CD. If you are not overly familiar with the collaborations between Eno, Plank and Cluster, this is a nice place to start. However, like its companion, Begegnungen II it is a compilation of tracks available on albus such as After the Heat, Cluster and Eno and others. However this music was incredibly ahead of its time with its electronic landscapes and does not sound dated at all. It also serves as a nice compilation of this period but the albums themselves are essential even if sometimes difficult to find and pricey."
2,cheap,After one hand washing edges are all fraying and coming apart.All they had to do was hem those edges and it might last awhile.This one won't.
5,A sincere tribute: In Lecuona's memory!,"Placido domingo made another sincere homage around the crucial presence of Ernesto Lecuona, a superb and pyramidal composer of what euphemistically has been called the Latin song.Themes of transcendental importance in the repertoire: Malagueña, Maria la O, are sung with radiant vitality and renovated expression.You really should not miss this CD."
5,Beautiful Music,I have been very pleased with all the CD's I've purchased. They usually arrive earlier then expected and in perfect condition. I love Placido Domingo and all his music is wonderful - easy on the ear!rg10s
5,These are a must for pirate lovers,Alex bath toys are always quality. My grandson loves these for his bath and pool. They are brightly colored and durable.
5,Great game for puzzle fans,"I purchased this game back when the GameCube was still being made. To date, it's probably my most often played game for the system. It's a game that casual gamers can enjoy, and It's a popular party game among my friends. The only caveat is that you have to enjoy Tetris style gameplay in order to appreciate this game.As far as I know this is the only English translation available (it was on the Dreamcast in Japan). The character voices are in English, as well, which I prefer to the original Japanese. Unfortunately, sequels to this game were not localized for North America."
2,poor excuse for tetris,"this game was pretty lame. it comes off as a tetris wanna be, but very poorly. go for something else."
5,Great Product,I have a Bichon with multiple problems. Using this clicker as recommended by her trainer has made all the difference. It takes her out of her psychotic behavior and redirects her attention to positive activities. Highly recommended.
2,Buy A Bottle Of Snapple And Use The Cap Instead,"Yes, this does click. It's sturdy and others have said it is loud. Loud worked for me because I have 6 dogs and when 6 dogs start barking most clickers just won't do. However; One day, while fiddling with a Snapple cap, it clicked. My dogs reacted to the clicking sound just as they did to the clicker. The Snapple cap is less expensive, fits in your pocket, you get the benefit of the drink itself, if you lose the cap you have lost no money and as previously stated; it is just as effective as the clicker sold here. Save your money."
4,Great except for one issue,"I really like this clicker. It has a key ring that I clipped to my treat bag so that I would not have to carry it. I like how it has a button and is easy to make it click from any angle. However, at first my one dog was scared of the sound, and I had wished Triple Crown had made different levels of sound so that it wouldn't have startled her so much. She did eventually get used to it."
3,Good if I used it!,I think I would like this if I actually used it. I purchased with the intention of using but I never even opened the package :(
3,OKAY PRODUCT,This is an okay product. I'm not a cat trainer or anything just a pet owner. It does make a loud sound that my cat will notice. But not the right product for me.
1,Shipping takes a decade!,It's been almost a month and I have yet to receive my product...so I'm waiting to receive my refund. I buy things from Amazon all the time and receive them on time OR early. I found it odd to wait for ONE clicker that costed me $8..when I could easily get a three pack for the same price. Complete waste of time...
1,worthlessT,The only reason I purchased this was to get enough for free freight. It affects my dog in no way. She pays no attention to it. Would not purchase again .
5,Easy to use trainig tool,Cuts the learning time in half. Both our dogs enjoy doing tricks now. For years our careful sedate dog never understood what we wanted before and now she learns easily.
5,This is a great tool for training my dogs.,This is a great tool for training my dogs. I have only had it for a short while but it is working out well for us; we are both being trained. I click it once and give the command to stop I click it twice and give the command to go. They are getting use to just the clicks. I click it several times and give the command to stop barking. It works and it is an excellent price.
5,Clicker Training Our 8 Week Old Husky Pup,"I have never used the clicker training system with a dog before. But so far within the two weeks of us having our husky puppy it has definately got her attention. For only being 8 weeks old we can get her to sit, lay down, and give paw 75% of the time. And it has definately drawn her attention to look at our faces. Love it so far and we have only had it for about a week. I decided on this one after reading someone's review stating it was too loud. I was not real fond of the ones I found at local pet stores because I didn't feel they were loud enough to get her attention."
4,"Great Durability, but VERY Loud.","I'm a whole-hearted believer in clicker trainer and this clicker is very durable -- it can keep up with training sessions for as long as you and your dog can! However, it's extremely loud, even to the point of hurting MY ears after a while. Imagine how a dog must feel after hearing it 10 or so times. To fix this, I shoved some wads of paper towel down in the three gaps in the blue plastic surrounding the orange button. It still clicks every time I press it, but the sound is more muffled and less harsh. It's easier on my ears, so it must be easier on any dog's."
4,Works fine,"Durable; seems like it will hold up fine. No problems with it at all. Is it worth the money? I suppose so, but I have nothing to compare it with..."
2,Broke before it ever had the chance to click.,"I give this product two stars for flimsy construction. The orange button popped off after I dropped it on the floor seconds after I took it out of the packaging. This is my first clicker purchase so I can't compare it's construction to another clicker, but it seemed to have broken fairly easy for it's profession. The clicker still clicks, but it is disappointing to have to buy a new one--a different one."
2,Too loud for some dogs,This clicker is so loud that it scared my dog. I have to re-accustom him to it each session. I am ordering one with a softer sound.
5,Question?,"I had to give this a review to ask the question ;) Sorry.I have a Yorkshire Terrier that consistently barks. I don't want to use one of those 'shock' collars. I was wondering if this would work, i.e., I would click it each time she barked. Would the noise be enough to stop her from barking?Thanks."
3,it's okay,"el producto es como lo descripto, ahora a probarlo y ver si funciona, esperemos que si, mas novedades cuando tenga resultados"
1,My dog was terrified of this clicker!!!,"I was hoping to begin clicker training with my mini schnauzer/shih tzu mix dog who turned 1 year in July heard the clicker and immediately ran to her crate. I put it in my pocket as suggested at a dog forum and just clicked it randomly and as soon as she heard it, she ran to her crate again. Now she doesn't trust ANY time I put my hand in my pocket. I had to throw it away. So much for clicker training."
3,Overall very good,I would say I love this clicker but the last one I had lasted about a day. It could be constructed a little better but it is one of the better ones I've found and the click is very audible.
5,"A great, high-quality clicker!",I am impressed with the quality of this clicker. It clicks loudly enough for your loyal hound to hear at a distance and is quite durable. The color makes it easy to find if dropped. The plastic is very high quality and it has held up well in the cold rain of Portland winters. I would definitely recommend this clicker. A nice product at an affordable price.
3,Too loud. Dog associates it with Fear of Death.,"If I wanted a device that makes our 10 lb. mini dachshund disappear, this would have been great. The clicker is really loud, and our poor dog is pretty confident that this clicker is a precursor to the apocalypse. Then again, rustling tin foil and yarn fall into this category, too."
2,gave up.....,gave up.....StarMark Clicker Dog Training System....had high hopes but...my dogs haven't a clue and did not work for my dogs at all....oh well
1,Weak,"So weak.....dog might has well laughed... Actually he did, he ate the entire thing...better luck with a shock collar for sure"
3,Learn to use your own voice!,"Your own voice can make any tone, and project it with much volume, so that for the most part no devices are needed. I didn't buy or watch any videos, read any books or received any advice from other pet owners. I've had dogs in my family since birth, and I've always used mouth sounds, (such as clicks, tones, very high pitched whistles - thanks to my imperfect teeth - and other sounds, words, body and eye gestures) to communicate to my dogs from any reasonable distance. Dogs are quick to pick up on these signals if you treat them well and are consistent with your behavior.I'm sure the clicker works fine, but use you're own voice. There are many advantages to doing things that are natural to your own body. It feels good to communicate with your dog this way, because they know it's coming from you, which is in itself important. And it's free!"
1,Keep your money !!,Keep your money ... I got this for our new puppy ... It did NOT WORK at all ... I might add we have 6 cats also and none of them acted like it did a thing... So being it did nothing for 7 pets... It is safe to say this is a waist of money big time !!!!
5,Dog training clisker,"I think this product was more fun for me then the dogs, I have little guys and they were afraid of it,but boy does it work"
3,much too loud,"This clicker is too loud. I'm sure it would be fine in training my pet but everyone else in my house would also be hearing this clicker. I prefer:Karen Pryor i-Click Dog Training Clicker, 3 ClickersShe's the one who began clicker training and has an amazing book called:Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training."
5,Great Little Clicker,"Some people think that this clicker is loud, but I think it's just right. It is loud enough to pique my dog's interest and grab his attention. After conditioning I was able to successfully teach him new tricks, which involved back-end awareness, touch, and even to stand up after sitting. Thus far it has worked wonders.Oh, and I own an English bulldog, which are known to be difficult to train, stubborn, and not so intelligent. This clicker has helped a great deal."
1,Stupid clicker keeps separating on me!,This clicker is horrible! I'm hardly a novice but the back seam (at the narrow end) isn't sealed and about half the time you click this clicker it comes apart! Don't waste your money! There are many better clickers out there!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CLICKER!!!!,"Complete rip off, this thing is a piece of junk save yourself the $4.44 and buy a $0.99 clicker from your local pet store that actually works. Better yet, buy 4 of them for less than the price of this one and don't worry about losing or breaking them because you have 3 spares!!!"
3,It clicks,It clicks. I neeed to have twenty works to complete this review so what can I say about a clicker. It clicks well.
3,Not so durable but good product,"I was given one of these clickers from my dog trainer and I liked it at first. However, about a week into it i was sitting on the floor training Chomper and I raised my hand, the clicker flew out, hit the wood floor and the orange button fell off. You can still use it by putting your hand into the hole where the button was and clicking but its pretty annoying now to use.I was sad."
3,Scared my dog.,"Maybe this says more about my dog than the product, but he was instantly frightened of the noise and, eventually, the object itself. Perhaps it's too loud or too sharp. I had to get him to not fear the thing before I could even begin training him with it. By that point, he'd been fairly well voice-trained, I just gave up on it."
5,StarMark clicker training system,Can't beat the price a real bargain Very easy to learn when viewing the videos and reading the training guide
5,This is pretty cool.,"I love this productm its so loud my siberian husky puppy pays automatic attention. i tried using a snapple lid but it didnt work at all, the sound was so low i couldnt even hear. this was only 4 bucks so i gave it a shot!"
3,It does the trick,"but it's louder than I though. I've been using the iClick from Karen Prior training my dog, but wanted to try the StarMark for seen it before with a friends, before I had a dog. And as soon as I was trying it inside the apartment it kinda scared my 4 months old Min Pin. But if you but if you are outside or in a busy environment it does the trick."
4,One is not enough.,"When training your dog, this does seem to help them associate good behavior and treats. But... if this is how you plan to train your dog, I would recommend that you have several or that you attach this one to your wrist. Having a clicker is not a must! Love & Attention does fine on it's own. Pros: Good tool to show tricks in a 10 minute session. Cons: it's something that can easily be misplaced if you use in basic training for good behavior."
1,Doesn't work,I tried this for a week and have up. decided to just say good girl and give a treat. She picked that UP instantly. This ..not so much.
4,Just started to use,"I got this because it was a sale, with my order, so I am trying it now, it seems to work good with my pup, it is not to loud like some other people said"
3,Too Easy to Accidentally Click,"I don't recommend this clicker if you plan to be multi-tasking while training your dog. Because the button sticks out, it's too easy to make an unintentional click. The last thing you want to do is click when your dog has just lunged with the leash to go chase a squirrel (unless, of course, you're teaching your dog to lunge and chase squirrels). I've gone back to using my simple box clicker, especially when going on walks: because the click part is recessed, I find I don't get any accidental clicks. I'll use this button clicker if training is all I'm doing and there's nothing else to hold in my hand."
5,wonderful bach recording,"It is really one of my best CD. I have especially enjoyed the playing of G. Leonhardt which is dynamic, with an incredible master (virtuosity) and sense of harmony. This CD offers an rare energy and is in the same time deep, as any of Bach. I recommend it to anyone who wants to discover Harpsichord, which is not at all a weak instrument. With its small price, it is an essential CD (this concerto is not included in G Leonhardt edition)."
5,Excellent!!!,The quality of this recording is one of the best of Leonhardt's production in keeping with the dacade in which it was taken. Excellent stuff for a Leonhardt's collector.
4,Great performances but ridiculous packaging,"What is Sony doing?? These are great performances by Leonhardt but all you get here is a CD. No notes whatsoever - no information on where this recording came from, what year, or even who is playing besides Gustav Leonhardt. For a nearly full-price CD this is totally unacceptable!Here are my best guesses:Gustav Leonhardt with Leonhardt ConsortRecording date: 11/1981Venue: Lutherse Kerk, Haarlem, Netherlands"
1,Minimal Value as a Curiosity Only,"I have read General Giap's work both in the original Vietnamese and in English. There is little to no valuable insight contained within the political dogma and Party rhetoric that fills this puffed-up praise of General Giap. The reader should keep in mind this work was not originally published to discuss the strategy and tactics of the final push to capture the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, it was published to praise General Giap and portray him to the Vietnamese people as a hero of the Communist Party who outwitted and defeated the foreign invaders, thus placing Giap in a class with other heroes of Vietnamese history such as Le Loi and the 2 Trung Sisters. This is NOT a serious analysis of the final events of the Vietnam war, and offers little promise other than to satisfy a curiosity for how the Communist Party interprets history for the people of Vietnam."
3,"Brilliant,, relavent today as 1976. Must read for Al Quaida","Very useful for the insurgent in you. Especially, enlightening is where Giap said that organizations such as ""Viet Nam Vets Against the War"" (started by John Kerry) gave the North courage and resolve."
2,Almost Garbage,"First, this is published by an extreme left-wing anti-US military company. It is forwarded by pointless political propaganda.However, this follows the theme of the entire book. While there is some useful strategic information in Giap's words, you have to wade through tons of Communist ideology to siphon out a few ounces of outdated information.At best, this is a diluted companion to other more informative texts. Or for indoctrination into any pro-Communist anti-U.S. group."
4,fantastic!,"It was great to hear this remake..i expected it to be not so good, but hey what was i thinking?..I should know the Rednex wouldn't let me down.Sang by new singer Scarlet and the original Guy Goran, its got great new beats ...buy it, if it does not already exist in your collection.Great new dance mixes too..my favourite being, Aquagen"
5,Anche in Italia...,"Anche in Italia si fa rock con i controcoglioni e questa ne è una dimostrazione lampante. E' il miglior album dei LITFIBA insieme a ""Terremoto"". Grande il sound grezzo(grazie a Parashar)che instaura un'atmosfera particolare.""Mondi sommersi"" non era male, ma ""Infinito"" fa cagare... Spirito è un'album dove traspare una band che si diverte e che fa divertire!!!"
5,A review from Down Under,"A wonderful movie for all age groups, that even in Australia is relatively unknown. Bud Tingwell was a very well-known Australian actor, but I haven't even seen this film on TV since the 1990s. Ned, the star of the film, is the cutest little boy, and his belief that Father Christmas (Santa for all you Americans!) will come, no matter what else happens, is so wonderfully innocent. It takes us all back to our own childhoods. When will they bring this movie out on DVD so we can continue to enjoy it in the future?? If you still have a VHS player, buy this tape."
5,A different sort of Christmas,"I love to watch this movie every Christmas! The story concerns a family living in Australia in the 1800's. Australia is very hot at Christmas, because their summer is then, so the holiday gets celebrated very differently. During the story, a drought is on and everything is dying. The family is very poor and can't afford to buy gifts but their little boy is sure that ""Father Christmas"" whom he thinks he's met in person, will get him a gift if he's good. When a scoundrel pretending to be Father Christmas, and the local rich man get involved, it becomes a Christmas none of them ever forget. The movie has one scene that would make it worth watching anyway, even if it weren't a good movie: the scene where they try to have a traditional English Christmas (complete with Yule log in 100 + weather) and the roasted pig takes a header across the room. You'll love it!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I am an intermediate level website developer. I thought this would be an great book. When I received it the first thing I did was turn to the chapter on embedding Flash videos. I quickly discovered that 9 out of 10 figures/screenpics in the chapter were for the wrong topic! It is the most error filled book I have ever bought. Even the website listed as the books ""support"" site is for a different company! I have bought hundreds of books over the last decade. This is the first one I have ever returned because it was so poorly proofread. Also, the publisher has no ""errata"" site, and did not return my email asking for help. Matt"
2,Full of errors -- companion website doesn't work!,"This book turned out to be a big disappointment. For one, I found too many errors. There are numerous misspellings and incorrect information. For instance, part of the book defines a JPEG as a ""glossy compression format"". If I hadn't read numerous other books about JPEG files, I might not have noticed this. The author should have defined a JPEG as a ""lossy"" format.. not ""glossy"". I can handle a few errors and misspellings. However, the biggest issue I have with this book is the ""companion"" website. As many readers of training or technical books know, companion websites are important when learning. This book requests that the reader download samples files from it's companion website. Unfortunately, the website is defunct. This is a fairly new book and should be more current than it is. This book had potential, but just didn't meet my basic accuracy requirements. This book turned out to be more frustration than it's worth."
1,Awful,"Reasons not to buy this book: (1) has an invalid website (which is referred to MANY times in this book). How are you to train with this book when supplemental materials aren't even available? I agree with other readers -- this is VERY annoying. (2) Like other readers, I found numerous mistakes. It's obvious this book was rushed to press. I emailed the authors/publishers in early Jan 2005, and I still haven't heard anything about their site or list of errata. VERY DISSAPOINTING! Maybe I can find someone to buy this book from me, but I doubt it."
1,Aaarrggg,"This book is like wading thru glue. It references people and times without explaing why people disliked/like them. It adds confusion by jumping around wihtout transition or explination, and worse, it is awash with phrases and quotations in French with no translation. If I could read French, I would not need a book in English to learn about the ""Sun King."""
2,Louis XIV,"The book's title appears to me to be misleading, inasmuch as rather than a chronological biography, as the title would seem to entail, it is a somewhat loose assembly of anecdotes relating to the Sun King's lifelong passion for the construction of royal palaces, interspersed with descriptions of his battles. I found that the portrait of the man, both as an individual and as a king, highlighting either his private or public life, or both, and the man's impact on history, with the whole coherently and cogently presented in a clear prose, was sorely missing. In sum, I found the book to be unfocused, uninformative, rambling and at times boring."
2,Unorganized and difficult to follow,"It's amazing to me when an author takes a potentially fascinating person, and writes in a way that is both confusing and somewhat boring. As a history teacher with a degree in European history I found many of the chapters hard to follow. There is rarely any explanantion or foundation of the people being described. The author seems to assume the reader has inside knowlege of the titles and social structure of the French court and French language. Overall I found the book to be disjointed and hard to follow. It is the type of book that made me feel as though I should read another biography of Louis XIV to understand this obne."
2,Louis XIV,"While I own and have enjoyed reading many of Ian Dunlop's books, I found this one disappointingly ponderous and exhausting. Really tough sledding. I sent it back. Other works on Louis XIV are far more interesting and entertaining."
3,"Specialists beware, others should enjoy","Academic reviewers have been a bit sniffy about this book. It's true that Dunlop scatters quotations throughout the book without a footnote to be seen. He also makes some careless errors of fact. For example on p.432 he claims that Lully was composing music in 1710, when he had been dead for 23 years.However, readers who are not worried about its lack of scholarly rigour should find this a very enjoyable book. Dunlop has a delightfully easy going style and an eye for the enlivening anecdote. It would be hard to write a dull book about such an extraordinary monarch as Louis XIV and Dunlop's biography is not a bad place to make his acquaintance.Those who want to meet Louis face to face, as it were, should seek out Lucy Norton's three volume edition of Saint Simon's Versailles memoirs."
5,A very competent treatment,"I have long wanted to read a biography of Louis XIV and when I saw this new one I decided I had to read it. I think it does a very good job, and shows that there were good things about Louis XIV as well as bad. I have know since I was a child that he was succeeded by his great-grandson, and this book makes that knowledge meaningful, as it tells of the deaths of his son and grandson not too long before Louis's own death on Sept 1, 1715. Does someone know of a good biography of Louis XV?"
1,"Go concept, poor design","I purchased this ""Mix & Go"" cup because I am active in the gym and like to drink shakes as I work out. Mostly, I mix my shakes at home using a blender before going to the gym and would have to mix it more by shaking the container once at the gym. I thought the ""Mix & Go"" would make the process easier as I would have a travel mixer. The whisk incorporates the shake mix well, but I found out, by force of habit, the cup is not at all spill proof when shaking the drink. The concept is good, yet the design needs lots of work to keep your drink from spilling out when the cup is tilted. This was a bad investment."
2,Hand hel mixer,"This product is not very useful, it does not totally mix your products together. I was using it for protein shakes, and it simply does not mix them completely."
2,I will never again purchase anything like this or recommend to anybody,The longer I keep it the lesser I like it. It does not mix the chocolate in cold or hot milk. Leaves the chocolate stick to the sides of the container. It is slow and weak. I always end mixing with my electrical hand mixer or a bit longer with a spoon
1,defected,I didn't expect the item to come defected. At first it would start only when I twist the attachment while it was on. That didn't bother me that much. Then it stopped working no matter what I did. Sometimes you will here a sound but that's all. I don't even know if it is worth the money to return because I received it with free shipping. Buyer beware.
3,Shooter with ghosts not survival/horror,"This is a fun game that I put aside for a while and came back too. It's not really my kind of game, but I thought the quality is high enough that I continued playing it and finishing it. Initially I was disappointed with it because I'm more a fan of the ""survival/horror"" genre, and this one is more like a shooter with ghosts as your targets instead of flesh and blood enemies. Not that original really. It is what it is. The superntaural twist made it fun at times, but it wasn't scary in the least, and at times I turned it off, tired of just shooting at stuff. Still, the graphics and control are better than average. A safe bet for just about anyone."
3,"Unique Game, Headache inducing Slowdown","Being a huge fan of Primal and enticed by what the previews offered. I was eagerly looking forward to Ghosthunter, buying it the day it came out. While the enviroments and eniemies and level design are top class. The game is horribly marred by frustrating gameplay and controls and can be amazingly frustrating with slowdown and flickering that mars the otherwise jaw-dropping graphics."
3,Awesome Graphics give it 5 stars but...,"Ghosthunter has amazing graphics. I give it 5 stars because it's an original. Where it's lacking is the erratic camera that you can manipulate with one of the L buttons, but which still is way off. As I said though the graphics are amazing rich detailed enviroments and characters brought to life with a decent array of voice talent! As another person mentioned I too found the controls a bit to get used to. But I couldn't get over the look of this game. The cutscenes are excellent.If they took this game back to the drawing board with some normal folks to give them some opinions on what the game actually comes across as it would be amazing!I hope they take this game back to the drawing board and refine the mistakes, but still it's an enjoyable game once you get used to it. If you frustate easily this isn't the game for you, but if you have the patience of a saint go for it:)"
5,interesting,the interviews with the stars just shows they are like everybody else who experience paranormal phenomena. I liked that they talked about what was going on in their lives prior to the experience and their emotions after that. Good dvd and will probably buy more in the future.
2,Barron's Editing Policy Needs Serious Review,"The amount of typographical errors is truly astounding for a book that has passed through 9 editions. The answer keys have so many errors that the book is of dubious merit. If the student realizes the answer the book gives is wrong then hopefully s/he has the means to find the right answer. Otherwise, the student is just left insecure, frustrated, or mislead. Upon what survey do they make their claim that this is such a popular book???The editors really, really need to proof read their text better - it is literally embarrassing. The current level is not competent enough to be deemed professionally done.If this book is representative, would I trust them for further books like SAT Preparation? They must do better than this to be competitive."
2,Not as I expected,I bought it because it was the best bestseller among its kind.It has a lot of typos. The book is not well organized.
1,Apalling!,This terribly edited book does NOT include any ISEE info for the Lower Level test. Can you sue them for malpractice?? I wonder.
2,SAD SAD SAS,"COMPARED TO HER OTHER WORK,THIS SEEMS PRETTY SAD TO ME. WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTENED BEFORE I BOUGHT."
2,Poor Les,"Les McCann should sue. The version of ""Compared to What,"" which is almost pure imitation, is awful. The album as a whole reflects the sad state of jazz these days. This isn't new--or enjoyable."
2,First half is just filler,"The real story doesn't begin until the middle of the book.It told me what I thought I wanted to know, but now I'm disgusted by the same."
3,A Bit Tedious,"Jack Olsen is an experienced writer, and this book reflects it, however it is not nearly as well done as many I have read, including a few of his. He offers exhaustive research into the Houston area and Police Force, far more than necessary to set the stage. Extremely distracting was his need to convey dialect by spelling words phonectically as pronounced by the average Houstoner instead of simply using a few idioms and phrasing to make the dialogue realistic. After awhile, it became painful to wade through any lenthy conversation. I also found the book difficult to follow, lacking continuity and direction.On the other hand, the subject matter is quite astounding and he has researched it well. For that reason, I would recommend it to those who would not be terribly put off by the problems I've described. He is a good writer, I just think he could have done better."
4,"Good book, but.....................","This is probably the most accurate version of the Dean Corll story I've ever read, only I think the author made a mistake by not including pictures. If there were some crime-scene photos and pictures of the killers and victims, the book would have been 100% better. The Dean Corll case is one of the scariest, most horrible cases of serial murder ever purpetrated and I find it amazing that, with all the forensic/murder shows on TV these days, NOBODY has ever devoted one program covering the Dean Corll/Wayne Henly case."
3,I wouldn't pay much for this book,"Another incomplete hastily written account of the Houston Mass Murders. Of the three books written back in the 70's this one would be considered the best since the choices are limited. Olsen had a great imagination in writing this book. Save your money!A new book should be released within the next year or two titled ""The Girl on the Torture Board... The Truth about the 1973 Houston Mass Murders"" by Rhonda Williams. She is the female survivor that was there the morning that Wayne Henley Jr. killed Dean Corll. She grew up with many of the victims, including her fiance. She has researched the event throughly and wants the truth to be revealved so that this may not happen to someone else. Keep an eye out for the new book. It WILL be a must have for all true crime collectors."
2,Not Happy,"At first I was very happy with the story that was being told UNTIL the writer started to use an accent that was terrible. I mean half of the words that he was trying to make sound like an accent were just, well stupid. I know people talk that way in the south, but he did not have to use the accent in the book it made for bad reading and too much time trying to figure out what these people were trying to say. It is really too bad this could of been a really good book."
1,Could Have Been Interesting But...,"I bought this book because I found Olsen to be a good writer of True Crime. This book was terrible. His approach was from the viewpoint of the victims family and he unfortunately decided to try and spell out their Texas accents. It was comical. I am from Texas and I have never heard... ""plice"" for place...""Lard"" for Lord...""harse"" for horse...etc... Even Gomer Pyle would have been emabarrassed. It was so distracting that it made this most interesting story a tiresome read."
4,GOOD READ FOR BEGINNERS,This was a cover to cover read in one sitting. Was very informative in most ways. But I was looking for more detail.I have been into model railroading a LONG time. But new to Garden RailRoads.
4,A Thoroughly Delightful Little Novel,"The author, Mr. Rodgers, has used the story of the ancient mythological Sumerian gods to remind us of the constant battle between the forces of Light and the forces of Darkness, which has been played out on Earth time and time again. I like the way he wrapped his story around, especially the Book of Revelations, depicting the final battle. It is an easy, enjoyable read."
2,Not same as shown on the picture,"This is not the solid pack filter my car originally had, but better than the ""charcolized"" I have seen from other supplies.There is about 1/8"" mat with media between multi-folded between the box ends. I decided to keep it as I am not driving in polluted areas and hard to beat $19 and free shipping. However for those who need real chemical filter spend $100 for REAL OEM."
2,Klass: the Ultimate Spin-Master,"As an F-104 pilot who chased a ""UFO"" across South Carolina towards Bermuda at speeds up to 1300kts and altitudes exceeding 65,000 ft msl in 1966, I find Mr Klass's explanations of this incident, and indeed, all UFO activity, to be highly suspect. Perhaps in this instance I too was chasing nothing more than a high altitude weather balloon. Or perhaps, what I saw was a flock of very fast, high flying geese. Or perhaps, even swamp gas, (over the ocean?). I for one would like to see a real investigative study into what goes here, not another sophmoric miscreant explanation that seems prevalent from Mr Klass."
5,If you love English tea,I lived in Ireland and England for a long time and the American tea we have is just too weak for me- I'll end up putting four tea bags in a single cup and it still tastes like water. These Typhoo are great ....I can't decide if I like these the best or Barry's Tea (try them both!).
1,This is AWFUL tea!,"There's something for everyone in this world but this tea is not for me! I found the taste downright earthy. Borderline repugnant and not worth drinking. I tossed the cup out after the 3rd sip, made another cup and tossed that out after the 1st sip. Then I threw it ALL out. Very, VERY disappointing. I didn't even find the aroma enticing. I'll stick with Barry's red or PG Tips, thanks."
2,shelved ( to remove from active service - to put off or aside ),"Cr*ppy in house video !His high vocals were shot...he could have backed off a little it would have helped !Mixing board / sound guy was asleep...would have been nice to hear the lead guitar without turning my volume to 99%.I've always dug the ""TOYS"" but this was a cr*p release from a band that can still rock.Watched once and shelved ( to remove from active service - to put off or aside )"
3,Not much music for a lot of money,"This CD single includes the original version of London, which you already have if you have the Release album. It also includes ""Positive Role Model"" which is a dance song. Then the is the version of London with just singing and the piano, which is nice. However, with just 3 tracks and 12 minutes of music, you decide if it is worth it. It seems like London 1 & 2 could have easily been put on the same cd for a better value."
4,A must have single for fans,"The piano version of ""London"" makes this single a must have for any PSB fan. When you add the PSB version of ""Positive Role Model"" from the ""Closer to Heaven"" musical it becomes an even sweeter deal."
3,Just Ok but only a few song's bring about a heart of worship,"I do like the fact that our Youth can enjoy Music with out Sex,Drugs,and Self. I just am sad about the lack of true Doctrinal Theme to these song's that are more POP than Truth. Great beat and good vocal's on some and they accomplish what they mean to.Dont ever forget the true sweetness of the Hynm's and the attitude of Worship He requires.Never desire POP-Christian Song's more than His WORD,Lord may it never be.Amen"
3,Pretty decent Lifetime flick,"This movie was actually made for TV way back in the late 90's, and it's as good now as it was then. It's about a 15 year old girl who has a crush on her high school teacher, who is married with kids. He has a thing for young girls and they soon begin having an affair, and things get messy. He holds all the power and her experiences really give insight into how these teacher/student affairs work. It's a great movie with many familiar actors. It's worth seeing!"
1,DVD,the movie was a bomb. the movie did not show at all. a very big disappointment and waste of time.
3,Dissapointed,"The only reason I bought this is because the box said DVD 3 included the Wings concert film ""Rockshow"" finally after all these years.Once I unsealed it and put the dvd into the player, I was surprised to see that there were only a handful of songs from the film included!If you're looking for the FULL Rockshow film, it's not in this set!"
1,Why can't we get what we want,I am a true blue Beatles and Mcartney fan but a DVD is never put out where it is all actuall live footage of Paul performing.I don't care about seeing the Kremiln or bits and pieces of footage from individual MTV videos. Why can't you put out in order a 6 DVD set of his live concerts with no comentary. Just pure unaltered music concerts and eveninclude some footage of the Beatles. NOW that would be great.
5,"Worth every penny, so shut up!","For me, I'm sick and tired of all the McCartney nay-sayers blasting this latest Macca release. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Does it have every possible McCartney video rarity that's out there? Again, no. Did they mess around with the old video to make it look like it was filmed in the modern age? Sure, they did. The bottom line is that this is such a wonderful collection of Paul's life's work since the Beatles split, that none of this matters. It's bloody Paul McCartney, so shut up!"
3,QUALITY MCCARTNEY,"There are a lot of negatives written about recent Beatle releases. in this case about what videos are missing, the incomplete Rockshow, blah blah blah. This is a great collection, not complete, but not advertised as such. the picture outside of rockshow is great, sound fabulous, very tastefully done as usual by paul.i was expected to be disappointed after reading reviews here. if 6 hours of paul for 25.00 is not a good deal i dont know what is. hey its paul in dts!! you can turn off the tube and listen to music in dts. fabulous! the commentary is good as well. im sure things that people want will come out eventually. be patient. for now. good job paul!!"
5,McCartney Years DVD Set is Amazing!,"Wow! What more can be said. The McCartney Years DVD is packed with great stuff. It's difficult to properly put together any one collection that can adequately capture the huge volume of work McCartney has created. Howerver, this DVD set gives it a great go! If you're a McCartney fan, this is an absolute must have. Period."
4,Not perfect but very good!,"Okay, so it's missing alot of classic McCartney videos and the concert footage is incomplete BUT this is still a very good release. To me, the commentary track on alot of the songs makes this a worthwhile set. Yes, I would have liked the COMPLETE One Hand Clapping special but nobody has mentioned that this set does contain portions of it in the menus(several on the menus show complete portions of individual songs taken from the special). At least that's something to be happy about."
2,DTS 5.1 Sound,The McCartney Years DVD sound track is in DTS 5.1 surround & PCM Stereo. There is no Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound track on this DVD.
4,Very worthwhile dvd,"A very nice set of 3 dvds. Why four stars and not 5?...because some of the songs on disc 2 are weak...Spies Like Us, for example. Video quality in most cases is outstanding with CRISP PICTURE AND GREAT COLORS. SOME OF THE OLDER VIDEOS THAT WERE MADE USING FILM, AS OPPOSED TO VIDEOTAPE, ARE LITTLE GRAINY...BUT OVERALL VERY, VERY, GOOD. Widescreen versus full screen, who cares? I'm not a vidiot. Disc 3 with the live footage is great. The Unplugged segment (made with videotape and not film) is of great quality, both sound and picture. I highly recommend this for classic rock fans, as well as McCartney geeks."
2,Barely worth the asking price,"For someone who hasn't seen (or heard) all of Sir Paul's hit solo records, this would be a good sampler. However, if you already have most of his albums (or seen these videos before) this compilation would not be of interest. One reason is that many of the videos are hard to watch because of irrelevant content quickly cut together into a blur of images having little to do with the song. My biggest problem is that the picture quality leaves much to be desired: it's dark and fuzzy with faded colors. The sound is OK, but all of these should have been remastered for such an ambitious collection. An example of this is the 'Eleanor Rigby' segment from ""Give My Regards to Broadstreet"" movie. It looks and sounds much better on the original movie DVD, if you already have it. There are a couple of nice interviews, and the commentary tracks give a bit of extra insight, but you can tell that not a lot of money was spent on this production."
5,A must have for Beatle McCartney Fans.,Some will compare this to the Beatles Anthology from several years ago. Just a fantastic historical timeline. The technical composition of the McCartney story is also impressive as you can pick anywhere in time - by song or performance- and you do not need to sit through the whole thing at once. So watch by you Fav song or performance or watch it in order but most of all watch it several times because there are all sorts of hidden reels of movies and clips that are buried within each menu and level. Nicely done! Guaranteed a fantastic time for all and for all ages.
4,THE MCCARTNEY YEARS,"Will be a great dvd if the videos are all complete. We all know paul likes to talk during the begining, middle and end of songs, especially his concert films, which is alright at times, but we've all waited long enough to see these videos uninterupted and in their entirety. looking foward to it."
3,"Good to Have, but Could Be Better","It's nice to have a collection of his post-beatle work in one set, but I thought the sound and visual qualities would be better - especially the earlier ones. After seeing DVDs like the WHO's ""The Kids Are Alright"" and Led Zeppelin's, I naturally expected McCartney's version to be in the similar ballpark.But still, thinking about battling with the huge VCR back in those days and then the search for each track among the hundreds of tapes, it is nice to have everything - well almost - in one place.Whether or not each of the shows on the third disc should have been complete, is just another story for me. I hope the complete versions of those shows - should they ever come out remastered - will have better quality, especially ""Rock Show"".For now, I can well settle with this set. I'm only giving three stars because I know McCartney can do better."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Having had looked forward to this DVD for quite a while, I have to say that I was disappointed. I had imagined that this was going to be the definitive release of all of McCartney's videos, but that is not the case. As others have mentioned there are lots of videos that are missing from this collection. But the biggest problem that I found was the poor quality of the picture. Most of the videos look like they have been transferred from a videocassette. The so called ""mastering"" seems like either it was lie or that it was rushed by incompetent technicians. Even the recent videos from the 80's (Tug of War, Pipes of Peace, Take it Away) are so poor that I can't believe that the original source material was not available. They all just lack sharpness and clarity. Take a look at the recent re-release of Help from 1965 and see how crystal clear that picture is. The sound on this DVD is superb but overall this was a letdown. I'll still be waiting for the definitive collection."
5,"Finally, a McCartney video history!!","At this writing, we are a little more than two months away from the release of this Macca DVD collection and this is going to be great!! Videos, commentary, live material....who can ask for more? From Macca's wonderful ""Memory Almost Full"" CD to this DVD set, it's great to be alive now! Beatles forever!!"
5,"As always, it's great!","This was very much worth buying. I have been a fan for most all of my life, and a few of these videos and concert footage I haven't seen quite a long time. He could have released 1/2 of this material for the same price and I would have bought it, so I can't say that I agree with everyone stating how much is missing. For one thing, if you really do collect this guy's work, do you realize how much material you would have to choose over??? Really, this is a nice collection of songs and footage from my favorite musician. Maybe we can hope for McCartney Years II???"
3,"okish, couda, shouda been better......no excuses","Come on, this is Paul Maccartney! Why didnt Rhino make this a 4 or 5 DVD set!So much is missing. I agree with one reviewer, they shouda left off the concert teasers on DVD #3 and just threw in more music videos and released the concert footage on a separate 2 or 3 DVD set with the complete shows.The videos for some reason are not listed in chronologocal order, but in the menu button, you can choose to play them that way.Overall, its the best commercially DVD by Sir Paul you can buy, but as usual, the bootleggers offer a better package."
1,"No Complete RockShow, No $",So I guess it'll be ANOTHER 10 years for the Wings concert to get fully released. WTF? Why does Paul hate Wings so much? Is it money sharing issues? Is it that much of a cost burden due to film transfer restoration? This is disappointing.
4,Wildflowers Review,"Good read, excellent pics, is recommended for 7th and 8th grade Science classes. Good price, excellent value!"
4,very informative,"A truly beautiful book. I walk in the fields and identify most of the flowers. There is one however, that I can't seem to find in the book. Will send a picture of it, if you like. Please advise. rosalee"
4,Good product - poor service,"When I received the product it was exactly what I was looking for and was in good condition. However, with the product was a sheet that indicated that the company only accepted returns on defective merchandise and not liking the product was not a reason for a return. I bought this for a gift and was unsure if the receiver of the gift would like it or not. Maybe they should include the disclaimer on the website when purchasing."
2,Ended up not using them,"Just installed these. One side matched up very well. The other side was slightly bent in the packaging so I couldn't get it to sit right on the wheel/hub. This caused it to rub against the caliper and I could not clearance it. Do to the noise it was making going down the road, I removed it immediately. Not very pleased with my purchase. May fit well for others though. I do have to say that with the way that these are made, they probably don't have the durability to last through very many rotations. I just have doubts that even if you had a good set that they would be likely to stand up to handling very often. They seem to be made of very thin and flimsy material, like tin. Obviously they have to be thin to fit, but once they are bent, you will spend a lot of time trying to get them to fit correctly again."
5,Essential Bach,"If you're a confirmed Bach-head and lover of contrapuntal music, this is a must recording. Gustav Leonhardt is one of the foremost Bach scholars and master harpsichordists of our time. He and his fellow musicians have given us a beautifully clean and transparent interpretation of Bach's ""Musical Offering"" to Fredrick the Great. Although this is a re-mastered recording from 1974, it is sonicly very pleasing. Highly recomended."
1,a failure,"What a failure. The first one broke by the bottle holding tab on my second ride. The other one snapped off from the mounting bolts with the water bottle still attached( and no I did not over tighten the bolts) after I went over a rough section of road. I liked the way they hold the bottle but not if they are going to break so easily. I've been biking for aver 35 years and have worked in bike shops, I have never seen such a disaster as these cages."
4,Big improvement over metal holders.,We replaced our metal bottle holders with these. We like that the plastic doesn't scratch the aluminum water bottles we use. The design is also more verstatile in that it doesn't require a ridge on the water bottle to secure it.
3,Serves the pupose,"Not the most heavy duty bottle cage. However it is serviceable, used on a commuter bike. Plus only yellow one I could find."
1,"awful, waste of plastic","In just a couple months, I have gone through at least 5 of these--I'm lucky that my local bike shop has let me swap them out each time they break. The only positive is that they hold my klean kanteens perfectly. But, they break SO easily. They just snap, and when the first one broke, i though I had overtightened it. And then 4 more broke. I'm still trying to find a good cage for Klean kanteens."
3,Stiff and Fragile,"Cages are stiff and won't adapt well to slightly larger bottles like my old nylon cages would. I'm not particularly happy with them but think 3 stars is fair because they in fact do hold the bottle and are lighter than most in their price range. That said, I'm still using my old ones and these are on the shelf."
2,Comatose Vegetables,"The object of Operation Pax is to sap the will power and reduce populations to comatose vegetables, which is exactly the effect it has on the reader. After the bizarre but effective opening, involving the utterly contemptible conman Routh, it runs out of vim. The Oxford scenes are long-winded and singularly unamusing, populated by stereotyped dons and ghastly children of the sort that ought to be strangled at birth. When the action ""shifts gear"" into a more thrillerish line, the book becomes merely dull: chases and abductions are inadequate compensation for an absence of detective interest and the irrelevance of Appleby. At the end, a rather surprising villain is revealed, surprising only because the book relies, as it should never do, on a single clue."
4,If you want to discover the Argentine Tango world,"If you want to discover the Argentine Tango world, the tango lesson is a good movie ... Based on the experience of Sally Potter who met the tanguero Pablo Veron ... Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Paris (France) are the two main cities of tango."
5,Beautiful Soundtrack to a Wonderful Film,"If you are a lover of dancing and haven't seen the film, rent it today. The soundtrack captures both the essence of the film and Argentinian tango. Not all tracks are tango pieces, some are background music. Also included are several fine sung tango pieces. All in all, it is a well crafted soundtrack that both evokes the feeling film's and stands well on its own merit.As a side note, I brought the CD to work recently and several co-workers fell in love with it. So much so that they went out and bought their own copies."
4,some only,"only some of the music was for my liking,all the music from Sally was not tango ae all! and not very pleasantcheers"
3,Only for the Swedish diehards,This is a marvelous movie about the daily lives of Swedish immigrants to the United States.The movie is grainly and only for diehard historical fiction buffs.
5,Very good product,This is like it was described. Actually a little bigger than we thought. Folds nice for easy storage. No more arguing about the score now. The memory is the first to go.... This eliminates any problems.
2,Product = 2/5... Service = Priceless,Merchandise arrived damaged. eSportonline's Customer Service was very professional and acted quickly to resolve the situation. Thank you for making my online purchase a pleasant one.
4,perfect score keeper,"For the type of game that I play, fuzball, it's perfect. We can play up to five matches which is the highest the small numbers go up to. The larger numbers then keep track of the on-going wins. It will be many years before we have to re-set the scoreboard."
4,"How Did ""Titanic"" Beat This?","1997's Tony Award for Best Musical goes to ... ""Titanic""?Cy Coleman & Ira Gasman's terrific score for ""The Life"" is much stronger than that season's other productions: ""Steel Pier"" and the aforementioned ""Titanic"". Maybe the Book needed work. Fortunately, the show will be remembered for its outstanding performances by Tony-Winners Lillias White & Chuck Cooper along with Tony-Nominees Pamela Isaacs & Sam Harris.Best tracks include:The Oldest ProfessionMy BodyHe's No GoodI'm Leaving You""Someday"" Is For SuckersMy FriendThough not as strong as some of Mr. Coleman's other scores (""Sweet Charity"", ""City Of Angels"", & ""The Will Rogers Follies"" come to mind), you'll be hooked after a couple of listens! Let's hope this show gets revived ... and soon!"
4,One of my favorites,"The Life plain RULES! Most of the singers rock, (except Queen) who is a little more operetic than this musical needs. The funk sounds of the early 80's give an authentic sounding feel to the story. The Jazz elements are sure to delight any Jazz/Funk fan. You will not be disappointed with Queen's best friend (in the show) who also appears in the Disney movie HERCULES as one of the MUSES. Check them both out. She is what this musical deserves the most accolade for."
5,Very nice,Arrived fast at a price I thought was reasonable. I have been looking for this recording for a while so I was glad to find it and the seller responded very well.
5,Graduate student in Chemical ENGR,Well thought out presentation of material. Easy to understand and easy and fun to read.
3,Just good or review,"This book is good for review, but it is not good for study because it does not explain very well. Instead, it tries to cover as much information about recent research topics as possible. I don't think it's necessary. However, it's a very good source to review for such tests as GRE, qualify exam."
5,Excellent text,"This is simply one of the best text boks I've come across in my study of chemistry. I plan on going to graduate school in physical chemistry and this book has been extremely helpful. It's well set up, good at explaining concepts, and full of challangeing problems at the end of each chapter. As for the revies that disliked the book's lack of deriving every single equation, I think that anyone who has made it to a course in p-chem should have the math skills required to derive equations in order to master what is a highly mathematicaly driven subject. An excellent book, and one that will stay in my reference library."
1,An unspeakable horror,"If there is ever a book that is worth burning, I would not hesitate to nominate Atkins's Physical Chemistry. This text is an absolute trash, considering its superficially laid out; excessively numerical end-chapter exercises. Nothing spells H-O-R-R-E-N-D-O-U-S better than this garbage.Reading Atkins's is equivalent to a vicarious torture of Nazi magnitude.While the slapshod mathematical treatment might be curiously amusing; the lack of precision and rigor is deeply offending. Apparently, Atkins was more concerned with his line art and numerical data than a little thought in his seemingly mysterious derivations.This book, enough said, is an unforgivable crime to humanity."

3,1997 Symphony by Tan Dun,"When I first heard the excerpt (the prelude) from the TV show ""Classic Arts Showcase"", I was touched by the sounds of the orchestra, the childrens' choir, the ancient bells, and the cello played by Yo-yo Ma. I decided to buy this CD, and this was a lucky choice. The whole music was understandable: mysterious, melancholy, and glorious. I have no disagreement about the composer Tan Dun borrwing some composers' music, especially Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"". But perhpaps this was Tan's best choice. Besides, ""Ode to Joy"" means something like happiness. And Tan Dun's 1997 Symphony has a similar theme, about peace. This may be the only Tan Dun music I may listen, but this CD is perfect for my CD collection. I thank all the staffs, the performers, and the singers for making this music really wonderful. And I especially thank the composer Tan Dun. Shei shei!"
1,"No ""You've got a friend"" in the best of James Taylor","If you buy this book for the song ""You've got a friend"", don't buy it. The song is not in this book which they called the best of James Taylor. This title is incorrect because his greatest hit ""You've got a friend"" is not in it. I was very disappointed when I finally received this book.The songs are ok but don't call a book the best of when the greatest hit is not in it."
3,Good but not great,"There are some songs in here that we couldn't find in other books which is why we purchased it. It's a strange collection of songs but can't complain. I'm not a guitar player, but my husband is. I've been told that almost all popular guitar music is not written correctly. I know that JT has free videos on how to play some of his music so maybe that's a better place to start. i know that he capos so may of his songs so maybe that's why these songs seem to be slightly off at times. We're happy for some of the songs but wish they were a bit more accurate."
2,Overall a disapointment,"Well when I first got this book, I was expecting information on how to use Ghost hunters as enemies in an adventure. While the info is there, most of the book (95% of it) is devoted to playing a ghost hunter. Not a bad idea if most of the organisations weren't incredibly boring. There is a few gems here and there. The Benandanti, for example, are great in any adventure. But bright spots aside this book was a letdown. Your better of with Mediums: Speakers with the Dead. Overall a much better book."
5,Nasal buzzbomb reintegrates sound & sense,"Stop. Turn around. Yeah, he's there. Spooky. Words that drive ""like a dirty little sob"" into the brainstem where they sit, where they'll sit, until you're over. & he'll be standing there. Spooky. ""the sky fills with oranges during the war."" this man is huge. forget rollins, jessee is where burroughs & bukowski meet, & his eyes are not averted. thanks."
4,More Noise Please!,"SJB takes you there with this collection. Where? Where do you want to go? There is a brutal, compelling yet strangely compassionate voice at work here. In an age when poetry is often either safely bucolic or full of naval gazing indulgences or the like this fiercely honest work will open up parts of your head, heart and soul that may perhaps have become a little woolly. The musical backing works well for the most part, only occasionally falling into 'beat' cliches. Will you play it regularly? Perhaps not. Will you play it often? Yes. Every now and then your brain will call out for that sardonic voice and the pictures it places in your head and you'll give it a spin and perhaps think 'There but for...' whilst simultaneously thanking whatever you have to thank for SJB going there and recording it for you. Life, warts and all."
5,A Unique Masterpiece of Words,"Don't be afraid, this poetry will not hurt you. When most people hear Steven Berstein's voice, they get frightened because of it's deep, harsh tone. Keep listening! This is an important voice that will enlighten your sense of imagination, make you laugh, get nervous, and maybe change the way you think or see the world."
3,Mediocre and ugly,"I was surprised at how well reviewed these were. There are some strong points, but overall I wish I'd gone with a different pair.Pros:Large enough to fit over most glassesDoesn't fog up at allVents are large enough to fit fingers in to adjust glassesDecent, secure strapsCons:HUGE! I mean I have a good sized melon and I look like I borrowed these from a giantUgly - I wasn't trying to win any fashion contests, I mean I just wanted them for racquetball, but every time I put these on someone makes fun of me, and I can't blame them. I now know how the dog wearing a cone feels.Padding is cheap. It's white and feels like thick double sided tape without the adhesive on one side.Bottom line: These work. For sure. I wear 'em, I just always get made fun of and wish they were made of higher quality components."
3,"Works fine, but doesn't hold up","The price for this brush is great and it provides a nice even application. However, mine started loosing texture, shape (and bristles) after about a year and I had to toss it. Definitely not as high quality as the Prescriptives brush I use for foundation. I've had good luck so far with a small Sonia Kashuk brush for eye shadow, so I think this line of brushes might be a good value for low intensity or less frequent use."
4,"It's good - and it's ""free""","I've read the first couple of chapters, and can only say: Paul DuBois (and his co-authors Stefan Hinz and Carsten Pedersen who, for some reason, aren't listed as authors on Amazon) have done it again: Written an excellent book on MySQL. I have yet to go and actually sit the exam, but I think that this book will have me well prepared by the time I go.I find it frustrating that there are no ""real"" sample questions -- almost all exercises are open-ended, but what you'll see on the exam are multiple-choice questions. That's why I'm not giving the book the 5 stars that the main text deserves.Oh, and the book is free -- that is, if you're certain you're going to go to the exam anyway. There's a discount voucher inside the book that'll be good for $50.00 (the list price of the book) off of an exam..."
1,No sample data !!,I'm giving this book just 1 star because there is no sample data available. I like MySQL and like the idea of open source but this is a stange inconsistancy. I doesn't make sense. Two thumbs down!!
4,Propper Olive BDU Pants,"I bought these to go with the Propper shirt. The only reservation I have is that they try to cover a four inch waist variation in each size. If you are on the low end of the scale like me, you have a lot of excess waist. I made pleats in mine and now they fit fine."
2,College Management assistance,"I felt that this book provided pretty general common knowledge information. It gave examples of people who's college experience had an impact on them, but did not increase my knowledge of making that match between applicants and colleges. This book did not satisfy my ""need to know"" about the college process."
3,Hard to read.,"I've tried, but I just can't get into this book. Most of the institutions are in the east and we live in the southwest! Anyway, I found this book to be dull and hard to read."
2,Would you seriously turn down Harvard for one of these schools?,"I'm looking for a book to get my nephew thinking about colleges to attend, but this certainly isn't the right one. I think it's a good idea for him to shoot for an Ivy or sister school and this book is far too negative about them. It seems misleading at best to imply that the Harvard class of 1958 is destitute, and to say that Ivy schools are running scams at the undergraduate level. It may outline a good safety plan or path for specific circumstances, but I think it's dishing out bad advice in regards to the benefits and real experience of the Ivies. Such a shame as it would have been a nice book had the author stuck to providing additional options for consideration while holding his Ivy bashing tounge a bit."
5,Great read for understanding liberal arts colleges,"This book put into perspective the thought process of ""Big University"" over ""Small College"". I am motivated to encourage my children to look into some of these colleges because of the support systems that are in place there verses larger universities. For the amount of money that is invested in our children's college education, I want to send my children to a school that is invested in their success as much as I am."
2,Misleading and hyped,"I went to an Ivy. Some of what the author says is true. Yes, many of the classes were large and some were taught by grad students. But, I totally disagree with the author's view that students do little work and get easy A's and don't really learn much. Courses were challenging and grades were certainly not inflated."
4,Colleges That Change Lives...book review,I have not finished the book but it promises to give some very informative information and was recommended to me by a college professor in NC. It just took a very long time to get to me.
4,If I knew then...,Wish I'd had this book before my Ph.D. spouse took a job at a college that is not on this list and never will be. These are the places she would have thrived and been welcome. This book is as much for faculty as it is for parents and prospective students. It is sad that there are only 40 schools on the list. This is the one list every institution of higher learning should aspire to be on.
3,No schools listed in the west,"Wish I had known that the book focused on schools on the east coast, in the midwest, and in the southeast. No California schools are listed."
2,Too wordy and confusing,"I was really excited to get this book and when it arrived I dug right in...within 20 minutes my eyes had glazed over. I found the book to get off point and it tended to be a tangent on alternative College's vs. just getting to the good stuff. Overall I felt it was to focused on bashing the Ivy League schools vs. just focusing on the positive attributes of these 40 Colleges.I think the idea is great, but some good editing could go a long way to improve this book."
1,sigh,"Aggressively unhelpful; meandering, rambling style with terrible jokes, terrible prose, and worst of all, a dearth of actual practice lessons. The majority of the book is taken up with third-rate 'scholarship' about the history of piano-related instruments, or with minutiae about electronic keyboards. Avoid at all costs."
1,This book is horrible,"I don't particularly care for the Idiots and Dummies boks because the title alone speaks down to you, but this book is the crown jewel of bad.Every paragraph, and I do mean every pragraph contains some lame joke, for what reason? I don't know.And I could only find a few places where he actually told you which finger to put on which key. Isn't that the point of a book on how to play the piano?Take my advice, don't waste your money on this book."
1,Not a good choice,"I would not suggest buying this prouct. It cracked the first time I used it. I was hitting wiffle balls with it, and after about 10 minutes it was cracked down the side. Before I bought the bat, I read a review from a previous customer that said it was going to crack, but I didn't believe it. He was right! His cracked right away, and so did mine."
1,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time. This bat cracked and broke the 1st time it was used. I wasted my $$.
5,Wonderful product. smooth and creamy taste,I love this coffee. I bought in on vacation in Chicago and haven't been able to find it anywhere. Until now..
5,wonderful writer,"Read Nanci Kincaid and you are in for a real treat. She grabs you with her talent, creates wonderful characters. Her books are alive and when you finish them you look for more."
2,Their Earlier Albums Were Much Better,"This is a band which hooked me with the album ""Crappin You Negative"". (...) that is such a good album. I proceeded to buy everything else I could find from them. Each purchase was more diappointing than the previous, this one being the worst. <P(...)Also, ""One Sock Missing"" is a good precurser to Crappin. ""Full Blown Possesion"", however, is not worth the price."
2,All the songs sounded the same,"The first song I sampled was real good, so I listened more; couldn't tell the difference between the first or the second or third..."
4,pretty good,"This record is alright. I skipped some of the tracks, while others I played over and over until i could stand them no more and then played them one more time. Some of the highlights are Spank Through, The Rose and a few others I can't remember while the absolute best songs on the album are Green river's Hangin Tree and the Fastbacks' cover of Green River's Swallow My Pride. It's a good album to have around if you're a fan of Sub Pop."
5,Celtic Woman Christmas,"This is a simple yet elegant cd by five of the worlds best singers. Each song has a touch of the Irish flavor. These are inspirational, beautiful, fun and unique rendentions of some our best loved standard Christmas songs and the Celtic Christmas song which I have never heard before are now among my favorites. I have been serenaded by Angles. I can just see Jesus smiling as these ladies sang to, for and about his daya of birth."
5,Celtic Christmas Review,"This is without a doubt, one of the most talented group of women singers, that I have ever heard or seen. Each is a superb singer on her own, and together it's like listening to the angels singing. I think the arranger/ leader of the orchestra David Downs is to be commended for his arrangements and the bringing together of this group of singers"
4,FLA Remixes & Rarities on 1 CD,"This 12 track collection of the rare, the B-Sides and the remixes include some great previously unheard of FLA sounds and melodies. I have fast became a FLA fan. I have personally felt any piece of work or artistry by Leeb and Fulber or Peterson and Leeb is 99% a smashing hit. Whatever your tastes, whether you enjoy early FLA or the more recent releases, in this CD every listener will find a song or songs that they shall enjoy. There are 4 remixes which are some of the best remixes I have heard enterprising and collectively suave to listen and move your body too. The 'Colombian Necktie' Edit (track 6) is probably the best ever Remix of this song I have heard so far. The early and later sounds of FLA mix well together and one can pretty much hear the changes in styles and delivery.This is for the hardcore FLA fans. And for all those FLA fans who are picking up every album one by one."
4,All 90's singles on one disc thats perfect for me!,The reason that it's perfect for me is be cause i don't own any of the singles.... but now i got all of the singles be cause of Explosin!!! the first time i listen to it i thought it's ok... but a few more times i was Addicted! the song 'Plasticity' by itself was worth picking up the album alone the ather songs was just a big bonus.You must buy this CD if you are a FLA fan.
3,I don't see the target?,"Sure, this is a great disc, but honestly... Who is buying it? The diehard FLA fans (like myself) gets upset because it lacks one or two B-sides from every single and gets them instead.The average FLA fan just won't bother as, even if it has some tops also has a lot of lows."
4,Entertaining to the Utmost!,"This was an entertaining and fun book. Recomended by my father, I knew it had to be good. It was a very plesant way to spend my free time. Much better than the other Francis books I have read in the past. Recomended to the casual mystery reader."
3,"Alexander is a hero, but the story lacks strenght","The best feature of this book is the outstanding development of Alex Kinloch character whose actions, thoughts, personality, reflections and humor made me go along with him all the way to the end. The story however has nothing to do with the quality of the character"
2,This just doesn't have Francis' usual zip,"I usually find myself finishing a Dick Francis novel in one sitting, but found myself plodding through this one. It starts well enough with a great opening paragraph and a good hook early on with a brutal beating for an unknown reason. But then it slows down with family squabbles, legality, and business concerns. The introduction of a rather oddball but highly competent private detective adds a little spark, but lacks interest until the final chapters, If you're a fan of the author, as I am, you will read this, but if you haven't read any previous Francis books, I recommend starting with one of his earlier ones."
5,Down from the Mountain,"One of our favorite Dick Francis, TO THE HILT has both suspense and the British humor, which is sly and cunning. Alexander Kinlock is the odd ball of his family. But his uncle, the Earl, understands the reclusive personality of an artist who earns a decent living with renderings of the game of golf.Summoned from his lair by his step-father, he is confronted by death, the necessity of hiding a horse and saving the brewery, which is the main stay of the family business. Hiding family treasures is Alex's forte along with his visionary paintings.If you haven't read this one, find it and do, it is mystery, chaos and family at its best.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,"Another spine-tingling, Francis mystery extraordinaire","This one is yet another terrific Dick Francis mystery. I'm a huge fan of these novels, and ""To the Hilt"" was every bit as juicy, intriguing, complex, wry, etc. as all the others. But I think the time is ripe for a female protagonist in Francis' stories."
3,"Excellent character development, OK story","This was my first Dick Francis and will definitely will not be the last. I did enjoy the development of all characters, the main one; Alexander, in particular. This is what got me going to the end of the book.Without revealing anything of the plot I would say that the story; however, lacks and drags at certain points. Also, some of the actions of the main characters do not make much sense and it is obvious that they are stretched to give the whole story some sort of body and a few cliffhangers to keep the reader at it.In summary, a cozy, fast and unassuming mystery that will keep you interested for a couple of days if you oversee the obvious licenses the author took with his story."
4,A delightful mystery,"Although I've read a few of his mysteries, Francis's books have never really captured me. To the Hilt has made me re-think my opinion. Alexander Kinloch, artist and black sheep is called by his step-father to help save the family business, a well-known brewery. Involving an angry step-sister, embezzlement, a wife in name only, and a slightly out-of-kilter uncle who happens to be Lord of the Manor with a very valuable heirloom; this mystery keeps things percolating and challenges the intellect. This one's a lot of fun and I wish I could have seen Alexander dragged into another mystery."
4,A random walk down obscure financial fiction,"I really enjoyed this book. It's intelligent, has just enough truth in it to be confused as real (like Coupland's Microserfs), funny, insider and both moves quickly and is a short, quick read. If your into the investment, hedge fund or quant world and would like a fun story, this book is for you. Reminded me many times of a normal day on Wall Street when things are going well and it gets quirky."
1,Cook book,I did not care for most of the recipes in this cookbook. I am from the south and was looking for good southern vegan meal options and this book did not provide that for me.
3,ayh its ok,"I was really excited to get this cookbook, but i haven't made a single thing from it. Its well written, but not that inspiring."
5,Awesome!,"Bought this book for my dad's birthday and he absolutely loves it. He's been reading about all the artists that were popular when he was younger. He's resisted buying a CD player for years, but now he's gonna get one so he can reconstruct his record collection with CDs. A great book from cover to cover."
2,A Hodge Podge collection at best,"While I enjoyed renewing my memory of several of the albums and artists listed here, the criteria for inclusion is insanely schizophrenic. How do Ellington, Goodman, Prima and Woody Herman all make the grade while Count Basie does not? Morrissey over Van Morrison? Al Jarreau over Mark Murphey? ABBA and the Carpenters but no Turtles?Stil, if this volume points anyone in the direction of Julie London it can't be a bad thing."
2,An Uninteresting Reference Source,"While many like myself will have a definite need for a book of this genre, I found it most dissapointing. It is badly researched and wildly inaccurate, and therefore self-defeating. There is more Fantasy than fact which is not a good thing for a reference source."
3,Good for Beginners,"As an acknowledged novice in the whole Lounge/Easy Listening Jazz genre, I found this to be a very handy reference tool. It's well organized and the writing is light and informative.However, I am a little dismayed at the author's definition of Lounge. Why is it that Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, and Dizzy Gillespie are lounge, and yet Sonny Rollins, Lester Young, and Jimmy Smith are not? For example, Lester Young influenced Stan Getz and yet, the former is not included in this volume. And Charlie Parker, who is a little difficult musically, is also in this book? I don't get it."
3,Good starter book,"(Sorry, no comments about the Four Freshmen.)This is a helpful book for the novice interested in Lounge stylings, but don't count on it for a comprehensive (or fully accurate) detailed account of any particular artist.Mr. Knopper covers a wide range of artists, but misses some key artists when it comes to niches such as polka and acappella jazz. Also, basic facts included in several musicians' biographies are just plain incorrect.Still, this is a blast to peruse, and you may find yourself caught up for hours using the great cross-reference charts. The beginner will learn a lot. And the music aficionado will enjoy having all these artists referenced together in one volume."
2,disappointing,"as a novice to exotica, easylistening/martini buff, i looked forward to seeing this book. i came across it at a bookstore and was very disappointed in its descriptions of some well known music. how could someone ""knowledgeable"" disregard all the amazing things that people like 'dick hyman and the lowery organ' to mere mention as just jazzy. i wanted to by a book to tell me stuff. it appeared very pedestrian in its approach to 'cool'. and thats a no-no in cool swinging music and lifestyle."
5,"""Fountain of Inner Joy "" is practical and Inspiring","Hear is an inspiring book that is universal in outlook, with no bias. Dr. Khanna focuses at the heart and soul of the person and provides uplifting, practical and inspiring actions to change your outlook and relationships."
5,AWESOME,"if you know C and/or read c++ for dummies BUY THIS BOOK, this book explains streams very well as well as overloading operators ect. and in the end you go through the procces of building a REAL app. it also covers making your own streams"
1,SELLING OUT TO DATE PRODUCTS!!,dont do business with this seller. if you have any problems they will not contact you to resolve any issues. also they sold me an out to date tuner and that is why they wont get back with me to refund me my money. dont do business with them. that is very unprofessional!!
1,Kenwood teaching you a lesson here,"I bought the kenwood top of the line 7"" double din... I've been looking for the digital box for a while now... Don't ever support a company who don't stand by their product, ever!!! let it die. I will never buy a kenwood product again."
4,Pretty good,"I want to concurr in every way with the previous reviewer. The Elgar, which I'd never heard before, was a revelation and I'd say it's almost as good as the three Brahms sonatas. Midori and her accompanist play it very well. The Franck is less successful. Midori, who's intonation is beyond belief -- technically, she is astounding -- is less expressive and emotional than in the Elgar. McDonald is excellent throughout.To take a step back, Midori, who has taken some hits for being an unmusical child virtuoso, is clearly attempting to establish herself as a more serious musician in some unshowy repertory. She's on her way and we should thank her for selecting the Elgar."
1,Roland makes a LP,"If you haven't enough money to buy a Roland Sampler, buy a music magazine, it contains a cd with samples of roland's electronic instruments, but dont lisen this cd..."
1,Pos potser si.....,Be la veritat es que som uns pencos musicals pero com que vaig sortir per la tele fent l'imbecil ara m'aprofito de la meva popularitat televisiva i puc editar un disc patetic i sortir per la tele... Tots aquells que s'ho curren el doble amb aparells electronics i tenen anys de conservatori a les espatlles son uns pringats..... nosltres savem vendre!
1,Bad illustrations,"The original book was made form Washi (Japanese paper) which was the only saving grace. Written during the American occupation, this book sings the praises of kimono as all the JTB books do - however, in context it was at a time when people could hardly afford kimono... and when they were being sold to the Occupying forces as souvenirs in order to buy food.The illustrations are quite badly done, and it is one of the least informative books I have seen on kimono. I am shocked to see it reprinted."
4,Wee Sing Christmas,"My son loves this Wee Sing product. He's not totally into it like other Wee Sing movies, but as he is beginning to become a little bit more familiar with Christmas and all that comes with it, I can see that he appreciates it."
2,Best Christmas ever,"My grandchildren did not like this movie as much as the other Wee Sing Movies. It did not hold the attention of the 2, 3, 5, or 7 year old like Together, Train, or Sillyville did. Not as cute of a movie as the others."
2,"NOT the ""Best Christmas Ever""","Unfortunately, this video cannot compare to the quality of 'Grandpa's Magical Toys' or 'Old King Cole', adored by my 16-month-old grandson. This was boring and did not hold his attention for long - mine either."
1,Really annoying,"This movie features adults dressed as elves, dancing around and singing in fake elf voices. Then the scene switches to a family putting up a Christmas tree. It's hard to decide which family member is the worst actor, possibly Dad. The family then entertains us with still more bad singing in fake jolly voices.As another reviewer mentioned the diversity came off as so calculated, one black child, one Asian child, one child in a wheelchair, etc. You could just see the casting director with a check list when choosing actors. The whole production comes off as uninspired and white bread.I usually like sentimental Christmas projects, even kind of hokey sentimental Christmas stories, but this one was just bad.I don't see this appealing to the High School Musical, Hannah Montana crowd."
5,Wow... just an amazing movie .....,"This is such a classic christmas movie .... I watch it every year with my family around Christmas time. Me and my friend Brian love this movie because of how funny and how much holiday spirit it has....... Brian remeber the first time we watched this in my basement with my brother ..... hahah great times .... ""NICE RECOREDER CHRIS"" .... ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!!!!!!"
4,Bought this while I served as principal for elementary school,"Bought this while I served as principal of an elementary school, I do not remember specifices of this book, I've retired"
2,The New Meaning of Educational Change,"Although this book does present the history of educational change the author is overly wordy. Instead of simply stating his concepts and ideas, he talks in circles and makes it very difficult to grasp what he is trying to communicate. I find this book a poor choice as a text book."
4,Educational Reform,"I had to read this book for a class, but I have to say it was interesting. It has a lot of good information in the different chapters."
3,"You, too, can learn Calculus!","This was my second attempt to learn Calculus - I failed so miserably the first time, I stopped trying and waited 12 years. This book is complex, but combined with lecture, it is learnable. As with all textbooks, when it comes to the exercises vs. the examples, you're left wondering how they could come up with that!? So, I had to supplement this text with the Pre-calc and Calc Schaum's Outlines (totally separate learning material) - basically for more detailed/solved problems. It was not available when I bought this text, but I would certainly buy the student solutions manual with it...the university I attend follows this book from Calc 1 to Calc 3, so it's really nice in the respect that I don't have to buy another book."
1,Miserable Examples,"I am taking calculus in college and when I sit down to do the problems assigned for homework I have an enormous amount of difficulty following the steos that the books uses for their examples. The book always uses perfect examples, things like the indefinete integral of 3x^2 and provides far more difficult problems in their homework sections. Although this seems trivial it becomes a much more substantial problem when it comes to 'u' substition and the problems that can arise from during it and the practice needed to master such things. Talking to my fellow classmates this is a very common complaint that the examples that the books give are far too simple. If it were not for a calculus professor or fellow classmates who have taken the class who can help me I would not be able to understand calculus."
1,Terrible garment,"Purchased 1 size up and was still too tight in area's and loose in others. I'm 5'10 and 178lbs and not overly muscular and have decent midsection. It reminds me of wearing a ballistic vest , as it limits range of motion and feels like cardboard, although is not scratchy."
1,Bad choice,"It,s the right size in arm,s and shoulder,s. But baggy and short every where else.Not pleased at aaaaaaaaaall."
4,Crystalline Mozart on Period Instruments,"I really appreciate the addition of the mostly unknown, non catalogued symphonies. Mariner and the Academy have done a top notch job on capturing the crystalline quality of Mozart. For me, Mariner captures the spiritual quality of Mozart better than Pinnock. The late symphonies collection (21 - 41) is also very good, but I still prefer the Joseph Krips collection (subjective personal choice, not necessarily better). I bought a used set for under $15.00, what a bargain! I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves Mozart."
4,"Great music, great perform","Well, the Mozart Collection is quite expensive Near $2,000.00. But i think it worth the effort. If you are trying to begin a mozart collection, then you should buy this first piece. The music is great, the performers: not the top, nor the bottom. In general, I recomend it."
5,Book,This is in my judgement the best book of the south Asian campaign. Well researched. I would buy other books by this author.
4,Great Book !,wonder insiteful instruction and help for persons new to using these materials. Interfacing and stabilizing is covered pretty well.
2,poor viewing quality,"This VHS, was faded and blury, the pictures were not crisp and sharp, i liked the content, but was disapointed in picture quality"
5,High quality...great price!,"I'm on my 6th box of these nails using my Senco Framepro 601, and have yet to experience a jam. The price here at Amazon is about $10 a box cheaper than HD or Lowes. Grip-Rite is all about fasteners, and these clipped head nails from them won't let you down!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,They told me these were just as good as the expensive nails. Well boy weren't they wrong! These nails will not shoot through any air nailer. I had to get a box of more expensive nails to shoot through a gun.
4,Good quality for the price,"Okay, so the description and reviews did not specify if this was a made out of wood or plastic, after carefully reading the reviews and making an executive decision of purchasing it, (since I never saw or knew what a Wiffle Bat was). Never the less, I did ordered it and I just received the bat and it is not wood, it is plastic, but is really steady and hard to ""swing away"". I will be using it for a pinata, but most definitely, I will sure use for other things including teaching my daughter how to aim and hit the balls. Very satisfied with the purchase."
4,ordinary bat,"you can get it cheaper at local stores such as 99c or deals etc. but it came on time, thanks"
2,cdad,"I recently bought this bat and was a bit disappointed in the diameter of the bat which is about 1.5"" wide at the thickest point. I must admit I played baseball and do not recall the wiffle ball stage of life, but I was expecting something a bit wider in diameter along the lines of a baseball bat which is closer in width to the 3"" diameter baseball and 9"" wiffle balls which I ordered with it.The 9"" wiffle ball is only 3"" in diameter--why they call it a 9"" ball is something I did not get either. The previous bat and ball I was using with my 3 yr old boy and six year old girl were wider closer to 4"" diameter for both, which so far I feel works better at that age. Perhaps with time I will feel differently, but if you are not that wiffle ball knowledgeable, this review might help you understand what you are buying a bit better. I not sure if these are typical dimensions for a wiffle ball and bat or, if there is even a standard?"
5,son loved this!!,My son ordered this and loved it! He is really into playing wiffle ball with his friends. He is 10 years old.
4,Don't miss it.,"If you're reading this, you're thinking about buying this album. Which means somehow you've heard OF Whistler.. (or Ian Dench or EMF, but whatever).The melodies on this cd are amazing. The female voice is soft and harmonic. Just go ahead and buy it.You won't regret it. And while you're at it, pick up their second cd, Faith in the Morning as well. You won't hear anything like this again."
5,"What a relief-Finally, a mountain of useful information...","I had to come back to Amazon and write this review. I purchased Frank Coleman's book over 3 month's ago while I was preparing for a trip to Ukraine. The book saved my tail. I was hanging out in the different forums for a while and all I was getting was advice from people that were more lost than I. I just came from the best trip of my life, met 3 of the most beautiful girls and now I am planning a return trip. If I had not read this book while preparing for the trip, I honestly think the trip would have been a disaster. I think that every single man should go to Ukraine or Russia. If they read this book, they will find out what the best kept secret really is and it is not here in the USA. The trip was the most eye opening experience I have had in my life. You hear often how beautiful, elegant and educated the FSU women are but words really cannot describe it. Just go there and you will be glad you did."
1,"Not helpful, amateurish...","This book is a joke. One can get far more accurate and practical information for free from several mailing lists and web sites dedicated to finding, courting, and (hopefully) marrying a woman from the FSU. Turns out that this is more of a sketchy and disjointed (this guy is obviously not a writer) travelogue of resturants, casinos and nightclubs, conquests (ick), and the occasional rant about how great Russian women are compared to American women. This book doesn't even make it as a document of one man's personal quest; by the end of the book, the reader doesn't even know whether the author decided to persue marriage with anyone at all. Stick with the free newsgroups and save your money."
1,Power Rangers Goldars Vice Versa,This movie is boring.Its about a fire safety club thats going on at Angel Grove which Aisha is captain of and she's been taking her job a little to far.Then Lord Zedd creates a monster which she wants to defeat by herself.Good thing the rangers talk some since into her before she really loses it.But overall this video is one of the worst in all mmpr movies that were made.I always wondered why they made most mmpr movies instead of zeo.When they were zeo they rocked but only 2 videos were ever made. I wish they could have made more zeo vhs like that episode where Tommy became king for a day or where the gold/black ranger lost his powers but thats too bad!Anyway I wouldn't buy this video and hopefully this review helped.
3,"good build, not sure about durability","I bought this sprayer because it sounded like it was built really well, but when it arrived the tank had a dent in it. I was impressed by how solid it felt (especially the other components), but I decided to return it since it appeared as though it was easy to dent the walls of the tank. My sprayers will get banged around a bit.For the same money I bought 2 three gallon sprayers at the local Lesco store (they sell a Gilmore sprayer that they put their name on). These sprayers feel flimsy in comparison to the Chapin, but have the same features plus viton seals, very durable plastic tanks that are virtually dent proof, and a separate carrying handle so I don't have to use the pump handle to lift it. With 2 sprayers, I can put my foliar feeding solution in one and a fungicide in the other and not have to empty them out to change solutions like I would have had to do with only one Chapin sprayer."
3,Pretty design...,"I had ordered these earrings as they are I believe on a bit of a discount now. The design is quite pretty, and the pattern is very pretty. But the silverwork was not up to my expectations. The outter ring was slightly misshapen, and there were significant flaws near were flaws on the top portion of the inner ring near where they would have been attached. I know I am being picky, but I also paid good money. I know these aren't that expensive, but excellent quality silver earrings can be had for this amount of money. Maybe my pair was just especially low quality... but I think much better can be had for the price."
3,"Good garage rock (or grunge, punk, alt, whatever!)(!)","No wonder glam metal fell and this stuff took over, glam-metal is rich boys music. In a way, this is how rock music should be played, rough, raw, working class. Don't hold your breath hoping for meticulous songcraft, but there are some great, catchy, energetic rockers here, no matter how chaotic it can be.But it's hard to like these guys, they're anti-authority, anti-authority and more anit-authority until you get sick of 'em sticking their finger up on every track telling everyone to get stuffed. There doesn't seem to be anything else to their personality. But anyway, it's really all in the name of good fun. Or entertainment. Or is it? Rating ***"
1,waste of money,It did nothing. Suggested by Dr. Oz. That was a bad call. Small company. The product didn't look very professional.
1,Hummingbird Smartcast RF40_B B-channel does not work with the RF15,"Recently bought a Hummingbird Smartcast RF15 (comes with one Channel A remote sonar).In addition I have deliberately purchased a Channel B RF40-B remote sonar.The channel A remote sonar works perfectly.The channel B remote sonar does not work - yes, I do change the channel reception to B on the RF15, but still - no signal"
3,A good first book,Sandra wrote an autobiography when she was 30 something and laid it all on the line. I enjoyed reading her story and passed the book around to gal friends. They were a bit shocked at her revelations but all agreed it was a fun book. It's not for the prudish so be aware that she gets into some devilish sexual situatons. All I can say is I wish I had known her when!
3,Should have bought the CD's...,"The other reviewer Raul said it perfectly. This DVD set is a figurative slap in the face for such a high-caliber, historic concert tour. I had the chance to see them in their stop in Los Angeles, and was blown away by the show, so I've been anxiously counting the days til' its release.Finally getting my hands on it, I excitedly pop in the disc into my High Definition TV and DVD system, only to have my jaw drop as I stare at the grainy film quality and weird aspect ratio of the concert on my screen.What was EMI thinking? Is this the kind of sad record they wanted fans to keep of these amazing shows? This should have been treated at the very least with a proper aspect ratio and sharp video production, if not full HD.The only thing saving this? The amazing music of course. But if all I was getting was good audio I would have bought the CDs.Heed the warning. Go for those instead."
4,producto,"El disco estaba muy bien. Pero esperaba que venga con fotografias o algo asi y no solo los discos.Segun las publicaciones en el sitio oficial, venía con fotografias del evento.En todo caso. Gracias"
3,Horrible sound quality,"The songs are great but the sound quality is terrible. The volume is so low, you can't put any of the songs on a compilation disc without ruining the volume level of your other music."
5,Very Impressed by Floraline,"Floraline has clearly demonstrated a grasp of what POP is all about. Their music is fun, danceable, and picks-up on all the best sounds of Disco, New Wave and Techno. Don't let the Indy label fool ya. The Cardigans started with Minty Fresh. My bet is that Floraline will definately succeed. I'm already looking forward to their next CD."
5,"Living in Oregon, a great Latino Writer",Living in Oregon is a great Latino writer whose dreams are America. Amazing grace! Absolutely perfect from opening word to closing sentence.
3,Not one of her best stories.,"The book was OK, just not one of her best stories. I love the author. It was the last book of hers to find. I now have everything she has written."
5,spectacular British comedy!,"This is the most brilliantly-written comedy series ever. From the very first episode to the last, all the characters are consistent and hilarious. The plots are clever and each builds on previous episodes. Not a single word is wasted; each is carefully chosen to add something to the story.I won't give away the story lines, so I'll just tell you it is set in France during WWII. The main character is Rene, played by Gordon Kaye, who owns a cafe, and occupies his days trying to balance getting along with the Germans, the French Resistence, the Communist Resistence, his wife, who thinks she can sing, his mother-in-law, British airmen, various onion-sellers, the Gestapo, and the two lovely waitresses with whom he is having affairs.In some ways it's like the British series, ""Are You Being Served."" If you have ever enjoyed a single episode, you'll want to see all of them. You'll want to watch them again and again, and share them with friends."
4,Bon Bon,"What a hoot the 'Allo 'Allo series has been to see on this DVD series. Not sophisticated comedy, for sure, but if you enjoy a movie that pokes fun at a genre (in this case, historical movies or shows about the resistance or underground during WWII) and if you like British comedy ala Fawlty Towers...this is for you! Amusez-vous!"
1,"Money, money, money","Not impressed, tho I must admit she is more fun to read than Queen Orman. If you possess 30 cents worth of commonsense then this book says nothing new; not even in a new and exciting way.You are much better off to find a book entitled:Money Is My Friend"
3,"A good album, but the weakest album in Draconia's discography","This is a pretty good album, but when compared to Draconian's other albums, it falls a bit flat. Anders' harsh vocals are great, as are Lisa's clean vocals. None of the songs are particularly bad, there just aren't many standouts. ""She Dies"" is my favorite song on the album, and one of my favorite Draconian songs from any of their albums."
3,"OK, but you have to be a die hard fan to love this one","No question the Rev can play some great music, but Smoke 'Em If You Got 'em is uneven at best. Smoking tunes are mixed with stuff that probably shouldn't have made it onto the disk, and the Rev's lyrics sometimes cross the line from darkly humorous to simply moronic. If you're a die-hard fan, you've probably already stopped reading, but if you're looking for the best Horton Heat has to offer, this isn't it."
2,"Not Bad, Not Good","I have a great amount of Jim Heath's CD's aka The Reverend and although this is an early outing of the groups output it's erratic at best. Lots of great stuff, but alot of filler too. The BEST was to come later. For the price, it's acceptable at best."
