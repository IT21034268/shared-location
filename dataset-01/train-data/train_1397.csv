3,Good quality,The quality is good but the color was not what I expected. The sky blue sheets have a purple/pinkish tone to them.
2,disappointed,Product appeared nicely but was not as soft as i expected. I think this product will have some problems after washing several times. Would not recommend this product.
1,For the love of god... don't do it!,"I am so easy to please, it wouldn't have taken much to thrill me, but these sheets are terrible and instantly pilled up the first time I washed them. We are buying a new house and saving pennies, so I am not replacing them yet, but every night feel each and every pill in the fabric.Walmart would be an improvement. I would have been happy with anything, but these are ridiculous! The seams were fraying after the first wash in cold water as recommended.I'm too lazy to normally write reviews, but felt it was my civic duty to all people who sleep. Don't do it!"
2,"400 count egyptian cotton sateen queen sheets, white","The sheets arrived on time..I washed them before using them..I could barely fit the fitted sheets on my mattress..I needed heop to pull the sheets on the corners..The sheets read that they can go on 18"" mattress but I think its more like a 16"".I really needed help.to get them on. Also after a few washings the fabric began to get rough and pill. I now must flip the sheet wrong side up..I would not order these sheets.."
2,Quality Doesn't last,Sadly these lovely sheets are already showing threads after just 2 washes (in delicate cycle) A good purchase at the time but sadly not a quality keeper.
1,"A disappointment of so called ""Egyptian Cotton"" from Elegance","Purchased a set of the 400-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Ivory color before the end of 2005 at the price of $39.99 here at Amazon. The package arrived on schedule. However, the quality of the materials ""Egyptian Cotton"" is far less satisfactory. Compared this set to a few sets of my other Egyptian Cotton sheets, Elegance's sheet set is rougher and stiffer even after two full-cycle washes. I'd say stay away from this item if you are looking for quality Egyptian Cotton sheet sets."
3,nice but not great,"I bought this sheet set in Mint green, the color was pretty but have had softer 400 count sheets before. I guess I was happy with the price but wouldn't order them again."
3,Get out your iron & watch the color,"I just finished washing and drying the Queen sized WHITE set AS DIRECTED on the label.I should have remembered how wrinkled 100% cotton is even when washed in cold water and dried on warm.The label should say IRONING IS REQUIRED. Don't believe the ""touch up"" requirement the directions claim. Of course you could, if you don't care, sleep with prune textured sheets and pillow cases.The WHITE is far from WHITE but more like a FAINT YELLOW.I guess I should have stuck with the equivalently priced sale sheets at Penney's."
4,BEAUTIFUL SHEET SET,"This is a great sheet set. Nice cotton. The only thing I would advise is taking them out of the dryer while they are alittle damp and putting them on the bed. They don't wrinkle as bad that way and don't have to iron them. They are a very nice cotton, not lightweight, but just right. I've enjoyed them very much. Would recommend!!"
5,THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHEETS EVER!,"I SIMPLY LOVE THESE SHEETS. THE TEXTURE IS SOFT,SMOOTH AND ELEGANT. THEY FIT MY VERY PLUSH QUEEN SIZE MATTRESS PERFECTLY. I HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED THREE SETS AND PLAN TO PURCHASE MORE. ALSO, THE PRICE WAS RIGHT!SHERRIE ROBINSON, HOUSTON, TX,USA"
2,"Took too long to ship, then got wrong color!","This is a disapointment for me. I ordered these sheets in white, and recieved ivory. (unlike other reviewers I am not talking about a tinge of ivory, my package said IVORY instead of WHITE.) I would return these sheets, but they are a gift for my mother, and since they took so long to ship, I won't have time to get her anything else! I have never had a bad experience with Amazon products, some of the third party sellers could be better, but usually Amazon it's self is pretty good. Not in this case! The sheets do feel nice, and hopefully they work out for my mother, but I am keeping my paperwork and packaging just incase she runs into any problems!Buyer Beware: $200 dollar sheets for $30 is TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE."
2,"Extemely wrinkly, Elastic breaks on First Fitting",I washed the sheets before fitting them onto the bed for the first time and the elastic BROKE while putting on the fitted sheet!! I don't know if this is why they are clearing them out or not.Also the wrinkles are far worse than I imagined from the other warnings here but you'll just have to iron the pillowcases because they're pretty poor looking coming out of the dryer.
2,Sheets with a broken elastic band,"Hello,I recently ordered sheets: Elegance 400-Thread-Count Egyptian Sateen King Sheet Set, Sky Blue (Purchased on 09/19/2005) and paid 47.00 dollars including the shipping. A friend brought them to me since I live overseas. Unfortunately the first time I put them on my bed, the elastic band broke. As I mentioned, I live overseas so it is impossible for me to ship them back and get a full refund without spending a lot of money on the shipping. This is a bit disappointing and the last time I will purchase something like this.On a positive note, the fabric was nice and they were delivered when promised."
1,"Nubby, Nubby, Nubby--DO NOT BUY",I am VERY disappointed with these sheets. I have never had 400 thread count sheets wear so badly! I have a front load washer which is more gentle with laundry than a top loader and still--nubs!! They are about to hit the trash and I have had them just over a month! D
5,Dreamy,"I am very satisfied with the sheet set. It is so soft and fits perfect! Also the shipping was going faster then I expected!!Great Price, Great Product, Great Service :-)"
3,"So much potential, but...","I was so excited to see a new release w/ these names involved in it - especially when I learned that every track was produced by THE BEATNUTS. Unfortunately, like many albums today - this one's hit and miss. There are some incredible tracks (""Boy,"" ""Milf,"" and ""Runnin' Around"" to name a few), but there are a handful of tracks that I immediately fast forwarded through. Also, since BIG PSYCH and AL TARIQ are involved, where's the JU JU feature? It's incomplete and inconsistant, but there's still dope material on this disc."
1,Hokey and cliched.,"I bought this book to accompany me on a long trip, and wished I hadn't. The stories are very similar to each other, with platitudes of the 'my eyes met with the old woman in the rice paddy, and something wordless was exchanged' variety. I know there are better examples out there: why couldn't the editor find them?"
3,"Entertaining, fresh for new readers","This book is about a multiplicity of women telling different kinds of stories. Some of them are easy to identify with, some might not be, but overall, entertaining and fun read while traveling, or on weekends. Anecdotal."
5,Step out of your comfort zone,Ride a horse through China. Trek in Nepal. Ride on the back of a motorcycle from California to Northeast Canada. These women are adventurous... yet are normal women with real fears. After reading this book you'll have the courage to be more independent and challenge-seeking. The stories range from the thrill-seekers (think African safari) to conservative travellers (such as going to Gatlinburg for a weekend with the girls)...but illustrates that stepping out of your comfort zone means different things to different women. It's the effort that counts.
5,Good Cleansing Agent,"I've tried perhaps half a dozen different ""facial"" cleansers as opposed to just using my Dove handbar, and usually end up never buying a second bottle.This one was different. I like the cleaner very much. I just ordered another batch of three bottles (I like to stock up when I like a product).It leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. There is a minor grit mixed in with the thin lotion like formula. I feel like it helped reduce in-grown hairs along my neck and the minor whiteheads I get around my face."
4,First use,"I have really crappy skin ..lots acne scars, blackheads, whiteheads, discoloration, and huge pores. I've used proactiv for a year too. But I just tried this thing for the first time and already my skin looks and feels a little bit smoother and even! yay!! i really didn't expect it too work : ]"
5,Neutrogena pore cleanser,"I have one word: WOW! I used this the second I bought it and I couldn't believe the results I got. My pores were most certainly less visible, my skin looked brighter and more even, and it felt very smooth and clean to the touch. I am thoroughly impressed. Well worth the money! I very highly recommend this product."
3,"Pricey, but you will notice a difference","This stuff is a little more pricey than I'd like for a face wash but consistent use will reduce the size of your pores. It STINGS like all get out if you get it in your eyes though so wash your face carefully, and with your eyes completely closed."
1,Keep your receipt,"As a young adult, I have acne-prone skin with some enlarged pores around around my nose. I bought this hoping it would help clear me up, when, in fact, it did quite the opposite. When I first squeezed some into my hand I noticed that it had a very chemically odor. After I used it and rinsed my face, as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them, so I rinsed, rinsed, rinsed some more until the burning stopped. My face felt clean, but smelled like chemicals, and in the morning I woke up with a few new zits. I wasn't sure the cleanser was causing the breakout, so I kept using it. I slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it. About a week after I did, I was back to normal. I gave this cleanser to my sister to try and she had very good results, but stopped using it because she was concerned about the chemical odor. I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced."
2,Disappointing,"Overall, I just did not like this cleanser. Here's why:1) When I use a facial cleanser, I expect my face to feel refreshed and to glow. With this cleanser, my face just felt the same and looked sort of blah.2) I don't care for the scent. It's somewhat soapy and sharp.3) I was disappointed in the exfoliating aspect - this feels more like a cream cleanser. The microbeads are indeed there, but they don't seem to do much. Maybe they do and I just can't see it.4) I haven't noticed a visible improvement in my skin. My pores are the same size and my skin does NOT look refined. Granted, I don't use it every day so maybe that's why. Or maybe it has to do with #3.I realize that successful results are partly dependent on daily use. But for me, a pleasant scent and positive, noticeable, immediate results help motivate me to use the product. This product, unfortunately, does not motivate me."
5,A factual and conceptual cornerstone of the Occupy movement,"Since this is the edition that I read and used in some of my college courses that I taught in the 1970's, I will comment on this, the first edition. Published forty-four years before Occupy Wall Street, this book described the 1% and their disproportionate power. Whether this edition or a later one, this book would provide a factual and conceptual cornerstone of the Occupy movement. It identifies--and leaves us to solve--a very serious problem that has only gotten worse since the first edition.--John L. Hodge, author"
2,so disappointing,"I bought this book on the recommendation of the other reviews and I was so disappointed. I found the subject matter very interesting but I thought that the author should have written a philosophical and spiritual book rather than try and put his ideas into a novel. The story line was trite, the characters and situations were incredible and the editing bad. The grammatical mistakes and name changes were irritating."
5,"A Very Interesting, Fun Story","This book was very hard to put down! Following Dr. Steven Mallory's journey to the surprising conclusion was a treat. Mr. Wray weaves a complex tale of science and mysticism into an enjoyable read without bogging his story down in arcane details. The characters very real and one can relate to them very easily. Their paths in the story seem to travel in different directions, yet are neatly (and effectively) interwoven at the end. Enjoy!"
5,Great camera!,"I've used Amazon to order various items before and was always satisfied with the result...quality at low prices.I ordered a Sony Dsc G1 on Sunday June 24th and it arrived Thursday, June 28th.I've taken about 50 photos under critical conditions, low light and using the automatic features of the camera.I'm amazed at how well it performs. Big LCD screen, the camera is a nice size for my big hands, just a little bigger then the regular Cybershots. The resolution in the screen is excellent.I was considering the DSC T-100 but it got such bad ratings that I went with this camera....sure glad I did!When I figure out some of the more technical features I'll post a more detailed review."
2,Keys are extremely difficult to remove.,"I was not able to use this lock, because each of the three keys which came with the lock are virtually impossible to remove once inserted. I tried spraying WD-40 into the lock, but this did not help. I will have to purchase another lock to replace this one.If the keys would come out it would have been fine. The lock fit in the desired mailbox, and the wide selection of ""cams"" allowed me to find one that worked."
4,Good intro to the next generation,"This book really continues on the story started in the Red River of the North series, but focuses on the next generation of Bjorklunds and a few new characters. It was a nice contrast to get away from the farm life towards the middle / end of the book and get a taste of city living in the late 1800's."
3,Hurry up with the next book!!!,"I'm not sure why this series is called ""RETURN to Red River,"" Thorliff doesn't LEAVE the Red River Valley until the last 10% of the book. The plot jumps back and forth between Thorliff's family/friends in Blessing, and a girl named Elizabeth in Minnesota who wants to be a doctor, despite her social-conscious stepmother's desires. She meets Thorliff at the end of the book when he gets a job with her father's newspaper.Info for fans of the other 6 books: there is one death of a long-time character, and 2 of Thorliff's friends get married and go west. The people introduced in ""Blessing in Disguise"" (book #6) are not mentioned at all, but based on the reviews, maybe they won't be missed much."
1,Be careful!,"I wanted to love this product! I followed the directions exactly, but yeowch!!! I used it ONCE on my eyelids and it burned them to a crisp! Its been 3 weeks and my eyelids are still swollen and bumpy. I still use them UNDER my eyes as directed but the results are minimal. The skin under my eyes feels a little smoother, but if I hadn't already shelled out the cash, I wouldn't bother to use them at all. I love all of the other Olay products, but this one falls waaaay short.P.S. Amazon has this listed at $27. At drugstores its around $20 - $21... save your money anyway."
5,"Great fun. Somebody really needed to write books like this, and I am glad he did...","Kudos to Mr. Garner. I have read all three books. I think the bedtime story book 1 and the Holiday story book are the best. I am employed in a large metro area, where we seem to be inundated with all this touchy-feely, politically correct stuff - I see it in memos and we have training to attend from time to time where we hear terms like those in the books. Garner does such an excellent job showing how ridiculous it can get and how ridiculous many of them are. Any time I need a good laugh I read one of his updated stories, and have a good ""belly laugh"". I absolutely love these books."
5,Best Book in the world,"This book is hands down the best book in the world.It is extremely intelligent and is the most interesting book to our imagination.Brilliant humor in every paragraph or sentence for that matter.There was no book like it..of course,now others are expanding on Mr.Garners idea.I have the shorter version but it was disappointing as it didnt have all of his humorous stories..this book,Once Upon a More Enlightend Time etc..is the book i take everywhere.I do not get tired of reading the funny terms..definately takes away the realities of reality and grumpy people who have no sense of decent humor.Lighten up,have fun with this book.Mr.G,your a GENIUS."
3,new book,"Did expect a new book, which I knew it wasn't as on the inside it had a thank you from a student to his teacher! As I was going to give the book as a present..........."
5,Just what I ordered,Shipment was fast. Product was exactly as described. Would definately order from this place again.
1,Not Funny,"I'm going to start off by saying that I'm a teenage girl and basically everything makes me laugh. My algebra class, for starters, can send me into fits of giggles that have made the teacher suspect I was high (I wasn't.) I love The Onion and Saturday Night Live and I thought this book would be similar. I read the whole thing and smiled a couple times but I never even chuckled. It's not funny. I understand how he's trying to be funny by being over the top politically correct but it doesn't do it for me. ""Wommon"" ok, now while I have friends who use that word seriously, it's not funny after the 17th gazillion time. You're PC, congrats."
1,It was not humorous and should have never been a book.,"This book was horrible, I hated it. There is nothing more to say about it, it was just a horrible book that made fun of Christian religion."
5,The most humorous book I've ever read,"This book is a breath of fresh air for me. I've yet to complete it, but thus far it has provided innumerable laughs. I have, in fact, several persons waiting ""in line"" to read this after I am finished. These are the stories of our childhood, but with a modern twist, if you will. If you are an ultraconservative, though, this is not a piece you are likely to enjoy."
3,A twisted view of the '70s.,"Americathon was a satire about the 1970s showing what the country would be like if the trends continued. People don't remember now but every night the news broadcasts announced a new ""crisis"" When I moved out to college in 1976 I could afford rent and food on minimum wage; by the time I graduated I was living off sardines and crackers. President Carter blamed America for being under a ""great malaise"" and interest rates hit 20%. To a lot of people the future depicted in ""Americathon"" wasn't all that unbelievable."
4,A second Look,"With the recent Wall Street meltdown and increasing bailout from foreign investors, I think this movie deserves a second look. It's predictions from twenty years ago are becoming eerily accurate. I'm still laughing, just a little more nervously."
4,Americathon,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. I think it was very funny and can be enjoyed today. The company that owns the rights to this film should release it on DVD.
2,Do you have a tolerance for corniness?,"This movie has some cute moments esp. at the beginning where Eric McMurkin (Peter Riegert) wakes up and begins his day's ablutions in his compact little home - his car. Progressing on into the Americ-athon itself, things are entertainingly corny."
1,America-THUD,"Here's a great idea for a comedy that assembled a capable cast but lacked enough inspired ideas to make it work. Some scenes like Meatloaf battling a car sound funnier than they are. The film does begin promisingly. A wonderful Beach Boy song, a funny montage, and the humorous premise is laid out by our narrator, George Carlin.Then it gets tired and labored.Waste your time with a rental perhaps, but few will want to sit through this more than once.Christopher J. Jarmick author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F Holder -- Available February 2001"
3,Great Effort but falls short,"I am a priest and am very much in agreement with the author, but there are other books that do a much better job of dealing with the material. Although the author's work is very helpful and very practical, it is also a bit narrow. The work is an excellent - and i really mean excellent - study of three specific documents. And while it addresses the wider issue of the abuse of the Liturgy, it does so by pontification and not by actual research. The authors opinions are fairly accurate, but not authenticated. The work is a decent introduction to the very serious issue of liturgical abuse, but will fall very short under any serious scrutiny. I recommend it as one resource among many, but not as a first book or as an only book on the subject. See Pope Benedict (Ratzinger) or Alcuin Reed for more thorough studies of the matter."
5,Definitive Oracle work,"This is a huge book, and it's tough to consider it a ""nutshell"" (I'd hate to see the squirrel)---but it is far and away the most accurate and complete of all the Oracle mega-references out there. If you've tried to muddle through Oracle documentation, this is really a breath of fresh air."
2,Disappointing,"As an Oracle developer, I don't get much use out of this book. I rarely find an answer quickly."
2,Inconvenient and Uneducational,"This book was very disappointing. It contains very few examples of anything. While it is useful (though cumbersome) to determine the syntax of Oracle commands, it provides no examples of how to practically use the commands. It gives me no help in determining what command, function, or package to use, no help in how to use it, only the syntax or declaration of it. I find it far more useful to use one of my other reference books or go to the web; at least there I typically find advice and examples on how to use the commands. The book is of very limited use!."
5,Pileated Woodpecker,I bought this for a birthday present for a friend of the families child. She was totally pleased and excited was even more than expected.
3,stuffed woodpecker review,My 4yr.old grandson wanted a stuffed woodpecker with a hard beek. This was the best option I could find. And it sings. Thought it was worth the price and he was happy with it.
5,Fantastic album!,"Yyrkoon, hailing from France, has put together a masterpiece of a death metal album. Everything this album incorporates is piece of music most metal fans can dig.These guys know how to growl. They know harmony through impressive guitar solos. They know fast, and they know how to 'hook' many a listener. It it truly disappointing that we won't be hearing much more from Yyrkoon, as rumor has it the band has split up. Thier previous album, Dying Sun was more than a worthy debut, but everything Dying Sun accomplishes, Unhealthy Opera does better.Regarding the band's name, What does Yyrkoon actually mean? It doesn't sound French. Unhealthy Opera gets a fantastic 4.75/5 stars"
3,"Great movie, bad job, Criterion.",Movie is fantastic. Special feature selection was 'eh'. Insert material was next to non-existent. This was one of my most highly anticipated Criterions of the year and they kind of botched it.
2,Glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.,"I would rate this film only so-so. Lots of violence, which I guess some people like. But it doesn't make up for an uninteresting story."
4,Grifter's Delight!,"A voyeuristic, deceptive, nonlinear, plot twisting, neo-noir film in 70 minutes!What have you got to lose?Maybe you're sense of security..."
3,retro appeal,"Overall, an enjoyable movie. Those familiar with film noir will see elements from that genre. From the black and white format, to the femme fatale with a gangster boyfriend, it has the major features of that type. I tend to like movies focused on the storytelling, and not the special effects. This one achieves that, with a low budget appeal. The acting falls flat at times, but still worth a watch."
3,If you like Memento . . . see this too,"You can really see how this was the precursor to MEMENTO in that he uses the same device of telling the movie out of sequence and gives you the surprise ending. Otherwise it has a very low budget look shot in B&W; with English actors that are sometimes hard to understand, but its quick 70 minute length means that it never gets boring.The movie is about an unemployed writer that starts following people because he's bored. After tailing a thief for a while, the thief realizes that he's not a cop and decides to take the follower along on some break-ins. Told so out of sequence that you piece it together little by little, the follower follows and starts dating the girl whose house they broke into.The DVD had a decent commentary, and a feature that lets you see the whole thing in sequence. This is like watching a touted ballplayer in his rookie season, a lot of promise and rewards to come."
4,Very Memento...ish,"Ever thought you were being followed?We liked this one better than Memento, definitely keeps you thinking with lots of twists and turns. Entirely in B&W; but that was okay, it works well here. We recommend."
4,A simple mans Review,"I sat down in anticipation to see what else the writer of memento would throw at me. I was put off at first because it was black and white, but about 3 minutes into the movie I no longer cared. The movie was amazing, plenty of twists, lots of weird things going on, and much more easy to follow that memento, which was good considering I watched it at 3am. The things discussed in the movie (""shadowing"" and bordeling fetish breaking and entering) was origional, and much appreciated in a world seemingly filled with sub-standard, repetitive, regurgitated ideas. This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and recomend that any one purchase it."
4,Great Film !!!,"This is one of the best films I have seen by a first time Director. Excellent acting, story and editing. Even though the film isn't anything like Rodriquez's ""El Mariachi"", the raw talent of director Christopher Nolan is so evident. Where Rodriquez failed with ""Desperado"" his second outing, Nolan prevailed with an even more breathtaking escapade in ""Memento""(not to be missed). Christopher Nolan is a talent that will be around for a long time to come. Al Pacino is aready slated for his next film."
4,"Entertaining, thought-provoking film","The director of ""Memento"" does not disappoint with this movie. As in ""Memento,"" viewers are asked to piece together a chronologically scattered puzzle. The result is a well done, thought-provoking film that's worth watching, and watching again to share with friends."
5,A Must Have For Any Aspiring Filmaker,"A fascinating portrait, the film is just riverting, but it is the director's comentary that really blew me away. Rather then the usual ancdotes of filmaking, this lecture is a how-to for low budget filmakers. Just Great."
4,Great for plein-air sketching,"Lightweight & compact. I carry this stool in my bike panniers with my other art supplies. I take it with me when traveling by plane for the same purpose; it fits in a suitcase. It is not as comfortable as my older, not as compact, 4-legged folding stool. This stool cuts off my circulation at the back of my upper thighs so my legs fall asleep. I've relieved this somewhat by placing a small folded hand towel in the seat to build it up."
4,Light weight camping stool,This stool is very light weight and well constructed. It will fit into a back pack. I do bike touring and I needed something that would not take up too much room nor weigh much. This stool fit my needs.
5,"Tocqueville, Democracy In America","As I read this wonderful book I was struck how very intuitive the author was. He outlines what he has observed of our country and then writes what he thinks what the furture holds for us. I was impressed with how he examined not just the body politic of America but its people, values and mores ( I so enjoyed the useage of his words). A remarkable book."
3,Good read but goes on too long,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book but just thought that it went on too long. Also, some of the characters that were introduced near the middle of the book were not as well developed as others. I would have liked to have had more details about some of the characters, such as her mom and dad. It would have been nice to have known more about Maggie's relationship with them in her later years and fewer of the animal stories."
4,Very enjoyable :),"I really enoyed this book. Each chapter was a wonderful story. My only complaint, several ""chapters"" needed to be 2 or 3 chapters longer to sew up the loose ends. Other than that, excellent !"
3,Enjoyable,The beginning is really well done. I was convinced this was autobiographical for a long time. When I realized it was a work of fiction it made me start questioning the choices the author had made regarding the timing and character development.All in all it was enjoyable...I read it for the vet stories.
4,"Surprisingly engaging ""memoir"" of a country vet.","Carolyn McSparren's novel All God's Creatures is a superbly written and thoroughly entertaining narrative on the life of one Tennessee female veterinarian. Despite the relatively simple theme, country vet treats an array of animals; the book is surprisingly rich in emotion and slice-of-life drama. Each chapter most amusingly details the many adventures and misadventures our heroine encounters on a daily basis. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes these thoroughly ordinary people and events so wonderful to read about except perhaps Ms. McSparren's expert skill at capturing the wonder of the human spirit. Every animal lover will love this novel, and those that don't will perhaps gain a glimpse into the amazing capacity of the human heart to love ""All God's Creatures."""
2,Missing pages,"All God's Creatures is written well and is quite amusing at times. The Kindle version, however, has many pages missing."
3,A comfortable but drawn out story.,"This story is very good, especially for awhile but then starts to lose its appeal. It gets too drawn out and loses its flavor. Also, I love the Southern heart-warmth, but it becomes almost too predictable with everything always working out in 'happily ever after.' I guess I like reads with a bit more edge."
5,all god's creatures,"Carolyn McSparren is a new author to me, but not any more! If you love animals (as I do!), don't miss this book! Was a bit skeptical, as she is a vet & I was afraid it might get too graphic, as I love the animals but could never ""fix 'em up"" ---don't worry, a truly loving & moving story about a female vet & her family, her friends & her vet clinic. I couldn't put it down, a lovely story that guides you through her life, with animals, her friends & family, a must read!"
4,Enjoyable to read,"I enjoyed reading ""All God's Creatures."" It is told from the point of view of the book's main character. The book is about Maggie, who forges her own chosen path in life and follows that path with focus. The writing style and use of humor really made the book an easy read. The book is a collection of bits and pieces (memories of life events and memorable cases) in sequence (not a flowing story) making it easy to put down and then pick back up. However, if you're looking for a ""warm and fuzzy"" collection of animal stories, this is not the book. At times, I would have liked to see Maggie show more compassion for the animals she treated. The book is about the life of a female country vet, not about the animals. I especially enjoyed the ending."
5,"If you love animals, this is a must read",This was such a good book that I really hated it when I got to the last page. I wanted to keep reading. I can't wait to read Carolyn McSparren's next book.
4,Enjoyable,"I didn't realize at first this was not an actual memoir, but I did find it very readable and enjoyable. I'm an animal person, grew up on a ranch with livestock and pets and do enjoy this kind of a read.My criteria for this specific type of book is, of course, the Herriot books, which are certainly difficult to compete with. I found this book very accurate and knowledgeable about the veterinary work. The specific stories were particularly entertaining for me and I would have liked more of them.I found the family life portion, the angst regarding the clash between family and career and particularly the turmoil following the husband's death, much less interesting."
4,Engaging Vet Story,"Comparison to James Harriot books was misleading, but McSparren weaves an assortment of real vet experiences into an engaging novel. She created several likeable and realistic characters. One of those books that makes one care enough about the characters that you're sorry to see the story end."
5,Strength,Reading this book can give you a new perspective on life. I know Maggies husband will forever be a role model for me.
5,Ranks with Herriot's books,"This is really a terrific book. If I had gotten it in physical form instead of for the Kindle, I'd place it on my shelves right beside my James Herriot books. It's well written and the stories that make up the whole range from humorous to lump in the throat. My only smallest of criticisms would be that it covers a vet's life from before vet school till retirement age and does seem a bit long, and typos appeared too often in the last half of the book. Maybe if I hadn't been so taken with it that I read it all in one swoop I wouldn't have felt that way about the length of it."
2,Not so great,"There is a genre of humor that uses complaints as its basis. I don't really find it all that funny. The first couple chapters of this book fit solidly into this genre. I tried skipping a few chapters further on but it never really caught my attention. I bought the book because it's description compared it to the famous All Creatures Great and Small series but it didn't come up to that standard. I finished it but, to tell you the truth, I already don't really remember much of it."
3,TLC,A very enjoyable read. It lacks the heart and soul of the obvious British literary comparison. The book covers the whole career of a vet from beginning to end.
4,"Good, enjoyable book","I thought this book was enjoyable. It is really a collection of experinces of Maggie McClain rather than a book with a speficic plot. There really is no plot to speak of it is simply the story of Maggie and her family. Even so, it is still a good book that is worth reading."
5,Simple Elegance,"The Perfume is pure excellenceIt's not your ordinary citrus, ""sport"" or fresh perfume.It is a perfume on its own liege.the scent takes me back home, when the tropical rain absorbers the dirt of the earth.Just think of you standing somewhere in the rainforest, in the middle of a field/hill, you feel the fresh rain pore down on you into the earth. You can smell the dirt, rain, rocks and trees aromas surround you. that TERRE in french for Earth after all.a very Earthly Cologne."
5,love it,I got really good deal and i love it love love it this for low price .I looked up the price on other website and i got the best deal here so I am going to buy it from here only now on ...
5,Amazing smell,"The best gift I could eve give my husband, smells great, he gets tons of compliments when he wears it."
4,The best,"I haven't used a lot of perfumes in my life. The last one I used was Ferrari Black and I had to pour it on me to actually smell nice a little. But this one is great. Just a little and I smell awesome all day. My friends want to know what I am using but I am keeping it a secret for now. Oh no maybe I shoudnt be writing this review coz when they search my name, amazon reviews comes up in the first page."
2,If you liked the original Polo....,"After reading all the glowing reviews on this scent, I thought it would be one of the best scents on the market. I don't own this product but I did try it and I was terribly disappointed. So because this isn't a scent that's easily found in Macy's I thought I'd post my review of what I thought of it. To me it smelled almost exactly like the original Polo Ralph Lauren (green bottle), which I also don't care for. But it does have remarkable stay power--about two hours after spraying it on my arm I washed my arm and I can still smell the fragrance. If you're a fan of the original Polo and you're out then by all means give this a try."
2,disappointed,"I was expecting so much more from Terre DHermes given the reviews. It has a woody smell but it doesn't smell like an expensive cologne. I tend to like fresh smelling colognes like the Aqua Di Gio, Armani Black, Issey Miyake, Prada Infusion, Jean Paul Gaultier. Any of these is much better than this one. Its not long-lasting either. May be it works for others but not for me, this was a huge disappointment."
2,Slightly worse than mediocre; smells of burnt wood and citrus rinds.,"I am a fan of many different types of fragrances. Right now I've been using YSL's L'homme quite a bit. Trying D'Hermes after wearing that felt like a major downgrade and disappointment.To me this was an obnoxious scent; burnt wood and shaved citrus rinds sums it up nicely. Not only that but it is a very overpowering burnt wood and citrus. With only two sprays and even after hours it was still up my nose, and I know everyone within a 20' radius in the grocery store could smell it as well. If you're into that then I highly recommend this EDT. It has good staying power and good sillage; unfortunately in the case of a scent this bad that is not something to brag about.I should mention I bought the EDT and not the parfum."
4,fantastic smell. not long lasting enough,"It lasts only for 3 hours of so.Not sure if Amazon has kept them for too long. Probably that's why they have a discount. When I received the fragrance, there was dust on the bottle inside the paper box.But I am very pleased with the smell if it. Very refreshing."
2,Not so great!,"Given Jean-Claude Ellena's fame, and all the hype about Terre D'Hermes, this scent is not at all popular. The notes by themselves are great. It is only for very specific kind of people. Almost all of the young folks have seriously found the scent, unbearable. Do not wear it for a concert and/or singles night out! For the price, it is simply not justified. One suggestion to big perfume houses, keep the top notes simple and easy, base notes need to be convivial, you may experiment with the middle notes however."
4,Great scent,"I always enjoy Hermes fragrances and this one kept up the tradition. A very rich scent, yet balanced with freshness. A classic as far as I am concerned!"
5,This is the best...,"I haven't worn cologne in many years, then I came across Terre d'Hermes while taking my daughter shopping. A unique scent, at once sexy, earthy, refreshing, and joyous. What more could you ask for?"
5,The best fragrance I have encountered!,I love this fragrance. Very pleasant. Almost indescribable. I love that woody side. It lasts the whole day. In the future I doubt if I will buy any other than this.For the first time a lady walking behind me asked what cologne I was wearing?
5,Very Good Long Lasting,This is a very good fragrance from a french designer. I have tried to move to others but keep coming back. It is a very Woody fragrance that fully matures in about 30 minutes. It stays on longer than any others that I have used. I always get complements and requests for the name of the fragrance. Highly recommended. Also wanted to mention that I always found it cheapest at Amazon and never had issues with my purchase.
5,It Took Me Back,"Terre D'Hermes takes me back to Corsicana, Texas - a local drugstore where I got ice cream after visiting the eye doctor. Three times a week my mother drove me to the eye doctor for eye therapy to help correct my ""lazy eye.""Whirling discs, eye patches, 3-D glasses flipped every hour, drops, flashlights in the dark - all worked to give me control of my eyes. Well, the surgery at age seven didn't hurt either. Wait! Yes it did!But, now I am able to keep my eyes straight.Three times a week the 60 mile trek in our old Buick let me come closer to controlling my eye positions. And, after each visit, my mother would take me into the drugstore for ice cream. But the scent wasn't ice cream.Terre D'Hermes has an incredible earthy scent. It has tones of earth, fern, musk (the good kind), bark, green - and some magical reminder scent of that drug store.People always compliment me when I wear it. Close friends say, ""You're wearing that amazing scent again.""Yes, I am."
5,1st time user,"I don't even need to write an ""essay"" reviewing the product. The photos that I uploaded said it all.I am a recent college graduate (not a geezer) and I the take the risk of purchasing this Hermes without visiting the mall to test it out because of the research I have done. Good reviews and video recommendation by many users.It arrived this afternoon after I got off from school, and I tested it out. I think I am going to love it and treasure it. The scent might not last very long, but it is good enough for me and it feels like that I just went out from a shower.I definitely will use this one again after 5 years and abandon the cheap AXE from Walmart because whenever I smell the AXE from a guy, I got so bored already. It feels elegant to wear Hermes, and at least it is more classy."
4,"beautiful, complex scent","The scent is incredible! It has all these tones very well combined, and it's not sweet (I don't like sweet scents). I first tried this in an airport: I sprayed some on one of those paper sample thingies and as I was heading to my gate for my connecting flight I found myself sniffing it over and over. A few weeks later I tried it again in a store and I knew I had to get it.One piece of advice tho: GET THE Eau de Parfum! The EDT doesn't last."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon!,"Like most people I don't like buying cologne online because there are so many fakes sold on the internet. However, when I saw that this item was shipped directly from Amazon I thought it must be legitimate. Well, since then my cologne has arrived and boy was I WRONG!The box comes wrapped in hard plastic like most new cologne, this made me believe it was new and un-opened, wrong again. They must have put it in this plastic themselves.On the bottom of the box, the serial numbers have been cut off, and this cut covered by a white sticker. Seeing this made me realize already something was up, why would Amazon do this?So I open the box, and the INSIDE of the box is ripped. This obviously means that someone has already previously opened this box. This was all the proof I needed.I can't tell you about the cologne itself as I didn't spray it so that I can return this. I can't believe amazon sent something like this to me."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this hoping to sweep leaves that come into our garage, but it is flimsy, lightweight and bent. It doesn't lie flat on the ground, so what is the point. The handle is heavier than the bin, so you need to hold it down. It says heavy gauge/heavy duty, but it is not. I would sent it back but shipping was more than it costs."
3,A Bit Flimsy,"Should have been constructed out of a heavier gauge metal. It tends to torque. I would not buy again, nor recommend."
5,Un-put-downable,I pursued this book after a small blurb by a local independent bookseller. I read it all in one day and the characters and the emotions that the evoked in me are still staying with me. I now want to read more about Chernobyl and the horrible mistruths that took place .This book was touching yet not a downer.
1,Yech!,Unattractive and cheaply made. Fiona's skirt is very delicate will be lost after only a few kicks. Also very ugly.
3,very skimpy for price,"This doll is so small compared to the other shrek action figures available for the same price. It is kind of dissapointing. Also, we can't really get any high kick action out of Fiona."
3,A fun speed-read,"While a lot of it is sped through, and it is very cliche-ridded (is that the right word >.<), I would still say this is a good read. I noticed a few similarities between this story and the Zelda lines, the most obvious being the orphan finding the princess, but all in all, I enjoyed it.As for the depth of the book, I can say it was predictable, but for a light read, that's essential. I didn't want to have to think about what was going on too much--I have Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series for that-- so it was a nice change of pace. I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a quick, fun read.The one thing I really didn't like about it was the typos. Typos are major for me! But, with the re-release, I'm sure those I had seen were fixed.And I jsut want to say that the first book in a series is never the best that author can do. Give it time, it'll get better, I promise! (I actually can't wait for Saberondan, 'cause I think her minstrel's gonna be in it! He's a cool kinda guy...)"
1,Forced,"The worst thing about this book is the characters, I have to admit it. One sided, one dimensional. I think the term i want to say is ""cookie cutter""...The other thing though that I notices was the drab prose. Never even in the writing groups I've been to with complete novices have I read something so forced and pretentious. Every line that is churned out lacks spirit or creativity. There is no verve, no spark, just forced, forced, forced prose. It's like, ""look what I can do""!! kind of writing.I've read this writer's fanfictions and this is just like them. There was never any spark of imagination to the story, and never any creativity to the prose."
1,sugared honey gone bad,"Flamewars out of the way for a second, here's my honest review. This book was exactly like this: take a pint of honey, add a few tablespoons of sugar, and then let it sit in the hot summer sun for about a month and then drink it all down at once.The tone, the author's voice, the various cliche phrases are all so saccharine that it makes you sick to your stomach. It tries real hard to be gritty in some places, but those places are just lifted from every other story and then watered down. Even fantasy stories should have something to relate to real life, real human emotions. This doesn't at all. It just kind of plods along, saccharine cliche after saccharine cliche.And, sorry, but I have to add like everyone else that the characterization was totally flat.And, yes, ripped off of Legend of Zelda."
1,Dull......,"Sorry, I tried really hard but couldn't get pat the first two chapters even. This book isn't even edited. Most of all it wasn't compelling in any way, none of the characters were interesting. I guess it's good for young kids who don't want to be too challenged, whom it doesn't take much to get them into a story."
1,Amateur,"The book is honestly very amateurish. It didn't hold my interest at all, it was flat and dull. There are a lot of mistakes in the text. It just didn't flow!"
1,Poor,"This would not even get an A in high school English class.About the book itself, one thing I noticed was how one dimensional the characters were. [...] I hate to just repeat what everyone else said, but these characters were just little snippets and sound bites of movies with no real feeling to them.I won't give away the end, but I have to say that it wasn't suprising. Not only that, but I actually didn't care what happened to Falen, if he lived or died (again I won't spoil the ending, not that I could, because anyone with a brain who has seen a movie or two will know the entire story anyway.) It was hard to either like him or hate him, he was just super boring. No personality. That goes for the entire book."
1,this sums up my feelings on this book.,"you're just a bluffer, a candle snuffer,can't get enough of your dreamsa half a buffer, a pillow stufferyou're bound to suffer it seemsyour head is full of dreams -to turn the world around.But all your fancy dreamare from the lost and found."
5,"Love, Faith, Fighting and Wit, what more could you ask for?","I found this book to be quite well written. Although it does have a handful of grammatical errors, it isn't a bother and can be fixed in future editions.(To tell the truth, I found more errors in a few of the translated editions of ""The Idiot"" by Dostoevsky within 400 pages)It is written with a special blend of styles, ranging from battle sequences like Lord of the Rings, to the various comical dialogues between the two center character's that reminds me of Waistcoat, Sash and Umbra from the Onslaught series of Magic: the Gathering, and the kind of faith in a higher being or power that was prevailant back during the Romantic era of Literature. This makes for a refreshing style of writing for a new Author.[...]"
1,Nonsense,"Vanity press nonsense. Not an original thought or turn of phrase in the entire thing. And yes, it is mostly lifted from Legend of Zelda."
2,Fantasy Doth Not Excuse...,"After hearing so much about this book, I finally bought it. What a waste of money! There are things that happen in the book, ways people relate to others that would NEVER happen in real life. The author stresses that it's fanatasy, but is a fantastic book an excuse for all of this? It was so unbelievable and fake that I didn't make it past the 30th page!"
5,Cam,I'm a caregiver for an elderly parent. The organizer is a simple way to give me confidence that I am giving the right medications at the right time. I used to spend a lot of time double checking myself. Now I have time to do things like write reviews on great products like this that make my life easier :). I particularly like this organizer because it provides for 4 different dispense times each day. Highly recommended.
4,Useful for elderly,"Use this for the in-laws to keep the pills straight. Load it up once a week, and they are less likely to make a mistake"
5,Great Product,"I purchased several of these. Since I only take my medication twice a day, I get 2 weeks out of each one. I can set up an entire months supply of medication at one time. This makes it easy to determine if I missed a dose. I also use one for my daily vitamins. The best part is, I only have to open my bottles once a month now. And when I go on a trip, I just wrap it in some plastic wrap to make sure nothing in my luggage pops open any tabs and just peel back the wrap to get to todays pills.Product is nice and big. I take 8 pills at a time and still have plenty of room left over for more.Everyone who takes medications or vitamins should own at least one."
5,Works great for many pills,I have to take a large amount of pills throughout the day and even my big pills fit well. I don't know if you are using a huge amount of large supplements if it would work for you. They are easy to snap and unsnap even with my tremors. I would say that if you need something child resistant this is not for you.
4,I Like . . . Dirty Words!,"It was a smoggy California day as I walked into BookStore. Nasty. Tweaking my lungs. Making me want to hurl one onto the sidewalk.This was the place that I discovered M. Christian. As I walked into the dive, a clerk sneered at me. I'd hoped for a greeting. But Buffy was having a bad day.EroticaAnthology called to me from a bookshelf. ""Sssssshhhhh!"" Hissed a snotty employee. M. Christian's historical erotica jumped off the page at me. I was startled.I would soon get into the harder stuff: Dirty Words.""Authentic, literate, twisted, edgy . . . noir, eros and humor meet speculative fiction. . . throw in a classic film sensibility. An imaginative and hot read! I'd definitely recommend Dirty Words, especially for those readers who are looking for something different."""
2,Disappointing,"One of those writers with little to say but who says it over and over again, Christian has some sparks, but they never get lit. There's a level of not-quite-authentic writing that bothers me each time I come across his writing, so I really can't recommend this book."
3,Good for FLES,"This was published in 1967 so there's nothing ""flashy"" here but there are solid ideas for a K-6th level program. The book is 33 pages long and chapter are on the alphabet, colors, numbers, weather, months/days, time, and Miscellaneous. There are only two activities that might interest highschoolers, a weather game and a bean bag toss game."
2,motorized golf ball cleaner,doesn't really do a good job; kind of messy to use; you get what you pay for
1,Don't waste your money,"Do not waste your money, it is preferable to have a toothbrush and soap, works better and with out batteries."
2,Perfect Blocks,"Haven't started making anything but it looks like a lot of work. I saw it on TV and she made it look easy, but not from what I see in the book."
3,Simpler--Maybe,"This is an exacting way to make blocks, but the preparation time takes many more minutes than I anticipated. It's not the simple that I was looking for."
5,Truth stranger than fiction,"""Prisoners"" is a true story presented in a gripping fictional manner.This novel will evoke both pride and shame in dealing with the dehumanizing effects of war.It's a ""can't put down"" read.Jerome Ferdinand"
4,An Excellent Gift,"This volume contains a fine selection of poems by well know poets, and newcomers. All are accessable, and many are amusing and memorable. The small size of the volume makes it perfect for a gift. Or, you may want keep it by your bed and use it to get aquainted with the current gay poetry scene."
3,predictability spoils the story.....,"While Miss Collum has a writing style that is for the most part, pleasing-I must agree with the other reviewer that stated that the characters ""thinking"" things instead of acting bogged this book down excessively.Something was missing, there was no ""umph""-it took me 3 days to plod through, and I fell asleep three times while reading it-never a good sign.The final irritation for me was, while the heroine was described on the back as a ""vicar's spinster daughter""-but, lo and behold, she transform into a beauty upon arrival at the house party. The explanation being she had been unseen in the country, and with helping her father-highly implausible-a beauty in the country would have been chased by all the local squires sons no matter how small the town.2 stars for a interesting storyline, if not for it's execution."
4,Good Regency,I found Elizabeth and the Major delightful. Funny and fast paced. I bought it when I was it won The Affaire de Coeur Critic's Award for Best Regency. It was worth the bit extra for an out of print book.
3,Vertex 1996,"This a hard cd to review for me. I've only had it for a little while but so far I like about half of it. It's experimental & sometimes it seems to work, other times it doesn't work as well. It would depend heavily on your taste as to whether or not you'll like it. It seems like one of those albums that people will either like or not like with very few saying ""it's ok"". Ya know?"
5,Babymole loves tea,This is my all time favorite tea book and I have a pretty big selection.For such a whimsical book the recipes featured are quite delicious and much more creative than some that I have found in many other books. This book exceeded my expectations above and beyond. I would highly recommend to any tea lover and I never write reviews. This book demanded it.
4,childhood treasures,"I loved these books as a child, the fact that you can follow the fortunes of one family from generation to generation. The story of a large polish farming family, and the many farms they inhabit are well written and provide a good perspective on american history as well as some interesting traditions"
3,The Music of Cosmos - To Buy - or Not to Buy,"I want to buy this album badly, but some of the previous comments on the 'in-between effects' scares me off. I will probably buy it anyway, but if I hated the extra stuff, I would transfer the CD's to my computer, then burn each track back onto new CD's. If I did this, would it get rid of the effects, or are they integral to the tracks. Has anyone tried to do this?"
5,"Simply, Excellent !","Simply, excellent album, no more words !!!A great souvenir from the TV series of the 80's and a great selection made by Mr. Carl Sagan.The music of COSMOS is the music of all the world. Don't miss it if possible because this is a great treasure.There is also the other version, only one CD, so good as the TV series."
4,"Better Than Original, But...","Excellent 2 disk compilation of inspiring classical, electronic & some rock. For the most part better than original Cosmos LP. Biggest pluses: Much greater length than original. Much better mixing. Drawbacks that keep this from rating a 5: Liked the mix of the Vangelis song Heaven & Hell from the original better than on this CD; sound effects between tracks annoying as they were in original; I agree w/ another reviewer that Aquarius track is annoying, but not that it doesn't fit, the song WAS in one of the Cosmos episodes (the one discussing so call astrology and the birth of astronomy), and the album is called Cosmos, meaning it covers life, the universe & everything to quote Douglas Adams."
2,Not as easy as I thought,I bought this bundle really only for the cable and software to connect my phone to my computer. This proved to be difficult after a night of attempts I found the customer service # on the Motorola website. The next day I called my friends in India at Motorola (who were very helpful and pleasant) and they told me that the software I had was not the the correct version for my phone (although it should have been) so they emailed me the correct software and it worked fine from there.
5,H&H,"The book is excellent; brings back childhood memories. The mac and cheese recipe is missing the tomatoes, so I added them. Was in heaven. Thanks for excellent service."
5,I consider it a cook book,"Even if you have no interest in the history of the automat whatsoever, the recipes for American comfort food classics contained within are mostly great, and those that aren't are easily modified to taste. Everything is easy to prepare in large batches and it all keeps extremely well in the fridge, so you can cook yourself silly on the weekend and have leftovers throughout the week. Cheaper, better tasting, and healthier than any fast food you're likely to find. It's a darn shame these places went the way of the dodo, but if the economy keeps on crumbling maybe we'll get them back."
2,"Good, could be better","While is it great to see all the old pix, few if any have an address attached to them which would make ""remembering"" easier. The chapters do not flow from one to another and the time line goes back and forth, which is confusing. I wasn't interested in the recipes so cannot comment on them.Still worth to buy it for the memories."
3,"Five stars for nostalgia, three stars for content","Five stars for nostalgia, three stars for content.This book brought back memories and for that it gets five stars. The Automat was the best part of our trips to Manhattan, even beating out the Museum of Natural History. I don't remember the food at all but putting those coins in the slots and picking up my prize will be forever etched in my mind. My main problem with the content is how it is organized. I found it choppy and at times hard to follow. The text can go from the 40s to the 60s and back to the 30s all on one page.It appears to be a compilation of notes and facts without much order or flow. Buy it for the memories and you'll get what you pay for. If you're looking for more, you'll be as disappointed as you'd be if you tried to get a nickle lunch today."
4,But the recipes aren't there...,As someone who grew up in Philadelphia it was fun reading about my childhood memories. The big problem is the derth of recipes.The original ones. I have been writing to cookbook publishers for years begging for a Horn & Hardart Cookbook. I thought this would be it since it was written by a relative of one of the founders. No such luck. But if you have only heard about The Automat and never eaten there this is a fun read about a very special place.
3,Wholesome Reading,Very loving story. Makes you want to go back to the good old days when people looked out for each other.
5,Wonderful book,This book tugged at my heartstrings in a truly moving and wonderful way. I loved the complexity of the characters -- all of them. The author's deft handling of the path that is shaken by unexpected trauma was superb. I also loved the town of Rosewood that she created. I want to read everything else this author has written. That hasn't happened since I discovered Jan Karon. This book will stay in my bookshelves forever.
2,This is punk?,"Yeah, some of it is okay. I'm a fan of both Punk AND Emo/Screamo. This is def a bait and switch though. You could tell Anti-Flag was thrown on there to gain street cred with the punk crowd. But anyone that actually listens to punk would shut this off before even getting to that far in the album. Jack's Mannequin is punk?I think they should have done two cd's. Emo Goes Acoustic and Punk Goes Acoustic. Put the stuff on the right CD so people don't grab it expecting something totally not what they are promoting."
2,Flavor of the Week,"This is a fair to decent CD for what it is, and it's nice to see a ""Punk Goes"" disc that isn't full of cover songs for once. With that being said, Punk Goes Acoustic 2 is still nothing more than a cash in by Fearless Records, a ""Now 20″ or whatever for alternative music fans. The majority of this disc is filled with the latest pop rock/emo flavors of the week, Anti-Flag and Set Your Goals are merely thrown in for street cred (as attested to by their track numbers).I'm not bashing this CD because it's not ""punk"", most of the band's put on a good performance, but it's hard not to laugh at a record that features Daphne Loves Derbe and the Spill Canvas next to a band like Anti-Flag. I think Jello Biafra would have a thing to say about this.Buy this if you can't get over your 7th grade girlfriend."
3,The Last Gunfighter Ghost Valley,"The book was good over all but Johnstone has started to depend way too much on flashbacks, which is ok if you haven't read any of the previous books in the series. You end up reading more and more of the old book in the new book"
2,Same story different title,"Ghost Valley was a series of flashbacks from previous books. The story line was almost the same as the last book with different names, even the dialog was the same. I have loved all of William Johnstone's books, but could have saved money by skipping this and just rereading Reprisal. Hopefully the next book will have a different plot and characters."
2,Skip this one...,"I love the Last Gunfighter series and the tales of Frank Morgan. However, I agree with the other reviews that this book was a copy of the book before it. My sources tell me that the author possibly wrote this book at the same time that he began chemotherapy, but still the editor should have done his job. My suggestion is to skip this book. Or spend 5 minutes breezing through it in a book store somewhere. Then buy the next book in the series and continue with this series. Don't give up on it cause the next book in the series is one of the best!"
4,good reading,"this book was for my husband, he is reading the entire series and realy likes them. he is on his 13th book in the series"
2,Photo album,I am very impressed with the photo album. The front is covered with some kind of beautiful leaves that makes this album very unique. I ordered several for Xmas gifts and each of them have just a little something that makes them unique. I would recommend these for a hard to find a gift person!
3,Hidden Camera no es ninguna maravilla.,"Si buscas sexo explicito, no compres este libro. Si buscas un argumento apasionante o inteligente, tampoco. En Hidden Camera encontraras una serie de historias cortas con un transfondo erotico, y el excelente dibujo de Manara, pero poco mas. Basicamente se trata de las historia protagonizadas por Honey, el delicioso personaje de Milo, que trabaja para un grupo que realiza grabaciones con camara oculta, normalmente con alguna orientacion sexual, para venderlas para la television. Personalmente Me decepciono un poco."
5,A misterious Album.,By listenning to this album you are stepping in misterious but joyful world.You see and hear things that are strange but pleasent.Ii is all your feelings that you could not express them in better way.After this many years I still enjoy it alot.
3,"Nice hat, good materials, but the rim is too narrow","The hat looks like it is made out of good material. It fits nicely, and looks good. However, the rim of the hat is narrow, so it doesn't protect the neck from the sun. Would have been better to have a wider rim."
1,Unbelievable!,"This has to be one of the most ridiculous books ever written. In one story, a woman blames a ghost for her missing sports bra and in another, Sharon Gill, one of the authors, misplaces two photography books and accuses a ghost of taking them! If ghosts were responsible for missing books, my house would be literally crawling with spirits!Also included is a tale about the ghost of a mutilated woman at Watch Hill Lighthouse in Westerly, Rhode Island. In the story, an ""unnamed"" individual sees the ghost, then goes to the local library and discovers the apparition is that of a woman named Edith Whiting who was murdered by her husband in 1885. Having a keen interest in haunted lighthouses, I contacted the Watch Hill Lighthouse Association requesting additional information and discovered the story was a total fabrication!In my opinion, the authors of this book are irresponsible people who pander to the gullible and care nothing for the accuracy of what they produce."
2,Disappointed,"I read the first series by this author (starting with ""Battleaxe"") and I thought it was really good. I thought that the departure from Anglo-centric racial (and sexual) stereotypes in a fantasy novel was refreshing (cf. Eddings et al). I eagerly plunged into the new series, but I was disappointed to find it lacked a good plot and I was bored by about halfway through this novel. I persevered with the remaining two, but I found the characters and events became increasingly ludicrous the more I read. I got the feeling that the author was sick of writing about the characters during this series. The magic system was also a little shaky; the characters' abilities were undefined which allowed the author to let them to escape from seemingly impossible situations by conveniently inventing new abilities. It made the story seem unplanned and the world that Douglass has spent so many pages describing, unbelievable. I recommend the first series, but don't bother with this one."
2,Alert for tender sensibilities. (slight spoiler alert),"It has been a bit since I read this book. The main caveat that I would like to let people in on is that the brutality level jumps SIGNIFICANTLY with this book in the series. Some of it is fairly nauseating. I was mostly upset by this in that having read the first trilogy one would come to expect a certain ""rating,"" if you will, and having it jump from pg-13 (behind closed doors, commented on afterwards rape) to NC-17 (Forced aborting of a pregnancy by the mother, open rape of 2-3 characters) is disconcerting at the least. I think she has a lot of intreguing ideas, but that was the main shocker for me."
1,Reported toy to US Consumer Product Safety Commission,This product is a piece of junk and a horrible choking hazard. As you will read the head and lower jaw pop off but also Donkey's ears come off. This was my toy but my two year old got a hold of it and broke the ear off in his mouth. I will be returning this product and will not buy another.(...) I strongly urge anyone who bought this product to write the CPSC about this so they can issue a recall on it.
2,"Maybe the WORST made ""action"" toy ever!","I wish I could have given this one a ZERO for durability because it has earned it.This toy has perhaps the worst design of any action figure/toy I have ever seen. It took my son less than 2 minutes of play to pop of the Donkey's jaw and then his head.The jaw is not secured in place at all. It is meant to hinge open and closed to allow the donkey to ""talk"" during play. This is not very satisfying when the jaw immediately comes off. The head is meant to nod up and down and suffers from the same malady. The cheap plastic pegs holding it in place do not do their job. If you want a toy to ""look at"" and not touch then this is the toy for you...If you are looking for play value this one is a zero."
1,I hate this toy!,"My favorite character in Shrek is Donkey. One day, I got this Mule Kickin' Donkey. When I started to play with the toy, his head popped off. When I tried to put the head back on, his jaw fell off! I told my parents about this. First they didn't believe me that the toy had a defect, they didn't believed me. But when I showed them, they were shocked with the toy. We went back to TOYS ""R"" US and reported this and exchanged it. I got Puss in Boots instead because he was my next favorite character and I liked it. The people who reported this, they were right! Down with Donkey! Get Puss in Boots!"
3,"We agree, Donkey's head falls apart.","We read these reviews but still took a chance with this toy when we bought the ""Shrek 2 Action Packed Figure: Punchin' Shrek."" The Shrek toy is great, very durable. But after only a minute or so of gentle play, Donkey's head fell right off. When reattaching it, his jaw proceeded to fall off. After reassembling Donkey repeatedly, we retired him to a shelf, to be looked at but not touched. :("
1,The beheading of Donkey,"After finally finding this Donkey that my Granddaughter wanted so badly, I was very disappointed. I had barely gotten him out of the package and went to give him to her and his head fell off. She then picked his head up to hand to me to fix and his jaw popped off. Does Hasbro seriously expect children to be able to play with this character? Shame on them!!!!!!!!! My Granddaughter wanted a toy she could play with as she loves the movie Shrek. This toy is for display only because you certainly can't play with it."
4,This Toy Really ISN'T So Bad,"I have heard a lot of people complaining about this toy on this particular website, but I don't think that it's really as bad as some people say it is.Yes, the head and jaw can occasionally fall off, but it is surely nothing that you cannot fix in just a matter of seconds.I don't know about you other people out there, but I find this toy somewhat enjoyable and durable."
5,Love this,"This product is amazing. Simply break the Ampule and save the rest in a small travel jar. I put the remainder in the fridge. I love , love this product. This is my second time purchasing. Friends and family noticed a huge difference with my skin.For those of you not fimiliar, this product plumps up fine lines and wrinkles and it really works beautifully. If you are looking for said results, I would purchase this product."
4,Very cool,So interesting to see a documentary made up of home movies. So cool! Jack Clement was a genius and a cut-up!
1,Not a good Richard Bach read.,"i'm a big richard bach fan...and i got to say this one was just boring. it's not peppered with philosophical sentances or inspirational words, it's just a book for plane fanatics. if you go to a bookstore, you'll find this particular bach book tucked in the ""transporation"" section. a little different from his other works."
4,This early book shows a lot of pilot and a little philosophy,"If you read Illusions or one of Richard Bach's later booksfirst, as I did, you will find this to be quite a differentread. This story of trading a modern plane for a WWIbiplane and then flying it across the country was writtenby a pilot for an audience of pilots. His way of looking atthe world comes through, even though it seems he was tryingto write a book for persons who like biplanes. If you likedone of his later books and just want to read every sentecehe wrote (as I did after Illusions) this is not such a badread. If you also like biplanes, you got it made!"
2,Poke-Through Alert!,"Though this is some of the softest bathroom tissue you'll ever use, and it has an excellent texture designed to clean every nook and cranny, I've had several serious poke-through incidents.Bathroom tissue is graded on three critical factors:1) Softness2) Debris Removal3) Puncture ResistanceOn the first two points Cottonelle exhibits perfect scores. Unfortunately, the combination of softness plus the friction generated by the super effective debri removing texture, results in a high likelihood of finger poke-through making this product virtually nonfunctional."
1,did not fit properly 89 Jeep Comanche,the price was great but this did not fit the lower bracket on my 89 Jeep Comanche. I could have modifyed it to fit perhaps but I'll just take it back and get the Pioneer part from autozone.Don't fool with this part.
4,Pretty good for what it is.,"As Math textbooks go, this one's pretty good. It has a nice variety of problems for the student to work at the end of each subchapter, from easy ones to advanced ones, and the explanations are actually not bad. As a supplement to a course on Statistics, this is a very useful book. As with almost all Math texts, of course, it is almost completely useless on its own; it's a very rare individual indeed who can learn anything from reading a Math textbook without have someone lecturing and explaining the material; this is a problem innate to Math textbooks, given that a textbook cannot tailor the level of explanation to the student and give as much explanation as needed in the areas that the student finds difficult, without insulting the intelligence of the student in all other areas.This book in no way proves an exception to this rule, but it is no worse than most texts in this regard and is actually somewhat better than most."
3,Average STAT 310 Book,"Average STAT 310 Book for Northern Illinois University, Math and Statistics courses. I'm not a fan, so I cannot over rate it."
2,Music,"I bought this for my husband's 60th birthday party since he was born in 1953. It was not a hit, most of the crowd only seemed to remember ""How much was that doggie in the window"". Guess it was meant for our parents."
2,Not what I wanted nor expected,"I purchased this book hoping for recipes for incense and oils but was sadly disappointed. It contained primarily charts listing the various correspondences -- colors, candles, chakras, deities, tarot, stones, etc.If you need a spellcasting reference book to remind you that red is for passion, that saffron is a fire herb, that Marduk was the Great God of Babylon, buy this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Great advice for the business photographer.,"This is a very good book. It is advice aimed at say the town photographer who is taking senior portraits. Its aimed at photographer who are running a business and are a tight deadline where time is money. You won't find any super fancy photoshop techinques in here- instead you will find techniques that quickly let you produce a marketable print to your customers. He also spend a good deal of time on how to cover up problems when your taking the photo, rather then trying to cover them up in photoshop later. While I may not agree with everything in the book I think it a good primer on how a business side studio would have to run, as opposed to a more artistic based studio, where you could perhaps work at a more relaxed pace."
5,Something for everyone!,"As a professional for 17 years there are great common sense tips to getting the best out of a portrait session. The text dealt with everything from posing to lighting to editing tips. I liked that they always tried to fix ""problems"" in the field instead of on the computer and thereby lessened sluggishness in work flow. Even if you're not a consistent portrait photographer, if you occasionally shoot portraits, you'll get something out of this to help your work."
4,"Corrective Lighting, Posing & Retouching for Digital Portrait Photographers",Excellant introductory look at Portrait Photography. Part of the art of getting a good result in portraits is the skill of posing your subject correctly & in such a way that you can overcome any flaws etc. Excellent book for Portrait photographers wanting to do more & develop their skills
2,Unbalanced Presentation,"I have been a Traditionalist for a long time, and never gave much consideration to the Conditionalist view. But Fudge has opened me up to the possibility that he is correct.In the first part of the book each author is given space to present his view. Fudge does a good job I think, while Peterson uses his space to beat up on Fudge. Peterson uses ""classroom"" humor to ridicule Fudge and his position. I find that unprofessional. I would of liked to see Peterson stick to a presentation of the Traditional view in his opening statement so I could better judge it on its own merit apart from other views.I intend to read each author's dedicated volume on this subject: Fudge - ""The Fire That Consumes,"" and Peterson - ""Hell on Trial."" I would like to see them rewrite the above book and stick strictly to the plan. That would be fairer to Peterson and Fudge both, and would serve to ther reader what he expected and paid for."
2,Voices not the best,This book is probably a better read in the paper version. Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story. Not my favorite narrator. Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better.
5,hemlock bay,I have really enjoyed the the FBI thrillers. Dillon Savich and Sherlock have been through a lot together and it keeps getting better.
3,Narrative - Yecht,"Plot line is pretty good and of course, I like Sherlock and Savich. It makes leaps from time to time over obviously edited info. Sometimes there's one crisis right after another with no relief in between (comic or otherwise). The Reader SANDRA BURR is the worst I've heard. She turns suspense dialogue in to very cutesy, sacharine sweet tripe. How you say it does make a difference. YECHT!"
3,Kept my interest while captive on a plane..,"I usually try to read books with some literary, social, educational or cultural value. NOT THIS TIME!! That said, I did finish it and it was better than the in-flight magazine and I had already read the catalog with all the fun Sharper Image & Front Gate toys in it.So if you find this book abandoned in an airport or bus station, pick it up and read it. It's worth the price you paid and it will relieve the boredom of a long flight."
1,very poor effort,"I have read all of Catherine Coulter's books and have enjoyed most all of them. This is the first book of any author that has prompted me to write a review. Do not waste your money on this book! If you feel you must read it, go to the library. Ms. Coulter must have been under a tremendous deadline to have gotten this book; with it's juvenile dialogue and ridiculous plots, through her editor. I just finished the book and am still shaking my head. What was she thinking?"
1,Save your money and your time,"This is possibly one of the poorest written books I've everread. There are too many plot lines and none of them make anysense. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional. It is basically a very silly book. It's not a mystery or a gothic novel, yet it tries to be both. I would recommend that the discerning reader give this book the cold shoulder and find something else, anything else to read."
2,A disappointing Coulter - what a shame.,"At first as I was attempting to read Hemlock Bay, I thought I was just allowing other things to distract me and therefore causing me to lose the flow of the book. I kept reminding myself of how much I had enjoyed reading every other Catherine Coulter book - especially the suspense series involving the FBI characters. But, I finally had to admit, that this one was just not up to Coulter's usual style. Hopefully, she will put this one behind her, and return to her usual style.I'm still wondering about those ""Ghouls"" and Tammy or was it Timmy's acts of illusions!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Having become a avid Catherine Coulter fan, I was very disappointed with this book. Her previous Sherlock/Savich books seemed to have some depth to them, but not this one. The Lily character was very insulting to any woman who has half a brain. The Simon character was slightly better but still trite. The dialog was terrible and the Tammy/Timmy thing was just out there somewhere. I read to be entertained, to travel to places I haven't been and to meet interested people. This book did none of those things."
2,Disappointed,I'm really glad I read the other 5 in this series before I got to this one. Chances are that if I hadn't I would not have bothered to go back and read the others. The characters personalities seemed very childish to me in this book. I didn't feel that a lot of effort and thought went into it.
1,A Real Stinker,"What a waste of time and money. This is one of maybe 5 books I've refused to finish in my life. It's disconnected, scenes are not realistic, feel completely false, and nothing about it kept my interest. The editing is very sloppy, in one place, after the evil Tammy has her arm amputated and escapes from the hospital to murder again, Ms. Coulter has her ""rubbing her bloody hands together"". Maybe it was a misprint, is should have had her ""rubbing her bloody HAND together"", being as she only had one. Immediately following was an unbelievable interaction between Savitch's sister, an art dealer, and an art forger. That did it. I closed it up."
2,What a let-down!,"After reading most of Catherine Coulter's modern day suspence-romance novels, I was looking forward to this one. What a waste of time! I did not like this book at all. I kept thinking maybe a child wrote it under her name! The dialogue seemed too trite at times and did nothing to enhance character development. I also thought she couldn't quite decide which plot to develop, so the two of them just dragged along. It was tough for me to keep reading this book!"
1,"Catherine Coulter, Where are you?","After reading Coulter's other modern mysteries, I couldn't wait to read this one. Boy, was I ever disappointed! While I usually enjoy her characters, especially Dillon and Sherlock, no one had any depth in this poor excuse for a mystery. The characters appeared and then left without much ado. Frankly, after awhile I wished the book would magically disappear. I feel upset at myself for finishing her book because Coulter left her readers feeling unfulfilled right up to the last page. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING IT!"
3,hmm...,"this is my second coulter book and i'm not disappointed, but i'm not satisfied either. there was plenty of action, a little to none romance, and the dialogue was a bit sappy - reminded me of things like barney and care bears.anyway, i'm looking forward to the next - but not that much - just to keep the series going."
1,Hemlock Bay,It has been quite awhile since I ordered this book and my understanding is that Clearbook has had some problems with someone who stole their identity. They did email me back and I gave them my name & address but still have not received the book. I believe I said I would wait but over a month is too long. I may ask them for a refund or at least send me my book. I know it is not their fault but I had to email them to find out the status. Otherwise all of the other books I ordered came in a timely manner. Louise Heyza
1,Don't waste your hard-earned money,"I picked this book up at the library on the day they received it, since it was on display at the entrance of Borders so must be good, right? Wrong. I have never written a review before but just felt that this book was so bad that I wanted to save people the time and effort of getting it. The only reason I finished it was because it was the fastest read I have ever seen, since the language was so insipid that it was as if a high school student had written it for an English project. The two unrelated and poorly resolved plots,were not believable at all, and one kept hoping that something would happen, but nothing ever did. The author jumps back and forth between the plots so many times that you have to read the titles of the chapters or subchapters to know where you are, and after a while you don't really care! This book makes John Grisham look like a genius. THere are so many good books out there-find a different one to enjoy."
1,A Waste of TIme,"I purchased this book for two reasons. First it was on the NYT Bestsellers list. Second it was a FBI thriller. Frankly, it was stupid. I couldn't get over the fact that a publishing house had actually spent money to publish this book. At one point in the story you are reading about being on an airplane and the next sentence jumps to talking about sleeping in a house somewhere, with so-n-so down the hallway. What? When did they get off the plane? Did the author forget to go back and correct the story line? Did anyone bother to proof this book?I was greatly disappointed with this author. I was excited to find a new author, one who had a number of books written, as I am a fast reader and read everything by an author. Unfortunately, I will not buy another book by this author."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS IN THIS SERIES,"I really enjoyed ""The Target"", ""The Cove"", ""The Maze"", ""The Edge"" and ""Riptide"" but this latest addition is disappointing. The characters outside of Dillon and Lacey are boring and one dimensional. The development of an attraction between them is lacking. I still love Coulter's books and hope she continues to write modern stories, but this is only a three."
2,Disappointing,"After reading Catherine Coulter's previous thrillers,I found Hemlock Bay very disappointing. The idea was great but the book dragged. The dialogue was stilted and predictable. Too much romance, not enough mystery and adventure. Maybe she was a little too ambitious this time. What were the Ghouls, anyway? It seems that Coulter dug herself a hole and couldn't get out of it! Even the romance was not believable...I'd recommend you read something else!!"
2,Leading to where???,"I have to say that I was sorely disappointed after finishing this book. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't a book with two unrelated storylines and no romance at all. The spark between Sherlock and Savich are toned down to the point that you don't see the great chemistry between these 2 characters. What you see is a struggle for the author to complete and tie in two unrelated storylines with too many main characters. This book is mainly about Savich and his sister Lily, but since Savich has Sherloch, Lily has to have Simon, her hero. You see no romance or chemistry between Lily and Simon until the last 20 pages. All of a sudden, there's supposedly great love between the two...wait for the paperback or just borrow this book from the library."
2,Fast to Fizzle,"This book has one of the biggest build ups to one of the lousiest climaxes I have read in a long time. It was lacking in closure. How did the antagonist, Tammy Tuttle, change the scenery and disappear? What are the ghouls? How and what killed the 11 boys? I am totally confused."
3,Not bad but not great either,I am a big fan of her fbi books and I try to read them asap so i rushed to this one and i was very disappointed in it. it didn't seem as exciting as her others.
2,Had potential but was too predictable!,"I thought I would really like this Catherine Coulter novel but I was pretty disappointed! It seemed like there were 2 separate stories going on..the one with Savich's sister & her ""dilemma"" and the story of the ""Tuttle twins"". They were pretty OK stories on their own but the plot with Savich's sister was very formulaic & the one with the Tuttle twis was just plain weird! They didn't tie the two stories together at all & Coulter never really gave resolution to the Tuttle story and the ""ghouls"". She never really explained their origin or cause,etc. She just got you to the end of the book and you're at the last page thinking ""...AND.....???"". Not her best work, I'm afraid!"
2,not so good,"not her best effort. in fact, it was quite possibly the weakest plot i've read in some time. both too much and too little going on."
3,liked and disappointment,"The book Hemlock Bay itself was good. I enjoy reading Catherine Coulter books. But, I order a hard back book and I received a paperback book. It was soiled but in fairly readable shape. I contacted you after I received it and was told by e-mail that you were going to send me a hard back copy, but it never came. I never heard from them again."
3,Liked it but not wowed by it!,"In typical Coulter style, this ""FBI Thriller"" included the usual suspects, Savich and Sherlock, who find themselves involved in a family saga and a couple FBI cases. I found the storyline involving Savich's sister Lilly to be interesting and kept me reading. As for the the FBI case involving the Tuttle twins, I kept expecting Coulter to breakout Bishop's unit from author Kay Hooper's 'Evil Trilogy', but, it did not happen. The twin's storyline was wound into Lilly's saga because I think it had in order to hold the reader's attention; otherwise, I don't know if I would have finished the book."
1,hemlock bay,"GAG ME CORNY! I had difficulty finishing this book due to the ""oh... come... on"" factor. I've read many Catherine Coulter books before and enjoyed them; however, this is not one. The rescue from the fire episode was ridiculous. I read that deal out loud to several of my friends and the usual comment after laughter (or during) was ""oh gawd, you've got to be kidding. Who did you say wrote that book?"" Sorry, this book is a waste of the readers time."
3,Paintings in the Balance,"Dillion Savich is busy with a kidnapping case when he learns his sister Lily has driven her car into a tree. Catherine Coulter pours it on in this addition to her successful FBI series. HEMLOCK BAY adds another dimension as Tammy Tuttle reenters the picture seeking revenge.The reading is fast paced with lots of thrills and chills as HEMLOCK BAY will keep the fans turning the pages long into the night. It isn't a question of ""What happens next?"" but ""How soon!""Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
2,Very Disapointed,"As an avid Catherine Coulter fan, especially her previous books including FBI agents Sherlock and Savich, this is not at all what I expected. I would have placed this in the category for fiction, maybe suspense, but certainly not a Romance novel. Story was dull and lacking in romance. The first Coulter book I didn't care for, but still a Coulter fan."
3,Disappointed,"As a big fan of the Savich and Sherlock series, I was disappointed by this newest installment. I didn't like the addition of the supernatural elements AT ALL. I did like the characters of Savich's sister, Lily, and Simon Russo, and they added a new romance to the ongoing story. If you follow the series, you will most likely read this one anyway, but it just doesn't live up to it's predecessors."
1,Editing anyone?,"I feel like something happened to Catherine Coulter before the last two mystery novels she wrote. I've always enjoyed her work, but it's as if she's trying out a style of writing that is at complete odds with the material. Or, because of her success, no one is editing her, or having the guts to tell her the writing has taken a severe downswing. Why? To meet deadlines? I wish more time had been taken to review her manuscript before publication."
1,Pass the hemlock!,"Precisely who wrote this dialogue? Was Ms. Coulter out of her ever-lovin' mind? Character development was, essentially, non-existent; banal is the first word to describe this. Had to get a title out on time; too busy? Where on earth was the editor on this one?"
2,Not up to her previous work,"Hemlock Bay is not up to Catherine Coulter's previous Sherlock and Savich novels. The plot is contrived and not realistic. While the action is adequate, the romance is lacking. Re-read ""Riptide"" and wait for the next book in the series. The Sherlock and Savich characters are worth waiting for."
3,downhill,I was a great fan - to me the books have been going downhill. As soon as she added mediums and spooks I started to lose interest.
5,Sherlock and Savich are back!!,"I have loved every one of the books in this series, as well as Catherine's other novels. She is able to mix suspense, humor, horror, and everyday drama into a page turning book. I sat down at 10pm and didn't put the book down until I finished it. The book proved to be better than sleep! Great read!"
1,Deceptive description - No PCMCIA card included,"This is a completely deceptive listing. What is being sold is an antenna, not a working PCMCIA cellular card."
1,Don't buy this it's only the antenna,Do not Buy this if you are looking for the PC Card this is only the Antenna for the Aircard. What you see in the picture is what you get. The guy above is smoking something if he thinks you can buy this and get a $300 pccard
1,Autobiography vs. biography,"Because of Russell's political views (his opposition to war and U.S. imperialism) he has always been the subject of attacks by other intellectuals (the late Sidney Hook is a prime example). One only has to compare Monk's work on Russell to his biography of Wittgenstein (""The Duty of Genius"" says it all). The interesting thing about each of Monk's biographies is that while both men led solitary lives and maintained erratic beliefs and behavior, Russell is castigated as a ""madman"" while Wittgenstein is a ""genius."" It is far too easy as a biographer to portray intellectual celebrities as either geniuses or madman. If you want to hear from the person, Bertie Russell, read his biography instead."
5,Dependable,It withstood the humidity in the Philippines. Never it failed to dry my hair while I was there. I did not have to squeeze it in my small suitcase because it folds and it takes 110 and 220 voltage. My friend's hair dryer failed while we were in this country but this one did not. She had to borrow mine and was used by her four girls after she did. It will be travelling with me again this coming Febuary to another tropical country.

2,"Hey provider, you've sent me the wrong fragrance!","You've sent me the pink one, when I stated that I want the purple one.Never had time to send it back, but not a good precedent."
2,perfume,"everything was fine with the way it was delivered, but the scent of this perfume is not very good.i thought it would be a really good scent like the regular Fantasy, but this is no where near being half as good.i wouldn't recommend buying it online if you've never smelled it before."
5,AMAZING,"I'm a perfume addict. I've worn D&G light blue, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears Curious & Fantasy, Juicy Couture, Vera Wang Princess, DKNY Be Delicious, and this is the BEST perfume. It's my favorite way to start the day, and I never get sick of the scent (I've been wearing it for about a year and 1/2 now). Midnight Fantasy has a much more fruity tone than the regular Fantasy (along the lines of grape, cherries, vanilla + cotton candy). It's the more grown up, more sensual version of the cotton candy Fantasy scent. It doesn't last all day, which can be a plus or minus, BUT the Midnight Fantasy lotion is awesome, and does last all day. This is an original scent that not a lot of people have...and guys LOOOVE it. Buy!"
4,What vampires?,"Well, the title got me to buy the book, shame on me for falling for it. It's a good read, but the subject matter is serial killers, not vampires; not even so-called ""historical vampires"", and sometimes the serial killers don't even have a vampiric element to their crimes at all! The author attempts to imply that there's some sort of ""dracula syndrome"" but there's very little case for this. He doesn't even bother trying, I thought. I gave it 4 stars because even though it has little to do with the matter the title implies, it's still pretty interesting."
2,Poozies without Kate Rusby,"This is the Poozies post Kate Rusby.I was disappointed because I was hoping to hear a new CD by Kate Rusby. The Poozies prior and after to Kate Rusby are not as universally appealing. There are a few nice songs and it is user friendly music if you like the style, which includes a few instrumentals, but definately nothing special like you would expect if Kate Rusby were singing."
3,Very Good BUT....,"I ordered this blade to use on an inexpensive tile saw thinking it would cut better than the one supplied, that was wearing out. It works well, but on hard ceramic tile, the flat, forward edge chipped the tile almost as much as my worn out blade. On soft ceramic tile it worked file. Overall it did the job, but I expected more given the manufacturer and the price. Home Depot sells this blade as an upgrade for their regular 7"" saw blade so maybe my expectations were too high. Next time I'll try the Felkars 7"" blade, which runs about the same money."
1,Not what it was cracked up to be,"The book was in horrible condition! Extremely worn cover, bent torn pages throughout, and writing all through as well. plus, there was no CD as was advertised. I would never use this seller again."
5,A MUST SEE TV EVENT!!!,"Every citizen of the USA must see this documentary to understand what our real heroes MUST ENDURE. Every @#$%& politician MUST receive one as a gift when confronted in voting for a bill in benefit of our soldiers. Because this type of wounds are the MOST HARD TO CURE, IF THERE'S ANY!!! A masterpiece. Thanks to James Gandolfini for this tribute TO OUR REAL HEROES!!! PSTD IS NOT A SYNONYM FOR WEAKNESS!!!"
1,SHEER TORTURE---,"I cannot do it justice, explaining how bad this book was. The storyline was so AWFUL it would make the worst Harlequin romance look like great literature. The ""heroine"" was an embarrassingly spineless clueless wuss, when she wasn't being an ear-splitting shrew. The ""hero"" had a beyond-teeth-grinding split personality: one was scarily obsessed with the heroine's body (and only her body) and the other was cold, insensitive, and ruthless. He used both of his personalities to constantly boss her around and she would just meekly obey. Ugh! Also, the narrator was ALL wrong. He gave the heroine a masculine voice which was disconcerting enough, but his narrative was done in such a sober and staid tone that he sounded like he should be announcing the great composers on National Public Radio."
2,I have not received the book I wanted,"The title of the book was referring to the newest edition, but what I received was an old edition. So unfortunatelly I have not received what I expected. So I am dissatisfied with the service.Old edition title: The Pyramid PrincipleNew edition: The Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing...."
1,This book is greatly overpriced and the content is poor.,This book was touted as the book to buy on writing and organizing reports. It is greatly overpriced at $67.50. You don't get much for your money. It is about 170 pages of low quality paper with large type. I think whoever is touting this book must have been paid by the author. I expected a quality piece of publishing and got cheap junk. The contents aside they could have at least made it look good.
2,Great Concepts - Terrible Book,"The concepts the book presents are very powerful and clearly very useful for readers who want to learn about how to structure their thinking and communications.However, the book itself is quite poorly written, which is surprising for an author who is considered to be a communication expert. Examples are quite antiquated and dry, and not all concepts are explained sufficiently enough. At a $70+ price, I cannot recommend this book and would suggest you consider alternatives."
5,Immediately improve your communication skills,"This book will improve your effectiveness as a communicator. You will be more persuasive. You will be more clear. You will spend less time writing to achieve these goals.The book tells you how to structure your writing. It provides concrete, clear tests to apply to all communications that you can apply immediateley. The book focuses on business activity, but you can apply the principles everywhere.The best book on writing I've every read, eclipsing ""The Elements of Style"". Highly recommended."
5,This is essential,"Minto's pyramid principle is essential for good writing - it's helped me out enourmously. Easily written book that you can read in full, or just focus on the main chapters."
4,Great information - price way too high,The information provided in this book is wonderful for anyone having to do serious presentations and problem solving. It is dryly presented but worth putting into practice. The reason I didn't give it a 10 is the price
2,"A tough, dry read",I'm a pretty avid reader of business books but I haven't made it through the first chapter of this one.
5,A Higher Level of Business Communication,"Barbara Minto has developed a revolutionary method of logical thinking, organization and communication of information. It takes proposals and presentations to a higher level of intellectal rigor and business communication. The precision and conciseness engendered by The Minto Principle is particularly effective for top management presentations. As a former Chairman of the Board of the American Management Association, I have encountered a number of top executives for whom this system made a significant difference. The careful reading and perserverance required by the Minto Principle creates a chain of logic that enhances the value of your ideas and allows you to think and communicate in a completely new way."
5,Getting to the heart of the matter,"I've used this book again and again and it never fails to yield up some new insight. It's simply the best book in its field. It's particularly good, of course, on structure; it gives you a way in to virtually every business communication. It has a very stringent rationale and fairly tough samples to go with it. Toward the end it mentions 'images' - I'd like this aspect of business writing to be dealt with in far greater depth. I haven't yet seen the 1996 edition, but I'll try to get a copy."
4,Easy to install,"This product was easy to install. I haven't noticed any significant difference in the way my engine runs and there has been no change to my gas milage. It will need to be cleaned at 50000 miles, and you have to order special stuff from K&N to do the cleaning."
4,"Better than I expected, but definately a neophytes book","I was only expecting a biographical background of Franz Bardon to fill in some blanks and that itself was only a 2 star read; very light on content. The other 2 stars were for the 3rd section, for beginners in FB's work the third section turns out to be a gem in the rough. It really adds flavor to your self-directed learning/practice of Bardon's magic."
2,Not Great Print Quality,I would go for the Arcanum version of this film as the print quality is better and it's paired in a double feature with Tod Slaughter's MURDER IN THE RED BARN. A MUCH better value.
5,Easy to use and FUN!,"I recently learned a basic knitting stitch from my sister in-law, but it was becoming increasingly boring - I wanted to learn how to do more! I had looked through several ""how to knit"" type books and they were all confusing and full of terms that a non-knitter like myself has no way of knowing. On one of my quests to find a knitting book I could use, I stumbled across Stich 'N Bitch. Hey with a title like that, who wouldn't at lease skim through it??! I bought it, and began reading it right away.Not only does this book have some neat facts/stories about knitting, it also is easy to use, providing layman's definitions for all of those counfusing knitting terms. It lays the groundwork for future knitting projects, and has patterns that even a beginner can use (and look like a pro!). This is definately the best book available for the beginning knitter."
2,"Clever copy, little use","I enjoyed reading this book but was dispappointed with its content for the most part. The copy is clever and witty but if you want humor try reading another book. The patterns were esoteric and I was not inspired to knit any of them, often I said to myself why would anyone want to knit that? I mean who wears wrist wraps and sweaters with skulls on them? There are lots of other books that have more information and better paterns and instructions."
5,The best knitting book to learn from,"I had always wanted to learn to knit, but every book or video I picked up did not help. That is until Deb Stoller arrived on the scene. Her instructions a very clear and concise with a dash of good humor. This is the book that finally taught me and can teach you. Enjoy!"
3,"My mistake, not theirs.","This book does not really fit my needs, but it is my fault, not the seller's. I should have paid more attention to the content. The patterns are quite contemporary, and would be very nice for a younger knitter. I'll find someone to pass it on to. The book itself is interesting and well done, just not to my taste."
5,Easy to follow steps & directions. Love it,I have never been able to learn anything new from a book until I got this book. I can't believe how easy and clear it is. The pictures are great and I would highly recommend this book.
4,Good starter book,"Debbie makes knitting accessible with good instruction and nice patterns. Even more experienced knitters will find patterns here that won't bore them. This is aimed at a younger crowd (sweater with skulls on it, adult sized hat with cat ears) so would make a great gift for a teen or 20-something knitter."
5,great tips for knitters,"I love the tips for knitters, some that have not seen before, and i love the clear, explicit way that things are explained! I have been knitting for years, but have never run across some of this advice."
3,Good 'n Bad,"Stitch 'n Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook is one of the books I picked up to teach myself how to knit. Unfortunately, there are only a few things that aren't covered in better detail by the other product I purchased,The Chicks with Sticks Guide to Knitting: Learn to Knit with more than 30 Cool, Easy Patterns. Since the pictures are in grayscale, with the exception of the main color yarn, it was hard for me to figure out what the directions for stitches were supposed to look like as I was stitching them. I also appreciate that Stitch 'n Bitch covered how to read a chart, albeit in not as detailed a manner as I'd have liked.While Chicks with Sticks was more able to help me learn to knit, and has more patterns I would like to create, I will use Stitch 'n Bitch as an additional resource to figure out how to achieve some of the more complicated stitches."
4,Both entertaining and informative,"I'm learning to knit and used this book to master the basic moves. Debbie's style is funny, witty, and made me laugh. There were only 2 issues I have with this book: (1) There needs to be more explanation about knitting in the round--had to get help elsewhere on that. (2) Many projects use very expensive yarn, which is not practical for beginners. We beginners need to start with Red Heart Super Saver yarn until we get better, not spend $150 on just yarn when a sweater is out of our reach. Other than that, it's a great book and well worth the money."
3,"Good, but....","So I started out not knowing anything about knitting. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. I started reading and thought ""this doesn't look so hard"" I followed all the directions (which were sometimes vague)and started knitting my first row, then I got to the second...that's when I stared at frustration at the tangled mess of my needles. So I undid it and started again and again and again, this went on for a while until my lovely husband says to me, ""Why don't you just youtube it?"". To be honest the video I watched on youtube made much more sense than the techniques in Stoller's book. I think that the book has some interesting ideas and once you get the general idea of how to freakin' knit, then you can figure out the cool stitch's she has to offer. So the final verdict is, get it, but supplement with youtube otherwise you may end really unhappy with that awesome shiny yarn and needles you just bought.P.S. As a personal tip, I found a 6mm needle and chunkier yarn to be easier to start with."
4,"I enjoyed it, but learned little","This book is very fun to read, but, maybe I'm just a more visual learner than others, because I've had to find online sources to learn the techniques in the book because I had no idea what she was saying. I've learned most of the techniques in the book from knittinghelp.com, not the book. As for the patterns, I've yet to make one. I love the skull and crossbones sweater though. Many people love the alein illusion scarf. But I've also heard the patterns are sometimes very amaturely written and are hard to size and such because of. And while there seem to be some awesome patterns, I don't think I'd recommend the book based on the patterns alone."
5,the best knitting money you can spend!,"i picked this book up to re-learn knitting properly. I love that you can refer to a technique or tip quickly and find most sentences start with - this is easy!! gotta love that :)i recommend this book to any newbie learning to knit, or knitter needing a laugh and some truly hip patterns that are REALLY wearable/useable!!I can't wait til Ms. Stoller's next book comes out!"
5,"fun, easy, practical knitting",I love the idea of this book and I love the practical suggestions and patterns it contains. I look forward to a lot of knitting.
5,Awesome Book,Ordered the book and received in just a couple days. The book was in great shape and I am enjoying reading it. It is written so anyone can understand. I am looking forward to making the project in this book and learning more about knitting.
3,Good for the beginning knitter,"Some of the patterns are a little outdated now, but the instructional portion of the book is wonderful. It's perfect for a beginning knitter, and I think it's a must have for any knitting library."
4,Good overview for beginners,"No, this is not the most in-depth book you can find. But I'm a beginning knitter and am teaching myself to knit from this book, and so far I haven't had any problems.It's hard to rate a guide book, because every one's learning style is different. What works for one person may not work for another. Certainly, there may be better books out there for teaching beginners, but for an overview of knitting, including a bit of history, knitting in pop culture, as well as how-to and patterns (all with a hipster vibe), this book succeeds.As for the book not living up to the hype, well, I can almost guarantee you that nothing ever lives up to its hype. Browse through this book before you buy (if possible) to see if it's for you. And if not... well, there doesn't seem to be any lack of knitting books out there."
2,Don't believe the hype!!!,"This book is super hyped and long on style, short on substance. I have been knitting for over a decade and the patterns in this book are poorly planned and described, and require hunting through the internet for corrections due to the fact that they were not checked before printing (!). I think the explanations are convoluted and not good for the visual learner--i have talked to many beginners that had problems with it. I would suggest the Knitter's Bible instead for basic instructions and a fantastic stitch glossary. It has visual steps and very thorough explanations. For patterns, I recommend ""knitwit"" and ""hip to knit"" for SUPER cute patterns that are well-explained and turn out beautifully."
4,"A little of this, a little of that","I attended a knitting convention in Oakland last weekend. Came home with too much wool, lots of ideas, and this dandy little sassy knitting book. There is the usual basis information, of course, but it's author Stoller's breezy discussions about the ancient art of knitting, its history, family photos - all sorts of stuff you're highly unlikely to find in any other knitting book. How to start your own knitting group, website information. Oddball projects, too: purses and backpacks.I knitted up a storm about 40 yrs ago when I was in college. Then I went cold turkey and didn't pick up a pair of knitting needles until about a year ago. So I don't know whether I'm a beginner or what - but whatever: I found this book helpful, engaging, just delightful."
5,Good for beginners!,"This is a great book! As with all knitting books (at least for me) it's good to at least know the basics before cracking this book open. I had a friend show me how she casts on, knits and purls. Then I referred to this book and adapted the Old English style. But if you're great at learning just by description and pictures, then get started!The author is funny, keeps it simple, and is fun. This book makes knitting less fuddy duddy and more hip and funky."
3,Not perfect by any means,"Let me preface by saying that this book did teach me to knit. It can teach you to knit, too. But it is not perfect by any means and may not be the best book to learn from.I often found myself frustrated by the instructions and wondering what in G-d's name to do next. Oftentimes, when I could not figure out a technique from the book, it took thinking for myself and a little common sense to get through it.And call me a snob, but I found the patterns a little corny. I prefer a little more classic mixed in with my cool. (at age 21, I have long lost the desire to sport a backpack with a monkey on it- although it could make a cute gift)There is plenty good in this book, and it is actually laugh-out-loud funny, and heck, I've learned everything I know from it (I've only been knitting for 2 weeks). But it could use a little more substance over style and the instructions are not as clear as they could be..."
2,Clever copy but a waste of money,"I thought this book would be great judging by the title but as the saying goes, you can't judge a book by its cover. If I had been in a traditional store where I could look through it, I wouldn't have purchased it. It is more fluff than content using cleverly written copy, overly snappy layout, and all the knitting puns out there but it doesn't fill a void in the knitting book world. The projects aren't interesting, I was not inspired to make a single one and for several I nearly laughed out loud at how ridiculous they were, do people really need wrist warmers or a sweater with a skull on it? My advice: Don't bother with this book. If your a beginer knitter then the Vogue Knitting guide is the comprehensive tome that every knitter needs, and the Yarn Girls guide is full of quick and easy beginer projects to get you started. Happy Knitting"
4,Great Beginner's How To!,"This book is a great one to pick up if you are a beginner and are looking to get started, or are already familiar with some knitting basics and are hoping to advance the complexity of your knitting projects. Learn how to fix common knitting mistakes and try out some cute patterns."
4,Great for new knitters,"I learned how to knit through the instructions in this book, and have been knitting for about 9 months now. I am completely obsessed and just can't seem to put down my needles! I think this book presents knitting in a very non-threatening way, because I had attempted knitting before and failed miserably, but with these instructions I just picked it up super easily. I've knitted a few of the patterns in this book, and intend to knit others, but I've found the instruction portion of the book to be more valuable than the patterns so far."
1,Disappointment,"I learned how to crochet by using Stoller's other book, Stitch n' Bitch Crochet, which was clear and easy to use. However, her knitting book is an absolute travesty. The instructions are either wrong or badly written, but whatever they are, I was forced to buy another [...] book just to learn basic stitches.Additionally, the projects require expensive yarn that isn't even available in my state. It would cost me [...] just to buy and ship the yarn I would need to make the pair of socks in the book.Much of the writing is purely fluff, which can be annoying when you have to read three paragraphs in order to get one sentence of content. ""The Importance of Needle Width,"" for example, on page 25, could be condensed into a few sentences. Just tell me that I need a needle gauge, for Christ's sake!In conclusion, you'll love this book if you have plenty of time and money."
5,First timer,"I have tried to knit before to no avail, and with the help of this book, I just completed my first row of succesful knitted fabric! I already knew how to crochet, so I had some experience with yarn and hooks, but I could never get the hang of knitting with two sticks sans hook. This book has the best written instructions I have ever seen. I am so pleased with this purchase! THANK YOU, DEBBIE!P.S. I can't wait to make ""skully!"""
3,A Beginner's Perspective,"This book is great for teaching basic skills--the instructional section is detailed and fun to read. It actually has some of the best beginner instructions of any book I've tried (and I went through a lot of them because I had no one to show me even the basics). It's also great at capturing the hipness and fun of the knitting revival.My only reservation is the patterns. I feel they jump from the beginner's scarf to intermediate stuff with very little in between. There's not a lot for the true beginner to practice on to gain the confidence to tackle some of the more advanced projects. As far as the selection of patterns, about half are cool, edgy stuff that I would love to try, and the other half look way too homemade. I would give it 3 1/2 stars: very glad I tried it, but also glad I didn't buy it. (However, there is a glorious poncho in there that I vow to make some day!)"
2,"Good for beginners, or collecting dust on my shelves","I bought this book after reading all the stellar reviews posted here. As a fairly new knitter, I learned just about a year before I purchased this, I thought I could pick up some good information from this. Maybe my skills are more advanced than I thought, because this seemed too basic. None of the projects really jumped out and said, ""Knit ME!"" Some where for a much younger crowd, (I just turned 30 this year, so I'm not quite a grandma yet!), and were not at all what I was expecting.I have since lent it out to a younger cousin who is just beginning to knit, and is full of questions. Hopefully she'll get my money's worth out of this book, as I surely didn't."
5,more than cute patterns,"I was somewhat horrified by my interest in (and love of) knitting, as a first in a few generations knitter in my early twenties. My mom saw knitting as a throwback to unglorious days. This book helps to clear things up a bit.Through personal essay and observation, Debbie Stoller manages to clarify the pull knitting is having on young women (in this latest wave of new knitters) as well as to reclaim knitting from its unflattering stereotype.When I finished reading, I passed the book on to Mom, who now knits."
3,Learning how to,"I enjoy this book, but it wasn't the best at explaining and showing pictures on how to start knitting. I had to look at videos on the internet to learn how to start. But other than that it was worth it."
4,"It's a classic, but there's other resources","This book is decent for the beginning knitter, and maybe not so necessary for anyone else. It has a lot of good information describing the appearance of knit stitches vs. purl stitches, knitting lingo, fixing mistakes, starting your own knitting group, etc. Depending on how visual of a learner you are, you might want something with more step-by-step photos. Or maybe even some knitting videos online. There's plenty of resources out there, ""Stitch 'n Bitch"" is just one of many."
3,Get Pam Allen's book first...,"... and here's why. Yes, this book is cute (in fact, a little too cutesy in spots) and it has the best beginner patterns - things you'll really want to wear. But it also has some questionable advice - for example, the first thing I turned to was a recommendation to forget blocking your work before you assemble it. Dumb. Very, very dumb. That's like not washing fabric before you sew it - you may get away with it sometimes, but not often, and it's a sloppy habit.I'd buy this book in conjunction with the ""Dummies"" guide, if you can afford both. Otherwise, start with Pam Allen and add this one next."
1,This book insults all knitters,"If you are an experienced knitter, pass this one by. You will be insulted and offended. Ms. Stoller acts as if she singlhandedly saved knitting and gathering women together to do so from antiquity. She makes it clear that only those who choose the most exotic and expensive yarns and needles are wothy of her lofty tome. If you dare to be so crass as to use aluminum needles, prepare to be insulted. The patterns in this book are the of the most basic and unimatinative variety. She gives you the instructions for a simple scarf as if she was the first person to ever knit a long rectangle in garter.If you are a new knitter, you will be better served by absolutely any other book on the market. This woman will confuse you with her attempts to give instructions in what I assume she thinks are hip and trendy terms."
2,"Cute, but annoying","She's amusing. The patterns are very young and very thin. Don't buy this if you wear a size 10 or more. It made me chuckle a time or two, but the femenist mentality comes through way too much. The patterns are do-able for almost any knitter, but definately aimed at the 18-24 crowd. Although I'm still in that crowd, I'd pass on this given the chance again."
2,LEFTIES: Don't Be Fooled!,"I made the mistake of reading a review below citing the book's inclusion of ""The Continental Method"" as being ""for lefties."" It's not! Not if you are a Lefty who wants the SAME EASE, AGILITY AND SOOTHING USE OF YOUR LEFT HAND .... in the way RIGHT handed knitters take for granted. If you want your LEFT hand to be the ACTIVE hand... the HAND WIELDING THE NEEDLE, forget this book and keep trying to find a left near you who will just show you."
4,Nice Book,Nice book but wish more stylish yarn was used like in the Julie Carles book. STill this is good for the beginning knitter and it is very personalized and explains more than you want to know about yarn and knitting.
5,"great for beginners, and fun for old hands too","This book was what helped me get to the next level with my knitting. It's simple and easy to understand, with a lot of helpful visuals and a fresh take on techniques. Plus, the patterns are ones that younger knitters will have fun with!"
4,Knitter's Handbook review,"I liked this book overall. I like Debbie Stoller and I think she is a great crafter & I like the 'punny' subtitles she uses. After having purchased the crochet version of this book first, I was expecting more color photos than there actually were, but overall I would recommend this book to other new knitters."
5,My Go-To Guide for Knitting,"By far, this is the best book for a newbie knitter to learn knitting basics. Stoller's directions and pictures make sense for someone who is learning as they go. I've been knitting for a year and a half, and I often refer to this guide when learning a new technique. If you can't figure out where a topic is in the table of contents, the index is really good. There are beginner projects in here for a variety of tastes. I would like to see Stolller release an updated version as trends change and some of the resources she cites are no longer available. But still a really great knitting guide that has taught the joy of this craft for many new knitters."
5,You need this one.,"This book is an in-house expert available at all times. I've used it as a beginner for the basic stuff and now refer to it for help with more complex stitches. The patterns are not what I would choose to pour time into, but that hardly matters; the author encourages one to go for personal design and to find unique ways of doing things."
1,"Boring and Dull patterns, muddy instructions. Total waste of cash.","What a waste of paper this book is. The first half is just her droning on and on about the history of knitting, her family history of knitting, her grandmother's death bed, and a bunch of other useless anticdotes and her trying to talk 'hipster'...yawn. The instructions in this book are muddy at best.The second half is the patterns which are seriously boring and out of date (think mid-90s, Brooklyn hipster). Anyone can knit a boxy sweater and no one looks good in one. What's the point. This book is 100% filler and if I really stretch it, one half way decent pattern among all the sillyness and uselessness. There are way too many good books out there with clear instructions (hers are like mud) and fabulous patterns to waste time and money on this one."
2,Enough with the Bad Attitude,"Why is our society sunk so low that even a knitting book has to be full of bad attitude in order to promote this time honored and beautiful craft? I looked at the book on the shelf and decided not to buy it because it had no place in my home. I agree that it could encourage a beginner to get some knitting done, but why can't we do that with some decorum?(I'm a relatively young mother of small children and not a grandmother.)"
3,The title prevents me from buying this book...,"I just can't get past the title of this book. From the reviews, it looks like an excellent resource, but I just can't have a book with a title like that in my house with kids. Sorry. What a shame!"
4,THE Knitting Book,"I've been knitting on and off for about 5 years, not including the various times my mom tried to teach me. I love to look at knitting patterns and wish I could knit more than just a scarf. This book has been a great help so far. I'm comfortable with the common ""knit & purl"" techniques but anything after that, I get a little intimidated. This book breaks it down and shows you, with illustrations, just how to make those tricky stitches. With other patterns I've seen they have a difficulty scale and that's my only complaint with this book. I'd like to knit a few of the sweaters in the book but I don't know if I'd be way over my head or not. Other than that, I think it's a great book for anyone who is interested in learning to knit or even current knitters looking for some new, funky patterns. It would make a great gift!"
3,good value,"Even though this book was used, it came to me in very good condition.The book is an older book but still has great written instructions along with little pieces of information one can learn from."
3,Good resource for beginners,"After checking a few books out of the library, this was the first knitting book I purchased. Although, I ended up consulting youtube and a DVD before I mastered the basic stitches, this is an excellent resource. It's light, fun and full of great tips. I purchased another book off her book list, and visited a yarn store from her list while in NY on business, and hit a home run (helpful Italian grandma took me under her wing--I'll be back for lessons when in I'm in the city!) Thanks for making it fun, Debbie!I'm currently working on the ribbed scarf."
3,"Great patterns, unhelpful directions for a new knitter","As someone just learning to knit, I found the directions and illustrations for how to do the basics lacking. For example, there is only 1 picture for a four-step process, and the instructions are missing details such as which way to wrap the yarn around the needle. I've found much clearer directions for beginners elsewhere. But the patterns are really fun and modern. I decided to keep the book just for the patterns."
3,Satisfying dessert flavor,This coffee was a good dessert flavor and provided enough flavor to make it a stand alone dessert item for a hearty meal.
3,"This is ""Gaye"".","Well on the plus side, this has a number of his hits, and is almost a live hits album. It's also pretty lengthy at around 70 minutes, with an 11 minute ""Sexual Healing"". But the recording is kind of poor, and almost sounds like a bootleg. It's not terrible, but I suspect another live album might sound better. However, it is ""Marvin"", and it's hard to complain about that."
1,Heidegger's Children,"Wolin appears to be a decent philospher and researcher, buthe needs to learn how to write. Herky jerky style and skewed syntax make this one an almost impossible read. Sorry folks, butI have to rate this one as unintelligable garble."
5,Base for Art and Culture class - lower grade levels especially,"Helpful book, well organized - I actually have the original publication, but appreciate all the updates. I am an art teacher who is using this to create an Art and Culture class at the high school level"
1,"Grown-up crafter, very disappointed","Waaaaaaay less than I expected as an adult world-traveled crafter. After reading the blurbs,I expected much more than the cheesy, substitute products given as the starting ingredients of these crafts. Obviously a book for elementary school teachers, working on a budget, NOT a way to re-create crafts from round the world. I can't believe that these projects would satisfy even young crafters who had seen pictures of ""the real thing""."
5,"Informative,interesting,absorbing,engrossing.........","This book was ""out of this world"".My dream is to sit down with MARY and ask away.......Now thats not quite possible as we dont know one another and we are both busy people.Not to fear though!Mary must have forseen her readers unquenchable thirst for wisdom,and in this book she ""pours the water""Open up folks""!Im very sure most people will love this book.Again Mary uses the question and answer format.(my favorite)the questions from readers are basically interesting as are Marys responces.A must read......so much to ponder over,think about.Then you will re-read.Over and over.I tell everyone i know about Mary's books.All of them.This one,though has become my favorite!"
1,Not Good,"I ordered this based on what the flavor was, but i got it and ground the beans and it didn't smell or taste anything like what the flavor says it should. Will not order it again"
2,Sized incorrectly,The costume is fine with the exception of the size is completely incorrect. It was small enough to fit a toddler when it was a 8-10 child size.
3,Could be better,"My daughter wanted this for under her ""Hulk"" suit. Overall it just squished flat. Would be fine as shown but didn't add much under another layer except wrinkles"
3,"Look at me, I'm the Hulk","My nephew just loves this shirt. He thinks he is big like the ""Hulk"" Wants everyone to feel his muscles."
4,worth it,Good for the price. only issue was the back merely velcros closed. This was slightly annoying because it ended up being baggier than anticpated.
5,Kids Muscle Shirt,This worked great as a Halloween costume. Easy to put on and comfortable to wear. My son really loved it.
4,A 3 year old's He-man halloween,I purchased this for a friends son who wants to be He-man for halloween but unfortunately this costume isn't made for kids/toddlers so this is going to be used as part of the He-man costume being made by his mom. She sent me pics of her son wearing this and it was a perfect fit being that her son is tall and strong for his age. Both of them luv it!
5,Wonderful Insight,"I have read quite a few books on meditation, but this one has actually helped me to dig a little deeper past western thought, to understand the nature and philosophies of buddhism. I tore through this book- even missed a subway stop because I couldn't stop reading in the middle of the section on karma (go figure).In addition, I'm actually learning to be mindful - to see things differently. This book is, as its title suggests, insightful. Moreover, it is wonderful, in the true sense of wonder."
4,"Good, but not the best book for beginning meditators","The best book for beginners that I have seen is ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana. This is a good follow-up book that goes a little deeper into many of the concepts of insight meditation. It has very short sections that are very readable. It's not a ""how to"" book. It's a ""what does it mean"" book."
5,A Must Read,"I borrowed this book from a friend a few years ago, the first book I read on the topic of mindfulness, and it is still perhaps my favorite. Goldstein writes in a very easy to understand language while still incorporating Pali terms. He mixes traditional teachings with his personal experience in such a way that really helps to convey the message more effectively. This is an excellent book for those newly interested in meditation and Buddhism but is also a valuable read for those with more experience too."
4,Great product but you will need extras,"Ok where do i begin.....Its a great bike rack, sturdy, strong and well built. Now the flaw and expense its about $70 for the rack, then you will need a hitch with a ball either 1/4 for explorers or a 1/4 with adapter for other trucks. then the hitch - $ 20 comes with a pin for which is useless if you leave the bikes unattended.So you would need to buy a master locking pin from home depot for $20 for the hitch on the truck. Then comes the cross bar for woman's bikes that they recommend -- I totally recommend this because it keeps the bike straight like the mans instead of it being on an angle.. then if your traveling you will need a tarp or bike cover so the highway debris wont interfere during a rain storm nether the less the water that will wet the bikes. OK tally $ 140 total But over all the swag-man has a lock on top so If you buy the master locking hitch pin your totally protected from bike theft."
3,Ingredients Don't Meld,"There are some recipes in this book that I make over and over, such as the Portuguese Stew with Turkey Sausage and the Pork with Prunes and Apple Brandy, which gets raves from guests. But there are far more recipes that produce bland stews than there are recipes that produce outstanding savory stews. This book is worth buying if you can get it at a low price."
4,Great for on the go use,"Lightweight and perfect for taking with me on mountain bike rides to cut any downed trees or branches. Fits nicely into my Camelbak. I can use it with two hands or one. The blade is very sharp and cuts easily through branches. I've used it on up to maybe a 9"" tree that had fallen. It's not exactly made for cutting large branches, but using the three-cut method gets the job done. The blade seems to be made out of some cheap metal, but it works.Amazon's item weight is off. Here's the actual specs.Weight: 6.5oz (184 grams)Folded length: 9""Open length: 15"""
3,Not motivating enough to keep you going....,"I purchased the set as a way to work out at home and avoid going to the gym. My experience with Tae Bo was limited, I'll admit, but I have attended many fitness classes and have a feel for what they should include. Billy's fitness video was like watching a work out class...and like a work out class I only did it a few times. The Amped Bar that was included as a bonus was a joke and doesn't stay together. Additionally, the videos are all different lengths and the ""workout plan"" that comes with the videos was disappointing at best. I won't be wasting my money on Billy again."
5,Great workouts,All good. Billy Blanks workouts are what you make of them and he try to encourage you as you go. You have to do the work. It won't work unless you do it. Simple as that.
5,review,Awesome! LOVE IT! Great workouts. Many to choose from. And many different levels of intensity. Billy keeps you motivated. Great way to have fun while you get fit. Fast paced and upbeat helps the time go by fast while you challenge yourself.
2,Just what the name says - A pocket refernce,Useful - but I would say costs too much for its content.Anyone can make their own reference book similar to or better than this using TOAD's Help features!
1,Outdated -- do not buy,"This book was written for version 8.5 of Toad way back in 2005. Since then a lot has changed and frankly I don't think this book is relevant anymore. I work with v 11 of Toad now and it's more useful to go online for help, Quest actually has a lot of documentation available so I wouldn't waste your time on this book until they come out with an updated 3rd edition."
4,about conscience and orders,"Absorbing morality tale, conscience catching up with Paul Damion in a moment of truth. His counterpart, a woman with no conscience but overweening power, behaves as expected. Dibner is good at making his readers yearn for comeuppance, or else. I would have torn up the book had he not delivered. The story isn't set much at sea so the cover is misleading. Yet I believed in Dibner and got the book. No disappointments."
3,a bit dissapointing,"This collection was not quite as great as i was hoping. the poems were nice to have, most aren't in the complete tales and poems. i especially like the lines on ale. the letters were truly a gem to read. it gave a nice view of poe's thoughts and a hint of his wit. the selection from poe's marginalia gave a wonderful insight to his mind. but the essays by the french were dull and really didn't give any new information, other than his worship by the french. i recommend this collection only for the poe enthusiast (like me)."
2,Less then full,"I have ordered this and other products like it from various retailers before. This one was not as full as it should have been. The bottle was only 75% full, I will not order from that merchant again...."
1,A waste of money,"I waited over a year for this book to be published in the United States. When it arrived I was shocked to see that the measurements in the recipes are in grams, litres and celsius. If I had wanted this I could have ordered the book from Amazon UK.In addition the book bills itself as being a macrobiotic cookbook yet it contains both tomatoes and peppers, both of which are not eaten on a macrobiotic diet.The book is a piece of useless fluff."
2,Rather Outdated,"The book is a decent read for those who aren't familiar with online marketing at all, but if the reader has any experience, they will find this to be a waste of their time.Most of the examples used in the book seem like they were pulled out of 1999. Most online consumers are sick on marketing filling up their email inboxes. Even those that the customer originally expressed interest in become a chore.At this point in time, Blogs and RSS feeds should be a new focus of online marketing.If you are interested in email marketing, I recommend Permission Marketing by Seth Godin instead -- his work is excellent."
5,Excellent Insight into Retention Marketing,Hans Peter's insight into the next wave of Internet Marketing is a must read for all Corporate and Consulting Marketeers. Beyond Permission Marketing and Email Marketing comes 'Eng@ged Customer Marketing'.
5,Its Great,"Its nice to see a book out that shows and tells the stories of plus size women, the pictures are the best, they show the womens true beauty. It also talks about the pressure put on men in society to date and marry that size 6 woman. I think women will like it for the fact that there are men out there that like them for how they are and not the way society claims they should be."
3,"Good concept, poor writing","Mayer has some interesting things to say on the subject, but unfortunately, this book is just not that well written. It's biggest flaw is that it strays far off topic and stays there for extended periods. A better subtitle would be ""One Man's Rambling Rantings About Society with Occasional Praise of Large Women.""The Fat Girl's Guide to Life by Wendy Shanker is a much better read."
3,Odd but interesting,"I had been looking forward to finally reading something written by a man who is an unabashed FA. There were some places in the book where I thought Aha; and there were some places where I was just scratching my head, confused.Since there are few men who will admit without shame that they are attracted to fat women, I have to give Mayer points for making his opinion known, especially in our thin-obsessed society."
5,"Amazing, powerful, inspiring story","This is one of the most powerful books I've ever read. At first you react with shock, then disbelief, tears, and finally joy as you ride with Victor on his incredible journey. The story is unbelievably compelling - I couldn't put the book down, though some events were so difficult to read about, I wanted to. Victor's father is more than a match for any terrible fathers in past books -- THE GREAT SANTINI, for instance. But what's really amazing, and really moving, is how Victor triumphed over the odds, with the help of his ""angels,"" to become not only a good kid but the school's valedictorian and eventually a good father.It's also great that there this is a lot of information at the end of the book in how to get help if you need it or how to become involved in the movement if you feel so inspired - and after reading this incredibly powerful book, you will."
2,Easy to Use,"Well made snap, easy on/off. Takes three batteries recommend batteries in bulk for best value. One light ok on pet, 2-3 per grandkid.Petsport Bling Bling Blinker, Red/White/Blue100 392 LR41 Watch Alkaline Batteries AG3 SR41 BatteryWell its been two yrs., time for update: Should not plan to leave on dog all the time, will come apart. Ok if you put on only when needed and it helped when I let dog run on farm at night. But do not recommend if you plan to leave on collar. Can fill a need for pets, grandkids, bikers etc. as light is easy to see. But will come apart if not taken off when not in use."
2,Underwhelmed...unfortunately.,"The product works well, just not for long. We used it on a camping trip recently, and I was pleased with the light output...until the batteries died 45 minutes later. The replacements that I bought at the store lasted about that long...so I'm left wondering. ""Is my snazzy new LED blinker really any better than the regular bulb ball? It isn't quite as bright...but lasts forever. Batteries are expensive!"
2,Not for active dogs,"I have an active dog, and due to the design of this light it has a tendency to go off if the dog runs or even walks fast. The light lasted all of three days, and every time I would have to tighten it harder just to get a light. On the fourth day the actual carabiner chain broke because it is made with cheap plastic. This would be a good product to have if you just wanted something for camping and then to throw it away."
2,disappointed,"I have a dog with one of these blinkers on her collar and love it. Sooo, I ordered more for my other dogs as well as a couple for a friend for a total of six. I opened three and the batteries did not work well: weak signal, barely blinking.They are being returned as I write this."
1,Not what I expected,"I was excited about buying these blinking lights, because I would be able to keep track of my dogs while walking at night.However, they only work sometimes. I have to tighten + untighten several times.......and even then, they do not always work. They would be great if they always worked, but they don't."
1,Too blinky!! Annoying!!,"This light was cheap enough, so worth a try, but after about 1/2 hour at the dog park and walking around, I had to turn it off because the speed of the blinking was so rapid, it was making me a little sick. So I don't know how durable it is because I couldn't deal with it anymore. I'll keep looking for a more toned down safety light, maybe just a glowing collar."
4,"A fun, quick read","When Valerie finds out that her mom is lesbian, she is devastated. How did this happen to her? Now she will have to choose who to live with, and there's the problem of what her friends will think once she tells them. So when Valerie's dad says he is moving to some tiny country that no one has heard of because of his new job (protocol chief for royal family), she decides to go with him because, let's face it, who wants to live with their lesbian mother and her girlfriend and transfer to a new school? Although Valerie is upset because she has to leave her friends and a potential boyfriend named David, she soon realizes that living in this new country could get pretty interesting, considering there is a young prince her age living in the palace (Valerie and her father have an apartment there since her father works for the royal family). The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because it is somewhat predictable, but it is still worth your money to buy it."
5,fun read,"Valerie Winslow's life has been turned upside-down. First, her mother announces that she's gay and is moving in with her girlfriend. Then, her father announces that he's being transferred from helping the President in Washington, D.C. to helping the royal family in Schwerinborg (or Smorgasbord, as most of Valerie's classmates call it), a tiny European country somewhere around Germany. Not wanting to face facts about her mother, Valerie moves to Schwerinborg. At first Schwerinborg seems kind of gray and dull, but then Valerie meets Georg, and things are looking up. But when she finds out that, in fact, he's Prince Georg, she isn't sure if it will go anywhere. She tries to find out if he's interested, while also trying to learn German so she can understand what everyone is saying, and she's in for some surprises. Another great book from Simon Romantic Comedies."
4,pretty entertaining.,"this book was pretty entertaining. at first i was reluctant to even cotinue with the book b/c i just was not interested enough by the cover lol. yes i kno i'm shallow, u're not suppose to jude the book by its cover but i did. it looked to me something a 12 year old would read. and i just not interested in that type of book. but i read it anywayz out of sheer boredom and i was hooked on it! i admit some of the parts were somewhat juvenile but i stilled enjoyed. i will read the sequel Spin Control: The Sequel to the Hit Royally Jacked Is Here!By Niki Burnham when it comes out in jan. 2005 i believe."
5,Indispensible for spaceship fans!,"It doesn't matter if you are a model-builder or not--I'm not--this book is indispensible for anyone even halfway interested in the spaceship as a cultural phenomenon--and I am. It covers the history of imaginative spacecraft from the early years of the 20th century up to the present, depicting spaceships from films, literature and even comic books. It is brilliantly and evocatively written, with hundreds of superbly reproduced illustrations--most of them in color. In fact, given the extraordinarily high quality of the book's production, I'm astonished it costs as little as it does--the publisher could easily have charge half again as much or more. A must-have for modelers, film fans, SF afficionadoes and aerospace buffs."
2,Underwhelmed,"Sounding like a record Juliana Hatfield (or White Stripes) would have recorded in a garage at age fourteen, this is not what I expected from someone this experienced. Admittedly I'm not a fan of raw roots rock anyway, production equipment was invented to be used in my opinion. But if you're going to do a record like this, there have to be killer passages to make up for the lack of gloss, and they just aren't there. This sounds like something Davis whacked out just for the fun of it. It's also pretty short."
2,Sugarbush Review,"The Sugarbush has a profound sense of tried enthusiasm written in it's words. Although the book has an odd version of writing never seen in any other book. The words are very abstruse in their meaning, and instead of being basic, profound, and good in sentence character, are too highly complex to enjoy. I disliked the sexual intimations in the very beggining of the book. Many authors decide to procrastinate sexual intimacy until the end. Yet this novel commerates a historic time and event, which is honored."
3,A Relevant Story of a Glimpse in the Past,"This summer I heard of a new book about the region around where my father lives from a friend. I decided to order it, sience many books about this subject are rarely published. As I sat down to read this book, I was looking forward to reading a very interesting novel about true life in the south. I actually think that the author had the whole history of the region and time down, but the story wasn't very conclusive in writing in my opinion at all. I enjoyed how the first page took me into somewhat of a haze back in time. I could imagine the scene being played out right in front of me. As the story went on, I became uninterested with some of the aspects written. The whole story was very historically significant, and I was enticed with it's detail the author put into every word. I feel that it wasn't a very touching story to the heart, but still learned about what life was like in a different time."
5,nascar 06,"nascar 2006 total team control is very fun.the best part about it is that you can switch cars with a teammate.22 offical tracks , loads of unlockables and drivers. and 4 racing series. and you can creat your own cars. me and my brother both liked the game and hope you like it to."
2,ok,this game was fun at first but then it got way to easy (like all nascar games). Its only fun when you are playing with 2 or more people. I would reccomed it if you can get it for under 10 bucks because thats all its worth.
1,very different and very bad,"There are so many things to say and so many places to statrt. My guess is that the people that used to design the game went on vacation and and told there helpers to come up with the best thing they could come up with. They did not give them there cell # if they ran into problems. They must have just said give them whatever you can come up with. 05,04,03 blow this away. EA I think you guys really fell asleep at the wheel on this one. Don't buy"
1,Do not waste your money!,Just traded in 2005 for 2006 and I am VERY unhappy. Online gameplay is slow and lagging. The cars handle poorly and the speeds do not match the play (i.e. if you are going 190 mph looks like you are going 75 mph). Not what I expected.
2,Disappointing,"Some of the bits made me laugh out loud, but there is a long bit in the middle of the tape that is uses the F-word repeatedly. That was a huge, disappointing, disturbing surprise."
1,fair at best,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I was expecting it to be a lot funnier.. I guess I remember Gilda differently. The film quality was grainy, not the best choice."
5,FINALLY!!!!,"I am THRILLED that they are finally releasing a Best of Gilda Radner DVD. I've only checked amazon.com every single day in hopes that it would be listed! Gilda Radner is the absolute greatest SNL player of all time, and she well deserves to have a DVD chock full of her greatest performances. Characters I hope to see on the DVD: Rosanne Rosannadanna, Emily Litella, Baba Wawa, Rhonda Weiss, Lisa Loopner, Judy Miller, Candy Slice, and Mrs. Douchebag."
3,Fair DVD,"Gilda Radner was a true classic. This DVD has some of her funniest moments, but lacks others. It seems it was put together without much thought to which skit should be where."
2,Never Mind,"I love Gilda Radner and have many of the SNL episodes with her best sketches.When I saw this ""Best of Gilda Radner"", claiming that it contains ""...all of her fantastic performances...."", I bought it and found that it's not close to including all her best performances. Only two Roseanne Roseannadanna and two Emily Litella skits. Some other so so clips took up the one hour program. How disappointing that Ms. Radner's talents cannot be found in one place after all these years..."
5,A+,DVD came in perfect condition.Gilda Radner was one of SNL's best comedians and this DVD doesn't disappoint or shame her legacy there. She certainly gave coming actors/comedians something to works towards. What a natural.
1,Very funny excerpts from SNL in the 1970's,"Very fuuny, If you loved SNL in the early 70's. this is one dvd you won't be sorry to have in your collection. Lots of funny skits."
5,Lynne,"OMG............I have wanted this DVD for ages. Whata great find. Gilda Radner is the epitomy of SNL.What a lose. She should have lived forever! Thanks,Amazon, for providing a place to buy dreams."
5,SNL Gilda,"What can I say? If you were around during the early years of SNL, this video is a must. One can easily forget the details over time. ""Gilda"" brings it all back in focus. I became teary eyed before the end. There is no substitute for the originals. Talk about cutting edge and being on top of ones game."
3,SNL relived,"Gilda Radner's clips from SNL were decent, but not great quality. The product was not advertised as anything less than good quality. Good content, not a great product."
5,For All the Gilda Radner Fans!!!,"This is the best of Gilda Radner! She is extremely funny, beautiful, adorable, and sexy! I have a little crush on her, but it totally sucks that she's dead. She is awesome! I love everything that she does on SNL. She has a lot of awesome characters like Roseanne Roseannadanna, Baba Wawa, Emily Litella, and much more! If you love classic comedy, and Gilda Radner, you'll love SNL: THE BEST OF GILDA RADNER!!!"
5,The Gilda DVD Rules,I've watched the 'Gilda Best Of VHS for nearly 15 years.This DVD just begins to fill in many of the gaps that the VHS left out.If you love Gilda --this DVD is a must--but SNL better have a Volume 2 ready to go soon!--There are many LOVED sketches and performances missing!!!!!!!!
3,More should have been available,"I loved Gilda Radner when she was alive and I love her now! My only complaint about this DVD is that I thought that more clips should have been included. To see this funny young lady going eye-ball to eye-ball with a beautifully cool Jane Curtin was enough to bring tears to my eyes - tears of laughter. Gilda was obviously enjoying herself in the skits that were selected and eveyone's favorites are represented but, for my money, there could never be too much Gilda!"
5,Love Gilda,OK! I just have to say that I couldn't stop watching this once it started. She was terrific on SNL!!!!
5,The Best of Gilda Radner,"This DVD of Gilda Radner's memorable moments on Saturday Night Live is a must have for Gilda fans. Well put together, nostalgic, and contains clips of all of her fan's favorite characters and skits."
1,Corona bi=pass shears weakness!,"These shears are a nice size and weight and well made BUT when my daughter, a 17 year old swimmer, was helping me clean up some brush she over did it on a dry (hard) 3/4"" branch and snapped the pivot bolt. Guess what? Corona doesn't make replacement parts for this specially designed bolt. No other bolt will do because of the fancy engineering design so they are trash now. Don't make the mistake of over doing them just a little or maybe even buying them in the first place!!!!!!"
5,Un-be-leivable,"As a fan of the original documentary, I was prepared to really loathe this adaptation. Oh great, another studied impersonation of a well-known cult figure by a big movie star. She's going to ruin it and embarrass herself.I was shocked. There are no words. Drew Barrymore not only defied any expectations I might have had about this performance, but I think she really redefined the impression I had of her as an actress. I always liked Drew and her bubbly personality, but this. This is unreal. Not to ignore Jessica Lange-- she is crazy/brilliant in this. The set design is spectacular. The whole film is very sympathetic, very respectful, evocative...I can't get over it. Don't hesitate to watch it. And have a hanky handy!"
2,Disk skips...,"I purchased this disk, Greay Gardens but when I went to view it, it skips. Cleaned the disk several times, nothing helped...bummed."
5,"""BEALE BOUVIER BOULEVARD""","WHY is this feature not on the BIG SCREEN?WHAT THE HELL WERE / ARE THE DSITRIBUTORS THINKING?WELL, so much for another Oscar to Ms. LANGE [Jessica's 3rd] and a richly deserved one to Ms. Barrymore - both ladies in roles that absolutely define Theapian Perfection.It is difficult to seperate the two actresses, absolutely the best we have ever seen Jessica Lange, and an eye-opener for those who need to experience the depth of emotion that Drew Barrymore has.Supporting cast - excellent - Daniel Baldwin [great to see him back], Ken Howard and a very gentle performance from Jeannine Tripplehorn as Jackie O.A sweet, sad movie ~ one not to be missed, perfect in all aspects, sound, music, costume, etc. etc.A loving tritube to Big and Little Edie.WE DO NEED TO AND MUST see more of Jassica Lange and Drew Barrymore in roles that they truly deserve ........Great Team~~~~~"
4,Love this movie!,"After watching this movie, I had to buy the original. This version with Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange is well done, but the original move is riveting. You've got to see it!"
3,Kim,"While I enjoyed the acting by the actors involved and the story line, it was not the sort of movie I normally buy. I prefer warhistorical,action,adventure,mystery,films."
2,Disappointed,I have read several books about Gray Gardens the home of Jackie O's aunt. I was very disappointed in this movie. Drew did an excellent job but the movie was not well written.
2,"Good Acting, Lame Story","A morality tale and character study of the effects of parental domination and the resulting frustration of a daughter who fails to achieve her potential. Well..a little more complicated than that, but you get the idea. Primarily a film that will appeal more to women than men. Very slow moving and repititious IMHO."
1,Lame!!!,"The worst movie I've ever seen. I don't understand the fascination with the whole Camelot thing. A total bore fest. I made it through the whole thing only because I thought there might be some kind of twist,(nope),just more of the same."
5,"BLU RAY, PLEASE!","Both actresses were deserving of the awards they received for this film, and then some. Drew Barrymore's dedication to her role was extremely apparent, as was Jessica Lange's dive into Big Edie. Nothing but wonderful things to say about this movie...now I just want to make sure it makes it to blu ray!"
2,misleading product info by publisher,"The book is ok, to be honest it made things clear BUT it clearly stated from the publisher that there was a companion website that offered animations, quiz generators etc. etc. sound good? well, not so fast, the only thing on the website is an image bank of the illustrations ALREADY IN THE BOOK! Apparently the rest of it is only available for instructors. Of course, once you scratch off and reveal the code to enter the website it nullifies your ability to return the book. And those ""pocket size"" study cards are just more illustrations but the size is much larger than normal pockets (hint: they are pages to be torn from the book..full sized pages) most would assume pocket sized to mean about the size of a 3x5 card otherwise just lug the book around. In any case, like I said the book I would rate a 3-4 the resources promised -1"
5,Anatomy and Physiology Made Incredibly Easy,"The book just brings things together, a logical pathway to understand the process, for me anyway! I definitely would reccommend this book. Bre"
2,Incredibly Easy? What a joke!,"When I first saw the title I was already a little leery. Anatomy & Physiology is a difficult subject if for no other reason than the fact that there are lots and lots of jawbusting terms to remember, most of which come from Latin. So how could you possibly make that easy?Well it turns out you can't! There is no magic way to make all those names go away, and there is no magic way to learn to remember them. Adding a lot of cute cartoon drawings does not make the subject any simpler. The book simply skips a lot of stuff, uses many terms that it never defines and leaves the reader the worse off for it. I was studying Anatomy & Physiology in college and we were using a monster text. So I thought this book would simplify the whole thing for me. All it did was give me two books to be frustrated with AND skip incredibly important stuff that weakened my understanding instead of helping me.I CANNOT recommend this book at all!"
4,Helpful therapy,I hurt my shoulder in a bicycle accident four months ago. This video had three workout levels to rehab your hurt muscles; each with an actor doing the exercise in the same room with the instructor. It showed me how weak my shoulder is and how much I need this workout. Well worth the money. The surgeon who produced this series makes sure you do not overdo the exercises. He is good. I bought the BACK DVD and may also order the KNEE DVD after I master these two. I am falling apart in my old age (LOL)(59 yo) and see the need to carefully exercise injuries to get back to full health.
2,should have been better,"The book consists of 47 essays by different authors, each essay an average of 9 pages long, where the author gives their anecdotal story or insight. And then there is another 20 pages at the end of the ""what to know when you travel there"" stuff.It is a great idea for a book, and a you should read it if going to Spain, but I just wish they had used better authors. Nothing from Hemingway, Washington Irving, nothing from the Spaniards themselves like Cervantes and Lorca. The writing seems too modern, not deep, nor funny, nor penetrating enough: Not up to the task at hand. Although the writing is OK, there must be better insights written than these. This could have been a better book, considering the subject is Spain, it could have been a much much better book."
4,Technically acurate and ingenious ideas for science fiction,"As a particle physicist I learned much from this book. When Forward discusses situations about which I know some details he almost always has it right, so I trust him when he discusses situations about which I know little. The short stories that follow the technical chapters are ingenious, although they do not all relate well to the preceding technical chapter. I would like to have had more discussion about the relative probabilities of the various scientific theories yielding useful technology."
3,hard sci-fi,"very well researched and delivered, but the physicsis hard, and I have to keep putting down the book anddoing research."
2,It's not all that it's cracked up to be.,It isn't that great. Not worth spending all the money. I would not spend the money on this hair spray again.
4,Great Product 3rd time purchasing.,This product does not stiffen hair nor does it have an odor. If I need to touch up during the day I can go through my hair without a problem yet my hair continues to stay in place.
2,Disappointing Gorman,"The second installment in the Noah Ford series is a disappointing read. Ford, a federal agent in the 1880's west, is an interesting character that Gorman does not really develop. I am a big Gorman fan, be it westerns, mysteries or thrillers, but this just doesn't cut it. There is no real sense of time or place in this novel. It feels much too contemporary, and just seems to plod along. The mystery itself isn't enaging. The western aspects are negligible. This could be a contemporary mystery just as easily as a westernI have enjoyed Gorman's books for years, and if has his name on the cover, I will read it. But if you are new to Gorman, there are better places to go in either mystery or western field."
2,Full Track Missing,"I am excited about this album. It has one problem that is irritating. Many of the songs end abruptly and usually without really ending. I think they tried to put too much on one album.GREAT MUSIC, too bad they short change it with almost every song.RB"
2,Be Aware! This CD only contains song instrumentals.,"When I purchased this CD, I was not made aware that it was only a collection of instrumental versions of the listed songs. It is a great collection of songs with the printed words included in the CD cover--but not one word is sung to the music on the disk! Now I understand the title better. Beware!!Cuando compré este CD, no se me dio cuenta que el disco fue nada más que una coleccíon de canciones en versiones instrumentales. Sin duda es una gran colección de canciones por Perales, una que incluye la letra imprimida en la solapa--¡pero no hay ninguna palabra cantada en este disco! Ahora comprendo mejor el titulo. ¡Cuidado!"
5,Great Book,"I read that this was former pres. Bill Clinton's favorite golf book. Though not a big Clinton fan I took the former pres advice and am happy I did. Great book, pleasant reading, really set me straight. Hats off to the author, will read more."
1,Not a good book for a beginner,I got this book thinking it would be good for a beginning golfer. I was very disappointed. The concepts were much too difficult for a beginning golfer or just not well written or communicated to the reader. The illustrations weren't helpful either. A much better book for beginners would be the Golf Handbook for Women by Vivien Saunders.
3,worth another .5 on top of that,"although this is a perfectly pleasant listen, i was decidedly disappointed with it. i know a few guys who have it and love it, but that's only because they don't own the best GZM has to offer. this album is intriguing in the sense that the band has begun to stretch a bit, test their boundaries, and while most of the material is the same old welsh experimental folk-pop they've been doing for years, some of the songs reach the 7 minute mark. it just isn't quite as exciting, not quite as vibrant as the majority of their previous albums have been."
3,it's time to change,"hey guys don't you remember about the old Gorky's albums? Those were good stuff. I loved Barafundle and the things they did before it and after (Gorky 5). The following works are good yes! but too much country music. I am not saying that i dont like them cos GZM are my best group but please stop it now!!!!This album is kinda the other last two, no news about them but a few songs...Btw buy this album after you buy the early years :)"
5,Great old shows,This is in my opinion some of John Wayne's best movies that were ever madefrom the early days besides some of his westerns.
5,Good rare film,I enjoy it because the sound is 5.1 and the production is a consulting about strategy and their decisions that should taked by the protagonists
3,Enjoyed the stories,Enjoyed the stories of the movies. Quality was much better than JWestern Legends. Didn't realize the movies were black and white.
4,Everybody Has One,"Although I have the 1989 version, 12 years later I'm still using it for trial work. Maybe it's the 18 perfectly-spaced, clearly labeled flip-tabs, starting with ""relevance"" and running through competence, privilege, admissions, demonstrative evidence, impeachment, hearsay (2 tabs), authentication, objections, and a few more. There's a section on offers of proof and parol evidence, too.The principles, key cases, and tactical pointers are set out in bold, bullets, and section headings. This book hits it just about right for the general commercial trial lawyer. It's especially useful to cite to enough detail in a hurry, to overcome the skimpy defense-lawyer motions defense lawyers tend to lob around the courtroom during trial.The 3 ring flip-book format has advantages to Hunters or Mauet; and bringing Mauet to court with you risks looking funny."
2,Unreliable,"I've purchased a total of 12 controllers for our 2 cubes: these had the shortest shelf life. One died in the first week, the other made it a month. I got them for the small size for my kids' hands, and that aspect is nice, but they're just too fragile."
5,Good standard cheap controller,"Looking for a replacement for an old controller that had worn.This one is a little smaller, but works totally fine. The buttons aren't refined, but they get the job done. This is totally what I was looking for as a basic replacement."
1,Crappy Remote,As soon as I opened the package I could see this was a cheapo product. I purchased it for my son because I liked the smaller size. He's 3 1/2. Anyway he quickly became frustrated with it and when I tried it out I realized the buttons were not responding properly. Needless to say I quickly returned it with no hassles (Thanks Amazon).
1,"Sticky buttons, useless in a few weeks","DO NOT BUY these controllers. I know they are cheap, but it takes only a short time before the buttons start sticking."
5,My kids love it,"We haven't had the product long, but so far no problems. I make sure my kids (ages 6 & 8) don't throw them around, they are not made to be ""ruff-handled"". Like I said,so far- so good."
1,Gamecube Pro Mini Controller 2 not what is seems.,"I got this Gamecube Pro Mini Controller 2 on Dec 5. I opened it up. Did not even plug in the controller and say it was broke. The end of the plug was coming off. I started to use it with a game and two buttons would not work right. The (B) button, not working at all. In the future I will remember not to order anything from Intec. I should have taken it to heart what the other reviewers said, Shame on me.In a few days I'll return this controller. Think twice when ordering this item."
4,Creamy Taste Not Too Sweet Or Strong,I love Cappucino so thought I would give this a try. Very good approximation of the creamy taste of Cappucino! Coffee is mild and doesn't overpower the Cappucino flavor. Not a strong coffee if you are concerned it may be on the dark espresso side of the coffee spectrum. I do not taste the vanilla or the cinnamon flavors but that does not detract from the taste for me. Vanilla must be a difficult flavor to approximate without adding syrup. I have bought the Coffee Masters Double Vanilla flavor blend and did not taste vanilla at all - well maybe a whisper of vanilla. The taste is not sweet so you can flavor to your taste. I am liking this Cappucino flavor! Now considering saving for an espresso maker!
5,A cafe favorite,"comes to you from Coffee Masters. A nice creamy flavor, although I do not taste the touch of cinnamon as described. Add creamer for a lighter texture. Again, a coffee that can be served anytime of the day. Nice enough on it's own, no dunking needed."
3,Read the fine print!,This is all instrumental music-no vocals. I should have read the details but assumed it also included the vocals!
1,"DON""T EVEN MIND THIS DVD!","I just wanna say to every beatleman: don't bothered with this DVD. It was rerecorded from VHS and its quality is the worse i've ever seen! The sound is awful (there are unknown track instead of Beatles's songs half of time). I've never thought something with the Beatles would be so annoying! Moreover, it's 'made in Thailand'!You know it's up to you, but i wouldn't buy this if i knew..."
1,not what I expected,"I thought the dvd was about the concert the Beatles did in Australia and it wasn't, it was just pieces of a documentary of the Beatles goin to Australia, no music no nothing."
4,"Hey, It's The Beatles!","up, DOWN UNDER, over, sideways, I don't care how you look at it... It's THE BEATLES!I happen to be a fan, so I like seeing The Fab Four, especially in those early days of Beatlemania, any way I can!I saw them at The Hollywood Bowl in 1964, and again at Dodger's Stadium in '65! This brought back a lot of great memories!It's not the best video, of those days, I've seen, but like I said, ""Hey, it's The Beatles!"""
3,Good basic overview of contracts and grants,"This book will have value to someone just beginning to explore either federal contracts or grants. It is fairly dated and attempts too much for its size, but it provides enough information to be useful without danger of overwelming the reader."
5,the ultimate gift,This book was so inspiring. It actually helped my husband and I lookinto adoption. We are now awaitng the arrival of our son.
4,"Fun, Engaging -- makes you want to performbv","While ""Wrong for Each Other"" may not be a the most weighty play, it is a well crafted journey through the highs and lows of one couple's relationship. Over the course of the two acts, we watch Rudy and Nora navigate the path to love and back. Through this journey, we are amused, saddened and most importantly turned inward. There is something in both characters for everyone. Beyond all of this, it just makes you want a stage and an audience -- the material is light, fun, and intriguing to perform. I can recommend it wihtout reservation."
4,Swell,"Very nice, earthly music with a touch of ocean sounds and drums.I found it very relaxing and will most likely add it to my chill-out playlist.If you like Pure Moods or ambient type music, you will enjoy this too."
3,Lots Better When I Was Young,"When I first read Donna Parker in Hollywood I was ten years old. I enjoyed it and the rest of the books in the series, as did my younger sister. Now that we are reading it in our forties (reliving the joys of youth), the book certainly seems to have lost its lustre. I guess you can't go home again. At least not with Donna Parker."
1,yuck,"i've read all the all the books in this series and this was the worst of them all.liz and salvaldor aren't even together in this one.salvadors off with some stupid girl erin that he ""falls in love with."" i didnt like this book at all.hope the next ones r better."
3,O.K,This book was o.k. I read all the others so far and this is the worst. Salvador and Liz sould be together! Other then that though it was o.k.
2,Very Disappointed,Not happy with this purchase. Did not look like the photo. Quality and appearance is disappointing. Not worth the price.
2,"Jonathan Hunt--If This Is Your Day Job, Please Quit It","Holy Toledo. I never thought I would EVER hear such horrible vocals in all my born days. Take the worst qualities (if indeed you can call them qualities) of metal voices such as Chronos, Dani Filth, Tom Araya, and Bruce Dickinson, shake them up in a bag, and what do you get? Jonathan Hunt. Fingernails scraping down a blackboard have nothing on his terrible, terrible style. His voice is raspy beyond belief, but that would be okay if he had any sort of timbre at all. He has NONE. Let me repeat that. He has NONE. What he has is a roaring whisper for a voice, which sounds suspiciously like an adolescent trying to imitate Rob Zombie.The only thing that saves this album from completely fumbling the ball is that the musicianship is pretty good. These guys show promise. It just remains to be seen whether or not Jonathan Hunt will continue to hold them down."
4,Thunder & Lightning,I purchased the Color organ kit as a prop for halloween. I lked the case and look of this product. Expect to have to do basic/intermediate soldering ... I have little or no experience in this - but I youtubed a video on soldering and was fine after a few practice tries.It was exactly as described - although it did come with a european power cord instead of a north american version.
2,I hope this is not the Gabelli Way.,"I am unsure what book the rest of the reviewers are reading; but it was not this one. The book is not only ambiguous, but poorly crafted with topical transitions sloppy. I can comfortably say that there is not a single section of the book that adequately unveils the dynamics of various convertible instruments or their pricing. Indeed, the book reads more like a glossary than an explanatory text and for persons new to converts, the spate of regurgitated pricing theories will likely do more harm then good. Perhaps the one strength of the text is that it serves as a broad reference for readers truly interested in converts to seek out more educative pieces. For more informed readers, modest incremental knowledge seems to be the only gain."
5,comprehensive book that's great for any knowledge level,"This book is a fantastic resource for investors who are new to convertibles, convertible experts and everyone in between. It provides a great breadth of topics as well as a perfect amount of depth. It covers the full range of convertible products, the theory behind them and convertible investing strategies. I'll be keeping this book handy."
4,In-depth Coverage,"I never thought I could learn about convertibles with such ease, and what's more, from one of the masters in the industry. If you're looking for a thorough explanation, and a step-by-step guide to using convertibles, you've just found it."
4,A Gift to Us All,"It is so easy to avoid real life today, losing ourselves in the latest fiction or subject of interest, but when we do choose to encounter it, the rewards are usually great. So it is with Maria Ruiz Scaperlanda's gift to us all, ""Their Faith Has Touched Us."" For those who are willing to make the journey, Maria brings to life the beauty of three young Oklahomans who were killed in the tragic bombing of the Murray Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Through the eyes of those who knew and loved them we too learn to know them and to sense the deep loss. It is a sad and hopeful book at the same time, inspiring true respect for the people, faith, and values that helped form three such memorable, and missed, individuals. Some books we read for distraction, some we read for information, and some we read because they enrich us at our very core. Maria's book we read to be enriched."
2,There's got to better material than this!,"What a waste of money, not to mention of all the clips they could have shown. My family was totally dissappointed as with some of the other SNL Best of Clips. Wouldn't reccommend it."
3,I've Laughed Harder,"I don't know if I am just older now or if they didn't choose John's best, but this lacks the humor that I remember. I laughed harder when I was younger. I found him cute in various skits, but there was nothing on here that was gut wrenching funny like I remember it. I remember my father walking in on my brother and I and saying, ""What do you you find so funny?"" and us telling him to go back to bed, that it was a generational thing. Now I wonder if it was an age thing. I am over 35 now-- does that make a difference? I feel very old. I still like this, however and showed my teenagers who weren't too enamored with it but did compare John's eyebrow raising to Jack Black and found certain nuances worthy of observation to take to acting class."
3,Major disappointment,"There's hardly anything to this! I expected many more clips from his time on SNL. I feel like I watched an advertisement for the real thing - seriously, this is all there is? John Belushi was the best, but this DVD is a joke."
1,"John Belushi was great, BUT .....","I can't make myself buy this DVD. I was going to purchase it, but then I read where O.J. Simpson is in one of the skits. Can't do it now. Maybe there will be a ""Best of Belushi Part 2"" that doesn't have an O.J. Simpson appearance.Peace and long live the ""classic"" SNL!!"
2,Miles Cowperthwaite,Belushi's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite Monty Python's Michael Palin as the MANLY Captain Ned in the Miles Cowperthwaite skits. They are both absent from this DVD nor on any SNL video I can find.
2,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!,DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE NO OTHER SYSTEM BESIDES GBA! the gameplay absolutley stinks after playing I simply said are you kidding me. Even though it is obvious not ot expect alot from a gbagame when it comes to madden I was dissapointed. The computer is very good and it is impossible for u to have a passing game. in my opinon gba is not complex enough to have a football game such as madden
3,What happened?,"As a long-time fan of all the artists that make up Fourplay, I was particularly disappointed in Journey. While the playing is high-quality, the compositions are not. The songs sound forced, as if they were in a hurry to release another album. These guys are capable of much better (as they have shown many times over the last 30 years.) If you haven't bought a Fourplay album previously, skip this one. Buy Heartfelt instead. If you are a Larry Carlton fan and you like ""the blues,"" buy Sapphire Blue."
2,Elevator Music,"Is the spark gone? Honestly, these songs put me to sleep and make me want to press ""Lobby"". You're too good to put this out. I own all the CDs, some of the DVDs of concerts, seen them play live as well. I am a big fan, but this CD just doesn't evoke any emotion."
1,Fourplay!!! .......Hardly,Wasn't a drop down box for half star so had to give it 1. Worst Fourplay album to date. Rather insulting realy. Did they get together & decide to bash a couple of tracks together to keep the record company happy?. And this from four seasoned producers.... Save your money
2,Snoozer,"I am a big Foreplay fan and have several of their cd's with their various lineups over the years. Even a couple Larry Carlton driven tunes could not save this one.This cd is just plain boring.This is the definition of muzak.Go get a Jeff Golub or Jeff Lorber cd to hear some smooth urban jazz with some soul, or almost any previous Foreplay cd has more spark than this.I am glad I bought it used for 8 bucks.You have been warned."
3,Fourplay - Journey,I have bought all of Fourplay's albums since their first in 1991. I am not impressed at all with this latest release. What has happened to Nat's soulful vocals ? The title track Journey does not sound like it should be on a Fourplay album ! A couple of the tracks sound like they were left over from the 4 album as that C.D had a particular dullness to it and this comes out in these tracks. I always await a new Forplay release with excitement. Sadly this fails to excite.
1,Lackluster,"This is a very lackluster effort that often sounds like tunes left over from Bob James albums of the 1980's. Everyone sounds like they are going through the motions. The lone exception is Cool Train with it's classic, subtle riffs by Larry Carlton. I saw one reviewer was glad he only paid $8 for this cd. Well, I only paid $3 for it and I traded it in the next day. You have now been DOUBLE WARNED....... P.S. Nathan - please stick with what you do best - play bass and mix in some scat. Spare us any more vocals and DJ scratches."
2,What the heck???,"What is Fourplay thinking?? ""Instead of doing the things our fans want to hear, let's go off the deep end"" Wow! This is the worst Fourplay CD I've heard! Yes, Please and Elixir are the best ones whil;e Heartfelt seemed like they were going in a different direction. Journey proves that! Now that X has come out, it's like they never changed after Yes, Please!...Do yourself a favor and skip this one...get Yes, Please or Elixir instead!"
5,Great Phones,"Phones have clear voice volume, great battery life and good features. I am happy with the purchase."
5,Super Phones,"I do not usually recommend products to others, however this is a super good telephone. I live in a log cabin located on a lot of 1 acre in rural South Dakota. The range on this phone covers all of my property plus over half of my up hill neighbors. The numbers and features are easy to read and understand."
3,Panasonic three-handset unit,"I was glad that the unit was expandable, but I found that it was slightly inferior to the VTech 6.0 three-handset unit. The VTech is more user-friendly, has a nicer ""feel"" to the handsets, and the voice prompts are superior. I ended up returning the Panasonic unit and buying the VTech from Amazon."
4,Almost a great purchase,"This phone system is almost perfect. It has good sound quality & it is easy to put a call on theloud speaker while you are talking. You can't take it off the loud speaker once you put it on, however.I would like to be able to take the call off the loud speaker if a friend happens to come into the room.That is a small irritation. The major concern (which might cause me to purchase a different system next time) is that the call indicator has a light only alarm to let you know you have received a message. I forget to look at the base unit (the only place a call indicator is located) to see if the light is flashing. I muchprefer a beep tone indicating you have received a call with a message. It is easy to go several days without knowing someone has left you a message. The unit I owned previously had a beeper and light, the beeper was optional - a much better system"
2,Lacks distinctive ring feature for incoming calls,"I bought this system to replace an earlier Panasonic DECT 6.0 system that was starting to get glitchy. I have been happy with Panasonic, but this new phone system lacks a feature I had come to rely on: no option to set distinctive rings for certain callers. Four ringtones and 10 different melodies, but you can't set any of them to a specific caller, sadly. I didn't realize the distinctive caller ring feature was so important to me until it was gone. Definitely a deal-breaker. I returned this system, and am limping along with my old one (KX-TGA931) until I find a quality phone set with the distinctive ring option. Any suggestions? I called Panasonic, and was told that none of the phones they currently manufacture have the distinctive caller ringtone feature. Disappointing."
2,Good if you don't need to walk far from the central base,"I bought this product one year 3 months ago. I have a 2000 square foot house, so this product should be able to reach. I put the central base in the middle of the house and still had problems getting the 2nd handset to connect on one end--so, sometimes I would have to walk toward the center of the house to get it connect before making my call. Other than that, the phones worked well. More recently, the phone has started disconnecting me while on a call in the house. I've previously had great phones with Panasonic and will be replacing these."
4,Great phones with one exception,"Everything about these phones - range, clarity, non-interference with Wi-Fi - is great except one. The menus could have been simplified. Non-intuitive, I think would be a good description. Of course, I already knew that from the other reviews before I ordered. Would I buy the same phones again now that I have experienced them? Sure! It only takes a while to learn the menus and the phones work very well."
3,works well except for some bugs,"We have had the phone for 3 months now and for the most part we are happy with the phone system:Pros:The battery life is good.The distance/clarity is good - can take it into the backyard.The intercom feature is usefull.Cons:The Caller ID doesn't seem to give as much info as our previous panasonic phone, such as not telling us the persons name- just giving a phone number.Individual phones don't always ring and we rely on hard wired phones to hear the ring.There are occasional bugs like unexplanable beeps or going to a busy signal during conversations. If these problems happen more often this is a big problem. A phone should work always, first and foremost. I will return it as defective if it continues.The answering machine doesn't have an audible beep to let you know there is a message."
4,Good stuff,"A great unit and by far the cheapest I found it when shopping in Jan, 2008. Works great. Get a headset and you'll be living the dream. Speakerphone is nice, battery life great, range very good. If, like me, you're stepping up from an older cheapo phone, this is a great choice."
5,Best Panasonic phone we ever owned,"We had a great 2.4 Gh Panasonic cordless phone system that only supported up to three handsets so we decided to look for a new system that could handle more phones than that for our new house.We bought this system based on the Amazon reviews alone and are very very very happy we did! There is no interference from the microwave or the home wireless network and the newer features are great. For instance, the ability to store all your memory phone numbers in one handset and then forward them ALL to every other handset on the system is a HUGE timesaver.We also added two more handsets which was extremely easy. We didn't even have to read the directions out of the box to add these new handsets. Really easy."
3,Definitely a challenge!,"First the pros: they look good, are lightweight, take up little space, voice quality excellent, programming not too difficult.Cons: Caller id very erratic...sometimes just says ""out of area""...why?Difficult erasing ""missed calls"". Time lapse before seeing caller id.I already recommended this phone to my son and he's experiencing the same problems. Don't think I'd recommend this product to anyone else.Signed: Ready to scream."
2,Very Limited Range,"Works OK and has lots of nice features. However, the range is very limited from base to remotes: LESS than 30 feet."
5,Great product,Extremely pleased. I purchased two sets - one for my home and one for my mother. Very easy to setup and easy to use. We are both satisfied with product. Performs exactly as described in advertisement.
4,Very good phone,"After reading all the reviews, we ordered this phone. We have only had the Panasonic TG1033S for one day, but it is already far superior to our previous V-Tech 5.8 gh phone. From the first time we tried it, all of the static and buzzing noises on the phone were gone.I do agree that navigating through the phone is a bit time consuming which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5. However, the guide is dummy proof. It tells you step by step exactly what button to press for what you want to do. The handset is extremely light weight. The phonebook is much better than on our previous phone. It lets you edit the numbers very simply--our old phone wouldn't let you do this. This also has a previous number called memory which I like. Transferring information from one handset to another is very easy and very convenient. As with any product, it is not perfect, but for the money, it is a good system.The time of shipping from Amazon was great."
4,phone,"Good clear sound.This is replacing a old at+t tape unit.The one thing I miss is being able to leave a memo or keep the message for the next person in.It does have no memory aaa batts,thats one reason i chose it."
2,Disappointed,"One handset defective, so now I must send to service center in Texas. Never had this issue with Panasonic phones before, and I don't like it! Base/recorder and other handset seem to be working fine."
3,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 3 Handset Cordless KX TG1033S,I love the phone except for the answering machine. The message is slightly garbled. It should be much clearer.
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 3 Handset Cordless Phone,I have been using my phones about 1-1/2 months now. They seem to work very well and have no complaints. Set up was very easy. I would recommend them to anyone.
1,Huge disappointment!,I had no choice but to return the Panasonic KX-TG10335 Dect 6.0 telephone set because it's virtually impossible to operate outside of the U.S. - I live overseas and have done this for many years: I generally replace the 110 Volt AC/DC adaptor with a European 220V one ... The Panasonic KX-TG10335's adaptor now works with 6.5 volts output making it impossible (I believe on purpose)to substitute for any of the commercially available adapters (they are adjustable to the following output voltage: 3 - 4.5 - 6 - 7.5 - 9 - 12 ... BUT NOT 6.5 !!!) Bad bad feature for all those people who are relocating around the world for work!
3,Great phone - but not during a power outage.,"This phone is definitely the best cordless that I've ever used, and all its features are great, but if you need a phone during a power outage to report the outage, like we do living in a rural area, then you'll need a backup, because without power the base unit can't broadcast. The manual does say you'll need another phone for use during power outages. If I'd known this beforehand I wouldn't have purchased it."
1,Disappointing - no delivery of product,In the past few weeks we order two items from Amazon. After two weeks we were informed that neither product was available. It was particularly discouraging that your intracompany communication is lacking in that we were ask to rate a product(s) that you should have known were not received.
2,mediocre at best,"This phone works when it wants to. The auxiliary handsets only ring about half the time when the main hand set rings, and they show the caller ID only about half of that half. Frequently when trying to use an auxiliary handset in other parts of our not-large house, we'll get the ""move closer to base"" message. When talking on the auxiliary handsets, the audio quality is frequently very poor with static and an under water-type sound. Several calls were dropped. I would never buy this phone again and in fact am planning to return it."
2,will not recharge,"Have had this phone for less than one year, and two of the four phones will not recharge, even after putting in new batteries. We threw them away as, of course, they would cut out in the middle of a phone conversation."
4,Phone--good Answerer--not so much,The quality of the phones is excellent. Very good sound quality. The answering machine sounds terrible and the lack of message counter stinks as well.
3,Review,"The phones are just OK. The answering system doesn't tell you how many messages you have, but I do like that you can listen to your a call coming into the answering device from any handset. Great way to sceen youryour calls. Also, sometimes the sound seems to deaden when you are talking and I am not sure if the other person is still on the line."
5,Love my phones.,"I really love these phones. I love the clarity, the fact you can copy your phone list from one to the other, and the fact that you can have each phone alert you if there is a message. My other set only alerted from the base unit. I really feel this was a very good investment."
1,High Pitched Screeching,When two people are talking on handsets simultaneously the phones emit a painful high-pitched screeching noise that renders them useless. I really wanted to like these phones but this is a major flaw that cannot go unnoticed and is the reason I'm returning these. Panasonic isn't necessarily a bad brand but avoid this specific model. You get what you pay for.
1,lousy range,"I live in a NYC apartment that is fairly long but not a palace by any means. Still, I often cannot get reception at one end of the apartment, even though the base is located in a room in the middle. The entire distance cannot be more than 50 feet. For a product that is supposed to feature the latest in cordless technology, that is ridiculous."
2,A few flaws,"No matter how high I turn up the volume, its hard to hear. I'd been using the phone company's voice mail. Wasn't anywhere as convenient as pressing a button. But the sound quality is poor -- hard to make out what is being said. and the replay feature isn't as simple as it could be.I've tried any number of different cordless phones. None seem especially good at what should be something easy. This is as good as I've found -- but that's not high praise"
4,Panasonic Phones Offer Quality,"These phones do what they promise. High-end features that work well. Good menu system on each handset. Lightweight handsets with good broadcast range, each with its own charger.Great product."
3,Panasonic 3phone 6 Ghz always too far from home base,"Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 3 Handset Cordless Phone System with Answering System (KX-TG1033S)Continualy get message no link to base. Move closer to base and try again, I get this message at distances (<<<100ft) that make the other phones almost useless. I think that the phone needs a more powerful tranmitter."
4,Readable Dial,It is very nice to have dial buttons that we can see and touch with ease. Our former phones were too small and thus dialing was more difficult. Everything over all is very satisfactory..from rings to answering service.
4,Panasonic Cordless Phone,"The product has not disappointed. My only problem is that my phone service provides voice mail and I haven't figured out whether to use the message feature that comes with the phone or the voice mail service. It is not an insurmountable problem, but I am going to have to study the usage manual. Sometimes it comes to that."
4,Pleased with phone but not with the seller,"I purchased this phone on 02-01-09 and took delivery about a week later. The seller shipped the item in a box three times larger than necessary with no packing, foam or other protection. The three handsets, three bases, and batteries were just rattling around in the box and to my amazement there was no damage. The seller needs to take note of this because maybe they were just lucky this time!The phone itself works wonderfully. It has all the features I was looking for in a phone. The reception is great inside and outside the house but the range is less than my old Panasonic cordless so that is the reason for my 4 out of 5 Stars. Great buy for the money but I would purchase from a different seller to avoid possible breakage in transit."
2,Handset volume problems,"The volume on this phone fades in and out, even on the highest setting. After 3 months one of the handsets is non-functional because no one can hear me even if I shout. I am very disappointed in this phone and will probably just pitch it."
3,Trusty Panasonic phones,"Work very well overall. I have had Panasonic phones previously and been pleased. Just be sure to place the base unit at a tall enough (maybe 5 to 6 feet or more off the ground) point -- such as on top of a bookshelf, to ensure that you have a smooth connecton from a handset to the base unit. If the base unit is not placed high enough, as used to happen with my phones, you will probably drop connections. Placing my base unit higher has made a big difference even in my 2-bedroom home.Otherwise, my set of three phones works fine. The battery is fairly long-lasting, and even if I am afraid it is low on power, I simply switch on another one of the phones while talking on the first, and re-plug in the first phone. Have had my phones for 2-3 years now."
3,Panosonic phones,"I like them. One thing that bothers me is the way it sounds muted when you are talking. I cant think of a great way to explain, you can hear the other end great, its how you hear this muted air. It goes in and out. Weird! Otherwise, it has great features once you figure them out. (I didnt read the manual!) For the price, they are great phones!"
1,STATIC FRUSTRATED!!,I am so frustrated with the static on this phone. I bought it thinking I would not have this problem and all I get is static. It drives me nuts... I can't figure it out.....I wish I could because I don't know what my options are as far as another phone....
3,Pasonic KX-TG1033S,"Panasonic KX-TG1033S Dect 6.0 Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System with 3 HandsetsThis is an OK product, probably good if you did not compare with others.Pros: large buttons, no sticking out antenna, long battery life (not as long as advised though)Cons: Range is not better than 5.8GHZ, speaker volumn not loud enough, more difficult to navigate through menus, cannot customerized ringtone and led colour for individual callers.I am using the 5.8GHZ Panasonic(2 years old) and need a couple more handsets, so I thought I'd try out the DECT 6.0, big dissapointment. I have assigned rington and colour so I know when marketing is calling or family member but I cannot do that with these new phones other than physically look at the phone."
4,voice is bit low,"I always love the latest technology, and bought this phone from here. Overall it's pretty good, just couple of minor things short to make it close to perfect,1) the incoming voice is low, there's no button/menu indicates how to dial up the volume. Called Panasonic tech support, and was told to use the upper of that round button to dial it up while talking. This is the only way to change the volume. Even though it works, but the maximum volume is still low compared to other phones.2) The menu is not that great, and not easy to use."
4,"Great Phone, but could have been better...","Just purchased this phone system and have the same postive comments that other reviewers have listed. The negatives I see are: no speed dial capabilities which I love to use for my frequently called friends, range is not great outside, no message count or displays on base, menu system could be more streamlined for quicker access.All in all, a good phone system though."
3,I should have bought the Panasonic 6.0 9334 Series,"The 1033 series is still a great phone, but for a few dollars more, the 9334 series is far better. My neighbor has the 9334 series and when I bougth the 1033 phones, I did not realize my error - I wanted the same phone set she has. However, the 1033 is still an excellent choice, but spend the extra $10 - $20 and get the 9334 phones.You do not get automatic copying from one phone to the others, call blocking, nor night-time mode."
1,"My worst phone, ever","I hate this phone! I've had it since April and, hard-head that I am, thought it would get better, it did not!Pros-easy to transfer phonebook to other handsets.Cons-no way to turn off the ringer at the base. Each handset must be programmed to not ring but you still get the greeting blaring everywhere. I want an simple way to silence all my phones and still receive messages.It loves to ""lose"" the base connection in the middle of a phone call. Lovely when you've been on hold with, say an airline or credit card company for a half hour. Just queue back up!Bottom line, I hate this phone so much it is going in the trash! I'll recycle the batteries but would not pay someone to take this phone system much less donate to a charity.I've just placed an order for another brand that I've had good results with in the past. I researched more and hope they deliver."
2,"This Panasonic ""big button"" keypad does not light up...! Get the AT&T 6.0 ""big button"" phone instead...","The Panasonic 6.0 works well and has big buttons but--big buttons don't help in the dark! I returned this and bought anAT&T; 6.0--also with big buttons and that light up...I suspect that all 6.0 cordless phones are good. I am only prejudiced against Vtech due to experiences with previous models.Maybe I am incorrect. Maybe the Panasonic 6.0 keypad does light up. But mine didn't seem to and so I returned it before it got used. Can you find 'lighted keypad' listed here? Well I can't.Therefore we went with the AT&T; 6.0 and turned the volume up to maximum. Wow what a difference from all previous cordless phones.Incidentally, the AT&T; 6.0 boasts in writing, on the box, to have the best range of any cordless phone due to a unique antenna design. I believe that the Panasonic 6.0 range is just as good, judging by the reviews. However only the AT&T; 6.0 puts such a claim in writing."
1,"Unreliable, strange decrease in range after couple of months","I spent an incredible amount of time reading reviews before I bought this phone and should have actually paid attention to the bad ones. I was very happy with the phones when I first purchased them--great clarity, range was comparable to what I had before, good battery life, good price, etc. Now having owned them for a couple of months I find that they are dropping calls for no apparent reason. I had seen reviews in which people reported problems that only began after a few months and thought they had to have been a fluke but now it has happened to me too."
4,panasonic phone system ok,I put these phones into use and find that they are working very well. I would recommend them.
2,This is my second set of Panasonic phones that doesn't work,"I've long relied on Panasonic phones, but the last two sets (within a year!) have been a complete bust. This one just drops out calls all the time! I will have to switch to a new system--these just aren't reliable anymore. I don't know what's happened to their quality control."
2,Highly Disappointed,After reading other reviews on this phone I decided to buy. I wish I hadn't. You can be standing next to the base (less than two Feet) and the phone won't work and displays a message that I'm to for away. Sometimes you'll be in the middle of a conversation and phone disconnects. I have had much success with previous Panasonic phones but they can have these back!!!!!
4,Very Satisfied,"I live in a small apartment in New York and have had trouble with the reception on most cordless phones I've owned. I am happy to say that since buying this phone, I've had absolutely no problem whatsoever. It doesn't matter that the base is sitting in an area between my microwave and a computer. No reception problems at all. The battery has also not died on me yet. My child is always leaving the phones off of the base, yet when we go to make a call, the dial tone is still there. I absolutely love the speakerphone. It's like the person is sitting in the room next to you. The only negative I've found is the conference call feature. I can pick up my extension while someone else is on the phone and listen in without them knowing. My child has done that to me a couple of times. There should be a way to give permission before someone joins in the conversation. Other than that, I love the phone and highly recommend it to others."
3,Poor sound quality,"I have owned the phone a little over a month and have always had inconsistent sound quality. This is with each of the handsets, and very close to the base. The rest of the phone seems good, and you don't need to register each hand set with the base as I did with an earlier Panasonic phone. The phone is compact and has a small footprint.I have rated it three stars because the phone would be five stars if the sound quality was good."
3,Not as per reviews for me,"I moved to this from Siemens 4105 - after 6 happy years. This one doesn't last as long, range is about half.But just this phone by itself.. pretty good for the price, features and all."
2,Don't use with MagicJack,I spent three hours with MagicJack trying to get the caller id for this phone to work. I later called Panasonic and they advised that this feature does not work with MagicJack. I replace the phone with a Motorola phone and the caller id worked fine. Panasonic also advised that this is a problem with many of their phones. Don't buy if you are using MagicJack.
4,almost perfect,"Compared to the GE set of phones we had before, these Panasonic units are far superior. We can actually use them outside and in our garage without being drowned out by static and they have a decent range, although NOT the 1,000 yards that the literature promises.I can actually sit in front of my computer, directly under a florescent light, and have no static. This is really great!We don't keep our phones off of their chargers long enough for us to know how long the charge lasts, but it does last longer than a one hour phone call to an old friend.The worst thing about them is that you have to hold them ""just so"" to hear, and the ""just so"" is almost straight horizontal rather than up and down. If they are tilted slightly wrong it is almost impossible to hear.But for the price they are a very good deal indeed."
4,Nice phone.,This seems to be a pretty good phone. I like the design. It has some really nice ring tones. The battery life and range are great. The only things I don't like is the sound can be a bit tinny and it's not really loud enough when you use a headset for the person on the other end. It does not display the time. I don't know why they even bother to have a time setting feature on it. I have not tried the answering machine yet or the alarm. I may write more about it later after I've used it for a while.
4,Good Quality Phone,"Good phone. I really only needed a phone with good sound and good battery life. This phone has both. The only thing I wish it had is a little better grip on the back where you hold it. Its a little bit slippery, but that is not a big deal. I also like the larger buttons than our previous panasonic phone. It makes it easier for my kids to dial too."
1,Voice Mail alert N/G,"Flashing voice mail signal and screen msg will not work, although they did on my last Panasonic phone. Panasonic says this phone requires FSK signal from phone company. Verizon says they can only send stutter tone signal, not FSK (Frequency Shift Key). In spite of this, Panasonic claims that ""all of our phones are compatible with all phone company networks"". Sorry to do so, but sent it back. Panasonic didn't respond when asked for other model #s which WILL work with stutter tone."
2,You get what you pay for..,"I bought this item so I could set the Base station in my house and set the other handsets in my garage, upstairs and downstairs. The base unit is 30 feet away and I constantly drop calls due to out of range. and 2 of the phones go dead after using the phones for several minutes.I thought I was buying a reputable product...But I was wrong!!!"
3,Needs better battery life,"Bought this in December, 2007. I've been happy with the purchase until the past few months when the battery in 2 of the 3 phones started to fail. One phone won't hold a charge at all; another will only support a call of 30 minutes without a recharge. In full disclosure, I have an older set made by Uniden which was even worse than this one. Not sure what the gold standard is for battery life but I think that it should be longer than this under mild-use conditions. I question whether it makes sense to pay $15-20 for new batteries at this point.I don't use the answering system since I have VM through Verizon.I'd also like to see one button to view Caller ID history instead of having to go through a couple of menus.Sound quality, range and style were all very good."
3,Decent phone system but would buy something else next time,"These phones work as advertised but I will spend more money for a better set in the future. It's a little cumbersome going through the menu system and the batteries don't last as long as I would like. Basically, I got what I paid for and it was a good price."
4,Very good phone system,"I've had this phone system for a year now and am very satisfied. It replaced a Uniden system which I liked but whose failed proprietary batteries would have cost more to replace than buying a new system. The standard AAA rechargeable batteries on this Panasonic are still going strong.Range is excellent, battery life is excellent and sound quality is good. The only downside I've found to these phones (as other reviewers have reported) is Panasonic's very poor menus."
2,Not much better,"I bought these phones in hopes that there would be NO static when talking on the phone. Well I was wrong, they are just a little bit better then the cheap Uniden phones I gave away. The price on these was right but I'm not at all impressed. Hate the buzzinnnnnnnnnnn sound."
2,Worthless,"This phone is supposed to have the clearest signal there is, and, for me, it works only when you're standing next to the base. Troubleshooting says to move the base somewhere that is away from electronic devices--TVs, computers, cell phones, etc. I ask you where, in an American household, can you find a space that isn't next to some electronic device? I've talked to other people who own this phone, and they say it's fine. But it isn't for me. I had to remove the two extra handsets, since no one who called could hear me talking over either of them."
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 3 Handset Cordless Phone System with Answering System,[[ASIN:B000LYAX1G Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 3 Handset Cordless Phone System with Answering System (KX-TG1033S)]Phones shipped well and fast. Very good sound quality and are used with magicjack internet service.The recommended headset doesn't work well at all. I haven't found a headset to work with these yet which is my preferred method for any long conversation. The intercom feature works great. I would recommend these phones to friends.
5,"Good quality, easy to use",I ordered this telephone/answering machine with multiple handsets to replace an older Panasonic model and I am very pleased with the sound quality and ease of use. I never learned how to use all the special features on my old phone but this one is much more user-friendly.
3,Nice Phone - best in years But...,I bought 2 kx-TG1033s and linked them all to one base. The sound quality is great. Finally a phone that works with my computer network and has the range to go all over my house (upstairs and downstairs). I love the intercomm feature. The positives written here are true.BUT.. the speaker phone is useless for others to hear clearly. It drops words if your not right on top of the phone. The caller ID takes a long time to show-up if it every does before 4 rings (seems to be for calls not in your directory). This caller id feature worked better before we started adding alot of our phone numbers into it. I really would like the buttons to be backlit.
2,not as good as expected,"received these phones about 3 weeks ago and already have had problems with them. they do not hold a charge as stated they barely hold a charge as long as a regular cordless phone and by no means for 17 hours of talk time, maybe 2. the reception on one of the phones is marred by a constant buzz in the background making it barely able to use. when i go to the panasonic website to troubleshoot there is nowhere to troubleshoot as stated in the handbook. so you are left calling panasonic. so good luck with yours."
3,Great Sound Quality...nothing else,"Basic phone. Other than the exceptional sound quality, it has nothing else to offer other than being a basic phone. One bad thing is that when the phone rings, the buttons do not light up as my last phone did. Very hard to find the ""talk"" button when you get a call in the middle of the night...But I still cannot get over the sound quality and I have had this phone for 5 months!"
3,A bit quality issue,It did not take too long for us to eliminate one. The quality seems to need improvement. Likely I won't get a smilar one to replace the current.
1,Worked for a few months,"This product, after a few months, garbled words. It did not last very long, it was great for a few months and then malfunctioned"
5,Panasonic Phone,"This phone system is great! I like the fact that you can hear your messages from any handset. Also when one person picks up one handset, another person can pick up another handset and talk too. The speaker phone feature has a good sound quality and the phone itself has great sound and range. The price and quality make this a very good buy."
4,Great Phone,"After reading many reviews on this product, and others, I decided to give it a try. So far I have loved it! It doesn't interfere with my wireless internet. It goes as far as I have needed it to. It doesn't sound fuzzy or like you are in a tunnel. It is clear and sounds great. There are a lot of steps to delete the missed calls and messages (from the handset), but it is not that big of a deal. The pros definitely outway the cons."
3,Disappointed,"After significant research, much of which was based upon customer reviews, we purchased the Panasonic KX-TG1033S phone. We have been using them for a week or two and I am very disappointed with the sound quality. There is a continual fade in and out of the person on the other end. It is completely annoying. Some other features the phones are lacking has pushed us to return the phones. As many other reviewers mentioned, the menu system is just not user friendly. The answering system cannot be played on the base if the handset is not in the cradle. Since ours is never in the cradle I have to search it out before I can hear the messages. The answering system does not indicate the number of new messages.One big positive is the battery life. We have never owned a phone that had such a long battery life. Unfortunately this isn't enough for us to keep the phones."
5,A Great Phone for a Great Price,"For the past 20 something years I owned cordless phones. I never had luck with any of them, until now. This phone works great. The battery power lasts for hours, it is clear as day,its comfortable and simple to use. I highly recommend this phone to anyone in the market for a cordless with an answering machine."
5,Works Very Well,"This product is a big improvement over our last phone system. It works very well. The sound is clear, it has good range, the buttons are easy to see and push, the speaker phone is amazing, the handsets are ergonomically designed, and the price is right. We are very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Product,Easy to use and set up. Batteries in phones are standard Ni-H AAA's so changing to new batteries will be a snap. Panasonic claims the phones will not overcharge sitting in the charger. 17 hour rated talk time.
1,They don't make them like they used to,"If you are looking for a cordless phone that is easy to navigate and setup, isn't ""too"" small so it's easy to cradle and dial one-handed, has good sound on both the receiver and answering machine, this is the phone for you.If you are looking for a cordless phone that has any kind of range, look elsewhere. I thought I remember reading some reviews where they said the range got better the more you used it and recharged this phone..... I can't get it to pick up when I'm outside unless I'm on the same side of the building the base is on. And my old Radio Shack cheapo has this one beat hands down in that dept.I have tried different makes, digital vs analog, different frequencies and have come to the conclusion that they just don't have the same range that they used to. I like that it comes with beltclips, though.... all cordless phones should IMO."
3,cordless phone,The 2 substations did not come with chargers and this was not evident to me when the purchase was made.
4,Good but...,"I really like the phone, no issues with reception distance or interference. The only issue that I have is with the answering system. It doesn't show how many new messages there are and it doesn't have any visual cue at all that there old messages to listen to. Also, it just blinks that there is a new message. My old machine had a beep as well which I liked. Other than this, it is a great phone system. I really enjoy all the other features, intercom being one of them."
3,"Great phone, but may not work with Verizon",I really liked this phone except that I never could get the Voice Mail visual indicator to work. By this I mean that I have Voice Mail via my telephone company and wanted to have a visual indication that I had voice mail as the phone is supposed to do. Panasonic tech support told me to have my phone company turn on FSK (frequency shift key). Verizon said that both the audio and visual indicators were on but it still didn't work. Panasonic tech support said to have my phone company turn the audio signal off because it was interfering with the visual indicator on the phone. This didn't work and now I lost the audio signal telling me I had voice mail. I returned the phone and bought a Uniden DECT 6.0. Guess what - no visual indication also!!! It seems that these new DECT 6.0 phones require a visual indicator signal that Verizon does not provide. So beware of DECT 6.0 phones if you really want this.
5,Excellent!,"This phone is great! We can hear the answering system through the handsets, if we are in another room. Can also check and delete messages, from any handset. Has quite a few fun ring tones to choose from. Has excellent sound. And the battery lasts a good long time! We are extremely happy with this product!!"
5,Great phones,Have only been using these for a week but so far they're performing very nicely. Very easy to set up.
4,Solid phones,"Likes: sound quality, ability to share address books, range, battery life.Dislikes: dropped calls at extreme of range, no battery back up.Overall I'm pleased with these phones. Sound quality is my No. 1 criterion and it's quite good with these units -- a thousand times better than the AT&T; 5.8 ghz phones I recently returned.Range is also good, being slightly better than my old 2.8 ghz Siemens and the aforementioned AT&T.; The one caveat is that these phones will actually drop calls when they are at their limit, whereas the others would simply show degraded sound quality. But for that I'd give them a five."
5,Excelent..,I'm from Venezuela. This phone is better than the other phones you find here. It has a lot of useful functions.
4,Good but . . .,I like the everything about the new phones EXCEPT one of the reasons I purchased them is so I could purchase additional phones to add on to them. But it costs almost as much for one additional phone as it did for the three!
4,great reception & easy to use,I have a wireless router a few feet away from the base phone and i have never gotten interference. Also i live in a four story building in NYC and the phone worked on the roof. the base is on the first floor.Best reception ive ever gotten on a cordless.and three units is a nice number to have. comes in very handy.Also very easy to set up phone book and automatically transfer numbers to other handsets. decent speaker phone too.
5,Practical phone option,"Rather than dealing with satilite wiring, this system is a whiz to connect up and use. The digital screen helps out with knowing who is calling."
5,Great phone,I have awlways thought Panasonic made the best. So I purchased this set for an elderly lady to replace an older unit. She loves it and thinks it is the greatest. I was surprised when she wanted one in the bathroom. Never thought of that. Would highly reccommend this unit.
5,Meets our needs,"The Panasonic Dect 6.0 system has been a great asset to our home. Easy to set up, continuous features to all phones, dependable service. It has been perfect for our situation."
5,I Really Like These Phones,"I'm not much for writing reviews but I like this phone so much that I culdn't resist to let others know. The buttons are easy to use, the read out is good size, easy to see and the features are easy to follow - all important items for the 60+ set. The quality is what you'd expect from Panasonic. The only thing I wished it did was send out a tone to let you know you had new messages. Aside from that, if you're on the fence, get this modle."
5,Great Quality,"I researched a lot of phone systems and this one kept coming up on top. I bought this phone system as a gift for my parents. They had gone through many that were cheaply made and poor quality. Now I can hear them no matter where they are in their home. It is easy for them to use. They both love it. Bonus, my Dad is able to hear with his hearing aid. All in all a great gift for them and they love it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality phone system."
5,comparable,"I wanted a phone much like the Uniden that I am replacing. The reason I pulled away from Uniden was that I have high cheek bones and I would constantly disconnect people because of where Uniden had their disconnect key. It was a joke, that whenever I called someone that I would hang up on them. (That joke got old)The two phones were comparable - if you do not have high cheek bones you may wish to get the Uniden because it is a bit more programably friendly. Probably because I just got used to it. Uniden's battery never wore down for me, the Panasonic has once already. They are pretty much alike, I am happy with what Panasonic and Uniden are doing with phones. Keep up the good work."
2,Panasonic DECT 6.0-Series 3-Handset Cordless Phone System with Answering System (KX-TG1033S),I had to end up returning this phone because it wouldn't work in all of the areas in my house (2800 Sq ft). The sound quality was poor as well.
4,Great Product,"It is a great product at a great price. I would recommend it to a friend.It has user friendly menus. Great sound. Good battery life. It has fallen quite a number of times and has not broken. I only gave it four stars because of some minor issues: 1. If you don't pick up phone until after the answering machine picked up it often keeps that answering machine running and records the whole conversation, and 2. It sometimes does have reception at some far extremes of the house (I have a large house), 3. So far I have not been able to figure out how to delete messages when dialing in from an external phone (Ps. when reviewing messages from one of the cordless phone, you can delete the message by pressing the clear button. I did not see this in the instruction manual.)."
3,Cordless phones don't have great range,The panasonic cordless phone do fine on everything except the range. Problems occur 50ft from the house. Our old Vtech phones had a range of over 200ft from house.
3,Panasonic Cordless phone,"Phones have good range but sometimes sound as if they cut out sometimes (but really have not), causing you to ask ""can you hear me now""?"
1,terrible phones,Will return phones for the following reasons: Dropped calls. Echoes. Sometimes can't even receive calls. Will return phones. Very poor quality.
4,Pana Cordless,"Mostly great. The volume issue seems to me to be that your ear has to be at a very specific position to hear well. Great to have standard AAA rechargable batteries! The only annoyance is that when we answer with our other Uniden phone, the Panasonic counts it as a missed call."
4,works like a charm!,The setup and use was easy - the voice is so much better than the previous 5.8 GHz that I had before. and all at a very reasonable price.
3,frustrating,"Although overall the set works well, we find it frustrating that the phones record and list all calls as MISSED CALLS, even though we answer them. This results in having to manually delete every call from the caller ID log in order to reset to zero. Also not very pleased with the functioning of the phones as it relates to the distance from their base. I lose signal even while within our home, and definitely when outside on our patio."
3,Phones,They were nice phones but the volume would not turn up high i would not buy these phones but usually Panasonic has good products !
2,The answering machine on the base unit broke after three months,"I was delighted with this system at first, until the answering machine on the base unit starting blinking and quit working.Now my phone rings just 4 times in my home, and the answering machine does not pick up. To the caller it sounds like it just rings forever. I can't put a new answering machine in because the old one does something after 4 rings.I can't send the base unit in for repairs because none of the other phones will work while it is gone.I am currently spending time trying to find out what to do.We really like the phones other than this problem. The intercom system is great, sound is good, and speaker phones work well. The menu is a bit cumbersome but it works."
1,A lot of static - very disappointed,"I am so disappointed with this phone. I did a lot of research before buying this at the beginning of January and this one kept coming out on top. It has gotten overwhelming positive reviews so I decided to buy it. From day one the static has been awful, to the point where I've had to end calls because I couldn't hear the other person. I've moved the base away from all electronic devices and the static still continues. Since I'm still within the 30 day period this is going back and I'll go back to the drawing board on researching another phone."
2,Not long range as stated...,"Clarity is very good; however, I could go much further with my 5.8 than I can with this. With this I am limited to about 50 feet from the base and that's not far at all."
5,great value,"I bought this phone a month ago, got an awesome deal on it.It is very easy to use and you can store 50 phone numbersin it. Plus you can access your messages from any handset.I would definitely recommend this phone."
2,Affordable but watch out for the range and voice quality. Try KX-TG6424T instead,"I am very happy with the ordering and shipping process but very disappointed with the range and voice quality. It is sad to see Panasonic has a product like this. I live in a 1600 sq ft townhouse, the conversation keeps breaking. I install the base station in my bedroom(2nd floor) and make call from family room(first floor). The other end of the call keeps asking me to repeat myself. Even if I move to closer to the base, the improvement is marginal. I tried for a few days and gave up. I went to Costco to buy the 4 phone pack model(KX-TG6424T) and install phones at the same locations, it is a different experience completely. The phone has a better make quality and feel better. Voice quality and range are excellent. But I have to say Amazon return experience is like a breeze."
4,Awesome phone!,"I am VERY HAPPY with this phone/ answering machine! This is actually the best cordless phone i've ever had and would highly recommend it to anyone. I only have one minor complaint which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It does not have a lighted keypad. So if you're trying to use it when the lights are turned off you cannot see what buttons to push. Other than that the sound quality is great, it feels nice to hold and to talk on and it looks really nice. I bought this to replace another Panasonic cordless phone that was old and this phone blows my old one away! I would absolutely buy this again if I was going to buy another phone."
3,Panasonic DECT 6.0 phone,"So far, I really like this phone. My one issue with it is that there seems to be a very limited ""sweet spot"" where you can hear the other party clearly. If you move the handset from that sweet spot, you can't hear the other party to whom you are talking clearly. I have not yet tried the range of the phone, because my home is small and I haven't taken the phone outside. Also, I attempted to record some music in the background when I recorded my answering machine message, and the music sounds completely tinny while the spoken words came out very clear."
3,Returning the phone- can't wall mount it,"I specifically bought this phone with the intention of using it mounted on the wall in my kitchen. However, the wall mount adapter is a strange design that keeps the base horizontal and puts the phone handset up too high so that it cannot fit on the wall jack underneath my cabinets. You can't use this as a wall mount phone unless you have a lot of clearance above your wall jack."
4,good purchase,"good phones with clear sound quality. intercom/pager feature is nice to call someone else in same house. the caller id menu could be easier to navigate, but nonetheless these phones are a good purchase for the price."
5,Corded quality without a cord,"After purchasing a new wireless router for our home network, we noticed our cordless phones cut in and out. The Panasonic had the Dect 6.0 technology, and the sound quality was as good as a corded phone. The menu system uses a lot of keystrokes, but is OK once you get used to it. If filled our need 100%."
4,multi-phones,I bought this product having purchased several Panasonic phones-answering machines in the past. My former phones let me wander over my 3500 sq ft house and worke everywhere. I expected to be able to put the base unit in a central location and use the satalite units anywhere in the house. I could not use them that way. The the units cannot be more than about 50 feet away from the base unit and still communicate. The units work fine but have to be a bit close for my house.
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"While highly rated, this phone does not live up to expextations. The extension downstairs in our house often is ""lost"" and cand't find it's base. We have moved it several times to no avail.Also, there is not an adequate notification system when we have voice mail from our local phone serivce...no flashing lights, etc. The script notiifying us that we have a message is small and dark. Not as good as the old Panasonic that this one replaced."
5,Great phone with great price,"This review (Panasonic 1.9 GHz DECT 6.0) is based on my existing Panasonic 5.8 GHz phone which also works great. I also love them because of their size and comfortable while holding. Sound quality is amazingly clear. Some other reviewers have complained about this DECT 6.0 phone for their range, but when I compared with my existing 5.8 GHz Panasonic phone they match exactly. Also, it has bigger buttons which makes convenient to dial. It's a very highly recommended cordless phone.Pros: Comfortable, easy-to-use, large-button handset, excellent sound quality, backlit LCD on handset, speakerphone on handset, menu options easy to configure, 17 hours talk time with 7.5 days battery life, AAA rechargeable (so easily available) battery, easy copying of phonebook to all other handsets, and many more.Cons: Missing button light, talking caller ID, slow talk or voice enhancing options like some other expensive Panasonic phones have(which I don't care)."
1,on my 2nd set of phones in 6 months - pure garbage,I am on my second set and everything breaks on it. The battery still says need to charge for 7 hours after i charged it the whole night
3,Newer technology is not always better!!,"For the most part, the phone works well. Large numbers on the handset are helpful, but a backlit number display would have been a good feature. However there are some negatives. The display recently indicated that the phone needed to be ""re-registered"" again for no apparent reason. After going through the process of registering it again, the phone was out of order for several hours until the battery was recharged as well. I don't know how often this is going to happen. I also find that attempting to retrieve or delete ""missed"" calls is not as user friendly as my previous phone system (Uniden)because the navigator key that controls the feature is very sensitive and requires several steps to complete."
5,Good Phone - Its a Panasonic,"There's not much to say really, its a Panasonic. I have had previous versions of this phone and the biggest improvement that I see is that it does not have the antenna stubs, which used to break on the previous generations. It works well with Vonage too."
5,What a Bargin,This was a better than expected purchase. After reviewing other opinions I purchased this phone.It has more than surpassed my expectations.Easy set up...Ease of use...and I love being able to hear a message when cloe to any of the handsets. The intercome is a bonus for my husband and I. I highly recommend this phone.
5,Excellent Product Well Priced!,I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Amazon has excellent service and fast shipping. The battery life is long and the handsets are not heavy at all for a cordless phone. Great range and good selection of ring tones. Handset to handset paging is a nice feature.
4,Great phone set,"Works well. Picks up a good signal from anyway in the house. I like the compactness with the answering machine, etc."
4,Great value for the money!!!,Good sound quality and reasonable range. Works within about 250 feet of base unit. Phone features are easy to use.My only disppointments are:-No speaker in the main base unit.-Key pad does not illuminate at night.-So far I've not found a setting adjustment to turn off or tone down the amber charging light at the top of the phone when it's in the charging unit.-The default diplay tells you how many call's you've missed. I'd rather see the time of day.
5,Great cordless phone set,"This set works sooo much better than my last one. No interference, I can hear clearly and that is what I was looking for."
4,"Good Phone, but not great","I like the phone, and would have given it 5 stars if you could increase the volume more on the handsets. Also, navigating through the various functions on the phone takes a little getting used to, and is not especially user friendly. Otherwise, I think it's a good value."
2,Disappointed,"I've read the reviews and I thought that it has to be a good phone, so I gave a try, I did not like them because firt of all I hear like an eco, and weak signal, but there are other people said that it work very good for them.Send it back, Amazon is a great company, the refund was so fast.and fair."
1,range is terrible,"This is the poorest range phone I have ever purchased.I do not have a large house and the base has to be located in the center of the house to get reception inside the house. If the base is just 13 feet from the end of the house, it will not work in the bedroom just 24 feet away. It will not work outside at all. My older phone would get reception up to 150+ feet out in the yard.I emailed customer service and got no customer service and no recommendations."
1,Off hook handset cannot be located!,"This seemed like a nice phone, but we lost a handset that was off hook. The locator function DOES NOT WORK for phones that are off hook. I tried the ""deregister handset"" function in desperation, but it didn't work either.Ultimately we found the handset by searching (the phone system didn't help a bit).Not being able to locate a missing handset, when its been off hook for hours, is unacceptable and I would never buy this product again!"
1,not worth the money,This phone has given me trouble from the first use. The voice cuts in and out on EVERY phone call. It sounds as if the person is speaking through a tunnel. I do not recommend this product.
2,No audible message tone! UNBELIEVABLE!,"Others have provided good feedback on this system, but I don't think anyone mentioned what I consider its fatal flaw - THE BASE DOESN'T BEEP WHEN YOU HAVE MESSAGES! I don't think I have ever bought a phone machine that didn't have an audible indicator. On this system, the only way to know you have messages is if you look at a headset, or the base, and notice it's blinking. I don't know about you, but when I get home, I generally have a million things to do, and glancing at my phones usually isn't one of them. I bought these after returning another system (Vtech) that was great except that the handsets didn't have headset jacks. WHAT ARE THESE MANUFACTURERS THINKING? If you have no problem remembering to check for messages, this system might suit you just fine. But if you depend on that little beep, keep on looking."
4,Very pleased with package of three.,"Very pleased with this phone system. Since I plugged it in, it has been easy to use, program and works wonderfully. Linking your phonebook to the other handsets is simple and easy. The sound quality is excellent. I like the fact the phone handsets are interchangeable. With three teenagers you never know where they are going to end up."
5,Great phone,"The Panasonic Dect 6.0 phone is great. The sound is very clear and background noise is gone. The phone has lots of great features one of the best is the phonebook where you only have to enter the information into one phone then transfer it to the others, many ring tones to choose from."
2,Long range? Not!,"I did a lot of research prior to buying this item, looking for a phone that would give me extended range. Many reviewers commented on the excellent range of this item, so I purchased it. My second handset now sits on a kitchen counter less than 40 feet from the base unit, just off a direct line of sight. Almost every time I pick it up, I have to walk towards the base unit in order for the handset to make contact with the base. I am extremely unhappy with this purchase - maybe I just got a lemon and the other reviewers are right, but my phone does not work as advertised.Update: After using this phone system for a few weeks, I hate it even more than I did at first. If Amazon allowed it, I would definately change my rating to one star rather than the two stars I originally gave it. The range is HORRIBLE! And, the ringer now is one long continuous ring the doesn't stop until you answer the phone. This system is JUNK!"
4,Good phone reception at a good price,"Replacing my Uniden cordless set after callers complained about the sound quality, I chose this Panasonic set, and I am pleased. The sound quality is great, and I especially like the various ring tones that are available. I have different phone sets programmed to ring at various volumes, depending on the room they are located in, and that works well.If you are looking for a replacement set, this one is great. It only comes with 3 handsets, my Uniden had 4 but I really don't miss the 4th one."
4,"So far, very nice phones","Not much that I want to say other than we have been very happy with these phones. I bought them several months ago and they have performed without flaw. Battery performance is great, the menu items for setting up my preferences are easy to understand and follow,and the range has not been a problem"
2,phone review,"the phone is great, logical user interface, sounds clear--- all of this is very good.the bad is the answering machine does not 'hear' or recognize cell phone DTMF (the number button sounds). This means that you cannot access your messages remotely from your cell phone. You can access them from a land line, but guess what? When I travel, I would call into the house via my cell phone!!so I am back to using teh sevice provider voicemail with the monthly fee.not happy, buy another product, not this one."
1,The Phone from Hell !!,The Panasonic DECT phones are a disaster. Each time the phone rings it kills XBOX 360 Wireless connections and interrupts wired DSL connections even. It causes interruptions with VPN software causing multiple application crashes. In addition after 2 months the speaker phone comes on and can not be turned off. To make it worse it comes thru as a shorted buzzing connection. This is the phone from hell. Panasonic will not respond to my inquiries. One star is rating it way too high.
3,Panasonic Kx-TG1033 s Dect. 6.0,"I bought Panasonic TX-TG1033S recently, I did not use it that much and so far everything is fine, but I found out that this Dect. 6.0 has over max. radiation which is not healthy for human body. I am not using them as my original plan, but I wish I knew it before. I will let you know if something get wrong with it!"
2,Poor Reception & Answerer Quality etc,"The overall quality of the reception on the handsets was very poor. Mainly, due to not being able to get that far from the base unit before voice reception broke-up and became staticy. The quality of the answering machine was poor. I made the announcement, time and time again, and the recording always sounded muffled and difficult to understand. I'm not sure why they call it a 6.0 DECT when it operates in the 1.9GHz frequency range. I suspect this is what the cause of the inferior reception and the limited distance from the base you experience, when you notice the quality drop-off. I have a GE 6.0 DECT cordless phone system that is in the same cost area, that I would highly recommend over this unit. Save your time and frustration. JMO"
3,Not so audible?,"I presented to my dad. Based on his comments, he says voice is not so audible. Otherwise he says there is nothing complaint about the phone."
3,Nothing special (Panasonic KX-TG1033S),"I purchased this phone for the Dect 6 feature since I have WiFi. The phone works fine, but I can't go too far from the base without losing the signal. The battery life is average. Plenty of features for the price. Sound quality is also average. Not as good as the 5.8 Ghz Panasonic I replaced."
4,"Good phone, weird mount & menus","The phone is great -- good batter, excellent sound quality, doesn't fight with my wifi network. The menus are a little awkward, but servicible, and the wall mount is a little strange -- it kind of sticks out on a bit of a pedestal.Works well, no problems though which is the biggest part"
2,Disappointed,"My husband bought this phone for me after our 15-yr old phone finally died. I was excited to have caller i.d. for once. However, this phone is disappointing. When I'm on another line and get a second call, no number displays to let me know who's interrupting the call. The volume doesn't go very loud. And throughout the course of a conversation, there will be a clearness in the quality of the call and then a muffled, still period which, at first, had me asking, ""Are you still there?"" I'm used to that happening now, but leaves me very disappointed.The pros: it's a phone. It has caller i.d. on the first incoming call. We have three phones throughout the house now.The cons: the overall quality of the call experience is poor; volume is poor; and you're unable to view the numbers of incoming calls when you're already on a call.I don't recommend this phone."
3,The good and the bad,"This is a great phone. Love the extra handsets. The sound is so crisp and the handsets feel solid, not like you're holding a toy.But, the range is so short. And is DOES interfere with Internet connection. If I use the phone near the computer, I have an intermittent connection and when I hang up, I lose all connection to the Internet for about 60 seconds.Not as good as I had hoped, but better than what I had before!"
3,I like this phone,"This phone is fine. I had an older version of he Panasonic that I really liked. The menu controls are a little less user friendly on the new one -- particularly viewing previous calls. The answering machine blinks when you have a message instead of showing the number so if you've listened to them, but want to go back there isn't a visual to remind you. I ended up using the answering machine from the old one and just using the new one for the phone cababilitiesThe quality of the phone is fine. The range is about equal to what I had previously which disappointed me some I was hoping for a greater range with the updated phone.The three phones is a nice plus. All in all it serves my needs well."
4,Good phone,"Good product, good buy... Recommend it; it has good call quality and reception, range is average but enough for a medium house."
4,Phones are good; menu system takes a bit of getting used to,"The phones themselves are great - good range, great sound, etc.However - the menu system on the phone isn't quite as intuitive as it could be. For example, if you turn on Speakerphone using the 'SP-Phone' button, to get back to talking through the handset, you have to hit 'Talk' again - on previous phones, I could just hit the 'SP-Phone' button to disable it.Once you get used to it, however, it works great!"
5,nice clear sound,"I've been very pleased with the phones. The sound is very clear; no static. It's great to be able to see whether I have a phone service voice message without having to pick up the phone. It has a lot of features, such as intercom and the answering machine that I haven't had to use yet."
5,Excellent Phone,"I bought this based on the reviews that I read and have no regrets. I give them two thumbs up....way up. Excellent phones and no static. Buy them, its a good product."
4,So Far So Good,"It sure is hard to find decent cordless phones. Usually Panasonic phones have good sound quality and their wired phones are pretty much the best. The fidelity and sound quality on this phone is quite good. The wireless reception is solid. My biggest complaint is the interface, while the buttons are a comfortable size the navigation through the features is a big wacky. Panasonic should study human factors engineering with Sony or Apple. I think this is a pretty good deal. I left out the speakerphone on the handset...it works really well even though they placed the removable belt clip right over the speaker."
4,Great phones,"Have been using for about a month - mostly satisfied. Quick response time for buttons (was a problem with my last AT&T phones), no static. Comfortable to use, lightweight, nice big buttons. Minor issues - phonebook doesn't transfer between headsets (must program each one), get an occasional strange sound (dead silence - like it disconnected my call) even though it hasn't and the person on the other end notices nothing. Caller ID takes more clicks than I think it should. Despite these minor things, I'd buy again."
5,great phone,"The Panaxonic KX-TG1033S works very well with no detectable interference from other electrical devices. The numbers on the pads are large, making them easily visible. With caller recognition service, the caller names also are easily read."
4,Great phone system,"This telephone is extremely clear,when using for local or long distance calls. None of that interference noise. Once set up, it is easy to use. The only draw back is finding the ""Talk"" button when answering the phone. Other than that it is the BEST phone system I ever had."
4,panphones,Phones work fine. No interference observed. However the phone could be improved with a screen readout and the ability to increase the volume a little more.
4,So Far So Good,"I really like the quality so far. Once you hook up the main phone to your phone source the other 2 receivers need NO wiring which is a huge plus. I was pleasantly surprise how easy it was to hook up the 3 phones. Great device, I hope it has good longevity. Rechargeable batteries included BIG +. The only con is the receivers feel a little light which I hope doesn't = cheap quality."
3,Range was not great!,"Our house is on the larger size at 4300 square feet, and we have used other Panasonic Phones in the past, with no problem on the range... The main receiver was in our kitchen, and when we tried using it in the Master BR, the line would cut out, or it would say there was no signal...... Also, one of the handsets would ring, one solid ring in our upstairs loft. After some research online, I purchased one of the Uniden phones, which was $20.00 more from best Buy, but I have not had any problems, and LOVE IT..Hope this helpsbb"
3,No Range to Speak of,"I like the answering machine. The design of phone, features and ease of use are fine. My BIG beef is the lack of RANGE. The base is in the office and another is one room away. Half the time I am told I'm too far away from the base. If the battery is fully charged it may work okay. I ended up digging up my old Sony cordless and buying a new battery for it so I'd for sure to have a reliable one in a third room."
4,A wellthought out product,"I recently purchased the Panasonic Cordless Answering System, Model No. kx-tg1031. I needed a phone that wouldn't interfere with my work on my laptop. This phone set does almost all the things I needed from a phone--ease of use, for example: the operating instructions were clear, much easier to follow than any other cordless phone I've ever owned--all one of them, a phone I bought at Radio Shack. I was able to start using it as soon as the battery loaded. I haven't had the phone long enough to comment on the battery life. The only problem I haven't been able to solve is to get rid of the ""missed call"" message on the Display. I am, otherwise, more than satisfied with the product."
3,It's good.,"I have other versions of this phone in the 5.8ghz range. The 6.0ghz range does not go as far outside the house as my other phone and it has this weird effect when you are talking it goes in and out of having ""background noise"" to dead silence where you think the other end has hung up or been disconnected (messes with your mind)"
4,Great phone,"I bought this phone for my parents since they are notorious for destroying phones. However, I must say this phone is easy to use and the reception is great. My parents are enjoying the phone and are having fun playing with all its features. So far I have no complaints from them. Personally, I have the V-TECH phones but if/when those phones go bad, I will certainly consider getting this phone."
1,Extremely POOR Phonebook Memory Capability,"You can not use the 0-9 keypad to access more than the first 9 numbers you enter. You have to manually go through all the numbers to get to the number you want. This is really stupid!!!!! and annoying, now I've got to repackage this piece of junk and start over looking for a decent phone. Also, even at the highest setting the volume is a little low..."
3,Pansonic is surely overrated,Charged battery don't last as claimed. Other than that its a decent phone but little overpriced because of brand.
2,Poor voice quality,The sets give a very annoying hum feedback that exists no matter where the handset(s)is used. This is disappointing since the other reviews do not mention this. I'll have to buy some other system in the near future.
4,Works as it should,"I bought the Panasonic KX-TG1033S with DECT after some research, and the other reviews are pretty much on target. The volume is a little low, but the range and clarity seem to be pretty good. For some reason I'm having a hard time getting it to accept a time input."
3,Panasonic DECT 6.0 phone,"We have used this phone for a couple of weeks now. We are very pleased with the ability to hear the messages being left, from any of the handsets. It is great to be upstairs and be able to hear who is calling. The one thing I don't like about it is the volume on the base unit. I have turned it up all the way and it is hard to hear the message that is being left, if you are not close by. The base unit is more horizontal than vertical, so it sticks out a bit from the wall. It is in our kitchen and where it is on the wall, it is hard to see if there is a message.Overall we are very pleased. I think we would buy it again."
5,Believe,When in need of a multi phone system I thoroughly read the reviews and came up with the fact that this is perhaps the best in the market at this price range. I was skeptical but since using it for 4 weeks I am totally impressed with the clarity of sound as well as with all of the great features it offers. I wish I had this system years ago.
2,Two out of three handsets bad,"Panasonic KX-TG1033S Dect 6.0 Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System with 3 HandsetsThe phone replaces a Panasonic 5.8GHz phone that worked perfectly in the same location. Handset #1 keeps contact with the base station no matter where I walk on my property. Handset #2 cuts out in the kitchen. Handset #3 cuts out outside the back door. Too bad I have to return it. It has nice features but I don't have confidence that another sample would have three working handsets, so I'll have to look for another brand. Panasonic quality control has really failed here."
1,Terrible waste of money,"These phones are terrible! I thought I was getting a top of the line system and I am so disappointed. Phones do not hold a charge like they should, two of the three developed shorts in the phone. You will be talking to someone then all of a sudden the phone just clicks off. When they were still under warranty I sent in the phones to get replacements. Which I had to pay to do! The replacements were not any better. I will never buy another Panasonic cordless phone. Terrible phone, terrible customer service, worthless warranty!"
2,Dect 6.0 not for everyone,"Most all reviews stated Dect 6.0 technology was the way to go. That may be true for most people, but all I received was static. I hooked it up all over the house plus in the garage and the reception was the same. Turned off all electrical appliances, lights, etc. and nothing changed. For some unknown reason none of the phones would work without static from even a couple of feet away from the base unit. My old 2.4 ghz phone worked much better.I emailed Panasonic, but didn't receive an answer. I ended up returning the unit to Amazon because it was impossible to use."
1,Great for about 2 months.....,Works great for the first few months and then you lose reception 10 feet from the base. Not worth the money. I have used Panasonic for years but these phones are lousy. My daughter bought the same ones and has had the same trouble. I will try another Panasonic phone system because I have had good phones from them but not these ones.
5,Buy it!,"I understand that getting used to the Panasonic mindset on how to use their phone products can be a challenge the first time. So, if you're new to Panasonic, take a deep breath, slow down, and read carefully. This is no GE system you're dealing with.And, if you're thinking of upgrading from a present Panasonic system -- do it! We upgraded from a 2.? (something) system and WOW! Crystal clear, easy to use, and it even has an easy intercom.The system came out of the box and was operational with 10 minutes. Best phone system we've ever had. Highly recommend!"
4,Great Phone - Complicated Menu Items,One of the best cordless phones I've purchased as far as sound quality is concerned. It is stylish and loaded with features. The down side is that the features are difficult to set up and are not intuitive to use. Particularly difficult is trying to review the Caller ID information stored in the phone - this is an easy task on every other phone - but not on this one.
4,Suprising cons,"I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. Everything I was reading made this out to be a great phone for the price. While I don't entirely disagree and have been fairly pleased with my purchase for the past two months, there are a few features that I am missing that my previous Uniden phone had. First off and probably the biggest con, is that you are not able to assign certain ringers to certain people in your phonebook. Ugh! I really got used to hearing that special ring when that certain someone called. I wouldn't have to get up to know who was calling. Now I have to get up and check the caller ID on the handset. Secondly, this phone does not have one-touch dialing. Before, I was able to assign my most frequently called number to a button and press that one button to speed dial the number. Man I miss those 2 great features."
1,call waiting broke first week,"We purchased this phone and within the first week the call waiting feature broke. You would be on a phone call and when the call waiting beeped in the phone would automatically switch you over mid call. So you would be talking to the 2nd caller without warning and the 1st caller was left in silence wondering what happened. Panasonic customer service was really no help. They told me to unplug and remove the batteries to reset the phones. Didn't work, so I return the phones and purchased a different set of DECT expandable phones. Hopefully we won't have this issue again."
4,Great Deal,"Excellent reception with no feedback or interference with our wireless-highly recommend, great price for 3 phones!"
4,We've had this setup for over a year now and it's been good.,"After a year of use I can say that this phone setup has a lot of range, good sound quality, and some cool features that we use rarely but do come in handy, such as the speaker phone option and the headset jack on the side. My wife can plug a headset into it and get both hands free so she can walk around and do things while she talks.Also, they're not battery hogs. I can't even say that we've replaced batteries since we got it.The only thing I can't write about is the answering machine capability, which we have not used."
3,Panasonic DECT 6.0 cordless phones,"I am not happy with this phone at all, I have had Panasonic phones before but this unit does not compare to the 5.8 Panasonic. I can not be that far away from the base unit and it cuts out---my other one I went a mile from the house and it still worked."
2,Various Problems,"We got these phones because several of our phones were giving us static. These at first did that, too, though they've improved, but we also have one of these beeping suddenly and hanging us up and all of them go in and out of a ""dead air"" feel --- whatever that miked sound is that you usually have when talking on the phone disappears at times. Even though the person at the other end isn't affected, it makes you feel like you've lost your connection --- literally and metaphorically."
3,Seaon of Passion not up to DS standards,"I have read almost every book that Danielle Steel has written and Season of Passion is not one of her better books. The book seemed to drag on at times and I feel could have been so much better if the repeated bedroom scenes were not given so much attention. The story was very good and cutting out the unnecessary intimate scenes would have made it a much more enjoyable read. I found myself wondering why she had to keep repeating Jesus' name when she was either upset or frustrated? It seemed to me to be unnecessary and something that definitely didn't add anything to the story. I know that every author is allowed a few fair books and this book,Season of Passion. certainly was one of those fair books."
3,Not her best work.. but,"This may be due to the age of the book. According to the copyright, it was printed in 1979, so to someone who wasn't born then I find it a bit dated. The story line is very typical Danielle Steel with a rich girl meeting a wealthy guy. It's formulaic, but it has worked many times for her, so why change. The aspect of Tom after he gets injured is a bit overwhelming at times, and Kate never seems to get her romance with Nick off the ground. But I enjoyed her interaction with her son, and where Steel showed Kate's vulnerability after Tom's accident. As another reviewer said it's a read only if you're a die hard Steel fan. If not, I would recommend one of her more recent books such as the Dating Game."
2,kindle ed. only,"for the kindle version only: This book was so aggravating to read. Typos, ttypos, rypos, tyos. Get it? I can't even enjoy the story there are so many of them."
3,Not the best Danielle Steel,"This is a really great book by Danielle Steel, although it is not the best Danielle Steel book I have read.The book is really exiting and very interesting and it is hard to put down, even though it sometimes feel really long. Are you a true Danielle Steel fan, then read the book. If not, it's not that necessary."
1,dissapointed,"I was very upset by the language in this book. She does use swear words in most of her books, but this was uncalled for. It really put me off of the story line."
4,Season Of Passion--A great read!,"When I first seen this at the store I thought it sounded like a good book, and I was right! I really enjoyed it! I have been reading D Steel's books for a while now, and I have to say this is one of her better ones. (I have 41 of her books!)Kate and Tom are happily married and when he gets to old for a football career, he goes crazy. Mentally handicapped from a failed suicide attempt, he has to stay in a home while Kate raises their son Tygue. Kate has to learn to trust again and come out of the reclusive lifestyle she has been living in for seven years--even her son isn't used to have a lot of people around! Overall, it's good and I reccomend it."
4,Season of Passion,I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading Danielle Steel books. One of her better books that I have read.
2,memories of years past,"I read Season of Passion many years ago and lost the book in a move. I was happy to see it available on Kindle and bought it with anticipation. As I started reading, I realized two things. Danielle Steel's writing style has stayed extremely consistent over the years. Her plot patterns remain the same. And my taste in books has changed. ALOT. When I read it years ago, Kate Harper's dedication and values moved me. When I read it this time, I found her tiresome. Times change. Daneille Steel does not.While I empathize with Kate and her plight, I just can't feel sorry for the poor little rich girl who wasn't even willing to reach out to anyone in crisis."
4,good product,"The color on the image is slightly more green, actual item is more brown, army-green colored. Sigg makes such great products. I wish their mug/thermous' came in a few more colors. That said, my boyfriend seems to really enjoy it. He takes it to work everyday."
2,Not a Travel Mug,"Like many posts here I'll have to agree that this is no travel mug - it is a thermos. The one difference in this thermos is that it has a wider opening to be able to drink from.The top caps only function is to 'cap' the middle piece. The middle piece, that many seam to thing you drink from, serves only as a pressure release cap but nothing beyond that. You do not drink from the middle piece!To be a considered a MUG, Sigg needs to redesign the top, go with a slightly larger circumference so that it would not move about in our cars cup holder. You leave the cap off and you WILL have fluid all over you car. It will take two hands to open this thermos which is not good for driving.One thing is fore sure... this thermos does hold temperature really well. The paint is also fabulous.Would I buy it again? For the price probably not. It needs to be labeled a THERMOS."
2,"This Is Not A Travel Mug, It's A Thermos",It's billed as a travel mug but this item is a thermos only. It's like saying sipping from a water hose is equivalent to drinking from a cup. The advertisement is very misleading. I wanted a sophisticated travel mug and I got a great thermos.
1,Accurate,"The only thing good about the book is that they are in fact accurate, chronologically accurate in that theydo in fact come AFTER Lacan. The rest of the book does, like the other 1 star rating stated, use Lacanian jargon making it appear that they've come to some great understanding, where in fact they do not understand, or at least do not appear to since they cannot seem to explain what understanding they've come to, and delimit this understanding or try to make it greater than it is with fancy words. This may appeal to those that suffer from the ivory tower syndrome that still plagues what could otherwise be the rich field of study of psychoanalysis. I bought it new for about $19, and sold it used for about $17, and was glad to have only lost $2 in my exploration of yet another case of theoretical narcissism."
4,Cow Punk Lives in Hee Haw Hell!,"Well, it's a concept album. Thank God it's a concept album by a band that does not take it self seriously. This ain't 2112 - once again - thank God! The first time I listened to Hee Haw Hell I thought, "" I could live without the freakin' poems. But then I though, ""Your missing the concept, dingus, or maybe just the point."" Here's the deal - no one else is doing crazy stuff like this. It's Dash and it sounds great. Hee Haw Hell is frequently goofy and sometimes down right juvenile and I would have it no other way. Buy it and go see them live!"
3,Good but not great...,"Dash Rip Rock, even though well into middle age has put out several good albums in recent years. Hee Haw Hell is slightly below the quality of PayDirt or Sonic Boom. The songs across the board just aren't as strong and the production is lacking. The theme of the record, a hillbilly rock opera, is relatively well realized with several notable guest stars including Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon. But, again, the songs as a whole don't live up to the promise of the idea. Still worth checking out if your a fan. Good stuff to be had here for the long-time fan, just not as much as I'd like."
1,"Why RCA, why??","Great sound, actually incredible. I agree, the sun sessions CD needed to be updated, the rematered tracks are so much better, that they are a revelation now compared to that release. The sunrise edition, the one I own, is great, but is targeted mostly to fans who want to hear every alternate take and hissy live track of the period. But there is a lot of people that just want a concise CD, with great sound, of MASTER TAKES. Then why, oh why RCA, did you include an alternate take of 'I Love you because' instead of the master take???? You know why $$$$$$$$. That's RCA plot, never release a complete, definitive edition of anything, so you keep buying the same material over and over."
2,RCA ripping us off again,"First let me just say the music is so essential. This is Elvis before he went to RCA and the rot set in. You need this music!BUT...19 songs is very stingy on RCA's part. That probably adds up to 35-40 minutes or so of music on a CD... this would be the ripoff part.Your best bet is to hunt down 'The Sun Sessions CD' (used, of course) which came out in 1987. A lot more music (28 songs, 72 plus minutes); more bang for your buck.And, yes, RCA did come out with 'Sunrise' a few years ago, but are you really gonnna sit through 2 discs, 3/4 of which are outtakes?"
1,"Clean, Sterile, and Awful","I remember listening to my Dad's Sun Sessions LP back in the 70s as a kid. I also listened to the CD version issued back in the 80s or 90s. When I bought this CD, I was expecting that same sound, but what I got was a ""clean,"" sterile, completely dead-sounding version of the Sun Sessions. The echo and reverb, which were so integral to the magic of the original recordings, were gone.This version of the Sun Sessions is absolutely awful for that reason. In my opinion, who ever produced this version just doesn't get it. Rock and Roll is meant to be raw and raucous, maybe a little distorted and rough. That's what makes it so great, and that's what gives you goose bumps when you put on the old LP and hear Elvis, Scotty, and Bill tearing it up in a tiny little storefront studio in 1950s downtown Memphis.If you're a fan looking for that original Elvis Presley Sun Sessions sound, DO NOT BUY THIS CD."
3,I'm Sure the Redbook Is Just As Good,"Well folks, it is what it is. A poor attempt at surround sound. Amazing they did The Foundations, but won't do Love Forever Changes! If you get it under $4.00, add it to your SACD/DVD Audio Collection just to have it, but don't expect it to move you like some of the others."
4,Read it for the characters,"I have a love/hate relationship with this book. In some ways it is the richest Trixie Belden volume that Julie Campbell wrote - her wonderful skills in characterization and dialogue are on full display here. As some of the other reviews have noted, some of the scenes involving tomboy Trixie's efforts to pretend to be dressing up to try to ""vamp"" a boy she doesn't even really like are hilarious. Other scenes involving Trixie and her brothers are notable for their wit and the realistic and amusing depiction of sibling rivalry.In short, the characterization is just wonderful, as good as anything in any children's fiction I've ever read.As one other reviewer notes, however, this book is definitely lacking in the mystery department. That's disappointing and seems unnecessary. It's failure to ""deliver"" on that requirement of the genre unfortunately mars what is otherwise an outstanding piece of fiction writing."
2,Embarrassing; strictly for continuity fans,"Substandard. I could hardly wait for this muddled tale to end. Julie Campbell Tatham, writing as ""Julie Campbell,"" wrote the first six books of the series, and this, the fifth, stumbles. The scenes where Trixie tries to convince her family and friends that she's ""in love"" to achieve a noble secret agenda, were embarrassing and unnecessary -- she could have achieved the same end by confiding in her parents straightforwardly. And the ""mystery"" turns out to be a disappointing non-mystery. I recommend this book strictly to continuity fans who want to know every detail of the development of the Bob-Whites of the Glen club; otherwise, skip to the Mystery in Arizona for a believable story and entertaining (rather than ridiculous) style."
1,Limousine Liberal shows how he spends his $$$$$$,"Phony Public Broadcasting Liberal writes a compelling tale of how he could afford to buy his own island, of course, it's just a ""fixer-upper."" Wonder how much of his salary comes out of tax dollars?"
5,A magnificent printing of timeless inspiration,"This little gem of a book is an ideal gift of peace. Universal, soul-satisfying insights and comforts from the great yoga master who founded Self-Realization Fellowship. For the sincere spiritual seeker here are the fundamentals common to all true religions and spiritualities. For the average person in modern society, here is comfort and relief from the alienation and distress of our material cultures.As a retired psychologist and stress management trainer, I judge that the ultimate keys to handling stress in this crazy world are to be found in these few pages. They are filled with beautiful nuggets of reassurance and personal empowerment through attunement with universal spiritual principles.After you have sampled some of these possibilities from yoga's ancient and timeless spiritual strategies, hopefully you'll be inspired to explore some of the other titles the publisher lists herein."
4,Slim volume offers deep space for ongoing contemplation,"One of the finest qualities of this title is there is so much room for personal reflection, contemplation and application between the content. It isn't dense, yet it is best that you take time to slowly sip the words, to breathe them in and see what the text is saying explicitly and directly to you.Author and spiritual leader Paramahansa Yoganada teaches ""how to's"" in pithy chunks and nuggets of inspiration. There is plenty of space to read, breathe, reflect, ponder and meditate - which Yoganada teaches his readers, is a science.Further, the book teaches the reader how to be actively calm and calmly active so that the spiritual health may be at its optimum.Favorite quotes from the book include:""Seclusion is the price of greatness""""Peace eminates from the soul and is the sacred environment in which true happiness unfolds.""Definitely worthy of a read."
5,It helps,There is no magic book or guru that is going to make you happy and end the suffering and trials of life. But this book gives you some peace while you read it. And you feel good about things for a few hours afterwards. I have some other booklets by the author and I always find some gem of thought that makes me feel better.
3,Not for the experienced,"I too must agree after reading many of his books,there is much repetition and this is a very simple book not for the experienced seeker, but really for a beginner. A great spiritual leader he was, but some of his writings I did not get much from as I already learned it or heard it in a previous publication. No disrespect to the Great Yogi"
2,"Not bad, but the worst of the series","I've read 11 or so of the Examples and Explanations books while in Law School. For the most part, the series is great. The material is broken down into sections that make sense and the important points are made and remade with the examples.This book is probably the worst of the series that I've read. There are numerous spelling/editing mistakes. The author tries (and fails) to be funny to the point of distraction. The material leaves out some of the important rules that you'll need for the test. The interaction between this section of the UCC and the Bankrupcty Code is barely even mentioned. And, the section of the book on ""Priority"" is not nearly as strong as it needs to be. For the first time, my text book was actually more helpful than the E&E; book.I suppose I'd still recommend it, but don't rely on this exclusively when you're studying for the exam. This might be the type of class where legal flash cards, etc. would be more helpful."
2,"Not useless, but close","The author's Sales (Article 2) E&E; is much better than the Secured Transactions (Article 9) edition. Compared with other E&E; books--Civ Pro, PR--this one was miserable.This book is entirely practice problems. Each chapter has about one page of intro text and then all the rest is problems. This is fine if you just want something to work through, but I much prefer the model of other E&Es; where you get a chapter of 5 or 10 pages that cover all the basics, and then a question section at the end. This particular format makes it too difficult to find any information quickly. And, of course, as with all other E&Es;, the index is so utterly useless that it's actually more difficult to find material if you attempt to use it. You would be better off just opening at random until you find what you need.P.S. If you are taking any UCC class, do yourself a huge favor and buy the White & Summers UCC hornbook."
2,Lots of elaborate examples and explanations,This is a good example of how not write examples and explanations. This is the 5th E&E I own - and it is generally a good series. The examples in the Sec. Trans. book are too long [unnecessarily] and the explanations are are even longer. This contravenes the purpose of the series - CLARITY. The fact patterns and answers ought to be edited - and then book could be half the size and exponentially more clear. At that point it would probably be worth reading. Another book I liked better: Comprehensive Guide to Rev. Art. 9 by W. Gibson [200pgs; includes outlines and hypos/answers].
4,There is Nothing Else and This is Pretty Good,"This book had 90 percent of what I needed to know for my final, in a concise and clear fashion. I've not read any of the other books in the E&E series, so I can't comment on other's complaints. The only thing that this book really does not touch on at all is 9-4XX, so I recommend learning these sections from an outline or your assigned course material."
2,Smashmouth...?,"Speech sounds more like smashmouth then the Speech I remember and love...The CD is just plain cheesy and ridiculous...nothing can recapture that raw organic soul of his self titled debut, Hoopla was was i'd say 1/2 good and half cheesy...i used to love playing people speech for the first time...that cd had so much to offer...now i'd frankly be a little embarassed to play most of this CD....while i sound pretty harsh its because i long for that old speech...and while i sound harsh i have to mention songs that are ggreat...""late for my own funeral"", ""I really love you"" ""living in the real world"" i love... ""brotha speech"" would be good with out that horrible guest rapper who ruins the songs and doesn't talk about anything(a common theme in ruing speech songs of late)...so i'm writing this in the hopes that the speech sound i know and love will one day return,a dissapointed fan"
5,cool & comfy,These shoes are very comfortable. I'm a teacher and need to be on my feet for long hours. This pair of shoes provide great support both for my feet and heels. Need to order 1/2 size larger than your regular size.
5,Thank you to all that have served our country!,"Great book for reference photos and paint schemes of the AVG Flying Tigers! There isn't much in the way of history in this book, but many pictures and captions that help with markings and colors for the modeler. One of my favorite facts about the P-40 B in this book, that I just learned, is the U.K. ""roundels"" circles in the camoflage scheme that weren't used since the Nationalist Chinese insignia was used.If you ever wanted to build an accurate P-40 model for the Flying Tigers, this book is one I recommend!"
4,Best toilet paper there is... but gets used quickly...,"Simply put, this is the best toilet paper I've ever used. It's extremely comfortable, and that's really all you need in a toilet paper. None of that rough, scratchy stuff while wiping. It's also lint free, and soft to the touch.The only problem is the rolls don't last very long, so you'll need to stock up a bit. But other than that, great, great toilet paper."
2,Knock on wood,"While Ingebretsen's history of the early OTC and NASDAQ are detailed and interesting, I found his style both wooden and lumbering. He is hoplessly sqaure. Further, his analysis of the preY2K NASDAQ provides no insight. Witness....""Investing in Internet stocks was often like playing Russian Roulette.""His analysis into the post Y2K NASDAQ is even less insightful. He has the ring of that smug kid who constantly shouted on the playground, ""I told you so.""Still, considering the lack of serious and even semi-serious work on the subject, I think his effort is noteworthy. Hopfully something with a little more spice will come down the pipe."
5,Best novel of 2004?,"I was first exposed to Seth via Aimee Mann's last CD, the packaging of which contained four pages of moody sequential art -- okay, we can call it ""comics"" even though there's nothing particularly comical going on -- and ever since I've been waiting for more.So I was thrilled to discover that CLYDE FANS: BOOK 1 had been published. It's the story of two brothers in the fan business, one of them successful and the other a failure, in the 1950s. But of course that description doesn't tell you anything worth knowing about CLYDE FANS. What's worth knowing is that Seth masterfully depicts these two characters with stark dialogue and a palette composed almost exclusively of blue, black, and gray.In its way, CLYDE FANS is as affecting as any pure-prose novel that I've read. A truly amazing book that deserves to find a wide audience."
2,Could not get past the smell,"This product has a strong chemical odor that I couldn't handle. I use it reluctantly because I have paid for it, but am looking forward to when I am done."
1,Generator lasted 3 hours -,"The brand new generator, purchased for emergency power loss, ran for three hours then crashed. I had a shop take it apart. A bearing in the generator self destructed, with the ball bearings getting into the windings and destroying the generator. Customer service at Alton was finally reached after 20 calls over a month . Julie at Customer Service at Alton would not return calls. I finally gave up on getting help. Apparently Alton do not have parts for this China import. Customer service at Alton or any other department rarely answers their phone. I wrote Alton emails but never received a reply. My generator has to be thrown away. I will never deal with this company again."
1,"DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY , DO NOT BUY",All the bad reviews combined is exactly what has happened with my unit. If some one gave it a good rating just give it time the same you will have the same problems as rest of us! Never knew of a product that had no replacement parts were available and customer service so bad.
2,Terrible customer service,"We used this generator through two storms that knocked out power for a total of six days. It ran well. However, the generator leaks gas out of the gas fill and the fuel gauge when the unit is tilted to move it. Seals are no good. The starter rope frayed badly, and had to be replaced. Their customer service is in my opinion hard to get on the phone, unresponsive to requests, and has a uncooperative attitude. As this is an el-cheapo generator it appears that they have zero interest in being customer friendly. So, if you want an el-cheapo and are willing to take a chance on product quality and customer service, I can say that it did run through a couple of storms for us and is still functional. I would not buy from Alton again."
3,party game,This poster game was ok. however rather small. The children seemed to enjoy it! We used it for my daughter's second birthday.
3,Elmo,"The item was delivered very quickly. The only problem was that it was a lot smaller than i thought it would be from the picture, so i ended up buying a larger one also...Thanks."
3,Melanie Bluelakes dream,"Melanie Bluelakes Dream is about a cree girl moveing from Elk Crossing, A native reserve, to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. This is a good book in teaching aboriginal rights. This book i have to admit is shallow, but it gets the point across very nicely.... One other interesting thing is ... why didn't Melanie encounter racism? all and all i think that this is a good book that many pre-teen girls can relate to."
5,A simplified scientific answer to Darwinism,"Even though this book is written by a very respectful scientist, it is simple enough for any body to understand it and actually enjoy reading it. it was written in a funny, witty way that may appeal to a wide range of readers. the same author wrote another much deeper and complex book about the same topic which was intended for the more sicentifically inclined minds who would like to exmine, and find all the holes in the theory of evolution in an analytical and dry academic methodology. that is why I would strongly recommend this book ""God is"" to the common reader who would not be inclined to waiste time in a lot of scientific jargon."
3,An interesting review,I found this book very interesting from a historical perspective but frankly did not find the author's arguments very persuasive. While there is truth that during the cold war America was a leader and held sway over many parts of the free world - - to call it an empire confuses power with ownership.I believe the theory of the empire is particularly weak after the end of the cold war. Things are still in a great deal of flux and the period post 1989 is still too short a time to determine a trend. The longer term evidence and examples from President Wilson forward are not very convincing.I found the examples of inconsistancy and failure to execute with precision and success quite insightful and interesting.On balance I found the book disappointing with regard to its main premise and theme but very interesting in other ways.
2,"Some good photos, some not so good","Orange County has many photogenic locations and in some instances they are very well represented in this book. There are a number of truly beautiful images scattered throughout the 112 pages.Unfortunately, many of the pictures are considerably less impressive. Some are extremely grainy and unattractive, some aren't well focused, and still others look like they have been shot using color-altering filters to poor effect. In addition, there is a heavy preponderance of sunset/dusk shots. Dusk is a great time to shoot photos, but when one technique is used in such great repetition in a single collection of photos the effect becomes monotonous and the photographer begins to look like a one-trick pony.The author is an experienced photographer and is obviously capable of producing very good work. Sadly, he too often settles for shots that are not worthy of publication in a book like this. The uneven quality of the photos makes it impossible to recommend this book."
5,The Philosophy of Fire,"Henri Gamache has written a great book. The spells within are worked mainly using Psalms, but Henri has included other prayers that could be used as well. There are many little gems included in this book of 106 pages. I'm happy for having purchased it. I'm sure there are *one or two* spells in here I'll be working, eventually!"
3,Cool watch - does not last much,"About the price and product itself I have no complaints - it is nice, different, stylish, but it does not last much, it stopped working after a while of use, like 4 or 5 months.- Just like that, it was not the batteries, I dont know.-Still for the price is OK what it lasted to me.-"
3,not what I hoped,I was looking for a regular dictionary of names a la Kolatch's dictionaries of Hebrew names. This book gives great background but is not as easy to use and does not include many names.
3,"Yes, it has that ""Summertime"" song","Let's be honest -- Mungo Jerry is no lost British Supergroup. They did one classic song, ""In the Summertime"", and that one's on here. Of the rest of the songs, ""Lady Rose"" and ""You Don't Have To Be In the Army To Fight The War"" are pretty good, and the rest are completely forgettable. And then there's a turgid 10 minute version of ""I Just Wanna Make Love to You"" that reminds us of the era when British groups felt compelled to record a blues number, and of why that was a bad idea.I got this as a used discount at a store that was closing. I would definitely not pay the Amazon price for it -- You just want ""In the Summertime"", and you can find that on lots of CD compilations that are cheaper than this, and have other groups' classic songs as well.I did not attempt to play this in a DVD player, I just popped it in my computer DVD drive to rip to MP3, and that seems to have worked just fine."
5,My favorite vegetable guide,"This is a wonderful book detailing all vegetables imaginable. I love learning about vegetables and try out new ones, especially the ethnic ones. This book gives you good information about the vegetables and varieties available and also how to clean and cook them. A few recipes are also included, though it is mainly an encyclopedia of vegetables"
3,I really did buy it for the articles,"This issue had an interview with Elmo Zumwalt, an admiral who was intimately familiar with the vagaries of the cold war as well as Vietnam. Now, I am not saying that I threw out the rest of the issue, but I did buy it for this interview as well as the piece on Woodward and Bernstein. I certainly took no note of the Cyndi Wood pictorial, whoever she is (she played the playmate in Apocalypse Now during the choppered in and out performance for the guys in the movie...not that I know who she is.)"
1,What A Let Down,"I just got done reading this book. From someone who hasn't read any of the Gossip Girls series, I thought the book was complete, utter crap. The entire book consisted of nothing but sex, vulgarity, and name dropping. Every other sentence was filled with the discription of the not-so-creative character's couture clothing and the designer's names. It just seems like of a poor ploy for the author to be gifted by these brands for mentioning their names in her book. There were numerous grammatical errors and typos throughout the book, which was kind of clumsy on the publisher's part. Can't they afford a spell checker? In all, I think the book is probably one of the most boring, unimaginative literary flops... ever. If you want to know what a boarding school is like, why not just go to one?"
4,Boarding School Series,"I love reading about boarding school! This new series and The Principles of Love series are awesome - you see right into the drama, thoughts, and experiences of life away from home. Jenny, the main character of IT, is cool, but Love, (from the other series) is even better. Both are fun reads!"
4,Jenny keeps going! all right,"I thought this book was really good. The rumors, love triangles, and student-teacher relationship. What's not to love. Jenny strived even though people discouraged the whole way. If u don't know what I'm talking about but u want to know, read this book. I'm sure u won't be disappointed. ;)"
5,Not Just for Eggheads,"Don't let the subtitle (The Domestic Aesthetic and Moral Reasoning) scare you off! Although I am not university-educated, I enjoyed this book. I admit I skimmed some of the more eggheady bits (postmodern thought, for instance), but McCracken's analysis of the Domestic Woman in film, television, and advertising was fascinating. Her take on the women's roles in Best Years of Our Lives and A Letter to Three Wives was eye-opening. Give this one a shot."
4,Morgan Driver,This book would be a great addition to the bookshelf of any British sports cars enthusiast. It covers all the British marques in great detail and is full of excellent color photography. I have other books which I paid more for and are not of this quality.Highly recommended.
5,Great introduction to polymer chem...,"I was not able to fit polymer chem into my schedule at University, so I bought this book after graduating. This book is extremely organized and provides a lot of examples. The first of three sections provides a great introduction with the focus on definitions and structure. This is accomplished with very little reference to reactions.The next two sections, which are titled vinyl and nonvinyl polymers respectively, address reaction mechanisms and kinetics. This layout allowed for smooth transitions between sections and concepts were introduced and reinforced smoothly.The other thing I liked about it, is the continuous reinforcement of nomenclature...every time a name was used a corresponding structure was on that same page."
5,Premier Polymer Chemistry Text,"This textbook does an excellent job of going over the basics of polmer chemistry. There are insightful questions at the end of chapters that make students think and the book goes over the material in such a way that a background in organic chemistry is not necessary. If you need to learn about polymer chemistry on your own, this book is an excellent purchase."
4,Good Textbook,"This is a good Polymer Chemistry Textbook. It is very informative. However, it isn't the most exciting read. The book is completely black and white, making it hard to read for extended periods of time. I would recommend this textbook for the quality of it's information."
1,thanks for nothing,"I bought this ""book"" because I was interested by a pdf version downloaded from archive.org.The pdf version was pathetic : missing pages and such low resolution graphics that text was unreadable and pictures worthless. Surprise, surprise Amazon.com has reproduced exactly this defective copy and shamelessly foisted it on the public.The loss of a few dollars doesn't interest me, but being tricked and insulted is dreadful: Amazon sells what can be got for nothing, Amazon cares nothing for the quality of the products which it touts."
1,EXPIRED!,Everything was expired- so disappointing!!! I thought this would make a cute gift for my step dad but unfortunately he wasnt able to enjoy 90% of it. It wasnt just a couple months expired either..it was over a year old!
2,Wouldn't buy agin,"Not a good value for the money. Not as pictured, not nearly as full. Crackers were soggy and some of the boxes were crushed."
1,Do Not Order This For Anyone!,"Be sure to read the reviews from the recipients because they are the ones who will tell you that these processed foods are over rated, non edible junk!It's truly hard to tell the gift giver not to send these ""baskets"" any more because it was the thought that counts, right?Well, maybe not. For $50 you could do a lot better.Some of the food was packaged in India. How old do you think these items are and what are they made of?A lot of unhealthy and unpleasant tasting chemistry.Seriously, I unveiled the ""basket"" at a hoilday party to share and it becme the laughing stock of ""bad' or ""how bad will the next item be?"" And I'm not talking food connossieurs here. I had people in every age bracket, too. The kids wouldn't even eat the cookies. One of them tried to feed a moresel to the dog and even he refused.Please, please, do yourself a favor and do not ever send this box of crap to anyone that you like.THIS MAY BE THE MODERN WAY OF ""UNFRIENDING"" SOMEONE!"
1,Who sent this gift?,"I sent this gift to friend of mine whom was recovering from surgery. The gift arrived, but the get well note, that was to accompany the gift, was left blank. For several days my friend did not know who sent the gift. What a bummer."
2,Art of appreciation gift basket handyman's Toolbox of Treats Gift,"The basket had a great appearance online and looked to be ""larger"" than it was especially for the price. The contents were very small and individually priced. I bought this for my brother the portions were appropriate for a child. The same held true for the second basket of equal value I sent to my mother- in law. The only saving grace was the discount I received with applying for amazon credit card and receiving 50% discount."
1,Terrible,"Overpriced collection of inferior, heavily preserved snacks. Long life Brie Cheese Spread - seriously? Do not waste your money or your palate. I gave it 1 star because 0 is not an option."
3,a bit overpriced for what it is,the packets of snacks in it are small. it's contained in a paper gift basket that could've come from the dollar store.
5,Great birthday gift,I sent this gift to my father for his birthday. It arrived right on time and he was thrilled with the contents. It has a wonderful variety and good flavor.
1,No improvement from previous book?,"Charles Sabel clearly showed his bright idea regarding flexible specialization in his co-authored book published in 1984 with Piore. The new book, however, falls short of reader's expectation that something should have been added to his world of theory.Is he just playing around with words and repeating what he has spelled out in his ""The Second Industrial Divide""? This book just trys to fit the real world in his theoretical world. The world has changed a lot, but not his world of flexible specialization. This is a professional deformity."
3,Majesty of the Law: a review,"This book is not an easy read but worth the study, especially on the parts dealing with women and the law and with the jury selection process. Emphasis on the constitution and bill of rights in supreme court deliberations has been consistently changing throughout the court's history. Citizens' participation in bringing about change is also noted."
1,Dull and unappealing,"I picked up this book because I am currently in law school and I felt like it would give me some insight into the political undertones of the Supreme Court. However, I found it to be boring beyond belief. It was written like a 5th grade civics textbook. Justice O'Connor went on and on about the historical meaning of the constitution. She spent very little time on influential cases the Supreme Court has looked at in the past 20 years. It was really not at all worth the time. Even for someone who is just looking to learn the basics of the Supreme Court, you would fare better by pulling out an encyclopedia. It is certainly more concise."
3,Revealing self-protrait of a hack,"This is a highly revealing portrait of a truly dreadful smugly self-satisfied individual. (Only Ginger Roger's autobiography is more offputting.) If you're expecting embarrassing revelations about her colleagues, don't. As for as O'Conner is concerned, ""Everything is beautiful at the ballet, where every swam must have a handsome prince."""
4,Informative,"Like other books from Supreme Court Justices, this one is informative and interesting. It is very easy to read, probably more so than some of the others. The sections on law and history are very interesting. The section on women was not quite as interesting, but that was to be expected (focusing on a special interest as opposed to the broader scope of the court). The explanations of how the Court works is very good and something about which the public is often wrong. Overall, a good Supreme Court book."
3,Can't buy parts very easily!,"We bought two of these faucets. One came without an aerator in the end of the spout so the water comes out like a garden hose. We have called Elements of Design and you can't buy the part from them, they won't give you any information on it, and they told me that their parts are not available through a distributor either. I would not buy anything from them again, even though I love the design and color of the faucet."
4,Great Fun,"This is an immensely readable, enjoyable book. The characters are great, the story kept my interest, and the historical background is accurate and is inserted into the story in engaging ways. I have been reading a lot of historical mysteries this summer, and this is an excellent one! Good summer reading!"
5,Very good!,"The cover art and the title did not seem promising but I was pleasantly surprised by this well-written Medieval mystery. The characters, especially Lady Appleton, seemed very real. Like another reviewer noticed, the author spilled the beans too early (Chapter 4) but it was still an exciting ending even though I knew who the perp was."
1,"Fading away, but soft","""Bamboo"" soft towels make a pretty picture in the bathroom. However,with every wash the sandlewood color is fading to orange on one of the washcloths! Two of the handtowels have also developed white spots after washing.This towel got high ratings, but we wouldn't buy them again."
5,Great item!,"Very handy to have, and I also like that it functions as a night light while it's plugged in. We have 2 and keep them in key locations. I've also given them as gifts."
1,Nice design but didn't work for me,I bought this because after using many Coleman products over the years when camping I've always been impressed by their brand. But this was a disappointment. It just never held a charge. I emailed Coleman and finally received an answer from them -- the day after I had packed it up and posted it for return! (Their advice: to make sure the prongs were fully pushed all the way in before turning it on.) Duh -- did that! It would have been helpful if troubleshooting instructions had been included. The only thing that came with it was documentation on where/how to recycle the battery.
4,Coleman 4-Hour Rechargeable Flash Light,This is a great product and very reliable. I have had it for several years now and leave it plugged in my kitchen. It is ready to go at a moments notice. The shape makes it easy and comfortable to use. I do not have any negative comments.
2,I expected more,"I was surprised that this DVD was only 24 minutes long. Although it had a concise outline of elements of (1) a cross examination debate; and (2) a Lincoln-Douglas debate, I had expected to see an actual debate. Instead, it is a series of several posters with a few interspersed shots of students speaking a sentence or two at a podium."
4,Helpful Book,My grandson ordered this book and says it is very helpful for playing the game. It was received in excellent (almost new) condition.
1,Does NOT fit Zen Microphoto!,This case doesn't fit the 8Gb Zen Microphoto. The case covers the top 1/2 inch of the screen and fits too loosely. I have not tried the chargers yet. I will be returning this product for a refund
4,Another moving story from Deborah Bedford,"Although the plot is one readers have seen many times before (unfaithful spouse, secret child), Bedford's writing has a beauty of voice that makes this book special. I'll be recommending it to others."
5,Carla,"I bought this for a dear Johnny Cash ""nut"" in my life, one of my blind students, and he LOVES this. This kid knows everything there is to know about Mr. Cash, and for him this was a treasure. The seller shipped quickly (thank you so much!) and did a great job."
3,A mix of good and not so great short stories about Couthern culture,"Okay stories in general with a couple of standouts. I like the ones that tell personal stories, while making a larger cultural point."
3,More Sweet Tea Review,"There is something for everyone in this book, and the stories touched on all emotions. I liked it alright but it didn't really keep me turning the pages."
5,More Sweet Tea,Very nostalgic collection of short stories set in the South mid century. Very evocative writing that brought the past to life again.
2,More sweet tea,This book was not nearly as good as the first Sweet Tea. Someone needs to edit much more for quality.
2,More Sweet Tea leaves me Sour,The way this was introduced has left me with a sour taste. I wasn't familiar with the Sweet Tea Stories and I thought it was going to be more of a story not stories. I was very disappointed in this book. It should've said this is a book of short stories right at the start.
2,Lightweight tales,"I should have paid more attention to the book description. My taste in Southern short stories tends toward Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, and William Faulkner, and these stories are of a completely different ilk. They're OK for light entertainment, but the writing is typically quite ordinary, many of them are predictable, and some are plain boring. The only one that intrigued me was Deborah Smith's ""The Mermaid of Cow Pie Spring,"" which gradually revealed how the main character got to be in her unusual and somewhat desperate predicament."
5,"A ""Must Read"" for Business Owners Planning to Sell","After reading this book as a refresher, it brought back to my attention the considerable details in selling a business. The book has given me an update on all the steps involved in selling a business--everything from when and how to tell employees about a forthcoming sale, through negotiating the purchase price and related legal documents, all the way to the final closing process.This book is a must read for anyone planning to sell his or her business."
4,Very informative,This book was easy to understand and read. Not over your head on how things should be done.
4,Bluegrass Top 20 Gospel Songs of the Century,enjoyed it a lot nice words liked all the different singers l would recomend this to all who enjoy gosple music
2,Not what I expected.,Too many of the selections are poorly recorded and by artists that don't rate being on a top 20 gospel collection. I wouldn't recommend this CD.
4,"Is this what punk is supposed to sound like? Yeah, it is.","don't put one genre into such a small box. There's a lot more to it than you think.Great band and album, try some Beatnik Filmstars if you're really into this."
4,Holy crap,"Probably the best album of its kind since Gang of Four's Entertainment! Forget Franz Ferdinand, the Futureheads, Bloc Party, and the virtually countless other bands ripping off Go4; this is fantastic. Liars are probably the only band doing this formula right AND nailing the attitude that should go along with it. Great stuff for the post-punk fan who's less than thrilled as to where the style's heading."
4,This CD gets better and better,"If you buy this album, you'll have to let it sink in for a wihle. It gets better the more you listen to it. The actual album part is only about 20 minutes long and the last song is half an hour of boring-this is the biggest problem with the CD: it's too short. I wanted more. I wasn't too impressed at first but now I love it. More, need more.Buy the new YYYs album also (Fever to Tell 4.29.03!)."
1,Sorry...I tried...I really did.....,"After reading the reviews for this album and hearing about it over and over from friends, I decided I would buy it and give it a listen. It seemed to be right up my alley....I am usually very pleased with anything that comes out on mute....So I listened...and listened and listened...I really wanted to like this disc...I tried....I really did...but this is so awfull...so boring...so completely unoriginal....Its been done 100 times before by better...much better...but then it wouldnt be too hard for anyone to do better than this....an excruciatingly painful listen...no redeeming quality what so ever.These guys need to stop mimicing their influences and have an independant thought or two..then give it another go."
4,best dance punk band ever?,"in just one tiny debut album the Liars have firmly planted themselves in my mind as one of the best bands out today. A 6-foot tall Australian singer who just kind of...tells it like it is but uses words that just kind of...fly over your head. Oh, and brilliant head-turning lyrics also. A rhythm section straight out of a funk/punk/hiphop brew, they create songs that seem to bludgeon your head wide open. Guitar, although ever slightly sparse, is raw as hell. This group is extremely musical, full of great beats and funk grooves. Brilliant, musical, and certainly unique. Check out ""Mr. Your On Fire Mr."" and ""Garden was Crowded and Outside"". If u like Gang of Four, or The Blood Brothers, or..hell, its damn good music!"
2,Rock is for boneheads,"I think this band did better with their song ""Chinese Bombs"" when they were known as Blur. The well ran dry for rock long ago. So, instead of masterbating all over your cd inserts how about you rock hipsters start to pick up some instruments and play real music (which this, sadly, ain't)."
4,Scarier than Orwell's 1984.,"When George Orwell wrote 1984 in 1949 the free world had just destroyed two totalitarian regimes and still faced another. The idea of Big Brother was all too real, even though the technology that Orwell described was not. Michael Freeny, an American psychologist, has written a novel somewhat like 1984, but this time the technology is all too real, and the threat comes not from a political regime but from the marketplace. The reality of modern information technology makes this book terrifying."
5,Right on book about healthcare gone crazy.,"I haven't ""had time"" to read fiction in about 10 years. I forgot how fun and enlightening it can be. Freeny does an amazing job of high-tech talk in human terms. And it's so true."
3,"Not Bad, But More of the Same","Another good read from Anne LaBastille, but the schtick is starting to wear a little thin. I loved Ms. B's first book, and was looking forward to this second installment.Don't get me wrong - I liked it enough, and I finished it with no problems. Anne's adventures start to wear a little thin after the excellent first book though (""Woodswoman""). She builds a second cabin, animals die, she hurts herself, she meets a man, etc. It its details, it is really very much like the first book, only a little more old-hat, and a little more preachy. However, if you are interested in following the author's story, it is of course, just what the doctor ordered. I find it a bit braggy, and a bit of a bore now and then.The book bills itself as ""her decision to retreat further,"" which I certainly do not find to be the case. In fact, it is more like ""her decision to retreat less."""
4,Kayaker 53,"Book arrived in as new condition, and in a very timely manor. This is the second in the Anne LaBastille series and I'm enjoying the reading."
5,Woodswoman II,I have read all the Woodswoman books. She is amazing. I feel like I know Ann. Anyone who enjoys nature and the outdoors life will want to get this series.
2,Gunman's rhapsody,"I thought when I heard that Robert Parker was writing a western I was thinking maybe he would show a similarity to the PI and the cowboy of the old west. WRONG! This is another Wyatt Earp, Johnnie Ringo, Bat Masterson etc......book. There is a simiarity between the conversations of Wyatt & Josie and Spenser & Susan but I was thinking that just Parker's style. Let's get back to Spenser."
1,Love Robert Parker but hate this book.,"Normally, I love Robert Parker books. However, Parker should stick to the gritty detective novels. The plotline is sketchy and at times hard to follow. It takes place in Tombstone, AZ and is the story or Wyatt Earp and the showdown at the OK Corral. Annoyingly, it does not even include the showdown, which is too bad because Parker is good at describing gunfight scenes."
1,Dwindling Effort,"As a former rabid fan of Robert Parker, especially the Spenser series, it saddens me to say that this book is just another of Parker's recent half-hearted efforts to put something in print. In Gunman's Rhapsody, he rehashes old plots and dialogues from print and movie script. The publisher, in collusion, allows it to go out with it's deceptive practice of meager word count, large font, and widely spaced lines. Robert Parker is tired folks. After so many great works, he doesn't seem to want to write anymore. Don't buy this book."
3,"Oh man, look at all these bad reviews.","Well, I'm certainly not going to take issue with that. This is not Parker's finest hour.In fact this is really for devoted fans only as far as I can tell.This is a real twist on the classic OK Corral story, and not a very good one. I found myselfsomewhat entertained by the occasional zippy dialogue, but this was an opportunity wasted IMO.I expected more. 3 Red Sashes, and I'm being kind."
4,Spenser Goes west,"First Robert B. Parker turned his series detective hero Spenser into a woman (for the Sunny Randall series), now he has Spenser travel back in time to the old west to play Wyatt Earp -- with Doc Holliday as a kind of low budget Hawk. All the familiar Spenser ideals of love and honor are there, and there's some anachronism (did they really talk about ""securing the perimeter"" in the old west?) which makes it easy to make fun of Gunman's Rhapsody. But the story zips along, and it's a well imagined version of the familiar OK Corrall legend. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed it almost despite myself."
3,Spenser at the (just OK) Corral,"Critics loved it & all in all it's an ok read. Basically it's Spenser in the old West. Parker focuses on too few aspects of Wyatt Earp's life w/too much existential angst.All in all it's a good entertaing read. It's a sentimental favorite because it drove me to read the true western writers ( Braun, Keltner, Johnston, & L'Amour).Not (IMOO) worth full price."
2,Time Travel for Spencer,"Have you ever put aside a Parker book, too bored to continue? This one was a first for me.Parker's protagonist, Wyatt Earp, sounds surprisingly like Spencer, and various other characters remind me strongly of Susan, Hawk, etc. The dialogue that delights when spoken in Parker's Spencer series, sounds flat here.Sadly, I don't think this Western book works, but I'll be eagerly awaiting his next mystery."
2,Parker Shoots and Misses,"Okay, maybe we have already been overexposed to the Earps, Clantons, Doc Holliday and the rest. But Parker just missfired in this ""historical"" retelling of the most famous story of the old west. The characters fail to develope. After awhile you just wish the shooting would get done. Where Parker's characters usually are multi-dimensional, here they are cartoonish.As usual, Parker is an easy read. I did get through the book quickly. But there were no surprises."
2,Disappointing performance for Parker,"Rhapsody is the story of Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, his love life, his brothers, and the shoot-out with the Clantons at the OK Corral. It's not the best version. I have the greatest respect for Parker. Looking for Rachel Wallace is a masterpiece of the modern mystery, the first mystery I ever read, and fifteen years later I'm writing them myself. I do whatever it takes to get a new Spenser novel, even though in the last ten years they've been longer on humor and shorter on action (with the exception of Thin Air). No matter. I could read a book with Spenser, Hawk and Susan doing nothing but sitting around a table, I'd be immensely entertained. But Rhapsody has none of the humor, none of the cleverness, none of the insight Parker is famous for. It's limp, boring, and dies on the page. It's a struggle to make it to the end. I love Parker, but there's no wit or humor here, no real plot twists, no life. Even the great ones put out the occasional dud. Sorry, Bob."
2,"This pains me, but....","I GENUINELY hate writing this, as I'm a huge fan of Parker's work, but I'm also honest, so here goes...I've seldom been so disappointed in a book in my life. I've the feeling that Parker was going for a kind of ""spare"" feel to his prose in GUNMAN'S RHAPSODY, but all he managed was to make it feel thin, instead. And this could have been so much more.Is this evidence that Parker is trying to churn out books, rather than take the neccesary time to give us wonderful works like A CATSKILL EAGLE, or ALL OUR YESTERDAYS? I dunno, but if so, please slow down!"
1,Parker's Name is Only Item of Interest in this Book,"Clearly, someone wagered Parker that he couldn't write another account of OK Corral gunfight AND sell it.The tipoff on this book is Parker's name at 5 times the size of the book title AND Parker's name is at top while the title is well at bottom of the cover.Do not buy this book; if you have to read it, get it from the local library. There is nothing of interest, nothing in the characters, nothing for a plot that you cannot discern in firstthree pages.Finally, this book fails the Dan Jenkins first page test."
2,Didn't Like it.,Parker misses big time. He has ripped off the Costner film version of the Earp saga. The only character I felt he fleshed out more firmly was Morgan Earp.What's up with the lousy ending..... take a pass on this one unless you are a Parker completist
4,An Update of a Familiar Story,"Robert Parker (of Massachusetts) had a notable career as the author of the popular Spenser and Jess Stone series, which were both in the Boston metropolitan areas. These series had continuing characters, story lines and overall enjoyable reading.One does not expect this ""easterner"" to move 2500 miles to the American West for other tales, but that is precisely what Parker did in 2001 with the Gunman's Rhapsody. Parker took the familiar story of Wyatt Earp and his four brothers and retold it with the Parker approach to dialogues and action. Kirk Russell's Tombstone and Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp each flavored the historical events with their own slant, and Parker does the same.Overall, this is a light and fun read that should be enjoyed in the way I suspect the late Robert Parker intended.Dr. John Hogan CHA CHE CMHSHospitalityEducatorsHogan Hospitality"
5,CD: Glory of Christmas,"Excellent!!!. The CD is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased this title CD over nine years ago, but damaged it. I was so pleased to loct it on Amazon. I think it is new."
5,A nice sampler of 10 tracks from one of the very best Christmas albums,"The ten tracks on this CD were originally issued in 1963 as part of a spectacular 4-Lp set by Reader's Digest calledJoyous Music for Christmas Time.In the 1990's Sony Special Products licensed these tracks from RD and put out a number of compilations. This was one of them, and since it does not contain any extraneous filler it is one of the best, but i will leave you wanting to hear the whole album (in proper order...the flow of material in the original sequence is nothing short of fantastic.)See my review in the original album listing to discover how you can assemble most of the tracks."
2,Okay for a rainy day read,"There wasn't a whole lot of real news in this book, but it's always nice to read about Jackie Kennedy. This book is a little bit slow going, and dull, but once I got into it I had to keep reading. I only wish the writer had gone into more detail about her relationship with her children and the Kennedy family. It always seemed to me that Jackie tried to shield her children from the influence of the Kennedy men, and I was curious to see if that was true. However, not much detail was given there. All in all, it was no earth-shattering work."
1,A Hum-Drum read!,"This book read like all the others written about JBKO. There was nothing new here. The same old, tired facts about her life with JFK and Aristotle Onassis, and her life after the death of both men. She obviously achieved what she had always hoped to - privacy, because no has managed to write a book about this incredible woman with any new or unknown information about her. Bravo Jackie! A very dull book. Don't waste your time with this one!"
3,Pleased but not,"I had to read a biography for school, and I was very interested in Jackie Kennedy Onassis. The main reason I selected this book was that it gave a biography over her entire life, rather than other books that only gave a small portion in her life. But on the other hand it was extremely long, and had a lot of extra info. that wasn't needed."
1,A poor tribute,"Unfortunately this book by Mr. Deans, the late Ms. Garland's last husband, comes across as an attempt on his part to cash in on his ""connection"" to this great and much loved personality. It could have been better. It isn't."
3,"it works, after it broke connecting for the first time","The first time I plugged this in, the plastic housing and the connector all separated. After piecing it back together and covering the housing in tape, the cable works. I would recommend wrapping the plastic housing on the playstation end of the cable in electrical tape as soon as you take it out of the box. Cheap price, cheap construction but it does get the job done."
5,2nd cord for free!,it was awesome that they sent a second cord along with the other one. I thank them for doing that
4,works great!,Works great no complaints!!! Bought it for my grey playstation and it plugs right in and I was playing my old games again!
4,it works...,I received my product promptly and tried it out. It worked so far. Hopefully it will last for the long run...
3,AV cable review,"I didn't buy a game, I bought an AV audio cable for the game console I had. Unfortunatley, the game needed a lot more help than just an AV cable and I ended up buying a new console for my boys. But the cable did work, it's just that the playstation was shot."
3,replaced,i needed a replacement for my cord that got broken this one has a shorter cord but it works great
3,"It does the job, but don't pay for expedited shipping!","The cable works fine so far but have only had a week. We will see how long it lasts. Its just a simple basic cable, you probably get what you pay for. Not the same for shipping though. I paid for the expedited shipping and they still sent it regular USPS mail."
1,"cheap, and poor quality","The cable was shipped quickly and looked decent, however it came apart within 15 minutes of installation, one of the wires simply came apart. Now we will test the lifetime warranty."
4,works great,"this does what it is supposed to do and I can now play my playstation games again. Works well, stays in place and I have had no issues with preformance."
4,"SUPER FAST SHIPPING A+++ Cheaper quality than expected, but it gets the job done!","The product I received works perfectly, and is brand new like described, but it is a cheap knock off of the real PS2 AV cable, it might not last as long as a real Sony cable, but you get what you pay for!"
1,not well made,One of the connector metal covers came off. The connectors are metal coated plastic. I had to get pliers to get the coating out of my vcr!
5,Not really a game,"Great for the playstation 2 lol but it helped me satisfy my crave for Scarface which is much better than Grand Theft Auto in my perspective, if u like the movie"
5,FAST!,"I ordered this product for very cheap, like $3, and recieved it literally like 4 days later. I am VERY satified. The cord works fine too, it got rid of the annoying buzzing sound that my old one was giving while playing games and dvds on my ps2."
4,It works,"Its an average cable, nothing special, although i recommend you take care of it because i broke the tip of the sound cables when moving my TV. BTW a cable is not fun i dont know why amazon would place a fun rating,i just put 5 stars because its fun when playing the ps2."
5,I WAS SATISFIED!,I live in the South and it came in two days nicely packaged in bubble wrap and plastic in a sealed new bag. Work perfectly flawlessly. Would recommend to ANYONE.
5,Exactly What Was Needed,"One of the kids that comes here needed a video cable. Since he never complained about needing a cable again, I assume it worked great. It sure arrived plenty fast."
5,It's a cable.,It gets the job done. Works like it's supposed to.For that I'd give it five stars. Ignore the fun rating - cables aren't supposed to be fun.
4,alright replacement,Works like it's supposed to. Doesn't really fit my PS2 snuggly so it falls out if dust hits it. Get what you pay for.
1,Get what you pay for,"This cable was so cheap it wasn't worth it, first it wasn't anywhere near 6 ft more like 4 and when pluged into my vcr and needed to remove the wire came right out of the rc connecter. If I knew this was such poor quality I would if never bought it. They get you that way cause it costs more to return it then to just throw it out. Which is where it is now. Went and spent a couple more dollars and bought a real one from used video store."
1,Good at first,It worked perfectly as described when I first got it but the thing broke after I had it for about a week. The sound plays but the video refuses to show. Invest the money to get a higher quality cable! Don't skimp like I did.
5,"""A small joyful compact book packed full of fun...""","Robbie Willmarth, Chicago radio commentator, says, ""I couldn't put it down...a small joyful compact book packed full of fun, witticisms, homages...wonderful insight into human nature. I believe you'll feel a little bit better about yourself and your world after reading 'Dad's Tweed Coat'."""
5,Great Design/Little Hard to Clean,"I purchased two sets of these for my husband. Previously, grilled meat had been known to fly off other skewers and knock wine glasses over. He has a lot more control considering the design of these skewers. The spring mechanism is a great way to deal with holding the push bar in place until you are ready to release the grilled items onto your plate. My only criticism is that the springs are difficult to clean despite being stainless steel."
5,I can't live without reading it!!!!,"This book is the exceptional,wonderful, book we have all been waiting for!I've seen people with all these phony stories about this book being bad for you but you know what ,their Lunatics cause this book is fiction and if they'd realize it that means (NOT REAL)So feel free to read these books of wonders thats a big comedy and has cool stories about a regular wizard teenager named Harry living a teenage life!=)Its cool and exciting and that will blow you away!!!And will thrill you!It has a plot that will make any body excited and supicious to who did what and the final answer to the story!"
3,It's not the same as before,"I bought this product three times in 2007 at a Body Shop store in a Minneapolis mall because I liked the scent so much. Last month I ordered the same product from Amazon, but the scent is certainly different. I was able to compare them side by side:2007: Salty and fresh, like being on the beach in California. Bold tangy limes throughout. Think of a traditional margarita with salt on the rim of the glass.2012: A clean crispness, but little more. There's no saltiness, and the limes have been reduced so much that the crispness is all that's left.There's nothing special about the current product. I had placed an Amazon order to automatically ship the product every two months, but I'll cancel that now."
3,"excellent photos, but not much else is happening here...","this book is full of great and rare photos of bob dylan in the studio, performing on stage, lounging about, and just being cool. but i was disapointed in the text- it lacked inspiration and enthusiasm. this is a biography meant to be read by dylan novices, and hardcore fans will be disapointed. what saves the book from being a total rip off is the collection of photographs- the pictures tell the story in this book, not the author. which, in a way, is fine- like the man said, ""nobody does dylan like dylan..."""
2,GREAT PICTURES!.......Text is cursory and inadequate.,"This book has many great photos which is a good thing because the text is cursory, shallow and somewhat inaccurate. Appears to be written by someone who looked up Dylan in the encyclopaedia but knows little about the music or the man. The accolades on the back cover are a joke. It would be funny if it were not insulting to reasonably informed Bobcats. Informative (if sometimes misleading) only to the Dylan neophyte. Take with a grain of salt. But as I said...GREAT PICTURES!"
5,The Best Dylan Biography Every!,"This book is amazing, you can find facts you had know idea about, but it's also not filled with useless facts that nobody cares about. It's filled with great pictures, and you can see Dylan as he grows up. The only problem with this book is that I couldn't put it down and I finished it in two days. You can tell that Matteo is a big Dylan fan and not some guy tring to make money. Great Job Steve Matteo!"
2,Chaotic Action Mixed With Frentic Illustrations,"What may have been a decent story in a six-issue arc, turns out to be a chaotic mess of art and storytelling when compacted into four issues. These being the first four issues of the new ""JLA"", I would have thought they would have taken more time in developing the characters, interaction, and story. None of that is here. It's non-stop action without a frame of reference to go by. Imagine taking a handfull of fight scenes. Now put all the panels in a blender and mix them up. Try putting them back together. You have extra pieces? That's ok, squeeze those panels in there somewhere. The reader is only 8 years old and doesn't know better. NOT! A poor beginning. ""JLA: Year One"" by by Mark Waid was a much better introduction to the JLA."
5,A return to the spirit of the ORIGINAL JLA,The first JLA series was great The JL Europe etc. WAS A JOKE! This kicks off with a bang the way the JLA ought to be done!
4,not bad,"When a new batch of super heroes land on earth they are praised by humans. But the JLA senses danger. Soon the planet is under mind control making them hate JLA. The new guys proves to be even stronger than imagined.The book is okay but has a few plot holes. And Aquaman uses an incredilbe power that just leaves you asking: ""Why doesn't he always use that?"".This book is good but not essential."
3,"Great artistry, predicatable story, glad the JLA seven are back together","This book was originally JLA #1-#4.It's great to have Superman, Batman, WonderWoman, Flash, Green Latern, Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter reunited again. With this much power, you have to have large enemies. Unfortunately the story of an alien race coming to invade is tired and predictable.Batman has a great part in this story, as he usually is overshadowed by the others. And the balance of Flash and the young Green Latern's goofiness vs. the seriousness of the others always makes this team work great.My son's favorate pane: page 82, of course with Flash and GL (""low quality finish, Lantern."" ""Yeah? Kiss my ring, buddy"". My is on 83, an excellent drawing of WonderWoman battling Primaid.Fantastic artistry, all of the JLA members are drawn superbly. Hoping the story gets better with the next one."
2,This new JLA series is not as good as people say,"I really do not see what people like in the newest JLA series. The art is decent, but the stories are horrible. There are NO good enemies for this team. Until someone comes up with some good villians, the JLA can never be as good as their individual members. The only good part in this book is when Batman fights alone against the villians."
1,JLA new world is an example of bad writing!,"The story was so unintelligent that it read like a comic book that comes with a happymeal. In other words, cheap promotional ploy. The hyperclan were such crummy enemies that I think Superman could have cleaned all their clocks even without the help of the JLA. Since when did Superman needed help? Flash and Green Lantern's lines were corny efforts at trying make conflicting characters in such a short 4-issue mini-series. It just doesn't work. I'm no English major, but at least I know good story-telling from bad. Grant Morrison should start watching Superfriends cartoons to find out how the real JLA should be like!"
3,"Text, not pictures","Oddly, it's the text summary at the beginning that's the best part of this book. A 30 page wrapup that describes the social and technical reasons for the changing styles, which is often absent in these surveys . The pictures themselves are all excellent, but they are mostly familiar subjects."
3,"high quality, but not protective for the instrument","Band teachers dont like this bag. it is more protective than a backpack, but it does not give the protection like the hard-box case.Dented instruments cost $60-100 to fix, and can affect the tone. So this bag is good for adults, but not middle schoolers."
4,"''Fantastic story, Hepburn and Barrymore are great!''",Very entertaining.A WW1 vetran escapes from a mental hospital the day his wife divorces him for another man. When he meets the daughter he never knew and trys to win back his wife he changes their lives forever.
5,Compelling and Eye-opening,"This is Robert Frank's best book. As is true of everything he writes, Frank's style here is clear and engaging.He aims to show that human emotions are created by natural selection to increase the individual's chances of survival. What appear to be a person's irrational reactions and inclinations often promote mutually beneficial trade and, thus, promote that person's long-run welfare. The explanation of how emotions achieve this remarkably beneficial outcome is the core of this fine book.Of all the many serious books that I've read over the years, this one is surely among the most fun! It's fantastic reading."
2,Too trivial,If you an intermediate guitar player - then you already know more than 50-60% written in the book. If you are a beginner - then might be 20-30% of the information will be useful for you. If you are a pro.. than 0% will interest you.
5,Great Book for Baseball Fans,"I've had this book sitting on my shelf for a couple of years and just recently got around to reading it. I'm glad that I finally read it, but wish I would have gotten to it sooner.Jocks and Socks is a great book. The behind the scenes look at the world of baseball was very interesting. It was a great look into life inside the locker room and what really goes on before, during and after a game. Reading about the players of days gone by brought back some great memories.Given the fact that Ksicinski was a clubhouse manager at County Stadium, home of the Milwaukee Brewers, was especially interesting to me since I'm from Wisconsin. I strongly recommend this book to any and all baseball fans or sports fans in general for that matter."
1,Used once and threw away,"I was looking for something to keep my ears warm for running in the cold. I ordered this headband based on a plethora of positive reviews that I read online saying that this was a thinner headband that still retained warmth. I wore the headband out once and was so disappointed that I promptly threw it in the trash. The day I used it the weather was probably in the 40s with a slight wind, not more than a mile into my run, my ears started to hurt from the cold. I'm back to using my old hat until I find something else, but buyer beware, perhaps try in stores before purchasing. I, for one, was extrememly disappointed that I wasted money on this product."
2,A real page turner...just kidding,"What a waste of time. I had to read this book for my Computer Ethics class and it's hard to imagine a less interesting book. Some of the articles are not very well written, but ALL of them are boring."
1,Aweful,Terrible movie. Not at all one that I would recommend to any body anywhere. I wish I had never watched it.
4,Classically French. Film Noir - Sex Comedy hybrid,"First, If you hate or just don't tolerate French cinema, then this movie is not for you. Unlike the French comedy Amelie, this film is not presented in a very straightforward manner. In fact many scenes are heavily stylized and the distinction between reality and fantasy is blurred. There are times you can't tell if the characters are actually experiencing something or fantasizing about it. Is Monica Bellucci serious about leaving her escort life behind? Or is she just scheming to swindle Francois? The movie has some bizarre moments that may confuse some viewers but if you can look beyond that and keep an open mind, it's a pretty entertaining film."
2,Disappointing,Wonderful cast and decent screen play but it never really took off. The ending left me feeling in mid-stream. Love em or leave em!
3,silly,"it was trying too hard to be artistic. it had some good qualities, but was disjointed overall. of course, gerard depardieu was fabulous. the 'could be' gangster.not terrible, but i would not see it again or recommend it to a friend."
1,Very boring,"Found it boring, wasn't my type of movie. Really just tried it to get a free amazon prime movie, but I only lasted about 20 minutes into the movie before turning it off because it was so bad."
3,about the DVDfilm/movie how much do you love me?,"at the end thought what bang bang and die, it is just an infidelity film afterall, recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film.How Much Do You Love Me?Review writteb by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS Msc (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kah"
5,Elena ha muerto hoy....,"Hoy es 9 de Junio del 2002.... Hoy Elena Burke ha dejado de existir fisicamente pero jamás se alejará de la memoria y el cariño de los que la conocimos y de los que disfrutamos de su inmenso arte.Este disco y otros... y muchos otros no serán nunca suficientes para valorar a la ""Señora Sentimiento"".Sea este un pequeño homenaje."
1,How sophisticated!,"What kind of music do you imagine when you hear the words Cuban music? Those who don't know much about it might imagine something impassioned but rather naive. However, what you hear on this CD is the ultimate of sophistication. For example, the phrases played by the flute, which you can listen to at the intro of Comprension is played so skillfully and gorgeously that it has no peer except Hubert Laws. And Malena Burke's skill of singing and her voice give us wave of sentimentality but they aren't any kind of saccharine sentimentality. Anyhow you can't be disappointed by the CD if you like Buena Vista Social Club or such female singer like Sarah Vaughan even though you don't know much about Cuban music."
5,The Real Reason For The KKK,"This book is about the terrible times that the people of the South went through after the ""War For Southern Independence"" was over. This book plainly explains why the ""Ku Klux Klan"" HAD to be formed. As the Prologue says, ""Had there been no rule of the tyrannical, corrupt carpetbagger or scalawag rule, there would have been no secret organizations."" This book should be taught in every Southern school, because it is as revelant for 2012 as it was back in 1866-1871. ""All that the South has ever desired was the Union as established by our forefathers should be preserved and that the government as originally organized should be administered in purity and truth."" --- Gen. Robert E. Lee"
3,Back Fired,"Interesting read. Too bad it was ruined by including smut, filth, porn. It would have been a great book."
1,Needs to be fired,"Unfortunately, this book only adds to the mass amount of unrealistic and sometimes ridiculous views of conservatives, republicans, and ""people of faith"". On a further note, Mr. Federer (On a personal level) has more extreme views coming to from the ""lovely left wing"". In his perfect world, Mr. Federer would set back woman's rights nearly 100 years. Any type of sexual activity outside of marriage would be punishable by the death penalty. And, everyone would firmly believe that Jesus will come back from the dead (A second time) and take only the ""good Christians"" to heaven. As you can see, I'm exaggerating but, I feel it is necessary to contrast his event more massive exaggerations from the other end of the spectrum. In conclusion, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! In fact, do an audio search on the comedian George Carlin, he is much more accurate on these issues than Mr. Federer."
3,"A cautionary tale, NOT a pick-up book","This is an engaging, quick read. I can't say all, or even very much, of the actual story is believable, but we can just call it a memoir and avoid casting any nasty aspersions of falsehood.Most striking is the palpable emptiness of the ""Artists"" that the author does a good job of sending across. But don't look for a real moral here- as the author waves you away with one hand, he beckons you closer with tales of raunchy sex-on-demand and impossible pick-ups that put both Cassanova and James Bond to shame.Ultimately a tale of rejects and geeks who find a niche for themselves by discovering there's no real benefit to being shy or fearing rejection. Well-told enough to keep you reading, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the author on Oprah in a few years apologizing for large stretches of embellishment."
5,Unbelievable... a MUST READ,"For those of you unfamiliar with Neil Strauss or The Game, consider yourselves extremely lucky for stumbling upon this book. Not only will Neil take you through his own extraordinary, fascinating journey in this one of a kind read, but by doing so he also reveals some of the secrets he actually uses to get the level of mastery in pick up, becoming a pick up guru. Any guy interested in women should have this book sitting in their home - plain and simple. Easily one of the most interesting reads I have ever come across."
3,meh,"like others have said, this book is definitely more about the tale neil has to tell than his writing. the fact is, this is a poorly written book. it's odd... there's one chapter written by a teacher of neil's named ""juggler"", which is superbly written. i would truly love to read a whole book by THAT guy. anyways, the story is good vicarious fun and there is some genuinely valuable wisdom to be gleaned. the ""3 second rule"" in particular, which is probably the single best thing to keep in mind when trying to meet a girl. good gift for a guy friend or your grandpa."
1,Weak,"If you are the type who is extremely shy and never gets any attention, this may be a worth while playbook, otherwise, it's worth a chuckle at most. I actually felt sorry for these guys after reading it."
4,Actually a story book,"this is a story book. Although i almost didnt learn anything from it, considering its size, i could have a good knowledge about who is who in the seduction comunnity and it makes you want to learn the ""routines"" that Neil is always mentioning."
4,Spitting game to girls,"This is an entertaining piece of literature. Neil Strauss writes of nights going out, opening conversations with girls (after talking to their friends while ignoring them initially), demonstarting value while entertaining them, and making them fall for you. A good book to enjoy as a guy as long as you don't go overboard and become a male pig and whore."
5,Great book,"When I started reading this book, I had a little different expectations of it. I thought that ""The Game"" was largely about pick-up art and how to be good at it. Probably lots of guys hearing about this book think the same thing and get a little disappointed when they see that it's not just guide lines for being good with women. Here you might definitely find some advices, pick up lines and all, but this book is really more than just that.Despite being a good read in general ( and yes, I do think that Neil Strauss is a good writer ), this book is a big in site on what you might face if you desire to enter a community of PUAs , what people you might encounter, feelings you might develop and so on.From here you will definitely be able to learn the masters of the community just so you'll know whose material to trust.So on my opinion, this book is great, and if you are a guy that has any thought of becoming a purchase or just has a wish for self improvement socially, that's a must read."
4,Pretty good overall,This book was pretty useful in explaining broad concepts but it would have been better to see more specifics on techniques and a comprehensive list of other reading materials.
5,changed my life,"There are 3 ways to to read into what is written - 1. as a story of one mans life or part of. 2. As an introduction to the lifestle of pickup artists. or 3 - a deeper look at your self and what you can acheive by making changes to how you dress, how you walk, how you talk, how you relate to other people. This book can be used to change your ife, regardless of what your marital status. It will open your eyes to what you are capable of. Neil shows you what every body is attracted to, regardless of sex, status, race. Its not about becoming a sex god or pick up artist, why people are attracted to the alpha male. The sex god is a consequence of becoming an alpha male. Read into what is written and you will get a lot more out of it. At worst, it is a bloody good read."
5,Hilarious book!,"Book came in good time and in great condition, so overall good service.The book itself is absolutely hilarious. You'll be laughing and learning a lot. Neil Strauss makes fun of Mystery (host of MTV's ""The Pick-Up Artist"")a lot. He also talks a bit about his and other gurus' methods of picking up chicks, what he believes works and doesn't work. Incredibly interesting and entertaining. Also, try ""Rules of the Game"" by Neil Strauss for a good sequel."
4,Funny but True,"Completely reflective of any successful pickup attempt ever made. Takes freak incidents chalked up to a player's luck and makes it an artform with sequenced rules to playing the game. Still not peacocking, but I understand."
5,Highly Entertaining,"Is this book truely real life? Who cares! This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. This book outlines a man's personal life as well as giving light the the underground online dating community. The dating advice given in this book does work, however it can lead to self destruction, something that is well documented cover to cover. Read it, learn, and laugh."
5,The way to penetrate and get the prize.,"I didnt want to like this book. The author speaks of a society of pickup artists that exists, that I thought was bull, but apparently does indeed exist. The approaches that Neil describes, when wanting to pick up woment all boil down to having confidence and charm and the willingness to fail, be rejected and pick yourself up again. The details in this book is what encouraged the 5 start rating from me. The author has detailed a process, that I think, could not have been written without firsthand experience."
5,Demonstrate Value....,"For those wanting to improve their status with the fairer sex, this book has it all. The Game does not take you by the hand in a step by step format; rather it provides the parameters in which to work with in social settings. Even if you do not envision yourself as a ladies man, Mr. Strauss is one hell of a writer. You will not put this book down once you open it, I promise."
1,"If you like exaggerations & poor writing skills, you might like this misogynist book.","I really cant believe that someone would want to read this book.(although I did, from a recommendation) Its full of poorly developed characters and not any substance to it. Its such a boring read, about the LA pickup artists in VIP rooms, etc. etc. Its not even a congruent story line. If I where to compare it to a movie, the movie would be Gigli. Save your money and get an entertaining read at least."
1,Get a life,"Tired of hollow, lame women? Then throw away this book and get a real life. Do something else and stop being pathetic. Climb a mountain or find something you love to do. Get an education. If you actually have some substance, there are tons of interesting, beautiful women out there who are just looking for someone who has a life. It's sooo easy!"
2,SECRET eh? give me a freakin break,"I would like to be kind. Since I admire the creative work of writers. It's something I certainly can't do well. However, something about the book didn't sit right with me. Now coming here, I know why. Most the books ""secrets"" - and even Characters and story line - are already plastered on various forums, etc,all over the net. For free! Just do a search. So the book is an elaborate copy and paste affair.And the only true secret I find, is who is the most agressive marketer here . Look around - Im a bit shocked that everyone in the ""book"" is here waiting for you to drop your money. For that I will have to take 1 star off my review. In my humble opinion - this is really an informational of sorts, NOT a legitamate book. Amazon I believe your TOS says no url posting allowed, why are you permitting this carnival of sales people here? Memo to Neil Strauss - please try for more credibility next time - you need it."
1,another boring pickup book,"This is ""NOT"" a book to pickup women nor does it give any pickup lines. Its about a bunch of guys get together and tell about there darkside. If you are looking for pickup lines watch ""hitch"". After the first couple of pages i fell asleep. I wasted $25 on this book. If you are looking for style pickup women watch james bond."
1,Beyond Terrible,"This book and all characters within are utterly pathetic. I thought this would be an interesting look into the minds of men, some psychology, sociology, etc.Who are these tools, and where do they find women dumb enough to hook up with them.Cheese, cheese, and more cheese. I felt embarrassed for these people as I read.Don't waste your money!!!!"
4,The game,This book was great. I normally hate to read a book with that many pages but when i started reading this book I could not put it down.
1,Ughhhhh!,Not sure who are all those that gave this book high marks. After reading the Reddit AMA with Neil Strauss I thought this would be a fun read or listen as I purchased the audio book. It's not fun. It's brutal. The best way to describe it? It's what 16 year old David Copperfield thought picking up 20 year olds in clubs was like as written by an 18 year old. If you're 16 you might enjoy this and I guess that's why most of Reddit thought it was good.
1,Fiction,"I saw Neil Strauss who is a bald headed geek interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel Live and was intriqued that someone who looked like that could do what he said so I bought the book. I don't believe a word he says or writes about scoring with women. He couldn't get laid in a whorehouse with a bag full of hundred dollar bills. I do however, respect that he has gotten rich and famous in the competitive world of writing and the tough world of show business."
1,Just stories.,"Its just a bunch of stories of this one guy, if you really want to attract women, be yourself. This guys crap with only end with you in a divorce or a failed date."
3,This book aint no blueprint for success. I wish it were,"I tried some of the suggested methods in the book. They didn't work, at least not exactly. I did get a few positive responses. Well, let me put it this way: ""The sex you want, you aren't getting, and the sex you're getting , you don't want..."""
4,I usually don't read..,"Many people believe that this book is about how to pick up women etc. etc.However it does have it's ups and motives, This book serves more of a casual read about a certain 'someone' and their life experiences.It's told more in a story tone. Don't buy this if you're looking for a 'how-to' guide."
3,Ok for casual reading,"This book offers little in the way of advice on the art of picking up on women, but is more of a casual reading book."
1,Garbage,I purchased this book based on the all the reviews listed on Amazon. Are these reviews from independent readers or are these people affiliated with this author? I found this book to lack substance and does not provide pick up techniques i was expecting. If you like to read about a group of PUA'S and their shallow private life style then buy this book. The author has no in depth study on female psychology or any academic credentials. He is one of many PUA'S trying to explain techniques and make a buck. It was absolutely disappointing and a waste of time.
2,Mindlessly boring,"The cover of this book captured my attention at a bookstore. It is covered like a Bible but it is about the dating game. So I perused through few pages and decided to buy it on Amazon.I was really disappointed this book was ONLY about mindless stories of picking up women. You can call it case studies of supposed studs picking up women in LA. After about 100 pages, I realized the whole book was about stories of picking up women, and I still had another 230 pages to go. You can only write so many different stories of the same topic and still be intersting.What is sorely lacking is any real understanding of relationship between men and women. Sure, the book provides some insights into picking up women, but anyone who has been in some relationships know picking up women is always the easy part.This book has 331 pages of mindless stories of picking up women which is not even the most challenging aspect of relationship between a man and a woman."
3,Not What You'd Think,"I have no real negative opinions of the book, per say, however the book is advertised as more of a ""how to"" manual than a story of this portion of the authors life, which it is. This is not what the buyer may think at first glance."
5,Great book!,"I'm a girl and I loved this book. For the guy who needs it, it will give all the right advice. For the girl, it will help you spot the ones who are just looking for a good time verses the ones who are really just trying to get a conversation started. At any rate, it's terrific insight into the male psyche."
4,As Style might say - 'Awesome',"Truely a great read - it will make you think . . and not just about approaching women with the aim of seducing them. It goes to the heart of how people are perceived in the daily interaction with others, and how you might influence that interaction to your advantage. The benefits of this obviously have broad appeal in the business world, your career and all of your relationships, whether with new people, friends or family.However, it's not simply some self help kind of book, it goes a lot deeper than that. It's full of well developed characters - who happen to be real people, but not celebs - so it's got a reality TV like drama to it - no simple plot lines with a happy ending - just real people and what they get up to when they devote most of their existance to the singular pursuit of winning over women. It also gives some insight to our own inner workings, our insecurities and how they can affect our approach to life."
4,A fun read.,"Don't buy ths book if you want to learn how to improve your technique. This is not a how-to book. On the other hand, if you want to learn about the lives of elite pickup artists with all their ups and downs (lots of downs) or you are aspiring to become one youself, this book will be a fun and entertaining read. Was it all for real? Probably as far as autobiographies go...if you know what I mean. The book itself is a pretty light read, so it goes by pretty quick."
2,Bulls*** for Kids,"These guys use fake lip rings, wigs, hats, scarfs and other Bulls*** to look like the Peacock in the room.If that is what you are willing to do to bed a girl, think of what kind of idiot girl you are going to end up with.There are some interesting elements regarding giving negative responses immediately when a girl gives you an uninviting indication. There is some merit in this book.It might be worth the read for some insight, but not the end all novel."
5,The Game,This was a very good buy! It had a lot of very interesting stories that you could reflect on your everyday life. Neil is a very good author and will continue to purchase his novels.
4,A good read!,"I had heard about this book for years and decided it was finally time to read it.It is a very good read and an entertaing book. Although some of the strategies/methods they use seem to be geared towards a younger crowd 20's - 30's, sadly, are true of many women. Women have a very strange psychology and attraction strategies.One thing I like most is that when you are confident in approaching and attracting women then you won't put up with some woman's BS and she'll pick up on that. She's value in that, she'll detect you won't tolerate it, don't need it and she won't act like a little brat so much.This book discusses some very basic yet true principles that are constant between men and women. I haven't finished the book as of yet, I am about half way done, and although they seem to be good at attracting women the book does not discuss how to keep one and have a relationship. But that's not why we're buying the book, is it? So, just know that going in."
3,Game Review,The book was a 3.5 out of 5. The book mostly consisted of stories of their experiences with the game. If you're looking for a How to book for the game I highly recommend buy The Mystery Method instead of this book.
4,Women Will Learn............,From this book as well...I can recall various situations in my life that were similiar to what what Mr Strauss wrote....Author Of:Black Women Deserve Better
3,the Game,I bought this book to learn about people but learned that these people are sharks praying on people's social weak points. In the process they are poisoning themselves.
5,Exelent,"The book was given to me by a friend, Ever since i started reading it i just wanted to know more of the drama and life for Mystery and Style, From student to Guru, Neil Strauss is a legend........"
4,A Journey into a secret society,"I read this book thinking it would be a guide or how-to. I must say I'm very happy it wasn't.It describes the journey of a nerd writer into the society of pick up artists. It describes the good and the bad times. It narrates the trips they had through europe and the good times at project hollywood.It's an entertaining read until you reach the final pages. When he falls in love with Lisa. In my opinion he should've kept doing what he did best. But regardless, it's an entertaining read."
5,Compelling story- along with self help,A great compelling story along with tons of up and down moments that makes for a great story. It also gives instant confidence to (AFC's) Average frustrated chumps.
3,Abridged too much,"I enjoy the game-related titles by Strauss and Mystery and others and my boyfriend reads them all the time. Nope, I'm not worried, he is faithful. But both of us read Strauss's book before he got this abridged audiobook for his borther. We listened to it after his brother came to us with scores of questions and we immediately saw why - the abridgement is weak, too much detail is skipped, and a lot of the techniques of The Game are omitted for brevity in the audio book. If you are unfamiliar with Mystery's method, you should NOT begin with this abridgement but get the unabridged version of the book or audiobook (if the unabridgement is available in audiobook format)."
3,it's the lick of the spoon,I read the Game after some guys I knew told me it changed their life. People need to keep in mind that there's a sucker born every minute and that anyone can write anything to make money. Self proclaimed masters like Neill Strauss and Ross Jeffries are greater masters of getting into men's wallets than women's panties. I don't really care for how much books like this reduce social interaction and I feel they can really cheapen the reader but it does illustrate some useful scenarios. I'm not a man and can't say that it doesn't work. I actually think that these little methods are a bit like cognitive behavioral therapy and can break down shyness and anxiety. Maybe it does work and can even improve a person's superficial social skills in other social arenas. But if you expect the Game will transform you you into a lothario you should probably get your head checked.
5,face magnet,"i couldnt stop reading this book once i got started and was a lil bit sad and confused about what i should do next after it ended. This book opened up so many different ideas in my life from religion to seduction to living in different parts of the world to thinking about picking up many skills and job ideas; the game really had me thinking about my own life and what i should do with it next.good read, 5 stars, and a new favorite author."
1,Strongly sounds like it was written by a high school boy who masturbated with one arm and wrote this book with the other!,Strongly sounds like it was written by a high school boy who masturbated with one arm and wrote this book with the other! Very bad advice for men.
1,Ugh !!,"Maybe if men tried using some basic human qualities like decency, kindness and concern towards women - they would find themselves 'lucky' all around. It's just not that complicated - nor should it be.Sorry - the book is a waste of resources and time...."
1,unhappy,"I would love to review this book but it has been more than a month since I ordered it and have yet to receive it. I inquired about when it would arrive and Amazon said that they forwarded my email to the publisher but I have not gotten the book nor any answer from the publisher.I can, however, give you a review of the service I have received in two words; it sucks."
1,Wait for the Movie,"If you like to watch the TV shows ""Friends"", ""Coupling"", ""How I met your mother"", ""Sex in the City"", ""The Single Guy"" or ""Nova"" and you're looking for a story to read, than this book is for you.If you haven't read a book for pleasure for a long time but your looking for a ""How To"" book, then this book isn't for you. Read the book ""The Sensuous Man"" instead.I listened to Neil Strauss at a book signing. He ""tours"" with self proclaimed losers who call them themselves former losers who sell ""How To Pickup Women"" services. They sell nothing but air --- and that's free.If you're looking for a story but not a book reader, wait for the movie coming to theaters in 2008."
2,They make it sound so complicated!,"Women like successful men. Dress like you have a career, quote an important job title and girls will come to you. There is really no need to get into all the 500 pages on how to get laid when just wearing a stethoscope around your neck will get you laid faster.Apart from that, once on a date don't be boring and act like a gentleman. Sense of humor will improve her mood and she will associate that with you. Being a gentleman will appeal to the primitive sides of her brain. If you are caring and respectful to her, you will be a good father and husband. You are the right one to raise her kids.Finally, every technique will work sometimes. The problem is that acting like a bad boy or a macho man may very well attract to you women with some serious mental issues. And for what... when there are plenty of beautiful normal girls out there?"
1,Seriously LAME,"I gave some thought to purchasing this book after reading Tucker Max's ""I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell"". I never would have figured it's a book on how to turn yourself from a social outcast into a player...by using magic tricks. Wow can you get any lamer? Do you honestly think that pulling a quarter out from behind your ear is going to get you women, you mine as well dress up in your star trek outfit and head out to the bars...don't forget your pointy ears.Suggestion: Don't waste your money, I'd rate it lower if I could."
3,Not quite applicable in real life?,"I've only read through about a third of the book, but I feel that I've gained enough insight into the general direction that the book is heading in. I like the occasional humorous burst and the smart comments here and there, but honestly, the tricks that are used in this ""auto-biography"" are a little extreme. I grabbed this book based off of a friend's recommendation for it being a good read of a different flavor and often times offering a comical approach and a certain ""wow"" factor of the author's transformation to a pick-up artist. Good thing that was just what I was expecting because it was what I got.Pick up the book if you want something different to read... but if you want to meet women, maybe the best way to do that is to turn off your computer and go out and meet some."
5,GREATEST BOOK EVER FOR THE AFC,"Reading The Game by Neill Strauss was truly a pleasure. It is a fascinating story of a man who starts out like the average joe or AFC (average frustrated chump) and becomes a mPUA (master pick up artist). The stories of meeting beautiful women and seducing them appear very authentic. The journey of this author is a very interesting one, and I can only hope there's a sequel! I've already read it twice and probably will again because it opened my eyes to a seduction community that most people didn't know previously. Strauss is an amazing storyteller, and gives men the most valuable information that one could ever have - how to seduce the hottest women in the planet!!!"
1,Sad,"Shallow, stupid people successfully pursue other shallow, stupid people. Great storyline! I can only hope that my son, when he's grown, won't regard himself or women as lowly as the ""PUA's"" do, and that my daughters will be able to spot empty-headed, sleazeball opportunists like this from a mile away. This book, when read between the lines, might have a purpose, though, in that it's a bleak reminder that young people are desperately in need of finding some legitimate meaning to life (and, no, I don't mean endless sex partners)."
1,There is no magic pills!,"I think that Neil Strauss wasn't really a nice guy or a nerd and that he had a lot of social proof just by being himself: a guy who knows famous people.The book the game just paces extremely well the reality of most guys who are bad with women. And he was very good at that!When you paces the ongoing reality of another person then they're ready to be led into your world.What was Neil Strauss's world? self promotion and promotion of guys like Deangelo, Zan, David X, Steve Piccus, Hypnotica, Tyler Durden, Juggler (Wayne Elise) and, of course, Mystery!If you want to have success:1 - pace a fundamental need that isn't fulfilled in the life of a lot of people.2 - Then, offer a kind of solution in exchange of money (even if it doesn't work), and you'll get money.I threw my copy of this book away."
2,lame,"This is just an attempt to gain popularity and the mechanisms in this book are childish, but the overall premise is the same if people can get past the pony show. Just be open and confident and you should be fine."
5,The Game,Purchased as a gift for my Godson. He was very pleased with the book - very interesting and informative.
3,Entertaining but not much value,"I am giving this book three stars for entertainment purposes only.This book is definitely entertaining but reads like a fiction. Do not use the author's approaches to meet quality women. In this book he generally meets bimbos and women who are looking for a one night stands.If you want a quality, respectful woman, using auther's approaches you will fail terribly. To meet a woman among other things you need to be articulate, respectful, charismatic, clean cut and use some common sense.As long as you execute those judgements you will be as successful as this writer in meeting quality women."
3,Around the World in 80 Babes,"I'd also recommend Around The World in 80 Babes! -- the classic tale of Nige 54 and his adventures meeting women and showing them a good time. Unlike many guys who are all talk and only think they know how to meet women, through his story, Nige 54 imparts the required insight and strategy that other guys can actually use to maximize their success. In contrast to ""The Game,"" which painted a very negative picture of the whole seduction community, Around The World in 80 Babes! motivates and inspires every guy out there to make some changes and start living the ""54"" way.Matt"
3,Amusing,"I am not sure if the average guy would really want to study and apply the things that are being ""taught"" in this book, but it is very amusing. I only finished about half of it, because it started to get repetitive. But I really enjoyed the first half. The guy is a good writer, so he is very good at bringing the odd characters in this sub-culture to life and retelling some of their adventures."
4,The game cleared up almost everything,"I started reading this book and my reality was smached in the first couple pages of this read. I was very excited to work the new idea's that i learned. when i went out to the ""Field"" and tryed this stuff i was very surprised by how well it really can work for you once you get a good feel for it. I would very much recemmond this book to anyone who wants to improve their success with women."
3,This is not a book about picking up women...,"...instead this is a book about the people in the PUA (pickup artist) culture, most of whom developed their ""culture"" only after becoming rich selling PUA books. It provides you insight into their lives, and that's about it. The table of contents is deceptive, because the book is organized as if it were about attracting women. Don't be fooled. If you want to learn how to pickup women, find a different book from one of the myriad of PUA authors out there. There is some good material out there about technique, but this particular book just isn't it."
3,Scoremanship is better,i read abook back in the 70s that was a lot better its called scoremanship. this book could have been better. get scoremanship for better tips. if you can find it.
5,Great! Great! Great!,"This is the best book I've ever read! Honestly! It has sent me on such a journey and changed my life so much in the short time since I first opened it. Don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just a book about picking up women. You would be wrong! This is a book about life, men, women, social dynamics, decision making and so much more. I encourage you to get this book. You will not regret it. This is one book that has definately lived up to the hype. It goes great with Mystery Method. But Read this one first. It will help you to better understand MM.BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,The Best Book On The Topic,"Combining actual pick-up routines with a good story made this an enjoyable read. It contains some sound advice on keeping these skills and lifestyle under control. My only complaint was the last third of the book where it seemed to take forever to resolve a fairly simple story line. However, the author salvages this somewhat by tossing in some diversionary chapters that range from the hilarious to the grim. I'd give this book to my son when he leaves home. Use a highlighter so you can quickly review before you go out on the town!"
4,recommended,"I bought this book on referral from a friend who spends weekends trying to 'pickup'. I'm glad I took his advice. This book can be taken in two ways, on the surface its a eye opening and at times hallarious account of Neil Strauss' journey to becoming a PUA. For guys who want to know what it takes to get the woman they really want its a source of inspiration and information. But you can also take a deeper look at what this book means to you, if you look closer the book speaks volumes on human interaction in general, how to best market yourself and impress people (well mainly women!) I found myself laughing out loud in some parts. At best it challenges the way you think about women and how you interact with them, at worst its an easy, funny read."
1,A Book For The Socially Crippled.,I Don't Recommend this Book if you:ever had sex.ever gone clubbing.ever made out with people.this book resembles a late night infomercial.
2,Mindless reading if you need something to help you go to sleep,"I watched the TV series and ordered the book. I gave it a good try, but got about 100 pages into it and quite honestly, became annoyed with the authors style and threw it away. Lot's of stories about nothing."
5,Awesome!,This book was well worth the money. It is beautifully written that keeps you interested and slightly giddy. It's an amazing book that can help you become the thing every afc has ever wanted to be a pua.
3,"Interesting, but of little value","Overall the book is interesting to read. It's part instructional, part quasi-fictional. I am not saying that the book is fiction, but it reads like fiction, and this quality makes it interesting. However, the beginning chapters reveal PUA information and I felt like I had made a good decision in purchasing the book, but the useable information starts to become scarce as the book goes on and I found myself reading one chapter after another thinking that they all seemed very similar. Too much investment with too little payoff. I'm not disappointed in the purchase, but if you're on a fact finding mission, start with the Mystery Method book written by Mystery. Much more technical and less fluff."
4,"Interesting and well-written, a solid contribution","I read 'Emergency' first and came to this book as a fan of the author. While some people quibble over the nature of the content, to me this is a solid non-fiction work and the author is talented.The author spins a good yarn and while the stories can seem somewhat crazy, the characters all come into focus as real humans living in a different strata of society than most. I have no interest in practicing the pickup arts but the author makes a solid case for the contributions they can make to all form of social interactions.I'll continue to follow-up on this author's bibliography because I find the writing to be concise and journalistic. Also, for those interested, the author is a good reader/narrator as well, if you decide to go with the audiobook."
2,"Not a how-to guide, but a journal of another man's jouney to male slutdom...","I bought this book after hearing numerous positive reviews. However, now that I look back, this book had little to do with actually helping my ""game"". You learn a few new volcabulary words, and have a few ""Aha..!"" moments, but nothing I found particularly useful in my situations. It gives an overall synopsis of what must be done, but no wisdom to guide it. In fact, I found it a bit insulting and slightly misleading. It SAYS penetrating the secrets, and shows his journey to become what he is now, but the book contains very few of those secrets. Kind of like a Magician Guide, which says you have to be quick, smooth, and charming, yet doesn't reveal the gimick of the trick. Sorta wish I spent my money on something that actually gives me facts and causes (like Carlos Xuma explains...which, BTW, I am skeptical of his book as well)."
1,This book will find a new home on top of your toilet stall.,"I had high hopes for this book. I was even a bit anxious to read it because I was so excited...until I read it.Style's writing is very bland. If I had to sum up his storytelling, it would go something like this: Okay I see a hot blonde in the club, next I need to use one of my lame pick up openers (Did you see the two girls fighting earlier?), then I need a gimmick to entice her even more (Want to see a magic trick?), then after all that she either gives me a number or brushes me off.I can't imagine any girl falling for Style's techniques. The girl would have to be deemed mentally retarded to be aroused by his approach. If The Game were made into a movie, I would say it would par with 300 or Clash of the Titans. A 100 million dollar budget with nothing to say."
2,Not my up of tea,An interesting story about desperate men seeking to enhance their egos by their conqusts over women. A rather shallow indictment of our society in my opinion but does reflect the real and disturbing world of PUA (pick up artists) and their techniques.
2,This book should be retitled: How to be a Douche Bag,"I read this book and found it's only value was entertainment. Sure Neil's stories were funny and entertaining, however one word came to my mind when reading about the characters of this book - they are all douche bags. Their advice is doing one thing that our world needs less of: 40+ year old immature guys trying to be something that they aren't. One of his key elements of advice is to speak negatively to the girl you are after, I think I remember doing that in middle school. My advice is to be yourself, and be kind and real with people - it will always win out in the end."
5,The world as we know it....,"One can not help but have your curiosity peeked when reading scathing reviews by what I simply can only see as those with an agenda.A friend happened to have this book while we were on a business trip and was high lighting several section with a highlight marker. Sitting right next to him I had no clue what this book was and at initial glance....I thought it was a Bible. LOLThus, my introduction to ...The Game. Strauss does a awesome job of introducing the reader to this world of seduction, his metamorphosis so to speak as he traverses its world. From less then successful with the girls onto mastering the so called art of seduction... and becomes in the end.....just a guy, comfortable in his own skin."
4,"An interesting read, but not a manual","I don't know about the appeal of this book to women. Many people, some men included, may find it offensive. If you're socially conservative, you may want to steer clear.Strauss is an excellent writer and this book is very engaging. It's a story about his own personal foray into the world of pickup artists. I don't know whether it's all true or not, but it doesn't matter much. If you read this book as an engrossing story, it's a page turner.If you're looking for a manual on seduction or pick-ups, this may not be the best place to start. If the information in it is true, it may be a good history manual, bibliography, and rough guide. There are probably better pick-up manuals that you can get, including lots of information on the Internet."
1,The Game + The Rules = The end of humanity!,"[...]BAM!And you know what's interesting? If all men played The Game and all women followed The Rules, nobody would ever hook up! The Game teaches men to be aloof. The Rules teaches women to both be aloof and to write off men who are aloof. All humanity following these books would be the end of the species! D:"
4,This book isn't what you might think,"The book has very little about technique, it's more of a mini soap opera of what happens when you get a bunch of self-described pickup artists into the same space, as seen by the author, an outsider who masters their technqies, of which we learn very little. In the end, the outsider wins the girl who deflects almost all of the ""techniques"" he attempts, and the other pick up artists end up alone, because in the end, they are still the losers that required them to learn all this trickery in the first place. Despite their initial success, they have nothing to offer the gals they pick up.Which is fine because the gals who allow the techniques to work have nothing to offer themselves. So in the end, it's just a depressing account of these guys lives. It's a compelling book and one I'd recommend."
2,MORE LIKE A STORY NOVEL THAN A PICK UP STRATEGY GUIDE,"OK true that this book was very attractive from the way it looked (the cover and all). But as I began reading it desiring some techniques that might be found on this book about how to pick up women, clearly it was nothing more than a story novel.True the ""story"" has some detailed bits and tactics and ideas about how the Mystery Method explains, but this is definitely not a HOW TO guide.....I was actually reading to find strategies, yet only realized there was really nothing left but stories like a novel book.....I have Robert Greene's book SEDUCTION....Now there is a how to guide for you..."
5,Funny and insite full,"Funniest book i have read ina while. Not only that, it lead me to purchase the Mystery book, The Mystery Method. Neil (style) did one hell of a job in describing his adventures (sarges) and the community itself, showing some of the greatest attributes as well as its pitfalls. I plan on purchasing other books by Neil."
2,Basically a bragging biography of the author's conquests,"The information in this book would consist of maybe ten or twelve pages. The rest of the book is just stories of the author's and his friend's conquests. I will admit, the ""bible-like"" construction of the book is neat.Good marketing doesn't equal good reading. I'm surprised at all the raving reviews. Reading about a tiny, bald, skinny man getting laid isn't why I was interested in the book. I was looking for advice on talking to girls, and dating. There was very little substance in this best-seller.The first few chapters had some tips, but mostly tricks. The rest of the book was a boring and tedious read."
3,"A Light, Silly, Fun Read. Some very cool conversations with the honeys","Enjoyed this book!I was hooked after reading the first 5 pages, and then lost steam around half way through the book.Its entertaining and inspires jealousy to see guys open with women so easily and comfortably. Its got some really cool opening lines which one could definitely try out.I would say that Strauss gets a little over the top with the 'Peacocking' and 'Magicians' and the 'NLP' techniques in the book which goes on to show how some guys hypnotise their way to seduction. That was a bit much for me, which kind of sidestepped reality and practicality. I mean seriously, are you going to go into a bar and start pulling rabbits out of your hat to try and seduce a woman?But I will say that i'm definitely looking forward to testing some parts of the book. Although in India, where I'm from, I will probably be arrested, or shot for hitting on a woman.I'd recommend this book. Its Fun."
1,Where is the virtue? Don't look here.,"The discovery of this book in our home just forced a discussion with our teenage sons, one of whom bought the book and demanded it's return or compensation for the purchase price. We opted to reimburse him and discuss the book's relative merits.I acknowledge the challenge that unattached men experience when pursuing women. The problem with this book is the goal. It is NOT, by the authors own admission, the pursuit of a long term relationship. Nor is it, by my deduction, the pursuit of a virtuous relationship. It attempts to lure susceptible men into thinking that even written pornography is worthy of praise.Bottom line, this book passes pornography for humor and it cheapens the sacred union of a man and woman."
2,Hoobely Doobely,"Ok fellas let me break it down for ya's. If you try the stuff in this book you arn't doing yourself any favours. If I heard someone come up to me trying this stuff I'll probably laugh my self to death.And if there are any other girls out there thinking about getting this book I'll just warn you that it is embarassingly hard to read at times. You really do feel for the fellas out there who are willing to try anything. While this book isn't supposed to be portrayed this way, if your a woman it reads like a tradgedy, of how men are willing to try anything - even if its a load of hoobely doobely."
3,Not for beginners or even intermediate daters,This is book is very funny actually especially if you watched the television show on VH1 when it was running. The ideas for picking up women in this book are for advanced daters. The big problem is that TOO many people have heard about this book and its techniques and women just laugh because they know you're trying out the techniques.
2,How much of this is fiction?,"This book is somewhat entertaining, but almost certainly contains some fiction, and there's little a reader can do to separate the facts from the fiction. The author reports routinely inventing stories to pick up women, and since that works at least as well for selling books as it does for picking up women, anyone should expect him to invent a bunch of stories to make the book interesting. But it doesn't have a good enough plot to qualify as a novel."
3,Go into your purchase with your eyes open.,"A lot of the press that this book gets bills it as a ""how to"" guide to picking up women. This book is not a how to, it's a chronicle. You will not find step-by-step instruction, you will find a story. I won't judge the truthfulness of the story because I wasn't there to observe it. Further warning: you may not enjoy this book if you don't have a slightly machiavellian personality. If you're not at all that way, you'll be disgusted by the events described; if you're more than just slightly machiavellian, you'll be disapointed by the ending. As a story, I find ""The Game"" to be very good, as a how-to book, it is poor, hence the average rating."
5,Man's Sex in the City,"I think this is essential reading for every male who has trouble with women. Whether it's just talking to them, getting a date, or just having confidence.Women have things like Cosmo, Sex in the City, etc. Which tell women how to interact with different types of men. Guy have to figure it all out on their own. This is our guide.Neil tells of his own journey from frustrated chump who can't talk to women to the best pick up artist in the world. His story shows us it's possible for anyone to change themselves and improve their lifestyle."
2,not that great,"while the tripod is of acceptable quality,(as long as you have a table)the telescope has lots of cheaply made parts.the eyepieces are plastic and the focuser is wobbly.not very durable, the dewcap broke on the first night.the lens was a single piece of plastic.(should be made of 2 or more pieces of glass).very tiny aperture , made worse by plastic stop just behind the lens, which cuts the aperture down to just 1 cm.not recommended if you actually want to see something.final advise: save your money and get the orion funscope(also available on amazon)."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my 5 year old on the basis of an earlier review. I was very disappointed. The product looked very cheap. After I had gotten it, I saw other telescopes for the same price that looked much less like a toy. The tripod is very short and has to be sat on a table or desk to be useful. I would not recommend it if you are looking for a sturdy beginner product rather than just another toy."
1,Not so great.,"You ever been to a birthday party where the kid gets something that needs to be put together? The adult in charge cant seem to get it working fast enough before all the other Einsteins in the room start saying, ""Give it to me, I'll fix it""? Well this toy is one of those things, where none of us could see anything out of it, and it just kept being passed around, until no one was left. Now grant it, we are not a buch of rocket scientists, but if the toy is for a child, it shouldnt be that diffucult. None of us could see anything out of it. Heres my son wanting to look into his telescope, and its junk. Thank goodness it was a clear night, I ended up saying, ""just look up, you can see the stars"" I know he felt cheated, and so did I."
4,Telescope review,"I like it but I have not used it much, hard to hold it still but have not played with it enough to see if legs extend as holding it and focusing is hard to do. Great great value for the money."
1,Not Happy,"I tried to order this CD twice. Both times, I receieved a CD that did not work. Therefore, I am not happy with this purchase. I ended up requesting a refund, and I have not tried to re-order this item."
4,Interesting book and a good resource,"This is an interesting book and a good resource. The book's title in itself truly depicts what happens in a suicidal person. In a way, it's not really the person that kills the self but rather it's the brain and the ""chemical imbalance"" associated with it that causes damage. So can changing the brain chemistry effect a change and save lives? Sure-that's what medication does. This is how psychotherapy works.In Ms. Blauner's book, several ""tricks of the trade"" were discussed. Asking for help, emergency contacts, and keeping a journal are just some of the practical ways of dealing with suicidality. Her ""crisis plan"" is a useful formula that a person should have to avert any self-destructive thoughts or behavior. Likewise, the chapter on spirituality is a gem.Written in a layman's prose, the book stands out in making complicated concepts (such as neuron and electrochemical transmission) more understandable and seemingly ""easy"" concepts, clearer."
1,Dangerous assumptions,"I will start off by admitting I did not read this entire book. As someone who has struggled with severe depression since I was seventeen, the first few chapters made me angry, nauseated, and eventually frightened. This book will serve to fuel prejudice and contempt towards suicidal people, by claiming it's something that can be averted with a lollipop and a pat on the head; a hysterical search for attention. Obviously the writer did have serious emotional difficulties; but most suicides are committed by people with physical, chemical, mental illnesses, as dangerous and as un-asked for as diabetes or cancer. If you want to know WHY, read Kay Redfield Jamison's ""Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide"". If you want to know how to make it go away, I still don't have an answer, and I can't trust anyone who claims there's an easy one."
2,Not So Helpful Overall,"I am thrilled that proceeds from this book are being donated to 1-800-SUICIDE, a very useful resource. It seems the author suffered more from ideation rather than true suicidality; I didn't find any novel ideas for addressing the latter. Many suggestions presuppose the presence of a support system and financial resources, things lacking for many suicidal people. Most of the Tricks are simply common sense and seem trite to a genuinely suicidal reader. Though glad she made it through her difficult times, I'm still looking for a helpful guide for the chronically suicidal folks who are in grave danger of dying at their own hands."
1,Autobiography of a Drama Queen,"I've fought with depression throughout my life, and was looking for a book that might help me better understand why I kept having suicidal thoughts. This book was the wrong choice.The author is not suicidal. Nobody attempts suicide as many times as she claims she has without succeeding. This woman is a drama queen, seeking attention by taking over-the-counter medication and otherwise ""attempting suicide"" by putting on a big show.If you're depressed and/or suicidal, this book will only annoy you. Please don't waste your money. There is a lot of other, preferable information available out there."
1,Panasonic DMR-ES15 failed with U61after 9 months,"Panasonic DMR-ES15 has great features. But if the unit stops workingafter just a few months of use, then what good is that ? And I boughtthis unit brand new.If you're thinking of buying a Panasonic DVD recorder, do yourself a favor and search the internet for this ""U61"" error on PanasonicDVD recorders so you can get an idea of just how many people haveexperienced this problem. It appears it's only a matter of WHEN theDVD recorder will fail, not IF.I researched this unit, but having owned other Panasonic productsin the past, I foolishly focused on it's features."
1,"Purchased, arrived DOA","I purchased the DMR-ES15S because of the seamingly good reviews. However, my unit arrived and it was dead. Plugged it in and nothing, wouldn't even turn on. Called Panasonic and they sent me to a repair shop. Repair shop said I'd have better luck returning it as that particular model has ""lots of problems"". I told repair shop about all the good reviews on it, and they replied, ""yea, when they DO work..."""
2,Panasonic DVD recorder DMR-ES15S,"I will start off by saying when the Panasonic DMR-ES15 was working, it did a great job, good features: watch one channel record another, multi-programming for different shows on different nights/different times, recorded on all types of disk, picture quality good. Over a year, but less than two the DMR-ES15S is dead msg ""Cannot Read Disk"" blank nor pre-recorded nor dvd movies. I too thought Panasonic made a durable product that would last longer. Repair; is to send it back to Elk Groove, IL and $130.00 to repair this unit. I agree with all the other people on how the problem started off, not recording on certain formats, noise as it tried to read a disk and last not reading any disk. This should constitute a RECALL for this unit by Panasonic... for everyone."
3,It's a good product... while it works.,"I was pleased with this DVD-recorder until it broke after a year of use. I sent it to an authorized Panasonic service center and they fixed it. Allegedly the spindle motor was burnt and had to be replaced. In my opinion, I think that one should get at least 3 years of lifetime from a product like this."
4,Works great when it works,"I love the DVD-RAM capability. Unfortunately, I've had some trouble with the ""chasing playback"" feature that is supposed to allow me to watch one show on the disk while recording another. Sometimes the machine freezes up when I use this feature (and a firmware upgrade on their website didn't fix this). But that is a relatively minor problem that I'm willing to live with.What I find more difficult to excuse is Panasonic's shoddy customer service. I'm sure it's great if your only problem is that you're too lazy to read the manual, because when you submit a question you'll get an autoreply from a robot that quotes the manual at you. (And even this takes a while.) Good luck reaching a live human being who will read and understand your question and provide new information."
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"So far it's worked fine - it's easy to program (just like an ""old-fashioned"" VCR) and then records onto DVD's now that VHS tapes are passe. And no rewinding of course. It plays DVD's fine."
2,Destroys Disc's - Read Update,"When I am recording it all of a sudden says it must shut down and power up again. Well shuts down after long grinding noises, starts up and shut down again it does this about 4 times in a row. It destroys about 1 out of every 5 discs. I am using Verbatim DVD-R's. It makes them so you can not record or name titles to them or play them in any other machine except in it. What a waste of money!It also makes a lot of noise which is very annoying when playing a store bought DVD.No eject button on remote and takes anywhere from 20 to 45 seconds to eject a store bought movie. If you have to finalize a disc you just recorded it takes up to 5 minutes.Should be 1 star, but I will give an extra star because of how nice the menu system is and the 1 second record...****UPDATE*****Well, I am on my second unit and I am getting the same problem on this one. Panasonic must have NO quality control what so ever!If I could change this to no stars I would."
1,Panasonic knew the digital transition was coming,"We loved this recorder, had it since May 2007 and it worked great for recording over the air tv until we set up the digital converter box. Turns out the device does not have an ATSC digital tuner. That means we have to change the channel on the tv converter in advance of the program and remember to do so. Apparently, I can get a converter that has a timer and changes channels, but did not know that when I bought my Amazon warns that this does not have an ATSC tuner but Panasonic surely knew that the transition would make the product largely useless. There should be a class action against Panasonic."
1,"Junk, sorry Panasonic","I bought a lot of Panasonic stuff in the past without any problems but the picture quality on this thing is awful, even at the highest quality setting. All I saw were blocky artifacts that seemed to be blinking. I even had the DNR (digital noise reduction) enabled and it didn't help. Most recordings skipped and stuttered at the beginning. I took it back for refund and Best Buy told me this model is known for doing that. I don't see how Panasonic can put their name on this junk. Those cheap $99 recorders you find at Walmart have better quality than this."
2,poor manual and to many buttons,I found the manual poorly writen for me to understand.I also could not comprehend how to use the disc to rerecord.The old VCR was easy to use.I am sorry I ever bought the unit.All I wanted to do was record different programs to watch later in the evening.Maybe there are some other DVD recorders that are easier to use.
5,Recording home movie,I have recorded about 30 hours of home movies from VCR tapes. It has worked very nice. The instructions were very easy to follow and the recorder can use either DVD+R or DVD-R.
4,revue of my new dvd burner,Works great so far. It needs a door open and close on the remote. But wecan get by without it. It took several hours to learn how to use it. Ihave made 25 movie dvds with very few coasters.
4,"Great Recorder, but be careful unplugging it...","I had this for a while, recorded some stuff, and it worked perfectly. Unfortuantely, I am at a school where all the power cords are unplugged over breaks. Unplugging it while it was on caused a clock reset- now it constantly asks me to set the clock.However, there is no menu button on the unit (a major design flaw in my opinion), and ALL remote button presses only cause the display to say ""SET 1."" So, I cannot use the remote, and there is no menu button on the unit, so I cannot preschedule recordings, fix the clock, or anything.After this fiasco, I realized that I have no real desire to record stuff. Even WITH prescheduling you have to always remember to change discs, etc. So, I'm just getting a DVD/VCR combo.As long as you make sure the unit is OFF when you unplug it, there should not be problems. And other than this one design flaw, this unit is perfect. So if recording is your cup of tea, this is a good choice."
2,Panasonic DMR-ES15S DVD Recorder /Player,"On screen menu not very user friendly.Functions take a long time to program.Unit freezes up sometimes(while programng or ejcecting discs)and you have to unplug it for the functions to reset.I think it's a tempermental product.Discs sometimes don't play on other machineseven if ""finalized"" correctly.Not really pleased with this purchase.Picture quality is very good however."
4,Recording NASCAR,"The Panasonic DVD recorder will record both DVD- & DVD+ format and can be played on other DVD players. On the extended mode 8hrs it looses some quality but it is acceptable. Much to my surpriseI found that the recorder held its programing through a lengthy power outage, VERY GOOD!"
2,Do not buy this product until you know what a U61 error is,"There is not a lot to add to what others have said about this unit, except to let anyone know buying this unit that there are a lot of units failing out there. I liked the unit, but it only lasted about 18 months. I got the U61 failure code and it is a physical failure of the DVD unit. You can put it into Google with the model DMR-ES15 (or other Panasonic models)to understand more about the problem. If you are happy paying the going price for a DVD recorder with nice features, but having it last only about 18 months then buy it. Do not buy the unit thinking that it is an isolated problem."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT! I had one to quit working after a week, one to quit after 3 weeks and one to quit after 5 months. This model is not made to last. Each time it made the same sound and after that it would not read a disc."
1,Warranty screw job!!!!!,"I bought this hunk a junk 1yr and 13 days ago. When I first bought it I thought I would really put it to use. Turns out that I barely used it at all. I bought a PS3 about the same time and watch HD movies more than anything. I used the panasonic to burn some shows on a RAM disc about 12 to 15 times. I rarely used it to watch movies. All together It maybe burned 20 shows and movies from tv and played about 10 movies. 13 DAYS AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED IT STOPPED READING THE DISCS!!! Now I know electronics fail now and then, thats not my problem. My problem is that Panaonic wont budge an inch on he 13 days over the warranty. I have DVD players that are 5 yrs. old and are still going strong. This thing was mildy used and took a dump. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
1,Really great....when it works,"Bought this unit almost a year ago. Had all the features I wanted and it worked great for about four months. Then it started ruining DVDs while burning them. Repairs were covered under warranty but had to wait about a week for parts. The problem (as I understand it) was in the circuit board that controls the drive.Time passes...about four months. And the exact same problem arises again. Still covered under warranty and have to wait again about a week for parts.That was almost four months ago. So guess what the unit started to do today? I think I have one week left under warranty protection.In summary, unit will have had the exact same three major problems in a year and ruined dozens of disks and lost countless recorded programs.In four months, I expect the fourth problem incidence will occur then this unit will be heading for the trash heap. Lemons like this unit greatly contribute to the problem of being a ""throw-away society."""
4,DVD+RW,"This is a great DVD Recorder, but please be advised against using DVD+RW to record. After recording onto a Memorex DVD+RW, taking it out of the machine, then putting it back in, the recorder did not recognize the disk and asked for it to be reformatted. Attempts to reformat the disk and record on it again fail. This happened to 3 disks before I called Panasonic. After a half hour on hold, the technician told me that ""we frequently experience problems recording to DVD+RW, try using DVD-RW or DVD-RAM instead""."
1,DO NOT BUY,This product produced a U61 error barely a year after we purchased it therefore the 1 year warranty was up and Panasonic was going to charge us $140 to service a machine that we originally bought new for less than that price. Throughout the year for every 2 DVDs we were able to burn successfully there was one that did not work properly. I'll never buy another panasonic!!
4,Great price!,"My first Panasonic DVD recorder was the DMR-30. I was able to record over 2000 DVDs before it died. The editing feature was also good. My second DVD recorder was this model. It unfortunately did not last half as long before breaking. It also had an editing feature. When I tried to buy another Panasonic DVD recorder I found that all of the current models had no editing mode which makes it worthless if you want to eliminate commercials from a recording. So I bought another recorder that was the same model as my old one at a greatly reduced price. I only gave it 4 stars because it does not have what it needs to record programs when that February 2009 eliminates analog broadcasts. I am hoping that it will work with my cable which is digital. I also gave it 4 stars because I don't know how long it will last. Using the features may seem daunting but once you figure out how to do it, it is really easy. This comes from a very technically challenged female."
2,Barely acceptable,"I gave this unit two stars because I feel it is just barely adequate. After having just ""lost"" four hours of recorded programs (the last four episodes of Survivor) because the damn thing decided it wanted to ""unformat"" the DVD disc, I felt I had to let others know. This is not the first time this has happened. Obviously it cannot be depended upon. Further, it really is not user friendly with easy to understand options presented to make it function. All in all I would not buy this unit again, nor recommend it to others, and am unlikely to replace it with another Panasonic DVD recorder."
1,Already broken,"I was very surprised at how quickly we started having serious problems with this DVD recorder/player. It is currently in the recycling heap. Too bad, we have always had great luck with Panasonic products."
2,Frustrating,"Maybe this recorder is great - that is if you can install it. We have a system with a TV, satellite box and a VCR and wanted to add the recorder to it. We tried with or without VCR, used schemes in the enclosed booklet and online - didn't work. Setup does not see channels and suggests to check the connections. Guess what? They are perfect! Everything else works, but the recorder does not. It didn't want to play our disks either. Panasonic customer support - that virtual attendant that reads recorded messages (hate this!), live person took forever to answer the call and I quit waiting.After two evenings of trying to figure it all out, it all started to look like we paid money and got ourselves a big problem. I am returning the thing back tomorrow, frustrated, disappointed and feeling totally dumb - we never ever had a problem connecting electronics, be it computers, video and audio systems, or sattelite.Maybe this is simply a defective unit, I don't know."
1,Please Help!!,"I have finally succesfully set this up with my TV, Cable Box, and Receiver. It appears to me that I am not able to get any channel higher than 125, is that correct?? My cable box channels go all the way through the 400's......Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!"
2,Panasonic DMR-ES25,"I have had this unit for 3-weeks. It will not let me add in the channel and captions settings of the manual on page 16 of the units manual. It will not learn the channels automatically. It should be note worthy that I had a local electronics store (Circuit City's Firedog) do the set up and installation. The unit also when turned on flashes ""U71"" in the viewing screen. However the manual says nothing of what that means. Thier tech support has been unable to help me as well. I am simply going to have to purchase another brand unit to replace this piece of _ _ _ _."
3,Can it record live TV,I actually have question about this product. I know this a DVD recorder but can it be used to record live TV also like TIVO?Thanks.
2,Daylight Savings Time Change Makes Auto Clock Useless,Having the clock set to automatically set itself (syncs to a pbs station time signal) does not work on this unit any more because the government changed the start of the daylight savings time from April to March. I contacted panasonic about this and they said that the clock would have to be set manually as the automatic setting is hardwired and can't be changed.
3,Not impressed.,Sage had Personal Journals - what a classic. Since then he hasn't impressed me. This album was almost a waste of money.
3,I Wanted To Like This,"Let me start off by saying that I am a FAN of sage francis. I love his music, his words, his ideas, his creativity. I could go on and on giving him praise but this is a review on a cd i found to be dissapointing.Perhaps my hopes were just set too high. After a dissapointing Healthy Distrust album I was ready for Sage to come back and reel me into his world again. It is hard to be critical about something that someone obviously put his heart into but i was unable to find myself being ""caught"" by this album like i have been with so much of his past work. While it is definatly leaps and bounds above A Healthy Distrust, this album is no where near as good as Personal Journals or any of his ..Sick albums"
4,Solid Effort,"Sage Francis returns with a solid effort after the dissapointing ""A Healthy Distrust"", a follow-up to the independent classic ""Personal Journals"". His newest album, ""Human the Death Dance"" reflects the depressed, yet somehow uplifting poetic lyrics that we have come to expect from a Sage Francis project, but the production seems more consistent and catchy than former releases. I give the album 4 stars for being a very good, not great album that will no doubt be a hit with the emo-hip hop heads."
3,"Too much religion, not enough culture","I took an anthropology course in college that used this book, and while it is a good introduction to religions and their similarities and differences, it was lacking (with a few exceptions) in details from an anthropological perspective. Too much history, not enough about what people actually believe and practice. The chapters in the book are written by different ""experts"" and they vary widely in readability, information and cultural examples."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"The sound quality is horrible. I don't have other products to compare this with. But I don't believe you'd expect so much static. I leave my reception ""dock"" only about 2' to 3' away from the headphones and there's static/noise.There is no battery indicator, so after an hour or two of use, the sound will start to flicker out. The recharging cable (plugs in from the dock to the headset) is too short to plug in and use the headphones at the same time. Of course, it doesn't help that the battery life is very short as well.The reason I gave it 2 stars is that when the headset is fully charged, even though there's some noise, it'll be a consistent low noise even if you're 20'-30' away.I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,OK- but not as good of sound as previous models,"I have the older model of these headphones as well. Those work great, but hurt your ears if you wear them too long. I got this set because of the improved design at the ears. These are much more comfortable, but the transmission isn't nearly as robust. The range is about the same, but these lose connection with the transmitter after about 30 to 45 minutes, no matter what. Also, the sound quality has never been as good as the original."
4,Dave,The sizes run small on this -- I wear a 9.5 to 10 shoe and bought a size 11 skate which fits just right. I haven't skated on sharp blades for over 20 years -- it's great(I didn't pay for the extra sharpenning and they are plenty sharp).The boots could be a bit more comfortable especially the upper tong -- but as they break in they are getting more comfortable.I also bought the girls skate for my daughter that is basically the same model and just paid for shipping one time as sold by skatebuys through amazon with one checkout.
2,Too narrow for most men,"My feet should be very normal. Not too wide, not too narrow. Length wise this is just write. But it's too narrow. It's hurts to wear it. I am seeking to see if I could return it."
3,a little disappointed,"a. I bought this product as a gift. After it was given we discovered that there was considerable background noise in the system when using the Iblast.b. Last night, after the giftee requested I return the item, I was informed that it was no longer eligible for refund and was no longer offered in by Amazon so I couldn't offer it for sale on line.c. I'm thinking I would have better off to have paid more and ordered from Hammecher Schlemer with their no questions asked return policy."
1,"New Copy of Handbook of Research Design and Social Measurement, not...","The condition of this item was not new as described on amazon, beware. The cover was scratched, one paragraph was highlighted and there were pages folded, it was clearly a used copy and not even close to being new. Here is what the item description said before I purchased this item. Brand new, unread copy. The descriptions need to match the items that are shipped out, very disappointed..."
5,Set a perfect fit!,"I wanted to depart from toxic non-stick ware, wanted high quality, high performance, without a lot of weight, and got it all. I got it for everyday use, but this will be an essential in our Airstream! My only regret is that just after I purchased it, it was offered on another site for half the price! Still, it is definitely worth what I paid for it, and I can whole-heartedly recommend it."
3,Stowables Stick,"Good idea as far as stowing. However, as with all stainless, they do have a sticking issue. Was a bit disappointed - but I give high marks to the workmanship."
4,Great Value!,"I love that the pans fit together to fit snuggly under my cabinets. The removable handles, while easy to take on and off, can be a pain sometimes. They are NOT non-stick, which took some getting used to as well. Overall...great for what I use them for!"
4,High quality stowable set of cookware,Bought this for my sailboat. was impressed with the weight of the Stainless cookware. it Nests nicely together the handles are heavy duty and it has a nice canvas carry bag which I'll probably never use but made it well thought out.
4,cook like a chef,"I think this prodcut is of good quality and it's a bargain price when compared to it's peer brands like Calphalon. The finish is nice and cooking in this stainless steel cookware makes you feel like a pro ""chef"" .One thing I would have liked them to include in the set is a skillet instead of 3 saute pans. That might be the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Impressive new sound for traditional 70's music lovers,"This is an offering from a new group with something you don't hear very often any more--a traditional rock music sound. Any traditional rock music lovers can be grateful that there are new groups that not only recognize the power and grace of the 60s and 70s, but decades later are taking the sound to new heights. That's the great thing about Radio Moscow--anybody who likes the psychedelic sound of the 60's and 70's will appreciate it--I can especially hear the relationship to the music of Cream. Yet this is distinctively an orignal group, no cover songs, no copies, just music that was strongly influenced by an earlier era. Whether you like true 60's and 70's rock or you are looking for something current with a different sound, you won't be disappointed by this offering from Radio Moscow!"
2,How About A Best Of SNL By Year?,"How about making 'Best Of' Saturday Night Live by year? Not by host, not something with interviews and commentary, just best skits only and by year. Best of 1978, Best Of 1986, Best Of 1994, etc..."
1,How to Make a Great Show Dull & Not Very Funny,"The NBC Universal Store is having a web special - five items for $20.So I ordered this for $4 and it is considerably overpriced. I wish I'd read the Amazon reviews first!The essence of television is telling the story through pictures - ""vision."" The best way to show that the first five years of SNL would be to compile the best skits and sketches.Instead, we have some cast members, writers, and Lorne M. (again, and again, and again - but he appears to have written and produced this, so no surprise there - and again) telling us what a great, wonderful, world-changing (no kidding!) show SNL was.Apparently these good people never watched the Smothers Brothers, but that's another topic for another day.Give this one a miss! It's terrible, self-indulgent, and worthless!"
1,Not what you were expecting...,"Don't be mislead by the title into thinking you were getting a ""best of"" skits. Its a documentary on the show. How it was put together, cast interactions and affairs. Not really relevant to the comedy. That's why the used price is dropping like a rock. Other people are disappointed - as I was, and getting rid of this turkey while they can still recover some of what they paid for it."
1,Nothing Less Than Full Episodes Of The First Five Years...,"of this extremely historic comedy show will do. It was in those first years that SNL made it's reputation and made comedy and even some musical history.Why the hell Michaels, NBC, or whomever else has the rights to those years doesn't put out those full episodes is beyond me.In fact, it's a full-on travesty!I beg of whomever to please, PLEASE, release the full episodes of the first five years.Please."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to a trip down memory lane with all the best skits from the first 5 years of SNL. Instead, with this DVD, I got lots of commentary and background information, with only a few skits. The skits shown weren't even available in their entirety, which was frustrating. So, I ended up feeling that this DVD was not worth the money, did not at all provide me with what I thought I was getting based on its title."
2,A Total Puff Piece - Save Your Money,"Unfortunately, there is no real substance to this documentary. Though a few of the interviews are interesting, all are cursory at best. You're not seeing full skits and there is no criticism to speak of. I give SNL The First 5 Years 2 stars, as it's ideal for a foreign exchange film student who never heard of or saw Saturday Night Live. Save your money and watch the gazillion re-reruns."
1,THE TITLE IS MISLEADING!,"The title makes people believe that they are getting the complete first 5 years of saturday night live whe in fact it's just a clip show about the original cast (with a couple changes to the cast in those years), and how the audiences and media saw the show."
2,Kinda feel misled a bit,"This DVD is a documentary special about the cast and crew from those years, and while it is interesting, it is still the same thing you already got if you read ""Live From New York."" All in all it is okay but I was expecting a standard SNL DVD full of the old skits. That's what I plunked my $ down for. Not for this. So if you're looking to buy this for sketches, beware. On a lighter note, the Best of Aykroyd is perfection."
2,SNL - First 5 Years,"It sounds as if you're getting a ""Best of..."" deal with all the skits you'd expect to see. However, this DVD is mostly documentary with only small skit portions thrown in. Buy it if you're into history, not comedy..."
3,"Good product, needs better directions","So I assembled it, stripping screws along the way... only to find that I had left a part out. A thin metal strip serves to fill the gap opposite the hinges... It never made it into the assembly. Additionally, the latch holding the door closed was terrible. A little modification, and we were good to go."
5,Colchoneta inflable 2,"Bien cómoda, buena relacion precio valor, vale la pena, suficientemente resistente a los pinchazos por lo que se puede usar en la playa"
2,This guy needs to learn how to outline,"What a mess this book is! This isn't a ""History of Hollywood"" but rather Thomson's formless ramblings on the subject. He's witty enough, clearly a hit at parties. But someone needs to teach Thomson how to write history. I found this book incredibly frustrating and finally abandoned it in anger."
2,Hollywood Ramblings,"THE WHOLE EQUATION reads more like separate observations than anything that coheres. David Thomson, so good in his WHO's WHO, seems to be in his own little world in a book that I desperately wanted to like, but found nearly impossible to read. The best parts are about CHINATOWN, Howard Hawks, and his trashing of TITANIC and EASY RIDERS. But, having read his other material, that's old news. The addition of sound in the 30s brought pictures forward, but moving away from black and white robbed them of something--again, old news from Thomson. In the end, I had to put it down because it was going nowhere."
2,Navel Gazing,"I had such expectations upon ordering this. Usually, I make pretty good selections to read from the various book review sources I use. In this case, I was duped.This book epitomizes high brow pretentiousness, i.e. 372 pages of pure psycho-babble. Too many pages are devoted to his obsession with the movie Chinatown, and his idol worship of Nicole Kidman. He can barely write a paragraph on cinema history without derailing into the meaning of life or some such.Somehow, I can see Mr. Thomson completing a page a day and having his wife read them back to him as he stared into a mirror...This is one that I plowed through thinking it could improve and I'd miss the salient points if I put it down early. The only thing I lost were hours I'll never regain."
2,Hard Pressed to call it history.,"A book in which the author expresses his enjoyment of Jerry Lewis is not a history. What on earth do his personal likes and dislikes have to do with anything? This book is written with an almost flippant, name-dropping tone that detracts from the subject matter. After all, he is talking about Hollywood, not a subject which lacks in flashy self-promotion. I came away from it less than impressed."
3,Schizophrenic,"Part of this book--the good part--is a fascinating history and analysis of power and money in Hollywood. Thomson figures that control is power, and he's right--most of the time.Part of this book--the bad part--is twee autobiography (I'm not fastastically interested in The Granada, Tooting); endless and often obscure rhetorical questions; and rather a lot of thinking with a part of his body that is not his brain. Yes, folks, we're deep in Pauline Kael Land! Thus we get dumb tributes to dumber Nicole Kidman and her dumbest Oscar vehicle ""The Hours""; rather more about Selznick Freres than we care to know; and a rather pathetic swallowing of Slim Hawkes' ""I-Am-Muse"" myth. This self-indulgence is unfortunate, because it gets in the way of the good things in the book. Thomson's opinionated, which makes him entertaining. Thomson's opinions, though, are sometimes dead wrong. (David dear, the French are not right about Jerry Lewis. Just sayin'.)"
3,Annoyed about the switch,"This is a good hairdryer but there is one gotcha and I think the manufacturer knows about it.The switch to control the volume of air and the amount of heat is too tiny. It has all the settings really close to each other. When you say go to switch it off, you slide past STOP and end up with a blast of air instead.If you look at the picture on the box, the hairdryer is a little smaller than in real life and yet the switch is BIGGER than in real life. So I think someone is deceiving us."
4,"A spirited, lovely collection of songs","I bought this as an LP in the late 70s and was enthralled by Cook's rendition of Janis Ian's ""Stars."" The rest of the record is top notch, but this cut is worth the price of the album."
4,Amazone by Hermes,"Feminine and light. Immediate impression is autumnal with the essence of forest fruits, fern and moss. Not your run-of-the-mill fragrance - understated and unique. Classy - not brassy!"
5,I loved this book!,"Sovereign's Hold is a fantastic adventure! Following the lives of this unique cast of characters I found myself on a journey through incredibly cerebral heights and horrifyingly harsh depths as each of their individual quests intertwined. Incredibly rich in texture and imagination this book is a thrilling blend of adventure, action, political intrigue and romance woven together in a story that captivates the spirit as well as the mind.And hats off to Arwen Dayton for creating strong *and* sexy female characters whose powers of seduction are only surpassed by their skills in combat - think Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien"" or Demi Moore in ""G.I. Jane"" - yeah! ; )"
4,Great,Very good love the book prefect addition to the it girl books!! Nonstop reading u will get sucked in to it.
4,Jenny Strikes Again!,"Now that Jenny Humphrey is past the DC hearing, she's finally settled into life at her elite boarding school, Waverly. She's definitely not the 'Old Jenny' she was in Constance Billiard anymore. She's determined to be envious, to be beautiful, and to hold the top-spot of The It Girl. But Tinsley is back in action, and Jenny's kicked down to comfort in a cot instead of Tinsley's old bed. Now Callie is blood-thirsty and vengeful since her super cute shaggy haired boyfriend is ignoring her and flirting it up with Jenny. In this novel it's diving deeper to find out who the true It Girl will be. Tinsley, Callie, Jenny, or Brett? Because everyone knows that only one girl can be The It Girl."
1,wow,I started this book and was amazed at how the author could just put the f word anywhere like it was nothing! It had very strange and akward senerios like a girl making out with a teacher. I didn't finish the book but from what i read it was bad.
5,exelent,I think this was an amazing book and it was very good quality. I think the book was very good and i got it very easily through my iPad.
4,The most amazing book ever!,"The IT Girl by Cecily von Ziegesar, is a inspiring book.This book is totally amazing! i started to read it one day, and by the next day I finished it. I never get so into reading, EVER! This book made me feel like i was right next to the people in the book. I could relate to just about every problem in it. It is an awesome book for any teenage girl. I would incourage all my friends to read this book many times. It incouraged me to go out and help more than I already do now. I absolutly love this book sooooo much! I will deffanitly read all the books in the series. Over and over again."
3,Eh...,"I'll tell you what, I don't like the It girl as much as gossip girl novels. But I've started reading them and I can't stop now."
3,Fun action comedy romance,A fun action/comedy/romance which is dragged down by on overlong coda. Salman Khan plays his well-honed earnest tough guy character again but I can't fault him for sticking with such a winning and amusing formula since he does it so well and I still enjoy it.
2,Not comedy. Not a typical Salman Khan movie,I look for comedy in Salman movies. This one is a bit more romantic. No or very poor comedy. Did not like this.
3,Delightful,A very different kind of movie for Salman - music was great. The end of the movie was sad but hopeful - I liked that !
5,Loved it!,"Bodyguard is my favorite Bollywood movie with Salman Khan in it so far. Loved the action and the music.The movies has a very interesting twist in it towards the end , when Maya, the best friend, is supposed to go tell him the truth at the train station, but then decides she wants him for herself! I totally did not see that coming.Love the song Teri Meri. It also has a lot of funny parts, like when Loveley goes to school with Divia and gets kicked out of class. The action scenes are cool, even if unrealistic, but that's what typical Bollywood movies are all about, unrealistic, flashy and ""feel-good"", I wished Hollywood would make movies like this!! Plus then there is Salman himself, what a hot guy, love his abs:)"
1,Bodyguard flop,"I bought this after watching some of the clips of the film, only to find after buying it that it is not a love story with humor, at least not if compared to other enjoyable films such as monsoon wedding, or Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Acting is pretty cheesy. Its more like a C rated movie than a B. Anyone want to buy a dvd with only 45 minutes watched? I would give this half a star if i could."
1,How to Put Your Admissions Committee to Sleep,"This book might be helpful to give you a general idea of what a cover letter or personal statement should be, but the examples given would put Richard Simmons to sleep. Do yourself a favor and take a look at ""Graduate Admissions Essays"" instead, which also has a lot of great advice about the whole grad school process.The examples are also very limited in that they also do not encompass fields such as the humanities or fine arts--only social work, education, law, medicine, and a few for college and military school. I wish I could say something better about this book, but for me it was a total disappointment. None of the essays would make anyone stand up and take notice from the first line, and most start with the boring ""With the enclosed information"" or ""College is important to me because..."" A very disappointed 2 thumbs down!"
2,Not the original recordings!,"Remakes, some arguably close to the originals, and bad live versions of the originals. Beware!!!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!,"This was the most disappointing album I've ever purchased. When I say this at Best Buy for 5.99, I couldn't believe the deal I was getting. All of these great songs from the 70's that I grew up with, all on one CD. But then when I listened to the album I felt ripped off. Sure, some of the songs sound similar to the original recordings, but that's not good enough. When you've heard the songs 100's of times on the radio you are expecting to hear the songs that way, and anything else sounds like a cheap imitation. The cover did say ""new stereo recordings by the original artists"", so I did think there might be some small differences, but not to the magnitude that I discovered upon listenting.I agree with the other reviewers (and wished I would have checked here first). There's something fishy about this album. And I'd probably beware of any in this series (Best Buy had a whole modular section filled with various ""20 best of..."" albums.Arggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not Good,"Rock and roll, in my opinion, is the best music genre. There's nothing quite like it. And, Madacy released this compilation to honor the best rock and roll decade: the 1970s.Yes, there are some great artists here. Among them are Jefferson Starship, Carlos Santana, Chicago, and Rare Earth. And, it looks like a great collection of songs, and the price is especially convincing.Wrong. These are NOT the originals. As previous reviewers stated, most of these are inferior live versions and re-recorded versions. I do like the live version of Chicago's classic '25 or 6 to 4,' but other than that, this disc is very disappointing.My advice is buy the originals. They are so much better than these re-recorded versions.And, the sound quality is nothing exciting.Not recommended."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"These are NOT the original artists and I'm sorry I purchased this. No wonder it says by ""various artists"". As long as you know that the artists aren't the original you won't be disappointed."
2,a couple of good ones.,"when i picked this up at a thrift store,i missed seeing ""new stereo recordings by the original artists""if i had seen that,i would of left it behind.that said,a tune or two here are better versions than the originals.Rare earth's ""get ready"" sounds like a completely different song,same singer,just a bit more rocking than the original.Starship's Jane sounds like the original.other songs sound muddy,i would recommend this only for the cooler version of Get Ready by Rare Earth."
4,Sartre is fairly repulsive (I'm more of a Gabriel Marcel....,"man myself)and it's difficult to stomach an ""even-handed"" (i.e., non-judgemental) account of his behavior during and after WWII, but, solely from the perspective of this work being a window into the relationship of, arguably, the two foremost French thinkers of the twentith century (and please don't throw-up Foucault, Derrida and crew against C & S) - it has considerable value and is worth the read."
4,The review right above this one ...,"is way off the mark. There's more to say about this book, but for now, let me just say that the guy above doesn't have any idea what he's talking about."
2,Replacement front floor mats for my 2005 FORD Excursion,"For the price they are ok. They seem not to fit well and are too short but, if you want to get off cheap they work fine."
3,great thought,"In this case, Tolstoy doesn't know when to shut up. He made his point half-way through the book."
4,What I Believe synopsis,"Tolstoy wrote the book ""What I Believe"" and it was banned for years, very difficult to find even today, but Amazon has it. This book is about that banned book. This is a good read, but I preferred the real deal, if you can only read one, read What I Believe by Tolstoy."
3,Intellectual Christianity,"This is the textbook for 'Christian Anarchy' but I prefer the Jacques Ellul books. Tolstoy focuses on Christ as a teacher and anti-war figure, much as Martin Luther King was for our day. He rejects all mystical value: the resurrection, miracles, the virgin birth, etc. It is basically a treatise on pacifism as taught by Christ. In the example he gives of an average day in the life of an orthodox Russian Christian, filled with absurd rituals to fend off fear, one can see why he rejected the mysticism. If you are seeking a book on pacifism it's great. If you seek a deeper relationship with God that explores the concept of grace and redemption through Christ you will not find it here."
1,The Kingdom of God is Within You,"Tolstoy lived in an era when words were used to show pictures, and being succint was unheard of. Though I have enjoyed other of Tolstoy's writings, this one is an extremely laborious read! I am not sure where Ghandi got his inspiration from it. Good luck!"
1,Tolstoy schmolstoy,It's sad that things of this nature can be seriously taken for a briliant life's philosophy.
4,Relevant Even Now!,"Christian and non-christian alike, will find this a provocative and contemporary read. Written before Russia's Revolution, Tolstoy smacks us between the eye's a 100 yrs later. While this was one of Gandhi's favorite books, it is required reading for 'believer's'....who are not faint of heart and willing to be challenged. Fundamentalist will be inspired to think furiously and reconsider their so-called Biblical point of view. Like many authors of the Tolstoy era, much of their writing is a bit compulsive and redundant. Consider the repetitious phraseology a matter of emphasis, and observe that Christendom has failed to advance the Sermon On The Mount since Tolstoy and Gandhi originally petitioned us to pay attention to Jesus's simple declarations."
3,Recommended by MK Gandhi,"My interest in this volume stemmed from Gandhi's recommendation of this work by Tolstoy. In his book subtitiled ""The Story of My Experiments with Truth"" Gandhi states that he had been inspired to reread the volume and to work diligently to spread Tolstoy's message of ""non-resistance to evil by force"", a concept embodied in Gandhi's Satyagraha campaigns in South Africa and India.I gave the book a three star rating in marked contrast to higher rankings of many reviewers. I would have lowered my rating further except the book may be of value to individuals seeking information on Gandhi's approach. The book should have been an essay of modest length, not the 350 pages of repetitious material by the great novelist. My suggestion, read the final chapter in which Tolstoy discusses power in societies based upon foundations of pervasive hypocrisy, a kernel worth considering."
3,Pretty good for free.,"Another free book on Amazon that is worth a look. Although this is not my favorite book, the price is right at free!"
3,The Kingdom of God is Within You - Tolstoy,"Very well written and informative, but very repetitive in some spots. I can see how this book would inspire someone like Ghandi to devote his life to fighting social injustice. It is also a good reminder that Jesus means what he says. Many people try to reinterpret or circumvent the Sermon on the Mount, saying things such as ""It's holding up an impossible standard."" All I can say to that is, ""Duh."" God has asked his people to do things that are impossible without Him."
2,Tolstoy,"I have read a lot of Tolstoy's writings, but this one was hard to get through. It was as interesting to me as reading a repair manual. But, that's just my opinion."
2,poor biography of a great driver,"This is the book for you if you are interested in an academic review of several pre-WW2 races featuring Nuvolari. If you want to learn anything about Nuvolari the man, you'll have to look elsewhere."
3,More a textbook than a history,"Full marks to the author for attempting to capture the history of the very brave souls who formed the SOE and who performed so heroically over the course of the war. I am sure that the facts are straight and as complete as possible, but I guess I was hoping for more detail on the critical missions and stories about what they actually did and the challenges they faced. There are elements of some, but for the most part the book reads like a detailed textbook.A worthwhile read for sure, but a bit of a slog at times, definitely not a light read."
5,SOE in France by M.D.R. Foot,"I am delighted with this book, not only with its contents but with the seller. I am in Florida and the book arrived well ahead of advertised number of days in excellent condition. Thank you 5 stars."
5,Infinite Insights into Kenpo Vol.1 by Ed Parker,"An excellent book for all those interested in American Kenpo. I found it to be a great aid in explaining the many facets of this art to me-a non-practitioner. Well written and informative, it keeps you coming back for more. A must read for Kenpo enthusiasts."
3,"a solution to this pricey, short-length series","many of the complaints regarding mr. belew's new work is the 30+ minute length of the discs. at $18.98 a pop that's a fair statement. so, create an account at yourmusic.com where you can get all 3 in the series for $5.99 each and that includes shipping folks! now, onto adrian. as an artist, he is of the highest order...exploratory, searching, adventurous, experimental, shifting. if you don't as an artist, you become stagnant. yet, in all truth, i can't wait for the next king crimson, whatever and whenever it may be. that's where he really shines."
4,A history tour of material innovations and inventors,"Fenichell is highly readable. He has appreciation for inventors who have developed new materials for the service of society. His book offers a balanced perspective, with engaging anecdotes.A mild criticism concerns organization. The book is a sequence of anecdotes about different plastics. Why one is mentioned before another is not clearly explained. As a result, the book feels like journalistic stream of conscious in appreciating materials, their purposes and inventors. This is respectful of the subject, but it is a bit hard to put into overall context and see a big picture."
3,A very useful starting point,"This book is an engaging, easy to read modern history of plastic, roughly following the materials and their associated inventors, promoters, uses and abuses and aesthetics from the 1800s to the 1990s. There is a lot of philosophizing on the part of the narrator, but more than enough actual scientific and cultural history to make up for it. There are some black and white photos scattered throughout, and a complete index, but no bibliography, no notes or appendices or timeline of any kind. The book is laid out in chronological order, but dates and places are often only loosely given and skipped around, and no attempt is made to systematically explain the relations between the different kinds of plastic, let alone give chemical formulas or accurate production and manufacturing information. Contrast this with another more concretely informative work in a similar vein... say, ""Twinkie, Deconstructed""."
1,Anti-Semitic Propaganda Film,"Don't be fooled by this coy masquerade. This is NOT an objective documentary. It is anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and Holocaust-denying propaganda."
2,"After ""A Fan's Notes,"" a real disappointment","This is definitely the weakest entry in Exley's autobiographical trilogy. He finds new targets for his obsessions (the accomplished author Edmund Wilson, primarily), and by trying to make art of his life, he makes a disjointed mess of a novel instead. ""Last Notes From Home,"" the final volume, demonstrates he could pull out of his personal tailspin; there are some genuinely funny moments, and that final book is much more focused. Reading this is like looking through the wrong end of a telescope -- Exley misses the big picture as his universe becomes smaller and smaller."
4,She doesn't drag me anymore!,"this has really helped on walks with my hyper dog- I no longer have to lynch her or yank on the leash when she gets overexcited- it doesn't pinch unless she misbehaves, so it's perfect for training."
5,Amazing,"I have 30 pound cocker spaniel mix. A very ambitious and energetic dog. I take him on lots of walks and runs and it always takes about a half mile for him to calm down and walk/run beside me but even still would try to dart towards other dogs or squirrels or try and pee on a tree that got in his range. I bought this and received it today (very fast shipping too for standard) Very easy to use, and it was a complete 180 walking with him. A couple tugs on the lead and he instantly heeled up, from the first steps out the door to the last one in the door he was by my side, and I look forward to many more walks with him."
5,In Search of That Special CD,"We had this CD a few years back, it went missing. My husband and I both really loved it. We had looked for it in several stores. For several years when we traveled to other States or Countries we searched for it, no luck. Recently someone suggested we try Amazon.com, they can get you almost anything you want. So that very night, I found it. My husband was so excited about finding it, he wanted it to come as quick as we could get it.We now drive around listening and singing along with it. We are very happy to have been able to find it."
5,One of Jessica Hart's best - funny and believable,"Skye Henderson is a good-natured, loopy, fun-loving girl with a mad crush on a not-particularly-interested executive who's (uh-oh) relocating from London to Edinburgh. What to do? Overly optimistic Skye decides the only logical plan is to follow him to Scotland under the pretext of having gotten a job there herself. Now, the only problem is convincing serious Scotsman Lorimer Kingan, no-nonsense golf course architect, that she's the perfect temporary secretary. With her vast secretarial skills (none), knowledge of golf (none), sensible office attire (none), how can Lorimer say no? The odd and amusing path to true love will keep you very entertained as Skye finally learns who is the right kind of man for her."
5,This novel made my Christmas during 1997,"I don't usually keep books. But this is part of my cherished collection that I bring out when I need my mood lifted.Further, this book always puts me in a Christmas spirit. It has an original sense of Xmas magic. The theme, the poems, the prose, the dreams, the depth of emotion, the story, it all builds into layered, rich, satisfying Xmas experience. Much more so than so many sentimental, or kind of boring Xmas novels.Yes, it has poems. But, it's not typical literary fiction, which usually bores me. The story grabs me, and is 100% believable. I go through the tunnel of darkness with the character. Somehow, its light of day moments moments are true magic.It avoids predictability. I love the non-mainstream characters, which could appeal to other fantasy fans.To me, this is Richard Grant's best book. Nothing else comes close. But, it is a little dated (Nineties)."
4,in praise of 'land of winter',"richard grant does a very nice job on this one...I really enjoyed cruising through it- a great short (3 or 4 hour)read-no really obscure verbage but high on descriptive prowress. Grant gets in a couple of rants and raves about christians and other marvels. especially well written when you dig on the ""in touch"" femininity poured out by young richard. the plot centers around the removal of an admitted witch's daughter by ""the authorities""--it shows pippa drawing courage and inpiration from her wicca/witchy sense of spirituality."
2,"""In the Land of Winter"" left me cold","I must agree with Ms. Jordan. I so wanted to love this book, and I kept hoping that it would improve as I read. It never really did. It was difficult to sympathize with Pippa--the journey to reclaim her child seemed secondary to her own quest to discover herself. And I'm still not sure what exactly she discovered. Pippa's passivity made me continually want to scream, ""Ye gods, girl, don't just stand there, DO SOMETHING!"" None of the characters seemed very well fleshed out, the plot meandered to a most unlikely ending, and when it was all over, I thought, ""what a great story poorly done."" A disappointment."
3,Reminded me of Heinlein...,"...In that the book went along great for a while. Made sense, moving pace, interesting characters, but then it delved into something akin to a hallucinogenic cartoon paradise and ceased to make sense.I still don't understand why Pippa's solution to her daughter being taken away was to run off to a cabin in the woods and ""find her inner witch."" Then she donned some ratty clothing given to her by a sympathizer and, dressed as an old crone, paraded her way into town, scaring the townsfolk in the process.I was hoping for a saner book. Before that point of Wizard of Oz-esque fantasy, it was a very good book. Richard Grant is a very good writer and has a lot to offer. I'm interested in his other books, but In the Land of Winter left me a bit dubious.I hope he writes more, but leaves the Heinleinish acid trips out of it."
3,A good start or refresher,"This book is a simple look at the ground forces of the Third Reich. It cover each branch of the armed service(Infantry, SS, Panzer, Artillery,etc) the training and role in WWII. I must admit that I skipped through most of the ""historical"" chapters, they offered very little insight and seemed quite basic. While this book is great (5 Stars) for the casual reader, it is less of a key tome for the serious WWII historian."
2,"A good primer, but not for the serious student.","This book lightly covers all the theaters of war. The Chapters include: Moulding the Soldier; Infantry; Panzer Forces; Artillery; Airborne and Special Forces; The Waffen-SS; Casualties of War; France 1940; North Africa 1941-43; The Eastern Front 1941-43; Defeat in the East 1943-5; The Italian Campaign 1943-45; Normandy 1944; North-West Europe 1944-45.It is not for the serious student that already has an overview of the Wehrmacht and wants details. That is why I got the book.Example: It talks about how well the Waffen-SS did in actual combat and about their stringent training requirements. It does not mention that the Waffen-SS Division had more tanks, equipment, and men than the Wehrmacht Division.It had a lot of personal stories in it."
3,eh,"me no likey, not very good on spyder edge though it was recommended special for spyder edge. me no likey, not very good on spyder edge though it was recommended special for spyder edge"
1,C'est tres horrible,This book makes a feeble attempt to show the world that an airplane hit the pentagon. They clearly have removed the parts of the pictures that show the evidence that debunks theur theory. Thats all I will say.
2,Disppointed,When I read the review for the book I got the idea it was along the lines of a tutorial. When I received the book I was very disappointed. The data wasn't any different than that I've on other photography books going back to the old Kodak Take Better Pictures series. The real disappointment was that the photos in the book did not related to the text. What I wanted was text and instructions with photos that illustrate the instruction.
4,My PERFECT Guy?,"Jessica and Damon are finally going out but there's a total issue of miscommunication here! Neither is sure what the other one wants and they end up making each other and themselves unhappy by not talking at all! If only they had acted like they were actually friends...I've been in a situation like this before and I just have one thing to say...make sure you TALK! Why else have a boyfriend? But anyway this book can tell you just WHY you need to talk. I rated it 4 stars because I liked it and it seemed kind of like something was missing, however. A must-read!"
2,Um............,"I love sweet valley and read all of they're books, and enjoy all of them. Like you can read them more than once! But this book was kinda boring. I think if it were more reqlistic it would have been better. This wouldn't have happened in real life. SO if you cant pick between this book and another, pick the other cause this was a flunk."
3,A Bit Off,"One correction and one observation.The description of the corrida sequence was just plain wrong. Los toros do not enter the ring through the toril with the banderias already in place. That occurs after the Picadors have their action.Also, it is a bit ironic that no where in the book do you find any of the pre-works and other photos with the exception of the cover and opening page. With all the references to people, places and things one would expect at least some illustrations. Apparently done on a tight budget.Padre Thyglow"
1,This Book Is Not Good,"I regret having to give this even one star. The author has thrown up a bolshevik screed that is ignorant of history. His knowledge of the Spanish Civil War seems to be entirely the product of communist propaganda; he even repeats hackneyed lies that Moscow gave up on decades ago! Even worse than the author's political bias and historical shortcomings is his terrible grammar. The author should have written a simple art review for a European, socialist-type magazine and called it quits. HOW did this over-expanded piece ever get published as a book?"
3,Has this author never heard of a split infinitive?,"I'm midway through 'Picasso's War' and so far I'm really enjoying its content. It's a well-rounded account not only of Picasso's famous artwork, but of the history and social context and Picasso's life and personal situation at the time. However, I have one huge criticism, which is that this book is full of grammatical errors - namely split infinitives on just about every page. I don't expect every author who has something interesting to say to have a perfect grasp of grammar, but surely that's what an editor is for? The lack of good editing in this text has quite spoiled the experience of reading it for me. I read very widely and I can honestly say that I've never read such a poorly edited book in all my life. Pocket Books, Simon & Schuster or whoever you are, you've done a very poor job."
1,wrong merchandise,"I cannot give you a review because the order was misunderstood and I got my money back. The sender did not understand was the software was all about and I got just one disk instead of the complete four. If there would be a NEW set available, I would probably buy it, but there was none offered."
2,Something's wrong,"I am very disappointed in this camera. It has very slow reaction time when I turn it on--sometimes I have to bang it against my hand to wake it up. The software doesn't work with my PC--I haven't been able to use this camera.Follow up from my original review. Samsung replaced the original camera, but it took close to six months and many messages and emails to their customer service department, which never called me back. I have not had the same kind of problem with the second camera. I solved the download problem by purchasing a USB card reader that I can plug in anywhere to look at pictures--I don't need any software. It is very sensitive to movement and half my pictures are blurry--use a tripod when you can--it's the only way to go. I'd like a camera with a normal viewer so I don't have to use the screen--my old Olympus did this and I never had shaky pictures. My rechargeable batteries seem to do a pretty good job--I can take pictures all day on one set of batteries usually."
2,Shaky at best,"I am a little disappointed with this camera. It seems to drain the batteries even when camera is not in use! I took it on my last vacation and it does take great pitures but it takes a lot of blurry pics too depending on the settings. The movie mode seems to work nice. You have to really watch your settings and adjust it constantly to according to your lighting conditions, etc... It seems to be very slow to take pics with the double flash. The cameral doesnt always turn on, I have to turn it on and off a few times even with good batteries for the power to turn on. Really annoying! The zoom I love but with all the great potential pic moments I lost because of because the recover time from taking pic after pic, ruined pics because a lot came out blurry I would recommend something else."
1,Junk,"This is one of the worst electronics purchases I have ever made. Frankly, when it did work, it did not work correctly. I got virtually use out of it before it died. I must say I am glad that it died early, because I can get reimbursed for this piece of junk by the Mastercard extended warranty program."
3,Great camera - when it works,"Camera worked great right after we bought it in June 2006. By January 2007, it was slow to open, and I'd have to bang it with my hand or tilt it a certain way to get it to open and turn on. I'm going to see about the warranty to get it fixed.Oh, it does eat batteries. But we started using rechargeables shortly after purchase, and it takes a lot longer for the camera to eat those... I can get triple the pics off rechargeable batteries.I have no issues with downloading photos.That is, when it works.Edited to add: The camera is pretty much dead now. Granted, I gave it a hell of a workout when I first got it (5200 pictures in the first month), but I haven't used it more than might be typical usage since. It won't even turn on anymore, and I have pictures I need to offload."
3,i like it,"this is a very respectable camera in my opinion. though mine dont work anymore because i droppped it. well it works but the lcd is kinda on and off depending on which way you turn it. but when it hadnt broken, i was prefectly satisfied with the camera. huge lcd screen, get good batteries. respectable quality video, get a 1 GB or 2GB card to take advantage of it."
4,better,i thought this book was good although i enjoyed the 1st better.. i hope they come out with a third!
3,Wrong wheel,Good wheelbarrow one big problem..The one I bot has a wheel that flops back a forth on the axil.I believe it's just the wrong wheel for this model.I'll be taking it back
5,very informative,"All this time, my friends and colleagues have told me that Bill Clinton was ""the most pro-Israel President of all time."" They could not have been more WRONG! Reading David Crystal's book has been eye-openning and has underscored how we have allowed people to so easily revise history to suite their personal and political agendas. I commend Mr. Crystal for having the courage and intellectual rigor to find the truth and report on it."
5,Great Accessory!,I've been wanting this griddle for a while. I purchased the Coleman Grill Stove a few years ago and have been wanting this accessory ever since. I love the variety of camp meals that I can make by switching between the grill and the griddle. Looking forward to enjoying this on many camping trips to come.
2,Did not fit,I needed to return this item as it did not fit the stove I purchased. Please be carefull of the sizing as it will not work with all Colman stoves
4,Awesome add-on...,"Great accessory for my camp stove. Now I can grill burgers/brats for dinner, and fry up eggs & bacon in the morning on the griddle...The versatility of the stove cannot be matched...only better if both were MADE IN USA."
5,easy to cook and clean,"Bought this for camping trip couple weeks ago. Used it every morning for turkey-bacon, eggs, pancakes, etc...easier than cooking at home on the stove! Piece of cake to clean. Wish it fit in the stove when want to close it up and/or had some sort of protective cover. Still, it is a great value and increases the fun/enjoyment of morning camping...don't leave home without it!"
