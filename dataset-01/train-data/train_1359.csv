4,Nine Stories to Live,"This book of short stories is very different from J.D. Salinger's previous works, it touches on human emotion and passion. While the stories are beautiful written and well thought it is the last story ""Teddy"" that catches the greatest human sentiment and feeling of all."
5,All steel...,"Pricey, but the quality is very good. It's all stainless steel even the springs and gears. I mainly use this for melon balls for my fruit salads or making Devil's Egg snacks."
1,To scoop or not,"The best part of this scoop is that it is stainless steel so it looks good in the odds and ends drawer. It uses a rack and gear system to move the ejector ban; Functionally, it does work because the rack consistenly jumps the gear on any item denser than water, thus leaving the band outside of the scoop and the cookie dough or ice cream remaining inside. Simply put it is a tool looking for a better design."
5,Versatile & High Quality,"I ordered this with plans to use it when baking cookies. It has exceeded my expectations. Prior to owning this, I had a Wilton brand plastic one that just flat out sucked. Cookie dough was too much for it, but this stainless steel one is so strong and perfect for not only cookies, but balling melons, scooping gelato/ice cream and nearly anything else you would like to make into a ball."
1,Spring mechanism broke during first use,"Items appears to be of good quality but, just after one use... it is useless. The spring mechanism that that releases the contents of the scoop has broken and will no longer work. I purchased it two months ago and had not had a chance to use it until now and now it is past the 30 day return policy so, now I am out the purchase price."
2,Norpro scoop not quite up to par,I am disappointed in the quality of this Norpro scoop. I have a Stocke size 60 scoop and wanted a size 70. The Norpro scoop is the right size but leaves batter in the scoop because the mechanism does not work efficiently. I would not recommend this scoop.As always the service from Amazon is outstanding. This particular product is just not as good as I had hoped.
4,$9.59 for the perfect size,My melon baller is rusted after 20 years of service and it is terrific that this can double as a cookie dough portioner.
2,Not correct measurement,This is not a one tablespoon measure.It is at the very least a two tablespoonscoop.If you expect accuracy this scoop will not work well for you.
4,Handy!,This makes quicker work of cookie making. I did break it using it to scoop caramel for truffles though. So I wish it was a little sturdier. But it is very handy for cookie dough and cleans easily.
1,disappointed,This item broke the first time we used it. The gear would slip and you could put it back on track but after 10 or 15 times we just gave up and threw it away.
3,Time will tell,I ordered this product as a Pampered Chef item and only to find out it has nothing to do with Pampered Chef nor does it has the name Pampered Chef inside the handle as the one I have. Time will tell if I even like it or not but sure is pricey for a plan scoop.
5,Good scooper,"I purchased this scooper a few months ago and have used it several times since then. I find it very handy for cookie dough, filling muffin pans, and even scraping out soft fruits and vegetables. We don't have a dishwasher, so it's a bit difficult to hand wash all the cracks, but other than that I've found it to be a great addition to my kitchen."
4,fairly good,"Buy this product in order to evenly spread the batter into the muffin pan. I found it very good, except that at times gets stuck."
3,Good size not so good quality.,I love the size and it makes perfect cookies but it is not very tough. My slide bent then popped out after just a few uses. The cookie dough was cold when I bent it and it popped out when I tried to use it on ice cream but is that not what it is for? It still works alright but I'd rather not pay 12.00 for an item that gets damaged so easily.
4,"Great, except for lousy recoil","This would be a great reel if the recoil worked better. After all, isn't that the purpose of buying a reel ... so it will recoil itself? Also, they should include a swivel base mount.Quality product though and it gets a rating of 4 biners from me."
2,Damaged in shipping,"The hose reel appears to be well built, but it was very poorly packaged, and suffered damage during shipping. I didn't notice the damage when I first opened the carton - one area of the metal hose rim was bent (but the paint wasn't scratched or marred). Unfortunately, I discarded the shipping carton before I realized the item was damaged; so I can't return it to Amazon for an exchange or refund. It is a very heavy item, and the shipping carton is clearly inadequate to protect it during shipping. Reelcraft has been making hose reels for some time, so you would think they would know how to package them properly to avoid damage. Due to the significant weight of the item, and the very poor attempt at packaging it, I would be surprised if any of these hose reels would be received without some sort of damage. Buyer beware."
5,Classic CD,"Honeymoon Suite is a great band. I listen back to some of my old cassettes and CD's now and wonder why I was interested in some bands, but HS still excites me like it did years ago. The best song on the disc, What Does It Take?, will always be the ultimate power, love ballad. I will be buying their other CD's to complete the collection."
5,The absolute best CD I have ever owned!!!,I first hear this group in the mid-80's and still play it regularly. The album has excellent lyrics and is the best band people have never heard of. I heard they are coming out with a new album soon. I'm excited.A modern day group that may compare for the first time in 15+ years to me is Lifehouse.Rock on Honeymoon Suite even though there are only two (the main two) remaining original members.
1,Still searching for psychedelia in San Francisco,"I bought this recording based on a sound byte on a vw beetle commercial. This CD blows. There's nothing they do that hasn't been done better by almost anyone who's tried it. It's only redeeming quality is that it didn't cause seizures. If Amazon had had even one song available to listen to, I never would have bought this CD."
3,18 gauge brads in a 16 gauge nailer?,"I haven't tried these yet, hence the neutral score, but I suspect Derek's problems might have been due to trying to use 18 gauge nails in a 16 gauge finish nailer (FN250A). No wonder they would misfire."
1,Poor Quality Nails for the Porter-Cable Finish Nailer,"These nails are not of the quality necessary for the Porter-Cable Finish Nailer that they are typically advertised with (FN250A and others). They sometimes came out 2 at a time, not at all, or caused the nailer to jam. I called Porter-Cable, and acquired their nails, and the problems went away. I would not recommend these nails, especially for this nailer."
3,"Images, Images","I find him very difficult to understand. And I read a lot of poetry (Levertov, Collins, Kooser, Oliver, etc), but his images are wonderful. I would purchase the book justto savor his images. They are wonderful and unique."
5,Great.,There were so many books to chose from for the ASVAB. The thing that initially sold me on this one was that it was the 8th edition. It was the right choice. They have done this before. All the answers are right. All the subjects are covered.I highly recommend this book.
2,A Word of Warning...,"I have gone through nearly all of this book, and though it did serve as a good refresher course for many high school subjects that I had forgotten, this book frustrated me. I found so many errors that I ended up putting it aside all together. With so much on my plate right now, it takes a lot for me to find time to study to prepare for the ASVAB. I really do not have time to re-check the accuracy of every solution in this book. Overall, I am disappointed in this purchase, and will go elsewhere for a new ASVAB study guide."
1,horrible book,this is a terible book.first of all none of the anwser keys are corect and they have look at a diagram and you have to pick say which gear is doing what and none of them are labled. second of all the cd i got takes for ever to load on the test after the first one. the questions are a lot harder than on the test. they give you to much information to review on the subjects. for example there are no qestions on carburetors or fule pumps but they spend about four pages on them. then theres sample questions on stuff that they don't even cover in the review. i can't recomend this book unless you've been living in a cave the last thousand years. the sample test are useless and there just to much review on stuff you don't need. trying to pick out review material would just be a waste of time.
4,"A good sampling of Emmylou, but not the best.","I loved the album for the first six songs, and didn't like it so much for the last five songs. But I love the first six songs so much, that i eI efeel that the album was worth it to me, anyway."
2,A great book with one Giant glitch.,"This book is filled to the rim with what seems like wonderful and interesting spells that I can't wait to do, except, I'm sure I never will. Why? You can only get the incense and oils that are required at a shop she mentions at the end of the book, and the web site doesn't carry them. As an example: One of her Negative Energy Removing Spells requires one white candle, Jinx Removing oil, Uncrossing incense, an athame consecrated Holy water, a hematite, Lady Luck Oil, Good Luck Incense, and a red mojo. As you can see..how do you get Good luck incense??? Or Jinx removing Oil??? ETC.... The whole book and every spell is like this one. You can get some of these recipes from Cunninghams' Magical Herbalism IF you like making oils and incense from scratch. This book was such a diappointment, so many spells, but none to cast. The only thing to do is substitute what I think could go in it's place."
1,deep disapiontment,"I was looking to attain a deeper knowledge of color correspondences. By the 1st review I thought this was it! The book arrived and was written beautifuly. The problem was I forgot to order a catlogue from the author's favorite shop as well. The spells all require oils that everyone in my circle has never even heard of. The same may be said of most of the incenses. The author refers to Cunningham and Malbrough in the sources area... then comes her favorite shop.Maybe my expectaions were a bit off. If someone is looking for true color correspondence this is not it. I wanted a better grasp of the blues, and a clearer understanding of shades and blends. This was a wonderful read, and I will probably request a cataloge from the aforementioned shop. But as far as a better understanding of color.....none gained. Tina Ketch is still my color guide"
1,This is a bargain?,This is absurd! $15 for the chair and $103 for shipping? What is the matter with this company and with Amazon for running the ad?
2,Beautifully hilarious,"I figured it would be good to have a Mac review of this game, since it's one of a few adventure games that made it to the Mac platform. Simply said, even though the game is not OS X compatible, the graphics and sound are pretty wonderful. I also enjoy being able to talk to other characters in the game. That said, the puzzles are hilarious, in that they make no logical sense. Success is basically based on guesswork and luck. Sometimes it's also necessary, in order to get more ""clues,"" to talk to the same person about the same topic, even though that topic has already been discussed and is blacked out. This nonsensical aspect may prove frustrating to serious gamers, but I find it kind of fun, as I never take this stuff too seriously.Seriously, though, it's not that good a game."
1,If I could play it.....,"Growing up, this was my favorite game! I love the puzzles, graphics, music, voices, everything about it. I was thrilled to find it again.HOWEVER, this product description fails to mention that this product is ONLY compatible with Classic Mac. It will not run on OS X Tiger or later. VERY disappointed."
4,Must have for New Wavers!!!,"The best track on this cd is the hypnotic ""Send Me an Angel"" Dance Mix, and the first track which is just a shorter version. My only disappointment is that this cd does not contain the original version from 1983, which is equally as wonderful as the '89 mixes. ""Send Me an Angel"" is one of the most moving and soul soothingly wonderful songs to ride the new wave in the eighties! If you listen to Depeche Mode or Duran Duran, then Real Life comes somewhere in between! Other big hits from Real Life include ""Catch Me I'm Falling"" (I must admit, I have always found this song to be kind of annoying), and Always(good song). My personal favorites include ""Babies"", ""No Shame"", and ""One Blind Love"". I think the talent of this group wears a little thin in some of the songs I have not mentioned, but the two ""Send Me an Angel"" tracks are the centerpiece to this collection."
1,Buyer Beware - Mislabeled!,"Downloaded the song 'Catch Me I'm Falling' from this album. Instead of the hooky tune I remembered, I got a badly produced Disco mix of the song. It was impossible to tell this from the short, low quality sample offered for download check.AND, the song is labeled as if it is the original, not the screwy remix it actually is."
2,One or two good tracks...,"""Send Me An Angel"" is without a doubt the highlight of the disc. Unfortunatly, that and ""One Blind Love"" are about the only captivating tracks on the disc, with the rest coming off as more overblown pop songs with little to no sincerity behind them. I found myself skipping most of the tracks regularly."
2,calendar creator,I think this product is more complicated that it should be. But it gets the job done. It would help to have an instruction manual.
5,OLIVIA IS THE ONE THAT WE WANT,"FOR OVER 25 YEARS OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN HAS WON OUR HEARTS AND ADMIRATION. THIS ""LIVE"" CD WILL NOT ONLY BRING FOND MEMORIES TO OLD FANS, BUT WILL BRING NEW FANS WHO HAVEN'T LISTENED TO OLIVIA BEFORE. HER PERFORMANCE ON THIS CD IS ""LIVE"" NOT ENHANCED LIKE TODAY'S ENTERTAINERS WHO NEEDS VOICE ENHANCERS TO LIVEN THEIR CONCERTS. OLIVIA HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER FROM THE OPENING OF XANADU, TO THE PURENESS OF PRECIOUS LOVE, TO THE SWEET INTERPRETATION OF SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW, TO HER SIGNATURE CLOSING SONG I HONESTLY LOVE YOU. OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN HAS DELIVERED TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND THIS CD CAPTURES EVERY ESSENCE AND NUANCE OF THIS LEGENDARY ENTERTAINER."
4,A Concert worth Reliving,"Olivia in Concert is better than Olivia on CD any day, and this CD proves why. The woman is pure ""Magic"" throughout, connecting with her audience in a way that very few artists do. The astaunding thing about this artist is that she appeals across generations, from older fans whose children adored her growing up, to the youngest of kids who still think of Livvy as Sandy in ""Grease."" Her pipes are perfectly pitched STILL, and there has never been a better showcase of her pure talent than this Journey. A terrific addition to any music collection."
1,Worst Movie Ever Can't Act,"Talk about bad acting. Katie Homes should stick to Dawson's Creek like series and character. Since her movie career wasn't doing so well, she suddenly jumps up because Tom delusionally crazed scientology Cruise asks her hand in marriage. Give me a break. This is where hollywood really goes wrong. They both need psychiatric help!"
2,Not as good as Chasing Liberty,"In 2004 there were two movies that dealt with the life of the first daughter: ""Chasing Liberty"" with Mandy Moore and this one with Katie Holmes. Guess which premiered in theaters first? ""Chasing Liberty"". Guess why - because it was better, and rather than release ""First Daughter"" at the same time, the studio delayed it so that it would have a better chance at the box office. The only problem is, by the time this film came out, it looked like a copy cat of ""Chasing Liberty"". I did not go see it in theaters because it looked like a second-rate version of Mandy Moore's movie. For a cheap rental fee, I was willing to check it out, and was not impressed.Want a cute, smart film about the president's teen daughter who yearns to be normal and have fun? My recommendation is ""Chasing Liberty"""
2,Same Story Different Cast,This movie is exactly like Chasing Liberty. I didn't believe the critics at first. So I decide to see it for myself. Believe me the critics hit it dead on. I enjoyed better this movie better than Liberty. For one reason only because Amerie Rogers who played Sam Mackenzie best friend. She was funny and hilarious. Save your money and time. Because this movie is already out on DVD is called Chasing Liberty.
4,Better than Chasing Liberty,"I, like most people, would say it's a lot like Chasing Libery, but there are a few big differences. First Daughter is rated PG while Chasing Libery is PG-13. I have seen both of them, and I really liked this one. It may be for younger viewers, but it is still a great movie. I prefer First Daughter because I am picky about what I watch. Most movies day aren't for the younger girls. I'm in my twenties and I would rather go see the lower rated movie with the same basic story line because there aren't that many. And may be if we show we want more like this they will start making movies that everyone in the family can watch together."
3,Wait for Directors Cut - This version is a big let down.,I recently saw this film at the Cinema (we're a bit behind in Australia) and immediately checked out Amazon to see if I could get the DVD from the US. I thought it was such a nice film and the chemistry between Katie and Mark is just awesome. Some parts were really funny and overall it was really entertaining.I was very disappointed once the dvd arrived as half of the really funny scenes have been taken out of the dvd. I can only assume that a different version aired in theatres in Australia. I'd wait to get the Directors cut or purchase it overseas as this DVD version is no where near as good as the version I saw at the cinema.Total let down.
3,The story was quite interesting.,"The story was quite interesting. There were a few twists in the story. The story is that the ""first daughter"" goes to college at an unnamed school on the west coast (it's filmed on the beautiful UCLA Westwood campus). The first daughter wants nothing more than to have a typical, normal life. That is not exactly obtainable, however: the Secret Service agents make having a reasonable life, difficult, if not impossible. As a result, the first daughter takes affirmative steps to normalize her life, unaware that she is still within the protective cover of the secret service. The twist is that she falls in love with a secret service -- although she is unaware of it at the time. That's one of the best parts in the movie. Overall, Katie Holmes is not the best actress, and it is plausible that someone else could have played her part better.--Michael"
4,fantastic,this was a fantastic movie too watch. and i could see that katie holmes really rocks from this movie.
3,maybe,i am a katie fan and of all my time i think this her worst feature project. good for some people and the acting was great but the plot is pointless and its not as funny as it sounds. thats my opinion. (and its true)halla at ya later
4,Beautifully made,"The movie is a breath of fresh air. It brings back values like duty, honor, and respect to the forefront.Good for you Forrest Whitaker!"
5,What a joy to watch,I too totally enjoyed this film and was delighted at the morality the lead charaters chose when so often in the movies they make distructive choices. These were good people who denied themselves for the greater good. How refreshing and so needed for young people to see. Thank you for making this film. I will now be one of my favorites.
5,Fabulous!,"I LOVE this movie! It's fresh, fun, and clean with gorgeous music that all romantics will love. What a delightful movie to watch, and the kids can too! Katie Holmes is adorable as the nation's First Daughter in her first semester at college, and Marc Blucas is dashing and debonair as her fellow student/boyfriend/undercover Secret Service agent. The supporting actors are excellent, and add excellent depth to the movie. If you're looking for a clean, amusing ""chick flick"", I completely recommend it. Wish that Marc starred in more leading man roles like this!!"
3,"Nice, but...","I wanted to like this movie, but the acting was weak. MB should try more serious roles. I mean, he can't tell her that he's her BODYGUARD??? I loved them as a couple, but... Sam goes a little overboard with trying to make James jealous. She should have said that they should be friends, or something. They HAVE to make a sequel were James and Sam hook up after collage, blah blah blah. Nice movie, but a little weak."
5,Enjoyable Easy Listening,"It was wonderful to hear and understand a new artist singing true to life songs. Listening to this CD on my one hour journey to work was a welcome relief from the everyday music you hear over and over again on the radio. I hope one day Jo-Ann will be in the Tampa, Fl area so I can enjoy her music live. I would advise anyone to pickup/order a copy today."
3,Slow and predictable,"I read reviews for this film so purchased it thinking it was going to be a stimulating cycling film. It was tedious and predictable with the opening so boring if I was in a movie theatre I would have left. Further, there was too much uninteresting English dialogue. I don't understand why people want to make films so ennuyant."
4,Tech-head messenger meets cranky retro-grouch roadie!,"The title pretty much says it all!Charlotte Laurier plays a professional downhill mountain bike racer who hesitates by two seconds just before starting the biggest race of her life ... and loses by that very same two seconds. After being fired by her team, she returns to her native Montreal and gets a job as a bike messenger.Needing service one evening, she discovers a small shop owned by a cranky Italian former professional road bike racer (and now master mechanic).The two clash at first, but over time grow to understand one another. The classic scene is when the two hold a competition of sorts ... what about? You'll just have to watch the film to find out."
4,Very close to a 5 star single,"In terms of quantity, this is an excellent single to have. the tracks are1. waffle2. Black (live)3. Speak (live)4. Too close to hate (live)5. Bitch (live)Only thing preventing it from 5 stars is the radio edit of waffle and the gaps between songs, none of them flow on into one another.All the live songs are quality with the standout being black.Get this single if your a fan as it is well worth it to hear the early live tracks that may nto be often heard anymore."
5,Reliable caffeine pipeline,"Automatic delivery is great and the price is right. My commitment to the product (buying in bulk) pays off in a very satisfying way, in this case. One problem with our last order, the last of six boxes that we opened was defective (some tea bags only filled half or a third of the way). This being the last box we opened, it was way past Amazon's 30 day return policy, so I emailed Twinings with my story, mentioned the Amazon automatic purchase deal and the Lot numbers from the package, and Twinings sent me some replacements. All well in the end, but was contingent on the manufacturer standing behind their product."
5,My favorite tea,I cannot find this brand and flavor in stores. Subscription ordering insures that I always have my favorite tea on hand.
5,Consistent great flavor,Just a good consistent quality Darjeeling at a reasonable price. There are so many different Darjeeling black teas available from specialty shops as loose tea leaves. Their flavors varied. This Twinings in bags is easy and great consistent brew.
5,Twinings Darjeeling tea bags,Twinings Darjeeling tea is our favorite tea and buying the bags in large quantities is both convenient and cost efficient.
5,wynngs Darjeeling tea,"This is my favorite tea, and having a case of it delivered automatically every 6 months saves a lot of money."
2,Not much taste,I drank Twinings Darjeeling tea in Britain and loved it so I thought I was getting a good deal when I bought 300 bags at a good price from Amazon. Now I wish I'd read the other reviews. Apparently Twinings has a different blend for the US. It has very little taste at all. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's as good as anything one can find in the average US supermarket but that's not to say it's actually tasty.
2,Not for the Asians who like Dark Tea,"Well, Twinnings are one of the best brands and I was hoping go for it. But this specific one is not as dark or strong as some of the South Asian folks would like to have. Its great if you are just having it without milk. But if you want to have a strong morning tea, this is not the right kind. I think the Assam blend is probably the best but I couldnt find the one I got from U.K. The flip side of Amazon order is I cant return the rest of the unopened boxes ( it comes with 6 boxes, as you know). I tried to use two tea bags on one cup of tea but it still doesnt give me the kick.... so I have to say, as much as I wanted to like it for the price and convenience, I am going to give the rest of the boxes away to freinds and family as gifts whilst I still look for that Assam blend or strong dark liqour of black tea,,"
2,Leaks,My Rapid Reel has leaked at the swivel every since i bought it. I would like to know where I can order Orings for it.
4,All in one,This is a great collection for anyone to own.The only problem with purchasing from America is that we were hit with 16.00 Import Tax when the parcel arrived. Also on the DVD's themselves they actually say that they are not supposed to be sold outside of the USA!Something to be aware of!
2,Broken Spindle Hole,"All of the movies were great but today I decided to finally play ""Kid Galahad."" When I removed the DVD from the spindle of the DVD case one layer of the plastic around the spindle hole on the DVD broke off so that a piece of the DVD came off. Part of the DVD hole is remaining but I'm afraid to play the DVD now-pieces of plastic might come off and break my DVD player. Unfortunately I bought this box set in 2010 and I cannot return it because the return window of time is long past. So I guess that if I want to see this movie I'll have to buy a new copy separately. Not a happy customer!"
5,What a great set,This collection would be worth the price for only two of the movies - Larceny Inc and The Little Giant - where Edward Robinson plays gangster comedy. These are a typical of Robinson but well worth viewing. But then you also get a couple of other good movies of the era and a pretty good compilation about gangster movies. If you like classic movies this is a great set.
3,STARTED GREAT BUT ENDED BORING!,"This was such an interesting tale in the beginning. It was a fantasy-based story that reminded me of the movie Predator but set in the Roman era.I don't know which author started this novel, but he was by far the better writer because, by the middle half, it started to drag and bore me. I could actually feel the steam of the story run out. What a shame...Great idea that could have panned out for a much better ending."
5,"""Killer"" is a must have for any serious collector.","Take ""Alien"", ""Predator"", and a Kizinti, mix well and drop into the middle of Imperial Rome. Whether you're a fan of Karl Edward Wganer, David Drake, or just like razor edged adventure with a touch of horror, ""Killer"" will keep your attention. Well written and exciting. This is not a kiddie story."
4,A Roman 'Alien',"Great book set in the Roman Empire. Lots of action,great charactors,hidden agendas and teror! The main charactor,Lycon,is real good at his job but his life is on the line in more ways than one.The end has a nice twist to it and Drake puts spots of humor throughout to change the mood. Not a big shoot'em up book but vary enjoyable.I pull this one out about once a year and find it just as good every time I read it. Good fun."
3,Action Thriller for a Fast Read,"This is a well-written action novel, though its plot is not quite as original as some other readers may think. Like all good action stories, it avoids dragging passages--but there are no time-outs for character development. There are a couple of weaknesses in the book, however. One shortcoming is the climax, where the final confrontation ends rather quickly and ordinarily; and that is surprising, considering that the entire book up to that point hypes the speed and power of the phile.Another shortcoming concerns a rogue subplot, about how the hero's teenage son is seduced by a tutor and ""converted"" into a willing homosexual (yeah, sure)--leading to the hero's nasty revenge against the tutor. That subplot, besides being ridiculous, serves no useful purpose to the main plot and is evidently only a gratuituous expression of the authors' personal bias."
3,Docs to see before you die,"Never knew about this until I saw 50 Documentaries to See Before You Die. Tried to order it once before, but it was VERY expensive - glad I waited because for some reason the price came way down. Anyway, it was interesting, and I'm glad I saw it, but I think I was hoping for more insight into strategy & tactics. It was an inside look, but very surface-level. It's also unbelievable that it seemed so dated, and it's the 90s for God's sake. Still worth watching though. That Clinton!"
3,very good,"I don't doubt there was a lot that happened that didn't get filmed. But what you see shows how messy, off the cuff, and reaction oriented much of what was done was. To my way of thinking that elevates the intelligence of these guys. And historically, this marks a very interesting turning point. This was the model that is used by almost every effective campaign today."
4,The real West Wing,"Ok, so The War Room is really pre-West Wing. This is a great behind the scenes tale of how Clinton beat Bush. In fact, I would give it 5 stars if it was a bit longer.The leadership and strategy of James Carville coupled with the style and substance of George Stephanopolous led the Clinton campaign to the ultimate prize.The viewer sits in on many strategy sessions, hears a portion of phone calls with others in the Clinton camp and sees the behind the scenes maneuvering of other staff members in creating the atmosphere for Clinton's election. The other side is studied briefly, too.George Bush's words and appearances serve as a counterpoint to illustrate the reasons for the tactics of the Clinton team.A great study of a political campaign in action."
4,Must-see for politicos,Engaging documentary that focuses mainly on James Carville and his passion for the Clinton campaign of '92. It's interesting to get a glimpse of what really goes on behind the scenes and it is fun to see the main players reacting to George Bush's campaign.
5,Fascinating,"A super companion to Stephanopoulos' new book ""All too Human."" This is a MUST SEE for all political junkies. Engaging, intersting, and surprisingly entertaining, THE WAR ROOM is the best available example of how to run a modern presidential campaign. Carville and Stephanopoulos make an unlikely successful team with charisma and chemistry. It is truly insider's look at the innerworkings of the train that leads to the most powerful destination on the planet. The only regret is that there was no follow up in 1996."
2,Bleh...,"I can't believe I watched this whole thing. If you are in any way interested in what goes on behind the scenes during a presidential campaign, this is for you. However, be warned that this material is very raw and dry with no central narrative to move you along. It's not a documentary in any sense of the term. It's more of a ""found footage"" shooting style."
3,I think its been misrepresented somewhat,This is not a film of the inner sanctum of Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign as claimed but a film of his head campaign managers office. You will see some discussions on issues. Nothing very controversial. You never see any real important decisions made and you see almost nothing of Bill Clinton.If you are interested in elections you probably will get some feel of how a modern campaign feels but little about much else.
5,For anyone with political dreams,"This is a great movie of just how campaigns and elections are handled. Great story of the most talented campaigner of this century, James Carville and how his team managed the campaign. Shows their highs and their tears. Entertaining and informative."
2,For Fans Only,I found this to be a collection of superficial soundbites. If a person is a fan of the major players they might enjoy seeing the interplay between them but for me this documentary is a bore.
1,no title,"Well, I sure could have skipped this one. I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me. Mostly, I was just plain bored. There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks. Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President. And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie. But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter."
3,"Very Interesting, but too One Sided!!!","Great for political junkies like me, but they should have shown more of the other campaigns as well. This video puts Clinton on a pedastal like everything said is just right-wing spin..LOL.Rent it or borrow from the library."
3,"Fascinating, but anything BUT groundbreaking...","The completely naive idea that this campaign was some kind of new groundbreaking approach to presidential campaigning, or that Carville and Stephanopolis re-wrote the book on such campaigns is sadly nothing more than left wing revisionist thinking being pasted across America's forehead once again. The fact that a decade earlier Michael Deaver orchestrated an even greater victory against Jimmy Carter and then again against Walter Mondale is the timeless proof that a successful and seemingly steamroller campaign strategy is nothing new to American Politics. Moreover it must be noted that the Carville/Stephanopolis duo were not the do-all/end-all vehicle that handed Mr. and Mrs. Clinton the Presidency. What this colorful documentary fails to note is that it was neither Clinton nor his campaigners that defeated George Bush in 1992. Three is indeed a crowd."
5,Jacobs K3C,"If you have an older Sears drill press with the 633C chuck, then it is virtually impossible to find this key - or even special order it - at your hardware or big-box store. While the original was a bit better - had a spring to eject from the chuck - you will appreciate the nice sharp new fluting and how well it now works in your drill press."
3,Not as good as the one that came with the drillpress,"This was closest I could find to the original which was made about 20 years ago. It doesn't have the quality of the original, however, it will work. If I hadn't found the original I would be fine."
5,"A Charming, Thoughtful and Enlightening Tale!","A wonderful original folktale with a message for ALL OF US. Griselda - the town ""grump"" is magically transformed by the gift of a scarf from a stranger. No longer the bitter old woman with a sharp word for all, Griselda (to her dismay) is able to only utter kindnesses to the people of the town. She learns that to HAVE a friend - you first have to BE a friend. Wonderful humor paired with delightful illustrations make this a book not only worth owning yourself but giving to your favorite child as a GIFT. This message is timeless - and this book is a KEEPER!!"
3,It's ok.,"I liked this one the 1st time I read it, but realized quickly that it wasn't really that great. Nice concept & decent illustrations, but I'm giving my copy away."
5,I dare you to be grumpy after reading this book!,"This is a tale set in the past that is all too timely today... A stranger visits and grumpy Griselda grudgingly offers her a place to stay. A chance encounter, an unexpected gift and a few words of kindness go a long way toward helping the lonely old woman realize the mighty benefits of caring for others. The simple story and bright illustrations have something for all ages -- my two year old loves how Griselda is always saying, ""Pah!"" and I love that I'm making a moral lecture fun for him while gently reminding myself to stop being negative... The Magic Kerchief is an inventive, enchanting tale that will teach people for generations both the importance of being kind as well as the true magic of a good book!"
2,The Perspiring Plain,"World War II is soon to end. We're in hot and humid Burma where you can count on one hand the number of scenes in which people aren't perspiring or wearing sweaty clothes. This becomes noticeable because the characters and narrative, in their cliched predictability, don't hold your attention. Brenda de Banzie has a lively turn as a Scots missionary, and Gregory Peck is convincing as a daredevil flyer who connects with an educated beauty improbably helping out in a jungle village. There's no doubt whatsoever which men in a plane crash will survive the long trek back to base. You have seen this movie many times before. You might possibly enjoy seeing it again."
3,An Angry Finch Goes to Burma,"The movie is okay and you could spend a worse 90 minutes. Gregory Peck is a little angrier than usual at the beginning but he converts to a total good guy later. Yet another hero saved by a good woman. The story and the characters just lack depth. You can't get into his sorrow over his wife because you don't know her. After he agonizes over her to the point of mental disease, he becomes a new man after meeting another woman for about a total of 3 hours. It just doesn't add up. On the other hand, the acting is very good across the board."
4,SOLID 4-STAR FILM; EXCELLENT DVD PRESENTATION,"It was unfortunate that the now-defunct MGM (Sony currently owns it) put the ""modified to fit your screen"" text at the beginning of ""THE PURPLE PLAIN"" DVD, as it simply was not necessary. Based on my knowledge of aspect ratios, the full-frame (1:33) presentation is likely the most accurate framing for this film. To my eyes, nothing was missing and no panning-and-scanning was to be seen.According to an online review at DVD Talk, ""although the main titles appear to be composed for 1:66, a 1:78 crop-off is too much. Released in 1954 and shot by an English crew, it could have easily been planned as a 1:37 release."" So enjoy this film and tell your friends and family about it. It truly is a lost classic and this DVD is a long-overdue treasure.The Scoffer has spoken...again!"
4,No pan & scan this time,"The silly lawsuit filed against MGM about nonsensical framing issues shouldn't lead to greet all MGM DVDs with suspicion. I didn't see this movie in theaters, but obviously it wasn't shot in any anamorphic aspect ratio, and widescreen movies in UK were not shot in 1,85:1 at the time. True, the DVD image seems a bit cramped at times, so my guess is, what we have here is an slightly reframed open matte version of a movie with an intended theatrical aspect ratio of 1,66:1 or maybe 1,75:1. But then, it's always difficult to check the exact aspect ratio delivered by a DVD because of the overscan inherent to most TV monitors (give it a try on your PC DVD drive, there's no overscan there)"
4,Not just another face in the crowd...,"Newcomer to the pop scene Ashley Ballard has her work cut out for her. Her first album, ""Get In The Booth,"" may sound very similar to others in the genre, most notably Hoku, Vitamin C and Mandy Moore. The smooth fourteen tunes on ""Booth"" may be click-track driven like all the rest, but Ashley holds a secret which you cannot discover from her first single, ""Hottie,"" alone:Ashley Ballard can sing.Throughout all the tracks, most notably the ballads, Ashley lends her powerful voice to keep the vibe of ""Southern California cool""--as this author likes to put it--flowing. Her vocals are rich and layered, and don't wimp out in the higher octaves. Simply put, Ashley can sing like Christina Aguilera.If you're a pop lover who wants to add some dimension to your music collection, or if you simply liked ""Hottie"" when you heard it on the radio, get a copy of ""Get In The Booth."" You won't be disappointed."
3,great alternative to Britney Spears,"There aren't many pop singers who can actualy sing... but Ashley Ballard can definitly sing!! It'll be great to see if she can do a second album,. I'm looking forward to more great music from Ashley. Vocaly she's one of the best bubblegum pop singers.Reccomended songs: Hypnotized, Hottie, All I Ever, Hi Lo, Girls Like Me, Second Thoughts, 5X5, No More Miss Nice"
3,Not a perfect design but better than regular tongs,"When we received this, the first thing we noticed was that it seems to be designed for right-handed people. Also, the way that the handles are curved/angled prevents it from working very well with certain pans. It's slightly easier to use than regular tongs but not by much."
4,easy,Works great easy clean up just make sure you have enough oil in your pan or use a deep fryer. I use small corn tortillas too.
5,nice prouct,Product works great and is very helpful due to the food allergies my husband has. He can now eat homemade hard shell taco's now.
2,not a good taco maker,"I have one of these. The picture is deceptive. These tongs actually just make a v shape taco. The picture shows the classic u shape. I have searched high and low for one that does the u shape with no luck. This product does work, if you don't mind having the v shape. (you will break the shell when you eat it)."
5,It works just like I expected,Its not fancy or made to last a life time but it works just like I expected. No problems with this product at all so far. We have a deep fryer that we heat up and dip the taco shells in that because it works best in deep oil.(plus its easier clean up that way)
3,Very pleased,"I purchased 2 of these because I make my own corn tortillas from corn flour and flour tortillas. Once you try made from scratch tacos you will never buy tacos from the store again, I promise you. So since this device is designed to either be submerged in fat or oil or doing one side then flipping the taco to the other side (which I prefer) I noticed when the one side cooked and I went to turn it, the other uncooked side pretty much fell apart. I solved this by: When the one side of the taco is frying in the oil, I take a metal dipper and pour the hot oil on the other side. This cooks it enough to when I need to take the taco out and switch it to the other side, it is stable enough to not crack. My sons LOVE my tacos and this device makes them beautifully uniform without all the puffy bubbles. Thank you."
3,It's ok,"Nice toll but would have been much better if the wires were bend so that they fit in the greese lengthwise. As they are, you need a whole lot of oil and a deep pan"
3,not easy,to use. flour tortillias would stick to it and I had to keep manipulating it to get a decent taco
2,Odd Neck,"The way the neck and Handle is shaped it is hard to sit in a deep fryer, with the necks shaped it only allows you to fry one side at a time and to get the other side done you need to rotate the shell not the tongs. I wish I had tried the rectangle basket mold instead."
3,taco tongs,"Right product, on time and as described. Doesn't fit well in my fryer and I probably will not use it anymore."
2,awkward for the pan and it sticks to the tortillas,I bought this hoping to help my family with the taco issue. I had problems with it the entire time. The tortilla stuck to it and the way it is set-up makes it difficult to get into the pan right
2,Lyne,"The problem with this item is that you cannot adequately fry both sides of the folded taco due to the way the handle is bent. It is bent properly to fry one side, but when you flip it over, it won't lay flat in the grease to fry the other side. I likely won't use it again."
3,Not the best for pan fry.,"These tongs were meant for a deep fryer. If you pan fry the shell it only does one side. Taco shells are the only thing I typically fry in my house and so I have no need for a deep fryer. There is a work around to pan fry it. Put enough oil in the pan to fry the one side that the angle of the tong lets you fry and keep the soft side from touching the oil. Once the one side is fried, CAREFULLY grab the exposed soft side, open the tong, rotate it, and then fry the other side. It's still faster than trying to hand fry with the old wadded tin foil in the center and so the cost isn't a total loss to me. I'll still keep my eye out for something better."
2,"Works, but....","In order to use this press effectively, the oil level in your fryer MUST be DEEP - deep enough to submerge the entire tortilla in one go. The switch-sides method mentioned in an earlier review just doesn't work well. Also, this press is too small for a standard 6-1/2 inch tortilla. The ends/tops get bent.Spend a little more and do it right."
3,Needs a lot of oil.,"I was hoping this would make our love of tacos even easier, but it doesn't. I have to use a 2-qt sauce pan and hold it vertically to fry the shells, occasionally getting burned by hot oil. It looks like one could use a shallow fry pan, but the oil just ins't deep enough to cover the entire tortilla."
1,Never again,"Just don't work for frying up taco shells, you can only do one side of the taco and then you have to flip it over in the holder to get the other side done."
2,NO taco press,"Product states rests on fryer pan, perhaps this is my error. To me there is a difference btw a fryer pan and a deep fryer. This product can only be used with a deep fryer. Do not buy unless you have a deep fryer."
2,The mouth is too wide,"The image of this product gives and impression you're purchasing a taco press that is going to shape the tortillas to look like store bought taco shells.But when I got the actual product shipped to me, I saw that the mouth is so wide that there's hardly any difference between making a flat crunchy tostada to taco shell.If you're looking for a taco press that can shape tortillas like store bought tacos, this product is not the one for you. The picture is very misleading."
5,Cool little gaget,"I like this taco press. Makes a much neater taco shell than my old way of folding the tortilla over a lump of foil. It works really well. You do need a deep well of oil to use it though. It will not work in a shallow frying pan. For 5 bucks, you can't beat the price."
3,Good Idea...Needs a little tweaking.,"This is a good idea for those who love to make homemade taco shells.The product definitely does need some tweaking.The first issue I have with it is that the handles should be bent upward for easy dipping into the oil. The way they are right now you have to keep on flipping the tortilla around in the oil instead of one even dip. This makes for uneven browning.The second issue is that the taco forms are not big enough and should be bent closed a bit more. I used the standard corn tortilla which is the small that you can buy and the edges curled out when put into the oil.Otherwise, it's a great product for those spur of the moment cravings for taco when you don't have boxed taco shells in the house."
3,taco press,I saw this on your site and ordered it because I always get to do the tacos on taco night. Have not used it as of yet but it lookslike it will out fine.
2,Just an average set of accessories.,"This is an ok set of compressor accessories. The quality is only average. I will be replacing almost everything with better quality components. For the money, you would be better off buying individual pieces that have some weight to them. The pressure gauge is a joke and is just an example as to what the other pieces are like. Save your money and go down to your local tool supply and get quality stuff."
3,Should have bought something else.,Wish I bought just the stuff I needed at Home Depot. Would have saved some money. Quality was not a problem though I have no use for the tire pressure guage.
1,Amazon recomended purchasing it; I returned it,"Amazon recomended buying this because others bought it. It arrived late, I had purchased it localy because I needed it, and I returned it for a credit."
4,You will appreciate more after many listening.,"This isn't one of my favourite album of Michael McDonald, but I appreciate it more now that I know it better. This is the second album of Michael, featuring Jeff Porcaro, David Pack, Nathan East, Paulinho da Costa."
1,disappointed,bought these for a birthday present and went to turn my first thing on my brand new lathe and it lasted about five minutes and one of the tools broke and now im dealing with a broken thumb and just was lucky that i had my face shield on. i would not buy these again.. the amazon store will not even let me return them for a new one
5,"A concise, easy to read book on writing business procedures.","Although this book was published in 1977, the instructions for developing and writing office procedures is very much in keeping with the current need for simplicity and clarity in business writing. I have written the type of procedures covered in this book for many years and recommend them as being the most easily understood and most often used by employees. I was glad to still see the book is in print and was so readily available from Amazon.com. Thank you"
5,Terrific Book!,"Being Italian-American, I really enjoyed this book! I also learned so much that I did not know about my culture. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Conversation, which include some insightful proverbs. Italians have always been a very proud and self-reliant people, as summarized in the wise and timeless Sicilian-American proverb - ""Cu s'aiuta Diu l'aiuta"" (God helps those who help themselves). I also enjoyed the list of words that were adapted from English (p.45) with the Italian dialect and morphological tones. Really nice book!"
5,Excellent reference guide and resource,"Through interviews, journals, and other primary sources, the authors have compiled the most comprehensive collection of Italian-American folklore to date. The data comes from both rural and urban communities and the authors pay special attention to regional differences within Italy. Included are proverbs, songs, games, folktales, foodways, superstitions, medicine, and many other topics that any Italian-American will appreciate.If you've ever wondered why you can't eat chicken on New Year's Day or why a pregnant woman should have her food cravings satisfied, this book will answer all your questions and more. Well-organized and clearly presented, Italian-American Folklore will help generations of Italian-Americans better understand their own traditions and culture and offer explanations some may have thought were long lost."
3,I guess you had to be there,"Nicholas Payne is one of those quirky, independent characters that I normally love, but Payne crosses over from eccentric to obnoxious. This book was published in the early 70s when rebellious youth triumphing over pompous members of the ""establishment"" (to borrow from the contemporary vernacular) was a popular theme, but looking back from the 21st century, Payne seems more of a spoiled brat than an iconoclastic rebel. McGuane is a good writer with an impressive command of the language, but at times, the obscurity of his words leaves one with the impression that he writes with an open thesaurus. Still, an interesting read with some funny moments."
2,Totally unlikable Protagonist,"I was so turned off by the protagonist who felt a right to do awful things to people because he was such a ""Free Spirit"" or ""Intellectual"" that I very quickly lost interest in the whole book, no matter how clever the writer was in turning a phrase. I haven't encountered such a total turn off as the central figure in a book since the Gawd-awful Confederacy Of Dunces."
2,Disappointing,"Tom McGuane is a very talented writer, but those expecting the near-poetry of his short, experience-based gems will probably find the longer, presumably serious, stuff quite tedious. Though it is probably unfair that I have also been reading some Cormac McCarthy at the same time."
4,misidentification,"This is a fantastic picture, but the man in it is not Gregory Peck, but George Peppard, since this scene is from Breakfast at Tiffany's and Gregory Peck didn't appear in that movie."
3,Twinings Ceylon Tea,"I have for years used Twinings tea, but have never tried this type.I found the cost very affordable, more so then in the stores.We didn't not like it but prefer the ""breakfast tea"". We did however share it with our son who drinks tea and he loved it. So there you have it one loved it the other can drink it, but prefer not. F.E"
5,Superb Tea!,"This is rather expensive in our local grocery store (Ingles) and I cannot even find it at Wal-Mart! But here on Amazon they've got the BEST deal and man what a smooth taste! You'll love it! Hey try out my tea:Lovelace's Southern Sweet TeaIngredients: 3 Twinings Ceylon Orange Pekoe Tea Bags and 1 1/3 cup of sugar (or Splenda or 2/3 Sugar and 2/3 Splenda to cut calories)Directions: Pour full coffee pot of water into Coffee maker, put 3 tea bags in drainage area. Allow Pot to fill with Hot tea. Meanwhile, put 1 1/3 cup sugar in your pitcher (or container) after tea's done brewing pour in over sugar. Mix well to ensure sugar has dissolved. Next, pour in enough cool water to fill or for iced tea put in enough ice cubes to make it. Makes 1 gallon of Sweet (southern) Tea. YUMMY!"
3,New taste for old tea or bad lot?,"I've been drinking this tea every morning for several years so, needless to say, I love it. Strong, mellow, rich, well-rounded. Typically, I would give it a 4 star.Just recently, however, I purchased several boxes at a local grocery store and was shocked to find the taste completely different and largely tasteless. 1 star at best. I don't know if something happened to one particular lot or if the company has changed the formula."
5,Tea time,"This tea is one of my favorites. It is light without tasting like murky water, and the flavor holds up well to milk."
4,good but needs a little kick,"I have bought this for a while. It is nice but just does not have that strong a tea flavor. I mix this half and half with Twinings English breakfast tea. All-in-all a nice orange flavor but could use a little stronger tea flavor to go with it. Try it, I think that you may just like it. By the way I have tried the Lipton and Celestial teas but they do not have as strong an orange flavor."
5,Only Tea I Drink,"If you are looking for a tea that will not give you the jitters, but delivers the full aroma of a great cup of tea, this is it. A friend gave me my first cup a few years back. I became a tea snob and have loved it every since."
3,Submarine X-1 : Review,"Not a lot of action, but I loved the film for its semi-realistic drama/action and adventure portrayed by the actors at that time."
2,"""B"" Submarine Moview",This one does not rank as a classic. It just sort of ranks. But the DVD quality is excellent.
2,Mediocre submarine flick,"Can someone please tell me why an American (and one with a think Bronx accent, no less!) is in charge of a British submarine?????"
2,GPX disc skip system,"If i breathe it skips, and i cannot even get a hold of Gpx to complain. It does not move from song to song easily, causing me to ""play"" with it to much even in the car. The price is nice, but i would never buy another GPX item again!!!"
2,Pools and Spas,"There are some good ideas and landscape ideas in this book for designing spas and pools. In the end I probably only spent 20 minutes in this book and didn't get a whole lot out of it. We spent a considerable amount of money on our pool but we live in Arizona and the landscape ideas didn't apply to this climate. Overall, lots of pretty pictures. 2 out of 5 stars."
5,Amazing!!!!!!!,"I LOVE this CD!!! I've seen the band live and I didn't think it was possible for the CD to capture the energy of the live show. But I was sooo wrong! From beginning to end this CD had me dancing. They have the perfect blend of Salsa, Funk, R&B, Rock & Roll... I was even captivated by the 2 slow songs, Bolero de Salon and Rain. This is definately one of the best latin bands to come out in a long time! I strongly recommend it to everyone!!!"
4,Anti-Yankee Southern humor but where are the Blacks?,"A humoristic and extreme vision of the South confronted to the invasion of the Yankees. But a strange vision indeed. No Blacks what so ever. A clean white South, just as some would have liked it to be and as it has never existed. This enables the director to show Yankee villains since they only have one objective : to conquer and govern this rebellious South. But it is hilarious in many ways and there are some elements that are good. The trick to make old teetotallers drink alcohol is banal. But the dog is very good and has been well trained, just like these Southeners who become supermen when they hear their Southern national anthem. If you are nostalgic about a past that did not exist and if you are not concerned by unreality then you will find this story amusing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
5,"well-done, and very interesting.","I try these types of movies, but often don't finish watching them. I watched this in full, which meant to me that it was not only interesting, but wasn't looking to ""pound"" anyone. After watching the movie, I looked on amazon to see the reviews, and there are complaints about it being one-sided. This made me reconsider my original opinion, so yes, it may be somewhat one-sided, but personally I like that they portrayed the opponents as regular people, who in many cases were following their own conscience. Two people can follow their conscience and still disagree. Regardless, I learned a lot and am grateful for the knowledge."
1,Irresponsible,"This ""documentary"" is set in upstate New York, where a bunch of greedy people decided they could live in a community with windmills. The whole premise of this movie is flawed as the director claims wind energy is bad. A Four hundred foot windmill in your backyard is bad, stupidity is bad, greed is bad. But Wind energy is not bad. This ""Documentary"" almost seems as if it were funded by soemone whom might have an interest in scaring people off of wind and solar energy... HMMMM who might that be?"
3,Good but . . .,I got this book and found it very interesting. Loved learning about how young earth proponents deal with the radiometric dating. This book is very helpful and gives a good overview of the strengths and weaknesses of this field of study. Despite all this I do have one complaint that kindle version had distorted diagrams. This maybe a good reason to choose the paper copy.
5,Thousands not Billions,"This book hit the major ways we see the things on earth dated, and also went more in depth to other dating methods the layman doesn't normally see. It gave specific data on each test done, using the scientific method, and was clear and concise in it's results. It didn't try to change anyone's mind, just let you look at the results and compare them with others, as well as giving you a hypothesis for reasons behind discrepencies. Let's you decide for yourself if you think these dating methods are accurate or not."
1,"Faith, not science","This is not a science book -- as the blurb says, it is a work of apologetics.I would highly recommend insteadNature's Clocks: How Scientists Measure the Age of Almost Everything"
1,Poorly made,"I drove a total of approximately 50 nails into joist hangers before the hammer end fell off and rolled across the floor. The threads on the shaft that connect it to the nailer had fractured, presumably because this component was incorrectly heat treated. Now I'll go buy a name brand like I should have in the first place."
4,Palm Nailer,"There is a learning curve to use this specialty nailer. Practice on scrap wood first before using. In hard to get at places where a hammer will not do, or a screw cannot be used, it is indispensable. It works well."
2,problems,"I do not have a lot of experience with palm nailers,bought it thinking if toolcrib sells it then it must be contractor grade...All those little attachments sure show a lot of wear fast,do not see them lasting very long.The real frustration is that I never know when it will work.IT JAMS . Sometimes it seems to go ok , then it stops.Anyhow mostly it sits at home now,it is embarrassing to have tools that do not work.From my perspective it is not a good buy"
5,Correction on material,"I work for TRADESMAN and I feel a need to correct something from the review of eia1805. Although he may be disatified with our Palm Nailer, it's housing is 100% Die-Cast Aluminum, there is no plastic on it. Both Stanley, Senco and Porter Cable as well as the TRADESMAN all have the same basic weight of close to 3 lbs.It is unfortunate that [some have] had problems with the glove and with the overall usage of the product. We hope that the Porter Cable gives him many years of quality performance.We have been selling our Palm Naler for over 15 years with great success and very little consumer return. Again we are sorry for the problems we may have caused eia1805.Bob JamesVice PresidentTRADESMAN Power Tools"
2,Only a Single Job item,"I was foolish enough to buy this nailer at [...]for a (large) addition/remodel where I knew I'd be installing a ton of joist hangers. The nailer was lightweight, which was nice but I have to admit it felt much cheaper than the Senco and Porter Cable I compared it to. I ended up buying it on price alone. Well, I certainly got what I paid for. The leather palm strap came apart after installing approx. 10 joist hangers. The entire body is plastic, and my hand started to ache with vibration during the rest of the project due to it's feather weight. Had to clean it three times as well. I learned my lesson and replaced it with a Porter Cable from Amazon.com [...]. It was [$$$] more but the quality more than paid for itself. If you want a ""single project"" nailer on the cheap it works ok. If you want a tool that will stay in your shop for years this definately isn't it."
5,"Spicy, cool and smooth","Smooth and rhythmic grooves with a throbbing beat flow from one to another with the greatest of ease, and take you with them. The sound is spacy, the rhythm is pulsing, and the mood is mellow -- all at once. A nice selection. Like having your own private lounge DJ for an hour or so. Nice."
4,A bit esoteric,"I tried to read this on Kindle, and wouldn't recommend it for that because I wanted to page backward and forward to read previous sections. She bases her discussion on a personal experience in the convent that was hard for me to relate to as a layperson. Despite that, her book worked for me because it was also based on Scripture. But I'm not sure I want to read any more of her work."
5,Finding the blessing in struggle,I found this book to bring great comfort and insight to my own life. Couldn't put it down.
4,Encouraging,"In terms of the Christian theme, what Ron Dunn writes for non-Catholic Christians, Sister Joan writes for Catholics. However, this book is more than simply inspiring for its common reminder to place our faith in God. The author's honest and emotionally difficult (albeit, relatively ""cushy"") journey tells Catholics that The Church, for all its faults, is progressing toward justice, after all. For Catholics, therin lies the real hopefulness of this work."
3,if only she would lose the verbosity!,"I came to this with high hopes since a clergy friend had highly recommended it. I will say that there are some nuggets of gold in here, but they are buried under a ton of words before she reveals them. She tells us that the great struggle of her life was as a young nun who was accepted into a Master's creative writing program when at the last minute her mother superior decided she was not to go. As a pastor who has heard and supported many people through various real struggles and tragedies, my first reaction was, ""Oh, for crying out loud, get a grip!"" However, calling upon my more gracious side, I acknowledged that, for her, the denial of her life's dream might indeed be the greatest tragedy of her life."
2,Long on platitudes; short on reason,"Recommended to me by a former nun I much admire, I am sorry to write that I found Sr. Chittister's book tedious: very often she followed one phrase with another that repeated the same idea. Usually she did it in threes. ""We find ourselves on a wet, grey slope of sliding clay, being towed under, being swallowed up and taken down, no towline to save us.""Perhaps if I were in crisis I might find her poetic phrasing a comforting and understanding expression, but I was interested in a theodicy that was rarely presented. I did appreciate her reminding the reader that nothing is permanent on earth, and if we have survived struggle in the past, we might have faith that we can survive it again.I am very glad I borrowed this book from a library and did not buy it."
1,Unsure,My morals and values are that of a Christian origin. In the book it states the author is a mysticist.I chose not to open it.The arrival of it was timely.
5,"Good Companion to ""Following the Path""",Sister Joan Chittister is one of my favorite writers. Every book is a gem and all need to be around so you may re-read them. This is an excellent companion to her other book about life changes. I am glad to have them both.
4,Great marker set!,"This is a great marker set - the previous reviewer was correct about the pink being low on ink right out of the package, however.They're a little chunky and easy to hold in your hand, and I love the built-in eraser caps - I'd never seen any like this before.I think you'll be really happy with this set, unless PINK is your favorite color - you may want to pick a different set if that's the case..."
5,Nia for Chronic Paine,"Nia for chronic pain, March 7, 2010The joy of Nia is its flexibility. I have fibromyalgia, RA and asthma. Nia is something I can do because it is flexible.....it encourages you to do things at your own pace. You do not need to try to 'keep up with everyone else"". I took just one Nia class while visiting my sister and knew this would be good for me. I live in an area where there are no Nia classes. I have ordered some of the DVD's on line. Just try Nia! You will probably decide that this is the low impact, great range of motion exercise that your body needs."
1,badly produced,"Though the Nia routine is good, the dvd makes it very hard to follow and not very pleasant to watch. This is a ""class"" and the students movements obscure the instructors movement so that there's really little focus on the instructor. In other words there's so much movement onscreen, it's disorienting to watch. The instructor wears big bell bottoms and it disorts the body's natural lines. The studio it's shot in is drab, and the whole visual experience is sub-par. The music adds nothing and is ordinary. Too bad, if you can follow it anyway, the workout is good."
2,Acceptable design let down by low-quality hoses,"Not a bad product, if you discount the sub-standard hoses. Before I even tried to use the hose, a leak was evident in the fittings of the connector hose, which had to be replaced before use. Since the manufacturer is in Australia, I just paid for a new connecting hose rather than try to send the defective one halfway around the world to get a replacement."
1,AK self=rewinding reel,"A piece of junk..would not work, and sent it back to the company, and they said they couldn't make it right. Never got it back (hose was good) but paid the shipping to send it to Texas.Only bad product received from Amazon."
2,1st 20 mins,the first 20 minutes of the cd are fine but there after it sounds like it was recorded from outside i know sound clash tapes vary in quality but this is a shambles
1,"If I could rate this lower, I would","Such a waste of money! Not that everyone else hasn't already said what my bf and I are thinking. Boy, do I wish we'd read the reviews before buying them at the store. The hiss and static is unbearable, and renders the headphones useless when you are trying to assess the quality of audio files (which is what my bf is trying to do). The range isn't even that great on them; my dad had a pair of wireless headphones when I was growing up, where I could go outside and mow the lawn and still listen to music - with these we can barely be 2 rooms over in our apartment. The only nice thing was that they are comfortable on your head. Frankly, I expected better of Sony, and this is sorely disappointing. Hopefully we can return them."
2,Big answer to peoples feelings,"Just bought this product at Best Buy tonight. I, like many people, am not happy with the product. Hisses, pops, it sounds like broadcast radio, which is exactly what it is. We live in this world of digital media whether its Mp3 or CD audio.. If you are accustomed and awed by CD quality audio, you wont be happy. If you just wanna watch an episode of a tv show without disturbing your roommates, then you might not care so much. all this thing, or ANY wireless headphone product does is transmit a signal from digital to analog similar to a radio station, cordless phone, etc... its only gonna sound so good no matter what you do. many other people would be happy with this. I realized that working in radio and hearing digital audio every day makes me somewhat biased. It's compressed and crappy If you are looking for ""digital quality wireless audio"" then you should forget it, as it's impossible. just get a long cord, it will save you a lot of headache."
2,Marginal at best,"I bought the Sony wireless cans about a year ago and now I'm looking for an upgrade. The headphones have this really annoying trait in that they constantly hiss. The only way to work around that is to turn up the volume (practically all the way) on the TV and compensate by turning down the volume on the headphones. Just make sure that you don't blow your speakers when you switch back to your normal audio system.In addition, the sound quality is quite inconsistent while moving."
1,Shockingly Bad Design,"This must be amongst the worse of Sony's normally great product designs. It is very difficult to align the headphone socket (for recharging) into the baseset plug. To make it worse, the headsets dont sit well on the baseset, which causes it to fall off easily. It can take up to several minutes to get the phones to sit on the base and to align its socket......this product must have been approved for production without any product testing.The hiss is awful, and the reception ability is bad - I use it just 10 feet from my TV but a slight turn of the head can throw off the reception.Awful, awful, awful.....and I am even a Sony fan."
1,terrible reception,"The reception on these things is terrible. I turned up every possible volume control in the source sequence (they were hooked to my computer). This helped a lot, but it was still not enough. About 15ft away in my living room the static hiss was unbearable. If I turned my head to a slightly different angle things got better. They're very directional.I bought a pair of Sennheiser RS120's for about the same price and man, they are 100% better. I can go anywhere in my house and get excellent reception. In addition the headphones themselves sound much better. The frequency response is better, and the acuracy of the soundstage is better. The RS120's low end is still weaker than my Grado SR60's, but acceptable."
2,Can't get rid of static,"It is totally annoying, I have tried almost everything, turn on/off the noise reduction, switch to every one of the 3 channels it is supposed to work with. However I have been unable to get rid of the static.The rest of the features are quite good, the automatic on/off feature works perfect and the placement in the based is not difficult. Unfortunately, they lack the most important characteristic: quality sound"
1,The worst!,I own a lot of Sony products. I had some extra Sony points to use. I bought these worthless headphones for $70. No wonder they were discounted! I get hiss 10 feet away (alot). I bought a device to clean the power supplied to no avail. These are worthless unless you think AM is better than CD for sound.
1,I thought I found a bargain...was I ever wrong,"I really liked the idea of wireless headphones (who doesn't?) as it's one less cable to trip over, or step on and break, and the only set I ever saw was down at my local music store for like $200. I have always liked Amazon for the great price breaks one can get here, so I did a search and decided that these, with the Sony name, at that price was an unbelievable value. My dad always told me that whatever seems too good to be true usually is, and that was definitely the case in this instance. These headphones SUCK period.They dont have great fidelity and the hissing noise is intolerable. DON'T BUY THESE HEADPHONES! Amazon, I'd advise you to drop them from your catalogue."
4,Good value and work well,It is wonderful to walk around the house and use these very comfortable head phones.It you turn up the volume on the receiver or any other device you have them plugged into they work great.Nice that I can watch TV late and not bother anyone else in the house.I would recommend them to anyone.I am waiting for a bluetooth option to work as well.
3,Just mediocre,Pros - good fit and easy on your ears. I like the auto on/off feature and have not had a problem putting the units back on the charging stand.Cons - these phones are only good for short distances (less than 12 feet) and the futher you are away the more background noise you get. If this is how all wireless headphones are I won't be buying anymore for a long time !
1,Piece of Junk,Bought the item on 08/05/06. By 11/05/06 the headphones were completly broken. Not that they were very good to begin with. They would often just pop and I would hear nothing but static. The sound wasn't always too clear to begin with away. The cost to replace them with factory refurbished headphones was $30. The cost to repair them was $40. These headphones are junk - buy something better
2,Ve a lo seguro compra sennheiser,los consegui aqui en amazon y hoy mismo me han llegado 3.21.07 pero q desepcion casi se escucha mas fuerte la interferencia q existen en todos los inalambricos q la musica q tratas de escuchar en ellos q perdida de 75 dollares no los regresare porq esas dos estrellas se las han ganado por no averlos mandado a hacer en china pero si tienes dudas en q comprar ve alo seguro ve con sennheiser.
3,not very happy,I liked everything about this unit except the way it worked. There was a back round hiss that I couldn't get rid of so I returned the product.
1,UNIT DID NOT WORK FROM THE START,UNIT WAS PROPERLY INSTALLED BUT FAILED TO WORK.THE FAILURE WAS DEFECTIVE HEADSET. DID NOT MEET TIME SCHEDULE FOR RETURN SO I STILL HAVE THE UNIT. NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM SONY.
1,The Worst Sony Product I've Ever Purchased,"This is an unbelievable disapointment. I thought replacing a 5 year old headphone by Advent would be an improvement of the years. Its not worth 10 cents. Lots of backround noise, And the range well let me tell ya about the range. It says 150 ft. I get about 25 ft."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Worse....","Never thought I would make a mistake buying Sony... Well, I did this time... What a horrible product, it gives me headaches with all the noise, all the interference. Don't waste your money, these headphones are not even worth the unexpensive price you'll pay for them..."
1,Sony name don't mean a thing on this junk,I replaced a cheaper pair of Acoustic Research wireless headphones with this more expensive model from Sony. Bought it at the store without researching (bad move) and largely on the strength of the Sony brand name (I should know better).I have been very disappointed in their performance. There is hissing and noise all the time. There is no on/off switch. The tuning dial is not conveniently located for me--I keep having to take the headphones off to adjust the dial. And they don't fit very comfortably either.Steer clear of this junk.
1,STATIC NOISY INTERUPTIONS UNCLEAR INTERFERENCE,"not a good deal at 80.00 bucks. it is a rip off, or i got the first one made and it's made all wrong. i want my money back and someone please tell me what happend to SONY ????"
4,Very nice set of headphones,"I just got a pair of these this past Father's Day and after three days of use, I love them! I have them hooked up to my receiver through the headphone jack so I can watch TV or movies at any volume I want without disturbing the family at night, or while other people are in the room reading or whatever.The base doubles as a charging stand, so they are always ready to go. The base also only broadcasts when it detects an audio signal. The headphones themselves only turn on when they are on your head. All very well planned out and designed.I haven't tested the whole 150ft range, but I have been able to get all over the house and still get good sound quality. My only problem with them so far is I wish the adjustable strap could get a little tighter ... they feel a little loose on my head. Other than that, a great set of headphones!"
1,Too much static noise,"All the other features are great, except for the noise. Even the sound is good but it is once again ruined by the static. Returning mine right away."
1,The Worst Sony Product I've Ever Purchased,"I don't usually bother writing reviews, but for these headphones I feel it's a public service to warn others away.I had a pair of Sony wireless headphones before, which came with my old Sony XBR television. The old ones worked great, so when I bought a new LCD XBR Bravia, I thought it was an easy match to buy these headphones to go with it.I was shocked by how badly they worked. Dropped power on the base unit, popping, hissing, and mediocre, hard to adjust controls; basically everything that others have already said in previous reviews. But, they look great and they are very comfortable to wear, they have Sony's elegance in design. The problem is they are just a crummy product. I'm really surprised at Sony for letting something like this out the door."
1,Worst experience ever had,I never thought i will write such a bad review on a Sony product.This product really sucks. You can hear only static and sometimes it works fine for a maximum of 5 seconds and God only knows when it will work fine. I tried all suggestions given by other reviewers here to get rid of the static and failed miserably. Thank god i got with a refund policy and has sent it back the second day.Don't buy this product if you really want to use it. I am giving 1 star because there is no option for 0 stars.
4,wireless headphone review,The product performs very well. A little more to it than I thought it was going to be but not complicated. The one draw-back is that they are very bulky. Not heavy mind you but bulky. Uncomfortable to lay in bed and watch TV with the headphones on next to a sleeping spouse. Today headphones don't have to be so bulky to be effective.
2,Disappointed with Sony,"I get a lot of interference, painfully loud popping sounds in the earphones (maybe from wireless car security devices in my densely populated neighborhood). I can alleviate this problem somewhat by reducing the earphone volume drastically, and then increasing the source level to compensate. Still annoying, but not painful.Placing the earphones on the charging interface on the transmitter is very difficult and frustrating. After trying to do this for an extended period on one occasion, I was tempted to throw the whole pile of c@*! into the trash.I've owned many Sony Products, and until now, thought they were all excellent."
3,sony cordless stereo headphones,"satisfactory in what it seks to achieve, but rechaarging the headphones on the cradle is a clumsy process that could certainly be improved."
2,This product blew my confidence in Sony electronics!,"Hard to describe how disappointed I am in this wireless headset! Problems: #1) No mechanical lead-in for the alignment of the headset to charger base. Can't be set in correct position on charger without extreme attention to detail and both hands. #2) The RF band (ISM) used for signal to headset is used by so much other consumer electronics that I have noise interruptions about every 10 to 15 minutes on all frequencies it uses (Cordless phones, Crib monitors, Security systems, local Fire department). #3) Use distance is very limited, and Head orientation will wipe out signal. I find the usable distance is less than 20 foot. If I want to drop volume 6 db, all I need to do within that 20 foot range is turn my head 30 to 45 degrees from the ""clear signal"" head position.In the past I always choose Sony with confidence, NO more!"
3,Good sounding comfortable headphones.,"The good:Very comfortable headphonesGood sound qualityAuto tuning feature works well as you don't have to play with tuning dialThe bad:Constant static and hiss all the time, even a few feet from the transmitter. The static really takes over the otherwise good quality sound. I do live in a metropolitan area, so maybe these would work better in a rural area, or maybe this is the nature of wireless headphones."
1,Noisy and inconvenient. Avoid these turkeys !,"These headphones seemed like a good idea at the time. I got them for late night TV listening, and occasionally they sound wonderful, but their background hiss is intrusive, varying from almost OK to maddening, depending on head position (even if you are 5 feet away from the base), and is usually worst when you in the optimal viewing position. Nothing seems to improve it - moving the base, changing channels, etc... Also it usually takes a couple of minutes of fiddling around to set the stupid things on the base correctly so that the battery will charge. Altogether a waste of time and money."
1,"Comfortable, but useless.","These headphones are very comfortable. Unfortunately I have a very difficult time with the headphones as they typically drop the audio signal at least 3 or 4 times a day, cutting to static - which can be painful. To get the signal back I must unplug the base station and plug it back in.Most often I must turn my head to a specific angle to get the signal clearly, as otherwise there is a constant static in the background of the music.The sound with a clear signal is decent, and gives OK sound in the lower range, but the highs are not as crisp as I would prefer."
2,A mistake,"I bought these at a local store, not really knowing what to expect. I tried them out the first night and was only able to get the hiss out for a few minutes at most. The sound was adequate but I had to have it turned up to minimize the interference. In its defense however I have numerous devices that could be causing the interference (baby monitor, cordless phone, LCD screen etc...).... Needless to say I returned them the next day and ordered the Pioneer SE-DIR800C. I know a huge price difference (I'm sure my wife will kill me when the credit card bill comes in), but with IR and the great reviews I feel it was the logical move...I can't wait til it comes in."
1,very disappointed,I usually don't pay attention to these reviews because I feel they are put in by employees of the company that is promoting the product. I am making the effort to right a review of this product because I just wasted a lot of money. I lasted two days with these headphones and now they just sit on the shelf. Major problems with reception and static pops. Just giving you a heads up.
1,Not satisfied!,"Sony MDR-RF960RK 900 MHz RF Wireless Headphones are full of hiss,even sitting stationary the hiss will come and go. The volume on my receiver must be turned up loud to get anything close to get halfway decent sound out of them. Over priced! After the Sonys I purchased Acoustic Research 900mhz Wireless Headphones AW771, they are less money and much better!"
1,Piece of Junk,"These headphones are the worst piece of audio equipment I've experienced. As an avid audiophile, I can honestly state this is one of the worst of my investments in audio gear. Problems:1. Cheap construction.2. Very difficult to keep the signal tuned in when you move your head or lean down.3. Bass response is excellent. The highs are very tinny.4. Cannot get rid of the hiss no matter how much you change channels. Very annoying!5. The volume control wheel and channel tuning button are difficult to locate when the phones are on your head.6. No adjustment for the head strap. The phones fit very loose unless you have a super large head.I'm going back to my corded set until I find something better."
3,Sony MDR-RF960RK 900 MHz RF Wireless Headphones,Headphones have slight static feedback. Setting the headphone to charge in the charger is difficult especially for older folks. You have to get it in exactly the right spot for it to charge.
3,Can't complain for the price,"I bought these headphones as a Christmas gift to my husband in 2005. He loves them. And I love them more because he can go in the kitchen, mute the TV, and I can continue sleeping without having to listen the TV. When my parents were visiting this past month they really liked them and my Dad ended up buying one through Amazon. Needless to say, he loves them too. Since he's retired he has more time to watch TV or listen to music. This way he can sit in the family room and listen to the TV/Stereo without having to listen to my mother's noise in the background. He's even sat in the W/C and enjoyed his programs! A little static but not enough to be annoyed with."
4,Sony MDR-RF960RK,Just received mine today. After I charged the batteries the headphones work very well. Before they were charged I could hear lots of static but that went away after charging. The only real problem is that the rechargable batteries that come with this unit don't appear to be very available. I looked online but couldn't locate any. I guess that it is a good thing that any AAA battery will power the headphones but the headphone system charger is designed not to charge them thus the reason why I only gave them 4 stars. These work well all over my apartment and do exactly what I need them to do.
1,Piece of junk - Wish I could rate it lower,"Awful design. Reception full of hiss and static. So what if it has a decent range when you can't hear jack. And putting it on the recharge cradle is a herculean task requiring the hand eye coordination of a jedi. Go for a infra-red based headphones - even the sony ones are ok. Even though they have lower range, sound quality is much better. The tradeoff between sound quality and range should be a no-brainer."
3,Not too shabby.,"The over-exaggerated negative reviews are a little annoying and when I got these today before searching Amazon, I was a bit worried.Turns out that if you just follow all of the directions, you hear little to no static if you're in the same room as the transmitter. Problem is distance. I would never go even 50 feet with these and that's only a third of the promised reception area. But, like many other wireless things, walls and other barriers in your environment can affect the sound quality.Tinker with them and you should hear little to no static and the static you hear should be covered by your audio, anyhow. Three for not living up to the promise on the package. Other than that, not too shabby."
3,Okay,"Lots of background noise, difficult to tune.Yet if you turn the volume of the source (like your laptop, etc..), the signal becomes a lot better for some reason.These headphones are not pefect, but they are cheap for what they do."
2,Very poor quality reception,This product was advertised as having a very long range which made it very attractive. I get static when I'm standing only a foot away from the base and the auto tune does nothing. It definitely does NOT perform as advertised.
4,Interesting...,This is an interesting cd. It is all covers from Dashboard Confessional songs. We actually used a song off of this cd for my wedding. The parents walked in to Hands Down.
3,"Great, but by no means perfect....","By reading the reviews you'd think that this handy item was the answer to all your prayers. Certainly it cooks chicken really well, draining the juices off nicely. No hestitation in recommending it for that. But the design has 2 flaws:1. The bowl at the bottom is very small and with most chickens you'll find that it gets filled quite quickly. You'll need to have another item underneath to catch juices, especially when it comes to taking it out of the oven (unless you've got rock steady hands)2. Once you've got it out of the oven, you've then got to get the chicken off the roaster. During the cooking process the insides of the chicken that touch the metal tend to stick a little so this is by no means an easy process, especially when you've got boiling hot liquid in the bowl underneath.Other than that, I'd recommend it, but certainly not 5 stars."
5,Works!,"What can you say about such a simple item? I used Emeril's recipe for a vertical chicken roaster and it was yummy. I did brine the chicken overnight as recommended on another recipe site. I put the roaster in a cake pan to catch stray drips. To get the hot chicken/roaster out of the cake pan and onto a platter, I inserted a bent wire (cut up wire clothes hanger) into the neck cavity and hooked onto the roaster and lifted it out and placed in onto a platter (or else I would have had to use a lot of paper towels). From there it was easy to get the chicken off the roaster. Oh, before I took the chicken out of the cake pan, I used a turkey baster to suck up all the liquid (drippings and a little water) to prevent spills. Saved all that liquid, defatted and threw it in with the bones later to make some stock. Clean up was easy. I did PAM the thing, don't know if that made a difference. Also the wires come off for easier cleaning and efficient storage."
5,vertical poultry roaster best we've seen,"We have owned several versions of this item, smaller ones, different materials, but this one is the most substantial and best quality we've seen. We were pleasantly surprised."
5,My favorite roaster!,I love this product. It makes roasting healthier and also looks fun. it is easy ton use and to clean. It's just the right size for my oven. I even used it to serve the chicken right from the oven to the table. I love it and can't imagine my kitchen without it!
1,Not the real women,"This is likely a tribute cd - in other words, Bjork, PJ and Tori are being covered by other people. Purchase with caution. I recommend buying cds from the actual musician as their talent is evident in their long lasting careers."
3,AC Power Adapter and Driver on CD missing from package,"My pal has been using this item for about 4 months now. He says it works great. So I decided to order one from Amazon.It arrived minus the AC Power Adapter and the Driver on CD.I called Amazon and was adviced to re-package and return the item.A refund was made to me even though I had indicated that they should re-send me a complete package.I have now ordered the same item from Amazon again. Fingers crossed, hope the package is complete this time."
3,"Black ""Lincoln"" 8 Ounce Antique Popcorn Machine and Cart","Black ""Lincoln"" 8 Ounce Antique Popcorn Machine and Cart was recieved damaged...decided to just live with it because it's too hard to try and repack for return. The unit is not as big as i would have expected and not as well crafted as i would have like...however, it does make really great popcorn!! I put it in our media room and it really makes it smell like a real theater when we are watchinmg movies and sporting events!"
4,"Another ""Must-Have""","Prince's ""Sgt. Pepper""...People thought he let his sucess get to him after Purple Rain, but the truth is, Prince had this one finished before Purple Rain was even released to the public. A true show of his talent and sense of artistic adventure. This is the kind of thing that made waiting for a new Prince album worth it."
5,Prince Is A GOD!!!,"I am a huge Prince fan and this is without a doubt his best album. The only albums that come close are Graffiti Bridge or The New Power Generation albums. This is Prince at his best with the greatest Prince songs ever ""Temptation and Paisley Park"". This album can't be touched. Buy this and then buy Graffiti bridge and then The New Power Generation albums. Kick ASS and Enjoy."
4,"Inconsistent, but buy just for TAMBORINE - stone cold funk!","Typical of Prince to all but dare his newfound ""fans"" who climbed on the bandwagon during ""Purple Rain"" to buy this inconsistent neo-psychadelic effort - fans like me who were into him during ""Dirty Mind"" and even before knew what was in store: everything but the kitchen sink! Many of these tracks are weak, drag on, or overblown, but buy it simply for the three great traxx: top of the list is the manic, off-kilter stone-cold funky TAMBORINE - one of Prince's most demented, yet potent jams - WOW! Pop confections like ""Rasberry Beret"" and ""Pop Life"" run close second - both are perfect radio-friendly singles that scored big - Prince knows how to write a hook, but he also indulges his own tangents - I just wish he could write songs as tight and simple and perfect now...can he still? Dunno - let's pull some more 80s nuggets outta the vault!"
2,Interesting chiefly as an historical document.,"After the mega-success of ""Purple Rain"", Prince was visited by the demon of Temptation. As he said in an interview, ""Do you know how easy it would have been for me to just do another version of Let's Go Crazy?"" But Prince smote the demon and posted a Dilettantes Not Welcome sign outside the purple clubhouse with this willfully peculiar record. That took more guts than I'll ever have, and the Skinny M.F. gets eternal props from me for it.Unfortunately, the music doesn't hold up. Except for the perfect single ""Raspberry Beret"", these songs just sort of slouch all over the place, never really coming together. But great days were coming..."
2,BELOW AVERAGE,"THIS IS ONE OF PRINCE'S WEAKEST ALBUMS TO DATE AFTER GREAT ALBUMS LIKE PURPLE RAIN, 1999, CONTROVERSY, DIRTY MIND .. HE RELEASE GARBABGE OUT SIDE OF RASPBERRY BERET, AND POP LIFE THERE ISNT NOTHING ELSE TO LISTEN TO.. THE BALLAD CONDITION OF A HEART IS INTERESTING BUT NOT NECCESARILY ONE OF HIS BEST BALLADS SO I GIVE IT A HALF OF STAR .. VERY DISAPPOINTING EVEN IN 1999"
2,A terrible mess,"Though the tritle track, ""Pop Life"", and ""Rasberry Beret"" are all fantastic, there is not much else to this album. The rest finds Prince in a transistion, trying to to move past the Minneapolis funk of PURPLE RAIN. While, that is respectable, most of the songs can be hard to sit through, without pushing the button on your cd player for the next song."
2,so/so,aside from raspberry beret a classic and pop life a funky bass line the rest of the disc is second rate.
3,"Good, but...","...Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remaster and reissue this album with bonus tracks. Here's what should be:1. Around The World In A Day2. Paisley Park3. Condition Of The Heart4. Raspberry Beret5. Tambourine6. America7. Pop Life8. The Ladder9. Temptation10. 4 The Tears In Your Eyes11. Hello12. She's Always In My Hair13. Girl14. Raspberry Beret (12"" mix)15. Pop Life (12"" mix)16. America (12"" mix)"
2,"Big Prince fan...but, this one covered too much range","I had heard so much about this album for years and was hoping to prove wrong...I grant the creativity and attempts, but in a commercial environment, it disappointed compared to his others."
5,This album is so beautiful.,"I love Prince music. Some looked at this album as a step down from Purple Rain but that is complete b.s. It is more of a creative artistic move from Prince and The Revolution. My personal favorite track is The Ladder. The back up vocals are superb from Wendy, Lisa, Susannah, and Taja Sevelle. I love it."
4,Strong album for everyone,"I always wondered how Prince changed instruments used on this album, from the usage on Purple Rain. After it's success, only a few musicians are brave enough to make this. And Prince - as always - did it ! I think the second part of the album from Raspberry Beret is better than the songs before. Other good works are America ( the funkiest one on the CD ), The Ladder and Temptation, The Artist's most psychedelic song ever. I recommend this album for non-Prince fans too, because quite enjoyable and various in styles."
3,Around the World In a Day,I wished I would have been told I would not have the cover to my cd. Also the cd wasn't in that great of condition.
3,Coming around again,"On the upside, it sounds a little different from ""1999"" and ""Purple Rain""--most of the time. The downside is that it sounds like a fatally-flawed remake of Prince's earlier efforts. Where once he was wild, unpredictable, a visionary, here he sounds like a kid at the end of his rope who can still make some darn good tunes, since most of the songs on the record were better than anything else that was being released at the time, but who doesn't really know much about anything, except for his lover's tambourine (maybe). I mean, it sounds nice, but even the sound can't transcend hollow psychedelia. ""Pop Life"" has a nice groove, but it sounds more original than it is. The same could be said for the album."
2,Needs a Little Work,I have to say that I bought this album and really only liked one song. Really I think people should buy the purple rain album.It was a big hit and every song is great!
2,Weakest Rizwan Muazzam Album,"This is the weakest of the traditional Rizwan Muazzam albums. Firstly the recording quality is bad, it was recorded in pakistan and is extremely muted. The upper half of the frequency spectrum is completely absent.Nusrat fans will recognize song 1, which Nusrat called ""To Karimi"" which is on the ""final recordings"" album. The last song is the traditional ""Rang Hai Nai"". The rest are new Rizwan-Muazzam songs. There are seven songs on this cd, about 10 minutes each, which means they have to squeeze in the performances. This makes for lackluster performances of the songs here, not too much improvisation. The singers don't seem in improvising form during this recording.I'd recommend getting ""Sacrifice to Love"", for those who are just exploring this group."
2,The Pirates who didn't steal everything,"This CD was produced in England and is a pirated version of the original 2-disk vinyl set. While it has most of the material from the original, it's put together in the very slapdash way. If you can find the LP records (and still have a phonograph), you'll get a better sense of the live event."
3,Nice and Quick,Kenny really needs to tackle a Gospel CD like Randy Travis or Charlie Daniel did. They do standards with a spin. Thats what Kenny should do. He still has a great voice and his Christmas CD's are great so a real Gospel record would be fantastic. This CD is worth its money. There just are not enough songs and I would like to hear him do more of the standards that would showcase his great voice.
5,It's become tradition,"We've had our Advent Book for seven years. Opening it on December first every year has become tradition in our family - and one which our boys eagerly anticipate. It always seems to captivate our friends and neighbors, too, and has even become traditions in those homes where we've given them as gifts or when our friends have purchased their own copies. Thanks again, Stockmans!"
1,Let down,"After we purchased this book, we read one page each day with our kids. We were all shocked to find that when we opened the door for the seventh day of advent and read the text, Christ was born. Next year we will have to start reading the book on the 18th of December. Then when we open the doors, we will not be suprised to find Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus.I purchased this book based on the 2 other reader reviews and was let down. The quality of the book is good but the content and the order of it needs review."
2,Evokes unpleasant images of Thomas Kinkade art,"I bought the book for our young children on the basis of other customer reviews. It is a great idea - one set of doors a day, opening to text from Scripture - but the art work is embarrassing, and reminded us of second-rate art, Kinkade style. With so much great art in the Western canon done around the Annunciation and the Christmas and post-Christmas stories, it is a shame that the producers of this book didn't use some of those settings as backdrops for the text. The Christian faith has inspired some of the very greatest art, music, and literature and I want my children to see that the Scriptures and the faith we are raising them in, is capable of those heights of greatness."
5,A window to the advent season,"Our children (5 and 3) love this book, and look forward to it each night. This is a great way to usher in and celebrate the advent season with children!"
5,A special book,"This book has changed our lives and how we celebrate the season of Advent. We not only celebrate Christmas, now we celebrate Advent. I purchased this book about 5 years ago. We love it and I plan to give it to each of our 4 children as they start their families. I also give it as a Wedding gift."
5,"Excellent, worth the cost","Don't be dissauded by the fact that this book isn't sold by Amazon, as you'll see some of the ""New"" category books are signed and shipped by the authors themselves. This is what we purchased, and we have been very pleased. In fact, the impetus for this review was that we recently took the book back out again to read with our family for the Christmas season. It's an excellent book, both in content and construction.So if you're willing to invest in something of quality that your family can enjoy together each year, we heartily recommend this purchase."
4,golden girl,"I love hearing about Jessica Savitch, and what you didn't see when you saw her on TV. This book focuses more then half, on Networks, and broadcasting in general, following mostly NBC, but does include something about all the networks. I would rather have heard more about Jessica herself. If you have seen the movie with Ron Silver and Sela Ward, that pretty much sums up the portion of this book that is actually devoted to Savitch. Though she was admired for her aggressive role in the female aspect of tv journalism, you see first hand that she wasn't qualified to do half of what they asked her to do, and was simply a pretty face who read copy that was written by other people.I find her emotional issues very relatable (anorexia, drug addiction, abusive relationships.) She lived a long hard life in her short 36 years."
4,A great smart addition to certain foods,"Glad I got this stuff. Nothing bad for you, and you can use it creatively to spice up, or sweeten up many different foods. Tastes almost like the real thing."
2,Ehhh-not so special,I believe I am in the minority but this was disppointing. I am sure if you are cooking with it-it would be a different story but to use on toast or anyting topically-not so great.
1,Watch out for differences on the knifes!,"I wanted to have a 12 person set of flatware so I purchased one 55 pieces set and another 20 pieces set.When I unpacked the two sets, surprise! The knifes were different. The 8 set had heavy and cheap-looking knifes while the 4 set had knifes that are lightweight rounded cable and nice looking.Bottom line: I returned both sets right away and bought a Henckels set for the same price.So watch out before purchasing! They have changed their production method for a cheaper one and kept the same model name."
5,Oneida Amsterdam 53-piece set,I purchased this set to augment the set I received as a gift from my workplace. We love this pattern and we were glad to find more online. We received this pretty quickly.
2,Not the quality that was expected,"The product description was like new while the item was acceptable. Was expecting the jewel case of the CD to be perfect and intact while the item had a completely broken jewel case. It was probably just a fluke but out of the 4 CDs I received in the box, the only item that was damaged was that one CD from this seller. Amazon was great with understanding and provided a refund but I was still disappointed with the seller."
5,POWERFULL CD!!!,"Guilty Pleasures it's one of the most intensive Quiet Riot cd's,because the sound give it to you the Metal Helth line-up, the last cd for Sarzo and Cavazo. The first song ""Vicious circle"" sounds pretty good, ""Feed the machine"" it's one of the most powerfull songs of the band, and ""I can't make you love me"" it's a good ballad song. If you are a fan of the band, buy it. I hope Carlos Cavazo return to this band, his band."
2,"it has some good qualities, FM reception ain't among 'em","The FM reception is rediculously bad, so don't buy this if that is what you want. I use this mainly as a recorder from the radio, and it works pretty well, although I've had some problems when I try to move files onto by computer. Techinical support with this company--in my experience--is non-existent. The Ondio works as a recorder, but in other respects it falls short. I'm not about to buy another MP3 player, so I'll make this work for me. But if you buy one and have problems, you will be largely on your own with it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"After exchanging it TWICE, now having had 3 different copies of this player, i STILL can't get it to work. It freezes, won't hold as much memory as it says, turns off when it feels like it, and, as if its not working wasn't enough, the stupid case doesn't even fit! that should have tipped me off.it is small, and light, and looks really cute, but unless you want a $$$ FM radio, i'd buy something else. the battery life for mp3 playback isnt good either, but that shouldnt really matter because you cant really play mp3s anyway.Overall, don't bother with this product..."
3,"Good, but . . .","It's small, light, has good internal memory, and handles MP3s well. Sound quality is good, but is much improved by replacing with the headphones--pretty much any cheap set is a step up from the ones included. FM radio reception is terrible, although it can be marginally improved by tuning into one stop below the actual station. Included pouch is handy, but poor fit blocks some controls. Overall, apart from the poor radio reception which has been a nuisance, I've been happy with this player. But if you can wait for the second edition, do."
2,The archos ondio [is bad],This product has a lot of bugs to be worked out. If you do a bit more research you will quickly find out that many people are dissatisfied with it. Mine was defective out of the box and I sent it back. The customer support is also terrible.Do not buy this product unless you have a lot of money and enjoy collecting MP3 players.
2,"OK player, poor radio, marginal recorder","I bought this as a recording device, both for radio and by way of the accessory microphone. The MP3 encoding is inadequate, particularly at low volume levels. Lots of digital artifacts in the sound.Radio reception is poor, even for strong local stations. You won't want to record the radio if there's constant noise when you move around and change reception.Still, it is just about the smallest and lightest recorder I think you can find right now, which means it is more likely to get carried around than devices that weigh more.The microphone accessory (with a preamp) is pretty good, works when plugged into the line input of a laptop for very good quality recording. (Note: microphone accessory is a separate purchase).Another reviewer found that the controls were difficult to use because of the poor fitting case; I second that."
4,Not as bad as everyone else thinks...,"I have to say that I received this as a birthday gift from my husband, and I really like it. We had firmware issues at first but after he did an update it has been great. I don't think that it eats batteries anymore than any other MP3 player does. There are several quirks that used to annoy me, but I've learned to live with them. It's size is nice for working out with, but I do however wish that the ear plug cord was longer for the left ear. Other than that I have no big beef with it. I'd recommend it to a friend."
1,Great...For a while,I got this CD player for Christmas and couldn't wait to get out there and use it. I used here and there and I took it with on a vacation and I loved it. I didn't use it for a while then and tried to use it but it wouldn't turn on. I tried to turn it on and all it did was make a hissing noise. I was very upset that after a few uses it broke.
2,Underwhelming...,"The VP04 looks nicer than your average portable CD player, but it's a bit larger and bulkier than it should be. The biggest problems I have with this model are the skipping and sound quality. The skips are random and don't occur on the same tracks or CDs. They occur with standard audio as well as MP3 files -- all this while I'm sitting still. The various EQ settings are a joke. The remote really should have a hold switch and a volume control. The only true redeeming quality is the backlit display, which is hard to find on a portable CD player at any price. In any case, I returned the VP04 and spent an extra ten bucks on a comparable Sony, which is much better and it does NOT skip, even when I play the same CDs."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this player because it is supposed to play both mp3 and wma files. I have a HUGE wma collection so this sounded great to me. I've burned 8 different cd's with wma files and have not had much luck playing them back. The cd's work on my pc after they've been burned, but when I put them in the player, about 90% of the songs do not play. The player just skips right over track after track. I've tried differenct cd brands, sizes, burning methods, wma files, etc. All end up with the same results. I emailed Virgin for help but just received one of their witty responses that make you chuckle but don't solve anything in the end. The email was really just a summary of the stuff found in the manual.Bottom line - I bought it for playing wma files and it won't play them."
2,"Cute, and the price is right, but.......","When I saw this player in the store, and caught the MP3/WMA playback feature - I had to have it! It looks good, and the features seem to be there, but sadly it does not live up to my expectations.First of all, the included earbuds are horrible sounding. I would think Virgin could have included something a bit better without breaking the bank. If that were the only issue, I would be forgiving (as I simply switched to using a better set of headphones). However this player skips on regular CDs even when setting on a desk. Plus once in a while, you often hear a loud burst of sound between tracks. Plus, while maybe minor, I'd like to have had a volume control on the remote control.This player was a good idea that sadly does not live up to it's potential."
1,Won;t play CD-R MP3s,"I bought two of these units at Target and neither would sucessfully play MP3s burnt onto a CD-R. They would [play one or two songs and then the unit stopped working. I had to cycle the power to get it working again. This was maybe a bad batch, but obviously I'm not impressed. It played regular audio CDs fine. Display is backlit, but it's very dim."
2,In soccer You don't score 8-0,No matter what level of difficulty I put it on the game is way to easy. All you have to do is take a shot from the slightest angle and then the goalie will fly way left or right of the ball. It automatically goes in. NO FUN.
4,fun,"I am a huge soccer fan, and this is a great game. Yet I give it a four because at first, I thought it was a little difficult to understand how to work it but once i got the hang of it i couldn't put it down. They should make more soccer games for game -boys by the way i'm a girl."
1,Outdated material,"VERY outdated, the title is hype, it's not really much about advanced anything, just beginner information.I am glad I did not pay very much for this, it certainly is **NOT** worth the $40+ some sellers charge."
4,Excellent Guide for Director-level and Above,"PROS: This is an excellent, well-organized book for those who are negotiating positions at director-level or above. This truly makes it stand out in the category (I bought two other books and found this one to be far and away superior for my Director-level situation).CONS: The book could definitely be shorter and contain a larger number of practical examples and case studies, perhaps organized in a meaningful way.In short, this is a tremendous value. I strongly recommend it."
3,Good common sense negotiation tactics but...,"I bought this book hoping that it would give me some indication of what kinds of things I could ask for when negotiating a new job. I am not at the level of an executive that could be offered stock options and signing bonuses. But I do want to look out for myself. This book provided information that I found to be basic common sense for negotiation that was good, but it did not answer questions I have about what kinds of different ""benefits"" I could ask for, such as, car phone, portable laptop, telecommuting, etc. Also, what does a written offer look like? Samples would have been great."
2,This book wasn't for me,"Instead of getting useful information, all I read is the author bragging about how successful he was in salary negotiation. Since the author's specialty is on high-paying jobs, his experience is inapplicable to most of people."
1,There is only one Mediator...,"Stay away from any writing or anything pertainingto the Virgin Mary. She is a false mediator.""Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name [the LORD Jesus Christ]under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."" Acts 4:12""I am the way, the truth, and the life: No man cometh untothe Father, but by Me."" John 14:6"
5,A new look at a familiar character,"I just finished reading this book last night. I have purchased almost every book published on the life of Anne Frank and I learned a lot of new information on her father. I am not sure if I believe the author's theory on the betrayer, but it was interesting to read the new information. I would highly recommend this book if you are interested in the Anne Frank story."
2,Not as Advertised,"For my Halloween costume, I ordered this pirate eye patch and earring set. Instead of the plain black eye patch as advertised, I received one with the skull and crossbones with lots of red glitter. Red glitter outlines the skull, fills the eye sockets and borders the entire eye patch. This appears to be an eye patch for a lady pirate costume. I be disappointed. ...Yarrrr."
5,A band on the verge of eclipsing the sun,"Take all your CD's and burn them for in one single dynamic stroke Noxious Emotion has rewritten the history book of music. It's as if they have been possessed by the spirits of John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin and Bob Hope. Through their sensitive hands they weave masterpeace after masterpiece that instantly have a timeless quality to them whilst still retaining their edgy contemporary/street roots. This is a mark of a true creative genius at work. Sit back and feel their greatness, it will be the most awesome ride of your life. Are Noxious Emotion the progeny of God?, maybe. Have they changed the course of modern culture? Definitely. 'Hot Symbols' is the greatest CD ever recorded. FACT"
5,Some track names are incorrect,"I love Son House. I don't own this album, but if it's Son House I assume it's pretty awesome. You can disregard my star rating if you want, I just felt it necessary to point out that some of the track names are incorrect on this album. Track 3 in not called ""Judgement Day,"" it's probably House's most famous song ""Death Letter."" Track 4 is not called ""New York Central,"" it's ""New York State Express."" And track 5 is not ""A True Friend is Hard to Find,"" it's ""Grinnin' In Your Face.""I just felt I should write this review for the sake of accuracy.Thanks for reading"
2,not what you think,"This film is not what you think. It is not a documentary at all and does not tell a story despite its description. It is a piece of art, written mostly for the self-indulgence of the artist. It is disjointed; I learned nothing new and much of it was difficult to understand as some background poems and songs were spoken or sung in either Russian or Ukranian without translation. It is best described as poetry with some corresponding images, but not story telling. I was hoping for a second ""Chernobyl Heart"" and this is a far cry."
2,"""Artistic"" drivel","As close to being a pretentious ""Art House"" film as one can get. Nothing in this makes it worth seeing as a documentary about Chernobyl. There is no substantial information in this film about the disaster or people involved. The narration is done by various voice-over actors, and they overdo it by several orders of magnitude. On the plus side, the cinematography and editing show an extraordinarily high degree of skill and expertise throughout, but sadly it isn't enough to carry this documentary. Watch ""The Battle of Chernobyl"" instead."
1,Boring,It was not what I expected. Some parts were interesting but for the most part it didn't give to much info. It was only poetry and pictures of current. I wanted to hear more of what and how it happend.
4,Good student research film,This film was part of two students research for History Fair. They were able to get very good information and see some of the hardships that followed this catastrophe.
2,This Is Not a Documentary Film,"This has a very rough amount of information and is very abstract, only occasionally making any sense at all. Could have been done much better, turn off the sound and watch probably glean a lot more. A waste of time as it is."
2,Beware,"Beware! This album is only 33 minutes long! And the 2nd track, ""Shut Up"" is a pop number in that speedy-singing Jennifer Lopez-Destiny's Child vein -- horrors! Otherwise, some good salsa -- but way way WAY too short for the cost!!"
2,Tito sells out,"I honestly don't see what the big deal about this album is. I am appalled with the way salsa is headed: instead of actual instruments, they have syntesizers and electronic drumbeats. I always considered Tito Nieves a true salsero, but I think he made a big mistake in making this album. This album doesn't do him justice"
2,en otra onda,"ok, now this album is not good lol .. i think wea latina thought it would be a good idea to try to promote tito in a urban mainstream artist, whipped up half a album .. and released it to see what happened .. now the album only has 2 good songs .. and sometimes those songs grow old .. didn't like it"
1,salsero to a urban street singer ? What the hell is that,"I bought muy agrdecido and clase aparte and these album was incredible but for the love of god, what the hell is that borring album En otra onda??? Que vive la salsa dice Tito but where is the good salsa in this album as before ??? Don't understand why big salsero like tito did an album like that. Really disappointed. OJALA NO ES UNA MODA cause Tito va a decir que la salsa muere. Tradition Tito,"
2,Outdated,"This book is an outdated compilation of e-commerce JOURNAL articles related to the travel industry (circa 2002).Some of the articles may have once been useful, while others are poor studies by graduate students that have little relevence.I'm not sure how this book constitutes a ""handbook"". It has no direction, guidance or thesis."
2,Hopefully just a case of bad editing,"This book is surprisingly unhelpful. For those taking Danish as their first foreign language the book will be confusing; it will be frustrating for those who have several languages under their belt and are familiar with grammar. For example, the genitive case is introduced without a good explanation of what the genitive case is, or even explaining what a ""case"" is. The phonetics section is hopelessly confused; they use the same symbols for completely different sounds ([e] for the vowels in English 'sin' and French 'les'), and symbols that don't correspond at all to how my native Danish-speaking professor pronounces things. I'm going to check out the Comprehensive version from the library and hope that this book, as a pared-down version, merely suffers from bad editing."
3,Down tempo House music,"I was somewhat disappointed with this collection of House tracks from Bah Samba. There are a couple Brasilian flavored tracks, but beyond those there is nothing here that is very inspiring."
4,Great Docudrama,"I have most of the popular written and video publications on the advent of our nuclear weapon program. I would rate ""Hiroshima"" as the number one video docudrama, and this film a close second. It clearly eclipses the more available ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" in its authenticity. Dennehy's protrayal of Groves is highly credible based on the general's reputation, as is Strathairn's Oppenheimer. Highly recommended for student's of this interesting era of American military history."
4,"Great movie, terrible DVD transfer","The only copy I've had of this movie was a VHS tape of a heavily edited broadcast recorded years ago off of Japanese TV. I was happy that it's finally become available on DVD, but the transfer is bad, not much better than my old VHS copy. As far as the movie itself, it's the best treatment of the US side of the story, preferable to Fat Man and Little Boy, which suffers, like Midway, by including prominent fictional characters. Standouts in the cast are Brian Dennehy as a driven, fiercely intelligent Leslie Grove and David Strathairn as a sly, bemused, and, ultimately, tortured Robert Oppenheimer). Highly recommended."
5,Can't watch it often enough,"""Day One"" is the best treatment so far of an overarchingly important era in American history: the development of the Atomic bomb and its use against Japan. Brian Dennehy gives the performance of his career as Gen. Leslie Groves, the military head of the Manhattan Project, and is superbly supported by a cast including Hume Cronyn, Richard Dysart and Tony Shalhoub (memorable as Enrico Fermi). The drama is first-rate, the pace brisk, the dialog crisp and to the point. Even more important, the history is mostly accurate--a real achievement given the controversial nature of this material. Top notch!"
3,Nothing special,"This book had a good plot but it wasn't exactly carried out in the best way. Many times it was just jumpy and the events don't have allot of depth. It's like one of those bad Lifetime movies that you start watching and you know what's going to happen except you just watch for the hell of it. This is a book version of that. Nothing extraordinary about it, very average."
2,Kiss off,"While better than some of her other books, this one still comes up lacking something. Another good concept, but mediocre application. The time travel, vampire, witch story just never seemed to reach it's potential. The heroine is marginally less of a brainless ditz than the others written by this author but still manages to make some incrediably stupid moves. And it's another one of those ridiculous over the top ""pink bow"" endings. If you really want to read it, check your local library rather than putting out the cash."
2,Something missing,"Although I enjoy most all vampire books and will even read them from the romance section, this author writes in a style not often seen in the vampire genre. Its also not I style that appears to be common in the romance genre. Her heroines tend to be the simpering sort and the heroes can be almost as misogynistic or at least overbearing as the villains. There is no spunkiness or quick whitted humor."
5,Night Series.... best from Amanda Ashley,"I love all of Amanda Ashley's books, but I think that the ""Night"" books are by far the best. Roshaun and Brenna start the series off with their story. You'll fall in love with them and want to read about the rest of their family in the following books: Night's Touch, Night's Master, and Night's Pleasure."
1,"Of all the Corner of the Earth singles, this is the last worth getting",This single in a way shows how much Jamiroquai has diverged from its funk roots. The 2 live songs Bad Girls (with Anastasia) and Titan are more like electro dance songs than anything resembling Jamiroquai. you do not even get the Mondo Grosso version of Love Foolosophy on this single. And the multimedia is just a bunch of video clips (not full videos) which add nothing to this poor release.Do yourself a favour and buy the COTE single with the Mein Vain remixes on it for some great songs.
3,"Good, but not as good as the first time.","Don't get this expecting something on the same level as ""San Antonio Rose."" This is fantastic music, but not nearly as good as their first offering.Willie is in fantastic voice here. He definately redeems himself after ""Beer For My Horses.""Ray Price is in excellent voice.This is an excellent swing record, and ten times better than the best stuff coming out of Nashville these days. But, But, But, please don't get this hoping for something as good as ""San Antonio Rose."""
4,"the way it was, and is","If this isn't a great album, it's something just as worthy: a good, solid, sturdy one. Two pros do what they do best, Texas honkytonk shuffles, sad songs of faded love, and stripped-down Western swing. Willie Nelson and Ray Price are the masters of this variety of grown-up music. Price's presence is a particular treat. He records less often than Nelson does, and if he isn't as wildly experimental, he is a dependable exponent of a nearly lost kind of country music. You can't fake these very fine, unsparing songs, in which no falsehood or sentimentality is to be discerned. You have to have lived these stories, and no young, callow hunk with a big cowboy hat and an obnoxiously loud, soulless band could even try. And is there a truer song -- in any genre -- than the late Floyd Tillman's ""This Cold War with You""?"
2,I Honestly Done Recomend,"There are few parts that are very nice. Unfortunatly, much like the string tribute, KoRn Is not very flattering on instruments without the members and their instruments. It unfortunatly just is to ugly sounding, the following reason are what really stand in the way:1: Not a really Piano Player. This has no qualities of human playing. It is obviously MIDI with a mediocre piano sample.2: The sample used for the piano is way to bright and does not fit with the chords.3: There is a very heavy reverb on the Piano that out shadows any meledy.4: The songs are only slightly recognizable.Really this is a weak effort, partly due to the cheap sounding sampled MIDI piano, and the lack of any humanistic traits, but the real downfall lies in the concept; KoRn just does not sound good on Piano. Thier beutiful ugliness of korns work cannot be realized via the piano."
2,Paperart: The Art of sculpting paper/ Michael G. Lafosse,"I bought this book based on the reveiw given by Hamsterdance. While it is a beautiful book to look at, it does not actually provide all the steps needed to take you from the beginning of a project all the way through the end. Partial explanations are given about how the artists does this or that. Other then oragami, neither graphic, nor explanitory descriptive is given in how paper is actually sculpted,casted etc.. If you want a coffee table book, this is it. If you want to learn how to sculp, or cast paper, keep looking."
5,"Beatiful Galleries, Varitey of projects","This is a wonderful book filled with over 15 projects including folded paper (origami), assembled paper (paper sculpture) and art created with paper pulp. Beautiful and inspirational galleries after each project show you more advanced artwork using similar techniques and opening your eyes to endless possibilities.Each project includes a materials list and is demonstrated step by step with photos and sometimes illustrations. Helpful tips for each are also included. Though the instructions are good, there are no templates and some artistic talent or experience is necessary for many of the projects. My favorite projects include a washi doll, twisted paper box, and a pulp painting.In the back there is a nice list of suppliers and websites as well as a few organizations and educational programs. There is also a directory of artists with contact information. If you want a sampling of the paper art or just need inspiration this is the book to get."
4,A must for any hard-core steely-dan fan,"This is the definitive collection of pre-Steely-Dan demos by Becker and Fagen. Some of these demos were, years later, turned into actual Steely Dan studio releases (like Caves of Altamira - but the demo has an extra verse!), others didn't fit in with the Steely Dan image and were never released. Since these are demos from the late 60's/early 70's, the audio quality is very limited, but acceptable for true fans who are interested in the pre-history of Steely Dan."
2,A Ponderous Ache,"On their two full length CDs and handful of E.P.s, Pedro the Lion have fully explored life through the prism of a flexible, humanistic Christianity. Singer-guitarist-songwriter David Bazan has never let dogma contaminate his artistic empathy; there's nothing haranguing about his love of Jesus. Nothing has changed with Progress. The songs are solid. Yet on the heels of Winners Never Quit earlier this year, these four tunes showcase a melancholy that borders monotony. Bazan's voice, pleasant as it is, has a ponderous ache. He needs lighter settings than those he's given himself here, or more uptempo tracks to vary the pace."
1,Broke after two days,I bought a cell phone holster and within two days it broke. It was complete garbage and there was no way I could possibly fix the problem
2,Doesn't hold up,"The colander is attractive, and if used as a fruit bowl or only occasionally it's probably fine. But using it to cook with on a near-daily basis, it's gotten rusty and the enamel has worn off around many of the holes. The pattern of drainholes is also not 100% ideal (would work better if there were drainholes closer to the bottom on the sides)."
1,junk,these are the junkists nails. They were all broken up in the box and you can buy the nails for 1/2 the price any where. The plastic holding them together is lite weight and just junk.
2,Annoyed!,"Be aware that this product does not come as advertised. Nails measure only 3 3/8"" including the head - and that's being generous! If they are 16D shorts, at least the packaging/advertising should say as much. It didn't!"
2,Not very pleased from day 1 ...,This phone started having problems from the first day we bought it. (We should have held on to our receipt and returned it right away in retrospect).When going hands-free it would sometimes hang-up and the quality of the answering machine (understanding the person's message) was poor and never seemed loud enough.Recently (and we purchased it about 1-2 years ago) the #4 on the key pad started sticking badly and a few days ago it started not hanging-up when it was supposed to and our phone was consequently off the hook and we didn't know it.It was a pleasure throwing it away last night and now I am on the hunt for a truly great cordless phone!
2,Just not my thing this time,"I've read similar books, but this one just didn't keep my interest. A few quirky stories but the rest was ho-hum."
3,Hit and miss (but mostly hit) collection for Mental Floss fans,"Einstein's Refrigerator is a collection of strange but true stories. The book is divided into chapters with different themes, such as ""You've Got to Be Kidding"" (almost unbelievable tales), ""Inventive Genius"" (the strange origins of kitty litter, the zipper, and other common items) and ""Unbelievable!"" (which seems to be ""You've Got to be Kidding"" take two.)Many of the stories such as ""Ballooning,"" in which a man ties helium balloons to his lawn chair and sets out on a high-altitude journey, are LOL funny. Others such as ""Mike, the Headless Chicken"" are just creepy. A few of the stories go on a bit too long or were not odd enough to hold my interest, but overall this is an entertaining collection. The author lists multiple sources for each story, which shows that truth can be stranger than fiction!Anyone who enjoys Mental Floss magazine will like this book as well."
2,Meh!,"Interesting stories, I read the first few. This book should have stayed a blog, thats what it basically is, a compilation of blog posts."
2,"May be educational, but ...","This book may be educational but it is not that funny, and certainly not ""spellbinding"". I may have been put off by its old-fashioned writing style. The stories made the Web site they were first published on successful, it does not seem to me to justify a book."
1,A total waste of time,"Stupid me! I was completely hoodwinked by the title. I expected something more cerebral and at least related to Albert Einstein. Neither was the case. Fortunately, it only cost $1 as a promotion. The time wasted reading the first few anecdotes was far more costly. Don't bother!"
2,not science really,"Somewhat intersting stories, not sure how accurate they are, the writing style is so so, full of cliches, not really science related. I'm a science teacher looking for ideas, but I read the first 4 stories, and none of them really dealt with science topics. Hey what the heck, it's free!"
2,Was this edited?,"A collection of things I already knew in easy to use, bathroom-ready form. More than any book since Mick Foley's first, this one could really use an editor. The references section was usefull, however."
3,Fun and Free!,"This is something that was fun, but I wouldn't have paid for it. There are very interesting facts and stories, but there are also some boring ones. The good thing is you can skip over the uninteresting parts."
3,enough already!,"Although the individual stories were educational and entertaining - I couldn't stomach the ending of each chapter. If I had to read that sentence one more time I think I would have thrown the book across the room (of course I wouldn't, since I read it on my Kindle). I also wasn't that thrilled with the writer's style - it seemed like the attempt at humor seen in high school student's essays."
4,Great book to think about.,"This book is a collection of mini books and are part of other series, too. most of the stories are good. It is a quick read and quite entertaining."
4,Enjoyable,There are a lot of interesting facts to read and learn. Some were heard of but never learned the details. Enjoyable and educational.
3,needed something light,"I was tired and needed something light. This book is hokey and reads like a web page out of the 90s... oh wait, that's what it is. But it was fine and some of the stories are mildly interesting."
2,Meh.,"This is a collection of website/blog entries about interesting facts. Something you might see as a column in Reader's Digest or the Farmer's Almanac. While they are all written well, it doesn't seem to be worth the money I put in. Time, yes, but not money."
2,Bad writing at best,"I just finished ""Einstein's Refrigerator"" by Steve Silverman. While I found many of the stories interesting, over all, the book was poorly written. The author fancies himself a comedian, and inserts (way too many) parenthetical phrases throughout the book, thinking he is being funny, when in reality, he is showing the reader what a poor writer he is. Thank goodness it was free, and mercifully short."
2,Childish and boring,"Was Silverman trying to be another Paul Harvey?This seems to be written for teens or younger. The chapters answer questions such as ""Was there really a chicken who lived without a head?"", and ""How was Kitty Litter discovered?"" or ""How was the zipper invented?"". Each chapter ends with the author asking the question ""Useless? Useful? I'll leave that for you to decide.""The question should be ""Interesting? Not interesting?"", etc. The answer is mostly, unfortunately, not interesting. The writing is childish with more than required parenthetical remarks that seem to be asides written to a preteen. I read the chapter from which the title was derived, ""Einstein's Refrigerator"", and wondered why it was even in the book. There were no great secrets, nothing to stimulate you or make you say ""Wow, thats' interesting"".I struggled to make it half way through before I realized it was getting worse, not better.Paul Harvey's reputation has nothing to fear and, now you know the rest of the story."
5,Entertaining and educational,"Loved the quirky things in this books. I'm a teacher so I plan to list this as one of my favorite summer reads with my students! If you love trivia that is pretty much useless, this is a book for you (and I use it all the time with students...)"
4,Joe Tex,"Joe Tex Is A Great Singer And This Collection Shows It. The Sound Is Great And You Get A Lot OF Music. The Only Problem Is They Left off The Song ""You Said A Bad Word"" Which I Find On Most Of His Greatest Hits Albums. Also ""Loose Caboose"" Is Not 7 Minutes Long They Shortened It To 3 Minutes And 49 Seconds. Other Than That These CD's Really Rock."
3,Good but a little disapointed,I had heard excellent reviews of Joe Friel's work and of this book specifically and overall I am disapointed with it. While Dr. Friel does offer good information there certainly were not any great new revelations found in the book. While I did pick up a few good pointers there was nothing that would completely change my training programe.
1,I had hoped for more,"A long winded book that should have been 1/2 as long based on the content.Unless you are able to stumble through the verbage, leading to new term after new term then I'd skip it."
4,Good for serious training,"I'm new to serious cycling and bought this book along with Bernard Hinault's Road Racing. the Hinault book though somewhat dated (1986) is better for a beginner as it discusses the fundamentals in a more accessible way. Friel's book is much bigger and targeted more towards a serious racer with charts on training regimen and so on. Even then, it is a book that a beginner would find useful as it covers a lot of the stuff that Hinault covers such as training zones, nutrition and so on."
2,"Not a Bible at all, very specialized","I expected a training book to get me from a beginner to a good cyclist. This book is to take you from a good cyclist to a racer. This should have racing in the title. The book is useless for beginners who just want to complete a century while working and having a family, in other words real people."
5,It really IS the Training Bible,"The Ultimate resource for understanding the training cycle - especially the relationship of how rest and the timing of recovery week actually form the basis for the BUILD phases and why you really should rest and recover so you can come back stronger. But, hey, if I'm racing you, go ride hard every day and don't waste your time reading this!"
4,The Cyclist's Training Bible,I have really enjoyed this book. It has a lot information for people just starting out or who have been riding for awhile.
4,Excellent Learn How to Do!,"Very complex, very detailed oriented. Very good for teaching us how do feature our own training."
4,Complicated But Workable,"I read this book twice and nearly gave up on it several times. I repeatedly found the complexity as befuddling as I did amusing. Not only is the program complicated, so is the book.But I still recommend it.In order to create a program, I sat down in earnest with a stack of post-its. For everyone's benefit, these are the pages that you need to mark:pp 47-49pp 144-147pp 300-307Forget the templates. Just create your own Excel sheet for the training diary. I decided not to follow his strength training guideline (more complexity, too much upper body)."
4,Im a novice and it is working for me,"It is nice to get know the principles and main factors that can improve my riding. So since the first few pages I was pretty please with the book. Althoug is a bit advanced for me, in every page I find something that suit my needs and definitly a lot of information to be consider in the future."
5,"Informative, must have for serious cyclists",I purchased this for my teenage cycling son. It is very informative and helpful for any serious cycling enthusiast. I would highly recommend this book.
3,Many better books out there,"I was certainly disappointed with this book relative to others that I have read relating to either cycling or running. I hate to give negative reviews, but to add balance to the others, I make an exception. Overall the book did not appear to be well organized or very deep in technicalities. The section on heart rate monitoring was weak at best. Very little detail or depth is provided regarding physiological effects of the various elements of training. Probably the strongest element of the book is its aid in setting up a program/training schedule and emphasis of periodization. This alone may be sufficient reason for the purchase of this book."
2,VIRGIN PULSE 10.4 Inch LCD/DVD,"Checked this out as thought it would work well in home as well as car and the price was right. This product probably has the worst picture I have seen in a Lcd. Could not see a good picture at any angle, if you went one degree one way or the other, it would get blurry. Took it back after 2 minutes of use. I do give it two stars for fair value and decent audio."
5,Written with Passion,"I have read. Manhattan Memories, The many Faces of Passion, and most recently, Brimmed Hat With Flowers. Carmen has a wonderful way with words. From the moment you pick up her books, you are transported by her passion and talent. I highly recommend that everyone feast their mind and soul with her work. Jean Premeau"
5,An Amazing book,"Carmen M. Pursifull has created the best original book of poetry since Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"". Carmen rockets into the new millenium with a mastery of imagery not felt since Ginesburg. Brimmed Hat With Flowers shows a true artist who is capable of expressing the deepest of emotions. Her unique voice will take you on a journey that will sometimes lift, sometimes cajole, sometimes wring at your innermost feelings. Carmen is capable of expressing desire and passion at a level I have not experienced before. This book is sultry, sexual, and yet tender. Carmen is an American treasure. The multi-layered poems afford the reader a fresh new perspective from a master of symbolism and imagery."
5,Brimmed Hat with Flowers,"Carmen Pursifull painted a masterpiece with Brimmed Hat with Flowers. Every sentence, every phrase conjured an image so strong you are caught up and cannot let go. So subtle and the words tickle you hours after. So sensual and heady you can taste them. I recommend this book, not only for people who enjoy poetry, but for people who enjoy words."
3,Messy.....,"I've been doing my own bikini waxing for years in Argentina. As I'm spending some time in the US, I figured I could still do it, and avoid the expensive salons.I think the main problem is the wax itself.... the texture seems like glue, and it's really difficult to remove it.I've read another reviews and apparently the secret is to use some baby powder... Another secret: use a really thin layer.The heater is great, so maybe the best is to just buy the heater and get the wax somewhere else."
2,Bad Wax,"For starters the kit is missing some baby powder, and something to take off the wax, I personally use baby oil. The warmer is neat though, but the wax gave me a lot of problems. Everything went fine until a week after waxing. I got a terrible rash that started in the middle of the day and kept me up most of the night. The next morning the itching had stopped but I had bright red bumps almost everywhere, and didn't fade until the end of the day, but I still had little scars. I used all sorts of creams and lotions to stop the irritation and the itching, and it would only stop for a couple of minutes. A couple of days later they faded, but still, that had never happened before with other waxes I have used."
1,Dissatified Customer,"This product was so bad. The wax was stuck to the lid. It was very hard to remove. Once applying the wax, and removing with the muslin sheets, muslin particles adhered to my face. Cache would not accept my return and sent it back saying it needed an RMA #. The supposedly sent an email on November 23, which I did not received. Anyone dealing with Cache, please don't. If you are dissatisfied with the product, the only way to return it is unopened. How do you know what the product is like if you do not open the box and try it. I am having this investigated. I am really disgusted with this company. Do not purchase anything unless you intend to keep it."
1,very poooorrr,it came with the plastic cap in two pieces...very poor equipment....dont like the wax that comes with it....dont like this product at all....i willl just put it in the garbage....
2,Not happy with the product!,"The wax did not get all the hair off. I had to wax several times in one spot to get all the hair, which left bruises. I do not recommend at home waxing."
1,Sensitine skin? horribllllleeee,"This product sucks ! I thought I would give it a shot and try this out and review it but this product dried out my skin and pulled it, the wax wasnt even hot to start. I dont know if this item was defective but it sucks I would not recommend and it didnt even pull the hairs. I would rather use nairs microwavable wax tub"
3,Practice MIGHT Get to Perfect!!,"I'm neutral with this review. It's probably a good product, but I'm still learning the fundamental of doing my own eyebrows. I wanted to do my own eyebrows after paying folks $8 to do them at salons. I wonder how this kit compares to a professional salon kit? The glue was very sticky, but I'm not sure if it was getting hot enough. I'm concern that I'l run out of cloths and sticks from just learning. This process can create a real mess. All solutions with the kit are real NICE!! I'll keep trying to use this kit, but have plenty of time work this..."
3,The resting bars!,"I have read almost all of these reviews and have yet to find anyone responding as to how these resting bars are used??? Can someone out there who has figured it out, give me a clue. I also find it ridiculous that it claims to be a (KIT) and yet in order to use it you have to go out and purchase the powder and oil in order to even start."
2,Gigi wax warmer kit,The wax warmer works well. However I did not receive the PreHon lotion with my kit. Otherwise it was all it was advertised to be.
2,Not very good,The wax cream is awful and messy.I would not recommend this to anyone. It takes a long time to heat up as well. Alot of work for just trying to wax your eyebrows.
2,Cheap Wax,"I purchased this item to save on waxing, the wax itself is poor. The strips don't remove all wax. The warmer & skin products are great, however I purchased a different wax & strips. Should have just bought the warmer."
4,Totally worth it ...,"I used this product for the first time and I loved it. It's the best option to save money, if you visit spas to get your hair removed. I agree it does help if you have extra hands but anyone can easily manage hair removing. If you follow what the CD says exactly! I am happy that I got my money worth."
3,Overall O.K.,"I bought this for my gf so she wouldn't have to spend so much money at a salon.FIRST OFF: We DIDN'T get everything that this kit is suppose to come with. The collars weren't in the kit, neither were the smaller set of muslin strips.SECOND: The creme wax wasn't great. It's sticky, messy and ""for sensitive skin"" is not the greatest. However all skin types are different. It worked fine for her but on me was not at all pleasing.Other than these two factors, this set would have been great! My gf loves everything else about it. She loves the warmer and says it's a nice starter kit."
3,eh,i have coarse hair and the wax that comes with it doesnt do well with that. the wax paper is thin and you can feel the wax seeping through. it heats up pretty quickly though. and it has a lot of stuff for before and after waxing.
4,Absolutely worth the price,Heats well (about 30 min to temp). I would prefer less bottled product and more applicators in the set. I'm new to this type of wax so I'm still getting used to it but the machine it's self has been exactly what I was looking for.
4,Great kit for the price,"Not enough fabric comes with the kit, it ran out too soon, but the wax and product is amazing. Love it, and will save a ton of money over the years by not paying others to do the waxing."
4,At home wax kit,It's a great starter kit has everything good price. Love the lavender cream wax instead of the sticky Gigi honee it's more gental on the skin less bumps and breakouts
4,"Good kit, bad wax?","I think the value is there - warmer, sticks, strips, lots of creams and a jar of wax. I followed instructions and on several attempts I would pull the strip and the wax would remain on the skin while the strip painfully pulled up with only half the wax but no hair. This created several bruises and raw skin. This has happened both times I have waxed my lip - but only on one side. This has also happened on several spots when I waxed my arm. I think I will try honey wax. That being said, I love being able to wax at home so hopefully with a good wax and maybe figuring out a better technique, it will work out well."
5,I wish I had purchased earlier,"I'm so happy I bought this. I was sick of paying $20 every two weeks to go to the salon. Now I wax my eyebrows and upper lip at home and can do it as often as I want. After reading the reviews of the creme wax that it comes with, I decided to buy the all purpose honee and used that instead."
3,"Good warmer, bad wax","I very much like the warmer, but the wax is just rotten. Plus it doesn't come with the wax-off which is sorely needed with it!"
4,Gigi mini professional kit: very Satisfied,"I like the warmer, the creme wax and all small lotion bottles. Only thing that I didn't like is the ""cloth strips"" included in the kit. Each cloth has ""too many"" small threads which creates mess and hard to clean too. :("
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this after I moved to a tiny town with no esthetician in site. I needed to do my eyebrows mainly. I have tried this kit two times now and each time the wax does NOT even remove ONE DARN HAIR...not one! I am so mad I spent 50 bucks on this!
4,Great product. Salon quality results.,This wax kit has everything you need to get the job done. You really get your money back after just a couple uses.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DOESN'T WORK.,"I bought this to avoid having to spend the money on lip waxing and eyebrow waxing every few weeks. It was a 45 dollar mistake. I can never get any hair off, and end up tweezing. To make matters worse, I am stuff with bright red waxing marks on my face for an hour, and I didn't even wax any hair!!! DON'T BUY THIS! The creme wax does nothing. You need regular wax!!! Keep looking!!!!!!!! Don't waste your money!!!"
5,Very useful,"I am not pro at waxing. I've been getting waxed for at least 10 years and been using the strips for my upper-lips etc. So i have an idea how it's done. I finally decided to cut down the wax cost and ordered this. My set arrived pretty quickly and i had a chance to try it this weekend. It s super convenient. My wax was ready in about 20 mins. Yes it is sticky, but its wax and should be sticky. The lotions they gave for after wax wasn't able to clean up what's left on my legs so i had to use baby oil. And i totally recommend using oil to clean up as its super easy."
3,Good Deal; Dissappointing Results,"I bought the GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit as a starter for my at-home waxing alternative to paying the big bucks at the salon. The kit offered a lot of product at a good deal money-wise. I got all of the basic necessities: wax, wax warmer, spatulas, and then some. However, when I used the products as recommended, it only broke the hair off--leaving stubble. The kit comes with soft wax for sensitive skin, so maybe that wax wasn't right for what I was doing. Overall, I was impressed by the deal but dissappointed by its use."
4,Satisfied,This kit has almost everything you will need to start waxing at home. I used baby powder as dusting powder. I wish they had included wax-off instead of the other lotions and gels
4,it works,system worked well but did not include the wax remover - don't forget this if you buy this system
4,Sticky yet satisfying,"This ""pink"" type of wax included in the kit works best when heated to a lower temperature. It is generally a very sticky, stringy wax and if you don't hold your skin tight and pull fast when removing the strips, it wont pull off clean, but might leave residue and won't remove all the hair. Working in small areas works best. The wax tends to be more stringy when you try to get a large area at once. The kit does not come with body/skin wax remover which is really annoying, so make sure you order some in addition to the kit. Overall, the kit does what it is designed to do and is easy to use if you can deal with the mess. I would suggest an eppilator to those who are looking for a less messy method of hair removal."
2,Ok but very old fashioned,"Fits fine, but my husband said I look like my Grannie as the style of patter is dated, will wear as I have nothing else and I don't like wasting money"
4,No ordinary spy game.,"""Totally Spies"" for the Game Boy Advance is quite a marvel. You play as either Sam, Clover, Alex, or a super cool spy vehicle and solve some fascinating cases just like in the TV show.Basically, this is a game composed of mini-games that require fast and/or tactical button pressing on your game system. Once you've finished a level, you can take a look at some neat art pics used in that level. And if you're really up for a challenge, search each level thoroughly for hidden icons that give you codes you can punch in at the ""Totally Spies"" website. Neat.So I'm sure this game can be quite fun. Of course you can also watch the new episodes of the show currently airing on the Cartoon Network."
1,don't bother for non-eclipse users,"The recipies in this book assumes you are using the Eclipse environment. There are lots of screen shots of Eclipse user interface. Now if you are not an Eclipse user but simply want to learn Axis, this book is absolutely the wrong choice for you.The secret to learning Apache Axis is to read its user manual."
1,Light on details and organization,"This book may be useful to someone with no background in web services, Axis, SOAP, or developing software. It is structured as a walk through of implementing a specific example in a very specific way using very specific tools. It is very light on background information and is not useful as a reference.If you don't know how to get from step 0 to step 1, this book may be for you. If you are already at step 1, it probably isn't a good choice."
4,More Vanilla please,This OK. I was surprised it was not as rich as other Twinings teas that I would go out of my way to buy it again. I have a few boxes of it so it will last me. The vanillia is not too strong which some might like but I could use a little more. I have had similar Vanilla flavored teas off the shelf at the same level. I hoped for something different with Twinnings.
2,Strange smell and taste...,"I love black tea/vanilla, but I thought this tea had a very artificial smell/taste."
2,OK black tea - no real vanilla flavor though,"I bought this because it said it was vanilla tea - but the vanilla flavor is not discernable. Not a bad tea though, like some other vanilla wannabes. Try Mighty Leaf Vanilla tea if you like vanilla."
5,Excellent career guide,"I recommend this book to everyone - it's a tremendous resource for direction for someone just beginning in the job market, and an excellent refresher if you're thinking of a career change. It would make a great gift for the recent graduate!"
2,I wasn't looking for Jesus' help,"So this work really bummed me out. The non-religious content is extensive, but I've lost interest in the text after the Bible lessons."
4,Very Handy,"This notebook dictionary is incredibly handy for all students, or anyone who regularly needs a dictionary. It has three ring holes, and fits easily and is quite slim. My only complaint is that there are ALOT of words not included. I understand that to keep it slim you can't have as many words, but it lacks many (and includes alot that seem unnecessary) words i've needed to look up."
4,Fantastic Customer Service,"Bought the unit, plugged it in and it worked great. It kept the ice from forming in the pond and my stream running through cold weather. The unit stopped working and a coil melted through the plastic. Customer service (800-277-8401) was called and they express shipped a new unit. Very friendly, great service. Hopefully the second unit will not fail.Would recommend."
4,Worked great for 2 years,"I love this pond heater. It worked great for 2 years, then just stopped working for no obvious reason and ended up being frozen solid in the ice for a couple months.I liked it so much that I bought another, but if this one doesn't last more than 2 years, then I will switch brands."
2,worked good for one year,"I bought and used this item in my 370 gallon pond 4 months out of a year and it worked great,but the second year of use it did not work,I did nothing different from the first to the second year and handled and put it away in it original box during storage.I did the direction thing about putting it in a freezer to reset a thermostat,which it did work for a short time but froze itself in the pond ice,so unless you like spending money annually for a fairly decent deicer when it works or did work is up to you.Myself i am trying something else and hopefully lasting for more than a year."
2,Doesn't really open much space,"I was not quite sure to expect, so maybe my expectations were different from what should have been, but this product does not really open much of a space on the surface, it barely is an inch larger than the product itself. I am told it is plenty to keep the fish healthy and safe, but I am skeptical. I am careful to keep the waterfall fully operational and the fish seem okay."
1,Frustrated and Disappointed!,"I have to agree with everyone else who has written a review -- it works great for one season and then fails to work the second. I have owned two of these units. The first worked for a winter, then stopped working. I sent it back and the company sent me a new one. I used the second one last winter and it was fine. I plugged it in today (it's 20 degrees today and I NEED it to work) and it shorted out. So now I'm looking for another heater and, trust me, I won't be buying another one of these!"
2,Failed twice due to water getting inside,"I bought this unit as it was exactly what I needed for my pond. It worked great the first year. Luckily I was able to have Farm Innovators replace it under warranty as it was just within the 1 year period. Again, same thing, the replacement unit worked great the first year but some how got water in it(like the first one), now it melted through the bottom of the unit and is useless. I did not submerge the unit as it floats on top of the water but it appears that the seal around the plug cord going into the unit is poor and lets water seep in....luckily I have a small pump circulating the water that keeps a small opening in the ice so the fish are still swimming. I have to look for different unit for the real cold weather, what a disappointment."
1,Heating element melted through plastic,"I have a 1500 gallon koi pond next to my house. I used this heater the first year for about 4-5 months with no problems. The second year, the heating element inside melted through the plastic and allowed water to fill the inside making it sink to the bottom of the pond."
2,Worked for a little while,"I bought this to prevent my koi pond from freezing over totally. I followed directions to the T and it did work for a couple of weeks and then I noticed it was floating funny. It had burned a hole from the inside - out on the bottom, and now I dont' know if my fish will be electrocuted if I use it again."
1,Working great so far!,"Have had since October,2009, here in Pittsburgh. In a 100 gallon pond, no ice whatsoever even after a week of 5 degree nights. So far so good.Update: Was full of water by spring 2010, not working, totally worthless, don't buy."
4,Casio Men's A168W-1 Digital Watch,I bought two of these watches as gifts for my grand sons and they liked them.I thought they were attractive and the low price was great. Time will tell how well the perform.Thankyou.
5,Excellent watch.,I received this watch promptly. I've used casio watches for years and must reorder them when the buttons stop working. excellent watch.
4,A Good Basic Digital Watch,I had a watch very similar to this one a few years ago. I don't recall what happened to it. This one is a good buy for the money.Features I Like:1. The band is a perfect fit2. It has a 24 hour clock3. Resists water until the battery is changed (That was true of my former watch)4. The backlighting is bright. Can read it in the dark5. Looks goodFeatures I don't like1. Alarm is barely audible
5,Absolute value for money,"I was using a Casio A158W-1 for the past 4 years (In fact it was a look alike bought for $2). Amazed at the clean, neat and simple design of the watch with a superb easily readable display, I had decided to buy an original one.The watch has a good finish, better than my earlier look alike for obvious reasons. The strap is extremely easy to adjust.Basic functions like hourly chime, stop watch is included.The reason I chose A168W over A158W was the back-light. Unlike 158 which has a small LED on the left hand side of the display, this one has got a display which lit completely from the back. The soft blue light looks Uber cool.And the watch design is classic .... evergreen!"
5,Cassio A168W-1,"It is the third one I have had over many years. It is simple to operate, accurate & comfortible to wear, as well as being pretty cheap! I drive a School Bus so I use it for finding times between stops & general route timing.It's great & I highly reccomend it!!"
1,Poor design of the band clasp.,"The watch band is a nightmare to put on, the ad pictured a different type of clasp. The picture was very decieving."
5,Glad to have my old watch back,"I had one of these watches for about 15 years but it finally died about 5 years ago. I got it when they first came out. I've been using expensive ones and cheap ones ever since but I've always wanted one like I had but could never find one in stores. I finally found this online and it's like I have my old watch back again. Nothing has really changed since my first one; just a simple watch that shows everything you need to know at one glance. No buttons to push to switch from time to date. Nice band, not a cheap plastic one, and an easy to read display. Best watch around for the money."
5,"Best minimalist watch, and for a budget price too.","This watch is attractive, easy to use, and very durable. For the price, this watch is unbeatable. I wouldn't trade this watch for a product ten times as valuable."
2,lo peor de fito,"esto es lo peor de fito,aunque te encante fito, este disco se te va a hacer muy dificil de escuchar.comprate otro, como ""giros"" o ""el amor despues del amor"""
1,Decepción,"Fito desde ""Circo Beat"" empezó una carrera descendente. Aunque ése album, e incluso ""Abre"" tiene un par de cosas notables, se ha notado una fuerte baja en la calidad. En éste último disco, es más clara esa decadencia."
5,A Life Changer,"The best description of Uncle Tupelo I ever heard was ""Husker Du fronted by Hank Williams, Sr."" That pretty much sums it up. This album opened my (then) 19-year-old punk-rock ears to country music for the first time. A life-changing album in the truest sense of the word. It captures the true spirit of both genres and makes something powerful, beautiful, and unique. A must for any fan of either genre."
5,look's like were all lookin' for a life worth livin,"Every album that this band has released is wonderful but this album has songs that could make you laugh, make you dance, and make you cry. It is almost beyond words for me."
5,"""No Depression"" music doesn't sound like this...","This is the album that started the alt.country / ""No Depression"" movement?!?! When I first heard it, I thought it was a punk rock record (or as close as the 90s could get to punk). So what that they sported a Midwestern drawl and played acoustic guitar on a song or two. This thing rocks. It rocks hard. It rocks good. It rocks emotionally. It rocks with depression. It rocks with unemployment. And yes, it rocks right out the screen door and into the world. All music should be this good."
2,An attempt to sell folky sounds to teenage grungers.,"There's plenty of great alt country/ folk bands out there but this lot are very overrated. This may well be the only way to get young metal/ grunge heads to listen to any sort of countrified sound but I'm not buying into it. Jay Farrar has a great voice and is capable of pretty emotional stuff, like the second track 'That Year'. The majority of this LP is drab country grunge though."
2,"Big Raven Fan, but this stinks!","I am the BIGGEST Raven-Symone fan. But this CD is so cheap. I've heard that the bonus videos are on YouTube, so when you put this CD in the computer a site opens up. BOOTLEG! Raven is soooo far away from this. It doesnt even support her, so why buy it? Go buy ""This Is My Time"", thats a great purchase"
3,an interesting film about lust vs. love,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Fighting Elegy"" known in Japan as ""Kenka erejii"" is about a young Japanese man living with a Roman Catholic family in prewar Japan. He begins to have fellings for the daughter but cannot be sure whether his felings are true love or the lust of adolescent hormones. The daughter tries to reform him into not having lustful thoughts.This film is unique in its depiction a Japanese family that is Catholic while a vast majority of Japan is Buddhist or Shinto. I though the film to be impressively made.The only special feature is a theatrical trailer which is very unusual for a Criterion release."
1,Scatters and Extra Bits,"This movie has extra stuff in it that are like, too much details cause. And besides they don't make no sense when there in they. You now its not good when a kid loses insurance!"
2,Another remake of Home Alone,"As far as I'm concerned, this is just another remake of Home Alone but not as intertaining. I really thought that the movie would be much better than it was. I would never rent it again."
3,not for children,I saw this movie when I was younger and it gave me nightmares. Definitely not for children. Do not be deceived by the cute talking horses
2,Pretty bad...,"Let's be honest, if two little girls were kidnapped by gross old men they wouldn't be acting so smart-alick and stuck up.This movie is boring from the start. You can tell their trying to make it entertaining, but it's far from.And who is the black horse on the front? Neither the horse or pony is black coated. Come on, if they don't even realize that they put the wrong horse on the cover... maybe they shouldn't have made a movie.Not for a younger audience."
1,This Movie is in Bad Taste,"If your child is under 11, I would advise against this movie. Aside from the very poor acting, which is forgivable in a children's movie, there are many problems with it. We turned it off about a 1/4 of the way through. One of the more disturbing scenes shows two creepy looking men observing children at the playground. This precedes the uneccessary scene in which you think someone is sneaking up to one of the girl's bedroom window while she is asleep in her bed. Another inappropriate scene shows the pony dreaming of his mother getting hit by a drunk driver, (yes, they show the drunk man driving the car while guzzling a bottle of something). This movie is in bad taste. Too bad, since the horse scenes which we saw were adorable. There are so many wonderful horse movies available for the young horse lover in your family, but this isn't one of them."
1,"Bad taste, bad production","One of the most appalling films I have ever seen. Contrary to the above kids' reviews, my kids absolutely hated it. It's is poorly done on all levels (acting, direction, editing, and writing) and it is so bad it is actually disturbing to watch. When it tries to be funny it is not at all. When it tries to be suspenseful it is boring and, worst of all, when it tries to be cute, it is in bad taste. A movie has to try very hard to be this bad."
1,Terrifying! Not for the 7 and under crowd!,"My 7 year old daughter and I rented & watched this movie last night. We should have shut it off. For some reason, we thought it would get better, but it never did. At first, it looked like it would be an entertaining tale about 2 girls being kidnapped by a couple of buffoons. However, there was nothing entertaining about this. It was just, plain scary for my little girl. The scenes where the 2 goofy kidnappers stalked the girls were much too suspenseful and realistically scary. The pony's recurring nightmare of his mother being killed was also very frightening and disturbing.I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone. It wasn't well done at all and it wasn't one bit entertaining. Furthermore, it petrified my little girl. I wish I could give it zero stars. I have nothing good to say about this movie."
2,Entertaining... if you like violent kids' movies,"When their humans are kidnapped, two talking equines risk everything to find and rescue them. Two-Bits (voiced by Matthew Bartilson) is a pony haunted by the recurring dream of his mother's death, and Pepper (voiced by Lance LeGault) is an older horse who literally dodges a bullet. (Word of warning: Although Two-Bits & Pepper seems to be meant for young children it's an incredibly violent, disturbing movie.)Staci Layne Wilson"
4,Two-Bits & Pepper,I thought it was full of adventure and exitment. When I first saw it I was scared the horse was going to die and the girls were going to get kidnapped. I won't tell you what happens though. If you like excitment and adventure buy this book today.
4,Great Movie for girls,"If you have a daughter that likes horses, this movie is great. Much better than what we were expecting. Joe Piscopo does a great job. Girltastic!"
4,As expected.,"These nails get shot into wood, and they do that well most of the time. A few of the coils have been tangled, which jams the gun. Now I unroll the coils slightly to check for this, and it's OK for me since I'm not a pro. If I was I wouldn't want to have to deal with this though."
3,Pleasant Enough,"This CD is plesant enough, but doesn't have the magic of the 'Buena Vista Social Club', or the CDs of Ruben Gonzales. The musical tempos of track after track are the same. The songs seem to be an opportunity to showcase various instruments, and all get to take their turn, with no special reason for doing so. This CD would provide good background music at a party...it's lively enough, but people wouldn't feel bad about talking over it."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this travel mug because I have another Timolino product -Timolino VMB-38TMDS 12 oz. Vacuum Infuser Bottle Desert Silver- and I love it. I wanted another mug holding 12 ounces or less, just for coffee though, so I got this one. Overall, it's fine. I just have a few complaints:I can't easily use it when driving because I have to completely unscrew the lid to drink out of it. Once the lid is unscrewed, I have an open container that is more likely to spill, and that loses heat more readily. As long as I keep it shut, it's great. Then I can't actually use it though.I'll use it but look for something better."
1,Gatco Towel Ring,"Don't buy this item or any towel holder product with the same installation process. This is most difficult accessory to install. It's almost impossible to tighten the cover plate to the base plate when you get to the step of using their flimsy Allen wrench. The whole system is terribly completed and doesn't come with directions. The end result, I didn't use the two towel rings I purchased. Do not buy this item unless you enjoy struggling to hang it!"
5,Excellent quality,I really like it and bought several of it. The ring support is tight so I can adjust ring. It's perfect for kitchen or bathroom
3,Another compilation with the same big hits.,"With the sole exception of the closing track (""Cosas Nativas"") virtually every song on this 12-track CD can be found on the 1994-released ""Oro Salsero 20 Exitos"" 2-CD set. Given the fact that Tommy Olivencia's decade at TH-Rodven Records (1979-89) gave him some of his all-time biggest hits it's a shame that PolyGram/Universal Music Latino has not reissued most of his best LPs for the label on CD."
5,"Glad I bought it, thanks to the reviews on Amzon!","Firt off I must say I started not to purchase the VP-02 because it looks rather cheap. But I took a chance and I'm glad I did. I was pleased with the features it has, FM tuner, voice recording, 4 EQ settings, case with belt clip, ease of operation, the display is really esay to read and the ability to expand the memory was a big plus. You don't find that on most players.The software is great also, but I perfer to use Music Match to download my songs because I can select the song straight from my playlist without have to remember which songs I wanted to hear.The player software works great on XP too! no problem there. The Pulse 02 is a great little player."
4,Awesome little player,"I decided to give the Virgin MP3 player a chance because it had the FM tuner option. This little unit performs much better than expected. I used a IBM compatible computer and installing the software and transfering music is a breeze. You can even install the Media Player plug in which lets you transfer music in the Windows Media player window. It comes with a nice little case with a belt clip, but you do have to take it out to connect the USB cable. The other feature that is fantastic is that the unit can accept and additional memory card up to 256MB for a total of 384MB. Thats a lot of music on such a tiny player. I'm surprised I'm so happy with this unit. I'm usually a high end buyer, (Sony, Panasonic, etc), but you really can't go wrong with this great little player."
5,Awsome mp3 player,"To answer the previous review i would try and fix the properties on itunes so that when you put a cd on the computer it dosn't put any prodection or security on it. If you put all of you cds on it that way it should work. For the review, i think it worked perfectly in every way and the only thing that is weirdabout it is it is the exact same thing as the mpio fl-100??"
1,The real deal,"This digital music device is a cheap ripoff of the MPIO FL100. It is stupid. Buy the mpio!!!Matthew McCarthy,Sales Representative, Virgin Inc."
4,"Politics and Intrigue, wrapped in a Periphery-coated shell","While on the surface the novel seems to be about Avanti's Angels, a (sometimes) down-on-it's-luck mercenary unit, the true focus of the story brings a number of major powers, both of the Inner Sphere and of the Periphery, into a head-on collision on a remote planet in the Periphery, leaving the Angels squarely in the middle.It takes more than PFM (Pure F...ing Magic) to get them out... and not necessarily in one piece, either...Double Blind is a book that should be read by any true BattleTech fan, every Game Master looking for a new hook, and especially all of you Word of Blake and Periphery nuts out there."
3,Fantastic setting but falls flat,"The author of this book obviously had some great knowledge of battletech history and has written this book in a style that references past events very well. However the biggest let-down of this book is the writing style of the battle sequences. Loren might say something like The missile hit his mech on the side carving off nearly 3 tons of armor, and then later she looked at the damage report and it showed that she only had 2 tons of armor left on the head of her mech. Or in the post-battle scenes... Still she had managed to salvage a couple of small lasers and several tons of armor It feels as if it is describing a battletech boardgame tournament where mech tonnage and armor levels matter more than a good description. it's hard to explain but if you read this book you will know what I mean."
5,Understanding batteries,Michael Bates' review is in error. All true rechargeable batteries are 1.2 volts so this charger is operating at the correct specifications. Non-rechargeable batteries are 1.5 volts.
1,Do Not Buy This Charger Without Reading This First!!!!!!,"I wish that I could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately I can't. The reason is because it was dead on arrival. I essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick. It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit! At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss. Don't make the same mistake. Steer clear of this piece of junk."
1,you're not going to save any money with this,"they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill. The batteries charged lasted atleast five hours, so no complaints there, but the charger would keep coming out from the wall. It only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it wouldn't stay all the way in, I tried several outlets, finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all."
1,incompatible with my mp3 player,"I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player. When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries. Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player. I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's ""memory effect"" or ""voltage depression,"" my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much ""juice"" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit."
1,Do Not Buy,This is a 1.2 volt battery charger. Useless for anything that requires AAA 1.5 volt batteries.
2,misrepresentation,"The book, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, was bought from Books4Less through Amazon. The description was that it was ""gently"" worn and in good shape. It arrived with ripped pages, dog-eared pages and in poor shape. Plus the S&H was more than the book itself! I will never order from that company again. I wrote to them directly and got no response. Hopefully, Amazon will contact them and inform them of my dissatisfaction."
3,snooze pillow,"the pillow is nice, large size but it is difficult for my son to adjust it around his neck or side of head when he wants to sleep so he ends up not using it. I would have to stop the car and help him with the pillow."
1,Not as appears.,"The Snoozer does not fit as pictured. And the velco is very uncomfortable. We tried all different ways to have it attached to the seatbelt, but not very successful."
3,seat belt snoozer,"sold to encourage the use of seat belts by my grandchildren, didn't perform or rather they didn't comply as expected/hoped. Perhaps if I had started them younger. Two for goodwill!"
1,"Quality good, but scratchy velcro straps at the neck","I got this for my 4 and 6 year olds to help them stay upright when they fall asleep in their bottom-only booster seats (ie not the chair type).They didn't work for that - rats! - but most strange to me was that the straps that anchor the Snoozer to the seat belt are plain old velcro straps, and right at the curve, where the Snoozer turns to wrap around the neck. So, they were uncomfortable to the children. The quality of the product was good.Back to the booster chairs with wings for us, then!"
2,Does not work with high back booster seats,I bought two of these pillows for our spring break road trip. My kids are 4 and 7 and ride in full booster seats (with the head rest and belt guide). We secured the pillows as directed only to find that they pushed the kids' heads forward and did not keep them from flopping around. They might work better when the kids are bigger and can sit in backless boosters.
3,A little awkward for my 4yr old,"My 4yr old refused to use this as it was very uncomfortable for her in her toddler seat. I, on the otherhand, loved it for myself when she refused to use it on our trip."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Bought 2 of these because we are taking a road trip in late August. I have two children under 4, so keeping them comfortable and able to sleep in their seats is a priority for this trip. I was excited to find these set belt pillows but very disappointed when I received them and returned them the next day. The fabric is not soft at all and the velcro straps are huge. The pictures on the website, seem to be deceiving as the straps are hidden and the pillows look larger than they really are. I ended up buying 2 very cute and soft body style pillows/stuffed animals from IKEA in the kids department. They are not seat belt pillows, but they are the perfect size and the kids love them."
1,Not from Rustic Natural Cedar,"Many of the items this seller sells in their cedar line are not what they say it is. The pictures are stolen from the Rustic Natural Cedar company, and the product is certainly not theirs. In my opinion, this violates a lot of rules and this seller should be banned from Amazon.com."
4,Cool Rustic Bed,"Looks great, very sturdy, & makes me feel like I'm sleeping in a lodge. I only wish I could've put it together by myself, but it really takes 2 ppl to assemble. Nothing else to complain about...if that's even really a complaint..."
5,Great bed for great price,"The bed looks great. It took a while to put it together and then I finely sanded then sealed the wood. It took about 5 hours total, working by myself for most of the assembly. The wood looked good and I simply adjusted the pieces with larger veins so that they were not visible (my preference). I was a little worried about the bed sagging in the middle (some other websites recomend a center stabilizer) so I went to my local hardware store and purchased a leg, which I cut to the proper height and screwed into the center support, in the middle. I think it is worth doing this to avoid issues later on. Also, with a full size boxspring, the bed is really high. I am ordering a low profile box spring to get the bed back to a normal height. All in all, Great bed - especially for the price!"
2,Scratched,Going to look great in my truck bed after I repaint. Large scratch on side of the handle. Wished it had a quick release so I can be removed easily for hauling stuff.
5,Give our boys an A+ on this one!,"'NSync fans...this single is a must. Just look at that photo above...how can you resist those faces? Not only is ""I'll Never Stop"" a great song that you know you want to have, but the ""Bye Bye Bye"" remixes just make you wanna get up and shake your bonbon to the melodious voices of pop music's biggest stars. My advice would be to buy, buy, buy this single. You won't regret it."
5,I'll Never Stop listening,"I bought this CD single I'LL NEVER STOP the other day and the 3 versions of the song blew me away. It has a catchy beats like the older NSYNC songs a la TEARING UP MY HEART and I WANT YOU BACK. I kept playing CD single non-stop. I don't understand why the song is not on the U.S. album. We Americans are always deprive of fabulous goods that exist overseas. Anyway, if you're an NSYNC fan, and even if you are not a die hard fan, you must buy this single. Plus the remixes of BYE BYE BYE are awesome."
5,Fun Song!,"I agree with the previous reviews, this is definitely a song that takes ya back a few years to the old days of *N Sync very ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" infused... and if u listen really closely, u can even here a lil of ""I Want You Back"". It's a great song and I definitely recommend it to any *N Sync or pop music fan!"
2,Not my fave,"I got this single because all of the reviews here say that it's a great song, but much as I love *NSYNC, I have to say this is not one of their best. The biggest reason is that I really have to concentrate to hear them and to know that it's *NSYNC singing - I can easily imagine BSB or Britney Spears singing this song. This is the only song of theirs I've come across that really doesn't let them stand out and is an obvious product of the Cheiron factory. It really doesn't belong on NSA because it doesn't take them where they want to go. OTOH, I like the Bye Bye Bye remixes as *danceclub* songs, and I don't know why a lot of people don't like them."
5,A very cool single!,"The single is really cool. The song is really good. Some people say that it reminds them of ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" but I think it sounds more like ""I Want You Back"". It has the same theme as that song and it sounds like the older *NSYNC songs. It's really cool. The tracks on this single are 1)I'll Never Stop (radio edit), 2) I'll Never Stop (album version), 3) I'll Never Stop (instrumental version) and then they have two remixes of ""Bye Bye Bye"". The track 4 remix is really good. There's added echoes and different tempos and it's really good. The track 5 remix is ok. It isn't great but it's worth listening to a couple of times. This import is worth the money though. I recommend it."
4,Awesome CD! Final song was OK.,"The CD is very good. The song I'll Never Stop, with the radio edit, album version, and the instrumental, are all really good versions of the song. The two remixes of Bye, Bye, Bye are also really good. The first remix is better to me than the second. I liked the Riprock remix a lot. The second remix, the Teddy Riley Club Mix, had a shocking noise at the beginning that really annoyed me at first. But after that, the rest of the song was good, except for towards the end, where the annoying shocking noise came back again. But overall, I would have to rate the CD four out of five stars. The only two reasons why I'm giving it four out of five stars are for the annoying shocking noise during the beginning of the Teddy Riley Club Mix and at the end of it, and the fact that the CD is not my absolute favorite."
5,A GREAT QUALITY BOOK,"Goes into great detail for the astounding passion flower plants. So beautiful to behold. These plants, with more than three hundred different types, are some of the most stunning and beautiful flowering vines in the world. This is a must have book."
4,Help for a small stuck car,"I live in Minnesota and drive a small car, so my dad bought these for me several winters ago and I have used them to get unstuck in snow (in alleys & parking lots, not ditches) when no one is around to help push, shovel, etc.. I even lent them to my neighbor once to get his car unstuck. I haven't used anything else to get unstuck other than kitty litter and these are much easier to use than kitty litter. I would not drive in the winter without knowing that these are in my car."
3,A little dated but still useful,"The downside of the book is that it was written before Max gained its DSP or video processing capabilities, but it's still useful for newcomers to the programming language. I wish I'd known the book was out there when I started to learn Max/MSP because I was a complete beginner at programming and it would have been a good companion to the tutorials. Winkler did a great job identifying useful topics and explaining them clearly and succinctly, I wish he would write an update to include MSP or even Jitter."
3,More current video series available,This is the old Rick Steves video series from many years ago. Look for the new series titled Rick Steves Europe for update to date information and better visual coverage of destinations.
4,"Oh no, not Rick Steves in the same compartment!","Two things: His travel vids on TV are great pictures and they show one a good bit of the area on which the film is focused and for a good first look prior to travel or maybe for your infirm Grandmother who can no longer pack up the bag to see it herself, these are good ideas. HOWEVER, as a personal note, I find Rick Steves grating noise irritating and his constant 'advice' tiresome (usually there is the warning to be sure to wear your money in your shoe or some such thing; rather like traveling with a midwestern Lutheran church leader. If you go for that, then you won't have any problems. Film=excellent; the guide=not."
5,really nice,Show great scenes from Norway Denmark and Sweden Rick Steves is a perfect host really scenic informative video.
1,Cheap,"Active Musician should discontinue this product or sell it under a different category such as Home Decor. The ""cymbals"" are like thin flat metal washers with no musical quality to them. Active Musician did not include the soft case it was supposed to come with. Do not buy!"
3,Tamorine it's ok,"For the price the tamborine is ok. It is pretty on the outside. There wasn't a lot of effort in the workmanship and there were a lot of rough edges along the wood in the wholes where the cymbols rest. If you are a dancer these get caught on your skirt. I had to spend a lot of time sanding down the rough edges and refinishing the tamborine.Egyptian Tambourine, 8 1/2"" (Purchased on 07/21/2011)by Mid-East"
4,Pflueger medalist 1500 reel,I bought this pflueger medalist 1500 reel on a suggestion from my brother in law. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. The reel has very smooth action and the construction is a very durable design. I will recommend it to others.
5,from a fairly new fan,"joe henderson sounds better here than he did playing on his own recordings, and certainly better than on recordings led by mccoy tyner in the 60s. andrew hill was a magnificent composer, there's no getting around that. i keep seeing him listed as an avant-garde pianist, and i hear him as anything but avant-garde, his playing graced with a humility that unified whatever group he put together for his compositions.i've said more about andrew hill than i've said about black fire. i've still many recordings by hill to hear, and so far, from what i've heard, i haven't been disappointed. black fire may prove to be one of my favorite recordings by hill."
4,taxes,"The product arrived safetly and in good conditions, the only problem was that I have to pay 50US$ on taxes, so it was really expensive. Is there other way in reducing taxes?"
1,He's NOT a chef.,"Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away."
1,Wow. (not in a good way),"A fellow reviewer, Laura Probst, fairly summed up the beginning of the book but if you're looking for a better ending, you're not going to find it. After being held hostage for several by 20 Sasquatch-demon things, Tess (while drinking beer, eating pizza, and working on her next book- and please remember this is WHILE she is being held hostage, not after) she goes into a magical fighting frenzy and kills all 20 subsequently passing out. The US army closes in and...well, it's all over. Sort of. There's a random scene with a recluse novelist and the book closes with yet another sci-fi con and a filk (I didn't have any idea what this was until I Googled it and the author never really explains it) song. None of the many, many plot points really ever wrap up or get explain thoroughly. If you can read the first hundred pages and enjoy it, maybe you will like the book but if you can barely get through them, like I did, SKIP IT. I wish I'd stopped sooner."
1,Easily one of the worst I've read in a long time.,"Hounding the Moon reads like the first draft of someone's first novel. As a long-time member of fandom, I found the premise intriguing. But the novel was very disappointing. The writing was choppy and amateurish. The plot didn't hang together. The characterization was all over the place. The story didn't flow. I kept hoping that it would get better after a rocky start, but it never did."
4,One of the most underated albums EVER,"Man, this is a great CD as every damn track is just high quality stuff. Don't run wild was the first song I ever heard from the DFs but this album is SO much more than that song. The ballads on this CD are absolutely great. I Still Want u, Coupe Da Ville, Fade to Blue are all classics.Night on the town, Its Alright and really this whole CD is just really high quality.Criminally underated album right here. If you can get your hands on it do so."
5,Hang on to your hats!!,"Canada here -- we don't have Boyzone yet, they haven't hit our market. I saw them on Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50 Bday bash on television the other night. They are going to hit this market hard and they better be ready for mobbing girls. Their voices were beautiful and the song they did, ""What ever"" is really uplifting. We don't know their names yet but I will guarantee you, in two years they'll be on the top of the North American charts. Good luck guys and enjoy the ride. If only we could find a website with information about the group."
4,"Boyzone's biggest, most truthful fan","The Boyzone Cd - ""A different Beat"" is, I personally think, better than ""Said and Done"" but unfortunately not as good as their recent release. Boyzone's music is very relaxing and great for a 'Girlie' night in. It is easy listening and most girls hearts melt when they hear the sound of Ronan's Irish voice. I have rated this cd with 4 stars as I don't think it is one of their best but it is still really good. But of course I would say that being a really loyal fan!!!!!!!"
3,Its pleasant but could be better,"Its got a very smoothing quality about the album and I like the song ""A different Beat"" especially. Although I find that the accent of Ronan a little bit to much, and can be quite irritating as I listen along. My advice to all out there is: If you are trying very hard to keep awake, eg. when you are burning midnight oil trying to study for a test/exam DONT listen to this album."
1,I wish I knew,"Would love to give a glowing review of this product, tell you how challenging it is, how many enjoyable hours spent solving the puzzles,etc....trouble is I never received this item. It was ordered over a month ago. Maybe someone else can fill you in on the wonders of this item!"
5,The title says it all!,"The book was released a few weeks before the film. It's about two young women named Connie and Carla(portrayed by Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette in the film) who run away to form a lounge act in various locations. They sing songs from various musicals including THERE ARE WORSE THINGS I COULD DO from ""Grease""(both the musical and the 1978 film). Connie had a longtime dream of meeting her idol Debbie Reynolds. A short time later,BOOM! Reynolds appeared. Now Connie,Carla and Debbie are singing together. Connie and Carla were eluding mafia hitmen who are owed money from the girls and commit murder. As for the film,it got mixed reviews. It was a disappointment compared to Vardalos' previous film,MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. Vardalos wrote or co-wrote the CONNIE & CARLA screenplay(she wrote MBFGW also)."
4,Tons of history,"A whole different slant on the Arthurian legends. At least, different from what I studied many years ago. Found it wonderful reading, but a bit lengthy in descriptions at times."
4,Arthur - Stephen Lawhead,"Lawhead's continues his Pendragon series with Arthur. Like the first two books, I also enjoyed reading this book. In this story, we see Arthur become the foretold high king ruler of the Isle of the Mighty. We are taken through the arduous process Arthur must undertake to create the Kingdom of Summer. Arthur and Myrddin must combat treasonous kings as well as multiple invasions of Britain by barbarians. The battle sequences are epic and very well told. I'm glad Lawhead chose to use the first person account of the story once again, this time from a perspective of three characters. I gave this book four stars because of two reasons. The ending was a bit odd and appeared abrupt as if injected to meet a deadline. Also, like the the other books, there's a good deal of Christianity wrapped into the story, as there may have been in 4th and 5th century Britain. However, I found it less intertwined and more preachy in this book."
4,"Slightly confusing, but overall very good","This book I found to be slightly confusing, but still a really good read. It was detailed and an interesting twist to the Arthur tales. I found it a cross between young adult and adult and think that multiple age brackets can enjoy the read. There was an epic feel to the tale and the sorcerer was great. Lawhead is an amazing writer and I've enjoyed many of his books. Looking forward to more!"
4,Still excellent,"The third book of the Pendragon Cycle is almost as good as the first two, which is saying alot. I felt that parts of the plot were a little weaker than in the first two books, but it was still far better than many other accounts of the Arthur legends that I have read. If there was a 4 and a half star rating, I would have used it for this book. Good conclusion to the cycle, while everything doesn't fall neatly in place, it ends realistically and believably, and doesn't cheapen or disgrace the first two books, as many third books in trilogies do."
3,Loosing the plot,"This is still a moderately acceptable novel, but Lawhead is starting to loose the plot a little. The narrative seems much more fragmented than it could be and his weaving in of his christianity is much more heavy handed.OK, but it doesn't meet the excellent standards of earlier entries the series."
3,Not too bad,"This Arthurian novel promises to be unlike the well-Known magical fantasy most of us know. There is no sorcery to talk of whatsoever, so for all those out there who expects a swish-swash of magic here and there, be ready to be dissapointed. This will serve more as a down-to-earth novel for someone who just want something medievally intriguing"
2,Arthur Pendragon cycle,"Too much emphasis on Christiaity not enough on Cletic social and cultural traditions Merlin was a Druid and sorcerer, not a wannabe priest."
4,"good book, wierd ending","I liked this book because even though there isnt a lot of action happening all the time, Lawhead still manages to make it interesting by writing it well.The characters are well defined and the language very discriptive. Although I dont really understand why he screwed up all the names...was I supposed to know that llenawheg or something is supposed to be Lancelot? Or Gwalchavad Galahad? The main complaint I have about this book is the ending. It ends in wretched defeat and doomsaying, without the sense of triumph and finality you should get after finishing a series. But I enjoyed the whole book untill the end so it was worth my while"
5,A delightful twist on an ancient story,"Third in Stephen R. Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle, Arthur is a refreshing return to this ancient story.The traditional story of Arthur has always been riddled with deceipt, adultery, and intrigue (in the worst sense). Lawhead's re-telling presents a kinder, gentler legend; but even so, the pace will keep every reader's blood pumping.If this reviewer could have re-written the Arthurian legend (or, indeed, any of the Celtic legends), this would be the result."
5,Sony's Best Package Deal!,"Awesome deal for the money. It even has an ""optical"" audio input for ultimate direct digital sound from: sat.tv, dvd and Sony Playstation 2. Also, subwoofer has nice adjustment levels."
4,"soothing, romantic, melancholic, latin beat","this kind of music you can dance, close your eyes, and feel it seducing the hidden moves in the curves of your body...wether alone, or with mr/miss right now...so very latin it makes me proud..."
4,Very Informative,"It is a very helpful source. Although there are so many books about TCP/IP, this is one of the best written especially for readers with basic TCP/IP knowledge and application protocols such as FTP, TELNET..To make more out of this book, it should be accompanied with Volume 3."
4,who wants to be a zillionaire......,"Well worth the investment. WR Stevens has compiled the essential desk drawer reference book on TCP/IP. IP has evolved since 1994 and this book doesn't have the later coverage, but hey, whose got an implementation handle on IPv6 anyway. For the basics, in an easy to read, superbly descriptive and insightful style with great real-world traces and tips from an obvious expert in his field, this text maybe all that you will need on TCP/IP protocols."
5,The Definitive TCP/IP Resource,"Written by the man that help to define TCP, this is a book that belongs on the bookshelf of every network professional. No other reasource even begins to cover the TCP/IP protocol suite in such detail"
2,It might be great if you are a programmer...,"I'm a network engineer and I'll tell you what, the examples in the book are pretty horrible. They spent exactly a half a page on subnetting, which for anyone who knows subnetting, they should have dedicated a seperate chapter to.The book is way too academic and not enough true to life material.If you are looking to find out what every single bit is doing at any given time, then this is the book for you. If you're looking to use this book to set-up your WAN, don't bother."
4,PhD Cand in Network Eng,"It is a very helpful source. Although there are so many books about TCP/IP, this is one of the best written especially for readers with basic TCP/IP knowledge and application protocols such as FTP, TELNET..To make more out of this book, it should be accompanied with Volume 3 which contains example C source codes"
5,A Masterwork on the subject of TCP/IP,"Having come from a rather diverse computer background, I have come accustomed to books being wordy, and sometimes grammatically incorrect. This book is the first in a long time to break that general rule. As a beginner to TCP/IP and the other topics discussed in this text, I have found this book to be concise and clear in all the items discussed. It is simple enough for anyone with some basic computer experience to understand. The book itself beautiful from the cover to the wonderful illustrations included. Though Hard Cover books are often frowned upon because of their size, this book will likely be a proud addition to your collection. I used this text as an adjunct to my CS 268 Class at WVU a class on internet programming and it follows beautifully not only with the lectures, but in the way the material is organized and presented. Don't let the price tag scare you, this book is worth every nickel and dime spent on it."
5,This is the TCP/IP bible.,"I have been using this book as the definitive point of reference for almost 6 years. It is by far the most used (and dog eared) book in my techinical library and has settled many an argument. This is clear, concise and complete information that no networking professional should be without."
4,Very good reference,This book is an excellent reference or source to really learn some of the innards of TCP/IP. Very good diagrams and everthing is explained in an easy to understand way. I would recommend some basic to intermediate knowledge of network before picking this up.
3,Not exhaustive,"Not a very exhaustive treatment of the protocols, esp. TCP. Leaves a lot of gaps like not explaining the SND, RCV & SEG variables & how they are used for error checking. You will find the RFCs alot more exhaustive & they come free of cost."
5,Three Of The Best!!!!,"I believe that Civil War On Sunday, Revolutionary War on Wednesday, and Twister on Tuesday are THE best three Magic Tree House books. While they are all good, these three stand alone (I can't wait for Camelot!).Perfect for first graders to third graders!!!The blend of fact and fiction makes for great read alouds in the classroom and great springboards for studying historical topics!!SUPERB!!!"
5,Critique of Twister on Tuesday,"In my opinion this book was superb. This story was about two young children, Jack and Anniewho go on a quest to rescue the kingom of Camelot. They need to discover something to follow,to send,to learn, and something to lend. On this adventure they need to learn something. this subject takes them to the prairie in the time of the pioneer. In the prairie they find themselves at a schoolhouse educated by an 18 year old and there they find they find something to learn while saving their class from a twister (tornado). What I liked about this story was that there was lots of truthful details and it was weel built. I reccomend this book to reading levels 2 to 4 and who like endless series."
3,Twister on Tuesday review,I read Twister on TuesdayI thought it was goodThe history is two kids (Jack and Henna) going a school. In the school have four students the house is a twister class.The tornado is going to the school so Jack and Henna run for they house.I think kids of eleven years old like this book because it&#65533;s nice.I recommend this book because it&#65533;s nice.
3,twister on tuesday,"This book is about two main charactor, named Jack and Annie, and every day they ask if they can go out side to play, but they actually go out to this tree house that is full of books, and they find a book they like well in this book they found a book with tornadoes in and they decided to wish to go into that book and it took themthere and in the story Annie becomes a teacher who work in a wooden place that had one room and they called it a school. So these funny looking shapes start to appear in sky made out of clouds that looked likecones and then they started coming down to the floor. If you like old histoy, school and/or tornadoes than I would sujest that you read this book."
5,Really works!,"I was a bit skeptical of gopher traps in general since I've never really heard of them. Well, after watching my lawn get torn up by a gopher, I turned to Amazon and found this trap. I opted for this one since it was enclosed, which would appear to ""funnel"" the gopher into the trap. Anyway, per the instructions, I found an appropriate spot, and lo and behold, caught a gopher within a day! Totally satisfied and recommend this trap."
5,Excellent after adjustment,"My first Black Box worked very well, so I bought three more. Some of the new ones didn't work; the gophers filled them with dirt without springing them. I tested the triggers with a postal scale and found that the good traps would trigger with less than two ounces of force, while the bad ones took up to six ounces. I bent the hooks on the trigger wires (the wire the gopher pushes) until I got them all to trigger at under two ounces. I also filed some down a little. Now they all work very well. I am catching a couple of dozen gophers a year. These traps don't work on the moles in my area, because the moles go under them instead of entering. The traps are durable. The wire is either stainless or some rust resistant alloy. As others have said, you have to dig a significant hole to set these. If you are trying not to disturb a lawn, it is best to dig out chunks of sod and keep them cool and damp until the gopher is caught. Then you can replace the chunks in the hole."
3,Caught my first gopher,"At first I thought I was doing something wrong. It took about two months before I got my gopher. I would give this item 4 stars but the instructions on usage are very sparse and caused me to do a lot of trial and error before I finally got him. However, the trap worked well and I can reuse it now. Reset it and forget it so I would recommend it."
5,The best trap I've ever used,"Simple design, sturdy trap. Unlike other gopher traps, there is no need to stake this trap down since it fits snugly in the gopher tunnel. Easy to set, 3 for 3 on kills...got the gopher within a few hours each time."
5,Worked Quickly,"I set the Victor version of the Macabee traps in opposite directions in a burrow. I found one of the traps triggered, buried in dirt, but no gopher. After four days of the same thing happening, I tried this box trap and got him. However, it trapped the back end of the gopher and didn't kill it."
5,works great for Florida Pocket Gophers,"My first suggestion is to make sure of what exact pest is digging up your yard. My husband and I had first thought these mounds or hills were made by moles, or maybe armadillos, and after research for local yard problems, found they were made by the Southeastern Pocket Gopher. We have the other 2 pests here too, but their habits are different, and we'll have to get something else for the moles.We had tried everything to repel or remove this critter, and finally ordered one of these traps after reading good reviews here. To my great surprise, we got the pesky Pocket Gopher the very next morning after setting the trap. We did use the carrot trick at the back of the trap, as shown on the instructions.So much damage was done to our yard and shrubs, and it appears it was just this one pocket gopher all along. But if another one moves in, we will be prepared with this Victor Black Box trap. Very satisfied customer!"
2,Too Early to tell,"I used it twice so far, once with Peanut butter & the second time with a carrot, and both times it failed. I thought I had set it up properly, but maybe not. I tried the poison peanuts with a point type applicator sold elsewhere here & killed both a Gopher which had eluded me in the past with 4 other type traps, and I also killed 2 other moles all with 1st try. I may give this Box another try in the future, but the poison works best for me. Ernest Riedel, Bushnell,FL"
2,gopher trap,Item was listed as gopher- mole trap. Really is designed for gophers. I feel mislead on this item. However it should work well for gophers. Not really designed for moles.
5,black box gopher trap,"A friend of ours told us about the ""black box gopher trap"" and how effective it was. I went to Amazon (my favorite on line shopping center), typed in the description, read the guys pitch, and bought one trap. Delivery was quick. We immediately set the trap and within one day caught a monster gopher. It was easy to unload the gopher from the trap. No guts, no fuss.We almost immediately bought 3 more traps. I gave one to my neighbor. I highly recommend this trap to anyone with gopher problems!!Sincerely,Mike Barret"
3,KINDA SMALL TRAP- APPROX 3.5 or 4 opening X 7 inches long,"This trap is made for ""minnie mole"", or ""Geo the gopher"". You know the tiny chevrolet Geo?Honestly, don't think it will work for me 'cause I actually saw the one that has taken up residence in my front, and back yard, and he aint that small. I should refer to him as a ground hog instead :) Maybe this trap will catch something roaming around, that doesn't belong.... If it does catch gargantuan gopher I'll report back.Sorry to say the lever let me down. The lever on the trap has to be set on the edge of the hook for it to work. I even decided to dig the trap up, because I noticed that overnight, still had no catch, but the bait was gone. I wiggled the hook, this thing did not even budge. So I am assuming that the hook on my trap is bent too far closed. Washed it, and disinfected it, and sent it back. I am trying the huge rat trap with bait, then I'll report back with my results."
5,Wonderful Book!,This is a wonderful book to help children understand that people's brains work differently. It may help them understand that being different isn't a bad thing.
5,"WONDERFUL book for all children, not just those with ADD (ADHD)",I got this book last week and my grandkids love it. It is beautifully illustrated and the message is very important. Our society has come to worship book smarts (but that is only ONE kind of smart). All kids need to know that they are smart in their own special way and this book shows them that. I highly recommend it ... and take advantage of the parent tips in the back to help guide your little one into a discussion about his/her own brain.
3,missing inportant parts,"Richard Exley says that he follows scripture, but I did not find that so. From page 51 to page 56 there is no mention of an angel coming to Joseph and telling him not to fear to take Mary for his wife. Then on page 57 he tells her that an angle told him about the baby. It sounds to me like he was lying to her since in the previous pages, it is not mentioned. Was Richard just thinking to make the book longer? This book is being read to children. Some of them probably don't hear the real story. They will grow up to read this version to their children and the truth will be lost. If a book is going to be written about the stories in the bible, keep to the exact story. The bible is an exciting book. It does not need to be changed.I have read some of Richard's other books and only one, partly, lived up to my expectations."
3,Gross tasting,I got these from the store the other day and the taste is nasty. They are good for sore throats though.
3,Great swing set,"Great swing set, but very hard to understand directions for a beginner. They said it would take 2 adults 8 hours to build. It took 13 days. But once it was done my grandson plays on it every time he is here and loves it."
5,A lot fun,"Jason gammon review spot on, took about 10 hrs with help from neighbor ( thanks Wayne).TipsCheck and inspect all hardware, I had a bent bolt.5 lbs of screws smart move.Use 2 separate drill for lag and other screwsGo on Craigslist and get a used slide save a ton of moneyIf you enjoy projects then this is for youIf your time is more valuable than money, savings is about 500 dollars approximate savingsDon't forget about mulch to surround play set, cheaper than hurt kid.Have fun!!!!"
3,john wayne collection,there were two of the movies that my wife wanted in this collection and so i got them for her was there a way to make them full screen
5,Happy with this,The product is great. The shipping process damaged the outer box and apparently UPS re-packaged with larger box. One strip was missing. But manufacture provided satisfactory partial refund for that even if it may not be their fault.I will keep ordering again.
4,Dance ditties for Cold War cuties,"Part of Chicago's Wax Trax invasion of the mid-80s, Ministry's _Twitch_ was a darker, more aggressive alternative to the usual dance floor fluff (Blancmange? Tin Tin? Oh, brother!). This album is described as Ministry's ""transitional"" stage and their evolution from 12"" club mainstay (god, wasn't ""Over the Shoulder"" just great to dance to?) to hillbilly speed-metal gods is best sampled on _Land of Rape and Honey_ and _The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste_. _Twitch_ has a number of good songs--""We Believe"" and ""Just Like You"" are perfect, bass-pounding songs. The lyrics reference the Cold War, the dehumanizing effects of modern life and a couple more cheery topics. Other favorites are ""All Day"" and ""Isle of Man""---the perfect soundtrack to an industrialized wasteland. If you are expecting super aggro ala _Psalm 69_, you will be disappointed. If you're looking to relive your clubbing days, do yourself a favor and get _Twitch_, no 80s collection is complete without it."
4,Near perfect,"This is an album that I use to play a lot on Friday nights when my friends and I were on our way to a show, or the city, or just for a good time out. It gets you pumped up. I think it's a really solid piece of work, near perfect. It's industrial, yet it's not. Whatever it is classified under, the album works. It is my favorite Ministry release. As far as the other Ministry releases, I much prefer the earlier to the recent."
5,A great touchstone album of early industrial music.,"This is one of my favorite albums. I can't put it on without being immediately transported back to the early 80s, when I was just finishing high school and heading off to college.This is harsh, discordant music and it isn't all that easy to listen to, but once you've been converted, this is truly memorable stuff, perhaps my favorite of all the Ministry albums."
3,Not the best Ministry record,"It's no Psalm 69, but it's decent industrial dance bound to satisfy your electronic music cravings."
4,Twitchy,"the beginnings of industrial...how it brings back memories! several good tracks; great transitional ""album"" for Ministry."
2,This is NOT industrial at all,"I don't know why other reviewers keep calling this Ministry's entry into industrial music. There is only ONE thing on this record that has any similarities to today's Ministry, and that is a few voice excerpts from movies or wherever. Otherwise, this is a PURELY synth electro pop record you'll find played at your local dance club. If you're a fan of today's Ministry Metal/Punk/Industrial tunes, DON'T buy this record, it'll disappoint.Now I know this is sounding like I hate the record, which I don't, I just don't like it very much. I can listen to about 2 tracks on this record but that's it. All the others just seem kind of uninspired, repetitive and lacking in dance rhythm.So my point is, if you think you're going to be buying a NIN ""pretty hate machine"" type record which truly intertwines pop and industrial, you won't, don't listen to those other reviews, this is not industrial AT ALL."
5,Fit my gokart well,"Glad I bought it, fits fine and doesn't slip. Will buy again when this one wears out in a few years."
1,Stuck in the snow,"I'm sorry to say that I was very disapointed with the quality of this product. I had 2 concerns with the build quality of the sleigh, 1st the side rails were not mounted securely and were prone to wobbling which did not instill confidence in their safety factor. Secondly was with the mounting set-up for the runners of the sleigh, the surface that the runers mounted too was almost twice as wide as the actual runners themselves which caused the snow to build up under the sleigh creating a fair amount of drag, which could cause the sleigh to become unstable and tip over. I have since returned the sleigh and am currently looking for another that is built better."
3,cute,Sled looks very cute & is made out of wood panels. One issue i have with it is that it sits so low to the ground & the panels are not nailed - they are tapled together; not sure how sturdy it is. I definetly suggest to get the pad for this sled - just to keep the snow out of it....
3,Flexible Flyer wooden baby sleigh,I was disappointed that there was no sticker that said it was a Flexible FlyerIn the ad it showed one. The sled is a brand name & I feel it should have had one. It looks like an imitation.
4,Baby Flyer sled,I bought this for a birthday gift for a one year old. It was perfect. Very well made and just the right size.I would definately recommend this product.
5,Multi-purpose Cozy Bag,"This is a really soft, cozy fleece bag you can use as a liner for extra warmth inside a heavier sleeping bag (it really does add the purported 10 degrees of warmth) or unzipped as a light blanket for warmer weather. The ""cozy factor"" can't be emphasized enough--this thing really feels great against the skin and makes sliding in or underneath very enjoyable and welcoming. This bag stays warm and dry even when it's raining or damp. It rolls up to a small size easily and has an attached elastic band to secure the roll. The Ziplow zipper works great, with no snagging. 5 stars, for real."
1,kids didn't like it,I got this for my kids and me but it was so boring and not worth the money. Not an attention getter.
5,Perfect,If your kids like the wonder Pets and you don't want cable... get these dvd's. Had about all you would want and plenty to keep the kids from getting bored.
5,The DVDs saved the day! :-),"My son (14 months) has LOVED the Wonder Pets since he was 3 months old. I have at least 20 episodes on the DVR. I purchased this collection so he could bring his favorite pals on our LONG road trip. These DVDS were sold at an excellent price and contain so many episodes! Once again Linny, Tuck, and Ming Ming too saved the day!"
4,Another great Kelton,"Elmer Kelton could not write a bad book, and The Bitter Trail is no exception. Fine, fine writing. My only criticism is the fact that he uses a lot of full sentences of SPanish without translating them. For those who don't read Spanish, it would be tough! As the first reviewer said, he is a good replacement for L'Amour, only better. Another great read is ANYTHING by Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'AMour. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading his stuff, pick some up. He's another L'Amour/Kelton, and a surefire winner. Kelton and Jonas ought to make a great combination together, Kelton writing about Texas and Jonas writing about everywhere else!"
3,Unknown Civil War Theatre,"A good story. Perhaps more ""stock"" western than some of Kelton's other works. Entertaining and educational with regard to the role of Mexico in the Civil War."
1,Not the same,"I totally agree with the other review. I ordered this small bottle to travel with and it's a rose color instead of purple and it doesn't smell anything like the Herve Leger Paris that I love. I did order another small bottle from another retailer and it's exactly what I wanted. Not sure what's going on with this particular product, but it is NOT the same as the Herve Leger I've been wearing for years. Beware!"
3,ok,I received the eau de toilette but I'm not sure its the true product. I have a small amount of my own supply left and its a different color and slightly different scent than the product sent to me.
1,Not impressed,"Herve has been my signature scent for over 15 years. I was very disappointed when I opened this package. Not only was the color different; not the lavender color that I am use to, this was yellow in color. Also, the scent was not quite right either. In my opinion, this was a close matcth, but not genuine Herve."
1,I didn't receive the item that I ordered.,"I ordered the Herve Leger EAU DE PARFUM .17 OZ MINI, the color is shown as lavender. I received Herve Leger Paris, which is a light yellow color. I'm very disappointed and hesitate to re-order. ""Amazon Verified Purchase""."
1,This thing stinks,"My girlfriend was dying to buy this because several years ago, she really liked it and wanted to try it again, so we bought it. Then, I totally forgot about it, except that every time my girl friend would come home, she'd smell like onion, and I'd like be honey, how much onion did u eat today, and she'd be like nothing at all. This went on for a few days till one day she put on the perfume in front of me and I was like holly crap, THAT'S THE ONION!!!! So yeah, this perfume smells like onion on her. I hate it."
1,SAD,"I was very disappointed in the whole process because I paid for it, received notice that it would arrive in a week, and THEN got a notice that it was unavailable."
2,Just Because it Sounds Old Doesn't Mean it is Any Good,"Some of the most boring guitar riffs that only a hardcore band could bring you. This record also has some of the most bland and untalented vocalist in popular hardcore. Andy (the singer) was probably a gas station attendent before he joined a band. You want old School buy Agnostic Front. If you want politics, read the New York Times or buy a good book. If you want talent, listen to Bach. But for the sake of somthing admirable, don't buy this. These guys play like they are 14."
5,"The sweet ""Truth""","In his four decades in the music business, guitarist Phil Upchurch has established himself as an extremely versatile player. First making his mark as a session player for the legendary Chess label in his hometown of Chicago, he also penned the instrumental hit ""You Can't Sit Down"" which later became a huge hit for the Philly vocal group The Dovells. He also played on George Benson's classics ""Breezin'"", and ""In Flight"". In recent years he's released albums on Ben Sidran's Go Jazz label, but his latest album for the Evidence label is one of his best. Combining tasteful, well chosen covers with original tunes, Upchurch sounds very relaxed and home on ""Tell The Truth"". The best cuts on the album are ""Jack Of Speed"", ""Take Five"", ""Manhattan"", ""Long Gone Bird"" and the title track. One of the best jazz albums of 2001, and one not to be missed."
2,Changed for the worse,"The Twinings black currant tea has always been my favorite tea, for at least 30 years. But recently, they seem to have changed the flavor together with the packaging. Maybe the old yellow packaging looked too much like the Earl Gray Tea package and customers were confused? I have no idea, but please restore the old great flavor back. This new one is almost tasteless (for black currant flavor). I am currently looking for a better black currant tea brand, although I must admit that if I cannot find one, I may still occasionally drink this one. I am simply hooked to black currant flavored black tea!!!"
2,Not like it use to be,"Twinnings has apparently change the ""recipe"" for Black current. - weak and generic. I will not purchase it again. blah"
1,Disappointing,"I've been drinking this tea for years as my standard morning tea. Recently Twinings changed the packaging and the ingredients - there's no flavor, tastes like water. I found a box at my local grocery of the old packaging and compared the two. Definitely has changed - much more flavor in the orginal version."
4,Thought-provoking and very readable,"A very good book, in most ways. It covers some familiar ground, but generally with a fresh perspective. One limitation is that it really does stick to the goal of answering that tiresome, bone-headed criticism of evolution as being ""just a theory."" Thus, much space is devoted to hammering home the definition of the word ""theory."" But this explanation does range through many interesting examples, and is always readable.Where I part company with the author is in his closing statements, to the effect that most of what there is to be discovered has already been discovered. (I paraphrase, badly.) I believe that Ben-Ari underestimates the quantity of what we do not yet know, as well as the potential impact of numerous breakthroughs that can already be foreseen. Of course, that's all speculation, and Ben-Ari's take is at least stimulating.In short, a quick, entertaining, worthwhile read."
5,An impressive and wonderfully entertaining collection,"A Treasury Of Children's Songs: Forty Favorites To Sing And Play is an impressive and wonderfully entertaining collection of simple, classic musical favorites, written with sing-along notes, as well as a brief aside and features a beautiful and illustrative ""museum quality"" work of art next to each song. Tunes such as ""Amazing Grace"", ""Eensy Weensy Spider"", ""She'll Be Comin' 'Round the Mountain"" and more comprise this superb music-making repository which would make a welcome addition to family, school, and community library collections."
4,Great product for the PRICE,I bought this new about 4 years ago. Never - EVER - had a problem with it. Nice power. The only thing I was not proud of was the lack of POWER - only 250 watts - However - For surround sound it was PERFECT
2,"DID NOT RECEIVE THE CORRECT CABOODLE, PLAIN BLACK IS WHAT I RECEIVED!",Very disappointed that I received a plain black one instead of the ones with the shoes and handbags. I could have gone to the store to get a plain black one and not had to pay shipping. This is FALSE advertising!
4,I received the wrong item,"I had order the caboodle with the shoes pattern, But i received a different one with pictures like the statue of liberty, pyramids,... It's alright. but i like the shoe pattern better. As for the space I love it. I didn't use it for make up. I used it for jewelry."
1,WRONG ITEM SENT!,"I am so disappointed. Amazon sent me the wrong Caboodle organizer. The one that I got is 11.5 inches but it is a black textured look with no cute shoe designs. But the worst part of the case is there are only 4 shelves instead of six. I don't like the way the shelves fold out over the handles. If it weren't such a hassle to send this case back I would have.I ordered the 13"" black case too. I am very happy with that one. It is roomy and holds a lot."
1,Pls Send Customers What They Purchased!!!!!,"I had the same problem as some of the other customers... I purchased the item above, but received it in black only, no design...I would have given company a much higher score, but they sent item anyway without any contact informing me that the item I paid for wasn't available. Give the customers the option to decide whether or not they want to cancel the order instead of sending it assuming customers will accept whatever company decides to send!"
3,eh...,"i didn't get the one pictured, it had different city scenes on it but it's all good as i just use it to hold fingernail polish. it was smaller than expected but it's still nice to have"
1,WRONG ITEM,I received a plain black one with only four shelves.EVEN after it came late for some unknown reason.Too much hassle to send it back. UGH
3,Poor quality,"Are these sinks factory seconds??? If so, they should have been labelled as such. They are beautiful, but both of the ones I ordered had rough protrusions on the undersides that scratched my countertop and made levelling the sinks impossible. We managed to chip most of it off, but there is still a good quarter-inch of space between the rim of the sink and the countertop that we had to fill in with caulk. Not the look I was going for."
1,False advertised,"My son received two blocks, this is misleading and falsely advertised, not the photo, 2 black blocks , returned it"
5,Nails work in Paslode,I have bought several boxes of these nails and haven't had any problem with them in my Paslode air nailer. They are heavy and when I orded two boxes they bounced around in the packing box and split apart some so now I order one box at a time. They come in a reasonable amount of time.
5,Framing Nails,"I purchased these nails for use strickly for my Paslode, after ordering them I had read other reviews that these nails cause the nailer to jam. I must of used 1,000 of them and not one has jammed in my nailer. I am definitely pleased with these nails."
5,So Much Fun,My two year old daughter loves these blocks. She plays with them almost everyday. I like to play with them too. She likes to make me a house and car. Very easy to do and so much fun!
2,Fogerty's worst,"I own everything Fogerty ever put out. This is his worst of his solo material by a long shot. For the collector there is one or two good songs that must be purchased, but buy the rest of his catalogue first."
1,Frisbee Material,"Fortunately I borrowed this record from my local library as opposed to buying it. Other than Change In The Weather and the title track, this album is a NUCLEAR DISASTER! The remaining tracks are complete filler where John actually attempts a couple of disco based songs. The vocals are quite poor. This collection is the only dissapointment in John Fogerty's Creedence and solo catalogue."
3,"John Fogerty's ""Eye Of The Zombie""","This album is worth owning, since appearently physically buying the cd is the only way to acquire it(rather than by download, that i could find), i'm sure due to the legendary squabbling over the Creedence rights. Still it's worth the bother. recommend ""Change in the Weather"" for the 'groove' and the whole album for the songwriting... good, not great, but a must have for any serious Creedence or Fogerty fan. on the whole i rank it better than ""Centerfield"", personally."
2,Not As Bad As I Remember But Still Not Very Good,"Don't get me wrong - this is still a very poor effort from Fogerty but not as horrible as I remember it. The problem is that there are no good songs here - most are average at best and and some are really bad - Soda Pop, Violence is Golden, Wasn't That A Woman are terrible! Change in the Weather is the only decent song here and that is not that great -- Avoid - for completists only."
1,Dreadful,Change in the weather gave this the one star. I too am a big Creedence and Fogerty fan. A very disappointing effort after Centerfield. Just dreadful.
1,Awful,I think something bad must have happened in his life before he made this album. Very depressing.
1,80'S GLORIOUS CASIO KEYBOARD SOUND RULE'S DUUUDE! NOT!!!!!!,"LYRIC'S GOOD MUSIC, BAAAAD!!John Fogerty fall's prey to the worst of what the 'EIGHTIES' music scene had to offer!CLICHED' DRIVEL!"
3,Not Bad,"I was surprised how good this release was. Fogerty touches on several styles here, including the bouncy 70's-style blues-rocker ""Headlines"" ala Bad Company. The pumping bassline is infectious. ""Knockin' On Your Door"" is pure 60's-style soul, spiced up by a punchy horn section. ""Change in the Weather"" is a sultry blues-rocker with a funky groove. (Another version of this tune can be found on Buddy Guy's FEELS LIKE RAIN cd, where he teams up with country-rocker Travis Tritt.)Things start to slip a bit with ""Violence is Golden"", a scathing anti-war track. Although it has a biting chorus, the rest is oddly mellow & awkward. ""Wasn't That a Woman"" is just as trite as it sounds. Even worse is ""Soda Pop"", a complete waste of 5:53. ""Sail Away"" is a so-so finale.Some may be put off by the opening instrumental, ""Goin' Back Home"". The track opens with a choir-like keyboard intro, followed by a slow, bluesy guitar toward the end. Personally, I like it."
3,Good things and bad things on this one.,"At the time, it was great to hear anything by ths guy, and since I'm a big fan of his pretty much anything he puts out I'm going to like to some exent. I liked this better when this first came out, despite it's somewhat bitter tone. But it doesn't age very well for me. He tried to go for the ""modern"" sound at the time, which meant using drum machines and synthesizers. So it sounds very dated to me. There are good songs on here though; ""Change in the Weather"", ""Sail Away"" and ""Headlines"" hold up."
2,"Disappointed, Cheap looking","Very cheap looking. Items arrived broken, dented and stratched. Hard to align when putting together. The Price does not match quality of the product."
3,Dissapointed,First of all. THe people seller didnt charge my account right away and I then the package didnt arrive till 4 days after the last delivery day. So I assumed that they didnt place the order and I was going to cancel it. Then the money was taken out of my account after the last due date. Thankfully I still had it in my account. The product arrived with little chips on the corner. The product was very tricky to put together and the screw holes werent alligned that well. The finished product was more then I expected thats why it gets a 3 and not a two. Seller not great product worth it.
4,Teenage romance with realism,"This is a wonderful book and I have read it more than once. It deals with the pain of lost love, but in a healthy way. At one point in the book, when the artist is trying to teach our young heroine to relax and try to paint more naturally, he urges her: ""Don't measure for the center. . . strike for it!"" This is such good advice (when one is tempted to over-measure) that it has become a family phrase."
1,"Sorry, I have to agree with the Washington reader","Compared to Outcast, this really was a terribly written book. It felt like the author rushed to get something on paper -- forgetting that he had to write a story with some relevence. It had very little depth and situations that I've read a hundred times -- only much better.There are a lot of truly insightful and beautifully written gay novels out there (The World of Normal Boys comes to mind). Unfortunately, this one is really a waste of time."
1,Bummer,"I purchased this CD after having a successful experience with another self-help type CD. I was really excited about the title on this one, but once I heard it, I can't really get into it. The voice sounds soooooo ""un-energetic"" I can't get past a few chapters. I am going to keep giving it a try to see if I can get past it."
3,What a wierd book.,This book left me looking for books to go along with the story. I could not find any.It left a strange feeling with me.The people who wrote it seemed to forget what they were writing about.The shift from preasent-time to past-time Would loose me. Maybe that is what they wanted but not me.
5,5star book,"Not much bad to write about this one.I but I never expected the end, at least not the theperson of whom you least expect it.Even though it only took me a little over 8 hours to finish, Iwould definitely read this one again for the sake of the author ;)He did one heck of a job. Characters aren't shallow and arewell thought out. Can hardly wait to get my hands on Wolf Pack.In a nutshell, I highly recommand this one to all Battletech Fans who still don't know how the Dragoons and Draconis Combinegot set against each other."
2,Great Book but the typos are driving me nut,I was very happy to see that some of the classic battletech novels are now available for the kindle but there are at least one word per page that is hyphenated and sometimes many words. It really detracts from the enjoyment of the story. I just finished the Warrior trilogy by Stackpole which didn't have this problem. I would recommend not purchasing this until they re-edit the novel
1,crooked screen,"The picture slants down from the left to right side of the screen over an inch. This is very annoying especially when watching a letterbox DVD movie. Obviously I exchanged the TV for a new one, and the new one had the same problem. I am going to exchange for a different model now. In general I have always liked Sony TV's, They are the best. But not sure why they decided to make this model so poor."
3,"nice picture , poor interfaces","It's a nice TV , enough for daily use .but only one RF-in and one Video-audio(L&R;) in , that is too cheap . Everybody got a VCR , DVD , XBOX , Digital-TV , etc , ( not everybody ) , how to connect all the toys to this TV ?"
2,Beware Trinitron Lovers,"I did so much research into which television to buy that would suit my room. I settled on this model, and I am so sorry I did. I had to return the set 2x cause of the crooked picture and the degausser on the 2nd tv went bad. It looks tempting and I usually love the trinitron family. But BUYER BEWARE on this one. STAY AWAY! I chose to ignore the other reviews above when I got the tv and I made a big mistake. LISTEN TO US! Stay away! I hope I helped."
4,Great TV!,"I've had this TV for about 3 months now and it's great. A sharp image and nearly flat tube make this TV a joy to watch. I compared this set with the 27"" WEGA side by side in a store and frankly I didn't see enough of a difference to warrant spending the extra money for the WEGA. I'll save that money for a good DVD player!Drawbacks: Only one S-video input, no component inputs and for the first week or so the red colors were too saturated compared to the blue and green. I guess it just needed time to ""burn in"" because the colors are perfect now."
3,Quality Slipping?,"We recently purchased this tv, returned and exchanged it for another, and had to return the second set. There were two reasons for this. When started cold, both Sony's made a nasty groaning sound that literally could be heard across the house. According to the sales staff at the store, this is normal for Trinitrons. I have also seen this complaint on usenet boards.The second tv was shipped with a piece of plastic lodged between the screen and the cabinet frame, causing the plastic frame to bend outwards. I managed to shove the piece out of the way and it fell somewhere into the chasis.The tv does deliver a very good picture and sound. But, unless you are willing to live with a set that sounds like its going to blow up, I'd consider something else."
1,What a disappointment!,"My son (age 7) was so excited to use his Christmas gift certificate to get a snowboard, but we learned the first time we took it to the only place nearby with snow that it isn't a real snowboard. It was advertised as such, but the ski patrol said it was more like a sled and didn't meet the qualifications for use. It has no strap to tether the board to the user's ankle, which would keep it from shooting out and smacking someone when you fall. They also said there is something wrong with the edges. So we have wasted our money and have nothing to use this for."
3,NOT even true,Its not even a realistic snowboard. the bindings could get someone hurt! its more a sled with fake bindings then a snow board. i have been snowboarding for a whil and even on my first day i could tell u the thing is a piece of junk!!!
5,"Excellent, uplifting",I love this CD. Our wedding song was 'More Than Friends' and the CD brings back wonderful memories. Sanborn has terrific talent and I can feel the music in my soul.
4,"Nice, easy to listen to, jazz.","The tunes on this cd don't take much getting into at all, unlike some jazz that you have to listen to quite a few times to get familiar with. Although I do prefer the acoustic type jazz without synthesizers, this certainly has its place, and is certainly worth buying. Good background music for over dinner or just plain relaxing."
4,"Good, easy jazz.","It won't knock your socks off. It doesn't do anything innovative. But, it is fun to listen to. All the tracks are good."
3,Overpriced for what you get,"This book is a photo survey of the Panavia Tornado IDS. There are no technical specifications. There are no 3-views. This book only contains pictures, each with a short, accompanying descriptive paragraph. The pictures are very good for general reference. In my opinion, this is a $6-$7 book, not the $12.71 charged by Amazon."
3,SCARY? Yes. But Not THAT scary!,"First Of all the Movie is Very DARK.. You cant see anything. Why dont they use more Lighting? Second Of all the reviews I saw Of this said ""dont watch it alone"".. etc. It was scary... But not that scary and sometimes predictable. Live Tyler is GREAT in it. But a Lot of unexplained stuff. It leaves You Hanging. I totally could watch this by Myself, and be Okay. Probably was better on BIg screen- I saw it via VIDEO On Demand/TIVO. Worth the price though. Blockbuster is $4.99 to rent, and this was $3.99 and I Had it downloaded in under and hour.. and never had to leave the house. I LIKE the Video On Demand! Good Job AMAZON! I will rent more movies. !"
3,it is what it is....,"This movie was neither terrible nor fantastic to me. I enjoyed the dark scenes, the suspenseful moments, and a movie that isn't plagued with comedic slasher scenes. The strangers uses classic suspense techniques to get a scare/rise out of you. What I didn't like is it took a bit for the story to develop, at times I was really wondering where the movie was going, and the movie didn't close out well with me. It kind of leaves you hanging. All in all the movie is ok and isn't a total waste of time."
1,Raspberry Award Nomination Please!,"I saw the trailer to this film long ago and i was excited, then the film was delayed. A very bad sign.Yes this film is awful. An idea stolen from the french film Ills (Them), constructed without the key elements that made the french film so harrowing- tension, tight performances and realism.Basically, this film is about Liv Tyler's character asking- ""why"", commando crawling and knocking into every prop that makes loud noises. Her male co-star has a more complex performance that involves- pointlessly leaving his girlfriend alone more than once and saying ""run"".The Strangers has no scares or gore and the faux hand-held cinematography is the worst i have seen. This film should take the cake at the next raspberry awards.So if this sounds like 85 minuets of FUN, run and waste your $$ on another dud."
1,A total waste of time!,"This movie is so incredibly dull and boring! Watching paint dry on a wall is more exciting!At least if you own this tripe on DVD or Blu-ray, you can use your disc as a coaster!"
2,Predictable and deceiving,"Based on true events...all it is referring to is the mystery that many crimes go unsolved. They fabricated a random story to fit the fact that there are unsolved murders simply to incite interest. So...this exact thing didn't really happen like everyone wants it to have...lol Furthermore, I saw this when I went on a date and it was easily predictable. I was able to tell her what was going to happen before it happened in many, many various scenes. She kept asking me if I had already seen it. To enjoy it...try not to think about it."
3,"OK, but not great","Even though it is based on real events, it felt like a story that has been done again and again. I love Liv Tyler and Scot Speedman and expected to either like the movie more or it to be more scary. I think mostly it lacked originality."
1,Too slow to enjoy,"The Strangers was way too slow paced to scare me much. It just sort of made me sleepy: yawn. It takes too long to get to any interesting parts, you just stop caring after a while, IMO."
2,Were my expectations too high???,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, I actually did a happy little dance when I got it from netflix. Hmmmm...I should know by now every time I do this, I end up being disapointed. The plot is very simple, a couple alone in an isolated area get horrifed and then some as strangers in masks toy with them before pouncing. They made it clear there was no movtive.I thought the masks were creepy, the house creepy, and I thought Liz Tyler did a great job. Those were the only things I really liked.I felt the story was drawn out and yet too sparse. These strangers seem to have supernatural speed, and I HATE when someone falls and injures a leg in a movie. I feel it's just a cop out.I read how scary this was on the imbd boards, and I have to strongly disagree. If you want to see it, try waiting for the chep rental deals."
3,I have to disagree,"I think to sit and pick apart a horror movie scene by scene is a little too time consuming. I saw this film at my local mall and I have to say it scared the crap out of me. I must have screamed a dozen times while watching this with my friend.Yeah, it's kinda predictable and may be similar to other movies, but for Halloween it's worth the watch. The purchase to keep in your own collection? -well that's your decision."
1,1 star for atmosphere - rest of movie abysmal,"Film students/aspiring authors take note: did you ever have a great idea for a story and just couldn't think of a decent third act, so you scrapped it? Or copped out and made an ending so lame that it rendered everything that preceded it laughable? That's what The Strangers is, minus the great idea. Routine ""couple-terrorized-in-remote-location-by-motiveless-crazies"" flick...snores abound."
2,It makes a good sedative,"I'm not sure which bothered me more, the dialog gaps or the fact that I kept falling asleep. A couple times I thought the DVD froze up due to the stretches of no dialog. And the puzzling relationship between the two main characters...Maybe some time when I have insomnia, I'll watch this movie again. I'm sure that'll cure my lack of sleep.Funny, cause I wasn't even tired when I put the DVD in the player to watch the movie.Hmmm. Maybe it can be played in dentists' offices as an alternative to anesthesia."
2,wtf,"So this movie is supposedly based on a true story. And basically--I did'nt grasp that it had a real point. This movie was boring with SOME suspensful parts. The ending was wierd, and just like, wtf? I felt it was a waste and would'nt watch again."
1,Baddest idea for a horror movie,Another big disappointment from some of the dumbest American horror movies! The protagonists are so idiotic they have no clue how to defend themselves only against two girls and an old dying man with asthma. I could just think of some smart way to blow up those three lame strangers with the shotgun I keep in my bedroom! Any horror movies which can give us no satisfactory explanation as to why the bad guy(s) kill the good guys deserve loads and loads of spit. Especially nauseating are those horror films in which the bad guys don't die at the end of the movies. The creators of the movies should just kill themselves in their most rotten nightmares.
2,Beyond Lame and Horrible Sound Editing!!!,"This was like watching a B rated horror flick. The story was slow and predictable, with one idiotic response from the characters after another. What was beyond annoying was the sound editing. Lips would move and actors would react THEN the actual sound was heard!! How is it that no one noticed this before production. Inexcusable.Don't waste your time or money on this loser."
5,The Strangers,"I really enjoyed this film. It is really sad to think that this was based on a true story. They should pair this with Cabin 28: The Keddie Murders that was the incident many claim the movie was loosely based on. Great film, sit back and watch the horror!"
1,Short and boring,"In the first ten minutes, I was so bored I wanted to turn it off. Basically it had no plot really and the acting sucked (Liv Tyler, I expected better of her and Scott Speedman, too). Anyway it was really short and really stupid. Thank god I only rented it. I wouldn't even give it 1 star."
1,i am suing for wasted time.,"this was nothing more than the typical cliche hollywood horror movie. the plot was weak, and painfully predictable."
4,Great scary movie.,There aren't too many scary movies these days. This one is the real deal. At no point do you go this could never happen.
1,ZERO...,"Story? ... ZERO. PLOT? ... ZERO. Absolutely NO rhyme or reason (o explanation for anything that happens in this movie. Another fine example of ""grab a star and forget the story. A complete waste of time."
1,No stranger to THEM,What a cheap and pale rip-off of the great French thriller THEM. This will impress simple minds and those who dont understand the nuances of how to make a good and effective horror-thriller movie. Boring as was the acting medicore. Try THEM on for size.
3,Scary in parts but based on what true event??,"I found this movie to be scary in some parts and dragging in others. It was a little silly in that the main character has a shotgun and of course doesn't use it to his advantage. What I don't understand is that this movie claims to be based on real events. Well I did some research after seeing the movie and can't find anything about this occurrence. What true event is the movie based on? If someone knows, please enlighten us."
3,HIGH TENSION IN THIS CREEPY THRILLER! 3 1/2 STARS!,"My friends here on the big A, know I'm no ""stranger"" to horror and 'The Strangers' delivers some authentic shocks and keeps the tension high without using much gore! I must admit this movie kept me pretty keyed up with it's disturbing killers and creepy atmosphere. There really isn't anything new here, but it's done with a keen sense of style. Excellent sound effects and eerie looking masked maniacs round out this fast paced thriller. Of course there are the usual victims who do the wrong things and the wrong times, but it doesn't keep this one from being a jumper! The DVD has both theatrical and unrated versions of the film on it and the transfer is very good."
2,The Strangers Quiz,"Pick the statement that is false about The Strangers....1) About ten minutes of the first thirty minutes of the movie are intensely creepy; the rest of the movie is over the top and predictable.2) Movie completely collapses due to characters that do what no normal people would ever do (i.e. answer the door at 4 a.m. without first saying, ""Who is it?"" / Leave girlfriend alone at 4:10 a.m. in isolated house ""just to go for a drive"" after a ""strange"" encounter / Explore isolated house and property instead of taking a secure position after multiple ""strange"" encounters / No one immediately calls 911 when ""strange"" things start happening).3) Brazen, Manson-esque, ""strange"" trio seem to magically move from place to place.4) Scott Speedman turns into a monstroushalf vampire, half werewolfand Liv Tyler summons her true loveAragorn, and together Speedman and Aragorn defeat The Strangers.5) I am sorry that I spent 90 minutes with The Strangers."
4,Good movie,"Here's the basic plot without ruining the movie1) Couple leaves wedding (guests, not bride/groom) wondering where their relationship is headed.2) They are staying in their summer home that night.3) Bad people come to the summer home.4) Fight for survival.Overall I really enjoyed it and I was scared. Liv Tyler was fantastic. My only criticism is that the main characters employed some really terrible tactics. One of the things I like about the SAW series is that they are in a super tough situation and even a pretty smart guy would have a hard time surviving. This movie is closer to the typical horror film in that the main characters get themselves into trouble by splitting up, leaving safe places, etc."
3,This Thriller Takes a Wrong Turn,"Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are an unmarried couple with problems who, after she refuses his marriage proposal, seem to be heading for a break-up. Following a friend's wedding, they spend the night at Speedman's family's summer home, but soon after arriving they are terrorized by three masked strangers, apparently intent on killing them.This thriller from writer-director Bryan Bertino grabs your attention from the start and keeps you perched on the edge-of-you-seat, biting your fingernails right up until the final 10-15 minutes when it takes a wrong turn, not only forgetting one of the basic rules of good storytelling, but also giving us a downer ending.[I thought downer endings for this kind of picture went out in the 1970s.]The DVD contains both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie, plus deleted scenes.Michael B. Druxman"
3,it is what it is.....,"This movie was neither terrible nor fantastic to me. I enjoyed the dark scenes, the suspenseful moments, and a movie that isn't plagued with comedic slasher scenes. The strangers uses classic suspense techniques to get a scare/rise out of you. What I didn't like is it took a bit for the story to develop, at times I was really wondering where the movie was going, and the movie didn't close out well with me. It kind of leaves you hanging. All in all the movie is ok and isn't a total waste of time."
4,Those masks were friggin scary!,"K...maybe I'm just a wimp but I found this movie really scary. Sure, the 'based on real events' thing was pretty lame...but who ever really believes that anyway? And the fact that they had a gun and didn't hang onto it after ...you know...was really friggin dumb...but it's a horror movie. The people being killed always do stupid things in horror movies.I thought it was pretty good. I'm picky about horror movies and it takes quite a bit to scare me but this one really gave me the creeps."
2,this movie was BORING!!!!!! but kinda creepy....,"THE STRANGERS is not a bad movie.... at all... it was just long boring and took way to long to get to the point.... liv tyler is an AMAZING actress and all but her role in this movie was very lackluster and kinda ditzy (u have a cell phone!!!!)the movie had a real feel to it and the ""strangers"" were really wierd and got under your skin... the directer did a great job doing that... i just wish the couple was a little bit more EXPRESSIVE, if i may....THE STRANGERS is a ok movie and wouldnt b in my collection of horror flicks in my opinion....2 stars out of 5: boring....."
1,Horiible flick for a buck,"A buddy and I saw this movie for a dollar at the local dollar theater and it wasn't even worth a buck. horrible acting, bad storyline, you could tell when the next fright was, and an ending that worse than showgirls. HORRIBLE."
1,Wasted Potential,I rented this from my library for $1.25. Whoever made it owes me $1.25 and an apology.
1,Was this movie suppose to be scary?,"I remember watching this movie with some friends the weekend it came out. And well, I found myself laughing throughout this entire movie. I annoyed my friends and probably everyone else in the theater, but I found this movie laughable."
1,Are you serious?,"This film is so bad it's scary. But actually it's not. There are cheap jump scares but that's it. No story whatsoever. The first 20 minutes of this thing are simply boring as hell. Once the ""scary"" stuff begins you'll just find yourself face palming over and over at how stupid the director of this film thinks his audience is. The characters response to whats happening to them is simply laughable. I am almost tempted to think this movie was made as a joke just to see how dumb moviegoers are these days. Absolutley awful."
4,Better than I Thought,"I had heard some bad reviews about this movie before I brought it, but I got it anyway because not everyone has the same taste. I must say that I am not disappointed with this movie. It's soo creepy and scary. The fact that it's based on true events just adds to the creepiness of it. Overall I think that it was a good movie and I'm glad that I brought it."
3,Very good - even for the squeamish,"I used to love torture films - Hostel, texas massacre, etc. However, my tastes have certainly changed and I no longer really enjoy the movie with otherwise innocent people being tormented. There is something about the reality and real-world possibility of it that makes me uncomfortable; all one has to do is scan the newspapers to realize that these types of things do happen, and could happen to you. So rather than being entertaining, I sometimes seem these types of flicks as a vicarious experience of something I don't want to experience. This movie is a little different though. For some inexplicable reason, there is a tiny enough separation between the reality of torment and what these people go through. That being the case, I was able to enjoy this as a piece of entertainment, rather than an expose on what could be. And the story is good, and it moves quickly without any real dead spots. Good stuff."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!ZZ!!zzzzzz,"B to the O to the R to the I to the N to the G !!!!!!!! dont waste your time sucked horribly.....put it on ..my face didnt even look at the screen,, it sucked so bad..john norris"
2,NOT SCARY,"After watching the trailers of this movie, I was exicited. Now, after watching this movie I felt that I must warn others of the future. Rent it. Not so scary movie. There was no motive for these family of killers other that knocking on the door and seeing if someone greets them at 4am. I don't even think the actors act or talk at all. This movie has left me dumb and just thinking of it, is unbearable."
1,"waste of money,plastic,film and time....","This was the worst attempt at a horror movie that I have seen in a long time.The writer should be ashamed,Universal should never have released this garbage.20 minutes into this movie had me wanting to throw something at the TV.Do yourself a favor and get a bootleg copy if you HAVE to see this crap. I don't condone bootleg downloads ever but, in this case the makers of this movie do not deserve ant more money that they have already stolen from us.In short the Strangers sucked,the killers were able to appear and then vanish in the blink of an eye and the only thing that even came close to bothering me was the guys mask.Do not waste your time... oh, I hears there is going to be a strangers two in 2010... do we really need a sequelto this incredibly bad attempt at a horror film??? This would have been scary to me if I was 9 or 10 years old...pure crap."
1,Unbelievably Boring,"Oh please people, 4 stars? What's the plot here? A couple are in a house and some people in masks kill them. The end.I don't know how anyone can call this a film at all, it's like something some college kids threw together. Make that high school kids."
2,"""Inspired by True Events""...like Cain and Abel.","I've become very suspicious of films that bear the subtitle, ""Inspired by True Events."" ""Inspired"" just means that something caused someone to come up with something. It doesn't mean they have to use any elements of what inspired them...they were just inspired by some incident.So the murder behind Cain and Abel in Genesis could've ""inspired"" THE STRANGERS: somebody did something bad to somebody else.And not that you ever find out why or who the bad guys really are or why we're submitting ourselves to this ordeal. Call me fussy, but I like to know what's going on in my movies. I like to know why people do what they do.This isn't a terrible movie. It's well-crafted...but I knew as much at the end as I did when I started it. It's all style, no substance. I was thankful it wasn't a by-the-numbers slasher flick (because I do despise those tedious exercises more) but was it too much to ask for some insight or info or anything about what was going on here?"
2,Hollywood Horror,"The movie is long on atmospherics--borrowed from better, less compromised non-Hollywood movies like Wolf Creek and High Tension--and short on credible behavior. Admittedly, the first third provides a promising, suspenseful set-up. However, it all goes to waste thanks to undermotivated characters and contrived action. This is one of those movies where the victims' implausibly stupid behavior is the only thing that keeps them from escaping before the third act. Even worse, the killers lazily toy with the victims instead of offing them when the opportunity arises. And there is a preposterous denouement that makes the film even less satisfying. Finally, nothing else about the film is interesting enough to compensate for the storytelling flaws."
1,morbid waste of film stock!,"I actually give this film 'half' a star but that option isn't provided.I'm not going to waste time giving details on the storyline.It's your typical 'young couple get terrorized by Manson type masked freaks/ slasher thriller. It started out fine, and I invested my interest into the survival of the lead characters. Only, there is no pay off. After two hours of watching these poor kids get tortured psychologicaly, they get hacked up! I'm sure the director would defend this ending by saying it was inspired by true events. To that I say.....Many of us watch movies to escape from the real world, not to be reminded how F***ED up it is! If I wanted to bring myself down, I'd open a newspaper!This is a similair review I gave to OPEN WATER. Also inspired by true events."
3,3 of 5,"You're not always safe at home. That's the lesson here. It's a simple story about home invasion as a trio of masked killers visit the summer house of James and Kristen; a couple romantically involved but very much unmarried. It's almost morning but still dark out. If there are neighbors within screaming range, they're probably sound asleep. So it's a terrific setting for a horror movie. The horror begins interestingly enough, but it stalls itself all the way to the end. The killers seem to realize they're in a horror movie, in other words, so they play around with their victims, appearing then disappearing suddenly, sometimes magically, in what seems like a collaborative effort to stall time. It's an effective technique at first. Loud door-knocks are scary at night. But the threat wears thin after a while.marcellee.com"
3,Crazy/Creepy,"Just trust me! I won't casually open the door to anyone at 4 A.M.! This movie was not too bad but it lacked some common sense when it comes to protecting oneself! The setting is eerie/creepy. The acting lacks a bit! I didn't really care for the way it ended!In terms of picture quality and sound, both were excellent!"
4,SPOOKY film,"I do not know why but I have always liked this film. It is based on a true story, well a bunch of true incidents. If you are a fan of horror check this one out and you might be pleased."
1,Boring & Stupid,"SPOILER ALERT!!! This movie is horrible. The acting sucks. The characters do the dumbest things. Towards the end, I am hoping the killers kill the couple b/c they are so dumb (esp. the guy). Don't waste your time watching this flop."
2,Liv Tyler good; movie bad,"This was a great idea gone to pot. Guns, do not a suspense movie make. Predictable and goofy. Men are not this stupid without a motive (usually women). Any man could be stupid for Liv Tyler any day, but that theme really didn't come out at all. Good concept, poor execution."
1,don't waste your money,Life is too short to waste time watching this movie. I'd rather be mowing the lawn or getting a cavity filled.
4,"""Are you a sinner?""","The Strangers starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman is a creepy and effective horror flick. I actually enjoyed this film but I wish more character development was used more, both actors are believable and strong from beginning to end. I liked the music, it gives the movie a comical feel. Give this freaky under-rated treat a chance, enjoy!"
4,Needs to be seen with good surround sound system,"I don't know why I never noticed it, but Liv Tyler is so beautiful in this movie. She is hot.. anyways this is a good HD movie experience. And it scares the hell out of females... so if you are a guy, with a good speaker system, watch this with a girl and she will be all over you! Good movie. I can understand why people don't like it though. I saw this in theaters. And when I just watched it on blu ray by myself I was kinda just waiting for it to be over. But there's no doubt that it is scary when watching alone. And I don't get scared from movies. I live in a dorm room so its not that scary cause that's not gonna happen here. I can't even imagine being a girl, home alone and watching this movie in an actual house. Im willing to bet that it is something that has never been done before!"
1,lazy film making,"There was absolutely no suspense in this movie, which is quite something considering the subject. I was not scared once."
2,LIV TYLER FALLS FROM GRACE,"Liv Tyler has come a long way down since LOTR. After they paid for her to be in this film, they didn't have any money to pay the electric bill as most of the movie is shot in the dark. Scott proposes to Liv and has a nice evening set in a secluded home (one nicer looking than my dump). The only problem for Scott is that Liv said ""No,"" she is not ready, but she is still his gf and sex is still on the table.Rather than be happy, like most males, Scott mopes about and plays lousy tear jerkers. At this point I am hoping the intruders would come in and kill him, but they don't. The movie drags on. Scott leaves Liv, who is now subjected to people banging on the outside walls as we get to see her slither around in the dark all in a panic...no phone, no gun, just a kitchen knife. This is the intense horror that I didn't feel.Not the best home invasion film out there.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, near sex, back nudity."
1,simple basic and just bad,"This is painful to watch, terrible sets, a soundtrack that makes you want to drink . The plot is predictable and moves at a glacial pace."
1,not worth my time,"Saw the previews and even the cover made me really want to buy it,, but after I went out and bought it was a big disapointment ,,you know those horror movies where the girl picks the darkest and scariest room to hide in and just happens to be where the killer is hiding and she gets it,, well kind of like this movie. I think they could of done so much better, the idea of the movie was good,, but the strangers appear and disapear scaring this girl to death, they sneak in move things and disapear again before any knows they are in the house and the girl frantically runs and crawls around screaming and crying while the ""strangers"" are hiding un seen watching her every move,, feel it is a very predicable movie- and I got more bored through it because you know what is going to happen and it is only a matter of time -- wouldn't waste my time watching it again"
5,The Strangers,"Product was delivered on time, in mint condition and packaged nicely. Wrapping was still on the DVD. I love this movie and am thrilled to have a good-looking copy of it!"
2,Brutally disgusting,"This movie is based on true events. I think people forget that, when they see this movie. A young couple is attacked in their cabin. This couple, is attacked by people with sheets over their faces, out of nowwhere. The things this couple goes through is stuff that people like Dalmer, would do. What is worse, is what the actress portrayed in the movie. She was beat, raped, and had to see her boyfriend die. I didn't like that. Unfortunately, it is still unknown who commited this gruesome crime to this couple."
3,Scary but copying VACANCY,"The Strangers started off terrifying throughout the beginning and the middle, with the elements of being stalked at night with 3 killers. That's scary, but trust me towards the end, the film lost it's horror element. Don't see this film if you loved VACANCY, because this was supposed to be absolutely terrifying."
2,A couple good scares out of this...,"Basically this movie is summed up in the sentence ""Hero and heroine get slowly stabbed to death at the end of a long, boring movie."""
2,"Disappointing, to say the least..........","I had been waiting anxiously to watch this, since it was released at the theatres, and never got a chance to go. Finally, I was able to rent it, and.......... wow. Bummer. It felt like I kept waiting for something to happen. Very disappointing, in my opinion."
5,The Best Horror Movie of the New Millenium!!!!,"I went to see The Strangers on the weekend that it opened, and this movie made me jump more than any other movie that I have seen. It is a movie that will scare you physically, and mentally. Since this movie is based on a true story, it'll make you think that someone is out there, watching you, and waiting for you to be alone, so they can go in for the kill. If you are into suspense/thrillers withan appropriate amount of gore, check this movie out."
4,"Not exactly plot-driven, but scary as hell!!!","If you want a horror movie to just freak you out, this is the one for you! I mean, there's no rhyme or reason to it - just a slasher movie - but the terror is masterful!! Do not watch this at home alone in the dark... especially if you live in the middle of nowhere!!!"
1,One of the worst movies of all time.,I love horror movies as a rule. This was utter garbage. It is a cliche after a cliche after a cliche. I can't say that there is a single thing in this movie that is even remotely original or unpredictable. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seem in my life. I would give it no stars if I could.
2,The Strangers by Brandon M. Moskos,"I was really disappointed in this film. I had a lot of people tell me how scary this movie was, so I bought the dvd. The movie was weak, the story sucked, and I wasn't scared at all. I'm not going to even explain the story, because it was so cliched. People with bags over their heads should not scare anyone except for kids. I recommend renting and not buying."
2,The Stupids,"Starts off very slowly, builds tension, then our heroes make some really stupid moves, but recover and gain the upper hand. Then they inexplicably lose the upper hand by making more stupid moves. HINT: If you have a shotgun and masked opponents have only hand tools, they are the prey. Put them down, fast. Sheesh."
5,Great horror movie!,"I went to the theatre to see this movie, and I found myself constantly jumping. The acting is great. The lighting and music are scary. The pace is perfect. The ""strangers"" are terrifying. I bought this dvd as soon as it came out. It was definitely worth the $20 I spent for it."
2,Just Watch The Trailer...,"As others have mentioned, the trailer for this film was very strong & scrary. Unfortunately for the viewer, the ""BAM!"" w/ loud noise effect wears thin half-way into the movie. Most everything that happens is predicable, but I was give it props for the antagonists of the film. They basically terrorize a couple instead of just killing them like most horror films (not that they die for you 1st time viewers.) Maybe they do & maybe they don't - I don't even know... & I saw the movie. The last 5 minutes plays like they forgot to write an ending at all & had to stay on budget..."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This should be a first instrument for a child or simply for decoration. It looks far more interesting than it sounds. The skin is very, VERY thin and see-through, the jingles are also thin and do not sound nice. That said, it is exactly what I expected for a riq that was under $20."

4,Work great; no sticking or jamming,These galvanized roofing nails really did the trick on my roof. They fit exactly in the gun and fired cleanly into the roof.
5,Jus Family brings the REAL western conference starz,"Cool Nutz with the help of producer/lyricist Bosko put together a compilation of the best of the northwest for this album. If you live in the west, or listen to the west coast, purchase this double disk, it wont ever leave your rotation. Wit cuts featuring Lifesavas, G-ism, Jumbo, Pete Miser, Bosko, Grass Rootz, Maniac, and the portland legend Cool Nutz himself, the chance of disapointment are Bleek, who is also featured on the album. So dont wait, purchase this."
5,Brazils best kept secret is a Winner!,"Daniela does it again with Sol Da Liberdade! Her music is hypnotic, energetic and I don't even speak the language. See her live at the Hollybowl on Sept 10 and you'll see why she is Brazil ""Queen of Samba Regae"""
5,FANTASTIC,Anyone who knows Daniela Mercury will not be disappointed. Excellent doesn't describe this CD. A MUST BUY! -
5,Very Comprehensive,I used this book for a class and it took me from not knowing a thing about Access to being able to create my own fully functional databases!
2,Not nearly as good as the first.,"My four year old daughter loves Doctor Desoto! It is charming to think of a world of a gentle mouse dentist with his loving wife and delicate tools. She was thrilled when we discovered this sequel. But, it was hard to read, hard to follow and an overall disappointment."
2,Not doin' So Good,"In the context of his best (and later work), even with a young Freddie Hubbard, this is an uninspiring rendition of the musical giant that Dexter is. I am a lover of and collector of his music, and this one goes to the bottom of the heap.I read the lavish reviews of others and then listened to the CD again in order to make sure I was not missing something. I wasn't: This CD is a plain vanilla version of the Dexter Gordon I know. Gordon is a ""heavyweight."" But here he is obviously ""coasting"" through an obligatory recording session. And the music ""tells.""Gordon purist, save your money. Two stars."
1,plueger fail,This reel was to be a replacement / spare for a fishing trip. It was assembled backwards [lefthand] and required a small screwdriver [not included] to fix. The drag broke within an hour and the reel was wobbling and scraping it's housing before two hours were up. Very noisy drag with noisy reel. It held the line in a spool and thats about it. Spend $50 and get one a lot nicer.
5,Customer Mistake,"I ordered these by mistake,paslode impulse only takes 3.250 length.I have since returned them prepaid but however I have not seen a credit on my credit card statement and it has been a couple of weeks. What's up with that?"
5,The nails were great,"The shipper has some folks who are kinda rough on the packages they handle ( fedex ). One package was broken open, and had to be replaced."
4,Great Book for Plus Size Women,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this book is like ""What Not to Wear"" for full-figured women. The HOAX system of body-typing is really helpful in determining which clothes are most flattering to a particular figure. The only complaint that I have is that the book does not specify the body type of the models used. Other than that, I highly recommend it."
4,Great!,"I bought this in the dollar bin and I am an aspiring fashion designer. It gave great advice, but ""a REAL woman wouldn't x,"" in implication that a -real- woman was plus size, got borderline offensive. My small frame of 5'1"" and 105 lbs due to having an autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's). I love big ladies. I loved this book's advice, but I don't appreciate snide remarks against slender women. It wasn't any different than a skinny-minny book making snide remarks against big women (who might not be able to help it due to hypothyroidism).I've read a lot of fashion books like this one. This is unique in itself and I appreciated that. It had many photos which got their point across. As a fashion book, it was good!"
2,Figure it out for yourself,"Wow, this book was incredibly bad. As usual, ""plus-sized"" models are beautiful women who are not very far away from being ""normal-sized"" (normal-sized?) women. Even the supposedly ""bad"" styles look good on them. The photographers and writers must've figured this out fast, so models wearing ""bad"" clothes also wear ""sad"" or ""confused"" or ""pissed off"" or ""flippant"" expressions. I guess this is to help the reader understand that since the model is ""sad"" wearing her clothes, she didn't ""figure it out"", as the title implies. ""Oooo... look at my face... see how my face says ""yo' mutha""? That means this skirt will look crappy on you!"" Gah, what a waste of paper."
4,Decent for a cheap product,"It is not a bad product. The frame looks decent. The nuts and bolts are plastic, they seem pretty durable and definitely will not rust. Unfortunately the nuts and bolts did not fit my car. I own a 2012 Subaru Impreza sedan and I did have to buy two rustproof screws to mount the plate and frame (I already had two that came with my car). The screw cover caps are a little loose and the sub on my trunk make them rattle just a bit, which is the reason for four stars."
4,"Great insulator, very durable!","I wrapped the exhaust pipes on my Harley to give it a more 'old school' look, and take off the bulk of the metal heat-shields that came with my aftermarket pipes.Let me just say a few things:1) The pipes were no hotter than with the heat shields, so the wrap definitely did the job.2) I live in S. Florida, and the wrap stood up to rain (and subsequently the roadgrime that gets kicked up with the water) and to this day looks and acts protectively.The only issue was that some rubber from my boot melted onto the pipe, and ultimately ate through the wrap as it continued to heat up/melt. But only in that one spot, so the rest is still holding up great, almost two years later.I'd recommend buying a high temp. spray sealer to treat/seal the wraps after installation, and the metal DEI 'zip ties' to secure them. They work well!"
3,Spanish for Dummies,"I really haven't looked at it page by page, but for what I wanted it for, it doesn't seem like it is going to help"
4,Habla Espanol?,Really gives you a better understanding of the Spanish Language & how to communicate a little better if you have no experience.
2,waste,if you want to learn colors abcs how to say hello and goodbye this is a great product for 2nd graders.
2,dumb is right,"the cd that comes with it is way to advance, does not teach at all. Talks in spanish and unless you know spanish you have no ideal what they are saying. Book, lost interest soon."
4,Buying this book doesn't make you a dummy,"I don't care for the series ""For Dummies,"" but I got this one anyway...and was pleasantly surprised! As a Spanish teacher, I think this book does a pretty good job introducing the language, formatting that's pleasant to the eye, and of course, grammar explanation. If you are truly teaching yourself, this is a GREAT place to start. It's conducive to skipping around if you get too bored with a particular lesson, and you can supplement with information when you need a little more practice.For the money, this is a great adult-centered teaching guide.For the much younger student, it's of course, WAY too intense, and not near ""fun"" enough to keep interest.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
4,Useful,Was Helpful for me to better my words and to open more job skills in the work place so yes give it a try
2,Mainly a crash course,"This book is only for those who might be going on vacation in a Spanish speaking country and only want to know a few words and phrases.It covers beginner topics like: vocabulary for food, asking how someone is and their name, talking on the phone, and asking directions.It very briefly covers some grammar: the difference between ser and estar, simple present and simple past tense, the [(ir) + a + (infinitive)] future tense, and reflexive verbs. It doesn't cover any other tenses.The speakers in the audio portions speak slowly. It is only for a very beginner of the language."
3,A good primer,"Spanish for Dummies is a quick study that gets you going and keeps you pretty motivated as a result of its organization of practical, grammatical, syntactical and vocabulatary elements. I like the way it introduces tenses without it seeming to be punishment. I have taken many years worth of Spanish over the years and this was the most fun. Muy bueno!"
3,Good but not the best,"I would only get this book if you can obtain it at a discount. It is decent, but by no means the best Spanish guide available. One thing that really annoys me is that the author gets some of the dipthongs,ue and ei for example, wrong. (She prounces bueno as bvoo-eno, which is obviously incorrect.)To her credit, she does do a good job with some things--the chapter on Spanish dates and times is excellent. Again, ok but not the best beginners' book out there."
4,excellent service and great book,This book is great and thank you for being honest. I would like like to thank you for your prompt service in sending the book so quickly.
3,Mediocre book,"The book is average at best. It's cheap for a reason. I have learnt MUCH more thru the ""Coffee Break spanish podcast on iTunes"". bought this as a companion book. As a companion this book is OK. But if i had bought it as just the primary then i would have been very disappointed. So use it along with other audio material and you will be fine.. Have not listened to the included CD."
3,spanish for dummies,"The book is good and the service was fast. However, the book was supposed to have a CD and that was missing. The seller refunded my money."
1,Another disappointing Spanish Book,"Yet another disappointment. This is not suited to self-study, very few exercises and no answers!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!"
3,A single book is not sufficient to study a language,"As another reviewer wrote - one has to hear the pronounciation, which is why I recommend buying this book with the ""BMV Quantum Subliminal CD: Learn Spanish Language"""
4,Good way to learn another language,"I grew up wanting to learn how to speak Spanish. This was the first book I bought (from Amazon, too) to help me learn. It comes with a CD that lets you hear how to say each word. It's helped me a lot but I have much more to learn. I think it's a great way for beginners, like me, to learn a foreign language."
4,Spanish for Dummies - A good refresher for previous students,"This is an excellent book, very user friendly. It does a good job explaining things in an easily understood manner. It is loaded with dialogs and is interesting. The written part is the best of the 5 or 6 Spanish books I have purchased.The CD, on the other hand, is a bit of a disappointment as it is only in Spanish. It doesn't help me much until I have memorized all the dialog and know what they are saying. I have a Spanish speaking girlfriend. She and I are now recording the dialogs ourselves, so I give a line in Engish, then she repeats it in Spanish. Then she and I both listen to the tapes. We both think the written dialogs from the book are excellent, but the tapes are only helpful once it has both languages."
3,Spanish for Real Dummies,This book is good but I purchased it because I thought it would be very basic for beginners. The CD is for people with advanced knowledge of Spanish.
4,Easy to use and comprehensive.,"This book covers all subjects related to stress including:-recognizing the signs and symptoms of stress.-Instant solutions such as deep breathing, aromatherapy,and massage.-time management-productive, positive thinking-exercise and diet-natural techniques such as osteopathy, visualization, andherbs and homeopathy.A sixty minute CD is included with the book and it really does help in the visualization, relaxation, and meditation techniques covered in the book.This book is not expensive, and will give you some good information for starting to ease stress out of your life. I plan to go further now and purchase some books that cover each of these topics individualy in more depth."
5,A genius at work,"I am not a musician and cannot carry a tune. I love all kinds of music and always felt Paul Simon was a musical/lyrical genius. I had never listened to the entire Graceland album until I purchased this CD/DVD combo and also the DVD copy of ""Graceland: The African Concert. What led me to this sudden cash outlay was the recent airing on cable TV of ""Under African Skies"" and recently seeing a live performance of Ladysmith Black Mambazo at a local theater.I firmly believe one should listen to cut 17 on the CD, The Story of ""Graceland"" as told by Paul Simon, before listening to ""Graceland"" or viewing the DVD. I have listened to cut 17 three times and wish I had studied music when I had the opportunity so I can have a better understanding of Paul Simon's narration. I give it 5 stars because the entire package deserves the highest rating."
4,"The music is good, the sound of the record....naah!","The mastering on this album leaves much to be desired. It is beautifully presented and there are wide gaps of silence between song bands so it resembles an old RCA Victor orange label LP from the 70s. You have to crank up the volume in order to hear the music, which apparently has been mastered at a very low volume in order to preserve dynamic range and avoid compression. They should have realized vinyl COULD have tolerated a louder cutting volume and sill preserve the original dynamic range.. A pity."
5,One of my favorite recordings,"One of the greatest pop records ever. So well done. In the top five of all the albums I have. Been played through vinyl, cassette & a couple c.d.'s. A must have. Thank you Mr. Simon for giving us something so great."
5,The Original Release -- Excellent!,"I wore my original cassette of this album out and always meant to buy the CD. After reading reviews of the anniversary release, I opted for the original, because I've always loved all of the subtle effects in these songs and was wary of them being submerged in the new louder version. Great decision! I've fallen in love with the album all over again. (Shipping was prompt and the album arrived exactly as described.)"
5,PROBABLY ONE THE BEST CD's TO DRIVE TO EVER!,"it's just awesome to drive too, put it on in your car and make sure there's not a lot of traffic you'll see what i mean!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Amazing,"This album is the best album that has ever been made. Yes, that is correct. What is ""Graceland""? Musical Euphoria. This is no exaggeration. Everyone should listen to this, you will love it."
4,"Paul Simon, world music impresario","Tellingly, the tracks that I skip over most are the ones which have too much of Simon's stamp on them - 'Boy in the Bubble', 'Crazy Love', 'Myth of Fingerprints' (both of these latter tracks are frankly mediocre). It's in places where the musical setting is heavily borrowed that the album is excellent: the zydeco charm of 'That Was Your Mother', the heavy African flavour of 'I Know What I Know' and 'Homeless'. Lyrically, Simon has had better days, but he does creditably on tracks like 'Graceland' and 'You Can Call Me Al'. If there's one thing this album achieved, it was the opening of the ears of much of the world to sounds they had never heard before; and if bringing 'world music' (what an ugly term) into the mainstream was the saving grace of Graceland - well, that's not a bad achievement. I'd also recommend the less radio-friendly but equally strong 'Rhythm of the Saints'."
3,Can I get the album title in English next time?,"CD is fine, but, my computer/Itunes recognizes/shows the album title in Japanese!! It won't recognize any of the individual song titles - kind of a pain in this day and age. But, the CD works fine; Paul is still singing in English."
5,"Unique, Timeless Pop Masterpiece","I had the good fortune of hearing a handful of these songs live a week ago or so, and I was elated, just totally getting my grove on to ""Boy in the Bubble"" and ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"". Anyway I am slightly biased in my rating on this album; It was the first CD my dad ever bought some 13 or 14 years ago, and was a poolside favorite with my family. When I moved out, I just had to steal it! And then a year or so ago I carelessly stepped on the damn thing, cracking it in half. No matter, I just got a used vinyl copy today! Anyway, I would probably say this would be in my Top 10 albums of all time and I will be enjoying it until the day I die."
4,Excellent,Paul Simon at his best. I had not played this for years. It was great hearing it again. The additional information on this CD was fantastic. Defintely pick it up!
5,Classic with extras,Classic CD with bonus tracks. The remix of Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes is simply fantastic.
3,Share the Royalties!!,"A great album and deserving of much praise to be sure, but as a Los Lobos fan, I must penalize Paul a couple stars for not giving the band any writing credit and subsequent royalties for ""The Myth of Fingerprints"". He copped the riffs David Hidalgo showed him in the studio and ran away with it. Considering the amount of records he sold, including this reissue, this is no small matter. True story! Google it."
4,Good but not what I was expecting,"As a long time fan (since the 60's) of Simon and Garfunkel, I have all of their albums and most of their subsequent solo albums. I bought this one on the recommendation of a friend. It is great but not the Paul Simon of Kodachrome fame that I had come to appreciate."
5,my desert island cd too,"I am normally a bit wary of mainstream recognition, but if there were an album that truly deserved all the accolades given, this is it. Graceland was the first album I owned and the first album that I remember hearing in its wonderful entirety (I was only 5 when it was released). It's one of those must-own albums that any respectable music collection should contain, regardless of the type of music one normally listens to. I currently own it on CD, cassette, and vinyl - incidentally, if you haven't heard it on vinyl before I highly suggest it; 18 years later I'm still hearing nuances of the music I hadn't noticed before. Basically, I agree with the commentor who said this would be their desert-island album."
5,best album of the 80's,"Well this was a sort of transitional period in Paul Simon's music. As ""Hearts and Bones"" was his foray into 80's new wave, this album shows him straying from the 80's sound and going into world music (with a little Zydeco thrown in). The 80's sound is still present (You Can Call Me Al, as well as recurring synth drums) but it will be completely gone by the time he records Rhythm of the Saints.So what makes this album so much more celebrated then his other 80's albums? Well, the songs are flawless. ""Crazy Love, Vol. II"" is probably the worst song on the album IMO, but it's still great. It's a fairly personal album as well, expanding on his divorce with the song ""Graceland"". Add in some humorous songs and life-affirming pop and you have possibly the best album in the 80's."
5,Graceland,"This product contains both a CD and a DVD. The DVD, ""Under African Skies"" is an inspiring film at the 25th anniversary of the recording of Graceland. It expands the depth of Paul Simon's genius. I have watched it twice and will watch it again. A fabulous deal!"
5,Graceland CD,"I recently rediscovered Graceland on cassette tape. I wanted it on cd. Using Amazon to locate the item and make the purchase was easy. Graceland arrived within the prescribed timeframe and wellpackaged. I've been enjoying the cuts that did not appear on the cassette and I love it all the more. the music is JOYOUS! Thanks, Amazon! Jennifer"
3,"DVD is brilliant, original material aweseome, CD Remaster leaves something to be desired","As probably seen in other reviews, the remaster of this product was not done very well. The compress and loudness adjustments make the album rough to listen to. Seems very harsh, with super-high/loud treble. Keep your 1980s copy of Graceland handy, because you will appreciate it. Better yet, listen to the vinyl. :)The DVD is really the main value of this item. I am so happy to see all the band members back together, hanging out with Paul. I was too young in 86 to know all the background on the album. All that chatter had died down by the time I was in college in the 90s.The price is right if you are looking to get the documentary."
1,SKIPS,"This is the second Graceland vinyl I've purchased and returned. They both arrived brand-new in the factory plastic packaging and both skipped horribly throughout many of the songs. I've ordered one more replacement--if the third one also skips, I give up. Seems like a manufacturing problem."
5,Great music,"When I first heard ""Graceland"" upon its release, I panned it, and really thought it was overrated. Well, it's a number of years later, and I finally ""get"" it. Now it gets regular play in my playlist, and I can't believe I didn't love it before! Maybe it was musical maturity, but this is truly a work before its time. Great!"
4,Still one of the greatest.,"This recording would have made it to the top five if it wasn't for (I KNOW WHAT I KNOW) and (UNDER AFICAN SKIES) both that dont deserves to be on this project. and maybe also (YOU CAN CALL ME AL) but the rest of them are above excellent, like (THE BOY IN THE BUBBLE) (GRACELAND) (GUMBOOTS) (DIAMONDS ON THE SOLES OF HER SHOES) (HOMELESS) by far the best song here with ladysmith black mabazo. (CRAZY LOVE VOL2) (THAT WAS YOUR MOTHER) and lastly, (ALL AROUND THE WORLD OR THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS) this recording is still a heck of a lot better than, the rythem or the saints or his latest the capeman,which nothing could be worse then that by him. Do us a favor paul keep your dayjob."
3,"For the real thing, check out Johnny Clegg","White man covers black music and gets huge hit from it. Sound familiar? If you want to listen to the real thing, check out any of the multitude of recordings by Juluka, Savuka, or Johnny Clegg. They even used Juluka's producer Hilton Rosenthal to put the album together.I'll tip my hat to Simon for helping to popularize the music of south africa, but that's it. It's still Johnny Clegg for me and it always will be."
3,Wonderful stuff if...,"Marvelous compositions and performances!! Unfortunately, the heavy handed production and the bitter after taste of '80's fx (like the heavy gated drum reverb on Call Me Al) really detracts from the genuine beauty of the music. If you can get past that, the tunes, lyrics and players are all great!"
3,Too much talk - not enough music,"Very disappointed that the film associated with this CD release consists mostly of blather about artistic freedom and very little music. It's the MUSIC that matters! And we get very, very little of that. I was hoping for a re-release of The African Concert, a milestone in pop music history. This package is a real letdown."
5,An eclectic tour de force!!!!,"I had always heard a lot about this album before I listened to it. It won the Grammy and sold over four million copies. Entertainment Weekly rated it as the 4th best album of all time. It's as good as everybody says it is. If it isn't in your CD collection, you've got a serious problem. From the abstract brilliance of ""The Boy in the Bubble"" to the poetic beauty of ""Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes,"" Simon delivers an eclectic tour de force. The mixing of American pop with African samba and New Orleans zydeco is absolutely spellbinding. ""Graceland"" is the most successful musical experiment since ""Sgt. Pepper's."" And the music is as fresh as it was in 1986. Simon never reached to the artistic heights of ""Graceland"" again. But let's all thank God he once had it in him."
4,STUNNING,"I'm strongly inclined towards rock, especially metal. After I passed the 30 years of age barrier, I began to search for some new grounds, musically speaking. That's why only now I heard this master-piece, released in 1986. What an album !! I think most of the reviews below are useless, trying to ""analyse the songs"", the "" micture of rhythms"", whatever. The album is just plain amazing, independent of the style or who wrote it. DOn't analyse the album: just listen to it."
5,A masterpiece,"So much has been put into this album -- so much thought, melodies, harmonies and rhythms, instrumentation, fusion of different cultures, creativity, lyrics, ideas, atmosphere, complex and rich overlay of sounds. I marvel at the fact that someone could create this album."
1,missing cd order,"Order still not received - ordered one month ago, emailed sender one week ago and still no resolution to the problem."
3,The bombastic production leaves much to be desired.,"As was the case with most post-1983 R&B albums, James Ingram's ""Never Felt So Good"" features overblown and bombastic production. Yes, the club-friendly dance tracks sounded impressive back in 1986 but lack the soulfulness found on Ingram's 1983-issued ""It's Your Night"" album. The gorgeous ballads ""The Wings Of My Heart"", ""Love's Been here And Gone"", ""Crazy"" and the mid-tempo groover ""Always"" are fine vehicles for Mr. Ingram's powerful and soulful vocals but the other tracks are unredeemed and remain mediocre at very best."
2,NCLEX-PN,"I'm very disappointed with the CD-ROM. The selections of answer for the question do not appear. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING! since I'm just using the NCLEX-PN. So, how can one prepare effectively with your NCLEX-RN. As for the book itself, it's ok coz somehow it helped me in clarifying the work of an RN and an LPN. DO INFORM YOUR MANAFUCTURER OR WHO EVER MADE THE DISK TO CHECK IT THOROUGHLY FOR ERRORS!"
2,Probably a waste of money.,"Not so sure this is great stuff. I gave it to my 9 year old arthritic Leonberger, and it made her sleepy and VERY grouchy. She didn't even want to take it and I gave it to her anyway. Normally I give her a potato bread sandwich with Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM, Vitamin C, Turmeric and blackstrap molasses, which she loves and which quite obviously helps her feel lots better and quite perky. I only gave her this because I was running late and didn't have time to make her sandwich. I'll put it in the First Aid Kit, but we won't be using it every day."
3,Have to force my dog to take these,"He doesn't like them, they don't seem to help as much as other joint formulas we've tried. Glucosamine seemed to help more."
2,Didn't work as well as other product,"My pointer is lame due to a fractured growth plate that wasn't repaired when she was a pup. Because Best Friends discontinued Advanced Joint Support, I have been trying other products. A single Vet's Best pill in the morning isn't working for my 46 lb pointer. She hasn't limped in the two years I've had her... until I ran out of Best Friends' product and started her on this. I will try a higher dose."
4,Works ok,it does ease some of my dog's pain but he's still hurting. i'd recommend it for small aches & pains but that's it
5,Helped my baby Choco!,"This is good stuff! It is best when ONLY used in the most necessary of circumstances, because it does make your dog drowsy and also can cause some upset stomach.I've only used this once so far on my Pekingese and I followed the directions and it did help him when he was in pain due to a cut on his tongue.Be very sure to follow the directions!I'm glad I made this purchase!"
1,Not exactly aspirin-free,"Salacin was the original precursor to aspirin, aspirin itself was developed to avoid the stomach irritation effects of Salacin. Including stomach bleeding. The dose here is probably too low to hurt, but people should know that willow bark preparations are not safer than aspirin."
5,Absolutely the best salsa CD in existence!,Brightens your day when you play this CD. Bring to any salsa party and they'll be dancing away all night. Ruiz has the voice of an angel and he smiles throughout the CD. I love his pronunciation of the spanish words. Just a pleasure to have these songs be mine.
3,"Good Overall, but images are disappointing","Nice book, but the ""striking images"" claimed by the editorial review is a bit far fetched."
5,up to par,"this is the newest installment to the litmus collection and a great one at that this album is a lil different from previous releases but in a good way this album has the likeing of current social issues like star69, the president, viversection in space, and just good original style that only litmus can posess i give this album 2 thumbs up"
2,Not so great,"Looked great, until the collar of our dog got caught in the design on front. Got rid of the thing quickly."
5,Worked great for motocycle pipe/fairing application,"I bought this product because I had an issue on my race motorcycle where my aftermarket Yosh pipe was pushing against the bottom of my fiberglass fairing.I discovered the problem when on my first practice day where the fairing was burnt significantly. Another couple days and the hot pipe would have burnt a hole in the fiberglass.I searched and found this stuff, and stuck it to the bottom of the fairing so the pipe contacted it. I chose this material because it says it can withstand direct heat up to 1750 degrees.It saved my fairings and I get no burn marks at all. In my specific application the shield does need to be replaced about every 4 races as it breaks down, but I think this is reasonable as the pipe is pushing pretty hard on the shield.Very impressed with this, would buy again and would highly recommend."
3,Don't believe the ads for this item,"The description of this product claims it will wake you up with a buzzer, radio, CD, or ""the sounds of birdsong or a rushing river"". It also claims to have 5 station presets, which implied to me that it must have a digital tuner. Neither claim is true. The fancy wakeup sounds don't exist and the tuner is the inferior analog style with a big dial and pointer that really can't pull in a clean FM station. Needless to say, there are no preset buttons.On a positive note, it's a pretty good sounding small CD player and the clock has nice big numbers. But I was hoping to have a nice radio also -("
3,Sony IFC-CD837 AM/FM Stero Clock Radio with CD Player,"The CD Player doesn't work right. You insert a CD and it will start to play whatever song on the tape it feels like it, maybe #8. I shipped the product back to the seller and noticed him that I shipped it back on 09/10/2010. It took me awhile to find his email. I paid a $156.98+tax and I have nothing. I've sent him an email to ask what he is going to do, but haven't received a word.Purchased from Talus"
1,Tube Failure - Customer Support,"I bought my set 4 years ago and just like Jeff in the first review, the service man says that the tube is defective and that I need a new tube and it would be cheaper to buy another set.I also spent the extra on a Sony thinking the quality was at least as good as my 16 year old RCA which is still working. My problem is also an apparant short in the tube which has now completely quit. I have tried in vain to find Sony Customer Service to discuss the issue but apparently at Sony there is no Customer Service."
3,No longer the best,"Purchased this 4 years ago and the tube is defective. I spent the extra on a Sony thinking the quality was at least the same as my 20 year old Sony(which is still working). After talking to 3 repairmen, Sony is not what it used to be. My problem (intermitent short in tube) is known by Sony (so says one repairmen) but is not important enough to be addressed by Sony. The cost of the tube makes buying another brand my best option. Before buying, just try to call Sony Service."
5,seventh heaven,My video got here fast and it was all correct. I sat and watched it for 2 days and it was great!
2,Losing grace.,"7th Heaven - The Complete Eighth Season is really corny and boring. Even more unwanted characters are brought in, a new female cop who works with Lucy's man Kevin, and a new preacher dude, and many many more people pop in every few episodes. The cast has always been weak but now it's evident. This was the last season I watched, watch season 8 and you'll know what I mean."
3,Where's the closed captioning?,"My family very much enjoys this series, but closed captioning is important to us, and even though the description and packaging claim there is closed captioning we cannot access it on season 8 DVDs. We own seasons 1 through 5 and have no trouble using the closed captioning with those, so I do not believe it is a case of ineptitude on our part. Does anyone else have this problem with season 8?"
2,It'll do...I guess.,"The keyboard range is far too small, several of the keys don't work properly and it took well over a month for my MIDI cable to arrive from the seller. All-in-all, it is a necessary part of my studies but I'm not very happy with this keyboard."
4,No problems with Windows 7 SP2 / Mixcraft 5,"I bought this keyboard in order to be able to create drum/bass/keys sequences to help when I'm composing music.PROS:- Works with Windows 7 SP2, just download/install drivers prior to plugging it in the first time.- Worked with Mixcraft 5 with zero configuration.- No latency issues as far as I can tell- Pitch/Modulation wheels have a nice feel- InexpensiveCONS:- Installing/certifying the KeyRig software synth was a bit of a hassle. The method by which they certify the software via the internet is broken, so you'll need to download an update from the m-audio website.- Velocity detection on the keys is a bit touchyOverall, I'd recommend it if your needs are similar to mine."
5,Perfect for me,"All you have to do is plug it in to your computer's USB port, turn it on, and run SimplePiano, or any other similar free Windows program that takes input from a MIDI device and outputs it to the MIDI sound output that comes with Windows, and start playing. It's perfect on my lap, with my laptop computer on the table. You can play 4 octaves on it without having to use the octave-shift buttons. This has been perfectly adequate for me to learn piano and just fool around with melodies and chords."
2,Cheap-O Midi Controller,"You get what you pay for. The M-Audio Keyrig feels as cheap as a Casio keyboard. The pitch bend and mod wheel are kind of nice,sturdy rubber, but the keys are light and feel like they could break under your fingers if you really whaled on them. There are no other controls on it other than a volume control. If you want a control surface with some knobs and sliders you may want to look at this model's big brother. I used to have an old version of the Oxygen 8. That controller was pretty solid, yet still inexpensive. You get what you pay for."
1,Great until it just stops working,"This is a nice inexpensive controller until it just stops working. The symptoms are; it still lights up, the pitch bend, modulation and volume slid still sends midi signals, but the keyboards goes dead.There may be parts available to repair it from M-Audio, but the cost is 25-45% of the price.Sorry M-Audio, I cannot recommend this unit."
1,NO SOFTWARE OR USB AUDIO INTERFACE!!!,"I was really disappointed that this M-Audio Keyboard didn't come with the usual M-Powered Pro Tools Essentials or the USB Audio Interface. I Googled the exact same keyboard ""pro tools keystudio"" and found it for $79.99 at B&H...WITH THE PRO TOOLS RECORDING SOFTWARE AND USB AUDIO INTERFACE! STOP SELLING STRIPPED DOWN VERSIONS OF THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Great product,This product did everything i expected. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a midi keyboard. I love it.
5,so easy to use with GarageBand!,"just got this midi keyboard yesterday to use with GarageBand and it is literally ""plug and play."" love it. it's not meant to do anymore than that. there are no built-in midis or instruments or anything like that. but that's not the point. it does exactly what it's meant to do so far, and i only hope that it holds up over time. i wouldn't say it's a solidly constructed machine, but it's not cheap either. i'm excited to do some easy composing on this thing. definitely better than using the ""keyboard typing"" option on GarageBand that i'd been using. and it's got octave, pitch bend, and modulation keys. not bad. for the price? a great buy."
3,"I have Vista 32 bit, and it worked fine.","So I'm only using this midi keyboard for Finale. Aside from that it's not worth the money for an actual ""performance"" keyboard, the reaction is somewhat slow. Again, I'm running on Vista, I'm sure that if you have a better computer with a faster processor it'll run smoother. Either way, despite all the conflicts previous vista users have had with this product, I found no problem."
2,Are you kidding?,"I am a fan of just about every style of turntable music, but this record is really bad. It's not wierd enough to be avant-garde, it's not slick enough to be jazz and it's not beat enough to be funky. Buy Pimp Daddy Nash or St Germain or CPEN and you'll be a lot happier than if you bought this mess. And if you want just ambient strange sounds -try DJ Spooky."
3,DJ Logic's colorful spin on jazz,"I saw DJ Logic open for the Dave Matthews Band, and I immediately knew that this is an artist worth checking into. Along with the music, seeing people dancing in their seats was what sold me. 'The Anomaly' basically captures the improvisational spirit of jazz, the groovy rhythms of funk, all under the framework of instrumental hip-hop. Just think St Germain meets RJD2 meets Cut Chemist. Blended into the mix is everything from Miles Davis trumpet bursts, Sly Stone basslines, to DJ turntable scratching. DJ Logic achieves the ultimate celebratory experience...turntabilism you can dance to."
1,Get other stuff,"You'd be better off getting ""Bull of the Woods"" and/or ""Easter Everywhere."" Both of these albums are pure gems without one clunker. Classis psychedelia. These albums were obviously made for enjoying a psychedelic experience, and you're in good hands. Very positive music that unfolds in you rather than preaches to you."
4,Absolutely Astounding.,"As I browsed CD selections (in another, ""unmentionable"" bookstore) I came across Binocular's and gave it a listen to. I was amazed. The songs were simple yet not syrupy, infectious yet not annoying. I couldn't help but thinking that this guy is what Duncan Sheik was SUPPOSED to sound like (before he sunk into his depressive mode). Not only are the songs upbeat and positive, but they're actually inspiring! So why only 4 stars? Only because it hasn't stood the test of time (I bought just it yesterday after listening to the first 4 songs). If it's still in my rotation a year from now (and I suspect it will be), THEN it gets the full five. Honestly, you can't miss with this CD. Get it and hold onto it - everyone else will have sticky fingers as soon as they hear it!"
5,Healing and Hooking,"Full of heartache and hope, this cd will lift the most leaden spirit. Highly polished but original, every song on here is pleasing. I am in Fort Myers, Florida and am going to get every club and radio station in town to play it. People need to hear this. A nice break in the wall of gloom that predominates much of the pop industry. Everyone I play this to likes it. You must join us."
4,Destined to be a classic,"Never heard of Binocular before today - Caught a live performance at an HMV Record store in NYC and was blown away. Got a signed copy of the CD and just finished listening - GREAT STUFF! I think if any of the radio stations catch on to it, it's going to be BIG. I'm rating it 4 stars - reserving 5 stars for all time classics. As another reviewer stated, if Binocular passes the test of time (which i think is very likely), then it'll get 5."
5,Desert island disc.,"This is also a desert island disc for me. I still enjoy listening to it after owning it for years . .He has a new album ""Landmark"", btw. It's a bit hard to find . . I think he's trying to protect his Kevin Rudolf ""hip hop"" image. I have a complete disconnect when I think of Kevin Rudolf and Binocular. In fact, when I saw him on the Super Bowl preshow, I had no idea it was him. When I came to the realization, it was a complete shock . . that he had made it out of obscurity as a ""hip hop"" artist.Anyway, the new Binocular album is good, though not as immediate as his self-titled release. In fact, I didn't like Landmark at all until many repeated listens. But it's definitely worth getting if you're a Binocular fan. Let's hope Kevin continues composing Binocular music, as I believe that's where his heart truly lies."
3,roofing nails,I purchased (2) boxes of these nails to use with (2) brand New Stanley Bostich RN45-B1 Coil roofing guns. Used them on a small job (10x16 shed roof) and experienced consistent jams. On a larger job we used both (NEW) guns with one using the sequential tip trigger and the other using the contact tip. We both experienced jams on a regular basis. Fortunately the RN45 is easy to clear a jam but it became quite frustrating on a roof in Texas in 100 degree weather putting up 38 squares of roofing material.
1,This movie is quite bad,"This movie is basically a cheap rip off of the whole X-Men mutants story. Billy Balwin, and two cohorts are mutants sent back in time to help thwart disaster in the future. Of course, since Baldwin is involved, you know the acting is horrible. The dialogue is wretched at times, and the special effects (especially the fire effects) are totally cheesey. Save your money and buy both X-Men movies instead."
1,Drains batteries even when off,"Purchased 100 of these for our school alert system. Even with the radio off, will drain a NiCad inside of a week. Uniden tech support is non-existent. Would have to pay more to send them back then they are worth.Stay away from this radio, and Uniden as well until their support improves."
1,horrible battery life,"Do not buy these, spend extra money for a better pair. The batteries last 1 1/2 hours max!!! By the 4th time I tried different batteries within a 2 week period, I wrote to Uniden demanding my money back. I haven't heard from them yet but trust me, don't buy these. On the one plus side, when they didn't run out of power, the range and sound was good."
3,"Pros: easy to use, size - Cons: batter performance - fixed by Uniden","I had the battery issue with mine, they would last 4mins or less. I contacted Uniden via website(you can call them too) and shipped the radios to them for $4 shipping(open an incident w/them first).They replaced faulty capacitors which would allow the batteries to drain fast on the radios for free. Batteries perform better now, radios are easy to use.Uniden can do better in keeping customer up to date. I had to request status often. Had the radios back in 1.5 week. Uniden shipped the radios back via FedEx and provided me the tracking number.These radios are nice since they have great features: scan, key lock, 22 channels, small size, easy to use push to talk button.Uniden was nice enough to fix them in a relatively small time, for free(except my $4 to ship to them)."
1,terrible battery life,I bought these for christmas for my sons the batteries didn't even last an hour I thought it was just me or something I was doing wrong but after reading the reviews I see it's the productI wish I had read the reviews first. don't buy this product
1,The Battery Chomper,"Played with them for less than half hour or so and the unit drained three AAA Alkaline batteries - amazing. They should be called ""The disappearing battery trick"".You get what you pay for I guess.Dont even waste your time with these."
1,eats batteries,"Uses up batteries like crazy. Doesn't seem to do subchannels either. I need channel 8.2 for my club, but it I can't find a way to access that."
1,"PC2, DDR2....I need answers",I got a PC2 Ram and it definitely cant fit in my notebook. I thought it was a a SDDR2 for my inspiron 1520. I sent it back to BUYNOW and i have yet to recieve a refund. I am no longer in the US and I would really like my money back to buy another Ram.
4,memoty,excelente memoria la recomiendo ampliamente la compre con total seguridad ya que el modelo era el que se le adaptaba a la computadora personal y calzo tal cual esperaba
2,This ram did not work.,This ram did not work. It fit perfictly and I have purchased ram in the past for the same machine but I got nothing. The seller was very kind but the product was not.
5,Good RAM,"I have used Kingston memory products since my first Packard Bell computer with a 486 DX2 processor. I have always been well satisfied, as I am this time. It came rapidly, in the original sealed packaging. I am well satisfied."
5,ok,is a product of good quality I arrive at the indicated time okand u ken buy I recommend it as a trusted site
2,Check if your motherboard take High density before buy it.,"It is very good price buthere is warning for old motherboard user !This is one sided high density memory.It doesn't work for some old motherboard even same MHz and DDR2, PC5300.It shows only half of capacity (514MB) and constantly reboot or your BIOS maybe not recognize it at all.I have same Kingston DDR2, PC5300 which is double sided low density and it's working but not this one.It may or may not work for your motherboard.Check if your motherboard take High density single sided before buy it.if your current DIMM is ""Double sided"", tips are on both side, this may may not work.if your current DIMM is ""Single sided"", tips are on only one-side, this is good deal."
1,Wrong memory because of incorrect description,Ordered this memory and then found it is not the product that is stated in the desctiption. Wasted my money. Should have known better.
2,NOT AS EXPECTED,THIS RAM IS WORKING SLOWER THAN I TAUGHT MY 1 GIG WORKS FASTER THAN IT I DONT KNOW IF IT IS THE COMPUTER OR THE RAM. HOWEVER WHEN I REPLACE THE RAM WITH MY 1 GIG IT WORKED BETTER THAN THE TWO GIG I PURCHASE. SORRY BUT THIS IS THE TRUTH TRY IT FOR YOURSELF
5,Just great,This is a very good product at a very good price.Just what I needed to increase my computer speed.
5,Easy to install,"With this purchase of 2 more modules, I now have a total of 8GB in mydesktop. I would have purchased these from other online stores, wereit not for the fact that they did not have them in stock."
4,Good memory.,I chose this product by brand name and prize.Bought two 1GB DIMM to upgrade my HP Desktop to Max 3GB possible.Have no problems after one and half years.Speed was generally increased.
4,"Worked great and increased speed, however........",This is a good product and preforms well. But it should be noted that it is slightly more than 2GB of RAM. So if you purchase 2 and install them and your system only supports 4GB you may have some problems (like I did). Fortunately I was able to swap one out of another computer so I would have slightly less than 4GB so it all worked out.Otherwise it worked great.
5,Useful memory (pt 2 of 2).,"I upgraded my OS (Win) from x86 to x64, to take advantage of built in speed capabilities of system and software (went from 3gig to 6gig). I do see the change, and am glad of my purchase."
4,works good,"I have a smaller parlor guitar. It is the only I thought would fit. Picture on the site was wrong though, there is no volume control on this pickup. I looked around and got a good view of one before I bought this one, so I wasn't confused. The pickup is good, sounds great, has a little feed back."
2,"Sounds good, but won't last the long-haul...","It sounds good, but no use if it can't stay in the soundhole. I placed my pickup into a portable Yamaha F-1 acoustic.It fit snuggly - fine, great.However, after only about a handful of times taking the pickup out and putting it back into the soundhole, the PLASTIC ""stays""/notched pegs which swivel and brace the soundhole (that is, the plastic pieces which keep the pickup in the soundhole) would not stay taught/fixed.The result - the plastic stays would swivel too easily and collapse the pickup into the soundhole - bummer.I returned it, consequently."
1,Oops for me,"This set is the one I thought I had ordered. However, I got the ones with the smaller rollers. I have tried to make them work for my hair but no go."
1,Very disappionting!!!!!!!!!,"I recently bought this product thinking that it would curl my hair, but the product did nothing for that. My hair is very fine, and very straight so this did not help much. I had a hard time trying to curl my hair. When I thought it was ""done"" my hair was left bent. I would not try this product ever again. But it might curl your hair if it is not fine or straight."
1,Poor Design,This product was advertised with metal clips to hold the curlers in place.Instead it came with butterfly clips which crimp the hair where it holds onto the roller. They are also very heavy when you have a head full of them. The heating process did not work well either. I sent them back as they were entirely unsatisfactory. I could not use them.
4,Misleading Info,"I got this product in a timely manner, the product worked great..BUT...i didnt receive the clips with the rollers. Instead, they sent me 20 pins.. NOT what I wanted or what I ordered. I had to call CONAIR and struggle with them just to send me 10 clips for free.. Dont order this product if you want the clps.."
1,CHEAP rollers. Nice clips.,"This is CHEAP JUNK. The curls go away after about 30 minutes... And I have easily curlable hair. These seem to actaully STRAIGHTen my hair, and leave it FRIZZY. It also BURNS your scalp badly. They do NOT shine your hair AT ALL. They may work if you have extremly thin hair but do not even try if you have normal to thick hair. I tried it, and my family and friends who also tested all agree these are junk. I really like the clips. I spent $30. on clips I guess? The clips are great. I use them with my other curlers. Spend a little bit more and get professtional ionic curlers. I swear you will be happier."
2,"Good Concept, Poor Performance","The rollers only warmed up to ""luke warm"" - even let them heat up for 30 minutes and there was no difference. The ""warm"" clips really aren't warm after sitting on the warming rack, the spring on the clip wasn't that strong so it failed to ""grasp"" the roller tightly which resulted in the clips continually falling off the roller. Good ""concept"", bad execution of design. :("
4,Conair Hot Rollers,"I have been using hot rollers since I was a teen. I have tried many brands, and have been sorely disappointed in all but Conair. In my opinion, they are the best around. The only negative for this set are the clips. I much prefer the previous design. They were light and flexible and held the rollers in place. These clips are too small; do not hold the rollers securely, and they are made of hard plastic which is not the most comfortable material. Fortunately, I kept my old clips and they work fine with this set.The rollers heat up quickly, and as promised give great shine to the hair. I give a thumbs up!Conair would be perfect if they could design a case that doesn't break during travel."
2,the hair clips leave VERY noticeable crimps in hair,Very disappointed with the hair clips that come with these rollers. They leave a very obvious line/crimp in the hair.
4,using hot rollers for years and years,"Like another reviewer, I have had a set of Conair hot rollers that lasted me for 10+ years. So easy to use and gave me beautiful hair. However, the flocking had worn off, so I was always burning my fingers, plus I had lost most of the pins. I found this set as a replacement, expecting to receive generally the same set. I wanted multiple roller sizes, but it seems like the diameter of these rollers are smaller than my old set. Guess I needed a jumbo size to compare to what I had before. I have long, thick heavy hair (length is at my bra line), so I have to use all of them at once to hold all my hair. The rollers themselves are wonderful. Great curl! But the clips are horrible!! They leave bad dents in my hair and just barely hold the rollers in if I'm lucky. I'll be looking for some metal pins to hold these in, but otherwise great set giving me lots and lots of curls that lasted two days."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Pros:Very Hot Curlers. I love that they hold their heat well and heat up pretty quickly. I do get nice curls.Cons:I agree with other reviewers that the clips that come with the set are terrible. I'm glad I kept the ones from my old set.I hate that sometimes they slip into the split though. I really hate that part more than anything. If they were solid rollers I'd give this 4 stars.There are only 6 medium rollers and there are 6 tiny ones. Who uses 6 tiny rollers? Wish it had more mediums.I think I'll go back to the wax curlers though, or at least something without the split in the middle and shell out the money for a 30 piece set."
4,Works in 20 mins or less!,"I am a mom of 2 and this is perfect when I have a busy day. Rollers heat up in about a minute. It takes me about 10 mins to insert all of the rollers and another 10-15 to set. I usually leave them in longer because I love tight curls. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick hair fix. Plus, they come with clips so you don't have to purchase them."
1,wire clips do not work,rollers heat up but wire clips do not hold ....rollers stay loose and fall off. Very bad design. conair needs to design a clip that works on large rollers.
5,Worth it,I purchased these for a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law who has long thin hair - this has transformed her hair into a full head of beautiful dazzling curls and she LOVES them. She had never used hot rollers ever and now is HOOKED on them! I am So glad she's enjoying them - I've had hot rollers myself for 25 years and they are a MUST when it comes to style and manageability.
1,Horrible!!,"The clips are so cheap!! They aren't nearly strong enough to hold your hair in place. I wish I could speak to how well the rollers work, but I couldn't get them to stay in long enough to find out. If you are lucky enough to get the clips to work, be prepared to sit very still until the rollers are cool!"
4,Pretty good,"I do like them because the curl looks good, lasts a couple of days and they heat up fast. If they sit more than 10 mins they get pretty hot and burn my fingers, even the clips can get that hot. Still, its not enough to bother me too much. The clips do leave marks in my hair but fade fast enough to not bother me."
1,Melted,These rollers melted - so bizarre - clearly defective. So disappointed because my prior conair rollers lasted for 10 years!
2,Don't purchase,"Clips are cheap and don't hold the curlers in your hair, worst money that I've ever spent. If anyone has any ideas on a quality set of hot curlers please share?"
1,Warning - Overheated and melted,"My wife purchased this unit less than a year and it did curl hair. However, my wife plugged it in and it immediately began to smoke. Within seconds the curler ends and clips melted onto the heating elements! Very dangerous! Needless to say, I would not recommend this product."
4,"Ok, but prefer jumbo rollers","I really like Conair rollers. These heat up quickly and are great to use, but with my short hair, I just prefer to use the jumbo rollers. I tried these thinking they might work better. They leave a much tigher curl than I want."
2,"Makes a Decent Curl, But Not Worth Buying","I have naturally curly hair, but I've always had a problem with frizz and my curls having a uniformed look.While these do give a nice curl towards the bottom, the top looks all wrong. The clips do NOT hold very tight. Many rollers fall out during use and don't keep the roller at your scalp. The clips also cause dents near the top of your curls. I had to resort to curling the top layer of my hair with a large barrel iron.If you can salvage the outer layers of your hair, the curls created by these hot rollers will last all day and look very nice. However, if you don't have a lot of time to spend on your hair, I wouldn't recommend these."
3,OK for the cost,"It heats up quickly and curls my hair, but the curlers are slippery and make it difficult for me to wrap my hair around them, giving my strange kinks at the end of the strands. I'm hoping that more practice will solve this problem."
1,Absolutely the worst!!!,"I bought this product because I needed to replace the molecular curler set that finally wore out after about 12 years of tried and true service. I could not find another set of these in the store so I ""settled"" on this product. Let me tell you, I shouldn't have... The curl does not stay in my hair for more than about 45 mins (if that) sometimes it does not even LOOK like I curled it. My hair is VERY easy to curl and will HOLD curl all day when the right product is used. The clips did not even work properly, I was always having to fix the rollers from coming out. I finally got wise, got on line, found another set of Caruso Molecular Rollers and ordered them. I will try to find someone who really does not want to have curly hair and give them this set....NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
2,Not that great...........,"First - no blue clips came with it, as advertised. Second - doesn't curl very well. Edges of rollers pretty hot to handle, too."
1,Clips do not work ~ puts large crimp in hair near scalp ~ poor design,"Poor Design. The plastic clips do not work as intended. They put a large crimp in my hair near my scalp. I like nice soft ""even"" curls. I have long hair, but it would likely do the same for short hair. I cannot recommend."
1,yuck,"First of all, my rollers came with the fishy shaped looking clips. I hate them. They do not hold my thick, wavy hair and they also leave a weird indentation that gets ""burned"" into the hair. So, in the middle of the curl, there is an occasional flat ""whip"" mark. Additionally, my hair gets caught on the hinge part of the clip. The lid cracked and broke off two weeks after I bought it.I really don't like these. I miss my old rollers, which had the velvety cover on the roller and a softer heat that seemed to do less damage to my long hair. Usually I use my rollers until they wear out, but I am going to donate these to the Salvation Army along with a NEW box of clips!"
1,Not Worth It!!!,I'm returning this product. I found various opinons in the reviews on the Conair hair clips but I now agree with all those that weren't impressed with them. This comes with wire clips that just don't work. It's very frugal of Conair to sell this hair setter with cheap clips. To me that's like selling a vase that doesn't hold water very well. Unless you already own some good clips and you don't need the rollers very hot...I'd keep on looking.
2,Unbelievably flimsy!,"Is plastic getting expensive? Because the plastic that the hinged cover on this is made out of is SO THIN...I would describe it as ""fragile."" In fact, there's already a small crack on one side.The on/off switch was also faulty - I had to jiggle it back and forth to get it to turn on initially. It would only stay on if I kept the switch positioned in the middle.This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly, and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better ""house.""Thank goodness the switch was faulty and part of it arrived cracked, since you can return defective items and not pay for the return shipping on Amazon!"
2,Worked great until they melted!,"Easy to use, made my hair look awesome, big improvement over curling iron. Problem is, 3rd time I used these hot rollers the plastic part of the rollers melted, shorted out the product for good. This was on the medium heat setting. I got it as a gift so don't have a receipt for warranty. Lame!"
4,Conair - shipped with wrong clips,"This Conair Heat Hair Setter works fine. However, one of the reasons I ordered this was because of the new types of clips that was advertised in the product description. They were not, however, included. I received the hair setter with the old style of clip which does not work well with my fine hair."
1,The picture is wrong,It would be nice if the product delivered actually came with the accessories in the pictures. I purchased this specifically for the wide clips for my wife's hair. After seeing my wife use it I find that it has those cruddy little metal clips that slide right out of her hair. Mybe Amazon should do a little fact checking and inspect the products they sell before they blindly put pictures on their web site.
5,Great set,"I love this hair curler set. I have purchased two of them now, one for each daughter. Both have long, thick hair and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it. It takes just a few minutes to heat up and the soft velvet lining on the rods make it less damaging to hair.The only thing I always hate is the clips! Even though there is a small case to hold them, sometimes they get lost! Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated. I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large ones!!Recommended."
4,"not too shabby... the clips are terrible, though","first of all, do NOT buy this from amazon. they will overcharge you and i purchased mine for like 20 bucks at drugstore.com. that being said, these curlers are awesome. i've been very impressed with my hair (which is pretty dry and unhealthy so it curls easily). My hair holds the curls and looks shiny - also, it only takes about 15 min to set.My hair looks flippy and cute right now because i curled it the night before! yay.my only complaint is that the pins to hold the curlers SUCK. ugh. what a pain in the butt. i have to hold my head annoyingly still so the curlers dont slip out. those stupid pins dont work well at all. i usually put the curlers in and then put on a cap so i can go around without them falling out.i bought other conair clips that are supposed to keep the curlers in place but they sucked as well. i will be giving them a neg review for sure. still, the curlers themselves are great!"
2,OW!!,"THIS SET CURLED WELL IF YOU COULD OPEN THE LID, BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF HARD. I BURNED MY FINGERS ON THE ROLLERS, AND I HATE THE CLIPS. THEY DIG MY SCALP. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT AS WELL AS OTHER SETS I'VE HAD."
4,Much Better Than a Culing Iron,"My title says it all.You can set your hair really fast! I love it for that. Want curly hair for work today? You don't have to get up 3 hours before to get ready. I can set my hair in 5 minutes, then wait 5 minutes (brush teeth, make-up etc) then take them off.I have impossible-to-curl hair (have done 3 in home perms with my hair looking exactly the same as to when I started them).The curls hold for most of the day which is more that I can say for the curling iron (I get tired of holding it so I don't get good curls).So this is like many mini curling irons in your hair at the same time.The only bad thing is that my set of rollers came with some weird pins to hold them in place that I can't figure out how to work for the life of me. So I ended up buying just a set of metallic cheap clampy pins to hold them in place."
2,"Eh, ok","This product claims to heat up in 2 minutes, but you need to leave it heating for 10 if you want the curls to stay. Even then, the curls only stay for a few hours. I'm debating spending a little more money for something with longer lasting results. I have long straight hair."
3,Love and hate,"This curler set is awesome becuase it heats up so fast, the curls are great and last all day....but, because of the clamps (that I was really excited about) it leaves a crease in your hair at the top of your curl. So now I have to get out my curling iron or straightener to get that crease out. If I roll the curls high enough on top of my head I don't get the crease, but I will be looking for a different set of curlers because of the crease problem. I guess the old metal hooks are better."
2,Horrible,"The clips are horrible. The old school wire ones works much better and don't leave huge dents in my hair. The curlers work well and heat up quickly. I just wish I had kept the old wire pins from a previous set. I'll be ordering something else. Not to mention, there are too many small size curlers."
3,TOO LONG TO HEAT CLIPS,"Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right. So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn't the one with the dot, there's no way to tell if it's heated or not. Then you have to wait for one of the three clips to heat as well. It is weird! It seemed to take a long time to heat up, though I didn't time it.This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn't rave about it. If not for the hassle, I'd return it.I just ordered another set that looks like the one I used to have with the U-shaped clips (BaByliss Pro) and hopefully it will be what I'm thinking it is."
4,Item received is not what is listed,I received my order today. There is no on/off switch. The rollers themselves seem to work well however the clips are worthless. They do not hold the curlers in place very well at all. I am sending this back and getting something else.
3,Not thrilled,"The roller set is quick to heat and there are enough rollers for my hair (just past shoulder length, pretty fine, lots of layers). I'm hardly a professional, and was hoping hot rollers would be simple enough that I could set, cool, and go. While my hair was more voluminous than usual, the staying power (with a setting spray) wasn't incredible. I'd definitely believe that this is due to my hair, rather than the product -- even professional stylists can't get my hair to hold a curl.I would like to note that the product description is inaccurate -- rather than coming with ""20 wire hair clips,"" as advertised, the set came with large plastic clips which leave noticeable crimps in my hair.Oh well... maybe Dolly Parton hair just isn't attainable for me :("
4,Worked well on my hard to manage hair,"I was born, or blessed (depending on the occaision), with stick-straight, baby-fine hair. This product allowed me to put gentle curls in that stayed. (I usually don't even have that much luck with a curling iron.) Also, my hair had so much more volume when I pulled the rollers out--a big advantage.My biggest issue was the clips. Because my hair is so fine, the clips wanted to fall out. I finally found a way that worked for me, and all it took was practice!I loved the fact that I was able to use these rollers. In addition to my super fine hair, I have lots of layers, which usually don't work with rollers. Because of the smooth texture, I was able to wrap as much or as little hair around the rollers to work with my style.Now I am ready to reveal my curls to everyone else!"
1,Terrible,"Do not buy this machine. Doesn't heat hot enough to curl anything, hair falls limp rapidly. This set is terrible, dont waste your money, I just returned mine to Walmart where it belongs."
1,I NEED SOMEONE TO REPLY ASAP,"There are parts missing and the unit does not work! IT won't heat up at all. Seriously, I want my money back ASAP! T"
2,Dumb Design,"Who would design a hair setter with no place to hold the pins? They come in a separate pouch, which means it would be too easy to pack the hair setter and forget the pins. The top is flimsy, and although the cord can be wrapped around the bottom, there is no clip to hold it. How much would it have cost to add on a tiny plastic clip or two? The metal pins are difficult to place, although they do hold well. The curls made with the setter are pretty good, but it seems to me that this little appliance was designed by someone who had never used one and had never consulted anyone who did."
1,Bad Choice,"I've been curling my hair for over ten years and have tried several curling irons and curler sets inorder to find the perfect match. These curlers were definitely not the perfect match. The clips don't work very well if at all, letting the rollers fall out of your hair. The curlers themselves get stuck in my hair, and the curls only last about an hour. This was the worst curler set I've ever tried."
1,Beware,"These hot rollers are completely useless! I have loooong thick straight healthy hair, and these rollers do not grip or curl well. The clips included are terrible, no grip at all. I hated using these rollers. I have a lot of hair, so I had curl about 1/2 my hair, reheat the rollers and then curl the rest. And the curls didn't even come out well! I bought this to save time, not waste it. Should of stuck with the curling iron. Amazon return policy was so horrible, I decided not to return. Will be regifting. Amazon is good for buying books and not much else."
1,"Bait and Switch, I did not get what I ordered.","I ordered the Conair Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter which was the same hair setter I had purchased a few years ago, because I was very satisfied with it. I was sent a different model which I found unsatisfactory in several different ways. I was very disappointed with your service, I ordered it online, paid shipping and waited a week, only to receive a different model that I could have purchased at the local Target, not paid shipping, and not waited a week. I won't be a return customer."
2,Clips don't hold the rollers,"The clips that come with this don't hold my hair up, in fact for most of the size rollers the clips are too small to even clip over the roller. I'm not that impressed with the hot rollers either. I will try to by separate clips from the store and maybe that will help but have seen better hot roller machines and this one is not that great."
3,Not good for fine hair,"I have always had issues with curls falling out of my hair, so I shouldn't have expected so much from this. It did work better than the set of conair jumbo rollers, but the curl still fell out. I gave it 3 stars because I love that it comes with clips and not the metal pins. It heats up the clips, so you get heat from the inside and out. It did give my hair some body when the curl fell out, and I will take that! The edges of the curler are rough and tend to get caught in my hair. The only way to avoid this is to use insanely small amounts of hair, which would take more rollers than this has."
2,Clips are the problem!,"I'm trying to grow my hair out, and am at the awkward stage with my bangs. Curling irons were just taking too long, so for the first time in years I decided to try hot rollers again. I read a lot of reviews and decided on this set. I like everything about it, and know that it would do a good job IF the rollers would stay in! The clips are horrible. They don't grab very tightly at all, and for an area like around the face it is impossible to get them to stay. The ones that do stay in leave a really weird little crease from where they clip, causing 'cowlick' type problems. I've almost been in tears from the result a few nights when I had no option but to go the way I looked or start all over and be late. I just bought another set with the old fashioned skinny wire hooks, as most seem to use the clips nowadays and I don't see how any clips would not leave creases. These are going in my next garage sale."
1,Not happy with results,"Though they do heat up quickly, I don't care for the clips. The clips don't seem to grasp my the curlers well and they leave a crease in my hair (shoulder length and fine - but I have tons of it). The 'velvet' finish contributes to the curlers sliding right out. Also the edges of the curlers are too hot for my scalp."
1,No No No,I have used many brands for decades - these rollers have a few issues & I cannot not recommend them - I returned them.1. Putting them back in order is awkward as they have to be fit onto a holder2. The clips simply don't hold --- the pin type are much more secure3. Totally silly to heat the clips --- holds only three at a time and each time you take one off - you put another on - waste of time4. NO STORAGE for the clips -
2,Big Disappointment,"These may work well for someone with fine, easy to curl hair-but not for me.My very hair is fine, but very thick & straight-so the curl lasts about 2 hours at best, and that's with spray or other holding product.The rollers never seem to get really hot, and the clips only fit properly on the large size rollers. The smaller rollers just fall out or you get ""dents""-ugly!The flocking covering probably protects your hair, but it makes using product close to the roots very difficult-you worry about gumming it up.I've had many styling tools from Conair that I loved-but this is not one."
2,Won't hold up,I bought this product and have used it for less than 6 months. One of the heating rails has stopped working and the unit melted one of the rollers so it won't go back on the roller. The design of the rollers - with a gap all the way through - means you are grabbing close to metal and the heat can be high to the tough.
3,Conair Model CHV26HX hot rollers,"The hot rollers do the job, except I use the clips from my old Remington set. The clips that came with the set are not useful.I bought this set because I travel a lot and the curlers stay in place during movement. The actual rollers are not holding up to wear. The heat is too much for the plastic on the bottom of the rollers. The plastic becomes brittle and the bases break off. Each side has three skinny prongs underneath and they just snap off. I emailed the company and got no response about replacement rollers.I have had this set for about 9 months. I do not expect it to last two years.My old set, the Clairol Deluxe hairsetter, lasted 20 years!!! My recommendation: Go to Ebay and get a set of those!"
2,Crimp marks!!,"Yes, these rollers will curl your hair. But the clips leave significant crimp marks, and there doesn't seem to be any way around it. The lovely curls are definitely marred by the marks. Too bad!"
2,Clips are terrible,"I really like this product, I like the rollers and the fact that it heats up very quickly; however, the clips to keep the rollers in are terrible. They barely fit around the rollers, and I find I have to restrict my activities (normal house chores) when wearing them for fear they'll fall out. So if there were better clips I would give a full rating, but I'm really disappointed with the design."
1,Not hot enough and won't stay in tight.,"These were useless. Too heavy to stay in tight with these barely gripping clips. Not hot enough to get my thick hair to curl. Don't buy these if you have thick heavy hair, worthless....."
5,Looking for Jumbo Rollers? You're on the right page,"I absolutely love this product! I already had a set of electric Rollers, but needed something with larger rollers. These rollers heat up in a flash, and in no time, you've got bouncy curls. I had the hardest time finding Jumbo curlers, and am glad Conair thought to make a hair setter with mostly large rollers. Try it, and I'll bet you'll like it. While I have very fine, easy to curl hair, it also worked well on my neice who has very thick-corse hair."
5,"Soft, smooth, bouncy curls!","I think these hair rollers are great. I have long relaxed hair thats extremely difficult to curl without using lots of hairspray. I gave the rollers 15 minutes to heat up and after rolling I left them in for 20 mins while I did other stuff. My curls where so soft and full of body and I did not need to use any hairspray for the set. Only a little afterward for finishing. The plastic lid is fragile and should be handled with care as not to break it. Another trick for difficult to curl hair, like mine, is to wash it the night before.Over all Im very pleased with this product's performance."
1,never ever worked,"I purchased this some time ago, but when new, for some reason I never used it.Pulled it out of the cabinet to try it again, and only ONE curler heated up.So whatever I paid for it, it didn't work."
1,Dissatisfied,"The good thing about these hot rollers is that they heat up fast and curl one's hair well. The bad news is that the large clamp-type clips do not hold the rollers in place. I have thick hair and even then then the provided clips don't hold. When placing a smaller amount of hair on each roller, the rollers still don't hold in place. I have to use my old wire clips to to secure rollers. I would definitely not recommend this product due to the instability of the rollers. Forget about walking around. The rollers fall out."
1,Nice but warranty from Conair stinks,"I used it about ten times in 7 weeks and now the cheap plastic switch doesn't work anymore. Needless to say I cannot use it, cannot turn it on or off. I never left it plugged in when not in use. It didn't get wet. And their warranty is only good for 30 days. In this day and age / throw away society I guess they don't expect it to last any longer than 30 days before you have problems. Prior to this I owned a Clariol hot roller set for 20 years before it died. I am so disappointed that now I have to add it to a land fill because though it looks brand new it sure doesn't work. The set was wonderful but now that it's broken with no hope of replacement it's BOO to Conair."
1,Burnt,"This is probably one of the worst products I've ever purchased. Aside from the fact that it burns your fingers (there's no way to protect yourself other than to wear silicone mitts), the curlers absolutely would not stay in my hair. It's not as though I'm a first time hot curler user. I've been using them for many years. My first try took 15 minutes to get three rollers in and then I gave up. I went back a second time thinking it would be a matter of getting used to a new product. But I just can't get used to a new ""badly designed, never should have been manufactured product"". I can't believe this product even got as far as the store shelf. I returned it after my second try which took an hour, I couldn't move my head or the rollers slid out and the end result was indeed lousy and I did have the creases that they said would not happen. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Shame on you Conair!"
2,BE CAREFUL WITH THIS THEY WILL BURN YOU BAD !!!,I HAVE HAD THESE ROLLERS FOR SOME TIME NOW AND YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF ON THE METAL CLIPS AND AS FAR AS THE LID IT IS VERY INFERIOR AS WELL....ALTHOUGH CONAIR MAKES A GOOD HOT ROLLER THE ENGINEERS FELL SHORT ON THE METAL CLIPS AND LID... THE CLIPS CONDUCT HEAT AND BURN YOUR HEAD AND EARS AND THE LID CRACKS BUT AS FAR AS HOW THEY CURL YOUR HAIR THEY ARE THE BEST. I AM SURE THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE SOME LAWSUITS OVER THIS.
2,Not worth it,"Was so excited to use this product because I usually straighten my hair and wanted to switch it up. I have long, thick hair and this didn't work well at all. The clips are useless, they don't hold my hair. Also, I don't recommend this product if you have a lot of hair because there's not enough hot rollers and you'll have to do 2 rounds. I tried different clips and they held, but when I unrolled the clip the curl that it created was very tight and suzy q like. These rollers are useless, don't waste your money."
2,product disappointment,I don't believe these are worth the money. They don't get or stay hot enough to cure. The seller was fine though so no complaints there.
1,This is garbage,"This is garbage! The rolls won't hold up (they just slid down!!), minimum curling results,only a little curl at the ends an I don't have think hair. Not happy with this product."
3,Stick to the curling iron,"I have really thick hair and was hoping this would work instead of curling it and it doesn't, the rollers to stay in tight. It works but not for the look I was going for, I'll probably return it."
5,LOVE THIS ITEM!!,"I have no complaints about these hot rollers, I love them. This is the third set I bought. I bought one for myself and my sister and best friend kept borrowing it so I bought them each one for Birthdays and Christmas. I will never use a curling iron again! These heat up in 30 seconds and have enough heat to curl my hair in 30mins with really tight curls which my hair is down almost to my butt so it takes forever to curl with a curling iron. I would rate this item 400 stars if I could I love it!"
5,Wife approves.,I bought these for my wife. She seems to be very satisfied with the product. It makes her happy.This is exactly what I wanted.
3,works OK but leaves crimps in hair,"I'm not impressed at all with the cheap plastic clips that are suppose to hold the curlers in place, they flip all over the place and leave creases in what should be a smooth curl. AND they only have a area to *warm* 3 of these. I guess your suppose to use one then replace it and use another.....well, its a pain and not a pretty hairstyle after."
2,Smooth and Straight to ... Frizzy Kinks?,"I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them, but they seem to have become useless somehow. I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don't hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky. I was shocked because they used to work so well. I've taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can't imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week. I will not be buying another set, I think I'm going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.P.S. They only come with three clips."
2,Disappointed,I have had several sets of Conair rollers over the years. The plastic clips that come with this product however are awful. They don't seem to grip and clasp the roller tightly so the rollers end up flopping around your head and then fall out. I was very disappointed with this product and will go back to using my 10 year old set of rollers.
2,don't bother,get the Caruso steam rollers. I have tried 3 of these conair setters and the Caruso stayed in my thick hair and it was easy. The curls last. They are cheaper and come w a lot of diff. size rollers.
1,NOT for thick hair,"If you have thicker hair, the rollers WILL NOT STAY IN. Furthermore, the clips will shoot across the room like bullets and become almost impossible to find, while the lovely pink rollers clatter to the floor and manage to roll under any available surface (perhaps they're magnetic). So you're bending over to find them, and even more of them spring out of your head causing your long (but still straight) hair to cascade down into your eyes, making the search for the pesky little devils that much harder still. I'm absolutely sure that one of those little clippy deals is still stuck in a potted plant or embedded in plaster somewhere. Maybe two of them. Hard to say. Needless to say, I was late for church.I sure wish that the manufacturer had put a disclaimer on the box."
1,Wasn't what i expected,I found these difficult to use unless your into burning your hands. After one use they now reside on my closet shelf until I make my next trip to the GoodWill.
1,terrible waste of money,I have used electric curlers for 25 years and this is the worst product I have ever purchased. Extreme heat in 75 seconds? Lie! How about mediocre heat in 10 minutes! Don't waste your money. Also the clips are terrible and DO NOT secure the curler. Just bad all around.
2,"Not good for thick, longer hair because of clips","If you have medium long to long hair that is thick, this set of hot rollers might drive you insane. The concept is great, but the clips are completely inadequate. They burn your fingers as you try to secure them and just do not seem big or round enough to cover the entire roller around your hair. Several just slipped right out as I tried to secure them, even with small amounts of hair and they hung down instead of more secured to the scalp like they should for optimum curls. I would hesitate to buy them. As far as when you do get one to hold right, the curl comes out nice and if you give yourself some spray, it will turn out ok. Otherwise, I recommend something different."
4,nice rollers,"I like these curlers better than the old style. They do not pull your hair, I was expecting larger rollers, but they do create a nice look, my hair is a little longer than shoulder lenght. I love using them to give me wome height on top, then let the end stay out of the curler so it does not look dated like the old curlers used to make you look with boucy fake looking curls.I am glad I bought them but they do need to warm longer than I expected, especially once you have used them all and need to put a few back in to complete the curling."
4,very very good for the price,"i rally really like this, i just purchased this item at amazon and was glad on delivery too I suggesst thought that you heat it up for a pretty good time at least for 30 minutes before you put them at least i do cause I have thin and fine hair which is hard to keep the curles I have recently had hair extension removed and bleached and colored rught after which it and so much more volume cause of the nice curls especially when you have a choice of different size rollers in one"
2,Not for long hair,I got these and tried them for my hair. I have somewhat thick hair so I got a set with lots of curlers but to my surprise they were tiny rollers. I had to use all the rollers. I tried them on my hair and only the last 3-4 inches was curled. Some curls were so tight and looked a little dumb. Very disappointed... Gunna buy the Babyliss 30 rollers
3,Don't stay in your hair,These curlers do heat quickly...bonus! The problem is that they will not hold a tight curl once put in your hair. I believe the plastic clips that the set comes with just arent tight enough to hold the curler in place.
2,Heats up fast,"I got this set for Christmas. I give it 2 stars because it does heat up fast. What I don't like about it is I really wanted bigger curlers. Not Conair's fault. Also, the clips do not hold your hair very well. Especially if you try to roll on the top of your head. They held ok on the sides if you were still. The teeth are just too short to really dig in and hold well. Another thing I don't like, no on/off switch. Plug it in, it's on. Unplug it to turn it off. I would just prefer an on/off switch. Returning."
3,Not as good as some others,"Even though I am adult, I have read a lot of books by this author. I find that with this author, the fact that it was written for young adults just means she is leaving out stuff I would rather not read about anyway (graphic rape scenes, graphic torture scenes, or whatever). The characters are good, plots are generally good, and pacing good. However, this book is not one of my favorite Sutcliff books. The plot is about the main character taking the place of the heir ""horse lord"" who was blinded by a rival years before. Sort of a ""prince and pauper"" storyline. Didn't like it and didn't find it believable. The heir's family was dead and he hadn't been seen in years, but it really wasn't believable to me that he could fool anyone who had known the heir before. I would recommend Eagle of the Ninth or Frontier Wolves instead."
5,Sutcliff at her finest,"Rosemary Sutcliff is singularly adept at transporting the reader to another place and time, and in ""The Mark of the Horselord"" she excels herself. To call this her finest book when each one is so beautifully crafted is high praise indeed, but I wouldn't hesitate to do so. A vivid setting, a memorable hero and a totally engrossing story combine to make this an excellent read, for, as Sutcliff says, ""children of any age""."
5,Rosemary Sutcliff's best book,"To me, this is the best of Rosemary Sutcliff's many fine books, and my personal favourite. I suppose I should find the basic premise that one man can successfully impersonate another from an entirely different culture with only a brief period of indoctrination, but somehow it hardly seems to matter! You see Phaedrus the gladiator growing into the kingship he has assumed, and finally dying for his people as he has lived for them over his scant year as ruler. As with all Rosemary Sutcliff's books, it works on one level as a really good adventure story, with all the fine detail of battles and riding and chariot driving, but it is far more than that, and every time I re-read it I see something new."
1,Possibly the worst CD player ever?,"Bought this CD player brand new... it refuses to play any CDs, even brand new ones with not even the lightest scratch. It's an over-sensitive piece of junk... an overpriced doorstop. Spend more for a nice Panasonic or Sony, they at least know how to make these things."
3,its alright,when i first got this i wasnt expecting it to be super fabulous or anything. i just needed a CD player for a trip that included a long car ride. over all i think this is a pretty good CD player.i dont like the earbuds but i never liked any of those kind that actually go in your ears because they can hurt sometimes. also in the beginning it would say that it had a low battery after it had been on for a while and i pressed play. but it would blink and go away and it would still work.i think the coolest thing about this is that it has two earphone jacks. really useful. but yeah overall its pretty good.
3,Misses a beat,"I got this CD player from my sister on Christmas. The first thing bad about this product was the packaging. I couldn't open it up. Anyway when I put on a cd the laser scanner that reads the discs took forever to play, and I took it back and wanted my money returned. But I couldn't and got a new one. It's better but the product is still lacks something. I hate the earphones, it always falls out and the wired remote is totally useless. I guess this is CD player is passable because of the music i listen to. METALLICA!"
4,Sinclare family history - our family tree,"This book is exactly what my husband wanted. I was suprised, however, that it was just a black hardcover book - there was nothing on the front indicating author or title.I highly recommend this book."
2,Too expensive,Way to expensive for the features it has. For the same price go with a Sherwood reciever. Everything this guy has plus dobly digital and DTS.
2,Does AIWA stand up to the challenge?,"I have owned an AIWA bookshelf system for 4 years and it has given me my fair share of problems. I am also aware of others having similar technical problems with their AIWA systems. I think it's great that AIWA is joining the AC3(Dolby Digital) train, but I question the performance of its receiver in the long run in comparison to more well-known brands (Denon, Sony). Think twice before you purchase a $300 receiver. In any case, when attaining a home theater system, the receiver is one of the most crucial pieces of the puzzle and it is worth it to spend the extra $$ for a ""quality"" system. . ."
1,A Royal Scam,"These demos were released without Donald Fagen and Walter Becker's approval and against their wishes. ""Old Regime"", ""Sun Mountain"", ""Android Warehouse"", ""Catalyst"", ""The Founders of Steely Dan"", ""Becker and Fagen (or Fagen and Becker) Presents"" and the dozens of other titles this same collection of demos are constantly repackaged under are in their most primitive forms. Do you really think Steely Dan, a band known for their sonic perfection, would want this revealed to the public? If you're a Dan completist and care to hear the earliest demo versions of a few SD classics Barrytown (Pretzel Logic) Caves of Altamira (The Royal Scam), and Brooklyn (Can't Buy A Thrill) try and borrow a copy rather than buy it. I wouldn't give the cretin who released this a penny."
5,game is sweet,i have only rented the game but i can still tell you how good it is... actually the graphics are surprisingly good i was in aw. nut anywaythe game has a ton of good options of games to choose from(1 and 2 players)! so i am a fan of the dukes so maybe thats why i like the game so much but it is worth buying!
1,"just the good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm","This game feels like it was created by eight-year olds who joined the official Dukes Of Hazzard fan club and were selected as winners in a contest. The first game wasn't any good but at least it wasn't terrible. The cars go from understeering to oversteering in a blink of an eye and if cars from Driver can go from one end of a city to another without loading, I think we can go from road to road without loading. Whatever..."
2,South Peak Rushed This Game...,"There is no dought in my mind that South Peak rushed to get this game out before this Christmas. Play it, you will see. The graphics are somewhat better then Racing for Home, but the controls of the cars are worse. The sound is bad, you need to put your tv up all all the way to hear anything & perhaps the most upsetting is, they damn game loads RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYING. What is that about? In my own opinion, Racing for Home is much better."
3,There was no seal !!!,Well it looks oK. but i feel bad. There was no seal on the top after removed the cap. Normally there was seal if this is new one. Who is going to understand this is new?
3,Doesn't live up to the hype...,"I have to admit that I was disappointed with The Warlord after reading the uniformly glowing reviews. All-in-all a pretty vanilla military fiction tale, and not even these authors' best stuff. The Prince by Stirling and Pournelle was better from a military fiction standpoint IMO, and Stirling's Island on the Sea of Time managed to combine civil and military plots that were better than this. Heck, even Weber's Empire from the Ashes did the ""ancient battle computer"" plot better than the cold, inhuman number cruncher in this one.Hopefully the series builds from here, but certainly not 4+-star worthy stuff to this point."
3,Really wanted to like this. . .,I have read many of Stirlings other books so picked this series up expecting an enjoyable read. It just wasn't. Didn't like the characters especially the main one and just found the whole premise flat.
3,Like swimming in jello,"I love Peggy Noonan but this was not her best book. It has wonderful scenes, fantastic chapters and is so good in places and then she seems to get lost and goes on and on with fairly boring stuff. I can only assume that it was unedited. Also, she tends to play the wide eyed innocent too much. This woman worked in the White House and lives in NYC-- you can't survive in either place and still be a babe in the woods. The scene where she goes to Jack Kemp's party and behaves like a yokel was pure smaltz and sacarhine. It was laid on too thick--like a pool of jello and I didn't believe it. What I Saw at the Revolution was a much better book and it's one I go back to again and again. I'm chalking this one up to the fact that every writer has a bad literary day sooner or later."
1,Very disappointing!,"This album contains songs recorded at a Ray Conniff concert in Brazil. The sound quality is poor compared to other Conniff live-tour albums.Ray Conniff fans are better off buying 'S Always Conniff which was recorded during a tour of Japan in 1991. The performance, sound, and repertoire on that CD is excellent.'S Always Conniff contains twice as many songs for less money and also includes a fold out showing Conniff's entire album discography with photographs and other interesting information."
1,Don't Buy,"They say ""If it breaks, we replace it by sending you a check for the amount you paid, including tax."" but that excludes:-accidents due to accident misuse abuse-collision vandalism theft-the elements or acts of god-defects due to the millenium bug or the year 2000 problem-invasion, war, act of foreign enemy, rebellion, riot-non functional aesthetic parts-damge rusting or warping to the caseing-damage caused by a computer virus-damage happening to the item before the issue date of the policy-damage occuring while being repaired at the repair centerit does cover-deffects in the workmanship and/or materials.read the terms and conditions, dont waste your money"
1,What a Joke,"Tried to envoke this when daughter's mp3 player quit and it was so complicated and there were so many loopholes. They wanted money to look at it even though the replacement plan was purchased. Trying to reach a person to talk to was impossible. Finally took it to Best Buy who even though we did not purchase it there, bent over backwards to help us!"
1,RIP OFF.,"This is A RIP off, I cannot believe that Amazon allows these criminals to offer this product on their website. THEY DO NOT ALLOW anything to be covered and basically if you read the terms and conditions, they charge you $x and then use that money to hire people to find ways to get out of paying you any portion of a warranty. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. THEY ARE A SCAM. I have reported them to the consumer report bureau as they are cheaters and crooks."
4,Beastmaster turned Vampire,"This is a vampire movie with the interesting twist of the illuminati pulling the strings. Daniel Goddard is excellent (and hot). It might be vampire-light for some vampire fans, but it is all the more watchable for less hard core fans of the genre."
1,It's all been done before,"There's nothing new here. A vampire craves to return to humanity so he can be with a new-found love, and view the sunrise.The vampires are pathetic. They stand around the vampire hunters for a few moments hissing, bearing their fangs, theatening you with their hands as if they're going to claw you, but they don't have claws. All with enough time so a hunter can take aim with his weapon and take one of them out.Even charging at one with a long pointed stick is enough. You don't even need to get the vampire in the heart."
4,Amusing,"The opera scene with the opera singer was a wonderful opening for this film. I am not a big vampire fan, but I thought parts of the movie were well done and entertaining. I enjoyed some of the costumes and locations used for scenes."
3,Worth watching,This was fun! Vampire movies are pretty predictable - but this is creepy and scary just the same. The opera singer is fabulous.
2,"Not the worst vampire movie I've seen, but within kissing distance of it","Kiss of the Vampire looked tempting, and it opened with hope. It seemed they spent well on locations, camera equipment, and actors. If only they'd have also spent for a decent script, and maybe some editing. Not the worst vampire flick I've seen, but within kissing distance of the worst."
1,"Terrible, low budget, drawn out movie","It was awful. I expected it to be. The only reason I paid money for it is because I was born and raised in the town it was filmed in. (Hamilton, Ohio)"
1,Some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie,"Seriously....everyone featured in the film, their careers are basically over. The acting was so bad it was comical. The only one that did a halfway reasonable job was the one midget who has been in a whole bunch of similar films (example, Bordello of Blood). This is the type of movie that would be made fun of on Mystery Science Theatre 3000."
5,Raw rock and roll--fantastic CD,"Marshall Crenshaw rocks. This is an excellent CD. The sound issimple and raw. It sounds like Buddy Holly. The opening track""Wild One"" will have you turning up the volume. Another greattrack ""I'm sorry but so is Brenda Lee"" This is just good music"
4,Popular wisdom has Marshall Crenshaw's first album,"for Warner Bros. as his crowning glory. In my book, this one is nearly as good. Perhaps because it has a number of producer credits, it sounds more varied. The highlight is the bittersweet gem, ""Blues Is King."" If jangly guitars, power pop hooks and lovelorn lyrics are your thing, this is a good value."
4,Downtown is worth a look,"While I do not enjoy Downtown as much as Mary Jean & 9 Others and the self-titled debut...I must say there is still lots of good stuff here. Marshall turned off the compression machine after Field Day and put out a good little rockabilly, country, power pop album here! I really think Marshall needs to embrace what made him so endearing and get back to his guitar orientated, rockin', Buddy Hollyish ways...his last couple of albums have been awful (see: #447 and What's In The Bag?) He should put out an album that takes elements from the first album, Mary Jean, and Miracle of Science...add a Buddy Holly cover tune and whoolah!!! Marshall would win over the masses!!Steve O."
2,CD,Can't really say as I never used it. I liked the idea of it but ended up going to the Goodwill one day....
3,A Good intro but leaves out important facts,"I like the style. The contents in outline form, maps and capsule coverage of each topic.The Nicene Creed should have been covered and the argument with the Filioque clause.Some discussion of the Liturgy would have been nice and its similarity to the Jewish Service."
5,Youth of the Beast,"An audacious early outing from cult Japanese director Seijun Suzuki and the Nikkatsu studio, ""Beast"" is a hip, pulp-gangster flick with a twisty revenge plot involving murder, dope, go-go dancers, and salacious double crosses. (One kingpin even has a gay brother who slashes the face of anyone mentioning his mother!) With its surreal color palette, bizarre set pieces, and rapid cuts, the film has a unique visual flair--not to mention a killer crime-jazz score. And as the cop-turned-crook out for payback, Shishido is as hard-boiled as they come. For a lurid spin on the yakuza genre, unleash the ""Beast."""
4,Excellent resource,THis was a comprehensive look at Family Therapy. THis will become part of my library. It is a great resource. Easy read.
1,returned book,"Not much to say, I returned both books because you were higher in price than another source. Also, I got two books because you gave me no indication that the purchase was completed. You should review your internet ordering methods. I clicked one button ordering and never knew if it had taken or not, so I did it again, therefore, getting two books. Then I found a cheaper source and returned your books. Fix the thing and I will order again. I have ordered several books in the past, so I'm not new to this, just new to bad service by you prople and your method of one click ordering."
1,mariachi lite,bought this on recommendation of other online reviewers...sorry i did...far too much orchestration for my tastes.
4,If Stevie were present on this album it would be a classic,"This is a wonderful album with some classic songs by LB and CV, however what's missing is Stevie Nicks who was going through major drug issues at the time. She only contributes 3 songs and they are very mediocre, her voice sounds awful. Go buy Say You Will if you want to hear her sound the way she's supposed to sound! Lindsey's songs like Big Love, Caroline and Family Man are all excellent and Christine McVie's Everywhere is a classic."
4,..Listen To The Wind On The Water,"If many compare Tusk to The Beatles white album,than TITN is their Abbey Road.Although nobody forsaw Lindsey Buckingham's departure,this album sounds like the classic line-ups swan song.Unfortunately Stevie Nicks only contributes three song(due to a certain problem which led to a stint at rehab)Seven Wonders is her best song since Dreams and Sara.Buckingham as usual dominates the album.But this time his contributions(Big Love,Family Man,the title song)sounds as crisp as the albums production.Christine McVie's Everywhere and Little Lies display a duribility as they are endlessly played on radio.Although there is a fair share of weak material(Caroline,the generic Isn't It Midnight)the crisp production make this their best sounding album,although not the best."
2,The last album from classic Mac,"Fleetwood Mac never again came close to replicating the success of their massive hit album ""Rumours,"" and by the time this album rolled around ten years later they had pretty much exhuasted their creative collaberation. Though most of ""Tango in the Night"" is a pleasent listen, it lacks the emotional edge of their best work. In fact, after a few listens, it is utterly forgettable. Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham left the band after the release of ""Tango,"" which effective ended the era of ""Rumours."""
1,BLEAH!,"This is the absolute worst FM album ever. Lindsey's songs are saggy and Stevie Nicks is a sad case of a gorgeous voice turned into a shredded croak after years of wrong singing. Her song ""When I see you again"" is painful to listen to with lyrics like ""and you stare at the stairs, ooh there are many things to stare at these days"". The only shining star here is Christine McVie with her golden voice and soulful songs. My ONE star goes to her."
4,Great Fleetwood Mac,"This is a little more modern for Fleetwood Mac, but you can't mistake that it is them and it is a great CD, good songs and melodies which they are well known for."
4,Great Listening,"I first had this album on cassette, this is first class from Fleetwood Macthe vocals of Lindsay, Stevie are excellent, the guitar work is superb, I rate this album one of there best & not given the attention it should of,enjoy."
4,One of a kind...,"This 1987 Fleetwood Mac effort,in spite of the critics and their prejudices,is a terrific collection of songs,one of a kind,in terms of power,beauty and inspiration.They don't make it like that anymore!"
4,Tango In The Night,"5. Tango In The Night: With the release of ""Tango In The Night"" in the summer of 1987, it marked a stellar return for the band that hadn't released anything since 1982's ""Mirage"". While Lindsey Buckingham did not tour with the band he did produce the record with long-time Mac collaborator Richard Dashut and they done a good job for the most part. Big Love and Everywhere are the only real misfires (Better heard live on ""The Dance"") The tracks are all over the map with a great Mac song called ""Seven Wonders"" and another good one called ""Little Lies"". Stevie succeeds with ""Welcome To The Room... Sara"" a song with a profound lyrics and great rhythm. Lindsey even gets his trademark Guitar solos with the albums title track which features a great guitar solo from Lindsey. Unfortunately it was to be his last Mac Album. ."
4,Last Chance,"At least before Fleetwood Mac disintegrated, Christine McVie redeemed herself. Her work here is worth the price of the album - rocking hard (""Isn't It Midnight"") breaking your heart (""Little Lies"") and charming you (""Everywhere""). Buckingham's two bookend songs ""Big Love"" and ""You and I"" are pretty good too. Stevie Nicks' contributions are just awful, though. But that's what they invented the ""program"" button on your CD player for, right! And on Family man, Buckingham really slums for lyrics (""I fall down - I get up"" - profound!) The sound here is more electronic aural candy + extras (classical guitar!) that you expect from FM."
3,A Surprising Blockbuster,"I remember when this album came out in 1987 I was thrilled just to have some new music by my favorite band in the world. Once the thrill wore off, however, I was able to see the many shortcomings of this album. While most of the songs are pleasant, the overall effect is rather bland. Christine McVie is consistent as ever with ""Everywhere,"" ""Is'nt it Midnight,"" and ""Little Lies,"" and Lindsey Buckingham contributes the effective ""Big Love,"" and ""Caroline."" The most surprising aspect of this album (and the most disappointing) is the poor quality of Stevie Nicks' songs. ""Seven Wonders"" is merely adequete while ""Welcome to the Room Sara"" is rife with recycled lyrics from her far superior 1981 song ""Blue Lamp."" The biggest dud is the ballad ""When I See You Again,"" on which Stevie sounds awful and is further hampered by horrible lyrics. She obviously thought this song was touching and emotional but it succeeds only in sounding pathetic."
5,Nice!,"Lovely rythm's great lyrics and just sweet to drift away with, one of the best fleetwood mac albums in my opinion."
4,Buy The Hard Cover 10 Edition from Record Research,"This is a good account of Top 100 Billboard Songs with the Artists. In fact, it is the best book in the popular music business. You should buy the most up to date hard cover version. Record Research on Joel Whitburn's own publishing arm will sell you the 10th edition. It is tough to purchase across border in Canada. The makes my first choice to purchase from Amazon. But they can't or won't deliver. I have purchased directly from Record Research in the USA and Top Pop Singles 1955 - 2002 will be worth the wait. The Hard Cover edition will also allow you years of enjoyment for referencing and looking up your favourite songs and artists."
3,"Could be better, but is very popular in Latin discos!","I'm a DJ myself, and I'm from Cuba, but grew up in Angola and Mozambique, so I'm into Brazilian music. This one is quite commercial, and can get VERY monotonous. But it's excellent for a Latinamerican dancing club, to play when the dancing floor is ""hot"" and you want to keep people there. If you're learning the SAMBA, buy it! If you're looking for good Brazilian music....don't."
5,Perfect -,"Only comes with one cover, and works perfectly - as long as you order the fancy theft prevention screws."
5,Full coverage!,"This product covers the WHOLE plate. It isn't just a faceplate. It literally covers everything so dirt, mud, gunk don't get in. Very nice!"
3,not water resistant,"very good at keeping bugs off of my new designed tag but water still runs down, it's a ok item but hoped it would of done the job on protecting my plate"
1,Thick and awkward,"This cover cannot be used with a ""trim ring"". Seems its designed to be used by itself. It is so thick and poorly designed around the edges, you must use longer than normal screws/bolts to hold it in place. The plastic is very easily scratched as well. Just a simple wcleaning wipe with a soft towel will scratch the surface. Cant see this one lasting very long."
5,The best you can buy!,"This is not the flimsy, crappy protector, it is firm, strong and has molding that supports strength. It's clear, are works sxcellent in all types of protection!"
3,Great until it was broken.,"Did someone back into me? Did I hit something? Anyway, a very good product until now... it cracked. Maybe that is why it says ""recommended for off road use"" (where there are not that many cars?).Getting a replacement but no looking for one that is ""unbreakable""."
1,poor quality sink,"This is a poor quality sink. At first it was a wonderful sink. I loved the shape and depth of it. But in 2 to 3 weeks I started noticing that it is getting scratched very easily. I purchased a protective mat for the bottom of the sink, but it is still getting scratched. Now we are trying to get a refund from the company, at least partial refund. But company demanding to send a sink in otherwise we not going to receive any money back. The problem is we installed this sink underneath granite, so we had to cut a special shaped opening out the granite. Now I cannot find another sink what would have the same shape and dimensions. I think I am stuck with this horrible thing. Please, save yourself money and aggravation, do not purchase this product."
2,Large disconnect.,"As an undergrad who was forced to take a class with a professor who contributed to this book as a grad student, all I can say is that there is a large disconnect between the text and exercises. I also found the book to be ambiguous, maybe because the farther along you go the terser it gets. It also needs more theoretical examples, not just computational ones."
3,"Billy, Where Did You Go Wrong?","The people who enjoyed ""Let the Little Girl Dance"" for the most part are probably not even into oldies these days. It was I believe 44 years ago as I write this. It was a teen favorite and often heard on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. The follow-up ""Pardon Me"" was a non-performer. Billy Bland had a voice similar to Clyde McPhatter's and/or Dee Clark's but I don't recall a ripple after ""Pardon Me"". Perhaps he tried to get into the dance crazes that Chubby Checker started with his version of Hank Ballard's ""The Twist"". Alas, ""Do the Bug With Me"" did not catch on. If you can find ""Let the Little Girl Dance"" on a compilation of various artists cheaper, go for it."
3,Business Decisions,Makes you take a step back and really think about your decisions. I recommend this book to anyone who needs clarification about any decisions they make.
4,Good book,Informative and useful book. Used for MBA classes and passed it along to another managers for answers to the questiones about some choices in their trade. Highly recommend.
1,Disappointed,"When you pay close to retail for a ""almost new"" book you expect to get a first rate book. Instead I got a book that has pages out of order."
1,This can't be Portland's best...,Man I baught this CD cause I got much luv 4 Portland and It's like my second home sence I spent every summer there for the past 10 years...So I swooped this thinkin I was gon here some tight Portland Rap...But this is the worst CD I have EVER heard...First off there isn't even one good beat on this album...Second the concepts for the songs are horrible...The hooks suk...I am hella disapointed because I know Cool Nutz can flow...If I was you I wouldn't even waste my money on swoopin this album...I'ma try Maniak Lok next hopefully he paks some heat...
5,Unbelievably good!,"What a great CD! The production is fantastic (thankfully). I was afraid that some of the songs might lose something when performed live, but that was not the case at all. Very, very brutal stuff!"
3,This Is A 2 QT. NOT A 3 QT.,"I purchased this from a seller on ebay. When I received it, I knew it was only a 2 qt. not the 3 qt. they advertised !. I see the same mistake is being made here. The seller on Ebay would not make good on it either. They told me I could send it back, that they would pay for the return shipping, however , refused to pay back the 8.00 for the first shipping expense to get item to me. So, either way, I was .... I kept it, not happy with it either. It is a cheaply made one."
2,The only reason I finished it was that Susan Isaacs wrote it,"I really had to force myself to finish this book. I am a big fan of Susan Isaacs, and have read every one of her books, but this one left me cold. When I had only 50 pages left, I still almost put it down. I understand the reasoning behind the two parts of the book, but if what Ms. Isaacs was trying to do was help us understand the main characters, Charlie and Lauren, then how come I did not feel that I really knew Lauren at all? She was not a well-drawn character - the way that her mother, grandmother, etc. were portrayed. I also was pretty surprised that they hopped into bed so quickly - that was really a letdown - without any real tension buildup. I don't really think that the two parts of the book flowed well together. why spend so much time with the prior characterizations, when the main characters are total unknowns? This didn't make any sense to me. Well, keep trying, Susan."
2,Two books pieced together as one.,"I have been a fan of Susan Isaacs and have read all of her previous books. However, what was she thinking with this one? or two as it were? The first half was about so many generations of these two families it was so hard to keep straight, and quite frankly, what was the point? The second half was a completely different story. Granted, these two main characters of the second half were related (third cousins???), but it was not an integral part of their story. I was very disappointed by this book. I would tell anyone who wants to read it to just start halfway through because that is where the real storyline begins."
2,Aren't They cousins or something????,"This was my first Susan Isaacs book. I got it for free, otherwise I wouldn't have read it. It was okay, but I'm a little troubled by the fact that the two love interests are cousins. Otherwise it was a somewhat weak book. I liked the NYC parts, it was fun to follow. But the Wyoming stuf..... ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ And the Wrath people were cliches."
3,"silly, comicbook characters, movie script obvious","This book is a poorly fleshed out,silly story of a cowboy and a Jewish liberal girl---how together they defeat neo-nazi morons. It is a good book to read on an airline.You can skip the first half of the book and complete the rest in a flight from N.Y. to Wyoming, where the book is set. Suffice it to know that the couple have great-great-great grandparents in common. It's kind of like Barry Goldwater meets Barbara Streisand in the movie, The Way We Were. Definitely a Book of the Month Club pick."
2,I had to force myself to finish it.,"I have long been a fan of Susan Isaacs, and was de- lighted to hear of her new book. I found it to be dull beyond words. The characters, both the good and bad guys, had great potential for being developed into people about whom I would care, but it was as if Ms. Isaacs herself found them uninteresting,too. I plodded through this book, expecting at every chapter change to start being mesmerized by it. It never happened, never even came close. I finished it only because I felt like I should."
3,"OK, not her best","Like other reviewers, I am a die hard Susan Isaacs fan and when I noted on Amazon that she had one scheduled to be released, I made sure I got it almost while the ink was still wet. Maybe it's because my tastes have changed since her last book, but I found this one quite unsatisfactory. The women are all beautiful and vivacious and they all either get their men or get even or both. I enjoyed the family history portion of this book, but found the undercover part draggy. The way she portrayed Charlie and Lauren as American heroes left me quite unmoved. As far as I can tell, Charlie worked for the FBI and they both came from immigrant stock. Just like millions of other Americans. Also, the manner in which they immediately fell in love and into bed struck me as just a bit on the contrived side. Susan, please listen to your reviewers and write us another one!"
2,Whats the point???,"This book must have been about something, but I couldn't figure out what. Susan Isaacs is capable of much more than this. I was very disappointed."
3,Disappointing considering her previous work,"I have enjoyed almost all of Ms. Isaacs' works and was eagerly looking forward to this one. I was rather disappointed. The first half was as I'd expected, an enjoyable read with interesting characters and story line. The second half, getting into the main characters, seemed dragged out as well as predictable. Perhaps she captured all too well the boredom of undercover work, because I found the scenes with the extremist organization and the FBI guy undercover to be interminable. I ended up skipping large chunks of the last quarter of the book in order to finally finish it."
3,A Beach Read - not one of her better works,"I adore this author. Unfortunately, this novel did not measure up to the high standard that she has set for herself. With that in mind, I still recommend this book.The author skips from generation to generation just as the characters become interesting and you want to learn more about them. She didn't really take the time to look at how the generations could have been introduced in a better manner. I found that to be rather fustrating.Also, she goes on page after page attempting to explain the thinking behind these seperatist groups. It was boring and not in the least bit insightful.If Isaacs wanted to write a novel about seperatists, than that's what she should have done and left the romance and previous generations out of it."
2,not up to snuff,"I've thoroughly enjoyed Susan Isaacs' previous novels which are marked by sharp and sometimes caustic wit, spunky and sympathetic protagonists and engaging plot lines. This one just doesn't compare. If this is your first encounter with Ms. Isaacs' work, I'd urge you to give her another shot."
1,Disappointing,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed all of Ms Isaac's previous works, I eagerly looked forward to this new one. Having just finished it, I can hardly believe it was written by Ms Isaacs, who's ""Lily White"" was a true joy, as were her other wonderful works. The difference between ""R,W, and B"" and all the other novels is startling.""R,W, and B"" starts out good, going back in time and telling stories of long ago. This was the best part of the book, the most interesting, and the most Isaac-like. The second half, the Wyoming-FBI-terrorism part, must have been written by a ghost writer. There was no mystery, no depth of character, no surprises. It was almost embarassing to read, it was so awful. It was not possible to care about the two main characters, who were just too perfect. The shoot-out scene on the deserted road was nauseating while at the same time so implausable.I look forward to Ms Isaac's next book, because it can only be an improvement."
1,Forced myself to keep reading until the end,I should have known when I realized the book they were reviewing on the back cover as wonderful was her Lily White and not this one. I have read a few of her books which I enjoyed but this one put me to sleep. I could not keep track of who was who and tie it in to the second half of the story. I was glad to finally get it done. It all was very predictable at the finish.
2,One unit - Not a 6-pack,"Be warned - this is one unit of three 6inch boxes. That means over $10 per 6inch space made of plastic and wire. It is an absurd price for what you get. Why do they charge more than for the 13inch units? Why call it a 6-pack? 18 boxes would have been a reasonable value. Rip-off!! I gave it 2 stars because it actually looks kind of cool, but I'll be looking somewhere else to find a CD storage solution."
4,Amazon Footsmart Diabetic Socks,These socks do stay up & are high quality. I wish the material (cotton) would be a little thinner. I have deep marks on my feet after taking them off. They do help with swelling but are too thick.
2,Bad Connection!?,I have had this TV for about 2 years now and serveral months ago I noticed a problem with the cable we had connected to the TV. After several hours of use the picture would develop wavy lines of static that would eventually make the TV unwhatchable. I've tried switching out the cable box the VCR even the coaxial cable the picture still deteriorates after no more than 5 hours of use. The use of the VCR tends to speed the occurence of the problem and can obliterate the picture in roughly 4 hours. Also when whatching cable TV I have noticed ghosts in the picture. I have tried switching cable boxes with the TV in the other room but the problem persits. I would like to belive that the problem is with the cable but after discussing the matter with several of my chums who were pleased with the cable on the next street I ruled that out.I am disapointed with this TV.
3,It rather hurts to write this...,"Paul Shanklin has got to be one of the most brilliant satirists alive today, and a huge vocal talent considering all the voices he can do, so it pains me to write that there's nothing on this CD that I'll want to listen to again, having just heard it all the way through.I own just about all the Shanklin CDs, and it seem that on every one until now there's always been at least one or two songs that are just bust-a-gut funny because the spoof-lyrics are as well written (rhyme and meter wise) as the lyrics of the song that is being spoofed.Not so true this time. There are some great ideas that are not exploited to their full potential, like ""Leutenant Kerry's Purple Hearts Club Band"". What a great idea! However, the lyrics are jerky, sort of awkward, and not as clever as I've grown to expect from a Paul Shanklin production.This CD was surely good for a laugh, but sadly only once."
2,Not the writer I remember,"I love John Irving's earlier works, like a Prayer for Owen Meany, The Hotel New Hampshire, and even Son of the Circus, but this one is a difficult read, not so much because of the material, which he's touched on so many times before (to the point that I cringe when I read about these things), but out of sheer boredom. It got boring. Isn't that a cardinal sin for any writer? It had no momentum to carry me through it, and in the end I put it down far more often than most books. Where are the sympathetic characters whom I loved despite their quirks. Please tell them to come back. I'm not sure if I recommend this book or not."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a John Irving fan for ages, but I have to say that this novel just didn't do it for me."
2,Not Up to Par,I am a huge John Irving fan and have read all of his books - some multiple times. I have to admit I was disappointed in Until I Find You. The story went on and on and on and didn't really say anything. Some parts of the book contained flashes of John Irving's humor and style but most of the book was just dragged out for no reason. I didn't like the ending and the story it told was disconnected. It's a shame to wait all this time for him to publish a new book only to have it be so disappointing. Pass on this one and reread The Cider House Rules or A Prayer for Owen Meanie.
2,I hate to bash a John Irving book....,"but good gosh, how many penis references can you have in one book? It was almost a joke and became so boring. Who wants to read so much about a penis being fondled?I've read everything by J Irving and love him but the last two books have really done nothing for me. What happened to the fun?"
4,"hey, not his best, but still VERY GOOD","John will be John, the best story teller of the 20th Century. I really enjoyed the book."
5,A True American Epic,"The life, or cookie-cutter aspect of something not remotely close to actual lives, of the actor Jack Burns (who did hold his mother's hand) is utterly fascinating and a true work of compelling, modern fiction. Beyond the plot that meshed together from beginning to end, beyond the acute observations of Jack and his women, and finally the loss of Emma - this book succeeded in ways I thought it never could from the flap. Compelling from the first chapter and spellbinding until the emotional ending, Jack Burns made his journey through life in an amazing epic of the written American word."
3,I Tried! Honest.ly.,"I'm a huge fan of John Irving's and I really tried to get through this book but I just couldn't read it. What a disappointment! I had waited so long for this novel but I found it to be dense and boring, totally lacking Irving's usual humor and kinkiness.In the book's defense, clearly he spent an inordinate amount of time writing the book, researching and creating his characters. I'm sorry that it couldn't hold my interest because I can't think of any of his other books that I put down without finishing.Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road"
1,Very Disappointing,"As a long time John Irving fan, I found this book very disappointing. I probably wouldn't have stayed with it as long as I did if it hadn't been for my past enjoyment of his other works. The first section of Jack and his mother moving from town to town working in tattoo parlors got a bit repetitive. Then, with young Jack at the Girl's school for grade's one thru four along with the older school girls' mistreatment and abuse, it became uncomfortable to read. The last straw was when the older babysitter raped him. At that point, I decided not to continue.I read fiction as a form of entertainment. John Irving has written some really good novels. From a social and personal perspective, this is not one of them."
1,Until I Find You by John Irving,"A prurient claptrack of unrealistic, repetitious, and overblown writing contained in 816 unreadable pages. It was a good book to finish!"
1,Disappointed,"After having read a fair number of John Irving's earlier novels, I was disappointed with the cardboard characters in this one and the endless elaboration on pointless details. Not once did I get to feel any identification with the main characters. I literally struggled through the 500+ pages of the hardback version.Apart from Toronto, Maine and LA, the book describes scenes in Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Zurich and Mr Irving has gone through great pains to insert local insiders info, rendering the book into something of a tourist guide. The author indulges here in a writer's trick to add interestingness to the novel, which I found irritating.The subject matter is fashionable, and only that, and as thin as the paper is was printed on.I would not recommend this novel."
2,Disturbing,"I can appreciate the author's talent, but I could not get past the endless, graphic child abuse. I got the message the first 5 times it happened, but he was abused by basically every woman/girl he came into contact with. It was too disturbing for me. This is the first Irving novel I have read and don't know if I will be able to try another."
2,Self-Indulgent!,"I have to agree with the editorial reviews who say this is definitely not John Irving's best work. I have read all of his novels, and I suppose when you have the reputation that he rightfully has, it's hard for one's own editors and publishers to criticize you. However, at least 200 pages could have been cut from this. Self-indulgent is the best description I could give it. At the end I was left feeling like I just didn't ""get it"". Irving's prior works usually contain characters most describe as eccentric. This book leads me to believe he's forgotten that the audience has to care about the characters, and that while the author may feel that you can't describe things fully enough, there is something to be said for ""less is more""!"
1,Done with Irving.,"After the monstrously bad ""Fourth Hand"" and now this grotesque piece of writing, one has to wonder if Garp, Cider House Rules, Owen Meany and Widow for One Year exhausted Irving's reservoir of talent. The resonance of echoed phrases such as ""beware the undertoad"" are now supplanted by annoying tics - ""not in front of Jack,"" ""the little guy,"" and ""baby cakes."" There is no depth in or empathy for these characters. Perhaps Irving's eleventh-hour decision to hastily rewrite in the third person was a mistake - perhaps the work, from Jack's point of view...no matter how personally painful for Irving...would have been more engaging and would have eliminated his annoying need to explain and deconstruct every action or thought for us. After persevering for 300 pages, I threw this book down in disgust. Luckily, I'm a neat reader and was able to return my copy for full credit at Borders. (Review updated so as not to be anonymous)"
2,Disappointing and disturbing,"The first 100 pages were good, typical Irving. Then it was almost like someone else was writing it. It was missing all of the cleverness and witt of his earlier novels. I was left with a bunch of whiny characters that I did not like. Reading about a child being sexually abused once would have been enough, but for some reason this child was abused by almost every girl or woman he met. I found that very disturbing and it made me wonder just what happened to Irving in his childhood to write such a story. I do not recommend it at all."
2,This One was a Disappointment,"I love John Irving. I've read at least a dozen of his books, and he's one of the few authors that I've bothered to check out the website of. But, in my opinion, this was not a very good book. At all. It was the slowest moving stories I have read in a long time. I didn't think I would ever reach the end, and got no satisfaction when I finally did. The story is funky, like much of Irving's works, but very dark in nature and not memorable. A few weeks after reading it, I couldn't even describe the story to a friend. All I could remember was tattoos, organ music, and transvestites."
1,"Until I find You, by John Irving","This was truly one of the most disgusting, perverted, and outlandish books I've read. None of the characters had redeeming qualities, the story line was ridiculous and didn't hold together, and the book should have been edited from 800+ pages to 150 pages. Don't read the book; it's not worth doing so. This is another John Irving book focusing on perverted sex, prostitutes and ridiculous story lines.Until I Find You"
4,as someone who doesnt own a tv....,"i look forward to books of length & scope.john irving's voice is john irving's voice.it speaks to you, or not.i find it presumptuous for readers torate the books ""before"" garp or ""after""owen meany. what have YOU written lately?try not to be such a critic...enjoy being a reader.and if you're pissed about spending the bucks,go to your public library."
2,Ghost of Robertson Davies morphing into porn?,I'm about 200 pages into this book and I have to say I detected strong notes of Robertson Davies during the European stage of the story. I would be willing to bet Irving had recently read the Depthford Trilogy around the time Until We Meet Again was being formulated.After that I find this book really descends into softcore porn. The age of Jack during his first sexual (abusive?) experiences is a bit disturbing. Not sure I'm going to finish this one.Bottom line is disappointment. The brilliance of Owen Meany will keep me trying every Irving book that comes out but this is one I'm likely to spit out.
3,Until I Find You: A Novel,I have to say I purchased this book about a year ago and still haven't been able to get into it. It must be my frame of mind these last two cancer filled years. I may try again during the summer while I am sitting on the patio relaxing. I have heard so many wonderful things about it and must find my way into what everyone else can see.
3,Almsot worthy of four stars,"I'll start by saying I enjoyed this book. the whole tattoo culture intrigued me and kept my interset up. The tales of abuse seemed a bit overdone to me. i found it hard to beleive that nobody would have noticed and intervened on behalf of the child. Some might argue Emma did this for Jack but to me she was just as guilty. The best parts of the book were Jack's trips overseas. Overall a worthy read. Not at the top of my recommend list, but on the list nevertheless."
4,"Intimidating length, suprisingly good","It's been a while since I wrote a review. I felt compelled to comment on this one, however. This is my first John Irving. I read the article in ""Pages"" and became interested in reading this book. I had no idea it was 820 pages long. When I got it off reserve from the library, I was floored. To be honest, I felt the story kind of dragged for most of the first half. The book started to get really good around page 600. From that point on, I couldn't put it down. Previous reviews have pretty much summed up the details of the story. A sad one but with a happy ending."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"First let me begin by saying that John Irving is one of my favorite authors. I read some of his other books time and time again and give them out as gifts.That being said, I did not like a Widow for One Year, or The Fourth Hand (Irving's two prior novels). However, the strength of Cider House Rules and A Prayer for Owen Meaney made me pre-order this book.Being a true Irving fan, I stuck with this to the bitter end. Unfortunately Irving has become formulaic and, at times, tedious. I did not like the prostitution themes or the tatoo ones. They were boring and contrived and really did not contribute to the novel.Irving did have some flashes of brilliance (his character, Emma) but they were too few and far between to keep even the most ardent fan reading."
3,Not the best Irving,"Though I dearly love Irving and have read all of his books, I very nearly stopped reading this one before I was finished. The first third of this 800+ page book is just disturbing in a way that seemed needless. The repetitive abuse at the hands of older women happens so often, and the reader never really understands why. Irving's treatment of difficult subjects in his past novels has been honest and not gratuitous, but I'm afraid I can't say the same for this one. Once I finally got past the first 300 pages, the book became more what I would expect from Irving, and I couldn't put it down. The development of Jack as an adult is so rich and worth getting through the first part of the novel. If you've not read Irving before, start with the Hotel New Hampshire, World According to Garp, or Cider House Rules, please, but not this one."
3,A Meandering Tale,"John Irving's latest novel is nothing more, or less, than a meandering tale of attempted self-realization by the protagonist Jack Burns. There are ancillary characters who weave in and out of his life and shed some illumination into what comprises his personality; however, there really is no finality or ultimate conclusion to this book. It simply just stops (and many would say that after 820 pages...about time!) Granted, this book is long - but anybody reading it knows that before starting it. Irving writes well, and there is some interesting social commentary through the usage of metaphors. It simply the plot that is somewhat lacking. Its not a horrible book, nor is it a great book. Its just 820 pages of meandering prose."
2,Truly Dull and Soooo Long,"John Irving is one of my top 5 favorite writers of all time. I'm thrilled every time he writes a new book and can't wait to read it. This one, for some reason, I bought but didn't read for over a year. Then when I started it, I wished I hadn't.It's self-indulgent, mind-numbingly boring and needs an editor sooooo badly (why is it so many publishers allow their famous writers to ramble on with no editing? It's like they're afraid to edit them!) Such a disappointment, and the worst Irving book I've read. Please please please Mr. Irving, hire a good editor for your next one because, if I have to read another one this awful, it will be the last book of yours I buy :("
1,800 pages of bizarreness & boredom,"Where was the editor to prevent this ""opus"" from having NO waistline?????"
2,John! You let me down!,"I've been a big Irving fan, pre-GARP. I used to enjoy how he'd defend his earlier work when everyone was singing GARP'S praises. He has since changed his approach, giving GARP credit for allowing him the financial freedom to have the luxury of time to invest in his books, allowing him the latitude to write the books he wants to write leisurely. So, how does he explain this overblown exercise? I became, sadly, bored by the hero's sex life before he had even turned 14. The world that tattoo artists occupy was much better realized in last year's THE ELECTRIC MICHAELANGELO (although I did like the phrase, ""sleeping in the needles."") But this is a week I will never get back again. This also reminds of the later books of James Michener, which didn't show any sign of an editor's pencil. Has Irving reached a point where his publishers' feel every word he writes is golden and worthy of inclusion? This may have been a wonderful 200 page book, but it is a lousy one for 800 pages."
1,Until I Find You,"I was hoping that John Irvings new novel would be better than his last ""The Fourth Hand"". What a disappointment, after reading all 800 pages I wish I would have put it away after the first 100 pages. This is the worst of all his writings and does not compare to ""World According to Garp"", ""Hotel New Hampshire"" or ""Cider House Rules"". This story could have been told in 300 pages and saved a whole lot of people time that they will never get back."
4,Genius,"Irving only gets better and better. His ability to take subject matter of this nature and tell a tale so comically and tenderly that you have nothing but sympathy for his characters, utterly amazes me. Though half way through the book, Burns' interaction with women become rather predictable, I never wanted to stop turning the pages. This book reassures me that no matter how insignificant a casual encounter may seem, the impact on the other person/s life can last a lifetime. Healing takes time, and Irving made Burns' last 800 pages! If he ever hopes that his writings have shock value, he will be sadly disappointed as his loyal readers come to expect his quirky, sexually deviant characters and we will keep coming back for more of them."
2,Is this Irving or a teenage boy's sick dream? Pathetic.,"If you enjoy unbelievable stories about young boys who seem to have all of the girls over the age of 13 molesting him and waiting for his puberty to hit, you may like this story. I, on the other hand, did not. The characters are more than the usual flawed Irving characters. To summarize, it's a near child pornography saga and is filled with female characters who simply would never exist. Truly a disapointment."
2,Did Not Like,"A friend recommended this book. I had a very hard time reading it due to all of the child sexual abuse. In fact, I skipped the middle portion and jumped to the end to find out what actually happened to him."
2,Not his best,Irving needs a new editor. Many chapters could be cut to a few paragraphs - Zurich would be my first choice to get out the scissors.
4,Classic Irving,"John Irving doesn't disapoint with his latest book. though it is a bit slow at times I came to feel as if the characters were as real as the world around me. As a reviewer before me said, I felt as if I had just completed an emotional journey."
2,Where Has Mr. Irving Gone?,The best character in this book for me was Mr.RamseyJACK BURNS! Every one else was holding someones penis for800 pages.
2,"Love Irving, but not this one","I am a John Irving fan, but not about this book. I read the entire book in not too much time. But, I kept hoping that it would get better. In the beginning I was disturbed, his point I'm sure. In the middle, I was still disturbed. And then the end seemed trite. There was so much drama early on and so little to resolve it that is seemed over done. I agree with the other reviewers that it was his first book where I was bored."
1,The best day of my life - I finished this awful book.,"I'm not one to give up on a book I'm not enjoying - I try to barrel through. The fact that 'Until' bored me to tears for 800+ pages really says something about my tenacity as a reader. I kept thinking it had to improve...hope springing eternal and all of that. It never did. I love John Irving and was sorely, sorely disappointed by this huge waste of time."
1,NEVER should have been published,"Love John Irving; hated this book. If the author had not been JI, I believe this book would never have been published. The first 150+ pages are beyond boring. -- THEN, the 8-year-old begins having sex.There was not a single character that elicited any feeling other than boredom. A child was repeatedly molested and several main characters died, but they were such empty shells that there was no emotional impact.-- A horrible waste of time."
2,"Another story, please","It took me a year to read this. First time a John Irving book bored me. The constant sexual abuse in the beginning of the book is disturbing, then tedious. I only finished it to see if I actually could! I don't recommend this book at all. Go back to A Prayer for Owen Meany or Ciderhouse Rules if you want to read a GOOD John Irving book."
1,Boring--a terrible disappointment,"I own most of John Irving's novels, and have greatly enjoyed the majority of them. When I saw this novel at a church bazaar, for only $2.50, I was pleased to find such a bargain--now all the more so because it certainly isn't worth the cover price.Struggling around the halfway mark I am not enthusiastic about finishing this enormous tome. Simply put, it's terribly boring and redundant (frankly I'm tired reading about Emma holding Jack's penis), and none of the characters are very engaging, especially Jack. (BTW, I did NOT vote for George W. Bush and consider myself a liberal Christian.)This is not the John Irving of old ..."
2,Not so good,"I am a huge John Irving fan, but I really can't think of anything good to say about this story.Too much ink was devoted to young Jack, his penis and its appeal to older women. Although Irving is generally a master at introducing information that becomes important later in the story, I didn't find that to be the case with this book at all.Also, I think it is a story that took much too long to tell. Yet, it ended on a VERY weak note."
1,Disappointing,"I usually love John Irving books, but this one is a bummer. There is an interesting twist midway through the novel, but not worth the pain of reading it all. The characters are completely unsympathetic, the plot drags and the ending is abrupt, despite the length of the novel."
1,Didn't care,"After about 200 pages of slog, all I want is to give up. I'm bored, I don't care. And after hearing from others that the rest is just more of the same, you bet I will."
4,"maybe not the best, but still a great Irving novel","What makes John Irving my favorite author is how his characters embody the best and worst of humanity. They could truly be real people; some of them you wish you could meet, others you're glad are not alive (but you're aware there are people out there like them). ""Until I Find You"" exposes an issue (sexual abuse) that is very real and does happen to people, much like ""The Cider House Rules"" speaks of abortion. And while this is only a novel, and should be read that way, I do think that people need to be aware of the power our choices have on not only our own lives, but others as well. It is a long book, but just like the other John Irving novels I own and have read, I couldn't put it down until I finished it...even though there are sections I would rather roll my eyes at. I agree with another reviewer that this is probably not the novel to begin with. ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" might be a bette choice, a warm up, if you will."
5,Better Than Professionally Reviewed,"I had read a couple of reviews that sort of panned John Irving's latest book, one even citing that there was probably a good 300-page book in the 820 pages. Well, I will admit that one or two of his books have let me down, but certainly not this one.I read this while on vacation and I was disappointed that it ended so soon! Yes, the book is heavy but so what, when you get engrossed in the writing.So if you have liked other John Irving books, don't be put off by the ""professional"" reviewers' comments.Ray Johnson"
1,Bad Writing,"Succinctly put, this book is a flight of ideas about penises and fathers. Bloated and boring, this is an 800+ page example of how not to write a novel."
2,Not My Favorite,"I love John Irving's novels (it's hard not to isn't it) but I have to say that this is one of his worst. It doesn't seem to have the imagination, or spark, of his previous works. He is one of our greatest novelists but cannot be expected to turn out genius every time. If you haven't read much of him try earlier works first."
1,Boring!,"I've been a fan of John Irving since ""Garp."" ""Until I Find You"" was a great disappointment. When I ordered it from the local library, I was told I was well down on the waiting the list. It became available much sooner than expected. After reading 100+ pages of boring, humorless, heavy writing, I can understand why. I gave up (I assume others before me did, too) and returned it to the library two weeks before the due date."
2,Dear John,"Dear John Irving,Please get a better editor, someone who will be honest with you about what you have written. I'm begging you."
2,"Incredible author, maybe not so much this time","Please do not be put off from reading other John Irving novels because of the negative reviews, including mine, of ""Until I Find You."" Absolutely check out ""The World According to Garp, ""A Prayer For Owen Meany, or ""Cider House Rules."" Irving is masterful at creating unique, quirky, endearing characters. But not in this one. Any likable character in this novel is miniscule and rare. In addition, I am still pondering Irving's eerily light treatment of the overwhelming amount of child abuse his main character Jack has to sustain. Sexual abuse is dished out by practically every girl or woman Jack encounters. This makes for a depressing book that also seemed to go on far too long. That said, I strongly recommend this author as one of the best at walking the thin line between comedy and tragedy."
2,I'm sorry I read this novel,"Irving has lost his mind! This was sad to read as it just dragged on forever with no reward in sight. The taboo subjects were a little creepy but its main problem was that he wasted these developed characters on a dull, repetitive story. I think he is (was?) one of the greatest American writers alive. He must have a comeback novel next time out. If not, I think someone should check in on him."
2,From Owen Meany to Jack Burns,"Jack Burns is a taciturn one-dimensional character who can't say no. Not to his mother, his roommate, his dates, his teachers, nor any authority figure. We're supposed to think he had a hard life, but really he made his own hell.This book is one of John Irving's failures. I am glad I read it but will not give it to any friends unless they ask specifically for it."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't get through the entire book, I quit at page 605 after finally realizing I wasn't enjoying it at all, it was tedious and bland and what's with all the European street names that I couldn't pronounce, who cares??? UGH, it really kills me to write a bad Irving review, as I've read all the others and considered myself a huge fan. As the saying goes, ""can't be on top of your game forever"". Guess that applies here. Sorry John, you're capable of much better, or at least you were."
4,Invokes emotion,"When I heard this novel was over 800 pages I was ecstatic! When I read most of Irving's stories, I want them to go on and on and never end. This story did it's job - I snickered, I was anxious, I was heart-broken for these characters. It's a truely beautiful piece of work."
1,"As someone else wrote: Boring, but I would also add......","Tedious. I'm afraid that I can't see anything to like. Rather than continuing with the punishment I put it down tonight after 580 pages.I'm somewhat of a fan, I think that 'Owen' and 'Ciderhouse' are excellent."
2,Disappointing For Any Irving Fan,"I've read everything John Irving's published, and this is clearly his weakest effort. One tires pretty quickly of hundreds of pages of penis-holding! The book is populated by the most self-involved, unlikable, tedious characters he's ever created; it just plain gets hard to care that much about them. I like Irving's quirks- I really do- but nothing rings true here, and the few attempts at humor fall flat. This was a waste of my time and his talent."
1,I Just Couldn't Persist,"As you can tell from the reviews, you will either love or hate John Irving's latest novel, ""Until I Met You"". I tried and tried...and even though I got pretty disgusted reading about the main chacter, ""Jack's Little Guy"" (his penis), I tried to finish it. But alas, I got as far as page 500 (over half-way!) and just decided that LIFE IS TOO SHORT to keep reading bad fiction.I noticed that Amazon is offering a deal on this novel together with Nick Hornby's ""A Long Way Down""...just get that one."
4,"""Until I Find You""","This is the first John Irving book I've ever read and needless to say, I was captivated. This HUGE book, which I've lugged around for nearly a month, held my interest and continued to make me laugh, smile and sigh. I do think that this is a book for avid readers, not for someone that's looking to just pick up a book for a flight, or a weekend (partly because of the length). I gave this book 4 stars and not 5 because at times I felt lost, there are areas of the book that you should pay more attention to and unfortunately, you don't realize that until after you've passed them. Overall, this is a wonderful book!"
4,Organs and Tattoos,"I have long suspected the subject matter of this book (my third favorite of them all) was given to John late in the evening, in a small bar, as a challenge.""So if you're such a great writer, you could write about anything, huh? Write me a book about,....Tattoos and Pipe Organs!"
4,What a way to end a book,"I found the book to be odd, amusing, and sad in classic Irving fashion. I really liked this book. I didn't love it the way I did ""A Widow for One Year"" or ""A Prayer for Owen Meany,"" but I was compelled throughout the book to its finish. The final act of the book is so lovely. Maybe I was so moved because I had read of John Irving's plight with his own father, but this ending literally left me in tears and has stuck with me in the months since I read it. Maybe not the best Irving book to start with, but I think this book nicely compliments his collection."
1,Mr. Irving has outdone himself,"Just when you thought it was safe to read Irving again...after all, it couldn't possibly get any worse than The Fouth Hand, could it? Yes, it could, and it has. The so-called plot of this coffee-table-sized book revolves around the life of a young man and his ""best friend"", who started out as his first molester. And his nightmare tattoo-artist/prostitute mother, who chases the boy's father for years, only to embrace lesbianism at long last.I kid you not. Reading this book is like wading through quicksand."
3,Until I Find You,"John Irving has a fabulous imagination and the ability to put words together that really makes you feel 'in the moment'. I have read many of his novels, and have recommended this as a 'must read' to many of my friends who enjoy reading as much as i do."
3,Still Love John,"I love John Irving and most of his work. I love that the familiar often shows up in a book - wrestling, of course, little boy lost but up for the game - and always looking for the last puzzle piece that will make a ragged life complete. Still, I didn't love this book. I found myself putting it down rather than staying up all night to read it. I loved the vivid world of the tattoo artists. I even thought about getting a tattoo myself! The child molestation scenes were scary and repetitive, and I wondered why Jack (as the boy and the man) just didn't say ""leave me alone you pervert"" to the totally screwed-up Emma. Jack didn't seem to experience pleasure or fear from these assaults from Emma; rather a mixture of detachment and awe at the functioning of his emerging penis. As to Jack's absent father, what kind of man would agree never to have contact with his son again? I got to the point where I didn't care for the main characters and started getting really annoyed by Jack."
3,Until i find you,"John Irvings Until i find you is an interesting book at best a very long book most would say it has good charevter devolpment although the charecters are somewhat strange the storyline is somewhat out there though with a mother who is a tatto artist and a fater who is an organist who they spend 800 pages looking for and the child who we follow through his life who is a wrestler a actor and a screenwritter not to metion he is molested by older girls much of his younger years , the book has a few to many smaller charecters if i do say so my self ,but the main charecters devolp well though, but its a tad to long for me not exactly something i would rush to the book store to buy unless i was a fan of the author of course but it would be good to pick up second hand or on sale"
1,This is child molestation pornography in graphic detail,"This is a book that only a pedophile would want to read. It is blatent and unappoligetically child pornography. It contains graphic details about the molestation of a 4 year year old boy through his adulthood. This book does not have artistic integrity. It really is just pornography for the sick, sick, sick. When it refers to this repeated molestation by all sorts of women as abuse Irving puts the word abuse in quotations - ""abuse."" This implies that it is really not abuse, when in fact any sexual contact with four year olds should unequivically be considered molestation and violation and rape of a child. John Irving should have more social responsibility than to put this kind of sewage out there.I will not finish it. Though, I will try to read future novels as I have long been an avid fan of Iring's work."
5,I love to love a book,"I am so happy with this book. The last Irving novel I read was not so great, the one with the anchorman who loses his hand. That one made me think, oh no, he is slipping, but this new one saves the day. I love the characters, the perspective on sex and molestation, the humor. And best of all, it makes me want to write. The Amsterdam scenes remind me of the parts I liked from 'Widow for One Year'and the exploration of tattooing was incredibly engaging."
1,Child Molestation???,"I've been a huge fan of JI since the beginning of his careeer; however, I've read through 300 pages of his lastest novel and am appalled to find it contains nothing but episodes of child molestation.Jack Burns is molested by older girls and women from the age of 4 and is raped by a babysitter at the age of 10. I don't care if these ""experiences"" help shape his character in later years. They are disturbing and not at all entertaining.Why hasn't anyone mentioned this??? Maybe if the main character were a girl and she were being molested there would be an outcry...but since it's a boy, I guess people think it's acceptable.I'm throwing the book in the trash."
1,Very disappointing,I ordered this book before publication because I am such a fan. What a disappointment. I have struggled through 400 pages and that is the end. It is a truly BORING book. There is almost none of the humor and insight one expects in an Irving book. I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,The Novel That Wouldn't End,"I am a huge Irving fan and truly enjoy his ""out there"" approach to the stories he writes. In this novel I kept waiting for something interesting to happen among the boring and mundane details that make up so many of this books 1,000+ pages. Even when I didn't think I could hang with it another minute I pushed on because I was certain that at the end it would all be worth it. It wasn't. What a disappointment."
1,If You Are Considering This Book -- DON'T!,"Please believe the editorial reviews of Irving's latest on this site -- ""Self-Indulgent""; ""Decent Into Soft Porn""; ""Cry for Help"". It's not even that good.Like many of the customer reviewers I have to include the caveat that I really like John Irving. 'A Prayer For Owen Meany' will always be one of my personal favorites. I am even one of the handful of people who actually enjoyed 'The Fourth Hand'. That's why I rushed out and bought the hardcover - oh, what a mistake.I will feel that my time slogging through 'Until I Find You' was not completely in vain if I convince at least one person to save their money and their time."
4,Don't use the pillow case!,"I have high hopes for this pillow. I had 3/4 of my back fused and have degeneration above and below my fusion, and muscle spasam and neck pain. After several months of not being able to find a pillow that felt right, I decided to try one of these.I had slept on this pillow two nights with the pillow inside the provided case. It made the pillow stay very firm, and my neck felt pretty good, but I made the mistake of sleeping on my side for a nap and woke up with absolutely horrible pain from the pillow causing pressure on my jaw which flared up my TMJ problems.I read some reviews and tried the pillow without its case, just in a normal pillowcase for a nap this afternoon and it was much better. I think I like this one."
1,Hard as a rock!!,If you like sleeping on a rock then this is the pillow for you! I would never be able to fall asleep on this thing.
1,Disappointed,The pillow is really good but not functional with the tight pillow-slip which prevents the head from gaining the benefit from the pillow. In other words the extremely tight pillow slip hampers contact with the surface pillow. A loose fitting pillow slip will enhance the function of the pillow.The pillow slip is poorly made with a tough zip.
2,Maybe for really big people,I tried this pillow and figured it was for a bigger person. Too big for me. My husband didn't like it. My sister didn't like it. My son's caregiver didn't like it. My brother didn't like it. Now I have it back. This pillow seems like it should be comfortable but it's not. I think it's for a giant person. Your head is just too far off the bed.
3,Firm = HARD,"I prefer firm pillows so I thought this would be a good choice. This goes beyond firm to just plain hard. I took off the cover and that improved it slightly, but still to hard for me. Have actually found it to be a better lumbar support when sitting on a couch that is a bit too deep for me."
2,Not as good as it could be,"I wanted to like this pillow so much but it is hard as a rock, even without using the included pillowcase. Disappointing."
2,Sleeping on a log,"Nice design, but it does not contour the shape of the head and neck, it feels like sleeping on the wooden log with a few towels on it. This is just my experience with the product."
1,Don't bother buying this pillow!,"This pillow is too hard and really not usable, unless you want a stiff neck when you wake up. Not sure what to do with it."
2,another pillow that doesn't work,Received pillow in excellent condition. I have tried to use and adjust to pillow 5-6 times without success and so has my wife. Pillow is hard with or with out cover and cannot lay on it for more than a few minutes. It is now in the pile with the other tried but don't work pillows.
1,This pillow was not an ideal solution.,"Thought this pillow would be great, but I was frustratingly wrong. Even without the pillow case (which the manual says not to do), the pillow maintained a stench and was unnecessarily firm, causing neck tension and migraines to worsen, instead of get better. Don't buy it."
1,Too big,I did not like the pillow. It propped my head up way too high and I normally like extra firm pillows! Way too uncomfortable. It is also noisy when you move and the beads crunch together.
2,Not for homes with cats!,"I recently purchased thePike Street microbead pillow and promptly put it on my bed and felt like I was sleping on a cloud(for the first 2 nights)On the third night I kept feeling like someone had been eating cookies in bed. After scolding my husband and washing all the bed linens again, I settled in for a good nights sleep. WRONG!!! I got up and found myself covered in microbeads. They were all over the bed, me and the floor. After moving the pillow off of the bed, I noticed puffs of microbeads coming out of several microscopic holes in the pillow. It appeares that my cat has a great fondness for the feel of microbeads and his claws went right thruoght the cover. The pillow is now unable to be used. .WARNING TO CAT OWNERS."
2,Disappointing,"I have another microbead pillow that I was looking to replace and decided on this one. As many suggested, I slept on it without the provided cover to prevent restriction of bead movement, but to no avail. It was still far too hard, too high and too over-filled for a petite person such as myself. My neck, shoulders and back seized up within 5-10 minutes of lying down.I put the cover on it, and my cat is now enjoying it immensely as his new bed, hence 2 stars instead of just one."
