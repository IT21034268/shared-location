1,LEAKS! Cold. Not Deep.,"This is a real disappointment.It leaks. It's never been above the top line and even when it's at the bottom line it leaks -- so it's not overflowing the container. I've made sure that the container's properly sealed and have opened and closed it several times to see if I can make a difference. I'm not sure where it's coming from, but it leaks every time that it drains. I have to keep it in an old broiling pan or it'll make a mess every time.It's not a ""deep"" fryer. It has lots of oil, but the basket sits in the very top leaving quite a bit of oil below it. It's ok for french fries or things that don't require much depth, but you'll have to flip your chicken pieces as if you were pan-frying and it doesn't hold much.It's about 40 degrees cold. I've tested it with a digital candy thermometer. Even if I set it at it's max temperature, I have to add time to all of the cooking instructions to get the food cooked properly."
1,"Total rubbish, what a mess!","as with most of the other 1 star reviews I had the same issue. First use it fried fine then when it came time to drain it, half went the reservoir, the rest went all over the counter. STAY AWAY!"
1,Garbage,"This is my first and only review. I used to have the Hamilton Beach fryer on here, but it got left in the rain(idiot move). It did an excellent job, but messy to clean(plus half the price). I thought I would upgrade. Bad Idea. Put the oil in and let it preheat to the 374. The Preheat light went off. I dropped a test piece into the oil. Went straight to the bottom and barely bubbled. I let it heat more. No better. Never got to temperature. Ruined half the dinner with greasy balls of fish. Had to go to a pot of oil and finished dinner. I am returning asap. Stick the Hamilton Beach. Has a charcoal filter you will probably like better.Hamilton Beach 3 Liter Deep Fryer Digital Timer"
3,Made in China,"Just so you know before you purchase this fryer, it is made in China. It does look nice though. I read other reviews about the plug falling out and it does a lot, it is hard to keep the plug in. You can't leave the handle on the basket unless you want it sticking out on the counter all the time. You can't tell when the oil has reached the desired temperature. I came close to returning it but decided to give it a chance. I liked my other tfal fryer better but it was 20 years old. After a couple of months now I decided I really like this fryer. Especially when it comes to cleaning. You just have to remember to clean the oil when it is cool, don't try and clean it after you have just used it. It is so easy to clean, nothing at all like my old fryer. I can change the oil as often as I want now, it is so easy."
3,Great small fryer,"I have mixed feelings about this fryer. On the one hand, I love the way the oil drains into its own container. It's filtered and ready to go the next time. Clean-up is relatively easy. So what's the issue? The fry basket is actually pretty small. the issue is the depth, it's only 4 inches at best. That means lots of small batches (which is better for maintaining oil temperature, so it is a tradeoff.) I selected this primarily for clean-up, and in that area I would rate it 5 stars. Just depends on what you plan to cook."
3,Nice fryer but a problem,"I got this for Christmas 2006 and I've used it 4 times (it's now February.) The last time I used it, got the oil hot and it started leaking out all over the counter. I pulled the plastic oil container out so as to not melt it and replaced it with a bowl. Couldn't do much else until the oil cooled down. The next morning I cleaned up the huge mess and washed out the metal fry basin. Filled it up with water and it was leaking like crazy around the filter. It's held in place by a cheap compression type ring. I emailed customer service last week and have had no reply."
4,It works as expected but...,"I read all of the reviews before I bought this. I saw the warnings about overflows and placed it in a huge pan just in case.Yes, it did overflow once even though I made sure the oil level was below max.Yes, it was a mess.No, it has not happened again since. If you leave the plug out of the oil holder when you pour the oil back in it will not overflow when it drains. Think of it as a burp. the air has to go somewhere and holding it in is detrimental. You know what I mean.Not only would I recommend this, I would even buy it for a friend. The temperature is near constant, it is consistent, and it really does clean easily. The heating light is easily read if the machine sits horizontally on the counter and the air filters sufficiently prevent odors.Overall it is the best frier I ever owned. Money well spent and it performs beautifully."
5,Best I've ever used,"I've had this fryer a while. I love it because it's so easy to strain the oil after you've used it. The worst thing about other fryers was dealing with the oil after you've used it. It has a temperature gauge, and is easy to use."
5,Memories!,"My grandma was German and loved Roger Whittaker's voice. The moment I heard his voice, I was transported back to when I lived with my grandma and her singing Stille Nacht. He has that one-of-a-kind mellow voice that makes anything he sings sound wonderful!"
1,Arrived damaged and not working,"I ordered this for an impaired friend who was willing to pay a little extra for quality. The item arrived with insufficient packaging, loose internal speaker, broken internal wiring, missing decals and signs of previous repair work. This is unacceptable for $110 payment. The manufacturer's 800 number does not work and they have not returned my call to their regular toll call numbers."
4,Crazy Mary,"This is a great book.It is impossible to put down once you've started reading it. The author writes very well,and the theme is captivating.If you like books about real life, read this one!Sophia Casas"
4,"Very good, but a bit skinny on Zoroastrianim per se","I purchased the book with the anticipation that I would learn more about Zoroastrianism and its practice. Instead, I found an engaging and well written book that disucsses the legacy of that ancient religion on Judiaism, Christianity and Islam. I also discovered quite a bit about pre-Islamic Persia.Kriwaczek does a masterful job of detalining the shadows of Zarathustra's teachings in the present, and the tremendous debt world civilization owes to Zoroastrianism as a belief system: for example, the concept of ""good"" vs. ""evil"" in a cosmic battle for universal supremacy; or the idea of a paradise in the ""hereafter""; even angels and demons are remnants of the old Persian religion. Its simply a wonderful read, and gives one a deeper understanding of the Near East in general and Iran specifically."
3,Hope you like to IRON! Ick!,"First off I was suspicious at the retail price of $150 for a set of pillowcases that had been marked down to $8.99 at a savings of 94%. That should have been my first clue that something was drastically wrong. Well, the pillowcases arrived today and I washed them. They came out of the washer looking fine and smelling good after a good dose of Downy fabric softener. They came out of the dryer looking all wrinkled and especially the edges were all bundled up like last night's night shirt. I use lots of pillows so I put four pair on the bed the way they came out of the dryer. If you wanted them for a guest bedroom, you would have to iron them and especially the hems. I will say they are very soft and for the price, I guess they are fine. Someone would have to be out of their ever loving mind to pay $150 a pair for these."
5,Perfect for a man,"I bought this for my husband for our 42nd Anniversary. He wears a dog tag for the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and I thought what a great anniversary gift to wear with his dog tag. A symbol of how our marriage is united with and blessed by God. He loves it and wears it every day. It's just the right size for him, not too small and not too large. It's not shiny, more of a matte type finish and it doesn't look thin or cheap like some sterling silver. It's a perfect piece of jewelry for a man who really doesn't like jewelry (like my husband)."
3,"Some great cuts, and some trash","The album is a good deal if you are looking for the rare surf instrumentals it contains, like Mr. Moto and Mr. Rebel. Most of the re-recorded songs (particularly the Jan & Dean stuff) sounds terrible. But with 32 songs on the CD, I found enough great original surf classics to still be glad I bought it."
3,Most songs are the original versions but BEWARE!,"Kahuna Classics seems like a great collection of surf hits. Except for one thing--some of the recordings are the dreaded ""NEW STEREO RECORDINGS."" I feel this is somewhat deceptive but at least at the store you can read it before you buy it. If you order this CD you won't know till it arrives. The only other negative comment is that the Beach Boy cuts are from their first recording sessions. Not their best work. Fortunately, Miserlou and many of the other selections are the same great tunes we know and love. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because only a few of the tunes are NEW. But listening to Papa Oom Mow Mow redone was almost PAINFUL! Surfin' Bird Forever!!"
5,Great product.,"This was perfect for what I wanted. People need to understand that this is JUST CABLE. The connectors are not included. Customers should only buy this if they know that upfront.Also note that this is ""stranded"" cable not solid.Stranded type cable typically is used for short application where there are alot of twists or turns."
1,"Patch Cable - Super Long, but did not come with the clamps","Based on the picture, I thought that this super long cord would have come with the ends that go from one device to the other. It did not. So I now have all of this wire when I should have just gone to Wal-Mart and purchased a 50Ft patch cord with the ends in tact. I did go to Wal-Mart and I'm satisfied. I'm hoping that some network person will express an interest in the useless cable that I now posess."
1,difficult to see,I bought this to monitor my babysitter and the picture was very grainy and difficult to see. I didn't use it and would not recommend it for this use.
1,Not what it appears to be,"It says one star, but I really give this album about a thousand negative stars.Jeez, I really hate when bands/record companies do this. Rerecord their old hits and put it out to unsuspecting buyers as a greatest hits collection. I blame the record companies even more than the artists -- since NOWHERE on the packaging does it say what this REALLY is. These companies ought to be sued for fraudulent marketing.Go get another Searchers album instead."
2,"Half originals/half remakes. ""Needles & Pins"" no guitars.","Greatest Hits by the Searchers is misleading. Actually it is part original 60's recordings and part remakes with electric piano and hardly any guitar. I was hoping to hear the original versions from the 60's. The one's they played on the radio, not some remakes without the harmony vocals and 12 string electric guitars. Disappointing."
5,Hooray for Edith Ann!,"I adore this book! Edith Ann is so insightful, funny and charming. This book will truly brighten up your day and make you laugh. An absolute MUST for Lily Tomlin fans!!!"
1,What a joke!,"This is a terrible non-functioning case. Do not waste your time or money on this product. You need something that is more of a pouch with a slide phone. I would have sent this back, if it was worth the effort. The Samsung slide phones just do not work well with these cases."
1,"A biography, not a resource book","I found this book to be a touching tribute from a father to his son. I did not find it helpful for children. Children were drawn in to the story (I used it in the classroom) but couldn't identify with the issues of other autistic children. I, too, think that stories about nonverbal autistic children with motor stims is very limiting. Finally, I must say that the author is obviously very self-important, which I found to be a turn-off."
3,INDIVIDUAL PORTRAIT OF AUTISM,"The author has three children, one of whom has autism. He does a good job in capturing Russell's expressions as he navigates socially within his family. The other children provide their insights on their brother's behavior.Autism is not clear cut nor is it black and white as the photographs in this book. It is a neurosensory condition replete with behaviors that appear to have a sensory basis, e.g. aversion for loud noises and certain smells.I felt the effort was good and the intentions were good, but I was disappointed in the book. I felt it emphasized Russell's seeming isolation and did not explain that this was an individual account and not a general overview of autism. Although the photographs would most likely make that point, I felt the book didn't quite get that across as the writing appeared to generalize autism when it is a spectrum condition that is as varied as the number of individuals who have it."
4,Sensitive photographs of a family affected by autism.,"This book describes Russell, a boy affected by autism. It uses Russell's particular story as a jumping off point to describe some other aspects of autism. This is not a book about mild autism. It shows the difficulties and the rewards of dealing with a child who has significant challenges.I liked the fact that this book is illustrated with photographs of a real child and his family. The illustrations clearly convey the caring bond between Russell, his parents and his siblings. Sometimes photographs can be more evocative than even the most sensitive drawings.Carol E. Watkins, M.D."
2,Broke my heart!,"As the parent of a child with autism, I was very excited by the possibilies this book offered. There is limited availability of books for children on autism. I was saddened though as a I read this book and looked into Russell's eyes. The pictures made him seem so isolated from his family and the world. All children have gifts and this book did not share Russells' gifts. It did not make me want to know Russell only feel sorry for him. My son's brother did not want this book read to his classmates as it would make them feel sorry for his brother."
2,So many better books on autism out there,"This is one of my least favorite children's books on autism. It examines one autistic boy from his family's perspective, not his own. The pictures are black and white and very grim. While it might be useful for children who have a sibling with autism, it does little to give encouragment to the family or explain to that sibling how he can still have a brother who loves him very much. Granted, it looks at the life of a severely autistic child, not one with PDD-NOS, AS, or HFA. But it just felt so fatalistic to me-cold and clinical. Not recommended for classroom reading or reading to children, especially not for inclusion teachers. Many better autism books out there."
5,Hilarity and Insanity- in a box!,"One of the craziest, most manic anime series I've seen, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu (Hare + Guu) is a unique brand of comedy. Much of the humor revolves around Hare, our overly stressed, 40 year old persona in a child's body, who finds himself the sole witness of the craziness that surrounds Guu. While mostly episodic, the show does reach a satisfying, surprisingly emotional conclusion regarding the background of Hare's mother, Weda.Hare + Guu's frantic pacing and off the wall humor may not be for all audiences, but for those who can tolerate a high energy torrent of psychedelic craziness, the show delivers very well. Fans should also consider buying the Hare + Guu Deluxe OVA, and Hare + Guu Final OVA (when released), which provide additional closure beyond the initial storyline.Rating wise, Hare + Guu is roughly PG-13 due to violence and adult humor."
4,good product,"I ordered this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!It requires some adult help to get going, but was well worth the money."
3,Fast fizzle,"My daughter played it for a week straight, and it has since sat unattended. Not sure if she just solved the cases quickly and bored of it or not, but it didn't seem long that she had been through them. She is very interested in this kind of thing and said she liked it, but it fizzled out fast from its initial opening......"
2,did not come with all of the items,"This product did not meet expectations. I'm an 11 year old boy and this so called ""toy"" is the worst toy I've ever gotten. For not including all of the parts and the liquids were not in their containers. In fact they weren't there at all. warning to all DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
3,Mostly entertaining with exceptions,"I have the 2003 daily calendar. Less than half of this year's entries are survival-related; actually many of them are on environmental topics. I would mildly recommend the 2004 version, except that ""Today's Hero"" for 9/1/03 was Col. Muammar Qaddafi of Libya. (Anyone remember Pan Am 103?) It said his junta seized power in a ""nearly bloodless coup"", meaning bloody coup. I received no response to my email to the publisher inquiring what possessed them to call a terrorist a hero. I guess their irony was lost on me."
1,A Bigtime Ripoff,"""How to Control a Runaway Camel""......""How to Escape a Runaway Parade Balloon""......""How to extinguish a Christmas Tree Fire""....give me a break.The ""Inspirational Heroes"" pages are also complete jokes with obvious political messages trumping actual survival stories.You would do well to investigate ""Joshua Piven"" and ""David Borgenicht"" on google to find out what their intent was in writing this piece of garbage."
4,Useful,The book is useful. The worksheets downloaded from the Internet are also very clear.Sometimes you expect more explanations on statements which use new features not connected with the subject being reviewed.I think that I shall not need to purchase any other book on this subject.
5,Great book!,Great book to work with VBA and macros. This book gives a good background of the concepts and many examples. Thanks a lot!!
1,Disappointing,I have muscle damage in my leg and use rubs to relieve some of the discomfort from it. This stuff is useless! Ben-Gay or even dollar store ointments work better. I definitely do NOT recommend this cream.
4,"Good, Considering.","Writing a bio about one of the most secretive artists in history must have been rough and Kort does an admirable job here. Even if she'd wanted to put together a real tell all expose, do you really think that anyone in Nyro's circle would have talked? I'm also sure that the author originally left much more juicy stuff in but that other individuals had the upper hand. Let's not complain. We may never see another Nyro book."
2,Overwhelmed by details,"Page after page of minutia. Might please extreme Laura Nyro fans, but I couldn't get past page 65. It's clear the author has done extensive of research. She's just not a good storyteller. I've been listening to Laura Nyro since the late 60s. Her music remains her story."
5,An ace job.,"Considering the lengths Laura Nyro went to to keep her private life out of the public eye, it's amazing that we have this book at all, let alone that it's as well put-together as it is. Michele Kort does a first-rate job in showing the evolution of Nyro, her music and her outlook on life, which was always key to how her muse took hold. What you end up with is a portrait of a woman steadfastly true to herself, no matter the cost to her career. I'm left with admiration for her, admittedly tempered by a feeling that not every choice she made was a good one. No matter; this is a well-drawn biography of an interesting and uniquely talented person who made some unforgettable music."
1,"Men listened to her music, too!","Starting the comments with that Library Journal review is misleading and I'm glad to see that most of the customer reviews are from men. I haven't read the book yet but just wanted to say thanks to those real 70's men who locked themselves in their rooms with Laura's music, too!"
4,A Stylish Backpack for Women,Very nice stylish backpack for women. It can hold more than look like it can. I only wish there was an outside pocket to store items like a boarding pass or phone besides the zip on on the side. The zip on the side is not designed for that.
2,"Small, but nice","Too small for my needs, but very nice looking. Very stiff, doesn't expand very easily. But it has a lot of compartments."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"When I purchased this backpack for my laptop, I was unsure whether it would accommodate my lap top. The dimensions on the page said that it would fit up to a 15"" screen lap top. Well I have Dell Inspiron with a 17"" screen, and it fits. It is snug, but it works. It has three separate compartments; for your laptop, files and miscellaneous items, and all of you adaptors and things that you use along with your computer. There is also a make-up bag attached also. The bag appears to be sewn together well. The straps are comfortable and the pink and black is so cute. Overall, I have no complaints. I love it."
2,Too large!!,I like the look of this but it was huge!! I showed it to my friend and she thought it was a backpack with wheels. The design is very attractive but too big. I had to return it.
3,Not sure what to make of this one,"I wasn't sure what to make of this CD when I ran across it in a cutout bin, but I took a chance based on the year (1991) and label (Roadrunner), figuring there was a good chance it was a metal album of some sort. It turns out Venus Beads were a short-lived UK-based indie rock band.1991's Black Aspirin is the band's second (and final) album. Honestly, I'm not sure what to make of it. It probably qualifies as ""alternative,"" but not in a grunge kind of way. Shoegaze, maybe? Some of the songs rock out a bit, but in a fuzzy guitar tone, angsty kind of way. It's not bad for what it is, I suppose, but this is definitely not my kind of music. I could definitely see Venus Beads appealing to fans of edgy, intellectual pop/rock and alternative music."
4,No more squeaks,"It took a little practice to get the best results, but you'll never find the screw holes after a little dab from a stain stick."
4,Wonderful,"It came within the predicted time, within the last few days of the delivery window. I was able to easily install the product without much trouble and I have seen some improvement in the performance of my computer.It totally could have been packaged better and have come with a bit more instruction that it did. It arrived in a cardboard box with one layer of bubble wrap around the body of the plastic packaging, decent at best. Perhaps it should have warned the use about the dangers of static electricity on the product but luckily for me I was well grounded and it was raining the few hours before my installation. But the review is about the product so that's why it didn't get a 3 star or less rating. I haven't had the product for a duration long enough to be fully satisfied so until then it shall remain at 4 stars.Quality product for a wonderful price with decent packaging and delivery. If it happens to die on me within the next year, then I sure will have something to say about it. :]"
5,Crucial DDR PC 3200 memory,received this memory in three days with free shipping. Maxed out my older system with four gigs. I've used Crucial memory for years and have never had a problem.Great price and service
5,Memory update,"Sort of like getting new tires, would rather not have to deal with it but it's to keep things rolling. Am back on the road. Thanks Crucial."
5,Crucial 2 GB Memory,With the help from Crucial.com I identified these to be compatible to my PC. Bought it from Amazon. Worked perfectly right of the bat. My PC is now much faster.
5,Excellent Memory,The product arrived quickly. It installed easily. The extra memory caused our older PC to run like new again.
1,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this upgrade kit to expand the memory of my computer. It worked great for about fifteen minutes then everything went black. So it was off to the repair shop, where I was informed the one of these modules was bad and had also burned out a memory slot. Anyone can get a defective item from time to time. This was just really an inconvenient time to have my system down. Not to mention the expense."
1,Not what I bargained for!,"I ordered this to upgrade my computer in November. Upon installation, I suddenly started getting a ""Blue Screen"" with some sort of error message. After a bunch of swapping new and old modules, I suspected that one module was dead on arrival. Took it to a friend who is a certified Tech. He confirmed my belief and swapped out the faulty module with a good one he had on hand. I expected more quality from Crucial!"
5,Yes! More Memory!,So glad the sales associate showed me a site to find out about obtaining more RAM for my computer! It's running so much faster now! Yeah!
2,Performance,"I had ordered two identical memory boards (Crucial 1 Gb each) for my computer to add to the existing two 256 Mb memory boards. However, during startup my computer tells me that these two 1Gb boards are not compatible. One may be defective. At this point I do not know if the computer is using them. I checked the website for a Crucial contact phone number, but was unable to find one.I don't know how this problem can be resolved since I don't know who to contact."
2,Crucial 2 GB kit,I had to returned this product as it was impossible to sit the card on the connector(in the process I ruined the anchors)of my Asus mother board. Never had any problems with Corsair memories.
3,"Nice, but could have been better.","I noticed a fairly decent increase in gaming performance when I upgraded from 1gb to 3gb of ram. As far as normal day to day use (like MS Office, e-mail, and surfing the web) I saw little to no gains in performance. I can have a few apps open, and it's as if I was still running on 1gb of ram.So, I paid ~$50 for a boost to gaming. It's nice that my games run better, but I expected more from the additional 2gb of ram (for a total of 3gb)."
2,Okay,I was about to give this game a 1 star due to frausration in the levels ' but i decided to let it slide ' now im a beginner to the starfox games and i saw starfox assault on the shelves so i picked it up today i played it and the levels and gameplay are confusing as hell you ll here a character call out for help but you ll half to shoot down the enemy who is after them but sometime the enemy is invisible from the attack making it impossible to hit even the ground enemies are sometime invisible from getting hit ' maybe its because im a beginner but i doubt it ' and the levels are hard and difficult ' But if youre new to the starfox games get starfox adventures first because i think fox is not in no annoying wing
2,a huge disspointment,"for star fox fans, this is not your game. Star Fox on the N64 just had tank and flying and thats what we wanted. But when i got Star fox 64 i wanted foot missions, now that I got them, i have to face the fact that it sucks. The flying missions are great and fun and so are the tank missions. But then u go to a foot mission and the action is stopped by the controls of the onfoot missions. Its a good thing that there arent a lot of on foot missions. People dont buy this game. RENT IT! 100s of games to rent or buy just rent this"
2,Bad Game,"This game is only good for the space missions. On the ground the enemies get killed in two hits and some can only be killed if you fully charge your gun. The tank is hard to use and not all that great. Plus the amount of missions (ten) allows you to beat it in about 2 days. I would probably say only play this game if you are a big Star Fox fan. If not, then buy something else."
2,Bitter disappointment.,"What a let-down this game is. Seriously, is it too much to ask for a solid flying game like Star Fox 64 was? I mean getting out and walking around shooting things is great and all, but this is a STAR FOX game, and the last thing I would buy a Star Fox game for is to run around and blow things up, especially when there are other games out there that fulfill that type of game play so much better. I was expecting the bulk of this game to be spent flying around in an R-Wing....boy was I wrong.Do yourself a favor if you've never bought a Star Fox game before, go to a pawn shop, get a N64 and buy Star Fox 64. You'll thank me when it's over."
3,Nintendo we have a problem,"Why couldn't Starfox stay the way it was on the N64? The first level was fun, the Starfox team chases a crazy monkey to the planet of Fortuna. Then the crazy monkey turned his space ship into a giant mechanical version of himself, very amusing and charming. But after the first level Starfox transitions from the N64 style to a weird Xbox style shooter. He jumps out of his Arwing and is told to shoot targets. Then he gets a tank called a landmaster. The Landmaster was very clunky. Even if had Nintendo focused on Arwing levels, it still has issues with voices. In Star Fox 64 slippy screamed ""Fox! NOOOOO!"" if I died. In this game all I heard was was ""Fox. No."". Peppy didn't sound very peppy, he forgot to tell me to do a barrel roll. Pretty much all that the team did was ask for help in dull expressionless tones. If you do purchase a Star Fox game, get the original, the beta unreleased Star Fox 2 rom on PC, or Starfox 64. Do not get this unless you are really into shooters."
4,"Fun, but clunky controls","Star Fox Assault is a fun game, pretty darn good. I like it more than Star Fox Adventures, but not as much as Star Fox 64. The story is pretty good, but the voices are still annoying at times. I like the space levels and foot levels for the most part. The controls are clunky, though, making it somewhat difficult. The multiplayer is really fun. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,umm..well,"the game was missing a special quality that the 64 version offered and that was the alternate paths that could be taken.this game is mainly for those with friends :D cause the game rotates around mainly the multiplayer option.im a star fox fan but i would mostly recommend this game only if your mainly interested in the multiplayer mode not so much for the story mode since again,...too short :O.the characters and the voice acting seemed to my liking.the gameplay in story mode:the arwing levels were pretty fun but the arwing itself along with the pacing of the level seemed slow and the boost doesnt seem to make that much of a difference but other than that, it was fairly enjoyable. The land master levels werent too bad just that it took to long to complete the mission. The setting was too big and took fox way to long to get from point a to point b. Foxes flinching was a bit irritating (when he got hit).overall, the game was enjoyable :D"
4,Great edition to the Star Fox series,"Star Fox Assault is a great edition to the series. Not only can you fly in your Arwing, but you also must complete missions on foot with a huge arsenal of weapons, like your blaster, machine guns, and gattling guns. The multiplayer is also great with a lot of battle arenas. My only complaint is that the main game is way too short, with only 10 missions. But this is still a great game."
3,Not the original,"First of all, this game cannot be compared to the SNES or N64 games. Those games were amazing. So setting this game completely apart from the others, I enjoy it. I like the mixture of ground and air playing. It offers a bit more variety. I'll admit it's not the best game ever, but I still think it's worth playing, especially for a Star Fox ga."
2,Boy was this bad!!!!!!,"This game was one of the most anticipated titles for Gamecube since it was announced in 2003. But it was delayed. And Now that it's FINALLY out, it was definetely not worth the money. The graphics are really good, and the music is really entertaining, but besides that it's terrible. The story is one of the worst I've ever seen in a video game. The voice acting is monotonous and all sounds like the actors are reading straight off the script, and just saying the words. But the biggest problem is the terrible controls. The landmaster tank is impossible to drive, and Fox can't even turn around well. This game has some okay rail flying missions, but the areas you fly in are too small to move away from things you can fly into. I loved Star Fox 64 on the N64, and hated Star Fox Adventures. There have been no good Star Fox games since 1997. If this series wants to continue, there needs to be a good game. If there isn't, no more Star Fox games will be made."
2,very ok,"This game could have been so much better. The game was far to short, to much running instead of flying, and bad voice acting. The main reason I rented this game was to have that old star fox 64 feel. The times it did have that feel it didn't last near long enough. I would recomend this game to kids that like the series. But for adults, just stick to star fox 64."
4,A good return for the fox.,Good: Fun gameplay ; Great voice acting ; Ability to repeat your missions in different difficulties to beat your score ; Good variety of land and air missions ; Up to 4 players in a multiplay battles ; Unlockable goodies.Bad: A short game of only 10 missions ; multiplayer won't last that long.
5,¡Falco is back!,"Cool game this is the best game of star fox and you can use tanks,arwings and you can play in the earth star foxs rockss."
2,"Gamespot says ""A must play"" I say ""Piece of crap""","I would like you to know that gamespot didn't actually say that. And this is the first star fox game I have played. Now that that's straightened out, this game isn't very good. The only thing that saves it from 1 star is graphics and weapons. That is the only ""good"" thing in this hunk o' junk. The controls take too long to get used to, the missions were to weird(not ""unique"", weird), and the enemies leave nothing to the imagination. And the HUD is also weird. And if the next person who reveiws also includes a ""counter-review"" of mine, saying that I have to high standards or no taste, I'll say ""My standards arn't high and I have plenty of taste. This game just sucks!"""
4,Star Fox is it wroth it?,The star fox saga has always been a great joy since we frist laid eyes on him during the N64 days. But this new is great better then frist however the game is so short you could beat in One days time. The gharphics are great which is why i gave shuch a good score of 4 out of 5 stars. When it all comes down to is this game is more for rent then actully buying. But if your a fan of star fox pick it up other wise rent it.
3,Dissapointing - not worth 50 bucks,"Starfox adventures was about 10 times better than this game. I beat it in 3 days, and im not a very good gamer. The story was decent the game play was decent the dialogue was laughable. If you feel you really need to play this game i would rent it on gamefly, not worth 50 bucks. The big thing that ticked me off is how much worse this was than the previous game."
5,Beautiful/Functional,"This gate has it all..beauty, easy to step over, keep small dogs in place, and the small arched door to let the small dogs in and out is wonderful...no lifting them over. Love it and would buy another and highly recommend this gate."
2,Cute and Pretty just don't cut it for me.,"We purchased 4 of these gates from another seller - because we thought they were very pretty. After installing them we realized how tall they were! We kept them installed and carefully stepped over them but it wasn't a week and I fell over one...right on my backside!! That was it. They are pretty but not for short people. We went to target and got the automatic open gates and WE LOVE THEM!! Besides, what use are they if they are stationary, they only open for the pet and not the person, the person is still trapped! NOT Good for us maybe good for tall folks...I got 4 for sale cheap! ;)"
4,"For a bagged tea, very good","While I'm not generally a fan of bagged teas (vs. loose leaves), this black tea (with a *strongly* aromatic peach overtone) is very good. It has a clean, fresh taste (heavy-duty individual sealed wrappers help) and very little of the slight cardboard-y flavor that afflicts many bagged teas. It's also not extremely strong (a little milk goes a long way in this one), so it's drinkability is fairly all-purpose."
5,Always a favorite,This tea is great hot or iced. All of my guests rave about this tea and it is one of my favorites. The quality is high and it is full flavored with a hint of smokiness. A true winner!
4,Great coat,"I received a black one, and i love the way it feels. But It's perfect for california. its not as warm as I would like though. thats why I am giving it a four star."
5,Amazing historical reference and fun to read,"For anyone who wants to learn all there is to know about early Nevada, this is the book! It is interesting and easy to read and gives a great historical perspective of the early settlers and how the Utah Territory became Nevada. There is not a stone unturned."
5,A GOOD INTRODUCTION ON THE HISTORY AND STUDY OF THE QURAN,"As a person who converted to Islam and curious about how the Quran was revealed and compiled, this book answers a lot of questions. Despite the so called bad review from the person before me, this book is very accurate, non contradictory. Any educated Muslim or person interested in Islamic history knows this book is a fine work and a must for those who want to learn more about the Quran. It even presents arguments by the Orientalists (those who study islam who are not muslim) on the Quran."
2,Up-dated version needed--,Things have changed - even on islands--in past 19 yrs. A lot of the information is seriously out-dated.
5,Great Music,"I have I do not know how many albums of music, but this one has something not many others do and that is zest. When you listen to a song that has something of a mellow beat it calms you down but this album when you listen to one of its mellow songs, it is still upbeat and happy. I would recomend this album to anyone who wants to listen to music that is upbeat and fun."
5,3P - Pure Pop Perfection,"Amazing album - electro-poppy, glam-rocky, totally fabulous. Every song is a winner. Easily as good as anything Madonna/Kylie puts out. Sheer deliciousness."
5,A Pop Electronic Classic,"This CD is a masterpiece of synthesizers and melody. Tracks such as So Good, Crazy Boys and Some Girls are mesmerizing. The CD should have been a huge seller and hopefully it isn't too late for people to purchase it and enjoy it. Earlier in 2010 it was announced that Rachel Stevens was recording again. Hopefully she won't stray from the style of this CD using some of the same writers and producers. Treat yourself and buy this CD."
3,Pop & Dance Music At Its Best,"For people who have heard Jo O'Meara's album Relentless, Rachel CD's is almost the complete opposite. Most of the songs on Jo's CD are slow, deep, and emotional. Rachel's CD is more about having a good time, partying and the music on her CD is definitely more fast-paced than Jo's album. The music on Rachel's CD is generally fast, and has a lot of pop and techno grooves on it. This is definitely an album for anyone who appreciates pop/dance/club music at its best. In my opinion, the best songs on this CD are: Funny How, Nothing Good About This Goodbye, Some Girls."
5,Why is she not a huge star?,"This record flopped miserably in the UK and why that happened is a great mystery because it is one of the most perfect pop records since Kylie's ""Fever"" - one high after another. If you like Kylie, Annie, Robyn, Girls Aloud, Sugababes, Madonna, even Goldfrapp - all women who produce intelligent pop music - then you'll like Rachel Stevens. Stay away from her first album - just get this one. My fave tracks - the gorgeous ""I Will Be There,"" ""NOthing Good About This Goodbye,"" ""So Good"" and the masterful ""Some Girls."""
5,A Runaway's Circus Adventures,"Toby Tyler or Ten weeks with a Circus was written in the late 1800s but the story is just as charming now as it was then. The boy Toby runs away from his foster home to work at the circus. From the very beginning he has his doubts about his decision, but doesn't want to break his word to the candyman who has offered him a job. Toby soon finds out that living and working and traveling with the circus is very different from what he expected. He has to work hard, gets little sleep and little food, and feels homesick. What keeps him going are his friends - at first, an old monkey, then a living skeleton and a fat lady, and he wins more and more hearts as time passes. He even gets a chance at becoming a circus star - but he still just wants to go home. This is an abridged version (though not much shorter than the original). It's an easy read that should make good bedtime reading for kids."
3,"Great for chisels, not so good for plane irons","If you need sharp chisels in a hurry, this device is for you. Just remember to buy the assortment pack of sand paper disks because those provided don't cover the gamut and they go quickly.For plane irons, this tool has some uses - but not for the bigger Lie Nielsen plane irons. For the standard size irons, this gizmo does short work of lapping and gets you a fairly decent edge. But wider irons (and chisels) won't fit into the carriage. You can still do the lapping on this, which the more expensive Tormek sharpening system won't let you do at all. But for the final edge, You still need to resort to guides and stones or sandpaper on glass plates for larger irons.There's a market out there for the tool that will do it all. Wonder who will be the first there."
3,could be better but could not be perfect,"My wife got me this for Xmass and I've had a couple months using it. It's worth the price for chisels and plane irons, but I find that to get an edge to razor sharpness, I have to finish on an arkansas stone.The leather hone is a must-have. In fact, the leather hone is nearly the best part.The biggest shortcoming is that the motor speed can not be adjusted or reversed. Some tools just can't be sharpened with the wheel turning counter clockwise.I'm glad to have this in my arsenal and buy (or ask for) again."
5,Worksharp Rocks,This little machine let me sharpen all of my brand new chisels in one evening from the ground up. I loved the way it worked and it definitely alleviated the tediousness of the sharpening chore. Two Thumbs up from me.
4,Good tool for the same cost as good quality diamond honing plates,Puts a razor sharp edge on chisels and plane irons in just 2 or three minutes. Far faster then using water or diamond stones. Very satisified with this product.
5,Ribbons,"How I coveted my freind's Work Sharp and endured his torterous bragging, but no more. Finally got one and I could not be more pleased. My poor, embarassing chisels and lathe tools are like new again. After looking through the manual and watching the provided DVD, I was in operation. The edge vision wheel for curved tools works beautifully. My chisels have an edge they havent seen since they were new. My lathe tools actually cut verses grind wood into submission, leaving wonderful ribbons of wood shavings on the shop floor. Excellent product."
3,Hard to see number,-Hour hand hard to distinct during day time and at nite with its lite.-Small number for month and date together in small area.
5,Brilliant,"Spong is a refreshing voice in an otherwise mundane world of Christian thought dominated by mostly loud fundamentalists whose agenda is nothing short of mandating their own form a sharia law on the rest of Christianity. Spong pulls away the rose colored glasses and examines christianity's purpose in the modern world in an attempt to make it relevent and devoid of its tribalistic bronze age and medieval interpretations. I much admire Spong for his courage to question these primitive, though widely accepted, myths & legends that have comme to make up Christianity as most know it."
5,Amazingly good book,"I left the Christian Church when I was 12, over the specific issue of its hate-crimes against gay people. But I had a lot of trouble with other ""fairy-tale"" aspects of the faith as well. How does a benevolent God create hell? If God exists, why doesn't he speak?This is the ONLY book I have ever read by a Christian where I found myself saying YES, YES, YES on every page. Spong addresses all the problems (from Copernicus to Darwin) and addresses them intelligently.A book that is destined to be a classic. If Christianity has a future, it will resemble this. The fairy-tale stuff is doomed."
3,Good critique of christianity but what now?,"Bishop Spong's critique of christianity is reasonably fair and accurate. However I don't think that talking of the ""ground of being"" etc as a replacement for the traditional theistic God would mean much to most people including myself. None of the alternatives to theistic religions can really speak to our emotional needs. Maybe in the end all there really is to life is to live for the moment."
4,It's about time!,"As one who rejected organized religion many years ago I found Spong's book very good for those Christians who cannot reconcile some of the differences within the pages of the Bible.It nicely lays out why the Christian Spong does not reject Jesus as divine and tells us how we all have the capacity to divinity. It gives hope and faith through his questions and answers within our own time (and many scientific discoveries) not through the lens of thousands of years and many misconceptions about our world.I hope Spong continues to speak out, reform is needed within religions whos voice's cry out that we need to be controlled to earn grace.VOdienexp"
3,Spong is a muslim in diguise,"As I read the book, I couldn't help but wonder aloud ""who on the face of the earth believes in and loves Christ, yet denies his divinity?"" And the answer hit me like a ton of bricks, 1.4 billion muslims! Surely Spong has committed a greivuos crime against the church and fundamentalists. Perhaps he should check his collar at the door of the mosque?"
1,Hypocracy,"Spong attacks and denies every distinctive point of Christianity while continuing to draw the salary and enjoy the privileges of, and generally trade on being, a Christian bishop. That is rank hypocracy.The errors and silliness of fundamentalism are beside the point. I laugh at fundamentalists but would rather be an honest if mistaken fundamentalist than in the state of this bishop."
1,"Boy, Did This Guy Get a Wrong Number!","Christianity, the real kind, not the atheism and moral relativism pushed by the author of this book, is growing by leaps and bounds. Meanwhile, no legitimate Christian wants to go to ""churches"" like those presided over by left-wing social activists posing as clergymen, e. g., Bishop Spong. Pretty soon, if not already, Spong's whole congregation will consist of nothing but Sodomites and Marxists.Christianity doesn't need to change, but Christians need to give a wide berth to the ""liberation"" advocated by Spong and his kind. Otherwise, they might find themselves ""liberated"" like the Christians in China and Cuba."
1,Awful...,"Well, I read roughly a paragraph of this book before I put it back on the library shelf. Honestly, a ""non-theistic view of God?!?!?!?!?!"" Come on."
1,"Apostasy, Pure and Simple","The man is a non-believer. I am sorry that he does not believe in the Bible or the Christ contained within, but do not deceive others, please."
1,This book is absolutely blasphemous.,The Bible says in the end times there will be false prophets... right here is one of them.
4,Great book for the open minded,"Religion traditionalists of all faiths are going to hold on to their beliefs at all costs. Each faith is convinced they alone know ""The Truth"" and all the other beliefs are wrong. This book is meant for people who aren't afraid to confront old dogmas and it is meant for people who have faced the reality that the bible is the word of man. There is no ""Big Daddy"" in the sky to tell us what to do. The traditionalist church wants us to continue being ""sheep"". We have to grow up and be responsible for ourselves. Bishop Spong offers some light on steps towards that goal."
4,Thoughts of an x-christian,"I'd been hearing about the Right Reverend Spong on atheist message boards for awhile now and I thought I'd enjoy seeing what all of the talk was about. This title appealed to me the most because I enjoy studying christian history and have felt that literalist christianity is a vile and dangerous set of ideas (along with other fundamentalist belief systems). If the ideas he posits here could ever be actualized and if they could replace what exists today, then the world would be a much better place. Alas, I highly doubt that this will ever occur in my lifetime, if ever. His christianity is one that most all non-monotheists could respect and embrace in the free market of ideas. Follow this book up with ""The Jesus Mysteries"", by Freke & Gandy and ""Jesus and the Lost Goddess"", by the same authors. Believe me, if you liked this book you will love these two even more."
1,Hypocritical nonsense for the weakminded,"A quick question for all those who gave this absurd rant a good review: If a hypocritical, confused old man came to you and tried to sell you a new religion, would you be buying?If you gave this book high marks, you just did!"
1,Shame to the shepard that leads sheep astray!,"Mr. Spong should drop any affiliation with the Christian and/or Episcipal church. His writings go against the Bible and sadly, he will be held accountable someday for his false teachings. Christianity will not die because it doesn't change. That is the joy of loving a God that never changes and is always the same, yesterday, today and forever. He is a Saviour and the only way to eternal life is thru Jesus Christ. I'm sure Mr. Spong will face eternal death before Christianity does if he does not repent and truly give his life to the one that created him."
1,The Bishop nears the end of his abandonment of the Christ.,"Unfortunately, amazon.com limits the bottom rating to one star. This book, while tolerably written, is an intellectually dishonest book. The Bishop has abandoned the wide spectrum of belief generated by the Christian church (in all its branches and denominations) for nearly 2,000 years. The Bishop is actually creating a new religion, which we might as well call Spongism; he creates a false idol and calls it the Christ. It is revealing that he calls anyone who disagrees with him part of the ""religious right"" ignoring the fact that his critics run across the political and religious spectrum. Spongism is a very narrow, intolerant sect -- this book is its high scripture. Regrettably, it is a complete and total abandonment of Jesus and his church."
4,Excellent but Not That Historical,"As someone who has read loads of Historical Writings about the early Church and what the Gospels are about from a non-theogical point of view, I found much of the research in this book weak. In fact, I wished Spong had talked about the churches in the United States that have allready gone down the path that Spong suggested and what has happen to them, i.e. Christain Science and Unity. It is, however, a easy read and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting to question what is happening in traditional churches and why."
2,More tired old liberal theology-from Tillich to Spong,"This is one of the finer examples of the result of following the theology of Paul Tillich-one leaves the oasis thinking that there must be something new to explore, and ends up getting lost in the desert, never to return. Such has been Bishop Spong's spiritual path.Though well written and easy to understand, Spong's book is ultimately a heretical bishop's rehashing of mid-century Tillichian theology, warmed over for semi-educated laymen. Spong makes himself and those on the same theological journey out to be spiritual heroes for departing from traditional Christian orthodoxy, but ultimately the stand he takes must be considered rather uncourageous, both spiritually as well as intellectually. ""Death of God"" theologies, such as the one propounded in this book, and utilizing ""demythologization"" techniques from the biblical studies realm, ultimately all fail in that they fail to give a rationally-based sense of hope to their adherents."
1,Reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated...,"I could say a great deal about the book, but I'll content myself with answering the title. And I'll do it by quoting a man the Rt. Rev. +Spong has apparently never read, G.K. Chesterton:""Christianity has died many times and risen again; for it had a God who knew the way out of the grave."""
3,An intellectual exercise.,"Spong's new work is all about a formidable and powerful intellect totally frustrated in its proud efforts to encompass and conquer and possess the Holy, so it shapes for itself by logic and reason and some deconstruction that which permits it to continue and flourish without the pain of Mystery.Been there, done that, lost the same battle, thank God!"
3,Why Christianity Must Change or Lose the Intelligentsia,"Bishop Spong should have named this book ""Why Christianity Must Change or Lose the Intelligentsia."" Another reviewer is correct in stating that Christianity is growing (and that the mainline Christian churches are shrinking). Christianity is not in danger of dying, but it is in danger of losing the intellectual classes. Fundamentalist Christianity and academic intellectualism are antithetical: one provides dogmatic, unquestionable answers; the other continually asks questions and is open to debate.There are two possible outcomes to this impasse: 1) The intelligentsia can become completely irreligious and unchurched. 2) A new flavor of Christianity can be developed that is reconcilable with modern science and mores.Spong's short-sightedness is in declaring that this new flavor of Christianity should become THE Christianity for everyone."
1,SO SAD!,This author has surly become disallusioned with his religion and is trying to bend it to his liking.
1,"Painful read. Nice try, but no dice.","This book was probably one of the most painful reads in a long time. Spong makes a mess out of theology. If I were an Episcopalian, I'd be pretty damn embarrassed.I can only think that the only people who would like this would be ""freethinking"" Baby Boomers who are still freewheeling in revolutionary ideologies."
2,Nice try...,"I believe the Wittenberg Door said it best, ""Spong calls himself a beleiver in exile because it sounds better than unbeliever."" Although Spong makes a serviceable argument in this book, what he ends up with is something other than Christianity. That's fine and dandy, but if it doesn't look like a duck and doesn't quack like a duck, it ain't a duck. Spong also presents a lot of academic theories and scholarly debated issues as if they were universally agreed upon by theologians and biblical scholars. It sounds good if you are unfamiliar with the field but if you have a background in these areas you see that he often bases his arguments on positions that are by no means accepted widely among scholars. Worth a read if you can check it out from your library but not worth the money."
1,No surprises here,"I am a Christian. I was baptized and confirmed in the Episcopal Church, and I cringe everytime I think about Spong being an Episcopal bishop. How can anyone be a Christian if he doesn't believe in the divinity of Christ?This is a great book for people who think Jesus was just a nice guy who lived in Israel about 2000 years ago. It's not a book for people who have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior."
1,A good example of bad reasoning,"Spong sets up a version of Christianity appropriate for a four year old, bulldozes over it, and then believes he's actually accomplished something. Anyone naive enough to think that hundreds of millions of Christians all over the world have never heard of Newton or Darwin, or really believe in a God who exists ""Up in the sky"" or any of the other silly ideas he tries to pass off as part of traditional Christianity will certainly enjoy having their prejudices reinforced in this book. What is extremely interesting and revealing is the fact that he attacks the ""intolerance"" of traditional Christians so much, yet clearly believes that anyone who doesn't think like him must be stupid. Spong is simply another flash in the pan. Far from dying, 100 years from now no one will remember Spong, and Christianity will be chugging along as well as ever. And just for the record I am NOT a fundamentlaist."
1,Brainless drivel,"The book is a shallow attempt to try and explain what the author cannot explain. Simply put, he can not explain God or why what happens, happens. Therefore, Christanity's explantaion can not be true or valid. What is true and valid? The author has no idea. This person demands that God be logical and understandable to HIM or he will not acknowledge the existence or correctness of God. Who is God in this thought process? Spong seems to make himself that, perhaps unconcsiously."
5,Important issues are raised here,"Although the title of this volume may seem shocking to some of my fellow Christians, Bishop Spong is to be congratulated for raising the important issues discussed in this book. The section on theism, which is arguably the central theological issue of the 21st century, would alone make this book worth the read. But I would commend the entire book to anyone who wants to discard the dysfunctional elements of Christianity and move beyond them to ""the truth as it is in Jesus"" (Ephesians 4:21). Spong admits he doesn't have answers to all of the questions he has raised, but we can all be grateful to him for raising them. The fact that an Episcopalian Bishop has dared to speak out in this way is really quite wonderful -- it gives one some hope for the Church of the future."
4,The Prison of Beliefs,"For me, Zen Buddhism has been a way to bring me back to Christianity -- as a practice, NOT a set of rigid beliefs. Why so much venom directed at Spong? Is he the enemy because he does not believe as you do? ""Love your enemies"" -- where have I heard that before? I think that if we all take a deep breath, clear our minds, then we can find peace with ourselves, and realize that it is how we treat each other, not what we believe, that truly matters. In some ways, Spong is trying to say that. There's so much hatred out there, and so much good Christian work to be done. Let's not throw our stones at each other but get down to the business of doing our work."
2,News to me,"Did I miss something? Since when is Christianity dying? The latest world statistics show it to be making steady growth (Buddhism is deteriorating, however). The figures on the Epsicopal church, however, are revealing. Spong's own diocese has lost at least half its members and the Episcopal church in the USA continues to lose members to a dramatic degree. Pentecostal churches are surging, Catholicism is showing steady growth, etc. It is only the most theologically liberal churches which are hemorrhaging members. When you lose theological content, disaster results. God as ""an immanent Hummmm-m-m-m"" isn't going to sustain anyone's faith - and won't keep the pews filled. Give it time and Spong and his followers will be an obscure footnote to the history of late 20th century Christianity."
4,The Church Shall Die,"Spong believes that Jesus was a human who lived life so fully and with such passion that his followers saw him as God Incarnate. His life was interpreted in theistic terms in retrospect. Spong depicts Jesus as the preacher of universal love, and grounds his devotion to the Church on that principle. However, he does not consider many of the sayings of Jesus that serve to break humanity apart into two camps: the saved and the damned. While he states that he does not take the text literally (which is why he can ignore what he does not like), he does not explain how he can worship such a man while ignoring much of what Jesus is reported to have said. His proposed reformation is not Christianity; it is another universalist, and pantheistic religion."
1,Spong's church already exists...,"Spong wants major junking of essential Christian dogmas. The resulting church already exists. It is called the Unitarian church. You are all welcome to go there if you wish. No one will care what you say or do or believe there as - anything goes there and it is the last stop before being completely unchurched. Those who believe, however, that the Church properly is built on the foundation of the apostles and creeds should allign themselves with the Anglican continuing wing of the church. Better yet, find a church in the Anglican Province of Christ the King (they have a website) and leave the spongites to themselves."
1,Is Changed Christianity Christian?,"Dr. Spong is articulate and experienced in church life, but lacking in the wisdom of God which fears changing His words in the face of cultures which are ashamed and even despise His truth.How much can one modify before the modified doesn't resemble the real thing? Thanks be to God that Spong is not a spokesman for the Christian faith."
1,This is bad theology,"Mr. Spong's treatment of Biblical data is fast and loose. He is quite content to accept the ""scientific evidence"" of evolution without a mention of its contraversial nature. He has ignored all responsible biblical scholarship for a cracker-jack version liberal scam. In essence Mr. Spong has taken the best of what he likes in the culture and the Bible and called it a belief system. The Bible is not a salad bar. He has created a new religion of his own making based on telling everyone that they are okay no matter how they live. It appeals to people because he tells them what they want to hear. I would say that Mr. Spong's version of Christianity must indeed change or die."
2,George,The poor author seems more dedicated to destroying christianity that really trying to fix it. Most of what he wants to throw away was settled in the first three centuries of christianity after much debate. If he is so displeased with christianity why does he not just create a new religion like so many others who have in the past and even in the present?I wish he the best but I'm sure I will see this work in the clearance bin rather quickly.
1,Spong's best yet,"This collection of tired and intellectually nugatory heresies are the best thing Spong has produced yet. It does not quite rise to the level of utter stupidity, but is straining up towards it."
2,Too bad he gave up ...,"This bishop sure created some controversy with this one, so I had to see for myself rather than rely on other people's opinions.I found myself agreeing with most of the first half of the book - the role of women and some other issues the church clearly mishandled for centuries, some of which are being rectified now. But in the second half the poor bishop goes astray and settles for too little - he gives up on the supernatural, and as a result offers a god who is no more than 'the ground of being'. So sad.If this is all there is, we are to be pitied indeed. Fortunately there is more to life - a spiritual dimension we can discover for the rest of our lives. Too bad this bishop gave up."
1,Inadvertant argument for dismantling Christianity,"If Spong is right, then one would be much better off staying in bed on Sunday. Why waste your time going to church? He performs a masterful job of making Christianity look inconceivably silly. That is, if he is right. Essentially, he wants to remove every indispensable element of Christianity and substitute something that is uninteresting and bland in its place. Will we ever some to the end of silly books like this one?"
1,Gimme a break! This isn't Christianity!,"Christianity--by virtue of its divine founder--cannot change. If it changes, it isn't Christianity any longer. There are certain doctrines which are an integral part of Christianity, and to deny those is to deny the very basis for our faith. Unfortunately, Mr. Spong (who doesn't even deserve to be a bishop) seems to have conveniently forgotten this in order to continue in his own sin."
2,Not as machine washable as I had hoped,"I bought this bag because I think it's ridiculous that diaper bags aren't ALL machine washable. However, when I washed it, the filler materials, the inner layers that allow the bag to be stiff enough to stand up, fell apart completely. I was left with a bag that is floppy and loose. In addition, it just didn't wash up well. I had taken it to a pancake breakfast at church where we got syrup dripped on it, and the syrup didn't wash out! It wasn't something that is normally hard to wash out...just pancake syrup, but it left big dirty marks behind. If you want a good machine washable bag, spend the extra money and get a Hoohobbers...I have one of those now and it washes up beautifully."
1,never got it,"I woulod not know how to rate this item seeing how I paid for it and never got it. When I tried to contact the seller, I never got responce"
5,Why I bought A Genesis,I found this game at a yard sale for 50 cents. I didnt know what console it was for but 6 games for 50 cents has to be a good deal. SO I bought it and a few days later also bought a genesis for $20. This was the only game I ever had for it and the only game I ever needed for it. BE careful with it though my circuit part broke off on accident
1,This is not scholarship,"If you have already chosen to think that ""racist"" white academics and theologians have been covering up the ""truth,"" then this book will serve to confirm that which you have already chosen to believe. So buy it, read it, and remain convinced. It won't change your mind, nor will it provide you with any verifiable facts about anything at all. But if you are looking not for facts but instead for esteem-building mythology and fanciful tall tales, this is the book for you.If, on the other hand, you actually have some interest in the ancient world and in the origins of modern religion, do not waste your time or money on this or any other work by the notoriously counterfactual Dr. Ben. Start elsewhere."
5,Great Reading,"When I started reading this book I could not put it down it was too thrilling. I like to guess how these kinds of books end but in this book I just had no clue, so this book I put as a number 1 in reading."
5,Just what I needed!,"This book is absolutely wonderful for parents of children with SPD. It is chock-full of great ideas for fun activities that are safe and appropriate for these special children, as well as fun for the other children in your life! My 4 year old daughter is an SPD kid and she has enjoyed these activities right along side her 6 year old sister and 2 year old brother."
4,"A great resource, badly formatted for Kindle","A great resource for parents of children with Sensory Processing Disorder. I'm always looking for new activities to add to my daughter's ""sensory diet."" This book is full of great ideas, broken down into easy to handle sections, and with good descriptions of what your child with SPD might be experiencing.I should have probably read ""The Out of Sync Child"" but didn't find it absolutely necessary in order to use this book.I did have some problems with the formatting on the Kindle version, however. I don't blame that on the book, just the publisher/whoever formats the books for digital reading. I haven't tried it on the laptop yet, but I'm disappointed in the formatting errors. IT makes a nicely broken up book really really hard to decipher at times. If you're going to buy it, get a paper version."
4,Very handy book,My wife bought this as per the advice of one of her friends and our daughter's occupational therapist. She found it very handy and good read.
4,Adopted children have some special need when initial life was in an orphanage,"Adopted children have some extra special needs when initial life was in an orphanage. This book covered alot of ground. I just still felt a little helpless yet, even after reading it. But is worth the time and the purchase."
5,This was so educational on Sensory disorders!,This was an easy read for parents who want to know what Sensory Processing disorder is. I have a child with SPD so this was extremely helpful to help me learn exactly what it was and how to handle any problems that I might have with her. It also has a whole section of activities to do with your sensory child.
4,"Look Beyond ""Can't You See""","The debut album of the Marshall Tucker Band contains the band's signature song ""Can't You See."" For a brief time back in the mid-1970s, MTB challenged Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers for southern rock supremacy. Less rocking and more country oriented than either of those bands, MTB created some excellent music beyond their occasional hit. After ""Can't You See,"" the debut album contains the excellent songs ""Take the Highway,"" ""See You Later, I'm Gone"" and the gospel flavored ""My Jesus Told Me So."" The rest of the material isn't bad, either.Overall, MTB's debut album is a fine example of mid 70s southern rock."
4,Prime Marshall Tucker,This is one of the best Marshall Tucker Band albums to come out in the '70s. It is one of the few where Toy Caldwell's vocals are prominent.
3,THIS IS NOT THE DEBUT,"This is not the debut album for The Marshall Tucker Band, and, sadly, it does not include ""Take The Highway"" or ""Can't You See""; with that said, however, it's not a bad collection if you have no others and you get it at a low price."
5,a rich source for the world's best quotes on healing.,"this book is just wonderful... give it to anyone who is suffering physically, mentally, or spiritually. almost every page offers a prayer, quote, poem or passage that is deeply gratifying."
4,McCoy Madness,"I can just remember a few episodes from the Real McCoys from when I was a child. I was excited to see the first two seasons out on dvd. I know we lost a few minutes of each episode, but they are still well worth the price. The Real McCoys is a great sitcom, so much better than almost anything they have out today. The only real problem is they haven't released the other seasons."
5,Cornerstone of modern American history,"What a joy to discover this long-lost gem of 1950's American culture! I haven't seen these shows for forty years, but I still fondly remember several episodes. Good wholesome fun for the whole family. My children are hooked, and I am glad. I certainly hope that the following seasons are made available."
5,Real McCoy!,"Boy, does this bring back memories! Walter Brennan was great, I had a major crush on Kathy Nolan, what a sweetie. I remember watching this on TV during the 60's reruns (Mon - Fri mornings)...Please release all 6 seasons so I can have them all. Thanks"
3,THE REAL McCOYS COMPLETE SEASON 1,"Season 1 does NOT have ""PLAY ALL""Very sad.Seasons 2-4 however do have ""Play all""I would NOT have bought Season one hadI known there was no ""Play ALL"""
3,Can you smell whats cooking?,"Its a good cook book, but it is not traditional chinese cooking, the recipes use nontraditional ingredients in their recipes. More like the flavors of chinese cooking. Other then that, its pretty decent recipes for beginners. Bilingual, spanish and english, plenty of pictures!!!"
4,Very good!,"Much better than Beats by Dre, Though the beats bass is a little better, clarity is much better though! Enjoy"
5,Fabulous!,"I looove these Sennheiser! Excellent quality for a great price. Very comfortable. These are the best headphones, regardless of price."
3,Love these headphones. Sad they broke. In two.,"I've had these 555s for a little over a year. They sound most excellent. The reviews that address their sound quality are spot-on. It's just... they broke. The left earpiece just snapped plumb off. A couple of months ago I noticed cracks forming, and last week I had two headphones. Not as good as a pair of headphones. Not good at all. Ok... is it unreasonable to fall asleep wearing headphones? That's all I did. I'm not a violent sleeper. Honest. Maybe I snore a bit, but quality headphones should be able to handle snoring, yes? So... love the sound, but bummed about the durability. Just saying."
3,Pretty Decent,"It's been about a year or so since I purchased these headphones, so I thought I might review them. These are pretty good headphones! The bass is very good, and everything is balanced just right for my music taste. Sometimes I like to play some rock, then dubstep, and classical. It's great for the bass drops, and good for other music as well, though I was lucky enough to get these back when they were 80 BUCKS! At this price, you might want to look elsewhere, however. Even at the price I paid for these, I think it was a bit much for what I actually got."
3,"Snap, Crackle, Pop!","These headphone sound really good, depending on what kind of music you are listening to. I listen to a lot of atmospheric music with a lot of layers... This is where these headphones shine. All the layers of music come in really sharp, clear, and focused. I feel like they do a really nice job separating all the different sounds. The one complaint I have with these headphones is they crackle and pop when I listen to my music past a certain volume... Maybe I am turning the volume up too loud? If that is the volume I want to listen to music they should be able to handle it. A slight volume adjustment always fixes the problem. I wonder if this problem will get worse later on down the road though?"
3,how they feel,I'm having a hard time finding the right position on my head. At most times they feel too tight. A bit too much pressure on the ears.
3,Decent pair of $60-80 headphones,"It's not worth $100+ I wish I could try the HD-595's because as soon as I got these out of the box and put them on I wanted to return them. They hurt the top of my head and the sides are so tight they squeeze my head so bad. I tried stretching them out by putting them on something wider then my head when I'm not using them but that only works to a certain point. When I turn up the bass it distorts the sound too. I found that very strange for a pair of $100 ""audiophile"" headphones. I've heard a whole lot from many people about how comfortable these headphones are, but they are pretty damn uncomfortable for me."
3,GOOD BUT NOT OUTSTANDING,"I must have a tin ear, because these headphones did not sound all that wonderful to me. While the sound is certainly very good, they did not produce the super clear, bright sound many of the other reviewers rave about and for which I know Sennheiser is famous. I can say, however, that they are very comfortable. You probably shouldn't base your decision on my experience with these headphones."
3,"Headphones OK, but not spectacular.","I bought these to use with my iPod while riding in a van pool. I am surprised that they don't block out ANY noise and if you turn it up very loud, others hear your music which can be very distracting. I should have gone with some that had noise cancelling. However, because these were over the ears, I thought much (not all) of the noise would be muted. NOT so. I had an older pair of headphones (different brand) that did much better. Also the jack for the iPod has an adapter and is very large; makes the iPod heavy in your shirt pocket.The sound is good, but not great. I'm a little disappointed esp. since these cost >$100. I expected better quality. Your call, but I wouldn't buy another pair of these.Maybe the previous reviewers who gave them high marks had theirs really cranked up high; anything shounds good then. I've had equal ones for 50% of the price."
2,Not THAT good.,"The sound is fine...but:Zero noise reduction...ZERO! People on the other side of the room can hear what I'm listening and I can hear ALL sounds around.The $22 Senheiser headphones are way more comfortable AND reduce noise better.I'm a female (smaller dimensions than a men), and these headphones were making the joint of my jaw (Temporomandibular joint) hurt after 2 hours of use. NOT COMFY.I'm returning them, having to pay now aprox. 25 bucks in fees to get them credited...mmmmm."
5,Great!,"beware though, it's OPEN.it means everyone can hear you!other thought:bought it a year ago for $80now it's $170?I think I just make $90!!"
2,"Sounded Good, Not a Good Fit","These headphones sound great and I really wanted to keep them, but alas, it was not to be. These headphones squeeze my head terribly, despite me having an average sized dome. After about 20-30 minutes of trying to convince myself it wasn't that big of a deal, I started to develop a headache, and back they went.If anyone is interested, I ended up getting theSony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, and they are infinitely more comfortable and sound just as good."
3,disappointed,"I bought these based on reading the other reviews here. When i tried them, I found them to be too bulky for my liking, and I was disappointed with the high notes, which were crackly more often than not. (and it wasn't that i had them turned up to loud!) My musical taste is very eclectic, and I tried them over a handful of different genres. Unfortunately they just didn't sound as good as I hoped, so I returned them. I am still looking for a replacement pair; next time i will know to choose on-ear headphones, rather than over-ear."
3,Sennheiser HD555 Professional Head Phones,"This product was nicely packaged. The head phones themselves are seemingly the most comfortable possible for this product. I am not an audiophile, however from my experience with stereo devices headphones are mediocre which is consistent with their cost."
3,"Good quality headphones, overpriced though ...","I was incredibly excited and had high expectations of these headphones. I am a electrical engineer and hobbyist-audiophile, so I was expecting some incredible sound. I received the headphones with high expectations due to their audiophile label and having a THD of less than .2%! I believed that for the price listed, this was a steal! However, I was sadly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, they sound GOOD, but not great. The highs and mids are great, however the lows are shameful. If you love bass or need quality bass in your headphones, then please be aware that these headphones do NOT deliver. Aside from that, the headphones are comfortable and seem to made of good quality. Also, note that they do require a 24 hour ""break-in"", but breaking speakers in is nothing new for quality speakers.In conclusion, the headphones ARE good! Aside from terrible lows, the sound quality is great. I just feel like they are overpriced for the sound received."
2,Looks can be deceiving,Well I ordered these headphones purely based on the fact that they are Sennheiser.First of all these headphones are quite uncomfortable. They are tight around the ears and puts undo pressure on the head.The sound quality is mediocore and people can hear whatever you are listening to. The bass is almost nonexisitant and the highs are too high.
3,I don't get the hype.,"It is comfortable. The sound quality is Ok.It has pretty much the same sound quality as a pair of 20$ jbud/creative sound reducing earphones without the noise reduction part.If you are in a quiet environment, everyone near you will hear your music. People have complained to me.The cords are ridiculously long and the adapter ridiculously huge (about the size of my mp3 player).Even after 100 hours of burn in, it still sounds...lacking. I've read a few reviews where they ""claim"" to be as if it was some one next to them playing the music. Such is not the case for me.I do not understand the overrated reviews.Mediocre at best.Definitely NOT worth the price."
2,Good quality sound... for me and everyone else in the $#&!ing room!,"These headphones provide good quality sound. But Sennheiser's open-ear technology defeats the purpose of headphones. Yeah, the sound may be good, but everyone around you can hear what you're listening to. Forget about taking these on a plane, unless you want to anger the fat alcoholic next to you who just wants to get some shuteye.Also, the main plug is the big kind. It has an attachment for regular plugs like i-pods, or your computer, etc., but it's not very long. I found that it didn't fit well in my computer or my sound system and as a result, I often received sound out of only one ear.I guess if you like good sound, but can't have the music thumping for the neighbors to wake-up to, then this is a good product. But don't expect your girlfriend to be happy with you when she's trying to watch ""Animal Cops"" or ""Say Yes to the Dress"" or whateverthe%&#@ever when you are rocking out to the Star Wars soundtrack in the same room."
4,Best headphones I've ever owned,"In the past I wore headphones and didn't really care much for how it sounded. It wasn't until I purchased this pair that I realized how much I was missing out on when I'd use headphones. This pair is extremely comfortable, even though they are huge. They have a terrible amount of bleed, so if you're planning on wearing them around other people, expect them to hear it too, unless you enjoy listening with the volume down very low.Overall I'm very happy with them, they do not offer an overabundance of bass, but they are audiophile targeted headphones so it is something to expect. I have never heard any distortion out of them and I've been using them for over 6 months. Going back to other headphones is always a shock to me now because the audio quality is so much lower. These will help to increase your appreciation for quality sound."
5,A well-rounded alternative to Bose,"I bought these headphones for my son and the equivalent around the ears headphones from Bose for my daughter. Both are very good headphones, but I prefer the sound from the Sennheiser, which is more well-rounded, warm and accurate, while I would describe the Bose as brighter and with more bass. If you play with or are familiar with how different pianos sound, the difference in sound reproduction is similar to comparing a European or Steinway piano (Sennheiser) and a Yamaha piano (Bose). Some folks prefer headphones that boost in the high and low end, which to my ears has a bit of artificaliality, while I prefer headphones that reproduce the sound accurately across the sound spectrum. Other observations: The Bose are lighter and create a tighter seal around the ear, thus eliminating more outside noise, while the Sennheiser are less expensive. Anyway, these are a great set of headphones."
5,all as expected and more,my sennheiser's have delivered all my expectations and more. I use them with both my stereo music system and hi-def dvd viewing. They are priced appropriately for the value received. I would definitely recommend to others.
3,I returned it,"After all the glowing reviews here, I ordered these headphones and got them two days later. I wasn't quite as impressed as the rest of the group here. I felt the bass was lacking, and the sound escaped the headphones more than I wanted to, especially for headphones that completely covered my ears. I like to listen to music late at night and the music was too loud for my wife (and I barely had them cranked). I simply wasn't blown away by the quality of the sound -- they were good headphones, but not great or excellent.I will say that these are extremely comfortable headphones, but the sound quality wasn't worth the price. They went back to Amazon today."
2,Beware!,"I like these phones, the sound quality is very good and they have held up well. The problem is with the cord. It comes from the factory tightly coiled, and no matter what I try I can't get the coil out. Several times a day you wil have to unplug the cord and unwind the the twisted coil. It seems to do it on its own. It had a memory that tells it to twist up and become a 2-3 foot cord instead of 10-12 feet.I would not but it again."
3,absolutely overrated,"Don't be mislead by the ""audiophile"" tag on these headphones. Comfortable, yes, but the sound was muffled, not crisp, and not much better than good earbuds or much cheaper headphones. An overall disappointment."
5,Fantastic,"Amazing, the only word that can truly describe these headphones...Extremely comfortable, an unreal clarity, and great bass...everything you could want in a pair of headphones...at least ones less than $300...I've only had these for a very short time and I like to crank my music so we'll see how tough they are in the long run but I'd say worth the money either way...and for 95 bucks (or even the msrp of $170) the price is definately right...on another note the velour is a great touch, really adds to the comfort and it comes in some VERY nice packaging...5 stars all the way"
5,Fantastic,My Son is a recording Engineer. I bought these headphones for him for Christmas. He Loves them. I bought another one for my other son for his B-Day. They sound fantastic!
4,Great (not perfect) headphones,"Pros:relatively inexpensive comparativelysounds greatcomfortable even with my big headKeeps outside noise out pretty wellCons:velour earpads can make your head HOToutside of headphones has no noise dampening - anyone nearby can hear what you are listening toI'm happy with the headphones in spite of the cons - because at pretty much any volume the headphones put out sound through the back of the earpads and anyone nearby can hear. I wish the velour earpads didn't turn my head into a furnace, but all over the ear headphones are bad to some extent, and the velour is more comfortable. People complain about the long cord but I've come to expect that with high quality headphones and it's actually beneficial in one scenario so I'll live with it. If you want great sound at a reasonable price and don't care if anyone else would get bothered by the noise, then these are a great buy."
4,hear every detail,"I bought these when my Sony MDR-XD200 headphones broke (my fault, not the manufacturer). I thought they were about the same (though the Sony's were only $20) but it turns out my work computer has poor audio output. Listened to these on a personal computer and could hear every detail. Definitely worth it if you are listening to something with above average output but won't blow you away if the source doesn't allow. These are great headphones (comfortable, clear sound, good bass) but if you're in my situation, go with the MDR-XD200 instead. You won't notice the difference. If you have something with good outputs, these are worth the upgrade."
5,Teenager loves them!,A well received 18 year old birthday gift. Great sound and much relief for Mom knowing he won't be deaf from ear buds by the time he's 30. The headphones are comfortable and keep most of the noise out.
4,very comfortable headphones,"Read lots of reviews and comments and picked these up for just over $100., an excellent value. Very comfortable, even when wearing eyeglasses, excellent ergonomics. Ease of use lost a star due to the funky 1/4"" to mini one piece adapter which is useless in a lot of situations. Too bad, since the set has a nice long cord. Very easy to listen to for extended periods, no audio fatigue noticed with this set. Comparable in audio detail to my AKG K171MK2 closed cup studio phones (about $200.), although a completely different sound character - much more spacious sounding, which is to be expected with the open air design. I bought these primarily for watching video although be aware that they leak a lot and may disturb others in the same or nearby rooms. All listening is done using a home made Cmoy design headphone amp and the improvement is noticeable."
5,I really forgot my music sounded this good!,"I've been one of those people that really only listen to their music on an iPod for several years know. Although I really like my apple earbuds, I decided to get a better set of head phones for listening to my music on the computer (earbud cord is way to short). I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and CNET and I settled on these for $94. I've been using them for a few weeks and my music just sounds so much better. The head phones are very comfortable and have a nice long cord. One thing to remember is that these are not noise canceling in any way. You can very easily hear everything going on around you once the music stops. Overall I'm completely satisfied with the purchase, and as always with Amazon's price and delivery."
3,"Excalect sound, but threat jently!","Excellent sound quality (not hifi-nut), unfortunately they break really easily. I dropped them twice on concrete like floor and the fall was about 1 meter from my desk. Plastic cracked a bit above the ""speaker"" where plastic is at it thinnest. Few months later left ""speaker"" was hanging by the wires. I feel that headphones should not brake on 1 meter fall so i gave this product 3 out of 5. other wise these are full 5/5 headphones."
4,Good value for the money.,"I bought it mainly because of very good review it received from various professional magazines.Sound quality seems to be adequate to money you pay for it. It seems to be rather natural and transparent, so you if you're looking for this 'oomp' bass you probably won't find it here. However if you're into clear, 'studio' sound this is the way to go. Lows are low enough and clear, high are crisp but not to bright so for me it's what I like.In terms of design & built quality they seems to be constructed very well, design is modern and they look very professional. They are very comfortable thanks to plush padding. Cable is very long."
4,solid audiophile headphones,"Purchased the Senn's has needed a replacement for 30 year old AKG's. Researched the brands, and although loved the AKG's, decided to take chance on Senn's based on positive user reviews found.So far have not been disappointed! For both vinyl and cd, sound quality seems well balanced. They are a little 'clunkier' then my old AKG's, however they are still pretty light, and comfortable. I would prefer a little longer cord, but this just based on distance between my receiver, and couch where listen from.Delivery as usual was quick and efficient by Amazon. Have had for about 5 months, highly recommend so far!"
5,Great entry to mid level audiophile headphones,"Hands down these are probably the best headphones you can get that don't need a separate amp to power them.I had some KOSS PRO4AAT's and they were just too powerful for my devices... I couldn't get the correct sound out of them (admittedly.. they ARE 250 ohms... so they require quite an amp-- they're made for broadcasting equipment) They were also a tad uncomfortable... These are so comfortable sometimes I forget they're on my head... and I wear glasses!The sound quality has been good no matter what I throw at them. I like the occasional techno track, love acoustic rock, death metal, world music, folk, and most other music. They continue to impress me. I cheated and burned them in over about 36hrs so I could get a head start on the burn in process and they sound absolutely wonderful.I also play games such as World of Warcraft, Battlefield 2 and 2142, and Warhammer Dawn of War. All the games sound great!Get these headphones! You won't be disappointed."
5,Really Diggin' These Headphones,"I use these headphone ALL THE TIME. I use them when listening to music on my laptop, I use them when I want to be in quiet mode through my guitar amp, when I'm chillin' in the hammock outside, ALL. THE. TIME.They leak some sound being open ear, but not an insane amount. That being said, not the best headphones if you're working in a cube or riding the bus/subway.For the price, these puppies cannot be beat in my opinion. I have owned many-a-pair of headphones, a couple in the same price range, and these are my favorites out of the bunch. They are comfortable on the head and sound fantastic."
4,"Cracks developing and the dreaded 1/4"" plug","These really are great sounding headphones, but there are cracks in the plastic that are creeping further into the frame. It looks like it will eventually break. And of course, it would have been nice to have a 1/8"" jack with a slim 1/4"" adapter. I would even buy the adapter separately. Sennheiser, are you listening???!!!"
2,Distorted After A Week,"I used these headphones for one week and they were great. After a week they sounded distorted like the speakers were blown out. I only listened to these on a small Ipod and small MP3 players. Never loud, never full volume, and I only listened to them while sitting in a chair. I don't know how they got distorted but the headphones were useless. I sent them back and after 33 days I still have not recieved replacements. I should of bought them from Amazon directly, but instead I purchased them thru one of their vendors.I learned a couple of lessons: 1) Even great products self-destruct and 2) try to buy directly from Amazon.com because they have a superior return policy."
4,Buy Grado SR60 and save yourself $30,"This one is overrated.I own both SR60 and HD555. However, HD555 is somewhat disappointing. Sound is veiled when connected straight to a computer or mp3 player. For vocals, it sounds like someone is singing behind a curtain. It can even be difficult to understand the lyrics sometimes. When I connected this through an amplifier (one self made and one ""bit head""), this goes away, and every word sounds clear and crispy. As a comparison SR60 doesn't care much whether amplified or not, and always performs very well.So my point is: if you have to use this with an amplifier, why not buying something as good (or better) that doesn't require an amplifier? For similar sound quality (in my opinion, actually SR60 is slightly better), SR60 is at least $30 cheaper and doesn't need to be amplified, should be a much better deal if all you care is sound quality."
4,Great sound,Excellent low and high response headphones. The only gripe I have is that everyone can hear what you're listening to even at low volume.
5,Very Nice Headphones,"I've had these well over a month now.These are superior headphones with superior sound quality. My primary reason for purchasing these was gaming. I play America's Army, Guild Wars, and World of Warcraft. In America's Army I was able to hear footsteps and people reloading from a far greater distances than with my Zalman 5.1's (which were $90) or with my Logitech open ear headphones. The accuracy of the shots were even better than my 5.1's. Which is amazing considering there are only 2 speakers in the 555 set. I could hear footsteps behind me and spin around before they came around the corner, In Insurgent Camp I could be typing on the upstairs pc and distinctly hear people in the radio room or in the garage.Even though they aren't designed for gaming they play the part better than any of those under $100 gaming headsets you find in most stores."
4,Very good headphones,I have had the HD555 now for a month and they are really great! THe sound quality is great but sometimes you wish there was a little more bass. if you listen to a lot of bass heavy music then i would not get these due to the open concept that these are. I wear glasses and you dont even notice that headphones are even on. they do not jam your glasses into your head.Not much else to say that the other reviewers have not covered.
3,Excellent Headphones,"Bad plug. Most headphones and players have the small sized plugs. This unit has the large plug. There is a large to small adapter, but it is large and heavy. The adapter usually pulls the plug out of the hole if there is any movement at all.Good quality headphones."
3,Great for casual listener,"I did a DIY mod on this can to allow more open sounding. After its done I felt that the product was really worth too much for its price. Great can but if you are looking for a proper can for music, i wouldn't suggest.The bass on this can was not the best. It is not like they were muddy but it is just lacking of impact. The mid and highs were better then average and the low was just about decent. Annoying thing about this headphone was the wire being too long and the built was very ""plasticky"", feels very toy-like. But when you put it on, everything else does not seems to matters as the comfort level was really good."
5,Excellent sound quality at an affordable price,"There are some things you should know about this product before buying.1. It does not have active noise canceling2. The padding is made of some felt-like material and it attracts a lot of dust.3. It comes with one of those large audio jacks and uses an adapter to connect to regular headphone jacks: this is fairly bulky.4. The music you play will be audible to those around you5. They are big, so they aren't for travel.If none of those points bother you then this will be the perfect combination of sound quality and affordability. It is super comfortable and I could wear it for hours with no aches or pains. Also the wire is thick so you don't have to worry about it breaking or tearing. All the cons I mentioned pale in comparison to the features of this product."
4,Pleased with some reservations,"The sound quality with these headphone is amazing, though I am not an expert. You can hear surrounding sounds, if that's a concern for you.I have two things that are not quite to my liking - the headphones fit a little too snugly, the grip is a little aggressive. I found that if I adjusted them slightly further back on my ears that it's more comfortable. The other issue is the plug. It's a large size, and I'm using a Sony Blue Walkman player and the size of the plug makes the connection a bit unstable."
2,Broke my iPhone,"These are good headphones, but they are not meant to be on-the-go headphones for mp3 players. They are great if you are doing something stationary like sitting at a computer. However, the cable is much too long to be practical for on the go, and the headphone jack connector is humungous. It comes with a converter to be able to hook into an mp3 player (such as an iPhone), but this was still not that practical as it made the headphone jack connector stand about 4 inches above my iPhone with little room for the end of the cable to bend. The amount of tension caused over time by the non-bending hook-up bent the inside of my iPhone. Basically, the headphones broke my iPhone."
2,Good Quality headphones,"Well, the headphones are very high quality. They fit snugly but comfortably. The only complaint is they are very loud for those around you. I like to play the headphones with the volume up, but that really isn't possible on a bus. Otherwise, impressive quality sound!"
2,Not for airplanes,"Sound quality is fine, but the ""piggyback"" plug-in was a real problem for me on a recent air trip.With the unit plugged into the jack on a recent United flight (with a mini-pin receiver in the armrest), the plugs protruded more than 3 1/2"". When I, or a seatmate, tried to get to the aisle, they inevitably hit the plug, and it ultimatley became bent and inoperable.Hopefully, Sennheiser will replace the plug for me. But I'll make the HD555 my ""home"" headphones, and go back to my Bose for travel."
2,Headphones so everyone else can hear what you are listening to,"I feel like all the positive reviews are missing something; basically, everyone in the room can hear what you are listening to. I bought these as a Christmas present for my son; and would have returned them, but by the time he opened them and tried them out, we were beyond the 30 days for making returns. So, I let him buy some skull candy head phones that he really likes. And I use these. They are comfortable (thus the 2 star rating). But no matter how loud you are playing your music, everyone else can hear it too. It is almost as if they have speakers pointing out, as well as pointing in. Pass on these, unless you live alone and don't plan on listening with other people around."
2,too much sound bleeds out,These were light and good sound - but open back means lots of sound bleeding out from the phones - so bad for any situation where you need quiet outside the headphones.
2,Velvet headphones? These are not good.,The outside of these headphones are awful. Cheaper Sen headphones are much better. Don't waste your money. The don't provide cushion to your ears and have 0 bass.
3,Not for use on An Airplane,"I like the look and feel of the headphones, but I intended to use My new headphones to block out all the noise on the plane. And I feel they would work just fine for that except for the fact that you can hear whatever I'm listening to outside the headphones, which defeats the purpose. It would upset everyone around me because you can hear everything perfectly clear siting next to me or anywhere around me. Other then that fact, they work and sound great"
4,"Not for the ""base"" heads","Just a quick one from me. I own both this pair and the cheaper also excellent HD485. Just a word of warning on the HD555. If you like me enjoy the ""bottom end"" sound of music, perhaps are or were in to dance music in it's many forms, enjoy the sound of the base, perhaps spent a lot of time in dance-clubs as a youth listening to anything from deep house music through to reggae, jungle, drum and bass, etc then these are not for you in my humble opinion. For classical music, guitar, vocal, folk, rock these are wonderful and have great high end clarity. If you want to hear the warmth of the bottom end save a few dollars or pounds or euros and go for the 485."
4,"Amazing Sound Quality, But Impractical For Mobile Use","I owned these headphones and was thoroughly blown away by the clarity of the music. Personally, the sound was much more ""true"" than can be heard in any other brand such as Bose, Beats, Sony, or Shure. I felt as if I were in a studio listening to the music. Very great experience.Please understand that these open, dynamic headphones allow you to enjoy the music and also everyone else around you. I actually got complaints that everyone else could hear my music clearly. It didn't matter how loud I had the music, the sound resonated to those around me.A con to me was the stereo jack and the headphone adapter. I hated that I had to have an adapter just to plug the headphones into my computer or mp3 device. The stereo jack should not have been the primary jack, but the adapter.Since I personally did not care for everyone else listening to my music and the annoying stereo jack, I have decided to switch to the Sennheiser HD448 Closed headphones."
5,Amazing,"I couldn't be happier. I'd like a braided cord but it doesn't affect the product very much. Shipped very fast, works perfectly."
3,The Details are worse than expected,"When I got this product, I was really happy, since I had a 5 year old Sennheiser PX 100 white which still works good.But after I open the box, and get out the HD555, it's detailed places are really disappointing. the ear puds and the working surround it are really looks and feels chippy. It's all about those painted plastic with uncomfortable look.Then I connected to the desktop to try the sound. Honestly, the sound is good, but up till now, I didn't find any different performance to use PX 100 and this newly HD555. Maybe it needs more time to burn in.BTW, the 5 year old PX100 was made in Germany, and this new one, sorry to tell the others, it's made in China. Now I know the theory that we get what we paid."
4,Catholic School Girls,this book is a wonderful look at childhood and the past but I would not recomed it for young children do to it's talk about puberty
2,Limited coverage of an interesting topic,"This book is a diary written by a Scottish nurse who volunteered in Serbia during World War I. Unfortunately, the diary entries are sparse and there is not enough commentary or description. The best part of this book is the many photographs that are provided."
5,Graceful,"Like the ""Brown Album"" by The Band, MTB`s New Life is an album of uncompromising beauty. A combination of rural southern beauty, Americana, country blues, and their own brand of Jazz/ Rock fusion, this is, I believe, everything that The Marshall Tucker Band embodied. The title song is a beautiful tale of a person who having done his time dreaming of going home to a woman who always told him she would be there. There`s Blue Ridge Mountain Sky, sung with the feeling that can only come from living in a place where the skies are blue and life is slow and easy. There`s also good old rockers such Another Cruel Love and 24 Hours at a Time. A CD that will make you smile and shake your bottom."
5,great book for choosing between synonyms,No two words are perfect synonyms. They come from different origins; they evoke different emotional images. Professor/Senator Hayakawa provides excellent guidance on how to choose between similar words. I read an earlier version of this book with a different title.
5,Best book of word meanings and connotations.,"This title is exactly what I wanted. I was given a hardcover copy in 1969 and have used it endlessly since. At that time I had a severe stutter and my wonderful Mum said ""If you can't say a word then don't - choose another"". So she provided this book for me, which would have been expensive on their small budget. As a result I have developed a love of words and pride in knowing and choosing just the right word for what I want so say. If I'm not sure - then I know where to go - ""Choose the Right Word""."
5,More than a listing of synonyms,"As other reviewers have noted, this book goes further than merely listing synonyms for a given word. If you want to compare the connotations of 'elastic' and 'flexible,' or 'affix' and 'attach,' Choose the Right Word is the book for you.How I wish there was a software version! Highly recommended."
3,It could be much better,"This is not an easy book to write, because the modern art world has gone wild with multiple radical approaches to what used to be a relatively easy-to-understand subject. Thus I have no objection to a multply-authored text. And it is expected that some of the chapters will be better than others. OK.My objection is to the pictures. They are all in BLACK AND WHITE! This, in a field where the impact of color is so important! Almost as bad is the fact that all the pictures are bunched at the back, so, each time a picture is cited in the text, you have to go to the back to find this. And many are too small.I would have expected better from such an experienced art history publisher"
3,Not that easy to read,"This book gives you a dynamic look at the movements of the 20th century. Some of the entries are a bit lacking and stale. The transition between different writing styles proved unfavorable, but the book is useful as reference. I do not recamend it as an introduction to modern art. It focuses more on the events that shaped movements as opposed to the idealogy of them. If you are already familiar with modern art, this book will prove useful in building on a foundation of knowlage. I found ""The 20th century Art Book"" useful in reading this book. It helps compensate for the black and white pictures."
5,What better gift to give another or to oneself.,This is my second year using this calendar in my office. The pictures of His Holiness just help each day go by with grace and awareness. What better inspiration. I just wish they hadn't sold out.
1,wrong product,I specifically ordered AT&T batteries. Some other brand was sent so I returned the items.
3,How do you rate a battery?,It's a battery... They either work for awhile and then you buy more. This one worked just fine. Use land line phones for business and have an array of them in my home. The battery life per phone doesn't last long so it's important to have a secondary handset close by&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.
4,does what it needs to,battery was sized correctly and fit perfectly. I would recommend this battery over some over the other companies that make the same battery. Good life so far and should last a couple of years.
3,should have changed the name,"/received the battery timely, vendor did ship well, and, of course, the battery works and does what batteries do. The low rating on this is because it was NOT the same AT&T; battery that ships with the handset and full system sets.Maybe it was better. It was a Panasonic, but the point here is that if a ""similar"" item is being shipped, one should be made aware of that and not shown a picture of the original item."
5,Exactly as described from Home Theatre 24,I ordered these from Home Theatre 24 and they shipped actual AT&T; brand batteries in original packaging. Their shipping was quick and their package provided good protection of contents. Price with shipping was as good as any of the other vendors. Highly recommended.Update: One of the batteries was DOA (Dead on Arrival) and would not take a charge. I notified Home Theatre 24 and they immediately shipped out a replacement and I do not need to send back the defective battery. EXCELLENT customer service!
1,Eh ...,"Too short. Too expensive. Too limited in scope. Felt like a serious rip-off. Very, very disappointed."
5,Spark plug wires for 1996 Dodge Caravan with 3.3L V-6,This set of spark plug wires was a perfect replacement for the OEM harness on the 3.3L V-6 in a 1996 Dodge Caravan with 129K miles on it. The engine idles and runs much smoother now.
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","This pillow lacks considerably. I am an ultra optimistic person but I can't find any good things to say about this pillow. I constantly need to re-fluff this pillow from its pancake flatness...it is ridiculous! And the feathers keep poking out of the pillow, my pillow case and into my head :) I laugh only because it is a funny mind picture. I expected 'extra firm' and received 'extra flat'. Have I said enough?"
3,Puts Anyone's Scrabble Addiction into Perspective,"Scrabble nerds worthy of the designation will be entertained by this little documentary, while people who wonder what level of obsession it takes to become one will be thoroughly educated. The filmmakers acknowledge that they based their work on Stefan Fatsis's book Word Freak; indeed, they follow pretty much the same cast of characters. This might not be a feel-good movie for people who are into the game for mere fun and enjoyment."
5,GREAT,"If you've ever played competitive Scrabble in any form, and want to see the extent to which players commit themselves to this game, check this out!"
1,Filthy,"I watched this with my parents and didn't like Marlons mouth. Reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something. He cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far. What is cool about that? That whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school AND my neighborhood. The rest of the movie was all right but Marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity. Sorry, that's just my opinion."
2,enlightening,"This is a good film about an obsession shared by many, appreciated by few. I agree with previous reviewer that Marlon's foul-mouthed, pot-smoking, rude behavior was the downfall of the movie, hence the low rating. Low rating because the producers probably knew of his proclivities beforehand and chose him over a dozen others, thinking he would add color and interest. What he added was disgust and limited appeal. I eventually ended up muting his parts.Overall, however, this is a well done movie with nice graphics and filming. Next time, insert someone articulate instead of MH. Would love to have seen more of Nigel."
3,Kinda scary,"I enjoy Scrabble, but the people in this docu are scary. They're unemployed Scrabble players who are as neurotic as any character out of a Woody Allen movie. The docu looses a little steams as it goes on (watching Scrabble isnt that interesting), but it's an interesting look at professional Scrabble players."
1,Word Wars? Try Plethora of Profanity,"Honestly, I thought this would be a fun documentary that even my young daughter could watch. Wrong! This documentary follows 4 Scrabble players around in their quest to be the best at Scrabble. It should have been an interesting movie, but instead because one of the men chosen was a fount of never ending profanity, it wasn't watchable. Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of others using some ""unbleeped"" profanity as well, but this man was the worst offender. I find it ironic that this man who is evidently articulate and quite intelligent in his Scrabble playing could not seem to find any better words to use than those found on the list of those 10 words you cannot say on television. Too bad he could and did say them repeatedly in this documentary."
2,Meditating the Word,I was disappointed at the selection of texts that seems to reflect the editors theology rather than Bonhoeffer's.
5,Handy dandy tool,Handy little book with simple and quick explanations of the rules of golf. With diagrams and notes to further help the explanation you can't go wrong with this tiny little gem.
5,Little Mermaid,"My granddaughters loved this vanity. They told me, ""anything with Ariel is ok to buy, Grams""."
3,Sateen Sheets,"The sheet quality is very nice. Look great and feel nice. The only drawback is the fitted sheet. It has a elastic piece that goes around it and that holds it in place. I have a very thick mattress and it took quite a bit of manuevering to get the fitted sheet on properly. I would want to buy a fitted sheet that was easier to put on. Other than that, the sheets are great."
1,I want the old books back,"Dear Readers,The bookscool. Its cool. But why did they have to brake up they looked good together. I hope Mel and Kev get back togther. And why do they have to spell Mum ""MOM"" couldnt they spell it ""MUM"" it woulod be aloit better. I hate Aaron. He remides me of a kid who went to my Primary School. I hope star wins the Darby. But he dosnt. Image dose. I like Hi jinks. But on the book when Jinks comes out they spell his name like High Jinks when it should be Hi Jinks. What happened to Sterling Dream. Whernt they going to breed her to Jazzman. And why is Jazzman so Popual if Glory was the one to win all those races why didnt he go into the darby.Where are the rest of the gang.(...)"
3,Little Boring by Horsegal,This book like the rest of Christina's books was a little boring.No excitement at all.Chris is turning into a brat.She always has to have everything her way.But still I guess it's OK.HAPPY READING.Your going to need it.
2,Can we get back to the picture?,"Please, yes I give props to the new writer, it is a good book but not within the Thoroughbred series. I've been an avid reader since the books came out, that was nearly 10 years ago. I love the series and I don't intend to stop reading them but the direction they have gone is somewhat disapointing. Changing writers and story lines can get confusing enough but then they don't have the decency to get the facts right stated clearly in the series. Character flaws come inot also, where did some characters go? Who are these new ones? And the horses are my favorite characters of course but some of the new developments are so worn out and done so often I can decide what horse is what. I'm not trying to dis the series or anything but I do hope that my review has sparked someone else to take charge in publishing of the series and hopefully get the series back on track."
4,Great start for Jennifer Chu!,"Distance Runner is a great book! The plot is good and exciting. You can hardly notice that they got another author. But I don't see how Ashleigh would just let Christina go to somewhere she doesn't know a thing about and placed in the hands of people she never met. It's unrealistic. And also if Callie is a sprinter why did Amanda and Patrick put her in such a long race? But overall, I think this was a great book and I can't believe Jennifer Chu read these books when she was twelve! Thoroughbred hasn't been around for generations has it?"
4,"Pretty good, but not the best","I finished the book, but I wasn't waiting for a time when I could. I didn't like how Christina wrote an email about how Melanie probably had been dreaming about the Derby as long as she had, Melanie had been longer! Years longer! I wish theye'd leave out some of the stuff about Star needing Christinas help when he was born....... Star getting sick.......... Star and Christina going to Montana......... and ""The horse every ones going to be talking about is Wonders Star"". I also wish Christina hadn't become a jockey."
2,Dont Kill Parker!,"This book would have been soooo much better if Parker didn't just like..suddenly drop off the face of the earth. thats STUPID, STUPID, STUPID that they arent together! they were perfect! im really mad about it. ditch aaron. its ok if they are friends but pleeeaaase dont make them anything more and make parker and chris get back together.the books were better that way."
1,OSN Digital clamp-on tripod,"The idea is great, but it doesn't fit the standard water bottle neck. It's made for something much larger and I haven't figured out what that is... Maybe something in Europe? Who knows.... crazy thing..."
1,very disappointing,"while i never expected Caligula, the description led me to believe some (simulated) sex would be taking place; i kept waiting, and waiting, but it never came (ALL puns intended). that might not have been the death blow, except the movie makes NO SENSE AT ALL, without any naked people, and dry humpin'.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! really, you would be better off picking your nose, while jerking off, to your grandmother's old Sears catalogues. seriously--i'm considering suicide, because i am not forgetting this nightmare quickly enough."
1,not righy,loved it couldnt stop watching it had a blast with it an i loved furzz if that is how to spell his name
4,Recommended read,"As a pilot, I enjoyed this aviation experience. The starship seems the perfect magic carpet vehicle for the dream that many of us share - round-the-world on your terms, at your own pace, and by your own hand."
2,Doesn't really work,"I'm also with the reviewer who said it doesn't work as fiction or a travelogue. I bought this book with the understanding that it was a work of fiction. I'm a big fan of the Beechcraft Starship and purchased the book just because of that. I duplicated the flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator and found that there are many errors in the flight plans. As a work of fiction, it's not compelling (not much happens) and as a travelogue, it's not very accurate in a number of cases, as others have stated."
2,Lost their edge...,"Perhaps a bit more technically capable than their last release (Odds Against Tomorrow), but the raw energy and youthful exuberance of the once really good band with lots of potential has been traded in for the sake of playing it safe. Suppose that's what growing old is all about, but still wish they would take a few more chances."
1,Totally Disappointed,"This book is too basic. It gives no information on the product other than screen shots and instructions on point here and click. I would not recommend this book for a technical person at all. In the areas that it does attempt to get into some useful information (i.e. data warehousing) the approach was out of left field and suddenly it became very complex. I ran into problems with some of the pointing and clicking, but had no explanation on how to deal with them. I cannot suggest this book for anyone. I would have rated it zero stars, but this format does not give that option. I would say a refund is in order."
2,Okay as a quickstart guide,"While I had some SQL education way back in college, I needed to quickly get up to speed with SQL Server 7.As a technical user it left me disappointed with the lack of depth, but I would still have been disappointed if I were less experienced - a large amount of information in the beginning chapters is slightly incorrect, or the screenshots don't match the text (presumably the book was written against a pre-release version of SQL Server 7).Try another book, no matter what your experience level is."
4,Requiem Review,"I thought this was a phenomenal piece of work by artist such as Simon LeBon,John Taylor,Susannah Hoffs,Toni Childs,John Waite,Johnathan Elias and front man for YES,Jon Anderson.Songs like ""Follow In My Footsteps"" and I've Not Forgotten You"" are very eclectic and stick with you over and over.It had been over 19 years since I heard the album again and have been searching for it everywhere.I went to so many record stores while serving overseas and in the states looking for it but was always told it was out of print.Found it on here,bought it and popped it in and right off the bat,after almost 20 years,still remembered word for word every song.I suggest if your in the mood for something not rushed and very relaxing,pick it up and you won't be disappointed."
4,Very good,"This is not a well known album, however the closest music I have heard, which compares to this album and worth listening to is:Vangelis: Blade Runner 5 starsVangelis: El Greco 5 starsVangelis: Voices 5 starsIf you are into this specific music and Genre, this album is for you"
2,The Whole World Is Coming?,"This album is a collection of well known musicians including Jon Anderson (Yes) who sings on two tracks. Unfortunately, one of the songs has two parts and Michael Bolton ""sings"" part two, which is not indexed for your CD player to skip. Jim Morrison's voice is featured, reading poems similar to his ""An American Prayer"" (great album!). If you like native American chanting and drumming between tracks of songs and poems sung and read by different performers, you might like this. It is a sincere and respectful tribute to the native Americans. The last words on the album are read by Martin Sheen... ""the whole world is coming"". I doubt it, and certainly not listening to this. For Anderson completests, you get about 12 minutes of his voice, thus the two star rating."
2,Meh....,"I bought this for the Simon LeBon tune and Jim Morrison poetry. It's okay. I've listened to it a couple of times, but I doubt it sees many (if any) more trips to the CD player."
4,Very nice zoom telephoto lens,"I bought this lens in order to do some bird photography and I am very pleased with the results. I had read reviews of other zoom telephoto lenses that said you needed to aware of possible vignetteing with the lens. I have had no problem with this lens. The operation of the lens is smooth and easy to focus manually. The weight of the lens is something for me to get use to, but this is the first long range lens I have owned.I purchased the lens through Amazon which made the process simple. If any of you have tried to deal with camera warehouses you know that speed is not always a high priority. 1 - 2 weeks is not a long wait (I got my lens in about 10 days). Plus the assurance of Amazon also helps."
3,"Problems with heel, not as good as comparable Rockports","These shoes were not as comfortable or durable as comparably priced Rockports. Like a few other reviewers, I also had a problem with heel wear as the edge of the heel quickly wore down exposing a particle-board type interior. There is about 1/16"" of rubber on the bottom of the heel, but the sides of the heel are basically particle board that has been painted black.The other down side of the wooden heel is that the shoes are indeed loud, especially if you wear through the thin rubber sole on the edge where your heel first makes contact with the ground. My wife was always worried that I would wake up the kids in the morning with my foot steps in these shoes (and only these shoes), even when I made a point of walking lightly.On the positive side, they look decent (until the heel wears) and they're cheap. However I'm going back to Rockport for my next work shoe."
5,A good shoe at a good price,These shoes are great. It only took a day or two to break them in. They look and feel great. I highly suggest them to anyone!
1,poor quality shoe,"The shoes were very poor quality - the exterior finish began to flake off after about 2 hours of wear. I'm not sure the product was even real leather as it was supposed to be. I do not recommend buying this shoe. I've owned many pairs of Bostonian shoes over the last 15 years, but the pair I purchased here was not the same. I was extremely disappointed."
2,looks good but uncomfortable,"bought this because of the good review and looks. had it now for about 2 weeks and I find them uncomfortable to wear. I walk more than 2 km each day in these shoes, but it press painfully on top of my big toe. I tried wearing thicker socks and putting band-aids on top of the big toes but the result is the same. i cannot recommend these shoes."
2,"Poor choice, heels are lousy","Initially I was happy with these shoes. But, the heels quickly began to wear. The heel consists of a block of wood, with a thin, thin layer of rubber over it. Once the rubber begins to wear where the heel strikes (which happened for me in the first four months), the wood make the shoes very loud to walk in. And the more it wears, the worse the problem becomes. People in the office joked that they knew who was coming - namely me - because the sound was unmistakable. I won't be buying another pair of these."
2,Eh,"The material seems too shiny, almost like a patent leather shoe. Not to mention the shoes are ridiculously uncomfortable– I walked maybe a mile in them and had horrible blisters. Would not recommend."
4,"Beautiful, but...","My husband was pleased with the look and fit of these shoes, but wants to make it known that they are misleading by advertising these shoes as all leather. THE SOLES ARE MANMADE. If this makes a difference to you, take note. If not they are beautiful and time will tell if the soles wear well. They are worth the price, but docked one star for manmade soles issue."
2,"Lather sole , Hard flat heels","These shoes have thin lather (~3/8 inch) sole. You can also zoom in the image and see the threads to bind the sole with its top. Once the lather teared off ~1/16 inch, these threads will tear off too.Another drawback I found is its heel are too hard, just like a wood, they sounds when you steps on the floor (some people may like it). Heal have flat bottom, it should be little curved from the rear end. Being a flat and hard heel they will make you walk like a girl atleast for 2-3 days until they are curved by themselves.Good part is these have excellent shinning top and they looks very good.Above review is written after 3 week experience. Will update the review after about 6 months if I found them on my shoe rack."
1,Not real leather?,"I had not worn these Bostonian Akron's for more than an hour when the shiny paint on the surface of the leather (?) just flaked right off. It flaked off along the bend line right behind the cap toe. You might say that this was just a bad lot and the finish wasn't applied right or this pair stayed on the shelf/warehouse too long, but those excuses would miss the point = why on earth would I buy leather shoes that are maybe leather with a layer of paint substance covering the entire shoe. They looked like cheap plastic shoes (and I am military so I understand chorpham or pattent leather shoes, but these are different/cheaper/faker). I do not recommend buying the Bostonian Akron."
2,Description isn't complete,"I did not read anywhere in this information that the Akron had a rubber sole. After receiving it today, and feeling somewhat cheated, I went to decriptions on other sites where that is explained. I have to rationalize that for the price, I got a good shoe, but I have bought Bostonians for many years and have always had leather soles. This came as quite a disappointing surprize.I did order them from Papa Shoes and was very pleased with them. Ordered on the 6th and just received on the 11th. Cannot beat that."
1,Disappointed,"Without a doubt, these shoes are absolutely the most uncomfortable I have ever tried to wear. I've got primarily a desk job and I've been wearing them once a week to break them in. Every single time, I end up with blisters and can't wear them the rest of the week."
4,Classic leather sole shoe,I owned Bostonian Akron in the past and they served me well. This is the same model. The leather looks as good as before. I am pleased with the product delivered.The seller sent the shoes promptly with no problems. A pleasant experience.
4,Good Bostonian Men's Akron Shoes,"Good pair of shoes, reached in time and nice to wear them. Excellent dress shoes. Get just a bit warm in summers for hotter regions."
5,These are real nice shoes,"I recommend these shoes. They are comfortable and sleek. So far the soles are lasting a while with heavy wear. The price is a little steep. You could settle for the Payless knock-off versions, but you would certainly tell the difference!"
2,Nice Looking but PAINFUL,"My colleague and I by total chance bought this same shoe within days of each other. The shoes have caused us tremendous pain and bleeding in the area of our heels. I have never purchased a pair of shoes that was so difficult to break in. Nearly 2 weeks after purchasing them, I am still wearing a pair of athletic socks under my dress socks to minimize the discomfort of this nice looking but brutally painful footwear. The first few days, I even wrapped my feet with athletic tape to reduce the rubbing, friction and bleeding. Next time I'll go with Rockports or Johnson and Murphys."
1,Don't buy it- try Ebsco Host,This was on the required book list for class so I bought it. I felt extremely stupid later when I figured out that the entire thing was available through the library's online service. It probably is at your school as well.
2,Terrible,This album makes you give a negative rate no matter what. It must be the worst record they have ever released. Strict only to Venom Fan collectors. If you are new try Black Metal (album)
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I've thought for years that I would like to find a Bible that was as close to the Greek as possible, a Bible that I could read with confidence that important messages weren't lost or changed in the translation. I'm happy to have found this translation that includes the Greek, an original translation and the King James translation, on every page. I would definitely recommend this Bible."
3,debunking only half the story,"It's rather easy to show, as Anderson does, that some of Ravenscroft's claims are simply incredible. But it's also easy to show, as do several other books much more credible than Ravenscroft's Spear, that Hitler was certainly interested in theory of the occult, while not himself being a committed occultist in practice. This is not uncommon among highly intelligent but somewhat emotionally deranged persons. It's also rather hard to deny, when one reads the words of the man himself, in Mein Kampf and in Rauschning's non verbatim record of conversations, that Hitler was fascinated and influenced by concepts and beliefs which are identifiable with occult theory of history and race, and which can be traced from Blavatsky to Gurdjieff to Crowley. But he was not a follower, but a leader, not a theorist but a pragmatist, and his use and abuse of such ideas was peculiarly his own. No one however can claim that he was original in inspiration."
3,My Own Country,"I liked the Author's style of writing. Loved his ""Cutting for Stone,"" but this was less of a true story, and was extremely graphic."
3,not as good as the second memoir but still good.,Realisticallly portrays the impact of AIDS on a small towen in the 80s...shows Dr Verghese's incredible skill as a physician and well worth reading.
5,My Own Country,"Have read Abraham Verghese's novel Cutting for Stone and so enjoyed the read. Amazon suggested My Own Country by the same author. What was interesting was that Dr. Verghese moved to the smoky mountains of Tennessewe in the 80's to work at a local hospital. His specialty is infectious disease. The doctor loves the area and its people, feeling that it is a good place to raise a family. Also one of the first Aids case appears. Wonderful follow up to his first book."
1,"a lousy, self-referential book",What a lousy book! Verghese seems far more enamored with himself and his pen than the people he is supposed to treat. Yeccchh!
5,Couldn't put this book down!,"After being introduced to Verghese with the EXCELLENT book ""Cutting for Stone"" I promptly bought his other two books. My Own Country: A Doctor's Story is very well written and once you start it, it grabs you and you won't want to put it down! Not only is it a fascinating true story of the beginning of the Aids epidemic in ""small town America"", it is also a very insightful look into what ""foreign tranined"" doctors have to go through to become successful doctors in the United States. I wish that Dr. Verghese was my doctor! I highly recommend this book! And this author!"
4,Eye opening reminder,"After reading Cutting for Stone I was compelled to read something else by this author. My Own Country is his own account of his experiences during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Written without 'icing' but without maudlin sentiment, he recounts the perception of the beginning of awareness of the disease and the effects on him as a doctor and a human being.This is a good read, and for those who have lived through this period, a reminder of what those days could be like. For those too young to remember when AIDS was a stigma as well as a death sentence this book provides some background as to what has been and could very well be again."
3,"Not as good as ""Cutting for Stone"" or ""The Tennis Partner""","I LOVED ""Cutting for Stone""and really liked ""The Tennis Partner"" but ""My Own Country"" isn't as compelling. It was still very good - I especially enjoyed the insight into a physician's impression of the American medical system. The other two books I mentioned I flew through - had a hard time putting them down, and was drawn into them - this one reads a bit slower."
2,A disappointing exercise in egocentrism.,"Having enjoyed some of Verghese's essays, I looked forward to My Own Country. But I was disappointed by the clumsy writing and the lack of cohesiveness. And I was irritated by his persistent focus on his own feelings while faced with the tragic stories of his patients. So often in the book, he relates some terrible anecdote and then goes on to say how it reminds him of his own situation--which, of course, is utterly absurd. The value of the book lies in the stories of the AIDS patients, and I'm left wishing that Verghese had made this book more of a ""patients' story"" than a ""doctor's story."""
3,A Doctor's Love for his Patients,"This based-on the author's true-story details the time he was just starting out as a doctor. He picked a Hospital in smalltown United States where he would be the infectious disease specialist. Suddenly, cases of AIDS appeared even in that small town. It was the 80's epidemic and as it spread from the big cities AIDS victims were met with fear and a lack of compassion from most doctors. Verghese was one of the few who truly listened to and cared for his patients through such a terrible disease."
2,Reflections on Mortality,"Verghese's journey through his early medical career in Tennessee ripples with his struggle for self-knowledge, a growing awareness of his vocation as an infectious disease specialist, and a deep, abiding love of nature. His humanity shines through in every patient he meets, and we come to love them all as colorful formats of human beings. His detailed description of the rolling mountains of Tennessee helps to convey why he came to call a place his home--and the people there, his people."
4,Review for My Own Country,"It was delivered very quickly, which I was pleased about. However, there was a small blood-like stain on the book, which I wish I knew about before purchasing."
5,Needs to be read by everyone,"Having lost a son to AIDS and living in the South, I wondered about other cases and how the other patients had died. This book puts faces on AIDS cases and makes me better understand what I went through. My son died in a big city and his suffering was probably less than the ones who had to come home to die. An excellent book that should be read by everyone."
4,"A Look at AIDS, small towns, and an Indian doctor in America","The author manages to weave the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, life in a small southern town, the struggle of a foreign doctor to succeed in America, and his marriage into one book. Perhaps this is it's only fault.The most compelling plot line places Dr. Verghese on the front lines of a ""strange,"" killer disease that has made it's way to a conservative small town. His dedication to the unlikely AIDS patients, and how this impacts his life, makes you wish your job held more meaning. You root for the doctor and his patients, and your heart is warmed by the acceptance he receives from town residents who you'd expect might react differently.Since the book's publication, Dr. Verghese has been interviewed on prime-time television news shows regarding foreign doctors and their struggles in America. This story is told on the edges of the book, but you can see the beginning of his crusade in the book."
3,so-so book,"This book wasn't a bad read, but it wasn't as good as some of the other Dinotopia books. Loro, Ria, and Trentor just spent a lot of time running away from things and it started to get a little boring after a while."
1,Does not work at all,"I just got this product, and it does not work at all. I thought it just was not hot enough, so I let it sit to heat up for ten minutes, but the plates are cool enough that I can touch them with my hand. My hair is not that curly in the first place, but even after attempting to straighten my hair for twenty minutes, it remains wavy. If I could give this product zero stars, I would."
3,take this play with a grain of salt,"im not sure where i stand on the authorship of this play just yet, especially in an age which happily shuns the two noble kinsmen entirely. I would say this is worth a look if you're a scholar, but beginners need not take it as shakespearean cannon. the inclusion of edward III into shakespeare's corpus is a little hasty here."
1,AWFUL!!,"Do not waste your money on this. Mine rusted within a week. It literally fell apart after 4 months. The spark arrester fell of. This is flimsy at best. It is a very nice looking unit, but that's it. I had Whalens pit for 6 years. I replaced the screen once. I miss that thing. I gave it to someone who still uses it."
2,Nice looking...but flimsy.,"Title says it all. It's also seventy bucks cheaper at Walmart, but still isn't worth the money."
2,Beautiful - but rusted into junk,I received this as a gift and it was one of the nices fireplaces I had seen. unfortunately It should be put indoors after each uses - I did not do that and it quickly rusted and fell apart - very nice appearance initially but didnt last - ended up throwing it out. :(
5,I LOVE it !,"This is the best tool purchase I've made in years.So far it will split anything I've tossed at it effortlessly....and that includes Black Oak ...further, it assembled in minutes, starts easily, and is very well constructed and USA made. It is light weight and easily can be moved or set up stationary. It is truly an amazing machine.It is also sold on the web under the brand ""Iron and Oak""....same machine.Shop around the net for pricing...I paid $835 delivered to the door."
5,Wondeful Book for Chruch Leaders,This book is a must for church leaders. It gives great insights to lay leaders and pastors alike. I will definitely be reading this book again!
2,A waste of money,There's not a lot out there for baritone ukuleles so I thought I'd buy this book and DVD. I'm sorry I wasted money on it. There's much better free information available on the Internet.
4,good book,This book is very informative and helpful but wish it had the tabs along with the notes which would help learn the notes easier and faster.
3,Another Mel Bay Book,"This is just another ""typical"" Mel Bay book. The material and content ranges from good to very good, but; the presentation is DRY, DRY, DRY. It helps to know about the dry presentation in advance because, with persistance on the student's part, there is valuable knowledge to be learned. I had hoped for a little more background and historical information about the Baritone Uke than was presented."
4,"Good, but could have been better","Great book with a great insight into Schuey's life (also privat life), but for me it is too much of a picture book rather than a 'serious' biography of a racing driver. Maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred a more informative autobiography about how he has seen his racing career so far and certain situations. I dream of a Schuey autobiography in which he goes through all of his races, his entire career.I hope we will get one in the future..."
4,Schumacher: the official inside story,Book is great and in great shape. My son was just very disappointed that it was only 70 pages of text and the rest is photos. So he was unable to read this for his school report.
4,"Camiel, the next thing in chill jazz","Another artist I have heard on my local smooth jazz station, I am fond of Camiel's neo-Brazilian tune ""El Alba"". The rest of the tracks have electronic effects to liven up the tunes, but it is Camiel's guitar works that interests me."
2,"Good beginner text, but way too expensive","I was dissapointed in this book. There are a number of ""Beginner"" texts out there for Java that cover most of the topics addressed by this book, at a signficantly lower price. I already know Java, and was looking for a good crash course on the Jbuilder environment. What I got was way more tailored to the beginning Java programmer, and not nearly enough to how to use Jbuilder."
2,where's the beef?,"I am a computer science student and have programmed in numerous languages including BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, HP SPL, C, and DELPHI (PASCAL). The course I am following based on this text is my first exposure to Java and Borland's JBuilder. While the text provides many sample programs, the applications are very specific and rather contrived. If you are an experienced programmer new to Java, you will find this text to be a poor reference. The skills most important to getting started with JBuilder, creating a new project and managing the files, are dealt with very summarily and may end up causing you hours of frustration. If you're planning to learn at home, I suggest searching a bit further before settling for this book."
3,Good college CS book,I believe that this is a good Java book. I am not a beginner programmer so i can not comment on the useability of it for the beginner but all in all it is a ok book.I find that the part of the book describing classes and how to create them worthless.I also found more errors in the book than I hoped to have found. Most of the errors were in the programming exercises at the end of a chapter. If there were in the chapter (how the code works...) then I wouldn't know since this was my only source of knowlede of Java other than the web.I believe that this book is a little over proced for the knowledge that it conveyed. But if it is required for you CS (Computer Science) course get the book and suplement it with http://java.sun.com . It has a wealth of knowledge. All of Java's core classes are described there and their usage.
1,Awful Introduction to Java Book,"This book is not an introduction book. If you have little or no programming experience, do not buy this book. Other than being overpriced, the author introduces topics that are way too advanced for the beginner. This book is probably better for individuals that have some background in programming. Save yourself the money and find another book. The author should really consider revising this book. I think he has lost touch with the readers of his text in calling it an ""Intro"" book. I found other books at 1/3 the price that was much better. Total waste of money!"
2,This is primarily a sales brochure,"This is primarily a sales brochure. While it does guide you through the steps to build a multi level train set, almost every stage is an illustration on how to use (buy) their products. Don't get me wrong, the basics are presented, but only far enough to sell what they want."
4,Good Value,"I used to have one of these many years ago and it finally ""wore out"". I took it backpacking, sailing, etc. and finally the elements took their toll. I immediately ordered another one.This binocular is lightweight for easy, one-hand operation, focuses quickly, has about the right magnification, and can fit in small spaces. I dont' mind that I look through it ""backwards"". When you think of all the money you COULD spend to get something similar (often two to three times the price) you might as well buy three of these just to have them on hand as spares.I am VERY happy with mine."
5,Finally on DVD! Grab it today!,"This horror anthology TV series was broadcast on ""live"" television, meaning it was never filmed. The episodes are preserved courtesy of a method known as ""kinescope"" so don't expect superb prints. No one has superb prints. But . . . the picture and sound quality is as good as it gets and thank goodness someone put them out. This is the first of three box sets containing the SUSPENESE TV series, and they have NEVER been available on VHS or DVD before. I do recommend you buy the book on SUSPENSE (also available on Amazon) as a companion piece and enjoy!"
4,A Blast from the Past,"Return to the early days of television when everything was live!! These DVDs, taken from kinescope recordings, do not have great picture quality. and some of the stories are pretty cornball to the more sophisticated audiences of today,but it is still great to see the old stars, and the early performances of young actors who later became stars."
1,"Sorry, a waste of money in every way...","Aside from the aesthetic value of having these shows from the days of old TV, the quality of the video is understandably not the best...but what could have been upgraded is the audio quality which is terrible, you have to strain to understand the dialogue...at the very least give it some high end EQ and tone down the bass...not hard to do.As for plot and acting, most episodes are flat, painfully boring, and downright stupid...with the exception a very few, the acting is awful.And then there's that background organ that makes it all the worse; it never stops and is louder than the dialogue at times."
3,Suspense,"This is tv in its beginning. I had forgotten mic shadows, line mistakes, and the like. I am enjoying the disc just for the people appearing in the shows. Many of them at the beginning of their careers. The picture quality isn't the best but passable watching. I reccomend the disc for anyone living thru the begining of television. Roger"
2,I Rather listen to the Radio Series,"Suspense is one of the Greatest Radio Shows in the history boardcasting.Outstanding writing with performances from many big name stars of 1940's.The Suspense TV series after viewing these 30 episodes for first time is a let down. It uses many of the same stories as the Radio series even some of same actors like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre.But I just don't get the same Thrill and tension while watching as I do listening.Radio, The Theater of the Mind is a more powerfull tool then what actuallycan be shown over the TV."
1,Bait and Switch,This is not the Century Bob that I had wanted. I feel that the seller sold a different product that which was presented. I wanted the XL and clicked on the least expensive one advertised and received the torso version. I will not purchase from this provider again. I advise those purchasing to beware of this bait and switch company.
3,mixed bag,"I admit it, BOB is a lot more fun than your average heavy bag. You can use him to practice those exotic strikes you learned at the dojo but never thought you could use without getting arrested. But, beware, my BOB was less than two years old before I literally began tearing his head off. A wide crack developed under his chin which now reaches all the way to the back of his neck. I don't think it will take too much more effort to behead him. Too bad because BOB isn't cheap. Back to conventional bags for me."
4,I LOVE this thing!,"If you like to work out and need to get out some aggression than this thing is perfect for you! I had to buy some gloves as it was hurting my hands to punch with bare hands. The only problem I have is that it is currently filled with water and on carpet it's just not heavy enough so ""Bob"" keeps trying to escape from me into the corner!It's great though...makes my workout more fun."
1,DO NOT BUY if you have Adaptec Easy-CD Creater installed,"After eagerly awaiting the arrival of my imagemate and the blazingly fast transfer speeds it offered, I suffered a huge hit when I tried to install the drivers. As soon as I plugged it in and it tried to load the drivers, my system locked up. Tried again, no luck. Finally I went to their site and realised that there is some sort of problem with Adaptec and Imagemate coexisting on the same machine. After unsuccesfully trying to use their suggested fixes, and unsuccesfully trying to get through to their support staff(over an hour on hold), I sent mine back and bought another brand that has worked great. Buyer Beware!"
1,Problems with Windows ME,"I've been trying for days to get the drive to work with my PIII-800 Windows ME machine. It's highly unstable, even after completely disabling (stop from loading) the Adaptec CD Write application. The drive is recognized less than 25% of the time, and constantly spits out error messages about removing the drive. Also, I can only copy a couple small <50k files - anything larger brings on the blue screen of death and a corrupt file on the CF card."
3,Windows 2000 installation NOT painless,"I have been pulling my hair out trying to install SDDR-31-01 under Win2K (SP2). The only thing that worked was to install the device using MS's generic driver. The instructions booklet is minimally helpful, with no troubleshooting info whatsoever. The sandisk website was not much better in helping with the installation. It's now apparently working, with the sandisk icon in the system tray and the device has been assigned a drive letter. The Windows 2000 installation is pitifully inadequate."
1,User Beware!,"Singularly, the worse and most unreliable computer product I've ever experienced! All I can say is that I followed installation directions for the SanDisk Compactflash Reader, and what happened next was a computer nightmare -- my computer went into an uncontrollable cycle of loading Windows 98 then restarting. What I had to do was reload Windows and all my programs -- an eight hour ordeal."
4,Good product easy to use,"I bought this reader to transfer files from my S300 to my computer. With WinME all i had to do was plug the device into the USB port. The system detected it and i was transfering files in not time. The transfer speed is pretty good. I would recommend if you are using Adobe CD creator to use the patch, so that the reader won't interfere with your CD burning abilities....just go ... to find the patch."
4,Works well with my Mac Cube,"It certainly downloads the images quickly. I do wish that I could run it through my USB hub instead of having to connect it directly to my Cube. Nice product for the price, though."
1,Imagemeate USB stops working,"After having this item installed and working on my computer for several months, one day the icon for it has disappeared. I tried to re-install it unsucessfully for several hours. I followed the sandisk technical support instructions for the problem identified as EZ-USB EEPROM missing (ezusb.sys)It was impossible for me to reinstall it sucessfully."
5,Great product,"This is a great product. It heats up faster than the factory heated seats in our Volvo, and has two heat settings (Hi and Lo) (which the Volvo doesn't). With a warm behind and back, I find that I'm happy with the interior of the car cooler. Keeping it in place can be a bit of a challenge if you drag yourself into the seat, but the retaining straps do a pretty good job. It is reasonably priced, and I was so impressed, I bought one for a friend, and have recommended it to others."
1,Short lived heating,Lasted less than a month before it stopped working. Would not recommend to anyone.
2,keeps puppies out... but,"I was very saddened by this purchase. I will admit upfront that I am a person that doesn`t have time, patience, or thew will to send things back, which means that i have a high standard for things I order online. This was one item that I decided I would just need to make work. It came broken- the joint to make the door swing open was broken right in half upon arrival. Nothing a little take and glue wouldn`t fix! Then i went to make it work in the doorway... now to be fair, i do think we have wider-than-average door frames, but once I used all /of the extenders that the gate came with, it fit, but doesn`t look great. I would not reccommend this product."
1,pet gate,Product was damaged when received.But I was able to return it without a hassle and received a full refund.I do have another Richell One Touch Gate and they are very nice gates. Disappointing thisone didn't work out.
5,Perfect!,This gate is just what we needed to keep our puppy out of the front room. Easy to install and looks great. We love it!
5,Attractive and functional,"We bought 2 of these gates so we can slowly start letting our puppy (a basset hound) have more freedom. It comes with enough extra parts that you can modify it to fit most doorways, but measure first to be sure yours isn't too small. My husband set it up so that our cats can fit through the side, but our dog cannot, which is great as far as getting them used to each other.You can open and close the door with one hand, and it swings both ways silently. If you are clumsy like me you will most likely be tripping over the bar on the bottom for a few days, but once you get used to it being there you won't even notice it.I love that it fits in with our decor and that unlike some other attractive gates, it doesn't have to be screwed into the walls. I definitely recommend this gate!"
4,Keeps the cat out,I like this gate. The color matches our stained wood trim so it doesn't look too obtrusive. Set up was easy and it works fine. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 becuase the handle is visual a bit unattractive but it works easily and correctly. We use this to keep our elderly cat out of a particular room. I'm going to buy another one for the other entrance into the room. We have a walk over gate there but find ourselves walking around to use this swing gate instead of stepping over the other gate.
5,Quality Product,"The extension panels on either side of the gate need to be configured differently for each of several ranges of width for the opening to be closed off. There are four configurations, as shown in the manual. I've also uploaded a photo of this to the user photos.The set-up wasn't especially difficult, but you certainly don't take the unit out of the box and put it to use straight-away.You'll want to have a tape measure (to measure the opening and choose the right configuration) and a 17mm open-ended wrench to tighten the extension panels (if used/needed).If your opening is not within one of these ranges the gate won't work so don't wast your money.The gate isn't cheap, but it's nice and heavy, well built and much nicer than then collapsing cheap ones at your local big-box store."
3,Life's Good Again!!!,"My 3 month old cocker spaniel kept climbing over the 2 foot metal gate I had across the laundry room door. I knew I needed a fence without horizontal bars. She was able to place her back paws on the bottom horizontal bar, her front paws on the top horizontal bar and jump over the gate.When I saw a fence similar to this fence I knew I was about to secure the right gate. No more climbing over the gate!! (her or me!!) However, in reading the reviews, I knew I did not want a wooden gate because one buyer said his dog chewed through the spokes in a few months, so I looked under metal gates and purchased this gate. Great gate, easy set up, easy to walk through. BUT THE SPOKES ARE WOOD, SO I HAD TO DUCT TAPE EACH SPOKE BECAUSE BOTH MY FEMALE COCKERS BEGAN CHEWING. Once I did that everything was fine!!THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LISTED UNDER METAL GATES."
4,Pet gate,Arrived quickly. Was fairly easy to set up and put into place. Directions were weak. Have had no problems since it was installed.
3,Be wary of your door frame width...,"My door frame is a little too big for this even though it met the specs. It leaves a gap just wide enough where I'm worried my dogs will get their head stuck between the bars and the door frame if they were so bold to do so (they are 14lb dogs).It's probably easiest to have a helping hand putting this together since we had to make several adjustments before being comfortable with the gap that it left. Otherwise, it's pretty sturdy once it's in. My dogs can jump up against it and it doesn't budge."
5,Sturdy and Easy to Operate with One Hand,"My pet gate arrived quickly and in good condition. It is a bit of a challenge to install, but once you figure it out, it is easy to move from one door way to another. Also, it is very sturdy and easy to operate with one hand while you are trying to corral an active puppy. Tall enough to use for an adult-size large breed dog.When it first arrived, I thought something was wrong with it because the frame was not square, but this is the way it is supposed to be. The frame squares up when it is installed and this allows it to have a secure fit.Lastly, it actually looks like a piece of furniture!"
5,Wood Pet Gate,"Excellent product at a good price. We have used it for almost 3 years now. It is still perfect. It is our 3rd pet gate, and the only one I would buy again."
4,"pet gate, pretty good","Overall this gate is very useful, and much better then the one I had before. With the old gate, I needed to climb over or remove it every time I wanted to pass through the doorway. This gate swings open both ways, and I can still close the bedroom door it is in front of as well. This gate also does its job keeping the dog where he needs to be.I do wish the handle were made of something sturdier than plastic, since I use it so often. I also wish that the handle was not an awkward safety handle- it's not as straight forward to open as ""one touch"" implies. Finally, it would be nice if the frame were completely made of wood for a nicer, uniform appearance- the surrounding part is metal and only the door part is wood. (and that handle is weird brown plastic)Overall, however, I am pleased with the gate and would recommend it."
2,My Brittany can open it!,"Several years ago, we bought three of these gates to confine our new puppy to only part of our house while we weren't home. They worked great. We subsequently moved and gave them to a friend who also had a good experience with them. We recently moved again and found ourselves needing another gate. We bought the same one, hoping to have the same experience. Unfortunately, the design of the gate has changed. It now has a clamp that goes over the bottom bar, rather than a dowel that goes into the bar. This is not an improvement. My medium sized Brittany can push the hand lever high enough to throw his weight against the gate, move the clamp over the bar, and open the gate. So it is completely worthless. It's too bad, because it is a very nice looking gate."
3,pet gate returned,"Overall I liked the look of the product. We needed a gate between the kitchen and dining room and the look of this gate would fit in very nicely with our home decor. It would also fit our smaller than usual door frame. The only reason we returned this item was due to the bottem of the gate's frame. When the gate is opened there is a lip on the bottem that you will always need to remember to step OVER in order to get through. Between the two of us and aging parents, one of us would forget and trip. It wasn't worth the risk of the injury."
5,a Life Saver,I absolutely love this gate. It's perfect for my mini- dachshund. He tries to jump on it but the spindles are just far enough apart that he can't balance on it but close enough together that he doesn't try to stick his head through. The gate swings both ways which is perfect. I placed it at the staircase landing. It fit perfectly between the two walls. Easy to get up and has stayed put even with the dachshund banging up against it when we leave. The wood part is really pretty and nice too. My dog who eats anything hasn't even nibbled at it.
1,New latch lock is HORRIBLE!!!,I am so disappointed in the new latch lock! I returned 2 already!! It doesn't close properly at the bottom! It was the best gate that I've ever had and I am so sad they tried to improve it. They ruined it!!!
3,Beautiful but didn't contain a big dog,"These are beautiful gates and were super easy to install (though one oddly sized doorway required some troubleshooting). However, our 1-year old Bernese Mountain Dog found a way to get over them within a week of use. Very unfortunate since they seemed like they would be the ticket with their height, but she really wanted out and made it happen (even though she had just been spayed a few days before and was supposed to be taking it easy)!In short, if you have a larger dog, don't waste your money like we did - they're smart enough to jump over."
5,great gate!,"This gate took a minute to figure out but it is pretty easy to install! It looks bent when you take it out of the box but it is supposed to be pressurized for it to straighten out. It is sturdy, nice looking, and easy to use."
5,Great Pet Gate,"The Richell 94118 Pet Gate is an attractive gate which installs easily and is very easy to use. Gates blocking a door that you use often can be very inconvenient, but this one is the most convenientand easiest to use that I have found over the years. the latch is easy to manipulate with one hand. It is more attractive than most and blends in with our decor very well. I have found no problems with it."
5,THE BEST.,This gate is a pleasure. I was so sick of falling over the stupid ones that you have to climb over.Highly recommended. Just wish it wasn't made of wood.
2,Not good for maximum width,"This gate seems to be well designed. We bought it because of the overwhelming positive reviews. Unfortunately, our own experience was quite different. We were looking to use this in our kitchen to stop once and for all the kids from feeding the dog. The opening required that we use the extensions (included) on the gate. Upon reaching maximum width, once pressure is applied to the sides the gate bows from the joints and pops right out of place. I tried cutting extensions from pieces of scrap wood to fit the endings inside to try and offer a bit more support but not even this worked. I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of stability when it reached the maximum length.So, if you're looking to use this at the minimum suggested width, you're probably in good shape. I'd stay away if you're on the longer end of the suggested width for this item."
5,Great looking,"Very functional, good looking, and fairly easy to set up. I use it for TH seco d bathroom, hoping to develop a safe place where my chi can be contained when I go out. So far, he still doesn't want to BR left alone, but TH gate is good!"
5,Even better than I expected!,"I ordered this gate to actually help keep my 24 month old granddaughter contianed when need be. The handle is just high enough out of reach that she cannot open the gate, and it is very, very sturdy. I had looked at several different gates, but I'm extremely pleased that I chose this one. 5 star gate!"
4,Degradation is inconvenient,"I genuinely like the product - it consistently works well for me, and Swanson is always prompt. However, at 2 per day, it takes a while to use up the 2-bottle package. In that time, the final several dozen capsules are all leaking and making a mess of pill containers. Not a deal-breaker, but a definite and continual drawback."
4,GOOD VALUE FOR UR $$,"Worth the $99.00 bucks i spent on this. Very good bass , replaced my sony MDR type with this, made a major difference."
2,Not office-friendly!,"First of all, I expected a leather-covered earphone cup. In reality these are a thin, plushy microfiber. I can't see this covering lasting for very long under constant office use and abuse. Secondly, I work in an IT ""cube-farm"" environment. When I listened to my music at a level that blocked out surrounding conversation, the whole office could hear exactly what I was listening to as if I had no headphones on at all. The reason I was ordering headphones and not earbuds was the specific reason of privacy and ambient noise blockage. With these, I got neither.Already requested an RMA and will probably end up going with the lower-priced Sennheiser HD202 model which is what another coworker already owns and is very happy with."
1,Sound bleeds so much these earphones can sub for loudspeakers,"I thought these earphone would be wonderful. The price was right and most importantly they're Sennheiser. I listen to a wide range of music from Classical to Electronica. I expected to have superior sound, which I did. No complaining there. HOWEVER, the sound bleed is OMG!! Ugh!! If you are listening to your ipod and you put your volume level 1/4th from silence, anyone sitting 12in to 3 ft away can hear every nuance of your music. Raise the volume any louder and you are/will violate the public transportation rule of ""No Boomboxes"". You are sharing your music with everyone, whether you or they like it or not. I was so mad I wanted to just throw them in the garbage. I guess you don't get quality unless you spend $200 for Sennheisers. Sweetwater catalogue, here I come!!"
2,I just wasted 50 bucks... my Sony's (20 Bucks) sound better.,"Try the mid-range Sonys, like the Sony MDR-XB500.. the bass in this SHs is not very good, and the headset is very uncomfortable... and my head is not that big. Another minus is the lenght of the cord, way too long. The design is nothing to write home about either.I bought them cause I wanted to try something new, big mistake. I'll try to sell them and get some new Sonys.Cheers."
3,Good highs and mids but just awful lows,"After reading reviews on these babies I decided to give them a shot and shell out the $50. When I put them on the day I got them I was honestly expecting more. The highs are the best part of the headphones. They come in crisp and clear. The mids are good but not any better than my Apple headphones that came with my iPod. Finally, the lows are just god awful. My Apple headphones do a better job!! I wasn't/am not very pleased but will be keeping the headphones because I hate the hassle of returning things. So, if you want the good thumping bass, go for dr. dre beats or something in that arena. I will probably never buy from Sennheiser again."
2,"Great comfort, decent sound, awful leaks. Disappointed.","Just got these today. Great form factor and comfort, good sound quality (mirror other observations). Sound leaks are awful though...my daughter was singing along and she was across the living room...could hear lyrics, every detail. Volume was at a low enough level that I could hear my fingers tapping on the table.Going to return these."
3,No,"These aren't headphones, these are speakers. The sound leakage is ridiculous, you can have the headphones on normal volume and anyone else in the room will be able to hear what you're listening to easily. The headphones have good sound though, and bass. The only problem is the sound leakage."
4,Nice,I think these are very nice headphones for the above average listen. Every serious music fan needs to have a nice set of headphones. These are great they are not the best but for an unamplified source they do a dang good job. I have not had problems like some of the other people but these are my first real set of headphones and I have only had them for a couple of days but no complaints yet.
4,Sennheiser HD 515 Review,"These headphones are amazing. The Sound quality is incredible and they are extremely comfortable. Sometimes I can barely feel like they are on my head. I have fairly large ears and the padding on the ear cups completely surrounds my ears and they don't hurt if you are wearing glasses. Now for the sound, the sound is unlike anything I have ever heard before from headphones. Keep in mind that sound quality really depends on the quality of the audio file and the quality of the sound card. I only have one major gripe with the HD 515's: the 3.5mm adapter is quite heavy. It has started to bend on mine (I have had them for about 5 months now). Overall, the HD 515's are an outstanding pair of headphones and I would definitely recommend Sennheiser products to anyone and would consider buying them in the future."
3,Decent headphones,"Got them on sale for I think only $50. They're good for what they are. EXTREMELY comfortable, which is always a plus. They're not some revolutionary headphones. But they're above average and am happy with my purchase."
4,Real speakers on your head,"Once you get used to the feel of the headphones, you tend to forget that they are headphones. It sounds like there's a pair of normal speakers on the table. I personally like the enclosed feeling of the normal headphones that makes me feel like I'm in my own capsule. I chose these open headphones over the traditional ones because I can hear my kids in the background (age 4 and 6.)Pros: Can hear ambient sound. Build quality is solid. Very long, high quality cable. Large, easily adjustable and fairly comfortable. Very good bass and decent high range. Although it's bulky, the well gripping mechanism makes these feel ""attached"" to your head and more compact than they really are. Definitely won't slip off.Cons: Can hear ambient noise. Cord is a little heavy. Weak mid-range. Definitely not a portable-mp3-player-friendly headphone.Overall a good investment, but I would pick a different pair next time (maybe the HD-280)."
3,Nice but not as good as expected,"Sound alright The bass is no where to be found, and don't even waste u time using it For Mp3 if u looking for bass bc u will not find any there. U may need a stereo something with power to even notise any type of bass in u headphone."
1,Horrible,"These are horrible. I wouldn't recommend them to anybody. A lot of people I know don't even fit into these. I have a friend name Carly, she has a very awkward-shaped head. Her head won't fit into these and when she puts them on they just fall off her head."
4,Good headphones for a low price,"Very comfortable, very good sound quality, and better ventilation than other headphones of similar quality so your ears don't get as hot."
4,Nice but not THAT nice,"Bought these about eight months ago to replace my wireless sennheiser phones that didn't work.These sounded good, but not that good. Not for the price. Strong bass, clear sound, comfortable fit, and excellent sudo-surround. I just think Sennheiser could do better for the price. The bass isn't as clear as it could be, or quite as strong, and they won't get as loud as I would like. Although, they probably get loud enough for most reasonable people."
4,Great for Incoming Audiophiles,"When I first got the headphones I was a bit surprised at the audio quality, but after reading reviews about how amazing the sound is after breaking them in, I gave it a couple of more days. The headphones sound amazing, in ALL ranges. I have two complains-Uses large headphone plug (Though does come with adapter...a bit bulky for portable use)-Bass is beautiful, but not powerful, this is solved by turning on bass enhancements on my stereo or computerI think that a amp would make these perfect."
3,A bit too tight! Good quality sound.,"I love the sound quality for the money. However, my complaint is that the headphone is a bit too tight. I can't wear it for too long because my face hurts. My friends tell me that I have a small head, too. =)Again, I'm not a sound quality expert, but it does the trick. I would recommend this over those overpriced BEATS created by Monster, which is the worst company in the world ripping off consumers left and right. This doesn't cancel out outside noise, but I can't complain for the price."
5,Great looks and sound for the money.,Just received my headphones from Amazon and I love them. They are very comfortable and sound great. They seem to be very well constructed and the long cord is great.
2,wasnt very comfy,"the nylon for comfort started peeliin off quickly there fore product wear, tears fast, i ended up selling them myseself"
3,My old HD400's sound just as good.,"Gave these headphones a try at Amazon's <$50 price. The biggest problem is they sound no better than the $20 Sennheiser HD400's that I have owned for years. They also had a bass rattle during a heavy bass passage. During the bass guitar solo in Rush's ""Limelight"" the left earpiece had a rattle. Have listened to this song hundreds of times on my HD400's and never experienced the rattle. Never noticed the rattle on other songs.I rated the comfort 2 stars. They just clamp to tight for my tastes. The plastic they use for the earcups and headband just feel cheap. Thank to Amazon's generous return timeframe I returned them after I gave them a through breakin which many folks say they need. To me they sound just OK, not good enough to keep."
3,Meh,"I just got these 'phones for Christmas. I plan on using them mostly for late night gaming but so far have only listened to music through my pc. 1st impressions are that the highs are a bit tinny and the lows are mids at best. They are comfy to wear for extended periods, and some songs sound fine, but when you want a deep resonant bass they just don't come through. Classic rap like ""Aint Nothin' but a G Thang"" which should be bass heavy and awesome come across as thin and metallic while more recent tracks like Radiohead's ""Reckoner"", which should be full and deep feel weak and flat. For blowing things up on my ps3 without waking the wife they'll work, but I would not reccomend these to the serious audiophile or anyone who needs a deep bass experience. As a gift for gaming, they'll probably be great, but for listening to my favorite songs I'll stick with my Bose earbuds."
4,They're alright I guess,"These headphones are pretty nice I guess. They kind of sound exactly the same as the cheapo $5 earphones I got from like Best Buy though. The only time you get to hear any difference is when there is some bass involved. These headphones have pretty nice bass response, and you can definitely tell the low frequency sound apart from the high frequency sound.They work pretty well with the new generation two iPod nanos. I know this because I have three iPod nanos. :)I'd recommend buying these since they're the cheapest in the Sennheiser 500 series of headphones."
4,Nice Sound for money,"I like the sound very much. Only dislike is the jack- the headphones come with an adapter so can be used with a ipod but, the jack size is large when using the ipod in a case- it will not push in completely."
3,"OK headphones, if you are alone in the room","Headphones do sound good. But someone standing next to you can hear them at almost the same volume as you do. Which kind of defeats the purpose of wearing headphones...If you just want a pair of speakers that you hang next to your hear, they are fine.Comfort-wise, they do feel kind of cheap... the padding feels like a cheep wool-like shirt."
3,Not what I expected,"I am a Loyal Sennheiser customer and was thrilled about the deal i got on theHD 515. But in my opinion your better off with the old faithful HD202 model forhalf the price. The open air design on these let in too much outside noise andmuddy the sound, the bass is lacking as well. Will sell these and go for the202's"
2,Nice but dont last,"I purchased a set of these a few months back. I have only used them a couple of dozen times, and the right speaker is blown already. I have only really used them for gaming, and have watched a few movies with them. No loud bass and in most cases the volume never goes above half."
2,"Great sound, squeze your head too hard, fabric like sand paper","They sound great. I love how it was as if a speaker was beside my ear rather than a pressured enclosure. I like that they don't touch my ears at all. I thought they squeeze just too hard on my head. I tried adjusting to a few different spots, with no luck. Just too tight. The fabric on the ear pads is like sand paper. I listened for a good 30 minutes one day before being anoyed with them, and set them down for a week. Five minutes ago I picked them up again, and could not stand it for even a minute of listening. Returning for a refund..."
2,Disappointed!,"I ordered the new edition when my copy of the 1994 edition started getting worn. What a disappointment! Aside from just not liking the new layout of the book, I was unhappy to find that now only major cities are included, making the new book almost useless to me since most of my travel is out of range of any of them. I hope Mr. Dingle and Peregrine Press take note of our comments and return his guide to its previous useful form. In the meantime, I'm keeping my old copy!"
2,"New Edition, LESS Information...","While I thought the first (1997) edition of the ""Essential Radio Guide"" was helpful, the fact that the new edition contains only half as much information as the first is disheartening. Mr. Dingle now uses an external source for his radio station data, and exludes not only the smaller stations, but entire markets as well. While it is not practical to include *every* U.S. radio station, skipping many medium-size markets severly limits this books usefulness. I had hoped to see *more* radio stations added in the new edition, or possibly Canadian radio (Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver, etc), instead of drastically fewer. While still useful if you only plan to visit the largest markets in the U.S., for most travel it will leave you hitting your car's scan button,waiting until you hit the next major city. Unfortunately, I find the older edition to be more helpful than the current one."
2,NOT for MEN,"this is a total chick book, not for men. All the stories except for 1, maybe 2, are by women, written with a female audience in mind. The several stories I did read through, before donating this to the library, were ok, nothing revolutionary though. Be advised, this book is for the ladies!"
5,great music,"i love simon cooper's music ..it's so sincere , relaxin ,inspirin , and just makes me feel better nomatter what ,his music really takes me so high ..he's a genious artist and i like the way he puts those notes together in great harmony to give us this amazin musici'm sure he'll be even more brilliant in the future when ppl all around the world listen and really appreciate his musicwish him all the best ..and hope i can buy his cds soon online from here ..syriacrush - syria"
2,This is not a plush at all. . .,"Happy ears eeyore is not a plush at all. Instead, it is a hard speaker box designed to appear as a plush. disappointing. Amazon's age reconmendations is appropraite and I am sure children in that age range will enjoy it. It is not a great gift for older children or adults however."
4,Great Toy!,My 15 month old loves this toy. It makes him smile and laugh so hard when Eeyore claps his ears. It was love at first site. He plays with all the time. Its easy for him to push his paw to make him sing. And he enjoys clapping to the beat.
3,Not totally what I had expected,"A friend had shown me this toy and I thought it to be the perfect gift for my 17 month old grandson. The Eeyore I had seen sang the song ""Do Your Ears Hang Low?"" while his ears flapped up and down. This happens to be my grandson's favorite song, and always seems to calm him down when he is upset. So when my Eeyore arrived I was quite disappointed to find that he did not sing, but only said a few phrases in his distinctive Eeyore voice. I just never thought that the same toy might have different voice offerings. While it is still a cute toy, it is not what I was expecting, and did not seem to have the reaction from my grandson that I was hoping for. Maybe after all the excitement of Christmas dies down and he has time to spend more time playing with his new toys, it will become a favorite. Only time will tell if this will be considered a hit."
2,"Okay, nobody condones the suffering of animals but...","Disease vectors in your home (mice, roaches), pests in your garden and in our ecosystem (Asian Longhorn beetle, Gypsy Moth), subsistence foodsources in plant limited environments (seals & fish to the Artic native peoples), all examples of legitimate killing of animals for human purposes, legitimate ones. Protecting our families, our property, nourishing our bodies are all real reasons to use animals and their products. While factory farming and gratuitous animal experiments bare close examination, we must maintain the status quo for important and ethical consumption of animals for human purposes. Yes indeed."
1,"Animal Rights Morons, Animal Rights Literature","This book, I find offensive. Offensive as being a human. These people calling themselves the ALF take it on their own to impeade medical research that saves lives. They ""Free the animals"" because THEY beleive it's ""the right thing to do"". Tell me this: If youre mother was dying of cancer, would you say ""Sure, go ahead and free the animals that might yeild lifesaving research"". Of COURSE NOT. These people are a disgrace to humanity. Don't support this peice of animal rights cant."
5,What perfume should be!,"This perfume is ever so lightly sweet and floral. Notice I said ""lightly""! It is not sugary sweet or strong like roses. It is gentle and absolutely the most amazing perfume I have ever smelled. It knocked my favorite right out of the water by a long shot! This truly is what perfume should be!"
4,Nina Ricci with an incorrect picture but GREAT buy,I gave this two stars not based on the perfume but rather based on the service. I am extremely disappointed with amazon and this order. The photo fo the product that I ordered was Ricci Ricci by Nina Ricci however after I ordered and it was shipped when i clicked on the link it registered as though I ordered Nina by Nina Ricci. I really not rather not go through the stressful return process so now if when the perfume gets here it is in fact Nina by Nina Ricci and not just a colossal mixup then i will have to buy Ricci Ricci. I will keep you updated.UPDATE: Okay so it seems to be a website mixup since I did receive the perfume that I ordred and oh wow is it glorious. It is strong it lasts long it is sweet woody and oh so sexy. I love it. GREAT purchase. I have updated my stars. I gave it four because they should really see to remedy that photo and link mixup on the site.
4,It's pretty cozy,"The scarf is warm and soft, the only problem is washing, which I believe is dry clean only. But, if you're like me and never wash scarfs, it shouldn't be that big of a deal."
5,An exceptional aide to planning a Disney vacation!,"If you or anyone you know is planning a vacation to Disney World you will want to own a copy of this book! It will help in planning all aspects of your visit to Disney --- including lots and lots of tips you can only get from someone whose been there and done it multiple times. It will help decide where to stay and what tickets to buy. It will tell you everything there is to do while you are there, how to get to places (with easy to read maps and descriptions all in one place), how to budget... It's simply a wealth of information and a really fun way of planning a stress-free vacation to Disney --- which could otherwise be quite overwhelming. I highly recommend it for anyone's Disney vacation planning!"
3,More than one reason to buy this book!,"I purchased this book to give to my grandson so he could remember our time in Disney and plan for a future trip. I also showed it to a friend who is going there for the first time in November and she immediately ordered a copy so she could best plan her trip before leaving home. Easy to read, easy to plan, create great memories."
1,This is a bad book.,"The main character is a loser, the story is far-fetched and meanders all over the place, the writing is terrible. It is also so bland, it isn't even a cozy. I wonder how it ever got published let alone how it supposedly won any award."
2,Disappointing Collection,"I love soup cookbooks and have over 30 of them. This collection is published by the American Diabetes Association as part of their Healthy Selects series - oddly, that information is not anywhere on the product page here. ""Savory Soups and Salads"" is obviously inexpensive, but it's not a particularly good buy overall. Specifically, the cookbook contains surprisingly few soup recipes - 22. The remainder of the book consists of salad, bread, and salad dressing recipes.The soup recipes that are included, though, are fairly good although basic, including Italian Minestrone, lentil soup, beef stew. In addition, extensive nutritional information is included for each. However, the book is rather skimpy with no pictures and minimal text, barely a notch above those ""cookbooks"" you can purchase in the grocery store check-out line. Unfortunately, ""Savory Soups and Salads"" is my first major disappointment from this site."
5,Absolutely delightful book,"This engaging story takes place during the polio epidemic of the 1950's, when an eleven year old boy was sent to spend the summer with his grandparents on their farm in Alabama. Cracker, so nicknamed by the locals, has many adventures, vividly and interestingly desribed as he matures from a boy to a young man. Billy Moore's narrative also imparts a colorful description of rural life. His use of ""country"" expressions adds much to the charm and authenticity of the book. This book is fast-paced and funny. It is a delightful read for both young and old.I look forward to reading more from Billy Moore!"
5,Of Frienship And Duty-A Great First Novel,"This is a great WWII novel, with action, intrigue, and emotion. A special Operational Group lead by Major James Stanton is deep in Nazi Germany where he finds himself battling the weather, German's, and more concerning the knowledge his team has been betrayed.This book explores the friendships that the men have developed during the war and the relationships they have forged, while at the same time are committed to their duty to their country and as soldiers."
1,poor quality frames,"I tried to save some money so I purchased this generic version of mp3 sunglasses. While the sound is acceptable, the frames are made of very cheap plastic & within 1 week of normal wear, had broken in three places. I'm gonna spend the extra money to get the namebrand version & the quality that comes with it."
5,Good Military Sunglasses,"I am deployed and I bought these so I wouldnt have to use the military issue glasses. They are way better!! I would suggest these to anyone that doesnt want their ""basic"" sunglasses."
5,Incredible,"This CD and Macabre are the two best albums that Dir en Grey have come out with. For a number of great hits, this album has it all; Jessica, Filth, Mushi, embryo and the amazing Bottom of the Death Valley. The guitars have improved beyond belief in this album, reaching the heights promised on Gauze and Macabre. Granted that when you start listening to an artist you want to go to the beginning and get the first album (or in this case the second since Missa is all but impossible to find these days) but in this case, skip Gauze and go straight to kisou or Macabre."
5,Right-Hand reference material,"Whenever I need some help with Visual Basic.net, this is the first source that I use. Sometimes it is better than the on-line help. I would supplement this book with the ""Visual Basic.Net: The Complete Reference"" book. I would highly recommend that both books be added to your Visual Basic.Net reference library. Although not as fast as the on-line help, the book provides better answers to your Visual Basic.Net questions. The only error that I found is ADO.Net becomes ADO.Next in the chapter on ADO.Net. Must have been the publisher."
1,Not impressed,"I bought a 2-pack of these lights from a local ACE Hardware store. It bore a sticker stating that it was discounted via PG&E;'s Residential Lighting Program. My local utility endorses this product, so it must be good, right? Think again. I just applied to Greenlite USA for warranty replacement. Both of them failed in about three years of use. That's a 100% failure rate. LEDs are normally supposed to function for about 100,000 hours, or 11 years. These units didn't even get close, considering they're equipped with a photocell, so they only light about 10 hours per day. At that rate, they should have lasted over 25 years.My recommendation: Don't buy this Chinese-made product and be very suspicious of other Chinese-made Greenlite USA lighting products, especially if they're endorsed by your local public utility."
3,Singer needs a better band,"A respectable album. This band might have made it but timing and luck weren't on their side. Some songs are fun in the typical 80's way. The vocal quality is intense- heads above those 80's sleaze rockers like Vince Neil and Brett Michaels but the songwriting is weak. The first three songs are solid (I personally love the cover of ""I'm Eighteen""). 4.5 stars to the singer 2.5 stars to the rest of the band."
5,HURRICANE-OVER THE EDGE,"I COULD NEVER FIND FOR LESS THAN 70.00 DOLLARS USED!FINALLY AMAZON HAD IT BRAND NEW FOR 30.00 DOLLARS,AND ON TOP OF THAT IT WAS REMASTERED!PICK THIS ONE UP BEFORE IT GOES AWAY!THIS IS A FIND OF A LIFE TIME! THE C.D. ROCKS AND THE VOCALS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!20 STARS!ALSO PICK UP THERE FIRST C.D. ENTITLED HURRICANE-ALSO 20 STARS!AMAZON CARRIES THIS ALSO REMASTERED FOR 35.00 DOLLARS!"
1,hurricane this cd is a waste of money.,i had this on cassette in the late 80's 1 catchy tune ...im on to you.this song grows old quick na na na na na nah im on to you.the other songs just blow as well. im surprised to see this cd selling used for over $70.00any one dumb enuf to pay that should get a cd that sucks as bad as this one does.this band went nowhere & was so short lived its amazing.they lasted as long as a hurricane here & gone.
4,Great Album that was Overshadowed by the Mainstream Bands!,"This is a great album! ""Over the Edge"" and ""I'm Onto You"" are great 80's anthems! The only question I have is why Kelly Hansen went from singing these songs to ""Hot Blooded"" and ""Cold as Ice"" in Foreigner. He should call up Robert Sarzo and get Hurricane back together again and play Rocklahoma!"
5,excelente,"good product, I was very pleased with the same features found in the ad is entirely consistent with reality. I recommend it, although it took a while to arrive."
2,One excellent CD packed with 2 mediocre ones.,"This collection contains Comfort Zone, Dawn, and Higher Ground. Comfort Zone and Dawn are OK, but don't come close to Halpern's Spectrum Suite and the recently released Serenity Suite. Higher Ground is excellent. I would buy individual CD's rather than the collection."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I absolutely love this movie. At first I did buy it because it has Joe McIntyre in it. But, after watching the movie, I fell in love. The whole movie has such class and a spirit that really showcases the family represented. It showcases the struggle of a man, who is doing something out of his element, and how he perseveres through it all. AWESOME!!! The good movies always get released to dvd first."
4,On Broadway and in your hearts.,This is absolutely a lovely film. You can't go wrong with this one. Especially if you are a fan of feel good movies. You might need a hanky and a cold Guinness but you're sure to enjoy. Cheers!
4,pretty good x-men story...,"i'm not sure why this collection is so highly rated; maybe it's because it's the end of the claremont/byrne run.the tpb is a disjointed collection, which goes from the x-men going through the 9 levels of hell a la dante's inferno, to wolverine and nightcrawler in canada fighting the wendigo, to some x-men fighting mystique and the brotherhood trying to kill senator kelly, to kitty pryde and some other x-men trying to change the past and thus the future.altogether they are solid if somewhat unrelated stories.ok let me clarify...x-men 141 and 142, the days of future past, is a great classic comics storyline. but this tpb collects some unrelated stories before and after i guess just to be longer, so it kind of throws off the storyline if you think this whole tpb is one long connected story which it isn't."
3,"Good, but not excellent","Marvel could ""pimp"" this TBP. It's too basic. But the story and the art are amazing. It's worth the price."
1,Crimes of Omission,"Disappointingly, this uneven collection focuses on relatively marginal writers (e.g, Minette Walters instead of Elizabeth Peters), and has odd emphases. Does the reader really care in each essay about the religious convictions, real or speculated upon, of every single author? Charlotte Macleod is noted only as a biographer, and other ignored authors are Sharyn McCrumb, Mary Stewart, Jane Haddam, Dell Shannon...oh, the list is endless!"
2,Soft metal,"Be careful when using this screws, it can cross tread easily due to softer metal. It looks like it's made out of aluminum."
5,Quality,These are very nice and work extreemly well. Its just what it say it is and does a great job of holding my amps nice and tight. Good quality screws at a great price! I highly recommend
1,RIPOFF,I purchased this item on shopping.com thinking it was a 32 inch tv. It showed a picture on the site but was a fake. (...).
1,Looks a fraud,"I was refered to this site by shopping.com. where I search for a tv, I got one that I liked it is the Philip 32PT8320 $150.00 after I review the TV, I was decided to buy it, so I click on Buy it at Amazon, and what I got was Amazon selling a Silver TV stand for the TV model above mentioned, the same price as the TV advertised in Shopping.com, Like I said I was ready to by the TV, the word Stand, in you description make think it over. In other words instead of the tv I would have get the TV stand, which is not was advertised in the Shopping.come site. I am not making you liable for this, but I would like to have some answer."
2,Missing piece,Talked and emailed with the company who admitted they were having trouble with some missing pieces (just not the green that I had ordered) Promised over and over to mail piece!!! Did't respond to BBB of their state. Too big for me to repack and return.
4,Good underwater pictures,Easy to carry in and out of the water with the rubber strap. Pictures turned out well and was great to have on our snorkeling adventure. The camera was worth the money spent.
4,Speedy Delivery,It was very hard to find these cameras at such a decent price. Plus getting them so fast was great. Can't wait to try these out on my honeymoon.
5,Great,"Book was in a good condition, the price was excellent. Shipping took a lil' bit longer than I'd expected but not bad."
4,GOOD BOOK BUT TAKES TIME,I THINK THIS BOOK IS ONE THE BEST I'VE EVER READ ON THE GRE TEST.IT IS A TOTAL PACKAGE AND I STRONGLY URGE EVERYBODY WHOSE GOT ATLEAST 2 MONTHS FOR THE EXAM TO GO IN FOR THIS BOOK.
2,Included software has malware?,"The book itself is OK, but the downloadable software gets flagged as containing malware. If you are planning on making a purchase decision based on the included software, steer clear."
2,do not recommend,The author puts too much of his opinion in the reading comprehension section. Answers are vague and i questioned whether I should learn why HE justifies his answers. Perhaps a different answer would be correct on the GRE! He comes off as pompous and sexist and the author's voice should not come through at all in an instruction book.
2,Not as shown,"The item is not as pictured in advertisement. The bonnet nut is not included with the stem. This is very misleading when you are expecting the item with the bonnet nut attached.Don,t buy if you can't get your old bonnet nut off of the stem you are replacing as the bonnet nut is very difficult to find if you have to rplace it. I have yet to find it."
1,Be Cautious!,"I returned this product after 3 weeks and, like the previous buyer, I was charged about $50.00 too. The quality is not worth it. The slide does not stay on the ground properly. It is rolled when you receive it and for some reason I could never unroll it so that it remained flat. There was a permanent curl at the end and it would end up rolling at each end automatically! This was dangerous because I nearly fell several times trying to slide and the curved ends were not secure. The company should put the rubber backing on the entire product not just the end. Anyway, save your time and money and research other products because you will be charged for shipping and restocking too...if returned."
2,"Fun, but doesn't last under constant use.","Hi. I received this slider last Christmas and I loved it at first. It was a wonderful slide and a great way to do cardio workout.But after using it for only 10-15 a day, approximately 3 to 5 a week, it became so stratched (using the attached booties) that even dousing it with pledge before ever work out, it would just not slide as it should. And this happened after only 2 or 3 months of ownership.If it was a little bit better made, then I would have loved it, but it just didn't hold up and it is priced a little high for something that doesn't hold up."
1,Not a good choice for long-term training,"I am a 180 lb amateur speed skater. I bought one of these about a year ago and it lasted a few months before the adjustable white stop cracked and became non-functional. I was told by the retailer that I bought it from that this had never happened previously, so I bought another one. This one also lasted only a few months before having the exact same problem. The adjustable stop simply does not hold up to repeated strong push offs. Save yourself the hassle and buy a different product."
1,Plastic junk,"I have purchased 2 of these for my wife in the past, I guess that I was the dummy for buying a second onethe white ends both crack across the bolt holes and then the slide is junkthey should reinforce this area do to the pressure, just another peice of 21st century plastic junk"
5,Beautiful bowls,"These bowls are even nicer than they appear in the picture, almost little works of art. They are slightly larger than I expected. I ordered them to use for dipping bowls but they are large enough to serve many purposes. I'm happy to see that there are other, matching pieces. My husband loves to prepare Asian meals and the different pieces will make wonderful gifts."
5,I still listen to it years later!!,"I heard this when it came out, and then spent years looking for it to add to my collection! It took me years to find it again. This album is one of the best classically inspired speed metal CD's of all time. I still listen to it years later! Yngwie wish he made this album, because its up there with Marching Out. My favorite parts of the album is the sounds bites of Christopher Lee's dracula dialogue that prelude incredible metal riffs. All instruments are very skilled, and the singing is typical metal operatic, but very, very cool. Did i mention it makes good halloween music!??! :-)"
4,Even the bad guys want one!,"I bought two of these Razor bikes for my nephews for Christmas. They had to wait until spring to ride them because of the winter weather, but really loved all the cool tricks they could do on these bikes. They were the only kids in the neighborhood to have the Razors. Well, not anymore, seems the bikes were so nice that even the local bike theives had to have them and they have already been stolen from their yard. They were really sharp looking bikes and at $99.00 each (at Xmas), and free shipping, I felt like I was getting a steal, guess I was right. Next time I buy a chain for them too."
1,Not Good.,"I got one because I had a BMX park near my house and I needed a BMX bike.So I decided to get this one.Well first of all its defiantly NOT a professional BMX bike.The tires pop when ever I try to jump.Also,the handlebars move forward when I jump.It weighs over 43 pounds!!Thats CRAZY HEAVY for a BMX.I might as well stick to riding my brother's $375 Hoffman BMX.If anybody is wondering what a Hoffman bike is,its the most professional BMX bike that money could buy.All of the Hoffman's are more bang for your buck. To buy a Hoffman,go to [...] for the Hoffman Scarab EL.Its the best performer for your money."
5,Great band,"Grew up listening to Crow and other great bands, it's to bad it's so hard to buy CD's at a price that won't break the bank. Time to re-release some of these classic tunes, Yellow Dawg, King of rock and roll etc. a hundred bucks a CD won't get it done."
1,"1 star for RIPP-OFF price, BUT a Great Band!",This price is a fat rip-off-------nuff said. I saw Crow many times in the early 70's in central WI. Really an excellent live band with a great sound and an energy that most bands never approached. There have been maybe a dozen state/regional bands that I would rather have seen live than most national bands. Crow was one of those bands.
3,CROW -1 of the very best,"I haven't heard this cd nor will I if the prices stay high...I have all the LP's anyway.In my opinion CROW recorded THE DEFINATIVE version of ""Sky is Crying"". I'd put it up against ANY other version.How you can call this the best of without including it is RIDICULOUS!"
4,Crow music......,"I,ve been familiar with Crow for many years (since the early 70's), but had very limited access to most of their material.....after aquiring this CD, and giving it 4 or 5 listens, I came to the conclusion that this band was very talented in their own original way.....practically every song has something special to offer...there are other very good tunes besides ""Evil Woman"" and ""Cottage Cheese"" (my personal favorite).I am very pleased with the contents of this CD.....even though I payed much more than I would normally spend on any single CD, the fact that it is out of print I'm sure is the reason for that. That aside, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
3,"Interesting, but really, uh, weird.","This was my first Playstation Game. I was totally freaked about finally geting a PSX. I played this game, and for a while it was fun. Then it got too challenging, too fast paced, too redundant, and too BOR-Ring. If you're looking for a game that will give you at least 10 hours of play, don't buy this. For one, the graphics are mediocre, and you are always in a 3rd-person side view. Secondly, most missions are more of a maze than an RPG or Action level. Finally, you are a spider, armed with you're butt's spinning power, a knife, and a gun or two. Again, if you are looking for a realistic action/RPG game, look elswhere."
1,I WAS DECEIVED,DELIVERY OF THE GAME WAS LENGTHY AND THEN WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS NOT THE OFFICIAL SPIDER MAN GAME BUT SOMETHING WITH A SIMILAR TITLE: A CLASSIC CASE OF BAIT AND SWITCH.
4,"Good collection of essays, but not an introductory text.","""The Nazi Revolution: Hitler's Dictatorship and the German Nation,"" (Problems in European Civilization)by Allan Mitchell (Editor) is a wonderful up-to-date collection of essays from top-notch historians on the current historical debates surrounding the causes and actions of the Nazi Revolution.Books from the PROBLEMS IN EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION SERIES are designed for upper-level undergraduate and graduate level European history courses. That being said, this book is not an introductory text. The authors of the articles go directly into their subjects, without providing any significant background information. Therefore, you need to have an historical base level of knowledge to work from. Nonetheless, it is an excellent tool for students, scholars and general readers of modern European history.The text is best used in class discussions and debate.An excellent representation of Nazi historical scholarship."
4,"Small, but nice, great price, looks great with towels in it","This is a great product especially for the price. Looks great, especially if you put nice towels rolled up in it. Wish I hadn't given it as a gift!"
4,Suna (Sand) Headband,"this was perfect! the only probelm i had with it was the metal plate (my head is oval-ish so the metal plate was a little long)anyways, great buy and perfect timing! ^ ^"
5,"Great quality, great product.","I used this for my Temari costume I wore to an anime convention. The quality is very good and I thought I paid a good price for it. The size is appropriate, much better than others I've seen. I had to shape it a bit to get it rounded. I used the edge of a counter to bend it, since the metal is pretty thick. I got it to where I wanted it easily enough. Would recommend buying this product. Seller is excellent as well, fast delivery."
4,"Durable, with care","I have had this birdbath for about 5 years. It has been a great product, with a couple of minor problems. Within the first year or so, the clamp bolt had rusted so tightly, I couldn't get it off the deck for maintenance. I didn't want to try to force it, since the tightening knob is plastic, and I'm pretty sure it would break if I took a wrench to it. It was stuck on the deck in all weather, included freeze/thaw cycles of Maryland winters, and it eventually developed a crack in the deepest part of the bowl after the fourth winter. This gave it a very slow leak, but it was still usable through its fifth summer. I'm definitely doing to buy another one to replace it, but this time I'm going to maintain it better, so I can take it indoors for the worst of the winter season. Mourning doves especially love it, using my wide deck rail to rest and bask in the sun between dips in the pool :)"
1,I needed to make an inquirey about this pack system,"I called the listed customer service number,and I got a recorded voice advising me I was customer number one,it told me that for 20 minutes,and there was extremely annoying music on the wait,I don't think I will be purchasing this CFP-90 pack system from this guy."
5,Fun Mini Goober bear,"All the Gund Goober bears are fun and adorable. Everybody who loves teddies loves Goober, I'm sure."
2,More psychological than practical,Lots of stories about how others had break through overachievement. There was less instruction on how to actually achieve this.
3,fair to middling,"Eliot's book has some good advice, mostly in the ""get used to pressure"" area, but it also contains far too many errors of fact that should have been caught by copy editors, if not by the author himself. One of the worst is referring to Jack Kemp as Bob Dole's running mate in the 1988 presidential campaign (it was 1996). Errors like this make one wonder how reliable Eliot's other advice can be.It is good to urge people to get away from their comfort zones and embrace the pressure that true achievement requires, but all behavior requires a basis in fact and not just in some rah-rah cheerleading that will fade as soon as the excitement of the moment passes. This is what keeps Eliot's book and advice from being as great as it could be.As the ancient wisdom says, Physician, heal thyself. First, fix all the problems in your own book. Then tell the rest of us how to fix our lives."
3,"Big singles, not a bad album","""Searchin for a Rainbow,"" has two of the Marshall Tucker Band's best known tunes, the title track and ""Fire on the Mountain."" It also has a fairly decent live rendition of the hit ""Can't You See,"" from their debut album. The song ""Virginia"" is another good love song. The rest of the material is largely filler, and sounds closer to country music than most of their other albums from the 1970s. In fact, its a shame that MTB turned their back on rock music. The albums ""A New Life,"" and ""Where We All Belong"" could take their place next to any Allman Brothers or Lynyrd Skynyrd album. ""Searchin' for a Rainbow"" is a decent album that lacks the rock energy of some of their earlier works."
5,One of My All Time Faves,"A definite five star recording. Eight songs and all of them classics to my ears. Love the poignant opening track, Fire On The Mountain with a stunning acoustic guitar arrangement. Numbers like Walking' And Talkin' and Bob Away My Blues have a soothing jazz feel. During my college days I can recall a die hard Motown/Soul fan liking these two tunes. It probably was one of his few forays into rock and country music. Can't You See is just brimming with a rock n roll spirit as Toy Caldwell's vocal and guitar solo are both just super in a live setting.The Marshall Tucker Band certainly cover a lot of ground on this fine release. The instrumental arrangments just captivate my ear. Pick it up at once as I feel its their best work."
4,Marshall Tucker Band- Searchin' For A Rainbow,"Marshall Tucker Band-""Southern Rock"" might be BEST 'how to describe them'.Yet, THE QUALITY ""of the group"" makes them LIKE NO OTHER SOUTHERN ROCK BAND (ie. Allman Brothers or Lynyrd Skynyrd.)WELL 'worth' THE LISTEN."
3,Goof for advance users,"Only if you've already done some elementary courses about sugar flowers, otherwise this book is difficult for you. Have pictures showing the appearance of how the flowers are done but the description is not as straight forward. Ideas are good though!"
4,A lost jewel found!,"I found this CD on accident. I was only 7 when this album came out. But to say that I missed out on this group is an understatement. I am from the West Coast, so we were not able to have exposure to Starz as the East Coast. This CD is awesome...I wished I could have been listening to this in 1976 instead of Wings or Elton John. Buy this CD!!!! You will not go wrong...Detroit Girls should have been a huge hit...."
5,Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance,"I found this book to be extremely valuable. It serves as a great introduction to ""Zhuan Falun"" written by the same author. Mr Li, Hongzhi has given people a great gift in these two books and others that he has written. Falun Gong teaches principles of improving the mind and the body and uplifting the human spirit.I have read many books in my life, but none are more wonderful in this entire world than the books that Mr Hongzhi has written. My mind has opened up to a whole new world that is seemingly enormous. In this book Mr. Hongzhi also describes how to perform the simple but powerful exercises of Falun Gong. ...."
1,Qi Gong = magic??,This book is confusing because the author says Qi Gong is the equivalent to magic in the western society. How can an ancient form of exercising become some entertaining stuff? The author even mentions David Copperfield can really break through the wall. Very confusing.
1,If you understand some very basic scientific norms...,"If you understand some very basic scientific norms, forget about this book.The author, Li Hongzhi said light-year is a unit of time in this book. How can such a ...guy abuse sciences so loudly"
1,unreasonable,"just imagine if master li really possesses the supernatural power as he professed, he should have known what the Chinese gov. was going to do to him before he HEARD something, and from Australia he should have ""seen"" what his students were doing in beijing before being TOLD about that."
2,"Not clear, very vague and good exercises","I find the book very unclear and mystical, but I love me some Falun Gong exercises. I have been doing them for several months using the videos from there web sites. Also, I think the music is cool. It's a matter of do not listen to him, just watch him."
4,Grasshopper on the Road,I like the book called Grasshopper on the Road. Grasshopper wants to go on an adventure. He finds a road. He finds one that goes all around town. In his adventure he meets some bugs along the way. I would give it a 4. I like the pictures and story but I didn't like all the dark colors that the illustrator used. Dark colors are gloomy.
4,Grasshopper Review,"I would recommend this book to anyone, both young and old. The grasshopper wants to go on a journey and he finds a road. On this road he encounters many insects different from himself. His meetings are funny and make you want to turn the page to see what he might encounter next. It is easy to read for early readers and is a cute and silly story that makes reading fun."
2,Good at best.....,"Having enjoyed hi-end home audio and video products for some time now. (Dolby Digital, S-VHS, DVD) I am very dissapointed in this product. While it is convienent (one star) and compact (second star), you will find yourself ""toggleing"" (adjusting the picture), for every movie or format you choose. Or if your buy where the return policy permits, you will find yourself returning it. In other words ""don't buy on ebay"". The Trek can be found for much less than listed prices there but good luck returining the product unless it is defective. And after seeing the picture quality you will think it is. While it is a great concept, the head mounted display is still too heavy and requires frequent adjustment to relieve pressure points. Try again Olympus, you can do better! natralman@aol.com"
3,High Water Adventures,"Even though the characters seem a little young to have their attitudes, this book is a well written story about two opposites coming together."
2,They never made it for a reason,"Since 1980 I have tried in vain (and hard) to really like this band. Although Starz are comprised of competent players, their songs are simply bogawful! Sorry, it's as simple as this.(Two star rating for the nice guitar sound)"
5,Very good.,Excellent 2nd book in trilogy. Won't want to put it down untill finished. Highly recomend!!
2,Replacement battery does not fit well,I did not like this product. The iPod mini replacement battery is too large to fit in the original case.
5,Jar Jar is so funny.,"Jar Jar is so funny because he slurps up a frog and he splashes it into Sebulba's soup. That made my great-grandmother crack up! She read the whole book with me and she said funny things about the book. I think she was so excited that I could read it by myself, and thought that the book was extremely funny."
4,affordable alternative,"This lens is a top preformer. It is a solid lens for the novice photography enthusiast. I use it with black and white film as well as some basic color films and everytime the photo turns out nice. The only drawback is the lens construction. It just feels like it is really delicate. Minolta lenses seem to be constructed more sturdy. But hey, just be careful with your camera and everything will be ok."
3,"This could have been better, even for a slim volume","Mr. Barranger had good intentions and certainly very interesting subject matter, but really did very little with it. This slim volume was far too repetitious for its size. What he does reveal for the reader will be astounding for the uninitiated, but more than likely will just be confusing unless one has read Sitchin's ""Twelfth Planet"" or Bramley's ""Gods of Eden"" beforehand. While Barranger explores the more religious aspects of the ""pretender"" or ""extraterrestrial gods"" theory he had so much to work with that was under-utilized. I would still recommend this but with reservations. And OH those many typos!"
3,Not that shocking,"If you're familiar with this type of material you might need a more detailed book like Sitchin, Daniken ect. This is a lightweight of a book."
1,No new information,The only value in this book might be for those who are unfamiliar with the subject is that he makes reference to some useful books on the subject. There is absolutely nothing new presented in terms of what is now known regarding the gods of old. The author repeats himself so often it is difficult to finish the book. He talks of the Real God but never manages to identify or explain what he means. Don't wast money on this book.Desmond
5,"A superb book. Excellent pictures, great explanations.","I have two books of the same author: Masterpieces of marquetry (or something simmilar since it is written in French) and Marquetry. Each of the books cost over 100 USD in France and belong to a collection this author has published on the same subject. The Marquetry book (in English) I believe is the best book of its class. It has very detailed sketches of real antique designs. It not only explains the techniques but also stone inlaying, designing of tools and benches for cutting materials, etc."
5,Outstanding!,I found this book to be completely comprehensive on the subject of marquetry. Everyone who loves this art form will want to have this in their library.
2,"Great Pictures, bad reasearch","The series of pictures is worth paying for the price of the book, but the author misses the mark on research. First, Hogan himself says he was not left handed but that the first club he could afford was a lefty club. Second, In his banner year, he did not, as everyone knows, win the PGA. I'm not sure how everyone could have let this one slip. Third, if you've ever watched video of Hogan swinging in his prime, that club gets back pretty far with an iron. Azinger is a 3/4 swinger, Hogan made a nice long swing. The average golfer who tries to make too short a swing ends up coming over the top of the ball. Buy it for the pictures though, they are wonderful."
4,See for yourself,"Boy, mixed reviews on this one! I can appreciate the feelings of the die-hard Hogan-ites, who would rather die than see anything added to or taken from the 5 LESSONS; but to classify the book a total lemon is unfair. I agree with whoever said that this book would be a good companion. At the very least, it reaffirms the brilliance in Hogan's teachings. I do not, however, whole heartedly agree with what the author tries to establish as ""lost fundamentals"". If Hogan had thought these to be true fundamentals, then he would have put them in his book. Furthermore, some of the so called ""lost"" fundamentals ARE in the book (i.e. ENOUGH lateral movement). Even so, the insights and wonderful photographs in this book can be very useful, I think, in the FURTHER study of swing mechanics. My advice: See for yourself. Check it out at your local book store, and then decide (oh, yeah, and buy from Amazon ;0)."
1,Very Bad,"Other than some nice photographs of Hogan, this book has little to offer. Just another case of an author exploiting the name of a great athlete. Isn't this the same author who twice used Tiger Woods' name on the cover of books that the golfer had nothing to do with? If the author knows so much about the swings of Woods and Hogan, why doesn't he put that knowledge to use on the course? This book is a stinker."
2,whatever happened to editing?,"This book contains some useful information, particularly the discussion of the lateral move on the downswing (which Hogan's Five Lessons overlooked, thereby ruining many a beginner's swing). Unfortunately, the book is very poorly organized - the author jumps from one unrelated topic to another, often on the same page, making it difficult to follow. Some of the technique descriptions are just plain confusing, even for an experienced golfer. I didn't find the illustrations or photos to be particularly illuminating, either. Recommended only as a supplement to Five Lessons and other, better organized instruction books."
5,Secrets Revealed,"It's too bad I was not able to give The Hogan Way six stars, because it certainly deserves that high rating. I have read numerous magazine articles and books looking to solve the mysteries of Hogan perfect swing technique. Finally and author has explained Hogan's swing secrets -- many that he never talked about or apparently was not aware of himself. Another reason I enjoyed this book so much is the photographs. Even in Hogan's bestselling book, Five Fundamentals, there were no photographs. In this one, a rare photographic sequence showing Hogan swinging, plus other photographs of this shotmaking master playing other shots, helped me understand Hogan's swing. A tremendous reference book that I will refer to throughout my golfing life."
5,GREAT STORY,"I bought this book to ""hold me over"" and I'm so glad I did I fell in love with the story and the characters! I can NOT wait to read the next one. Plus the book mark I got from the website was pretty cool too. This was definitely not a cliche vampire story, it was so original I couldn't see what was coming!"
1,Read the fine print,"I ordered this product for my Pre-K classroom, however I failed to read the fine print which states ""Content developed exclusivley for Comfy Keyboard."" In other words, the product can only be used with their specialty keyboard. This might be a great product, but I don't know b/c I can't turn it on."
4,The bayesan applications of game theory,This book treats all the principal arguments of actual game theory. But particullary it studies the Bayes theorem. The importance of this fact is known also in biology and in the information theory. The tree strategies have the possibility to converge at equilibria. Myerson analyses the method for stabilizing also random subcessions.
2,Not For Laymen,"I'm sure it's a wonderful book, but some of the other comments were misleading. If you aren't really studying game theory this book is not for you. I was hoping for something less theoretical and more applicable."
5,still on the frontier because of disinformation,This book is not good only because it explains all well known difficult concepts which noone so far has been able to explain clearly and rigourosly in one book but for new important topics that are less known for the majority of game theorists. I'm refering to the idea of networks and cooperation structures and also cooperation under uncertainty with the idea of virtual utility.
4,Great Textbook On Game Theory,"This is a great book, containing an incredible wealth of knowledge. It's all explained very well, by one of the premier game theory experts in the world (who also won the Nobel Prize, by the way). I'm not surprised at all to see that this book has been reviewed by several Ph D students.The only problem is that it's a difficult read. Don't be fooled by the word ""introduction"" in the description: this book is packed with mathematics, and is written in a very dense, academic style. If you want a more lighthearted introduction to game theory, without all the equations, I highly recommend ""Thinking Strategically"" by Dixit and Nalebuff. It may not be quite as substantive as this tome, but it's a much better choice for the semi-casual reader."
4,Good picture of Central America during civil war.,"This book gives a good picture of El Salvador during the civil war. It tells the story of Jean Donovan who at some point of her life decided to throw away her career and to help the people who were suffering in El Salvador. She describes her struggle trying to help the poor to survive while being attacked (verbally and physically) by land owners, officials, military, death squads, and American intelligence. While her being an American citizen usually kept her out of the worst trouble, the locals were usually not so lucky and often killed rather arbitrarily. What makes the book so interesting is that it is not written from a global political viewpoint, but from the very personal viewpoint of Joan Donovan."
5,Salvador Witness: The life and calling of Jean Donovan,"A truly remarkable person. Jean Donovan gave love, commitment, and in the end, her life so that the poor of El Salvador could have a chance. Salvador Witness looks at the life of Jean Donovan and her journey to life as a missionary in war-torn El Salvador. Anyone who wants to be inspired by a truly great 'saint', then read this book."
3,Very good product,This is a great fiber product but do yourself a favor and buy psyllium husk veg cap instead . I really loved this product and used it for years it was definitely a lot better then those metamusil brands but . But discovered psyllium is away less harsh on the guts
3,It's ok.,"I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. It's more like an extended pamphlet than a book (it has a stapled binding) and is filled with spelling, grammar and punctuation errors. It does outline some basics in a child-friendly format, but should be priced under $10.00."
1,FIT in WICH model or chasis,"How we know for which model this fender is, for example i am needing for my 660 sl 1986 chasis w107 , will this product fit?????Jose Ayala"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought it for my baby when she was about 16 months... First I thought it was great... but she would get easilly bored with how siple the games were... and for $20 it was definitley not worth the money. I bought another game for get called Animal World, and it seemed too boring for her as well. I wish I would have done a better research, because I was very dissapointed with the product... and my daughter would get easilly bored with it and so now the keyboard is laying there without it ever being used. I have tried to download the games online (pay for them) and the one I found would not work which was very frustrating, because the games are way too expensive for being that simple! I would not reccomend it, there are many more fun toddler keyboard games (where you can use your regular keyboard) if you just google them!"
1,Misleading,"The book sucks. A book titled ""The Art of Lying"", with calligraphy scribbled across it, instantly brings thoughts of Sun Tzu The Art of War. This book has none of the quality and splendor of the war gods ancient text. It gives short stories on lying to ones spouse and how it is lying. Instead of reading this book, go watch Jerry Springer and you will get the same feel."
2,Lying presented as a craft,How can we verify that the authors are telling the truth about the subject of their book?
3,cute boots for the price,"these look better on with skinny jeans or leggings than they do just sitting there. the suede on the gray pair that i bought is kind of cheap looking, and is slightly browner than it seems in the photos here on amazon. the sole is slippery and i'll have to rough it up outside on the asphalt to keep from slipping when its wet out. i wasn't crazy about the flower cut-outs when i bought these, and i still am not (although its hard to tell from the amazon photos, the cut-outs are silver metallic). they are comfortable enough, though, and for $38, the price is right."
4,Just Really Good,"This is less R & B than it is Soul. ""Subtle Ways"" fits nicely next to Macy Gray's ""How Life Is"" as much as it does next to Average White Band or Jamiroquai.There is an artistry to the way the CD is composed; actually, probably much like a live performance. This is a group of musicians that understands the art of making music. The amazing ""Internal Light"" is 13+ minutes of audience seduction, mostly by percussion or the absense of it.If you are looking for something new and diverse to spin, Maktub will fit the bill perfectly. If you are looking for purist R & B, then this may not be for you. I, personally, am enjoying the ""Subtle Ways"" of this CD more every day that I listen to it."
1,heavy mix of music from the 80s,"do you think late 80s luther vandross, sound garden, and portishead would make a good mix? maybe? maybe not...if you are looking for a 5 star heavy jazzy bluesy 90s soul CD I would strongly suggest ""Brown Sugar"" by D'angelo. Lauren Hill liked it so much she invited D'Angelo to sing on her Grammy award winning CD."
1,They're tryin' but I ain't buyin'!,"I don't understand the sudden popularity of this horrible band. I'm sure the people of Seattle are just plain sick of the nameless faceless songless grunge acts that are still hanging around, but PLEASE! There are still better local acts in Seattle than this white-washed soul-less soul act. It's almost offensive to call this soul. Make up a new genre and stick this band in it. Give them their own genre. How about ""unimpressive music?"" Or better yet, I'd like to see this CD in the ""Say what?"" section at Tower Records. Another Dave Mathews Band has reared it's ugly head, stealing a label from geniuses and making it okay for tasteless people to say they listen to ""soul music."" Otis must be rolling in his grave."
5,abrams journey quest forthe man in the stars,"this book was a great read from the begining of the book it captures your mind and wont let go , in the end it leaves you wanting to read more. i put the writing style in the same class as the left behind series. really great read it took me one day to complete because i couldnt put it down."
1,"Idiotic, Marxist sectarian crap","Chip Berlet thinks that anyone who isn't a left-liberal Democrat is part of the Ku Klux Klan. He spends some time attacking actual subversive groups - like the KKK, Aryan Nations, etc. - but he spends just as much time attacking the Republican Party and culturally conservative groups whose agendas have absolutely nothing to do with racism or subversion of the government. I appreciate the attacks on the KKK, but Chip's forays into attacks on the ""religious right"" just show he's paranoid."
5,Such difficult truths,"'If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear' - Orwell.Defensive and reactionary negative reviews of this book do not take away from the very relevant and necessary content of it. The fact that it hits a little close to home for some actually validates it, as the a authors argue (and rightly so) that dangerous right-wing populism doesn't just exist in so-called extremist neo-fascist groups such as the KKK (the KKK can hardly be considered a threat to anything anymore, mind you) and skinheads, but also in the back yards of suburban North America. It is now the American norm. Extremism as a mainstream ideology.Read this book."
2,Not great,"Sorry-- I don't know what people are raving about. I am an avid epicurean, and have gone to most good restaurants in NY. I just don't think Balthazar's recipes or food holds a candle to other NY institutions, like Gotham, Gramercy, etc. The food at and recipes from Balthazar always tastes a little too greasy and unrefined given how many steps are involved. Sorry, that's just my personal opinion after making almost ten of the Balthazar recipes."
5,A great great book,"If you have ever been to Balthazar on a Saturday night and had their Short Ribs and thought, ""if only I could make these,"" then you need to buy this book. It has all of the great receipes of the restaurant and are not too complicated to make. The receipies might be a bit spendy to prepare but beat the price of flying to NYC, booking a hotel, and trying to get a reservation at the restaurant before 11:00 pm. A great deal on the book as my local bookstore in Washington, DC had the book at $39.00."
1,Wish I could,"...but it's been back-ordered for about 3 months! Wassup, Amazon? It looks like a useful collection, and if I ever get it, I may change this review, but if you need the sound EFX, you better take your mic and recorder and get them yourself, because this CD probably won't be there before broadcast or opening night. I hope, like me, you have a carillon tower and a campfire nearbye!"
1,Skip this book. Read the Manual of Steel Construction instead,"In 1996 this was MIT's textbook for its introductory undergraduate steel design class (1.51). This text did touch on the most basic topics. However, I have been practicing structural engineering since 1998, and I cannot recall ever having found the answer to a question within its pages. I don't know that a better introductory text exists, but it's clear that the treatment of the subject is superior in the AISC Manual of Steel Construction itself. Have your students purchase the manual, but skip this text."
2,Not as good as I hoped. Thin & somewhat flimsy.,"I expected more out of these. The fabric is very thin & after just one washing and never used, they've already started with a small hole in the seam. That shouldn't happen and is not a sign of high quality.A plus is the lack of a tag-so no scratching. I washed & dried (low heat) in the usual fashion prior to first wearing, but I have to say, I'm quite disappointed by the quality. On inspection, there are a lot of redundant threads on the inside. Fit is good overall-but they run small. (flimsy) Not nicely made.Honestly, a six pack of cotton underwear at Costco is a better value, better fit & higher quality. ([...]) . I paid almost $20-$12.45 plus about $7 for Shipping & Handling. Not worth it! So I expected more. Hanes needs to find a better manufacturer"
1,Elastic Waistband,"Product description says ""Enclosed elastic waistband and leg trim"" but the waistband is NOT enclosed! I'm allergic so will have to return these."
1,"Wrong size, poor customer service","Do not recommend buying from this company.Hanes 6-Pack Cotton Hi-Cut Brief PP43Customer ordered size 6Company sent size 9Company won't replace, correct or refund order until we REORDER ORIGINAL PRODUCT and send WRONG order back at twice the cost of the original order.After two weeks of correspondence:Company ""cannot guarantee stock on orders that have not been 'plaed'.""Company still will not confirm they have the CORRECT size in stock.Customer comments:You're kidding!ORDER HAS ALREADY BEEN PLACED! MONEY HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID! NO STOCK INFO AVAILABLE??This is underwear, not rocket science."
1,"Never worked, returned it.","Let me first say I actually repair computers for a living, I work all day with software and hardware and I could not get this mic to work to save my soul. The mic would test fine using the audio test in Windows, but when it came time to use it in a program... nothing. No sound input whatsoever. Every setting was right, every input selection was right, the mic just wouldn't work. I know enough that if I spend 30 minutes staring angrily at my computer trying to figure out how to get a darn mic to work consistently it just isn't worth it. At least I could send them back!"
2,Stopped working,"I gave these to my grandson for Christmas and he was thrilled. He had no problems at all with the mic and used the set for gaming. Suddenly, the headphones simply quit working for no discernible reason. He's tried various things, including using them with another computer, but they have just stopped working. He started using them on Christmas day, so they lasted 45 days. I am not happy and would certainly not recommend this headset to anyone."
2,"Works fine, NOT USB, falls apart","This headset came up for a USB headset search, but it is not USB. It works fine, but the pad on one of the headphones came off and is impossible to get back on. They are only connected by a thin membrane of material that, as soon as you get one part on, the other part slips off. Its really annoying."
5,Great Laptop Headset/Microphone,Great find on the web was this laptop headset-microphone. I have the Magic Jack and the sound and microphone quality are great. I watch Hulu on my laptop and the sound quality is great there to. Future plans include recording some songs I want to sing and I think this multimedia headset with built-in microphone will meet the task. Great find.
2,A short cord on a fifty dollar headset?,"A headset for use with a home computer should have a nine foot cord. The system box is probably on the floor beside the desk, and the audio receptacles are most often at the back of the box, more than halfway down. The cord has to reach from the head of a man, possibly six foot tall, seated at the desk and leaning back in his chair.The manufacturer should be smart enough to know this, the distributers as well. With a $50.00 price tag the headphones should have been designed for comfortable use, not confining the home-user to sitting upright at the front of his desk as at a call center.Shame!"
3,Great while it lasted,"I bought these about 4-5 months ago and used them for WoW/Vent. Sounded great, very clear mic and headphones. Not very flexible, and gave me headaches at first, but eventually broke in. First thing to break was the microphone swivel. It just died somehow and the mic flopped around. I had to secure it with a rubber band. About a month later the same side earpiece started cutting out because of a loose wire where the wire hits the earpiece. Logitech headphones didn't last as long as these did. These also sounded better and people said I sounded clearer on these. So they won't last forever, but what electronics these days do last?"
3,One Month Mic,"While I read a few of the reviews before I purchased this product, I didn't have much problem with the comfort of the headset. Maybe I have smaller ears. Unfortunately, the mic quit working within the first month. I own a Vostro 1400 and the internal microphone always worked better then the headset. I kept the headset for a pair of headphones, but I don't recommend buying this product for the microphone."
4,Great for the price,"This headphone isn't as nice as my professional headphones, but, for the price, it's totally killer. Also, perfect for the office with the sealed ear pieces. It's hard to hear what someone else is listening to with these phones. It's true that someone with a long head will find these uncomfortable. It's also true that the materials are not the sturdiest. The mike level is a little low, but, it still works fine. I needed something cheap for the office so I could take my good phones home. So, I'm happy. We'll see how long they last."
5,This Product Is A Five Star To Me,This product is awesome it is what they say it is . It has great sound and the microphone works great too.Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!!!!!
5,Beautlful and Profound Rose Windows,"Painton Cowen's ""The Rose Window"" is a profound book that combines art history, mystical Christian thought, great beauty and sublime photographs. It is truly a work of art. It is a survey of rose windows: their origin, history, iconography, geometry and spiritual meaning. You will inevitably come away feeling uplifted and having made a significant discovery in your own inner life. I highly recommend the book in all ways."
5,Great book all around,This is a great coffee table book loaded with spectacular color photos. It is also a great study of the topic. Cowen is a serious and longtime student of the rose window who has well organized his copious material and presented it all in a manner that is informative both to scholars and to the broader public. I can't recommend it highly enough.
5,great gift,"It's a great quote-a-page-book which will make you, your family or your friends, begin each day with a smile thanks to positive quotes and cute illustrations!If you like Mary Engelbreit's work, you will love this book!"
3,Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad...,"Mimic 1 is one of those movies that I can watch over & over; good acting, decent plot, etc...so I read the reviews and ordered the sequels too. Mimic 2 is okay, but not as good as the original (the fate of many sequels), but Mimic 3? Very disappointing! As one of the original ""scaredy-cats"", afraid of her own shadow, I was left unmoved by this movie. I'm not sorry I bought it because at least I have the first two Mimics, but may give away the third; it's not worth watching again."
3,Still no anamorphic release for Mimic,"While my expectations for the treatment of the second two films in the Mimic trilogy were not particularly high, it was my hope that, in the 13 years since its initial release on DVD and 14 since its theatrical inception, the original Mimic would finally at least be given an anamorphic transfer to appease my upscaling DVD player and ensure that watching the film without windowboxing (black bars on all four sides) would be a possibility, but this was apparently not a consideration. As a result, the set is no more impressive than the initial DVD release of each individually with no additional features to speak of. Any hardcore adherent of the trilogy will likely be appeased with all films in one inexpensive set, but the DVD aficionado will remain wanting for something worth owning not on DVD. Overall, extremely unimpressive."
5,Just what you'd expect,"Yet another great novel by Patterson. As usual, from start to finish, it was hard to put down!"
5,Enjoyable Summer Read,"Great book, couldn't put down - great summer read. In typical Patterson fashion includes some twists, etc."
3,Lifeguard,An enjoyable summer reader. Just what I would expect from James Patterson. An entertaining story.
2,Too Unrealistic and Predictable,I have read many of James Patterson's books and generally enjoy them.....except for the annoyingly short chapters. With most chapters only being a couple of pages long the books are generally about half as long as they appear. This book is just too unrealistic and unbelievable. Too many things happen which just can't possibley happen and I just can't get into the book.
1,Page Flipper,"Seems like a book written by an amateur, not a successful and well-know writer.Totally uninteresting and predicatable. Characters are not the least likeable. Plot line boring and formulaic.I ended flipping pages in order to get to the end. Finally, I just trashed it."
1,FBI Agents fall in love with serial killer suspects every day,"Listen up, everyone. FIVE STARS means a classic masterpiece: Catch-22, World According to Garp, Deliverance, Catcher in The Rye, Old Man and the Sea. LIKE THAT. Just LIKING a novel doesn't mean you give it five stars, okay?I liked a couple of the early Alex Cross novels but this Lifeguard thing is absolutely absurd. I only read it because I'm interested in ""Florida"" novels but this one should have been set in California, it has no Florida quality at all. MOREOVER, the FBI vets their recruits a lot better than this. It's ludicrous. As for the people who are giving this commercial pablum five stars, they can't read many books. Try something by James Lee Burke or Henning Mankell if you want to read a really good crime novel, something by Carl Hiaasen or James W. Hall if you like a good Florida novel. Honestly, around the entire Amazon website I'm finding one thing. Write any piece of commercial garbage and someone will give it five stars."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I borrowed this book on audio cd for my 40 min drive to school. As it progressed, I found myself open-mouthed, often sitting in the parking lot (or driveway) listening. Sometimes I question how people get these reading gigs... but Billy Campbell is AWESOME. This book would make a terrific movie. Don't be surprised if you see it soon."
2,Is this really Patterson?,"The key elements of the plot have been covered by others. Indeed, the overall plot is pretty engaging. The book is quite short -- fairly large type and a lot of white space. I read it in a single day.While the plot is entertaining, the writing is pretty sad. Some of the writing is so amateurish that I found myself physically cringing as I read it. I'm assuming that the book was actually written by someone else. Patterson seems to be trying to cash in by putting his name on this stuff. I'm not looking for great literature here -- just a good, entertaining read. I really don't blame Patterson for trying to maximize his return from his reputation. For me, though, this is bad enough that I probably won't bother with his future work."
4,Satisfying quick read,Classic plot with twists and turns I expect from Patterson and this genre. Short chapters. Good plot speed. Engaging characters. Glad I picked it up.
3,It's O.k,"This book is not one of James Patterson best. It will hold your attention because your curious to find out the ""who, what and why"". If you have alot of time to kill or bored and don't have anything else to read this is a good book."
4,Audio CD Review; Always Good,"Another good read (listen) from Patterson. Good narrator, with skillful, smooth delivery of the story. And then there's Ned Kelly. One must love this guy. Just remember to leave your garage door up when you pull in and can't stop listening, you wouldn't want to be overcome by the fumes!I recommend listening to this one, along with the Alex Cross series and the Women's Murder Club. Also recommend Robert B Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone series."
3,Lifeguard,It was the most exciting first part of a book that I have read in a long time. After that it became simple and unrealistic writing. I was extremely disappointed that a book that started off this good could end up so shallow.
1,What a waste of time,Surely one would think Patterson was successful enough on his own and would need to lend his name to lesser works which this is clearly. He has struggled with the last few Cross novels. I wish he'd spend more time on those endeavors
2,Disappointing!,"As a long-time fan of James Patterson, when I pick up one of his books I expect the writing to be tight, tense, and of page-turning excitement. This book was a poor representation of Patterson's work, which leads me to believe that while he might have come up with the plot line, his co-author did the actual writing. A tone of intensity and urgency are always part of Patterson's work, and it is sorely lacking in this ""fake"" Patterson novel."
2,A Patterson novel without page turnability???,"Interesting storyline but clearly Patterson tried to turn out the next ""Dan Brown"" novel. All the elements of a good story are present but they are set out in such a formulaic way that boredom sets in. This book lacked ""page turnability"" which in my opinion is Patterson's greatest talent."
1,lifeguard,Predictable -- boring -- two words i didn't ever think i would use fora Patterson book. he can't seem to equal his first few novels. i give up. won't waste my money on any more of his novels.
1,Don't bother,"Why Patterson lends his name to these substandard books is beyond me. The story didn't work, felt like it was slapped together and didn't engage me."
4,Lifeguard,It was a great book! It kept me in suspense the entire time. easy read great event and character description by author.
2,Disappointed,"The only ""Patterson"" I found in this book is his signature short chapters. The book is short, the print is large and the chapters average about three to four pages long. Obviously a reader could finish it off in a night, which I did. But it wasn't because I couldn't put it down.I found the characterization horrible. The characters were so flat and boring. How can a guy who came so close to receiving his MA be so gullible, air-headish, and stupid? Or an up and coming FBI agent so easily believe a total stranger even when ALL the facts say something different? This can't possibly be Patterson's writing. It sounds nothing like his earlier books that so easily captured the actions and thoughts of a complex character. I don't think I'd bother with another of his co-authorships again."
2,"Cheaply written, easy read","This is definitely something I wouldn't have finished if I weren't on the beach. The characters are flat, and the inner dialogue is cheesy at best. It might make a decent movie but didn't fly as a book. At least it was a quick read - I read it in a few hours - but it's not in any way believable. Also I didn't really care what happened to anybody in the story."
2,At least I didn't pay $14.99 for it,"To put it nicely, this is not Patterson's best work. The story drags on and on and the characters are unrealistic. An FBI agent getting mixed up with a murder suspect? Yikes."
2,Not one of his best,LifeguardI have been hooked on James Patterson for years. This was not one of my favorites.
3,ups and downs,This book was good but i wouldn't call it a best seller by any means. there were parts that were page turners but in between those parts it was kind of boring. the main character was young and stupid in most parts and that got a little irritating. its a good book for a rainy day or by the pool but nothing i would run out and buy.
3,just ok,"As a huuge James Patterson fan, this one kinda disappointed me... sure it had its moments where I was glued to the book like white on rice... but it being a James Patterson book, I guess I just had higher expectations for me than it was able to fill."
3,Amorette,I liked the book very muchI would rate it five stars. When I tried to press 5 stars my kindle stopped me from tapping it on the symbols
5,"Nice, unexpected twist","As always, James Patterson surprises you with a few twists and turns, characters are well described, storyline remains interesting throughout....Beautiful, righteous ending..a must read for all of his fans."
3,It's ok,"I like his other books better, but that is just my opinion. I am an Alex Cross fan. Patterson has ""Beach Road"" and ""The Quickie"" to name two, that are out of his regular genre."
1,Ugh.,Maybe it's just me...I have now read 3 Patterson novels. I have figured out the entire story well before the end and only read the rest to make sure I am right.I'm not reading any more of them. I give up.
4,Enjoyed the book - a definite page turner.,I greatly enjoyed this book -- it is not the best one written by James Patterson but it was very good. I would recommend it.
3,Not sure what all the hype was about,"I thought Lifeguard was just okay. Patterson has done much better work. There were a lot of editing errors throughout the book, which was distracting and it takes away from the quality of the book. The plot of the art heist gone wrong is a unique one, which leaves the reader wanting to know whodunit, but that was it for me. I found it hard to get into at first, and then once I was into it, I thought it dragged in some areas. I prefer the Alex Cross series and the Women's Murder Club series. I have found that when Patterson deviates from those series, the result is hit or miss. The 2 exceptions are The Jester and Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas-both great books! One comment on another reviewer's remark about the accuracy of Ellie's John the Baptist reference. Perhaps the CD version worded it differently, but in the book, Ellie says she can shoot a disciple in the Last Supper painting. I don't recall a specific reference to John the Baptist."
3,Nothing special...,"Lifeguard is a typical Patterson book. Short chapters, a fast read, but nothing memorable. I finished this one a couple of weeks ago and honestly cannot tell you a single thing about the book. It's books like these that really make me wonder why I keep reading Patterson..."
1,So This Is James Patterson??,"Let me begin by saying that I could not put the book down! I really needed to find out how it ended. Having said that, this was a horrible book because it asks too much of the reader to suspend disbelief. FBI agent falls for the suspect and is willing to trash her career for him? Really? Among other things this is what we are being asked to accept?"
4,"Liked It, Get Past the Start","This is not a James Patterson book, it is James Patterson with someone else and I had not read one of these before.The first few pages had me thinking that I had made a mistake, I was pretty unhappy with the initial set up of Ned and his friend. The scene just felt very awkwardly written.But I decided to continue anyway and pleased that I did because after the initial lull the book started rolling from the moment the heist goes bad and bodies start appearing. Not quite up to Patterson's other books and sometimes the characters seemed a bit TOO much, such as the rich art owner and the female agent sometimes seemed a bit unreal, but in the context of the story some of that is to be expected.It ultimately winds up being an overall fun read. If you have not read any of his books before you probably would also like to look at ones such as Along Came A Spider to get a better sense of Patterson."
3,LIFEGUARD NEEDED SAVING,"Have not read James Patterson for a few but this was entertaining. Brockton Massachusetts is indeed a city with shabby clapboard houses with sagging porches, most of them 3 story. I got the feel of the city and Florida as well. Ned Kelly was an adorable loser but I wouldnt want my daughter to marry him. Ellie was sweet. I liked her character very much except her judgement of men! :DI loved the short chapters for which JP is noted. It makes you think you can read just a few more and before you know it, the last chapter is before you. Story was entertaining. Most of the male reviewers are seemingly demanding more. However, this story intrigued me enuf to finish to the end, which was over the top. Oh well, all's well that ends well."
4,Lifeguard,"As is typical for a Patterson/co-author novel, it will move at a fast pace and you'll most likely get it read in a couple days. The novel is both satisfying and quite entertaining. As mentioned by others, this novel is on par with his others and should leave most Patterson fans happy and looking forward to his next (which I'm sure is should be out in a month or so)."
2,"A ""Gross"" Mistake","Patterson and Gross failed to save this reader from drowning with their novel, Lifeguard. Characters are underdeveloped and hardly believable. Not consistent with Patterson's typical page-turners."
2,"Will the REAL Patterson, please stand up!","As someone who was Patterson's biggest Alex Cross fan, it saddens me that Patterson's books are chart-toppers because of the Patterson brand. I still read the Cross series - I guess, considering the last Cross read was, Cat & Mouse.I just can't wait for the Patterson I was introduced to when I was in my teens, to stand up & take his place on the bestsellers list for quality not quantity. Sadly, I believe he may have been a 3 book wonder.Anyway, I pushed myself through it because I am a fan of the gifted Mr. Gross & it was painfully obvious (to me) which segments were penned by the fervent Mr. Gross. FYI: Gross is w/o a doubt HERE TO STAY!!!I am hoping Patterson will emerge again in this century, but I am not going to hold my breath."
3,Passable,Patterson has many people writing for him. He puts his name on the book and it sells. This book is okay. People might not buy it without the Patterson name on it. But this will stay on bestseller because its a Patterson.
2,Two Authors Of a Work of Fiction Are One Too Many,"Over the years, I have become a fan of James Patterson. Nevertheless, in very recent years, like Tom clancy, he has been putting out books with his name and the name of a second author. I find the two author books less gripping. Perhaps it is a prejudice of mine. I wish he would stick to the Alex Cross type stories which I believe he wrote by himself."
4,Patterson franchise thriving,"The James Patterson franchise is thriving. Like Clive Cussler he uses co-authors to spin out yarns under his name. At least they are given credit, unlike some others. Lifeguard is one of the better recent Patterson novels. The plot is well summarized in another review here. No point in repeating it. There are more twists and turns in this novel than on a rollercoaster. Ned Kelly is taken for quite a ride. He loses one gorgeous babe to murder but ends up sunning with former FBI agent at the story ends."
2,Not Much There,"I started Lifeguard not expecting great literature, but with James Patterson as a co-author I looked forward to an imaginative and entertaining story. Unfortunately, Lifeguard fell way short as it proved to be shallow and formulaic cotton candy that can best be compared to a mediocre, cliché-ridden ""Made for T.V."" movie. Those of you looking for entertainment on a beach or a plane should reach for a different book."
2,Boring,I was very disappointed by this book. I am a huge fan of James Patterson and I read almost all of his novels. I had been anticipating the Lifegaurd for months until it came out. I began reading it and was immediately disappointed. It was boring and flew right into the action before any character development. I hope his next one is much better.
3,Good for Gross; Bad for Patterson,"It's hard to rate this as a Patterson novel. I wish he'd just take his name off the cover and present it as it is - a novel by Andrew Gross. There is nothing in this book that is the signature of Patterson except the choppy chapters. My boyfriend, a college professor, looked over and said ""if my students handed in a paper with a font that big I'd fail them.""Don't chop chapters just to do it. There was one where it ended and the next chapter picked up right after the last sentence. Pretty ridiculous. It's like the typesetters were given an allotment of words per chapter and told to snip it after that number was reached.Anyway, the book was good, but not Patterson good. Should I say ""early Patterson"" good. He hasn't been writing like his ""Kiss the Girls"" days in a while. I hope Andrew Gross knows that he's proven himself and can start publishing under his own name instead of riding on JP's coattails."
2,What's Going On?,"I seldom write a bad review, my motto being if I can't say something good...well you know the rest. In the case of LIFEGUARD, I am compelled to state that I am extremely disappointed.First, I'm a big big fan of Patterson's and usually devour everything he writes. However, last year, I must admit I merely put up with The Lake House. I didn't love it but I easily forgave Patterson and understood his need to try something new.LIFEGUARD did not cut it with me. I'm waiting with baited breath for the next Cross book, Mary Mary. He never goes wrong with the Alex Cross series."
1,Worst,"This is one of the worst books I have read in recent memory. The main character is so shallow, and says such banal things, that there is no way anyone would fall for him. I can't believe a reputable author could put out a book like this, unless marketing says that the majority of the public likes simple stories aimed at 16 year olds. It IS true that it is easy to read, but so was my 1st kindergarten book. I'm not planning on ever wasting my time on this author again."
4,Quality,"Thank you Amazon! Enjoyable, with the actors that I favour, they are excellent at their craft these are the movies I can watch several times over and still enjoy."
4,DVD is NOT letterboxed!,"I love this movie--it's one of my all-time favorites. Since the plot has been discussed in other reviews, I will only address the DVD quality in mine.The only reason this movie does not get 5 stars is that it's not letterboxed. Full-frame movies on DVD are almost the exclusive domain of children's films, so why Columbia thought that the devoted fans of this movie would not want widescreen is beyond me. I have noticed on the web that this movie is in widescreen in England. What gives, Columbia? I have contacted Columbia by e-mail to express my displeasure and encourage the film's fans to do the same at sonypictures.com. Except for the chopped-off framing, the picture is very good: clear, sharp, and detailed with only very occasional and very minor artifacts. This is a wonderful picture and we're fortunate to have it on DVD since it was not a big money maker, but the studio needs to hear from us so they won't repeat such a stunt in the future."
3,One Great Love Story,"Thank you Columbia for finally releasing ""84 Charing Cross Road."" It would have been better if you had released it as the director envisioned it in wide screen. This is one of only a handful of films that I would buy no matter what screen proportions they are issued in (UNTIL A PROPER PROPORTIONED FILM IS RELEASED - as Helen Hanff would say). A marvelous love story via the postal services across the Atlantic. Read other reviews for the story line. A nice crisp, clean DVD. Widescreen would have gotten to two more stars from me. Come on Columbia be true to the director's intent. At least give us the option between widescreen or full frame."
4,"84 Charing Cross Road, Beautiful Movie","I really enjoyed the movie, ""84 Charing Cross Road"", starring Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft, two great actors. I was interested to see these two keep up a correspondence of something like 25 years or so, and yet never meet. That was the sad part of the whole movie, the fact that the man dies before Helene ever has a chance of meeting him. Towards the end of this film, it starts to drag, but it leaves you with such a good feeling that somehow you can overlook this and remember the good moments, which there are plenty of."
2,Unbearable,"Based on all the good reviews, I decided to watch. Ugh. I tried, but I couldn't even finish the movie. I was bored out of my mind. And I have a real problem with characters speaking directly into the camera and breaking the 4th wall - it's a cheap trick. Turns out I don't like Ann Bancroft either, or at least I didn't like her character or the way she played it in this movie. I love books, too - but could not even like this movie."
3,84 Charing X Rd,Unfortunately I was expecting the BBC version of this - though this is my fault for not looking at the deatils carefully enough. This is an american version of the BBC production and falls far short of the feeling created by the original.The DVD delivery & service were great - would buy stuff from these folk again - no problem there
3,Lost Opportunity--where's Pinter when he was needed,"This is a nice movie if you are the bland sort and only superficially into literature; if you are expecting anything pithy or deep or profound or edgy to be said about literature, you will be disappointed. Even a bland, Republican, high school english teacher would get deeper than the dialogue allows Bancroft and Hopkins. Imagine the feast if Pinter had written the screenplay!! But if you thought Field of Dreams was authentic, sincere, and a walloping good movie, you will like this smarmy, sadly lame film."
4,84 Charing Cross Road,What a great way to spend a Friday night. This movie was such a delight to watch. I totally love Anthony Hopkins and he was perfect for the role of Frank. Thanks so much Amazon.com Prime for the great selection of movies to occupy my evenings.
4,A small gem,"This delightful tale of a 20 year correspondence between a New York writer and a London bookseller made me smile a lot. There is more to it than that, but that's the net result. The movie is better than the book, but by all means read the book first, it's a fast read. The book is the actual correspondence on which the movie is based. Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are perfectly cast, as is everyone else."
3,Good acting - not much of a story.,"The movie is based on the book of same title which is a simple assemblage of letters between Helene Hanff in NYC and a book seller in London in he late 1940's and early 1950's. Although the letters are a charming read, there is not enough to support a film. It would have been better to watch these three great actors just do a reading of the letters."
5,A TRUE LOVE STORY,"This will always be one of my favorites! I have never said ""raspberry"" without ""drawing"" it out as the English do since I saw this movie. You can't review this movie . . . you simply must ""live it"" as you watch it. Anne Bancroft's best and Anthony Hopkin's close second to Shadowlands. An incredible book lover story! When you hold a first edition hereafter, you will treasure it as Anne Bancroft did. You will raise it to your lips and kiss it; you will smell and caress the leather . . . and, when you go to England, you will look for the store. This will be a favorite for your lifetime."
4,"Terrific Film, Terrific Book: Buy Both",If you love books you can't go wrong with either the book or the film
4,"Well Done, Delightful","This quiet, early 1900's movie is a sweet story of friendships that are forged over a lifetime through correspondence from one side of the pond to the other built on the love of common things--books. The sweetness is in the ordinary people and their ordinary lives adding richness and kindness to the places that all of us find ourselves living and working. It is a case for ""goodness and kindness matter."""
2,84 Charing Cross Road-Poor DVD but Great Movie,"I've given this charming movie 2 stars because of the treatment it got on DVD. The movie itself deserves 5 stars.Columbia Tri-Star did a real disservice by releasing this movie in pan and scan mode and not in the format as it was shown in theaters. If you remember at the very beginning of the DVD the words ""This movie has been reformatted to fit your television"". So in reality, you viewing a heavily cropped out movie.I won't give a descriptive review of the movie as others have done so quite eloquently here.A quiet and magical movie that deserved far better treatment on DVD. Shame on Columbia Tri-Star."
2,"This movie did not meet my standards, it was boring.","Not a very good production, I just watch part of the movie. It story was not of interest to me."
5,Two Book Lovers Form an Enduring Friendship from Across Two Continents,"Helene Hanff is a writer and lover of Shakespearean English literature. In 1949, she begins corresponding with bookseller, Frank Doel of London, to acquire antiquarian books she cannot find in the U.S. A lasting friendship ensues over many years and a great distance. The two form a deep bond over their love of books. A charming story."
5,One good film!,"This is a very well made film! It has such a nice story and makes you think. This is my favorite Anne Bancroft film! She gives a very honest performance. Hopkins is just as good, and fans of Silence of the Lambs won't believe what a nice guy Hopkins can play!"
5,A beautiful book,"This book is a favourite of both me and my two year old son. The beautiful, detailed pictures capture the essence of summer and the magic of being a child, when any activity can be transformed by imagination into something more. Many aspects of beach life are shown, from playing in the surf, to wading in rockpools, to a moonlight bonfire. The verse flows well and complements the pictures, although I would agree with the previous reviewer that the illustrations are the highlight. I love all of Alison Lester's books, but I would rate this one as the best."
2,Mei Mei too slow,"I realy loved Mei Mei's first video and thought I would love this one, but it is too slow. The words just are not natural sounding. Like teaching someone to say cat, by teaching them, ""cccaaaattt"" I think saying it once slow is enough, but she needed to say it normally as well so that someone doesn't ty speaking like that. It was kind of a joke at our home to go around speaking like Mei Mei. However, for someone just begining who has never once heard spoken chinese, it would not be bad. For video #3 though, it needs to be faster."
1,Like a good book gone bad...,"I'm Southern and love books about Southern women, but this book left me irritated. It started well then went downhill from there. The plot jumps around so much, it's difficult to figure out where you are in timeline or with which character. I skimmed the last few chapters just so I could say I finished it. This is one of the few books I've ever read in which I didn't like ANY of the characters. It's poorly written; Ms. Bruckheimer cannot seem to make her characters and scenes come alive without use of similes. The result is a work that reads as if written by a high school sophomore. I was disappointed!"
2,Would not have finished it - if not for my book club,"I thought the author tried too hard to be funny and it just wasn't working for me. It kind of reminded me of a slapstick movie (I know some people love that stuff but not me).This was chosen as a book in the book club I attend. I really don't think I would have finished it otherwise.I am not ""Southern"" but if I was, I would be insulted by how so many of the characters were portrayed (complete imbeciles). I can't believe that the people in Kentucky or Tenessee are that dumb."
1,"Great idea, awful execution","I enjoyed the novel's theme of progress vs. preservation. Having been brought up in both the progressive world of Orange County, CA, and a town smaller than Blue Lick in North Carolina, I can understand where the ideas of the book came from. However, I found it to be a painful read. The storyline jumps around a lot, and there seems to be some irrelevant information intact as well as relevant information either completed skipped, or alluded to only at the end.If I had it to do again, I would skip this book. I think it needed a lot of editing before being published."
1,DON'T BUY FROM BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES!,I purchased the AlcoMate Breathalyzer from BP Medical Supplies here on amazon.com. After paying $95.00 for it I was shocked to see what I received. They sent me the breathalyzer in a case with NO manufacture's box or let alone instructions. The battery compartment came damaged. For starters my item arrived late. When I emailed BP Medical about the item they emailed me back and told me to call the next day. I called no one answered and I left a message. No one called back. So called back and left more messages. No answer and no call backs. I filed a claim with amazon. They finally instructed me to return the item. BP is still stalling and I have to push my claim further. This has been a horrible experience. I have been an amazon.com customer since 2003 and buy lots of things here. I have only had only great experiences until now. STAY AWAY FROM BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES!
2,"good, but...","Works OK. but the battery was lasting for few weeks only . It was a generic alkaline battery probably made in China, and was discharged below 3.5 Volts while unit was shut off. It could be combination of two things: poor battery - which is for sure, and something in a system inside is ""eating"" a power while unit is shut down - which is still possible. Anyway, too early to give a good rate for this product"
4,A great collection of Tucker Tunes!,"Back in the early to mid 70's, Marshall Tucker was a true ""Road Warrior"" Band! It didn't matter who they played with, from the Allman Brothers to Three Dog Night (yuck!). They just wanted to get up on stage and let loose! This collection of songs from their early years gives a great testimony on why they were so popular, even without many ""hits"". The highlights include live performances of ""24 hours at a time"" (with Charlie Daniels on fiddle) and ""Can't You See"". The low points are including the single release version of songs that were wonderful in the long form (This ol'Cowboy and Heard it in a Love Song) when the album versions were SO much better. Overall, though, a excellent collection, and a must buy for Tucker fans!"
2,Marshall Tucker Radio Edits,"This would be a more appropriate title for this collection of hits. This would be a great album except for the fact that the two most famous songs, ""Heard it in a Love Song"" and ""Can't You See"" are the radio edit versions of both. The live version of Can't You See is quite enjoyable and of course is the long, album version. With the exception of the two radio edits, this is a great collection."
3,"Not bad, but a bit too melodic in parts","Not owning their earlier albums probably puts me at a disadvantage when reviewing this one. Having said that, this cd is a good listen. If you have heard their first single ""From The Sea"" from the album ""A Song Is A City"", then you probably know what this album will be like. The album never really hits its stride on the whole, with several songs sounding very similar and samey. However, ""Black Fingernails, Red Wine"" is in itself a great track and almost worth the purchase price. Others, such as Sarah, Suicide Girl and Pressure are certainly not terrible, but are not up to that standard.All in all, the album is a solid enough listen. The best advice I can give you is that if you enjoy U2, Coldplay, Dashboard Confessional then you will recognize a similar sound here. Listen to the single ""Black Fingernails, Red Wine"". If you like this song, then you will most likely enjoy the rest of the album. If not, then it is probably best to stay away."
5,The best pictures and story of Buenos Aires,"Truly great picture postcard photography of the 'Paris' of South America - Buenos Aires, tango, great food, neighborhood coffee shops, wide avenues and beautiful peoples, most everything you'd what to see, everywhere you wish you had time to visit, all in a book at a really gerat price."
2,broken feet on lineman,the lineman came with the foam packaging broken and feet had to be glued on before I could give it for gift.
1,It never worked,I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews for this product. We were never able to get the machine to work properly and then had to pay postage to send it back. I will certainly think twice before ortdering this type of product over the Interent again.
3,No bells and whistles,It does fine as a call screener ... the sound quality of the caller message may take getting used to.
1,dead speaker,"Extremely poor sound quality -- but at least that was better than no sound at all. It worked for less than two months, then the speaker completely died in the middle of playback. As far as I know, the machine is still recording calls -- I just can't listen to them. And the remote feature never worked, so I can't listen to messages that way either. This was the first AT&T product I ever bought, and I'll never buy another one."
1,Horrible!,"This thing has the worst sound quality I have ever heard on an answering machine. 9 times out of 10 I can't understand what the caller is saying. After reading the previous review I thought that maybe I had gotten a lemon, so I tried a second unit which was just as bad as the first.Save your money and buy something else."
4,"So far, so good...","I just bought this today (not here unfortunately; needed it ASAP), and it is pretty much plug and play. I noticed that several reviewers had sound concerns. Interestingly, the package says ""excellent sound quality"" in no fewer than 3 places on the box, so I wonder if it's been ""tweaked.""Anyway, the sound is good, love the features. My only concern after 25 minutes is that the microphone is on the bottom of the unit. It didn't seem to make a difference for the memo function, but I was unable to record my outgoing announcement until I picked the unit up and spoke into its hindparts. There is no mention of this in the manual.We'll see if it holds up to actual use. Its predecessor, an AT&T; 1337, lasted over 10 years."
5,White Trash Recycled yields gold !,"This re-gathering of the White Trash is a super energized, funky, bluesy reunion of some great musicians. Super quality production still holds up today. Jerry Lacroix and Edgars voices and sax playing lite a fire under the music and listeners backside. As always, so incredibly tight and well arranged music. This is not Edgar leading the band, but Edgar as an excellent musician and singer along with all the rest of the band. ""Shake it"" is a great tight funk-blues song which features the excellent soloing and musicianship of the band.....This'll have you movin' in the livinroom!! Edgar - quality music and a quality guy as well!!"
5,Great Album White Trash Rules,"I just received the cd and i love it, quality isnt bad better than the vinyl skipping version that someone transfered for me to cd LoL. This Album has everything going for it rock blues the Jazz, horns the Drum beats awesome cd, i actually like this one better than the first White Trash cd which i also boughtGet it it rocks"
4,Nice Product,"This scan converter works as advertised. I am impressed with the picture quality for a unit in this price range. I use it to dispay digital pictures from my laptop PC onto my HDTV in 1080i mode. The only down side is the interlace mode of 1080i makes the display soft. Since my TV does not do 720P I was not able to appraise that mode, however I believe that it would be sharper than 1080i because of the progressive scan."
1,Why do these things break so often?,"And the worst part is that they are not available! You would think that Netgear makes these dongles so vulnerable to make a business replacing them at ... a piece. But they are so hard to find! I guess they want you to buy a new card. But if you bite that bullet, why would you buy a new card from them? Sounds to me like marketing geniuses. Too far ahead of their time to be understood."
3,good army builder,"Compared to the other clone troopers, this one isn't much. Unlike the basic clones, this guy is made from cheaper plastic and has less articulation than it's counterparts, #6 13 points, #41 14 points and this guy only has 11. What I didn't like was the lack of wrist articulation, without it you limit the number of cool ways to pose this figure. The jet pack launcher is a nice feature, except that it dosen't really work. Still, the spring open wings are great and so is his rifle. Even though this figures not so good, he's still a decent army builder, plus these sell rather quickly. This clone isn't really a must buy figure, but it's still a good addition to your collection."
5,Great!,"This was my first Rammstien video experience and it was spectacular! 5.1 format was ok, could be better, but just from watching you could almost feel the energy in the air as if you were there. It is well worth having in your DVD collection, and I would recommend any fan to acquire this DVD!"
4,Almost The Next Best Thing To Being There,"As a recent convert to the awesomeness that is Rammstein, I was thrilled to see ""Volkerball - Special Edition"" was available through Amazon. While I still have to take the time to watch the second (documentary) disc, the concert dvd and audio cd alone were well worth the price. After watching this collection of performances it only makes me wish (more so) to be able to see them live. The reason I gave it four stars as opposed to five is that I have to agree with other reviews listed here in that I wish that there weren't so many audience / crowd shots and rather that they (the producers / cameramen / whoever) would of focused more on the band throughout. Musically, it was practically flawless (I know diehard fans have made comments stating otherwise but for me, it worked) and I consider this 'special edition' as one of my new favorites and would highly recommend it."
3,volkerball review,I purchased this live dvd but was informed that these were all region 0 versions which means they will play anywhere. When I got them they wouldn't play on any of my main dvd players but it would play on my xbox 360.
5,Rammstein's Volkerball,"I'd known about the group Rammstein for some years, but only started listening and reading about them in the last year. Turns out that I'd been missing good stuff for awhile. The Volkerball DVD is one of the best concerts/shows I've ever seen! The music is tremendous, the camera work killer and the editing is great. The guys really put out a great show as the 2005 concert in Nimes France shows. Some may say ""but they sing in German"", I say ""so what"" good music is where you find it. For those who really want to know what the guys are saying should go to ""http://rammstein-europe.com/main.php?sekce=lyrics"" (minus the quotes) for a side-by-side list. As I understand it, they are recording a new release in Los Angeles, and I'm sure to get it when released."
3,RAMMSTEIN VOLKERBALL FIRESHOW-OFF,"SOUNDTRACK A DISAPOINTMENT IN DOLBY DIGITAL. SOUNDS BETTER IN PCM STEREO.GOOD PERFORMANCE ON STAGE.THE DRUMMER IS EXCELLENT AND THE REAL STAR OF THE SHOW.THE MACHINE LIKE/MINING/FACTORY WORKER LIKE APPEARANCE OF THE BAND,A REAL HIT.FIREWORKS A LITTLE BIT OVERWHELMING AND SOMETIMES TOO MUCH. CROWD PARTICAPATION AWESOME. 5 STAR SHOW. 2 STARS FOR POOR SOUND IN DD. 3 STARS OVERALL."
5,Absolutely the best book on this subject,Now Goldbach conjecture is a $1Million question. This book is the best possible book to learn about the subject with the available progresses. The author himself has proved towards the final goal. Highly recommended.
5,An Excellent feel-good CD,this CD is a rarety. You can listen to it again and again and never get sick of it! Every track is good - there are no weak ones.A must buy! Especially if you are familiar with Scott Grimes'acting works i.e. Band of Brothers and ER.
2,For people who are not fans of Scott Grimes,"If you are a fan of Scott Grimes' acting career, then you will be impressed by this CD. This young man is indeed multi-talented but unfortunately this album does not showcase his talent to the fullest. If you're not a fan of Mr. Grimes, then this album will seem rather ordinary to you and your money would be better spent elsewhere on bands/artists that do this sort of thing better. The album tries too hard to be more than it is. You can tell that they were going for 'meat and potatoes' rock 'n' roll and ended up with something more like 80's excess. The songs are catchy and entertaining but I would never say that I would want to listen to them over and over again as some have previously stated. It's an okay album with nothing really brilliant about it. It's a good effort and fun in a lot of ways. I liked Sunset Blvd the best. If you've got money to burn, give it a try, but you may just want to buy one or two of the singles."
5,Relaxing and Enjoyable,What great music. Brings me back to the age of music when I could understand the lyrics. Wonderful variety of sound and tempo.Listen to the CD a few times - and you will be hooked.Enjoy.
3,Isn't he an actor?,"Ok, does anyone else think he's trying to be the new Jon Bon Jovi?? Cuz that's what it sounds like to me. Only he's missing the band."
5,Best CD I have ever heard,"When listening to Livin On The Run by Scott Grimes, I found it to be the most inspiring music I have ever heard. I have heard that he writes all of his own music, and that his music actually has to do with real life events. I would reccomend this CD to everyone I know, and have done so. My favorite song is the one called Around and Around. Makes you stop and think about life. I hope to hear many more CD's from this artist, and I will follow his career closely."
5,The next Rock and Roll Superstar is Scott!!!,"This is one of my favorite CDs. Each time I hear it, I find something new that I like. What is even more amazing is to hear Scott perform it live. He is one of those rare performers who sound even better LIVE! This is music that makes you want to fall in love, go on a road trip and just hang with your friends."
3,Great Fun!,His music is reminiscent of fun 70's music that uplifts you and is great to sing along with and perfect for road trips! Loved him on ER and was amazed by his voice-neat discovery!
3,GREAT DRAWINGS AND INSPIRING,THE BOOKS COLORS REALLY CATCH THE EYE OF THE VIEWER. I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE BOOK'S WRITTEN BY THIS UP AND COMING YOUNG WRITER AND ILLUSTRATOR.
3,Disappointing,"OK, I know things have to change, but the title of this book shows how far off the path this series has gone. The ""War"" is a distant no-show in this book. Instead, sigh...we get relationships. I will say this: let Oprah explore relationships and give us good sci-fi. I couldn't believe all that you-me stuff going on between Vaemar and Dimity while they were supposed to be fighting the supposedly near-invincible Pak. And the fact that Vaemar almost said that he loved Dimity! That was just too syrupy for me. If the Kzin weren't so interesting, I would have put this one down after the first two stories. Well, I would've checked out Mr. Niven's offering, because it is easily the best in the lot. IMHO...wait for the paperback on this one."
3,Skip the Hal Colebatch stories,"Niven, of course, is great. How did Hal Colebatch get included. He knows nothing of soldiers or professional warriors, and his depictions of such are just stupid. The first story almost made me chuck out the whole book. I'm glad I didn't but honestly, Colebatch must be Niven's nephew or something. He can garner zero credibility for action/adventure-type sci-fi. His characters and their relationships (huh?) are really shallow. But if you like to read about people doing one stupid thing after another to cause their own demise and then pulling through due to even more stupidity on their part, you'll love Colebatch's stories. Better yet, skip Colebatch's stuff and read the good ones."
5,great hooks and lots of melodies,what can I say? this forgotten gem is an real party starter! all awsome hooks all allong the way! if you ever get the chance to get your hands of this one. BUY IT!
1,This thing is a piece of crap,"There is no excuse for this piece of crap. Why would anybody buy this? There is nothing here that matters, just a bunch of party songs, I can't tell you which one is worst. I would rather listen to Poison!"
5,English As A Second Language,I am a tutor in an advanced English as a second language class. Students at this level have a terrible time understanding American idiomatic phrases. This book meets their needs quite well. The examples of the correct use for each idiom is particullarly helpful. Its relatively low cost is a major plus since these students are usually struggling financially.
1,Don't buy this CD-ROM version.,"I bought this CD-ROD version. When I execute program, it always require CD-ROM insertion. I cannot use ths program without CD-ROM. And the design of the program is out of date. This CD-ROM was made in 1999. And even worse, the developer of the CD version program( VERSAWARE) was out of business. So I cannot update the program. I regret buying this CD version dictionary."
4,Good Pet Pen,"We bought this pen to hold our West Highland White Terrier puppy. It's setup is very simple - just align the pieces together and insert four rods in the corners. It's light, but fairly sturdy. For a small to medium dog it's a nice little pen at an affordable price."
4,Nice and Strong,"Compare with the soft crate I have, this is much stronger. With the soft crate, my dog destroyed the zipper to find it's way out.The wood frame matches my solid wood floor and does not leave any acratch marks.I would give a 5 stars if the pen comes with a bottom pen"
3,"Love the look of it, wish it came with a top though","I was very excited about this kennel and couldn't wait for it to be delivered. It is fairly lightweight but sturdy, and the wood trim looks a lot nicer than the big bulky plastic ones. The only downside is that my Yorkie puppy (6 months old), hopped out the top immediately. We have tried various ways to create a top to this, finally ending on a big piece of plywood covering the top. Now its far less attractive. So be careful if you have a yorkie... apparently they can jump (or climb) pretty high!"
3,not well constructed,"The Can-Cell's wings don't fit flush against his body. The wings come separately and you have to push them in, but there's a pretty big gap between the body and base of the wing. It looks pretty fake. While I bought this item for a steep discount, I found myself more than a bit disappointed at the basic construction. If not for that, it would look pretty cool."
5,Where did this music go?,"This album has attitude, fast rich guitars, and his vocals are unheard of in today's form of metal. The music is heavy and fast, yet at the same time very groovey. When Metallica left the building with the black album, Sacred Reich still pounded out great music."
4,great metallica style thrash classic,sacred reich has allways stood for great thrash this cd was an instant classic in 90 with funk inspiration from faith no more/chilli peppers.but mainly heavy crunchy thrash guitars and could easliy stand in the same league as metallica at the time in 1990 after all the drummer tried out to fill dave lombardo of slayers drumm kit 87 with kerry king approval but the band felt he didn't fit in so well?I have not heard this remastered version of the cd but the original is still vital in my cd collection today!
5,Eladio Dieste's Scientific Design,"This is something unusual in the field of building. A book that describes in detail how technical innovations can be both poetically and environmentally friendly. The voice of underdeveloped Countries is distinctly heard in the soft tones of Eladio Dieste architectural works. As Holderlin once wrote: ""full of merits but poetically dwells Man on this Earth."""
1,Lasted about one week,"I pulled the trigger on this oil switch because it was a third of the cost of one at Napa or Autozone. Unfortunately the switch only lasted about a week and now the idiot light flickers over bumps and when starting the engine. I can predict whether or not the light is on just by looking at it and it's connection. I would not recommend buying this product but I will admit that it's possible I got a random lemon. I also bought an O2 sensor on Amazon and that failed immediately; different seller, different product, same cheap outcome."
1,Like the Maginot Line,"In about two days my squirrels had figured out this little chestnut. They hung upside down, marked the feeder and used their paws to scoop out the seeds. This was Birdfeeder Cracking 101 for them. On my model the top wasn't even secured, which might have been a problem if the front door wasn't wide open. This ended up in the trash fast, where it probably will for you if there's any squirrels within a square mile or so of your house. Do what I did and buy the Heritage feeder instead, still working like a charm after 6 months: Heritage Farms Absolute II Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder."
2,squirrel watcher,"Opus Top Flight Fortress bird feeder IS A SQUIRREL FEEDER.It's not squirrel proof.The squirrels love it and are on it all the time, so that the birds can't get on. The top screw lid is weak and easily pops off so squirrels get down in from top too. They are cute however hanging upside down and pulling the expensive black oil SF seeds out of the bird feeder holes while the birds sit in adjacent trees watching.I thought there were laws against false advertizing?"
5,birdfeeder,"Counting the two new Top-Flight birdfeeders I just purchased, I have had 4 of these feeders. Got rid of the two I had (after 3 years) because I could no longer get them really clean. I enjoy these, they are easy to fill and the birds like them. The only downfall to these feeders is they do collect some water at bottom. A baffle over the top cures this."
3,Dry and Uninspired History,"In some of my reviews I have used evaluations such as ""scholarly study"" and ""academic history"". This book is solidly in that camp. Sadly it's a very dry and uninspired history of the development of precision bombing capability by the United States Army Air Corp and Army Air Forces over the period noted. The data and evaluations and observations are all no doubt valid and of great interest to the serious aviation and military historian, but it took much determination on my part to get through this book. Only recommended for those who really, really want to study this subject."
2,The Legendary Norden Bombsight,Mr. McFarland needs to read the book The Legendary Norden Bombsight to get the full picture and history of the Norden. This book was published by a person that worked on the bombsight and managed the bombsight shop before and after World War II. This is the first book to detail the Norden Bombsight (NBS)
4,A small but effective tiller,"This tiller deserves 4 stars or a little better. You will get annoyed if you try to use it for too large of a job, but for smaller jobs you will love it.The best description might be savage. It finely churns up packed dirt and even clay into well aerated soil and I've even seen it start churning it's way through bricks that were hidden in my garden.The tines do tend to get clogged with weeds fairly often if you're starting from sod, but if you're retilling a bed from last year this tiller is quick and efficient.All said, I would suggest renting a big tiller for a day if breaking a lot of new ground. The small size and tendency to get clogged will make it take quite a while with this little tiller. Otherwise this works extermely well for any other purpose that you would use it for."
4,Mantis tiller/cultivator,"Good power for a smaller machine - so far been great for tilling smaller portion of hillside project - try manhandling a large machine on slopes! Dethatcher/aerator combo work really great too. The assembly instructions/manual could use some improvement - some steps in assembly have only very small pictures illustrating how things are supposed to go together, and instructions aren't as thorough as they should be on all of the controls. The deficiencies in the manual are the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review. Buy it, and once you figure out the rest (left out of the instructions) you will be very happy!"
3,beware! you have to put it together,"Mantis website advertises, that all you have to do is take it out of the box, fuel it up and you are ready to till. But buying the product from this site, you have to put it together (Not the engine) and there must be a thousand pieces. If I can figure out how to return this free, I would return it and buy elsewhere. The product is probably great, but putting it together sucks!"
5,It just keeps chugging along,"I am getting ready to order my second Mantis tiller, because I let my first one go with the house and business there. I had that Mantis for 13 years. I used it to tear up an old blacktop driveway - ruined the tines - which Mantis cheerfully replaced free of charge. It never had a service call. It never failed to start. Every Spring it was ready to go. Is it a ""wild animal""? I guess so. Tilling isn't for tots. The Mantis just gets down there and digs. Yes, roots get caught in the tines. But a lot of them just get cut to pieces by the super sharp tines. I'm skeptical of the electric version because I had such fantastic luck with the Echo engine."
4,Mantis Tiller,"I purchased this item as a gift for someone else. I did assemble and test run the tiller and watched the operation of it in the hands of the new owner. The tiller performed very well both in tiller mode, and with the edger attachment which was included. Engine runs great, and everything functions as it should. I did not give a 5 rating, as the powerhead arrived crooked (which I adjusted) and there should be a better way to attach the control cables to the handle bars. Also, I agree with another reviewer on the subject of the choke knob. A little too tight a fit within the engine shrouding to easily grasp the knob. Overall though, the Mantis works great, and the Amazon price could not be beat."
2,Disappointed,"The Mantis arrived fine and was shipped promptly by Amazon. I have about 1/4 acre and was attracted to it's durability, handyness, and easy storage. The first time I used it, I hit a small piece of crab grass which got tangled up in the gear area so I had to stop, take it apart and remove the grass. No matter how I adjust and operate, weeds get wound around the gear drive. The Mantis is also not easy to operate. The video shows by pulling back on the Mantis it actually works better but it pulls [...] your arms. I am disappointed and I think that the ads over promise. I am sorry that I purchased this product."
5,Awesome! I just regret I hesitated so long,"This little machine is GREAT! I needed something to help me clear out my overgrown yard in Michigan. I read so many reviews about the Mantis Tiller but just couldn't believe it would work that great. My yard is pure clay and hasn't been taken care off for 7 years. They offered a good deal with a one year satisfaction warranty (or full refund). So I tried it and, believe me, I wouldn't take the refund! This is a great little workhorse. I am an average-sized woman and I have absolutely no problems maneuvering this tiller. It starts fine if you don't set the choke too high. It is very light and not very hard to move since you basically pull it back and forth like a vacuum cleaner. It turns compact soil much better than my neighbor's big equipment. I've owned it for two years and really think it is one of the best purchases I've ever made!"
4,Terrific tiller!,"I own 2 Mantis tillers, 1 is about 12 years old and still works great. No, they are not for breaking up virgin ground, but for tilling out weeds and getting real close to established plants without cutting root systems, it can't be beat. Easy to control. Parts and accessories are expensive. (felt air filter - $[...])"
1,Recent purchase unreliable,"I purchased a Mantis 2-cycle tiller about 18 years ago and got a good 15 years of use out of it. I purchased a replacement last year and got one year of service. I have experienced so many frustrating problems I have given up on it and am looking for another manufacturer. Typical problems: hard to start, loss of power, running rough and quitting. I suspect newer models are subject to shoddy manufacturing and/or materials."
5,Beyond Expectations,"I was so skeptical when I ordered this Mantis tiller. It is such a mini and I did not expect what I got when we got it into the garden. It worked like a charm in my raised beds. My husband and I both are so pleased with this product that we are recommending it to everyone we know that does any kind of gardening at all. Our soil is not the easiest to work, especially initially, as we are on the bahada of a mountain range with rocks and some clay, but this little jewel stood up to the challenge and never missed a beat!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this machine 04/25/2008, and it stopped working two weeks ago. I took it to a local dealer and got it back last week. It ceased to operate again. I used this tiller once a year primarily for dethatch and aeration. It's fair easy to start but very hard to control speed. This tiller is definitely not good for a yard over 1/4 acres."
1,This tiller sucks and that is being kind.,This tiller ran well the first year and stopped. My husband took it to a tractor sales place for repair and was told they get these tillers in all the time for repair. Buyer beware!
3,Mixed thoughts...,"This is not a bad product, but I'm weighing how I feel about the automatic earthworm avoidance technology vs. the beaver-skin grip uphostery which I have some ethical problems with. It tills well and is easy to maintain, though as a word of warning I think they could have been a little more clear that pressing the blue button located behind the root seperator causes the entire unit to blow apart in a shower of hard candy and gum. I called tech support and they indicated this was part of the documentation. Read the fine print!"
1,Died after 15 min. COULD NOT RETURN ! ! ! !,The product failed after 15 min. of use.COULD NOT return to Amazon.Amazon will NOT take returns of gasoline machines.Local 'approved service agent' was not happy to service engine.(Since I did not buy it from them.)This machine failed again when I brought it home.Amazon buyers: beware of purchasing motorized products that use gasoline from Amazon. They can not be returned.
1,Mantis tiller,"I have had my Mantis two cycle cultivator for about six years (who knows why). Every spring and fall I pull it out to cultivate a small garden, work on it for several hours, call Mantis to remind them of the trash they sell and till for thirty minutes before repeating the process. I have rebuilt the carb., replaced fuel filter, lines, etc. and replaced the carb. Always the same thing, unreliable. I really like the weight and how handy it is, but by the time I'm done with the garden, I'm ready for a drink or a bullet. The drink for me or the bullet for either one of us. Every time I call Mantis, they have two solutions. One: Send it back and we'll fix it for $200.00 plus shipping or ""Go ahead...make our day"". Since, if you think about it, neither is a viable option; I think I'm going for the Stihl cultivator. Can't beat the reputation or the reviews."
1,Mantis tiller/cultivator performance...,"I am sorry my husband purchased a Mantis for me. I tried to use it several years ago. Now it just sits in the storage barn. I hated it mainly because I could never get it started, even when I took it to a lawn mowing dealer. He had a problem too then once he got it started, told me I would aways have a problem because I was a woman and not strong enough to pull the cord. Also it does not do the job it is advertised to do. The sick part is that he spent a lot of money for nothing and I would like our money back please. Unfortunately my husband died and I am still stuck with it. I WANT OUR MONEY BACK! There! Now I finally said it now that I have a computer to say it with... Most sincere gratitude in being able to express my opinion,wish and request....In all honesty, I feel took!Counselor Counselet"
4,great digging,"I had a similar tiller (different brand) so I was familiar with the strengths and limitations. The Mantis performed well and seemed to dig deeper and faster than my other one. My only complaint is that when I was tilling and trying to move it around, I kept hitting the cutoff switch. This was quite aggravating because then I would have to start it all over again.Other than that, it did a great job."
4,Mantis 2-Cycle Tiller #7225-15-02,"Works great in breaking hard soil.....not a very good edger...maybe that is why the edger attachment was free. Only ""chewed"" the grass...didn't really remove or cut it."
5,mantis tiller cultivator,"This product proved to be all that is was advertized to be and more. For a moderate sized garden it is an excellent investment and could be used on a big garden also, especially to cultivate."
5,Very satisfied with Mantis tiller,We are very happy with our new Mantis tiller. It is light weight and easy to use.
2,NOT belkin - GENERIC!,The cable is acceptable but it is NOT belkin. They sell a generic and try to pass it off as the name brand and it's not! I had the exact belkin cord in a shorter size and this is obviously a knock off.. the construction quality doesn't even compare.
3,NOT Belkin,"Cheaper build quality than Belkin, and was not shipped ""snagless"" version by Parts Express, so I cannot review that feature. Cord feels flimsy and easily breakable. I'll just have to be careful with it."
1,NOT Belkin--and do NOT buy from Parts Express!,"I worked a decade in the technology field, including as a purchasing agent, so I know my parts. I also developed caviar taste and a willingness to pay extra for quality, which is why I buy Belkin snagless cables. I wish I'd seen the comments here before I placed my order--or trusted my instincts that no one could sell Belkins at this price. What I received was, as others have said, clearly NOT Belkin. It was just a cheap, knockoff cable of the sort I could make myself if I was in a bind and really needed to.The cable arrived in a laughably big box, shipped via Fed Ex. I guess you can afford to ship so inefficiently when you're ripping people off. I contacted Parts Express and demanded a return, and I was told I'd get a shipping label immediately--though why they'd spend the money on a return for such a piece of junk defies logic. So far, I've not received one, so I've turned the matter over to Amazon.Buyer beware..."
5,Belkin 50' Ethernet cable,"Good product, great price, fast shipping.An equivalent Cat-5 Ethernet cable cost a LOT more at the local electronics stores.Buy this if you need one, you won't regret it."
2,"Hmmm, not much here...","I was hoping for more of an updated version of one of Ed Burns Vagabonding books. This was a bit annoying and preachy with little substance, but always a good topic, and not much out there on this kind of travel."
4,A great resource for getting into that frame of mind.,"I bought this book and I'm about halfway through and loving it! This definitely isn't an in-depth approach to traveling long-term so don't buy it thinking it is. It does, however, get you thinking in the right frame of mind in regards to long-term travel. It's basically a philosophical approach to the concept/idea of traveling abroad. The quotes littered throughout are perfect anecdotes to go along with the passages in each chapter. And all the resources are great to get you started with planning on your own. The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because by the time I started reading this, I realized I knew a lot of the info already from years of research into my own trip. But it's definitely worthy of your time and money if you find you need a little push to get you started."
4,wonderful book on long-term travel,"A terrific read - either for the armchair traveler or those (like me) who are seriously contemplating a long-term travel adventure. Rolf breaks down all the BS excuses that we make for ourselves not to travel, and holds out the lure of learning and self-discovery. Highly recommended. The only reason the book didn't get 5 stars is that it's too short - not a huge problem - and the various quotes from other travel writers are distracting and not always helpful."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. But the unfortunate fact is that it's not very good. There's a lot of wishy-washy ""follow your dreams"" inspirational stuff, but very little practical information. The books and links listed at the end of each chapter are somewhat useful, but could easily be found without the help of this book. The author makes heavy use of quotations. Virtually every page has several lines quoted from another source. I can't help but think they're there just to take up space. It's as if the author was trying to reach a minimum page requirement. Overall I was disappointed."
4,Thought-provoking read on travel philosophy,"The concept of a minimalist living is one that I contemplate often. However, this book takes it a step further and applies the philosophy to travel. The author outlines avenues of thinking and a bit of structure for planning on how to experience the real cultures of other regions & countries.I found the book to be interesting and gave me pause for thought. As one somewhat strapped to a routine-based job that I don't necessarily love, it was fun to think about ""what if?"" ... however, this one will be put aside and revisited when it's a bit more realistic to travel the world with nothing more than a journal, a toothbrush, and a sturdy pair of footwear."
3,"Good...a quick read, but a bit light on material","I think the book is very good for inspiring and giving some very broad tips, but I was hoping to find more specific how-tos. He keeps referring to ways to live on almost nothing, but never really spells it out. Instead, he just mentions people who have done it. Otherwise, though, it's a good inspirational book about vagabonding, and it's a quick read. But if you're looking for concrete ""do this to survive in India on $5 a day"" you won't find it here."
2,Not A Good book,"This book is not worth the read. He basically repeats his self for a 150 pages. The main points are - go to places you like, stay there for a couple month and mingle with the local. Not an interesting read. The book has no heart. Rolf is lacking in the writing department. Not recommended."
3,Ok,"I had hoped this book would blow me away with wonderful ideas and new insights, but the majority of the stuff I already knew or didn't really care about. It did have some good resources for websites and other books to check out."
1,"If you've ever used your passport, then you do NOT need this book.","I'm in the process of reading this book and I am really not impressed. I wouldn't say I'm a vagabond, but I have traveled to 17 countries, so I thought this book might be good before I head out on my first long-term journey, but alas, it is a basic book for the beginning traveler. There is a whole section on how to and which travel guides to use. Isn't that common sense? Use the book you prefer, and don't follow it to the ""t"". Make sure to carve out your own journey.It does give good tips if you have never traveled with your passport before, but if you are in any way experienced traveling outside of all-inclusive resorts, this book is a waste of time and will not give you any insight to traveling that you probably did not already have. I'm not impressed as it got so many good reviews by people who claim to be seasoned travelers, but like I said if you've ever used your passport you won't need this book.Not impressed."
5,If you are going traveling (and not 1st class) get this book!,"I have not yet applied what I learned from this book, but it has inspired me to get going. Anyone can explore the world, and it doesn't take a lot of money."
4,Prepare to Catch the Travel Bug,"This is an excellent short read that every aspiring adventure seeker should add to their collection. Potts' puts the overwhelming concept of World travel into a perspective that nearly anyone with a level head can grasp. The book is not a step-by-step guide but will inspire you to travel on your own terms. Potts will make you want to get up explore the nooks and crannies of the Earth. I have passed this book onto two close friends already and they can agree. The bottom line is that if you are not the type of person that wants to spend years sitting in the same cube day in and day out and want to get out and experience other cultures, read this book, you will not regret it!"
4,Intresting,"I have barely gotten into the book, but thus far, it has proved to be an enjoyable purchase.We'll see if it actually does what it says once i start to travel.Right now, its time to make money for those travels, so we shall see."
3,Great if you're a serious long-term traveler...,"The author comes across as someone who's definitely ""lived what he writes"". The ""art of traveling"", and making the most of it by not carrying the ""tourist"" attitude with you, is good advice for living, not just those on the road."
3,"good inspiration, low on advice","I bought the Nook version. It is great for offering inspiration and for encouraging less-intrepid individuals to take the plunge. It offers little advice for actually achieving means or for obtaining in-country work. Also, the ""For Women"" is woefully under-researched compared to the rest of the book (perhaps because the rest of the book is from his own experiences)."
4,Full of Internet Resources,"I like this book. Rolf Potts has done a great job of collecting internet resources. The book is loaded with tips for a reader to build upon, and the book is more of a jumping off point than compendium of detailed information. The Rolf Potts Vagabonding website has a fully updated and linkable online version of the resource guide. The text of the book is full of general, useful tips for long-term travel and planning for life away from home. Any big trip requires a certain amount of research and forethought. While this book may not be the guide book I carry with me, it is a good one to include in the traveler's pre-trip reading list."
3,Old News for Experienced Backpackers,"I bought this book because I was about to set up on a backpacking trip again and wanted to read about more reasons as to why I should embark on my journey. I was hoping for powerful inspiration and motivation. But I felt that I read things that I already know, and the quotes and motivation not as powerful as some reviews claim them to be. But I am an experienced traveler and have backpacked for years and in different parts of the world, often alone. Perhaps this book will work wonders for those seeking to understand why this less traveled road should be more traveled. For those already on the road less traveled, I'm not sure if you will learn much that are new."
3,Good Product.. Bad Price,"The product is great. The shipping was fast. But the price is high! After it was too late to cancel my order, I found out that I could have bought this same product for five dollars less and I would have got twice as much product! Great. I paid five dollars to get half the quantity. Don't make my mistake. Research before you buy!"
4,"Not a miracle, but pretty darn close","Look, diet and exercise are always the key. Creams just help make up a slight difference, but cannot overcome genetics totally. The bottom line is that this cream works much better than most I have tried - even more expensive creams."
3,fun but small,i bought these for my girls who love to play with the blocks at school and their color and price although I was skeptic of the actual product. The blocks are rather small and my 2 year old wants to put them in her mouth and my 4 year old isn't to interested in them
3,Could be Better,"These look and feel fine, but I discovered that they are too small for our little one. I should have ordered larger blocks."
5,color building blocks,"Great toy for creativity! Doesn't break, require batteries, or move by itself! Great for a wide range of ages.Smooth transaction."
2,Let down for thos that like free roam,"This is a pretty good game. I was big on the freeroam. Not into the track racing. This game does not support it. You can't go tooling around off the tracks to just shred and do jumps anywhere in the worlds. Even in freeroam mode, if you venture off the track you get the 3 second warning.Other than that, it's your standard ATV Off Road Fury game."
4,A technical analysis,"I know linguistics are very technical, but it seems like the first half of this book goes a little deeper than necessary. As a psychologist, I'm personally interested in how people use language, not the tiniest details of how language is constructed. Although the first half of the book is (in my opinion) overly technical, the second half of the book does a great job of describing the empirical research regarding the use of language in discourse and conversation, its acquisition, etc. These are topics of interest to me, and the latter half did a great job with them."
2,Golden Years of British Comedy,"Regardless of the low price, this album is barely worth its cost. It is a collection of 2-3 minute snippets totalling little more than an hour, which is especially annoying when one realizes that the technology permits one+ hour per side. Accordingly, each snippet barely introduces the performers, when it at minimum it would have been possible to permit at least 4-5 performers to do more complete acts. And, to add to the frustration, most of the performers can not be found on other comercially-available DVDs, at least through Amazon."
2,Self-indulgent piece of crap,"I'm all in favor of silly, irreverant books, but this book is just so pointless. The author doesn't show any skill as a writer...it could basically have been anyone off the street making claims like ""I hate TV animals...but I love Salem the cat from 'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.'"" This book reads like a stream of concious exercise done by a ninth grader.Who cares?He doesn't say anything really interesting or eye-opening about why he does or doesn't like anything. For his analysis of ""Full House"" (which he loved), all he did was sum up the show, then claim it wasn't self-important. And, as some others have written, some of the items seem to contradict each other. He loves the ""loamy schlock"" of ""Full House,"" but hates the ""corny, artificial""-ness of ""The Brady Bunch.""Once again, WHO CARES?"
1,"OK, Bill O'Reillys Great","and Edward R. Murrow was a hack. Trying to be provocative without backing up your opinions is downright pathetic. Among other mistakes, this book praises O'Reilly for the EXACT SAME reasons it insults Murrow. A waste of 20 minutes at the bookstore."
1,What a piece of garbage.,"This book is badly written, badly edited, and badly in need of being tossed in the garbage...Which is where my copy is now."
1,One of the WORST,"It's probably hard to sink much lower than Television Critic, but Tucker's way out of his element. He has no concept of many of the Basics of Drama. Things like Tone, Voice, Pace. He simply rip-roars through The TV world - comparing world-class writing like Aaron Sorkin's West Wing with the dreck spit out by Aron Spellings (...)-factory. Tucker is in way over his head in this lowest of the lowest jobs."
2,About what he says on Barney Miller,He says Linda Lavin was on BM as was Barbara Barrie but that neither made it to the show's second season. Actually both were on BM during it's second season. BM started in early 1975. Then it returned in the fall of 1975 for it's second season. Tucker apparently wrongly thought the 75-76 season was the first season of BM. I as a good Christian found BM way too sympathetic about gays. Tucker only feels it made fun of gays. But we both agree gays were among the show's problems.
3,"Summary of a large collection of articles,","The book starts with basic theory such as lipid structures and carbohydrates. However, it focuses on bioenergetics, receptor and responses as well as membrane fusion and flow.The book is more or less a summary of a large amount of articles. Theories are stated and experiments are provided to prove them. This may make it difficult for some readers to understand the overall concepts of a chapter. This book needs to be more illustrative to qualify as a good pedagogical example. In contrast, if you are looking for different experiments illustrating the molecular biology of membranes, it is definetly something for you. It is a book from 1993 so it lacks some of the latest theory, but the book is worth reading if you are interested in membranes and their proteins.The book is written for senior undergraduates or graduate students in their first two years. It is definetly not a beginners book since assumptiopns of background knowledge are made."
4,good headphones bad stereo adaptor,It was a present for my husband.I give it less than five stars because 6.3mm stereo adaptor that comes with it sometimes loses contact and cuts out sound.I do not now if I got defective one or it's just crappy in general.It's not a big deal but small and seemingly insignificant glitches like that can spoil overall product experience.I would not buy this brand again.
5,Awesome,"You may think they're pricey, but you get what you pay for and these are superb headphones. I highly recommend using an amp (like a FiiO) if you're using these with a laptop or ipod. It makes a big difference - allows you to get the most out of them. Also, the sound quality is only as good as your music files - recommend 320kbps or higher."
5,Nice,You get high grade headphones without having to pay for the name brand tag like Dr. Dre. Well worth the money best sounding headphones for under 300
3,"Good sound, but not sure its worth the price.","Pretty good sound quality. Some sound leakage. This product doesn't claim to have noise-canceling technology, but I wish had noise-canceling because I can easily hear external noises such as people talking. Headphone are very, very comfortable around the ears. I would have felt better about these headphones if I would have paid around $[...] bucks."
3,Great Headphone with one huge issue,"I got these about a week ago after being unhappy with the noise canceling feature in some other headphones. I tried the HD 595 and loved the sound quality and comfort. They are amazingly comfortable, but then my roommate pointed out that he could hear my music at the same level I was! I bought these to use in the library and out in public to avoid disturbing others and vice versa. In addition, there is not much of a noise cancelling capability. If you want something comfortable with which to listen to music in the privacy of your own home, then these are probably great. But caveat emptor."
3,WTF,"Just a heads up, theey have speakers on the outside of the headphones. Sound is not consealed AT ALL. anything you hear, your friends or the person sitting next to you can hear"
1,4-eyes beware of this model!,"I have a major gripe with these headphones: I wear glasses, and headphones can often be uncomfortable until I break the padding in a little using them with my glasses.These headphones were more then uncomfortable with glasses, they were painful. After 2 hours I decided trying to break them in just wasn't worth it, as I removed them one of my glasses lens snapped from my frame. The amount of force these headphone pads put on my glasses makes them unusable.Without glasses the HD-595's are perfectly comfortable. As other reviews have covered adequately these are excellent mid-range headphones for audiophiles, but DO NOT buy them if you wear glasses!"
4,Oh my STARS these things are good!!,"I practically ripped these things out of the box when they arrived the other day. They felt so good on my head that I was half way down the street with them before I realized I had forgotten my MD player. Frankly, I was at first disappointed, thinking the music sounded ""good but not great"" when I noticed the swaying cord dangling around my feet...A short while later back in the west wing with a glass of chardonnay and P. Diddy blasting through my 595s I felt it was all worth the steep pricetag. I'm still sending them back because the cord is all stepped-on and scratched up, but I whole-heartedly recommend these excellent set of cans."
5,HD595,The headphones are more than I expected given their cost. I'd recommend them to anyone in the market looking for a quality set.
1,2 pairs. Both failed left driver.,"I have two of these earphones. I bought one, used it for about two years, then the right driver started crackling...then the left simply failed.Bought a 2nd pair because I loved them that much. Guess what - left driver is now dead on the 2nd pair."
4,Sennheiser HD-595,I think these headphones have a great sound. The only thing I don't like is they don't seem as comfortable on my ears as a previous set of Sennheiser's I bought. Maybe I just need to use them a little longer to sort of break them in.
3,"Great sound, poor construction","I've always been a big fan of Sennheiser earphones, but I may choose a different maker next time. The consistent problem with Sennheiser is that the cord leading to the phones eventually starts to fit so loosely that you have to jiggle the cord to get any response. And then, over time, the problem worsens until you do what I did once in a fit of anger - throw the dang thing across the room. I'm trying to control my temper this time, but the problem is a major distraction from the generally excellent sound of the earphones themselves. Too bad Sennheiser is apparently unable or uninterested in fixing this flaw."
3,Not for me,"After reading many reviews I ordered Sennheiser 595s from Amazon. I had used Sennheiser in the past and loved them, but the 595s disappointed me. Even after a 24 hour break-in (which helped) they sounded dry, polite, and mellow, with a lack of presence and detail. I listen to a lot of live acoustic music; everything from string band to classical and these headphones just did not deliver the beauty of what I've heard in person or the sound I knew to be on my CDs. I returned the 595s and bought Grado 225is which I love and have reviewed as well.BTW my headphone testing has drawn my attention to the huge differences in sound quality of various computers and devices. In short, the sound from my Iphone4 and Imac are very spacious and detailed though the Imac has a warmer sound; while the sound from my expensive Samsung laptop is brittle and two dimensional. My next audio purchase will be a DAC."
4,Really impressive,"Several reviews of this item have rated this as top tier especially for it's price, which should be 185. Very comfortable, extra long cable length, it's really insane how long the cable is. Comes with very nice packaging, accessories include a headphone holder that you can attach to a desk or similar. Has both 3.5mm and full size stereo plug. Excellent quality, has great dynamics, very detailed. Not for full bass, it is lacking in some bass, it will be noticeable as stated in reviews. This is extremely accurate though and works very well with portable devices, aka does not need an amplifier, but of course can take advantage of one if used.Recommended at 180 price point"
5,Great Sounding Headphones,"This was my first new pair of headphones in quite a few years. They were a replacement for a 25 year old pair of AKG K-240s, My last pair of Sennheiser headphones was a pair of HD-414s which still work great after 30 years of use. I have always found their products in general to be very high quality. The sound quality with these is excellent listening to any type of music, excellent flat frequency response, good clean bass and very crisp highs, and very comfortable."
5,"Heavenly sound, heavenly comfort","I purchased my Sennheiser HD-595 headphones after carefully researching the topic on various headphone web sites and reading various reviews, including the user reviews on Amazon. They all seemed to point to one thing: If you want the most comfortable, best sounding headphones, go with Sennheiser. They were right! I couldn't be more pleased with my HD-595 purchase. I use these when practicing piano late at night. I use a MIDI keyboard plugged into a set of multi-gigabyte sampled, software-based grand pianos. With these headphones I'm hearing gorgeous, rich timbres from these pianos that I've never heard before with any headphones or even with my speakers. And they're so comfortable you forget you're even wearing them. I highly recommend them, unconditionally!"
4,Great headphone in a private place,"Pro: Great sound quality. Greater mid for excellent vocal performance. Very stylish.Con: A little lack of bass and high. 1/4"" plug instead of 1/8"" plug.Other thought: Compensate for it's open-can design, it has huge sound leakage and there is no isolation at all. It has terrible cabling IMO, thick and long wire(.2"" by 10') and gigantic plug(.5"" by 4"")."
4,headphones,"Was not real happy with these,I guest because of not very much bass.Everything else was ok.I just received my Sony extra bass mdr-xb500 and could not be more happy."
2,Poor Workmanship,Not gonna get into how these sound except to say they sound great. I have no problems with the audio itself. However at this price we should really be getting better build quality. I bought this on Dec 9th 2010 (so around a year and 2 months) and the left side `handle' that holds the earpiece breaks off from the main headpiece. Huh? How come? I treat all my things very well. This headphone even sits on the stand that comes with it when not in use. Even before this happened I saw a hairline fracture on the left side of the gold portion that houses the earpiece. (that happened about 6 months ago...hopefully it does not get worse.)Honestly... this headphone seems to be made with one specific purpose; to get the consumer to upgrade to their pricier (supposedly more sturdy) models. The guys in marketing got me this time... don't let them get you. -__-2 stars... but only because it still works and sounds pretty decent. How long that will last I have no idea now.
1,amazing sound- but you may need an ammp,"I have the HD-580's and mt review says it all, amazing. But I just want to reiterate, YOU NEED A DECENT HEADPHONE AMP to make these reach the depth of your musical soul. 99% of amps (and all MP3 players) amp will NOT provide enough juice to get these speakers sounding as they were meant to be heard. Like putting a cheap amp with high quality speakers in your car. waste of $$. A home amp sends minimal power to the headphones as opposed to high power to the speakers. Find an amp with power to teh headphones as opposed to a preamp outlet. Cranking the volume may make them sound high but not deep and rich. There's a difference.and DO NOT buy these for a portable player or real small home stereo."
2,Expected more,"Unfortunately, I had a great pair of Dr. Dre but I used them with my phone and I lost them. I wanted to replace those with a set that was more comfortable with my glasses. The Sennheiser HD595 did just that but the quality of sound is no where as good. When used with my TV, they need the FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier. I suggest that if you don't have an eyeglasses problem, get the Dr. Dre."
1,BUYERS BEWARE! must read,"Ok, so i got the Sennheiser HD595 after reading all the reviews. As most people gave it a higher review, i thought they might actually be a good pair of headphones. So in a few days i got them and saw how badly built they were..! And then i used them, and was even more disappointed. *They only have good sound if there is NO background noise and if you crank up the volume really high!!!* Does not hold in sound.. does not keep out sound. And the comfort is awful too. I returned them the day i got them.Instead of these i would very highly recommend theV-MODA Cross-fade LP Over-Ear Headphones (Gunmetal Black)Extremely stylish, amazing sound, can wear for days and built very well. Buy these instead!! They are around the same price range and much much much better!"
3,"Good, but not spectacular sound","They're OK I guess. I guess I just expected more for 250 bucks. They sound better than my 10-year old , $40.00 Koss headphones, but not 6 times better.. And yes, I DID burn them in, playing my CD on repeat for hours on end; but again, not an appreciable difference. Incidentally, I was only replacing my Koss 'phones because the earcups are deteriorating: they still sound pretty darn good!On the positive side though, the Sennheisers are very comfortable, seem well-made and hopefully will last a long time. They do not isolate sound transmission to the outside though, so if that is a concern for you, you might want to look elsewhere.Overall, I wish I could give them 3-1/2 stars; 3 sounds too low, but 4 is definitely too high."
4,"Great, but not for the casual user.","I wanted a pair of really awesome headphones to play my music in my room with. I was willing to drop a lot of money for a good quality set of phones that gave me the best sound. I'm kind of pleased with them. They are open, so everybody around you can listen to what you are hearing. But the sounds quality is still impeccable. Really incredible. It's a little strange and different sounding than Bose because they are so open and you can hear everything around you.I think they're worth the $175, and they do as advertised. They're a good buy and the deal can't be gotten anywhere else."
4,headphones sound great,"I bought these headphones based on the stellar reviews. The sound quality is really good. Very comfortable. They don't really block out ambient noise as much as I hoped, but then they're not noise-cancellation either. As to build quality, there's some ""plasticky""ness about them, so handle with care. Overall, I'm very satisfied for the price."
5,Sennheiser HD595 .......Unbelievable !!!!,"I've had Sony's, Koss's, and some earlier Senn's, and this one is the best so far. I would even go as far as stating it's the best sounding, lightest, highest in overall quality can set I've owned. It's by no means cheep price wise, but if you can afford, you won't regret it. I now own a second set of HD595's for my computer listening pleasure. Just check out the specs (I'm a tecky), the frequency range would make any dog sit up and howl. I've got perma-grin! Enjoy"
5,Excellent sound and comfort,"I read many reviews before getting these since few people carry them in stores for people to try out. My biggest concern was getting a big, full bass sound, and these headphones are excellent. That being said, they can't match external speakers with a subwoofer that shakes your chest. The midtones and highs are excellent as well. They are so comfortable that, at times, I've even forgotten they were on. I prefer the ""open"" style as it doesn't totally cut me off from the front doorbell ringing or the kids calling to me if they need me, but they still block 95% of all external sound. I'd hate to have ""closed"" headphones in a building that was on fire... These are great - highly recommended."
5,Sennheiser HD 595 Headphones are TERRIFIC!,"Comparing other headphones in this price range to the Sennheiser HD 595's is like comparing other recent U.S. Presidents to Ronald Reagan. Sorry, but there's just no comparison. These headphones are simply fantastic. No, I'm not a sound engineer or a studio producer, but I am old and cantankerous and know more than most people. Buy them .... the part of your brain that processes music will thank you forever."
2,Left ear went out,After a little over a year the left ear went out. I expected more from these headphones. I am contacting Sennheiser to see if it is still under warranty.
2,Ripoff. Get the HD-555,"These headphones are exactly the same as the HD-555.The only difference is a piece of foam in the HD-555 which cripples the sound.You can open them up, take out the foam, and instantly become a HD-595.Don't believe me? Check the thread on headfi dot org for the differences.You'll find a picture of a replacement part showing that the drivers are exactly the same.For instructions on how to do the mod, check youtube.As of December 2010, the price difference is about $60.The 595 does come with a nifty headphone holder.I'm not going to return my 595s because I like the headphone holder and then the difference in price isn't really worth the hassle.But if I could do this over again, I would get the 555."
4,"Very, very good but...","I like good sounding headphones although I wouldn't say I'm an audiophile. I enjoy music, I don't dissect it. I primarily listen to rock. These are excellent, easy to drive phones. And very comfortable.Why 4 stars and not 5? The Senn 555s are almost as good (SQ and construction) and much cheaper. And, although it's not as well made or accurate (or comfortable), the $69.95 CR60 Grado's sometimes have a more fun, punchier sound.If you want the best Senns, get the 650s. Chances are you'll buy these and then want the the 650s so why ""waste"" money on these now. The sound signature is a bit different (these are a bit more front row) but the 650s are better and plenty satisfying, even for rock. Only caveat --- one would need a headphone amp if using 650s with an IPOD. Get the 650s, a headphone amp (total bithead/airhead for $99.00 or something a bit better) and a SIK line-out. You won't believe how good music from an IPOD can sound."
5,excellent headphones,"I bought these headphones to watch movies late at night and to listen to music. They are very comfortable and great sound quality. The long cord is a big plus to plug in to the receiver across the room and sit in my easy chair. I have other Sennheiser headphones that I use for my ipod that are noise canceling and they have been great so I thought that I would take a chance on another set of headphones from them. I have not been disappointed. As I read in another review before I purchased these headphones, there will be noise that can be heard from these headphones and that is ok since they aren't noise canceling. Again, the comfort is great and the mount for holding the headphones is a nice feature so you can place your headphones in a special place. A little pricey but I have learned that quality might cost a little bit more. They are worth it."
3,Excellent Sound but Terrible Build Quality,"Can't say much about these headphones that hasn't already been said. They are the BEST-SOUNDING, most 'accurate' pair of headphones I have ever owned. (But I've never paid more than $200 for headphones.) They are also the most COMFORTABLE.However: BE WARNED, THE BUILD QUALITY IS CHEAP!!!My pair of HD595s began to develop cracks in the casings attaching the cups to the headband just a few months after purchasing them. This is from normal use. My headphones have never left my apartment. For a pair of headphones costing $150 - $200, this is unacceptable.TERRIBLE BUILD QUALITY !!!"
4,Great Headphones at a Great Price,I bought these as a replacement for my son's headphones. He's destroyed several sets from varying manufacturers over the last 3 years and more earbuds than I care to mention. I didn't have a good idea how big these were when I purchased them so I learned to my dismay that these badboys really AREN'T for portable devices. I was going to return them or sell them used when I found out my sone was using them almost exclusively when hooked into his mother's laptop. He said the sound was superior and they were very comfortable. He uses them for hours at a time. I'm not sure if he's taking these to college with him this fall but I hope not. I want a chance to use them myself at home...Da Worfster
4,good,good staff. shipment is fast. look not that fashion. Price is a little bit high but acceptable. worth buying it
1,Disappointed,"I owned Sennheiser headphones for years. They finally gave out, so I purchased these headphones. They just arrived and I am beyond disappointed. My old HD 457's had better sound and were much more comfortable. This pair hurts to wear, and any time you move your head, you hear the fabric and leather from the headphones over the music. Thankfully, I got them from a company with a fantastic return policy. Back they go, and I'm finally going to get the old 457's fixed. Should have done that to begin with. Live and learn."
3,"Great phones, too much leakage!!","I purchased these headphones for my son for Christmas. All the reviews I read had put these in the 4 star category. I always like to read the 1-2 star complaints before I buy. We received the phones and were excited until he put them on and we all heard the music my son was listening to. They had a great build quality and feel. Large comfortable ear muffs. My ears didn't sweat. But alas, extreme sound leakage. No way can you take these with you on a plane, bus or train. People would tell you to turn the music down or off. We found some Bose at a local wholesales club for $109 and they were really nice. I thought I had researched this product thoroughly, but there was no mention of the ""sound leakage."" It was a deal breaker. If the leakage isn't an issue, they're a great product. If it is, look further before you purchase."
3,Clipping Earphones,"I've owned several pairs of Sennheiser earphones over the years; this is the first pair that exibit speaker clipping. I listen to a variety of music genres (rock, blues, country, folk, bluesgrass, soul). If I turn up the volume on anything with a moderate to strong bass track, these earphones start clipping. Perhaps I'm not thinking about this the right way, it may be that the quality and range of the speakers won't permit them to be driven so hard; I'm not sure."
5,Ear Orgasm,-I would highly recommend the HD595's!I am currently listening to them now with Rob Dougan on repeat (ear orgasm).-I would recommend [..]Bass Boost cMoy v2.02 Headphone AmplifierThese two marvels of engineering have made me have a whole new respect for music.
3,Could Be Better,"I aslo have this as a computer game. Timon & Pumbaa has now thier very own Jungle Acrade. The games are Burper, Jungle Pinball, Sling Shot, Hippo Hop, and Bug Drop. If you start a new game of Sling Shot, and still is playing after level 3, Timon comes into the game and tells a joke that I find is old[.] .... Get this game if you have a Timon and Pumbaa fan in the house. Each game on here has it own sets of rules some are long and some are short. Maybe instead of having Timon coming on the screne and saying ""try to waste the beeries thier berry important."" He could have said, ""Remember don't hit me or any of my friends."" Or ""The more levels you play the shorter the time you get."" Or maybe not come on at all after the 3rd level. I am normaly bad at Jungle Pinball. But my father is better at it then me. Timon & Pumbba should have aslo said something diffretn like on Bug Drop like ""Hey Timon this is one heck of a good player,"" or ""Hey Pumbaa please don't eat the pieces of this game."""
3,Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games,I have this game for the computer. I havn't played this game on the Super Nintendo yet though. It is pretty fun! The best mini Game I think is HIPPO HOP.
4,on Donald evans and his stamp world,"To be able to be so interested in such a singular imagery, that is to create a world within a world, is that which writer's do well.And for the visual, image making artist to do so certainly does not surprise me either.But, to come upon the adult artist still engaged in his childhood fantasy is totally deliightful.To have the opportunity to see the many, many sets of postal stamp creations, the scenes, and the countries imagined in such a simple straight forward way, is to know that today's culture can still produce the artist whom does not need to impress by 'socking you in the face' for dramatic effect.Whether you are an artist and or an art lover, I suggest that you spend a day or so with this delightful book. I think that you will come away better understanding the child in the adult artist better.Too bad, too sad, for he & we, that he did not get to live out a long life ......... as who knows what his maturity might have produced?EMW, artist, 4-5-10."
5,Wonderfully written!!!! Excellent read!!,"""Seasons"", as my girlfriend and I call it, was a wonderfully written novel. As I read through some of the other reviews, I noticed a common thread, Ms. Busia's writing ""takes you there"". Yes, you can smell and taste the foods; you can see and feel the ocean water; you can feel the breeze. You can feel the dirt under your feet; you can see the trees swaying back and forth; you can picture with clarity, the different settings that she describes. I could not put this book down and I tried to prolong getting to the end. It held my interest without a doubt. I have recommended it to those folks that I know who participate in book clubs. I've recommended it to all my friends. Althought I read this book some time ago, I can still remember the story and all of it's glory. I think it's time for me to read it again......I anxiously await another novel from Ms. Busia."
5,One of the most beautifully written books I have read,"This story flows with such beauty and grace you won't want it out of your site until you've finished it. I felt transcended with Beento as he traveled to the exotic lands mentioned as well as being brought back to reality when in New York. I disagreed with his lifestyle choices, but admired is devotion. I am not sure if I disliked the ending or I just disliked the fact that the book had to end.I hope Ms. Busia will honor us with another book in the very near future."
5,A wonderous tale of life and love.,"'Seasons' is easily the best novel I've read. I was captivated by each character from Ashia to Solomon. As someone mentioned earlier, this story should be made a movie. Share this one with a friend. Here I was thinking I was the only person who felt this way. I can't wait until Busia's next novel arrives."
2,IT IS POORLY WRITTEN,THE SEASONS OF THE BEENTO BLACKBIRD IS A FEMINIST'S WORST NIGHTMARE. THE BOOK IS BASICALLY ABOUT A POLYGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A RENOWNED CHILDREN'S AUTHOR AND TWO WOMEN ON TWO SEPARATE CONTINENTS. I FELT ANGRY AT MANY OF THE WOMEN CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF THEIR STUPIDITY. WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE PROTAGONIST SOLOMON WILBERFORCE FOR ALL OF THESE WOMEN TO WASTE ALL OF THEIR TIME WAITING FOR HIM. THE CHARACTERS WERE ONE-DIMENSIONAL AND LACKED PERSONABILITY. MS. BUSIA NEEDED TO DO SOME SERIOUS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BEFORE PUBLISHING THIS WORK
4,Ring Float Dog Toy,"I got this toy for my border collie who has a thing for tearing the material from a Frisbee. He doesn't play with it as much as I'd hoped, I think because it is on the heavy side. Otherwise, he does want me to throw for a while, it's durable."
1,Did not care for it!,"In my opinion,this movie was not funny at all.I have seen better teen comedies from studio and indie titles.The movie overall really didn't have anything to do with the brief synopsis in it's review.I guess I am showing my age because between other great teen movies like Hollywood Knights,Porky's,American Pie,and Not another teen movie,this film is really crappy!Rent it if you must,but do not buy it."
5,Gettin' It,"I just bought this title and it his hilarious! Talk about delivering on every punchline. You will laugh yourself silly. Although little known, the cast is exceptional. I highly recommend adding this to your inventory of teenage comedy's. It is a classic."
4,"Not the best, but great anyway","It's not his best album, in my opinion, but I loved it anyway. I think it's worth it just for ""Words Of Love"". As always, Hyde's amazing vocals will instantly wash you away and capture you into a world of his creating.If you're new to Hyde or J-rock, I suggest Roentgen (English Version) or Faith before you move on to this album."
2,Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones,"Technically, item is as described. Like the concept but do not like choice of materials. I realize lightweight is a design goal but the lack of reinforcement in the plastic headband is a dealbreaker for someone with a larger head. After 2nd or 3rd use the headband is sprung and falls off. Would not buy again."
5,Very good audio; simple set-up; great price,Best headphones we've had. Stereo sound is amazing (took some getting used toafter several years use of our old 'phones). Excellent price and early delivery.
2,These headphones are no good!,"Whoever is thinking about buying these, be warned! These headphones are no good. Do not spend your money on them. I had them for less than 1 day, and already thay had that real bad fuzzy sound, and I was less than a foot away from the antana thing. Also, these headphones interfere with the telephone line, so in other words if you are listening to some music and somebody is on the phone, then they can hear what you are hearing. The onliest thing I found good about these things were that the earpieces were really soft. I hope my review helps somebody out in deciding whether or not to buy them or not."
1,Watch out for safety with this product,"Bought this product in February 28, 2011 and as of today it is already unfunctional due to a major ( at least to me) safety issue. Was wearing the headset yesterday and working fine, then all of a sudden smelt a bad odor kind like something in the room was shorting out and came to find that inside the earpiece where the batteries are it smoked the unit. Opened it up and battery housing area was blackened and confirmed the unit toasted itself. No heat or injury to me but now I have a dead product and both Amazon and 17th St Photo won't replace the unit. Claim no one-year guarentee even on product defect like this. Usually like Amazon's sub contracted vendors but will now be very cautious, and avoid Amazon whenever necessary as I like good service over good prices. What a way to end a long and mostly good business relationship. Happy New Year."
2,Durability,"Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging CradleI recently purchased this item to shield my wife from my computer noise. The first few days they worked fine except the would occasionally pop, which was disconcerting. After the first week they began to pop and hiss and I could not tune out the interference. Another day passed and all I could get was the hissing noise, no audio. Either I got a bad set of them or there is a circuit defect. I bought them based on the reviews of customers who had bought them from the Amazon site. I hope the reviewers are careful in their reviews, people really do read them carefully and spend their hard to come by money based on what they read."
1,completely annoying,"Whatever good qualities this product has are absolutely erased by the fact that these headphones will turn themselves off automatically when the music is too low, which means that any song that even attempts something interesting will trigger the effect.Here is how the experience goes down, which is almost like getting an electric shock that you know is coming:- you're playing your music and it has some subtle, low parts (soundtracks, classical, ambient, etc.)- there is a brief moment when the sound in the headphones cuts out, which isn't too bad.- there follows a transition to harsh static at the top volume of the headphone, which is like an ice pick to your brain.This design, which apparently was created to save power, is completely idiotic since they didn't need to play anything at all if power savings was the objective. The end result is a horrible experience where you just wait for the shock throughout the music. Do not buy these."
3,Noisy and Bulky,I found these headphones to be acceptable but they had a lot of white noise and are a bit larger then I was expecting. They work fine and the volume and tuning controls on the ear piece are nice. The charging cradle works well although you need to retract the ear cups back into the head piece to get it to balance on the recharging bars. If they were a little more quite I'd give them a 4 and if a bit less bulky they'ed get a 5.
4,"Great Sound, Bad Fit","Pros:These wireless headphones work exceptionally all around the entire house. I have walked from the third floor to the basement with no loss of reception.Cons: The Bass response does need more presence as others have stated, and the fit is very loose with no means to adust them. If you are just going to sit they will work perfectly, but if you are using them while excercising; they do have a tendency to fall off. Hopefully they will fix this design flaw. I would definitely buy again"
3,Good quality but too loose headphone,The headphone slides away and is to loose. There are no adjustments.Otherwise the sound quality is good and no functional issues.
2,Highly disappointed,"This unit came highly rated so I bought it unseen. After hooking it up, the reception is horrible. The volume and tune control are right next to each other so you constantly hit the wrong dial and have to re-tune it. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!There is no reason this does not have digital tuning."
4,Excellent product,"After having written several reviews panning some Amazon-promoted products, I'm pleased to give a positive response to this one.After some research with many pros and cons noted, I decided to buy this wireless headset as a way to keep peace in the family over TV volume.They work very well!I've had them for several weeks and can find no fault as some have listed.I had them on while watching a football game and had to go downstairs for a minute and the sound was the same at 50 ft. distance.Good stuff!"
3,Good sound. Design? Not so much.,"These headphones produce very good sound at good range from the cradle. There is a background hiss at all times, but it's only audible at very low volumes. Also, these look like around-the-ear headphones, but there's no ear cup at all. The ear pads sit flat on the ear, like smaller compact headphones, but because these are heavier, they tend to slide around if you tilt your head up or down. At first this is only a small nuisance. After a while however, you begin adapting your movements to compensate for it -- just like you might compensate for the wire on standard headphones. When you realize you're doing that, you have to wonder why you bought wireless in the first place. Finally, these headphones have a flimsy on/off switch on the left ear pad. Mine broke after four months, so I'm out. I'm sold on wireless headphones, but not these. My best advice is keep looking."
3,quality,This headset is not nearly as comfortable as the Orginal and is almost impossible to wear for any lenght of time.
4,Great Bargain,"Despite the complaints I noticed in the reviews, this product works just fine. The reception is crystal clear and with good range. I do not hear any ""ringing"" or other interference, so I would assume that users who noticed this have other electronic products in use that are responsible for the noise. The headphones are perfect for doing chores around the house during football season! I get to listen to the game with great sound and when there's a play I want to see, I can just run to the TV and best of all, no disturbing the rest of the family by blasting the TV throughout the house."
4,"Sound is great, could be a lot more comfortable though","I bought this so I could watch T.V. while my husband is studying, computer and T.V. are in same room and he needs quiet to study. I had the tv ears before that and they were terrible! This product is much higher quality as far as sound and works great for me to watch/listen to tv while he studies undisturbed. However, it isn't that comfortable to me. The headphones just don't adjust enough for me to get a comfortable fit so they slid around if I move my head to much, and I wish they were lighter. But, other than the comfort factor they are great and do exactly what they were advertised to do. I also like how easy they fit on the charger and are always ready to go as long as you put them back to charge when done. Very easy set up too although the directions are a bit slim, but it's pretty easy to figure out what to do and get them set up."
4,Serves my purposes fully -- excellent sound quality,"I bought these after reading these reviews. My purpose is to augment my reduced hearing acuity. The speakers of my 60"" Samsung are in the back and the sound is fine for my wife but ""muffled"" for me. This headset does the trick. The volume is set on the TV comfortable for my wife and on my headset comfortable for me. This has been particularly helpful watching soccer games from the UK and Spain where the commentators' accents are sometimes difficult to understand. As a minor negative, I too, believe they should have separated the tuning device from the volume contol by a little more distance to avoid moving the wrong one. The headset is comfortable and the set-up was straight forward. I did not need to adjust anything on the TV set itself."
5,Wonderful wireless headphones,I purchased these headphones for my late night tv watching husband. I was very tired of the volume changes waking me up. This was the best thing I have purchased. He & I love them. He can listen to TV all night and it doesn't bother me at all. It is very comfortable & has wonderful sound. This would also be great for those who have to have the tv louder then the others would like. I like that you can also watch TV at a volume that you are comfortable with or it can be put on mute. We have this set up in our bedroom upstairs and are able to go downstairs and still get reception.
5,Ahhhh...freedom,"I love this headset! I have no problems whatsoever with it and use it constantly. I love how I can just put it on its stand and it will charge. Plus there isn't any special way to put it on, you just set it on its stand.I love the freedom that it gives me with my Creative Zen MP3 player (It includes the attachment to plug it in). I hated the armband and was always snagging headphone wires. These Headphones are big improvement."
4,For Hearing Loss/ Depending on Purpose,"For what you get, it's an excllent vaue. I purchased the 120 for my partner who has significant hearing loss, so that I wasn't subjected to inordinately loud volume when he watches TV and I am in another room trying to listen to music. Achievement of my aim to have liitle or no sound coming from the TV was only partly realized since the TV out rca jacks must have a reasonable volume for the transmitter to work. Too low TV volume and the headphones need too much gain which introduces extraneous noise. With the TV at a normal listening level, that all disappears and the sound is quite acceptable, and he is quite pleased with the result. So if your aim is to reduce excessive volume in the room, they work quite effectively, However the headphones do not work with the TV on mute, so for my purpose a different setup may have been better. If your partner has hearing loss and you watch TV together, it's an excellent solution."
5,Excellent headphones! exceeded my expectations,"I just got these headphones, and this is my initial impression[+] Headphones are very comfortable[+] The bass is very good and volumes get very high with clear sound.[+] Very easy to use, i just plugged the charger&transmitter; in and voila.[+] Some very nice gimmicks like: to charge the headphones you place them on the charger without connecting anything,it's cool and elegant.Overall these headphones exceeded my expectations which were already high.Good work Sennheiser."
1,"Lousy item, great Amazon service","Updated, 12/20 - Upon further review, this is a pretty bad product. I am now experiencing the same ""shut off"" that many others were."
1,Big Disappointment,"These do not work with plasma TVs, it says so right in the booklet. It went right back to Amazon."
2,Headset too heavy and bulky,Did not set up and test this product. The headphones were too heavy and bulky for my elderly mother to handle.
2,"Great sound, awful usability.","The headphones sound great, as one might expect from Sennheiser; unfortunately, they are very uncomfortable to wear, and do not stay on the head very well. They are also somewhat heavy, so if you tilt them back to get the weight of the band off of the crown of your head, they fall off immediately. There is no horizontal sizing mechanism, so unless your head is somewhat wide, you will not enjoy them."
3,Buzzing sound is anoying,"Charges nice, range is good, headset fits nicely, price is ok, but no matter where I put it the charging cradle or how I tried to adjust headset, I occasionally, have this background buzzing.I wanted to give it 2.5 stars, I rounded up because maybe it's just my apartment.Good luck"
1,Awful Sound Quality,"Lots of static sound with these.....I have tried playing around with the settings for hours, but not matter what channel I use I get static, and if I move my head slightly it changes. Even worse, sometime when I'm listening it will suddenly stop sending music, and instead sends load static noise at full blast which can damage my ears!On the plus side they are fairly comfortable, look good, and have good battery life, but what is the point if they can't even produce sound properly.I live in an apartment building so perhaps there is interference with other people?Anyway I would stay away and spend a little more money on a pair that actual works (I'd recommend digital rather than analogue)"
4,Excellent Quality,Got this for my grandfather and he is hooked to this device. Watches TV for about 8 hrs a day and he is 91!! Need I say more?
5,"My neighbors don't hate me anymore, well maybe they still do.","After receiving a letter calling me a stupid person, irresponsible, and other profanities from my neighbor. I decided to purchase these headphones for barbequeing in. They have a great range and are built tough. I've dropped them several times on hard tile from about 6'. My elderly neighbors still don't wave at me or talk to me but they don't send me hate mail anymore. Some people just don't appreciate Pantera. These headphones will last about 16hrs on a single charge. They sound great and audio clarity is superb."
4,Loved it but need more trouble shootomg Info.,THis is a very good unit ir fits nice and being hard of hearing it bring the sound so realestic that I forget I have them on. the only objection I have is that if the soumd on the TV is not up far enougfh than you will have it on and all of a suddeb you get loud static. I had to callwhich was not toll free and talk to a tech and thats when I found out about the TV sound was to low. that shoud have been in the manual
1,Sennheiser RS120 926 HZ Head phones,"After charging batteries 24 hours AND PUTTING INTO SERVICE, I could not get the thing to function. The red lite worked for charging , the green light would not function to indicate a audio tranmission. I tried rebooting it by unplugging power supply, and removing batteries, but to no avail. Batteries tested OK, all I received was static and a hissing sound.Don M. Galt Ca"
1,Piece of junk,This item has never worked. All I get is static. I would not recommend this piece of junk electronics to anybody. Do not buy a Sennheiser headphone. I wasted a good chunk of money.
1,"The Sound of Silence - static, actually. Product returned.","Didn't work. Battery charged, directions followed, and connections to a variety of sources all good - result: static. Nothing but static. Dunno. Called manufacturer tech-support guy; he couldn't figure it out either, so approved a refund, which was promptly made upon item's return. No complaints about the vendor, but I am loath to try another of this headphone. If I could use negative stars, this'd rate a minus five."
4,Sennheiser wireles headphones,"No question, wireless headphones are a great and useful idea.Check-out the return policy of the shipper. I bought mine asa gift, my wife wasn't fond of them but the 10 day period forreturn had lapsed. Now I have to E-Bay them, service is notwhat I would have expected on an unused product."
4,Quite satisfied,"Have had for six monthes - great purchase price, sound quality is very good - while watching TV I can hear other background sounds in the program viewing not normally noticed without the headphones. Does not block out outside sound totally which can be good or bad. Range is about half of what the rated distance states, but more than enough for my use. Phones tend to slid off of my head if I tip my head down at times. Other than these minor items I am very pleased with Sennheiser RS120 head phone set."
5,Fantastic head set,"Work doing digital transcription from home, this headset is used 7 days a week. This is the best I have ever used, and I've tried many. Very comfortable, and seem to fit well.Also downloaded an audio book, and was able to listen from everywhere in my home. Highly recommed this to anyone."
1,Interferance,"I bought these headphones specifically to watch television with since I am much too far away from the television to be able to hear it without disturbing others. Sitting directly beside me as I watch television is always my laptop which I use for various things included running a business. I am connected to the internet at all times and I like to multi-task and watch television while I am using the internet. For some reason my internet kept running extremely slow all the time and for the life of me, I just thought it was the darn cable company. Finally i came to find out that my internet was working fine when I wasn't watching television, but as soon as I turned on these headphones, away it went. These things are useless if it going to ruin my wireless internet connection. Hopefully I will find a less intrusive pair soon."
4,Head Phone Setup,"Unfortunately, the directions for setup are not explicit enough. You are not informed that the headphones do not work plugging into the output jacks with a VCR attached to the TV. Also, you cannot get audio reception on the VCR without a special hookup. Once connection is made, the headphones are clear and I am able to get reception throughout my house. Overall it serves my purposes."
3,Good wireless set for the money,"Considering the price: great sound, comfortable, awesome charging cradle. I'm satisfied spending $80 on this set. 1 huge drawback for me as you'll see in other posts here I'm sure... awful LOUD static noise when signal is dropped. A few times already, working on computer listening to music, not noticing the 'silence' between songs (Pandora)... and WHAM!!! sharp static pierces my ears! Not physically harmful because I don't have volume very loud... but it's startling. Terrible design (are all wireless headphones like this?)"
2,HDR 120,"I like these headphones a lot, but they have a major bug. Range is great, they are very comfortable, sound quality is awesome, and you can fine tune the signal and volume on the headphones. If the signal strength gets too low, the headphones disconnect from the transmitter and broadcasts a ear-popping array of screetches, pops, and buzzes. This has nothing to do with distance from the transmitter, but rather the volume of the original source. I find that I have to turn up my TV or computer to a louder than normal level and turn down the volume on the headphones to avoid these nasty noises.For the price of the product, this issue is really not acceptable. I'm disappointed with Sennheiser for releasing a product with such a major flaw."
5,Hearing clearly,"Having a severe hearing problem, being unable to hear the spoken word, either withpeople or TV or radio or any listening device. Needed ear phones that did not goinside ear canal. My audiologist recommend the Sennheiser R120 over the EarWireless. I proceeded to do my own research and decided this was what I waslooking for so I ordered same......I have been extremely pleased with ease ofoperation and clarity of sound.I priced in-store and after getting price, decided to look on Amazon.com andfound price to be cheaper and also received free shipping.Purchased a Striderbike for grandson also on Amazon at a fabulous price andfree shipping and additional promo discount."
3,"Not bad, but a little too much static.","I liked this product as a whole, but the static was a little annoying, I was hoping for a little something better for this price. But I'd still probably buy it again."
2,loud hum all the time,"This product has some perks, It's nice looking, the headphones fit nicely, the charging station is neat. However the draw back is that no matter what I did there was always a humming sound when being used. I read a lot of the other reviews that said it wasn't very loud or distracting but I found it extremely annoying and not something I would put up with to continue to use the product."
5,Just what we were looking for,"After much research and reading countless reviews, I settled on this pair of headphones for my wife to use at night so not to disturb our newborn who is in the bedroom with us. They are prefect, so perfect I'm buying another pair for the living room so I can watch movies and crank the sound which I'm not able to do in our apartment. Setup took seconds and they are more comfortable then my corded Sony studio headphones I use for work."
2,Doesn't work with digital audio,"I really, really wanted this to work. I even bought two headsets, thinking that these would be the solution to our t.v. problems. Unfortunately, the headphones have analog sound jacks and are incompatible with my new t.v.s that have only digital audio outputs (they have analog inputs, though). I went to an electronics store to find out if a digital audio output adapter exists, but the guy looked at me like I was nuts. I had to return both headsets and am still searching for a solution (maybe bluetooth)."
4,sennheiser rs120 has one flaw in my opinion,"The RS120 is my second set of wireless Sennheiser headphones which I use to watch TV. Both have the same sometimes very irritating design flaw. When I am wearing them, if I bend my body over, e.g., to pick up something from the floor, they slide off my head. It has nothing to do with audio performance but it is a vexing problem, expecially when I have something in both hands. I think there is a simple solution they could implement.Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with these headphones."
1,Bad product. Dont be fooled by the 5 star rating.,"I bought this a week ago, I was surprised by the sheer number of 5 star reviews, and didnt bother reading the 1 star reviews. After setting up the product, I just couldnt get rid of the static, even after going through the numerous tips and tricks given by various members on Amazon. The static just wouldnt stop, and the frequent crackles and pops was just too frustrating. If you're an audiophile and would like the minimum of what could be defined as a clear sound, dont buy this. What a waste, I'm sending it back today."
3,alittle awkward,"I thought these would be graet for late night tv listening but after about 35 min. I found them uncomfortable and could not find a way to make them more comfortable so I sent them back. Once or twice I did experience the popping sound others talked about. Maybe if I were younger I'd put up with the discomfort 70 yrs), the sound quality was good."
2,Interference at random angles,"This product works alright... my biggest gripe (and it is becoming a BIG one) is that it gets interference at random angles, no matter what I do...Cons: Fuzzy squealing sound that I can't make stop! I sit at a desk while I use these headphones, and looking very slightly (even an inch( in any direction often sends a fuzzy ""squeal"" out. Sometimes, I feel like I haven't moved at all and the interference creeps in and squeals. It is very annoying. Also, the headphones themselves are quite large.Pros: Range is good. Charging cradle is very convenient. Buttons are workable. Price is low.Bottom line: The fuzzy interference that comes with any sort of movement is a deal-breaker. Yeah, it's cheap, but still not worth it. I would tell a friend to steer clear of this product and invest in something with a better, more consistent sound."
1,Wait a minute!,"I bought two of these and returned two.Pros: Their pretty, easy to hook up and everything is included.Cons: very unconfortable fit.you have to TUNE the set MANUALLY with a buttonright next to the volume control.Constant Loud Hiss regardless of where tuned.Acoustics poor."
2,Disappointing,I really wanted to like this product but it just does not perform up to expectations. Despite increasing the gain on the receiver there was a hiss you could never escape. The sound quality was OK but hardly analytical and detailed as described. The high and very lows were good for headphones but the midrange is muddy. Pop rock sounds great but more demanding music ties it up in knots.The one fatal flaw though is the volume auto adjust if you dont have music playing all the time you can get a sudden painful blast of noise. This is the main reason I rarely use it.I did let the headphones 'burn in' for 40 hrs before coming to a conclusion it does help but but it is hard get over the problems with the wireless equipment.
2,so so,"Quality of sounds is good. 2 things I don't like are that there is an analog tuner to tune in the sound. What is the point of that? There is a stereo input coming directly from the TV. What is there to tune? In my opinion it only allows you to take what should be quality at 100% if left alone, and allow you to reduce the quality. Pointless. The second thing is that they headphones are not molded around your ear so if you move you head slightly they fall offf real easily. I have to lie really still in bed to make sure that they don't fall off my ears. Otherwise they are as advertised."
5,Great for Hard of Heaing Individuals,"Thw wife and I are both hard of hearing and we each wear hearing aids but the Headphones have done such great job of making our hearing and understanding of each word as it comes through our TV Set very sharp with excellant clarity. The Sennheiser R120 for the price is remarkable As a result we now own two Sennheiser. Thank you.- As a famous actor would say, ""You May my (our) Day"""
3,Falls off me head,"I have and like the RS130's and wanted to get a second pair for my wife as a way to get around my (and most? all?) receiver's design of insisting on turning off the speakers when I use the headphones (oh yeah, WHO would ever dream of wanting to leave the speakers on when they use headphones).Apparently Sennheiser in their wisdom was stopped producing the 130's, and the cost, even for used ones, has gone through the roof. So I decided to get the 120's as I don't really care about the 130's ""surround sound"" mumbo jumbo. Although the audio of the 120's is fine, little did I realize how different the feel of wearing them is. Whereas the 130's are cupped and fit nicely around the ears, ""grabbing"" them so I can walk around and do stuff and forget that they are on, the 120's are flat and kinda push against the ears. Don't lean over the sink with these on!"
2,Tried 2 of these so far,"I have purchased 2 of these & returned both to Amazon. They both have a problem with static on the headphones side of the equipment. It will be working fine then if you turn your head wrong, some loud static right to your ears. Very hard to adjust the volume when the static begins. I honestly couldn't recommend this item."
5,Great wireless headphones,"We just finished our basement and have some workout equipment by the TV by the furnace. Whenever the furnace kicked on, I would have to crank up the TV volume so high, it interfered with my husband's music in the basement bedroom. Even though I still have to turn up the volume on the headphones when the furnace comes on, it does not affect the volume on the TV so my husband can record music or listen to music without TV interference. This was a good purchase for us."
4,Good quality and great price...without wires.,"I liked:This model is very comfortable and lightweight. Great sound quality (it sounded as nice as corded headphones) and it has a volume control built into the unit. The transmitter has a nice range and also charges the headphone battery.Unit automatically shut off after a few minutes if no audio is going through them, but it also has an On/Off switch, some might prefer to turn it off manually.Low priced compared to other less featured headphones.Didn't Like:Sometimes there was noise and hiss mixed with the sound, what could have been interference. In this case switch to another channel.The tune and volume controls are too close to each other.The bass wasn't as powerful as I would have liked.In the included manual, they listed a 3.5mm / "" adapter, which I could not find."
5,Sennheiser rs 120 wireless headphones,"I am very pleased with this product. The sound is good, the set up easy and the price is right. The volumedial could be larger and placed at a better spot but that's minor. Delivery was in 5 days. The range is good.I have gone about 50 ft. from the transmitter and still had perfect sound. Good buy."
4,Not bad for the money,"Once we got the product working we were pretty happy with it. The instructions for the product are on the weak side and it took us a while to figure them out, but once we got them working they sound really nice. The kids like being able to fire up iTunes and walk around the house with the headphones on."
3,Fair H-phones,"These are ok headphones. Great sound. I did have a pair of RS 110 but the headset went bad. They want to fall off your head if you bend your head over just a little, not the best if you are walking around.I hope these last longer than the RS 110 set."
4,Works great so far!,So far I'm really impressed with these headphones. I used them to listen to the digital radio while I worked around the house today and I got great reception in most every room. The one I did have a problem in was just slightly fuzzy and it was the furthest room in the house and we have a pretty large house. I do wish they weren't quite so bulky but it seems to that way with all of them from what I can tell.
4,Headphones,"Bought this item for my wife. Good sound, no interference or hissing.Easy to hook up and I was able to place it right on top of the TV.My wife is not to keen on the way they fit on her ears. They don't fit around her ears but, on hers ears. She had tried a pair on at Radio Shackand liked the fit better.Overall a quality product and a great price."
3,Adequate,"Not as sturdy as I expected, but I suppose they should hold up to regular wear and tear. Sound quality is adequate; the range of bass and treble are ok, but a background hiss is audible even when at a short distance from the transmitter. Overall, the fact that these are wireless and allow me to watch TV at night without waking up the whole household is invaluable. However, considering that any reasonable pair of corded headphones would easily provide better sound, the $70 price tag appears a bit excessive."
4,Works Great,"Good sound quality (Sennheiser products are 1000 times better than Bose). Signal transmits well through my cabinet, can adjust the frequency and the volume from the headphones themselves without getting up. Only problem with them is they are a little stiff so if you move around a lot, they can fall off. Otherwise fantastic."
1,"Uncomfortable, noise producing, interference gathering -- just don't.","Trust me, you can find better headphones on here. These headphones are just bad.* They are super uncomfortable to wear on the head -- and overheat your ears.* When the audio stops coming from the computer you are overwhelmed with a loud buzzing noise.* Requires bulky non-standard charging stand.Save yourself the trouble, buy a tiny Bluetooth adapter (10 dollars) and a pair of Bluetooth headphones (I recommend Kinivo, for $30)."
4,Pretty darn good,"I am not an audiophile. I bought these head phone because in order to hear the TV I have to turn it up so loud it drives everyone else out of the room. I have tried TV ears and several other headphones and found them lacking for one reason or another. I love these headpones. The sound quality is excellent, maybe not compared to a set of high end head phones, but certainly compared to that of the TV alone. They are comfortable to wear and I can go anywhere in the house and still hear clearly in stereo. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the loose fit, which makes them comfy if you sit still, but easy to fall off if you get up and move around. Now my wife wants a pair."
2,RS130 vs RS120,"We have a RS130 that we bought couple years back and love it, we bought this down grade version RS120 for other TV room thinking it should work the same for $ 30 less..we were wrong...The headphone was not as comfortable as the RS130, the size or curve can not be adjusted the way RS130 works, it kept falling off our head. The volume & tuner bottoms are ""wheel turning type"", you can easyly loose your frequency if you just scratch your ear or simply by turning your head, and to tune back to the right frequency is a big challege, the stalics is constant, the volume is not consistant, one side is so much louder than the other one (they are design like this, but this one is way off the scale), The charges works just like the RS130. Only thing I like is saving you $30 buck, but I can not get though the tuner button( RS130 is push button), so we return it the next day and got ourself another RS130."
2,"When it works, it works!(....but only when it works)","Well...you have to be careful with this purchase. You need to know how it will operate with your other hardware (e.g. TV, computer) . Unfortunately, these headphones cannot stay in tune no matter how close the headset is to the base. When it works, the sound is great. However, the interference from my TV ruins this purchase. What a shame..."
2,Quality sound/uncomfortable headphones,"I own the RS120 and a extra headset HDR120. I find both headphone sets to be very uncomfortable very quickly. I also own a Radio Shack wireless headphone set that is installed on another TV. The earphone cushions are big soft and fit over the ear, will stay on while you exercise, and they are comfortable for hours. The RS120/Hdr120 on the ear headphones begin to hurt almost immediately. The sound quality is great, but the ear cushions are ultra thin. Additionally, if you want product support by phone, be ready for a challenge."
2,Sent them back,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging CradleSince I have hearing problems I was excited about getting these hooked up to TV and be able to watch movies without CC. I was very dissapointed. They would work sporadically and hiss a lot. To me the flat ear pad was unconfortable. Perhaps I should have ordered the 140's.
2,Static is unbearable in wireless headphones,"The Sennheiser RS120 was my first wireless headphone and probably will be the last one as well. After having tripped, tangled, snapped and spilled stuff with my wired headphones so far, I thought a wireless headphone would be my savior. But the static in these things is just unbearable. It's not that there's a lot of it, but when you keep hearing that sharp crackle every minute or so, you tend to get a headache after a while. And nothing really helps it - tried different channels, different placements, different angles, just doesn't work. You might say the Sennheiser ones are the better ones compared to other wireless ones, but after my experience I think my cheap in ear headphones are a lot better than these."
4,They work for me,I'm pleased with the headphones they came with every thing it said (including the 1/4 & 1/8 adapters) works well. I live in an apartment and watch movies late when i get off work these headphones work great. No complaints for the price great sound & and looks good (they match my TV and stand) no cut offs when I go to the frig to get another beverage ;-) .
4,shortwave listening use of cordless headphones,"I have been using the cordless headphones for shortwave radio listening . Specificalyy, the Ham radio bands . It is very convenient not to have wires . I leave the radio room and go to the kitchen, make coffee, etc. and still stay in touch with the radio . Occasional hissing occurs but only for a second. Definitly adds a nice level of fun to the hobby."
4,Works well,I think this is a good product but I do not like having to tune in the headphone to the transmitter. The knob can be shifted putting on or off the phones and then will need to be readjusted.
3,Decent Wireless Headphones for the price,"I bought these because I live in a small house and didn't want to bother my girlfriend with the TV in the morning and when she is sleeping. It works well, but it occasionally disconnects when there is silence in the programing, and wines in your ear. There is also a hum in the background. It is tolerable for the reasonable price."
5,Hubby Happy!,I got these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them. They arrived within a few days are were packed well. I like them because they take up a small space on our TV cabinet. He now listen to his SyFy movies while I listen to my music. :).
2,Rechargable Battery Problem,"Charged unit and it only lasted for 20 minutes before the batteries went dead. We then replaced the batteries that came with the unit with different ones and charged the unit again. It worked fine, but we are disappointed that the company would ship units with such lousy and possibly defective batteries that did not seem to hold their charge. The headset is OK, but if you buy, there is a chance you will have to spring to fix the manufacturer's apparent battery problem."
5,Great headphones!,These headphones were just what my husband needed. He can now watch all his favorite shows and movies and understand what is said. He has had 2 sets of TV Ears but says these beat them by far. Clear and full sound.
3,Sennheiser head set,Headset has excellent clarity and gives me a good understanding of words. Fells very comfortable on my head and ears. Negative side- the TUNE switch is almost impossible to adjust. It goes from too low to to one ear only to a tiny spot where both ears can hear then to static and screeching. Terrible to adjust.May be defective. I have given up at times trying to adjust so both ears can hear and just listened with one ear and left the adjustment for another day when my patience was better. Otherwise it seems to be a great product.
2,Here is the truth,"I got these so I could watch TV in bed and not wake my girlfriend while she sleeps.Pros: Charge holds for a long time. Works well once you find the right frequency. Works all around my house.Cons: Unless you're using the 3.5mm adapter, this is a piece of garbage, best used as a paper weight. If ther eis no sound coming from the source (like if you're watching a movie and fall asleep and the movie ends) there is a loud (and I mean frightening loud) pop that is sure to wake you up in a panic when it returns to default power saver. Also a constant humming no matter how well you match the frequency"
1,Faulty Cradle,"When I first received this product, the charging cradle wasn't working; I had to request a replacement and the new item had the same issue; very disappointed!"
3,It's Alright...,"Straight to the point:-Sound quality is so-so. Not that good.-Limit on the maximum dynamic volume is far too low. In other words, it cuts off the frequency even when it's not too high. >>>> (Number one issue. Seriously, extremely annoying when listening to music, which I primarily use for, on my computer or iPod.) <<<<-Uncomfortable:1. Too heavy2. Too bulky (you can't sleep/lie your head to the side with it. Comes off easily + extremely uncomfortable if you do)3. Comes off your head easily if you bend down due to its weight-Connection dies for less than a second once in a while even when you're only about 30-50 ft. away.-Cheap looking materials for the base.I only listed the cons, but overall it's alright for a $80 wireless headphones. I guess you can't expect much with that price. I suggest buying a $100-150 wired headphones instead if you prefer quality. I'm gonna buy me another set of headphones with a much better quality.Again, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU PREFER QUALITY OVER PRICE."
5,These are the real deal!,Easy to set up. Very comfortable to wear. Crystal clear sound. What more do you need? I love these headphones!
4,good,I have had these for 2 years and they still work great. The one con is that you can't move your head much (especially down) or they will slide off your head.
4,Awesome for the price!,"I've wanted television headphones for ages now, because I'm sensitive to noise, both from indoors and outdoors. I probably drove my husband batty, telling him to turn down his TV. Now I don't have to, because he uses these headphones when he's watching TV or playing video games, and I use them when watching television and want to drown out the neighbor's dog barking and other noises.They were a breeze to set up and the sound is amazing. I've walked through my entire house with them and the sound never went out once. There is a slight hissing noise, but it doesn't take away from my listening experience at all."
2,rant of picky user,"Product is subpar in terms of sound engineering. Constantly spatters noises, tz - tz when switching TV from channel to channel or just turn head, and to top it all, I feel it's my fault because the model offers a spinning wheel to tune the headphones. Who the heck tunes headphones talking to own base. is it cb station? If you dare to miss with this little wheel just one tiny turn of the teeth off of what the magician sitting inside this device approved as correct position, lo and behold, the sound appears in the right headphone only. The sound is mostly of good quality, but nobody would blame you if you feel deaf on the left ear. Returning this item the day I got it. Giving it 2 stars because it still a useable product. One has to keep in mind, loud bangs produced by electric discharge in low quality audio devices is a health hazard. People working in environments with this kind of noises wear earplugs full time."
4,Much Better Than Expected,"Like many others, I bought these headphones to help with my declining ability to hear the TV at normal levels. I feared I'd be unable to balance the low volume my husband likes through the loudspeakers connected to the TV with what I need through the headphones. I connected them to the headphone jack on the front of my stereo receiver, switched them on and tuned to the TV. It works great. My husband keeps the remote to adjust as needed and I use the volume control on the headphones. Now, I can relax and watch the show rather than straining to understand the dialog. Since I'm connected to an FM receiver I've also been listening to radio shows from anywhere in the house without disturbing my husband. It's all more than I expected."
3,Sep 2012,Excelent audio quality with great wireless reach for a reasonable prize; unfortunately the headphones are not as comfortable as expected.
4,headphone,Good sound - easy tuningEar pads inadequate - my ears hurt after a while.color is a nice black.Stand for recharging is cool
4,Wireless Headphones,The headphones were delivered very quickly. The quality and function of the merchandise was as described in the summary. The sound is clear and distinct. I was very satisfied with purchase.
3,Order Fulfilled as advertised,I like the instrument but it is difficult to keep on my head. If I look down the headphones fall off. I am used to headphone cups that surround the ear and aid the stability of the headphones
4,Good with reservations,Basically I love it! good reception and I can watch tv late at night when I get home without disturbing anyone. The one issue I have is that the controls sometimes get knocked out of kilter by the pillow. So if you are sitting up its great but if you are lying down like sick in bed you may move and then have to readjust the settings.
1,Terrible Customer Service from Sennheiser,"I bought an RS-120, it does not work on my LCD TV. The manufacturer instructions indicate that ""some TV's can cause interference which can be eliminated by increasing the distance between the transmitter and the interference source""; this did not work on my RS-120.I called Amazon for advice on getting the product to work and they indicated that they could not help and to contact the manufacturer.I contacted the manufacturer, Sennheiser, by e-mail on Dec 18, 2006 and Dec 26, 2006 immediately receiving an auto-generated e-mail indicating that they would be ""review my inquiry and contact me"". I never heard from them.I contacted the manufacturer, Sennheiser, by phone on Janaury 3, 2007 and was put into a voice mail indicating they would contact me. I never heard from them."
1,Disappointment,"I own quite a few headphones by Sennheiser and in general I like them. Their price/performance ratio is hard to beat. RS-120, from the other hand, turned out to be a total disappointment. At first, there is high frequency hissing noise on all channels. At second, pads do not ""envelope"" ears, they are sitting flat against them and do not reduce environment noise at all (contrary to ad). At third, charging station, while looking cute, is a pain to use. It is not easy to set headphones on it in such a way that contact is established and charging light come up. I do not recommend these headphones to anybody."
2,Not What I Expected,"This is my first wireless headphone purchase so I can't say if the problems I experienced are inherent in all wireless headphones or are unique to these phones. Nor can I say for sure if there was interference specific to my home. I certainly am no audiophile but I have to say I was disappointed in my overall listening experience. There is a very distinct humming sound in the headphones. It is particularly noticeable during periods of silence. I found the playback quality of the music to be acceptable, but the crackle and humming very annoying. I tried to no avail, to tune the noise out by changing to each of the three available channels. Of course the music drowns out the background noise but the silent portions of a track or album are often a significant part of the overall listening experience."
3,Wireless Headphones don't stay put.,Great sounding with clear reception. The only negative is they do not want to stay on your head when you are moving around. If you walk around without moving your head you will be very happy with this headset.
4,Perfect for my Needs,"Allows me to move around the office without dangling ear-bud wires or having to carry my iPhone around with me. Not the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, but the positives outweigh the negatives.I've had these about 6 weeks with no problems."
3,It was a dark and stormy night...,"Product works well, but it is a bit bulky on my head and it weighs too much. I would prefer something with a smaller ""headprint""."
4,perfect!,"This is my 2nd wireless headphone. I love this fit ,I just wish it had more battery time when I charge it."
2,Disappointed,"I gave these to my husband for Christmas so he could watch TV when others in the family were doing homework or I was reading. Sadly, it turns out that they don't work with our television, so they are pretty much useless."
5,excellent product,Bought this for my husband so I didn't have to listen to hunting shows. Works great. He can wear headphones when a show he likes is on but I don't want to listen to it. Easy to wear and easy to charge.
2,Very disappointed,"After purchasing and spending a few days with these headphones, I'm wondering how on earth they can be given positive reviews...Pros:-Very well built-Batteries last a long time-Nice packaging-You can add as many headphones as you want for other listenersCons:-Very muddy bass with heavy distortion. I tried several different sources and I tried all three channels and the problem didn't go away.-Quality control issues. I had bought an add-on set of headphones at the same time and the quality of the bass was slightly better in those but still completely unacceptable.-Analog wireless signal with an always present and annoying hiss.-They shut off after a small amount of either silence or near silence, making them unusable for computer audio.I very seldom send something back, but these headphones are very disappointing and are back in their boxes. I'm so afraid of wireless now that I'll just buy a long extension cord for my existing headphones."
3,Sennheiser Headphones,"These headphones are a great concept that has yet to come to maturity. Often the static or interference over the wireless connection is bothersome.The flat design of the ear muffs, no cup to allow your ear to fit into, make them uncomfortable for long wear periods."
1,Horrible Sound,"Annoying hiss. No bottom to the sound, like an AM radio. I am very disappointed. My $20 Koss headphones sound so much better. This Xmas gift is going back to the store."
2,Disappointing,"The sound is OK except for a persistent hiss in the background.I've tried all 3 frequencies multiple times and it's always there.Especially bad when there is little to now sound coming through the phones.And if the music ends and you still have them on your head a minute or so later, loud screeching and hissing sounds assault your ears until you turn them off.I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Crackling,I've owned these for almost 4 years. They operate over radio frequency and there is ALWAYS a noticeable crackling noise in the background.
4,I would buy it again !,Works great first time out of the box. The only thing I would recomment to the Sennheiser is to make it a little snugger on the head. I would recommend this to anyone that has been using TV ears. TV ears tend to be a little bit uncomfortable after wearing for a couple of hours.
4,Love it,Great product. I got one for Christmas and ordered a second one for my wife. Great if you have kids.
5,Sennheisr RS 120,Fantastic! From the first hook up the sound was great. Good base. Excellent at all levels. Would recommend it to friends.
5,Doubled the size of my apartment,"My wife loves watching TV. I love when our apartment is quiet. This would not work without these headphones. No static, Good battery life. Shes uses it every day and we're happy in our own worlds but together."
3,"good, but not great","bought this one based on numerous reviews. I first hook it up with my receiver, no good at all, the sound is either very muffed or too much static noise; on the verge of returning it, I hook it up directly with TV, good enough for me to keep it.the bad? I actually expected a bit better build quality, but this headset feels cheap - the headset is getting so loose that it will fall off whenever I duck my head - in only one or two weeks, that is no good. but I am keeping it - since I figure 90% of the time, I will sit still."
4,I like these headphones,"My review of these headphones is a little mixed and different than the average user. You see; I bought these mainly to use playing my electric guitar through my multi-effects pedal.So first off, for playing guitar they are not perfect, if you use alot of distortion and heavy palm muting the volume seems to drop some; almost like smart sound trying to adjust itself, but its tolerable.Now for stereo music listening I think they are excellent, they have plenty of bass, very clear stereo sound and I can walk around the whole house doing stuff and even go out side and they work fine. They are also very comfortable for headphones and light weight."
3,Poor Audio Reception,"If you need wireless headphones that will work all over the house, then these are acceptable. However, these suffer the same drawback all other RF devices. The audio is never completely clear, there will be an undercurrent of background static.I would recommend these for scenarios where you can't have line of site to the receiver and audio quality isn't paramount."
1,Stopped working after 2 weeks,"I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my wife. It worked perfectly for a couple of weeks and then suddenly the transmitter started working only intermittently,often not at all. I would not buy this product again or recommend it. I definitely have buyers remorse about this purchase. Grrrrr."
2,"No Bass, No Volume","I have no idea how these phones get such a high user rating. They have absolutely no bass whatsoever, and the volume distortion breaking point is only about half way. So no volume either, unless you like the clicking and twitching sound of over burdened speakers. I tried a variety of music styles and formats, along with various types of players. I also used both the headphone jack and the RCA direct line-outs. The RCA lines sounded *slightly* cleaner, but not much. Also, they are NOT AT ALL Silent to the people around you.I must add that I did not have any interference, humming or static that other people were persistently complaining about. The volume and tuning knob locations don't bother me either. Build quality is as good as anything else coming out of China these days, not good, not bad. They are comfortable, and the charging system is well designed and effortless to use.All in all, the sound is the most important feature. Unfortunately they fail miserably."
2,Lots of background noise,The background noise level is very high (at least 4x more background noise than my wired headphones). The wireless link also picks up noise from fluorescent lights and fades as I move around my room. The headphones are comfortable and sound nice otherwise--it's a shame the wireless link is poor.
5,Money well spent,I purchased these mainly for my wife who is a night owl and tend to watch TV in bed while I'm trying to sleep. She has been very pleased with them. When I've used them I've been very impressed with the comfort and sound quality though I'm by no means an audiophile. The coolest thing is the charging stand - just plop the headphones on and they start charging. No alignment problems to worry about. Overall I am very pleased with these and would highly recommend them.
5,Life saver,"If you are having trouble hearing TV at a lower volume and have to crank up the volume to 70 just to hear the program, this set works great. Every one can enjoy TV at a sound level comfortable for all."
1,Purchased for my laptop and tv,"As stated in the title, so far this purchase sucks...headphones not working on my laptop!! Will now try on my tv!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought two new (not refurbished) RS 120 after doing extensive research online to find the best wireless headphones to replace the Sony's I had. Figured you also get what you pay for, well not here! If you like to listen to TV as if you were siting in the middle of a blizzard, this product is for you! forgot where the mute button is on the remote and are looking for alternative entertainment? You will love the challenge of trying to decipher the dialogues on your favorite TV show through Larsen effects and hiss, guaranteed hours of playful entertainment ahead...Enjoy!"
1,huh?,"these headphones are not designed correctly and do not stay on your head! they are extremely wide and loose, and do not even go over your ears! i have not listened to them but dont plan on it, i cant even move my head around with them on without them falling off! do not get these unless you have a gorilla head!"
3,Too much static,"I work in a crowded environment with lots of laptops and monitors, and it causes a lot of static. It's not too bad if the music is loud, but gets pretty annoying in between songs or during quieter moments. Not sure if it's just this product, or applies to all wireless headphones, but I'm definitely sticking with wires next time."
1,Its like listening to vinyl records but not as good,"Well, I got this product based on the reviews on this site, and I have to say, I am very disapointed with the quality of these headphones that carry the Sennheiser name. What cheap junk these headphone are! Super crappy sound quality, a hiss like a vinyl record you can't get rid of no matter what channel you put it on. The sound quality is a bit better than AM radio. Don't waist your money on these. If you are into high quality sound, these are not for you. I think sony makes better ones that are acceptable quality sound, but certainly much better than these. I have a new nickname for them as I will use them on my computer, Suckheiser."
5,Excellent Headphones,Headphones were as advertised and are excellent value for the money. The work well in house and in our motorhome. It took 12 hours for the batteries to charge and then it was easy listening. Highly recommended
5,Love 'em!,"I really like these headphones! At first, after having used some larger, heavier old Panasonic headphones for years, they felt a little strange on the top of my head, being able to feel the recharging contact points. After having adjusted to them, they now feel light and comfortable. The sound quality is great, living up to the Sennheiser brand name, which I have been familiar with for approx. 40 years. My TV is located on the second floor of a fairly big home, and there is very little drop off in sound quality when going down into my basement (a slight tuning adjustment on the headset corrects this).F.Y.I. I will definitely be buying a second unit for another TV set in the home."
1,Terrible. Just terrible.,"Unless I got a defective product, I just don't understand the good reviews for this. The reception is bad. I constantly had to adjust the sound and there was frequently some extra buzzing or something. Worst of all, sometimes it would just lose connection with the base and I'd have to go to the base and fiddle with it.I was not using this outside the bounds of normal use either. I wasn't moving around. I was less than 10 feet away. I just wanted to watch TV late at night in my bed. I had better wireless headphones 7 YEARS AGO! Too bad I can't find them."
1,A reliability disaster,I bought these headphones for my father-in-law for his Christmas present last year as he lives with us and his hearing is not good. The earphones stopped working in less than a week and Sennheiser simply did not respond to any entreaties I made for help. Sent them back. What a bummer...
2,cheap chinese goods,"Although I did not truly understand all the applications of these headphones...I immediately found the quality in the just the physical attributes very poor. They came in an envelope (not a box) as though it didn't matter whether they arrived intact or not, limited reception...overall, I felt they were just cheap Chinese goods wrapped around a great name in quality."
2,Uncomfortable Headphones,These headphones are very uncomfortable. The ear cuffs are very hard and hurt my ears after about fifteen minutes of usage. The headphones actually work well and have decent reception to about thirty feet away from the base. The tuning buttion is too easy to touch and move when you are trying to change the volume.
4,What?? I can't hear you.,"these headphones are great. i was looking for a wireless set to take some of the noise pollution out of our house and experience some of my music collection at a deeper level. Both happened. Physically, they are near perfect. They are easy to use and adjustable to all shapes of heads and the volume control is very simple. Overall, I am very pleased with these headphones and hope to have them for several years. I read reviews here and though I did my ""research"". Sometimes things aren't quite how the reviews say they are. But in this case, it's a home run."
4,Fine product!,"These wireless phones were purchased to replace some Sony's that were damaged by a lightning strike (NOT while on my head.) I have owned 3 sets of the Sony product, and wanted to try something else. The Sennheisers are very impressive by comparison. Since the basics of this product are fairly straightforward, there aren't many bells and whistles to rate. They fit well, hold a charge well and the sound quality is loud and clear. The Sony product may hold a slight edge in ear comfort, but it's a close call.So far, I really like these Sennheisers."
5,great product.,"I bought these for my husband for christmas. He loves them and the sound is excellant. You hear more of the background sounds than you do on the tv. Like a built in stereo. Also he can put the volume at any level and the tv can be low or even off for them to still work. Would recommend these for anyone, not just for those who have a hearing problem."
1,Done plan on moving around in these.,"I like wireless headphones because I can't sit still. I garden, clean; boring tasks that don't take a brain and I listen to CNN or talk shows. These things sit on top of my ears and fall off with the smallest movement. If you want wireless headphones for sitting on the couch or in bed these will do fine. They are comfortable but I wish I had sent them back the next day."
2,Headphones,I bought these headphones to watch TV. The sound is just OK they are loose fitting no matter how much I try to adjust them and get real hot after they on on for a while. Overall I would not buy them again.
2,Cheap Construction,"IMO, headphones costing close to a hundred dollars ought to last for more than a year. The price made me think it was higher quality than it was. That attitude made me a sucker, because my headphones died after several months. The wiring inside it has such a small diameter, it wears out in no time. My headphones short-circuited one day, ceased to charge up, quit picking up any sound, and finally went dead. An examination of the wiring showed me it was little better than filament wire. Can't they afford to beef up the wiring so the device will last awhile?"
2,pretty good... but stopped working,"This headset was pretty cool and worked pretty darn good... it was a little tricky to get it to sit just right and charge, but it sounded good and was comfortable. And then after a month or so of occasional use it stopped working, and so I shipped it back to Sennheiser. They acknowledged receipt of it, and now it's three weeks later and I haven't heard back from them.Three weeks to repair or replace a defective part is unacceptable, in my opinion.Update: I emailed Sennheiser to ask about the status and they replied that they HOPE to look at my product within the NEXT TWO WEEKS! So they'll have my defective product for at least a month!"
1,I got what I paid for,"The product did not work well. I experienced interference, loss of sound from one headphone and battery issues. You may get one that works, but I did not."
2,Not What I Expected,"I'm a 60 year old male, wife hears fine, I don't. She wants the volume low and I can't hear. I thought this headset would solve the problem. Wrong. Two problems.1. About every 15 min. the unit stops sending a signal. I have to disconnect and reconnect the cable to the audio out to regain the signal.2. The Major problem is that the headset volume is pegged to the TV volume. Turn up the TV and you higher volume on the headset. Turn down the TV volume the headset volume goes down. I can't adjust the volume up enough to really hear when the TV volume is set low. If my wife is not in the room I can unplug the audio in cables to the TV and turn up the volume to hear. But this only works if we are not watching the same program. So much for sharing the same program.Headset is comfortable and sound quality is good but volume control and transmitter are not up to snuff."
1,disappointed,"Counting on quality from the Sennheiser name, I was disappointed as the transmitter wouldn't power up. I sent the item back and purchased a pair of wireless headphones at the mall from Brookstone and they work fine."
3,Good While They Last,I have now ordered this product twice. They work very well while they last but they don't last very long. I ordered the first hesdphones in early December 2011; by the end of April they were dead. I like to wear them while I am working around the house or garden so I can hear music or a TV show. They has a good range and deliver a clear signal. However I found they have a tendency to fall off my head when I bend over to do something near the ground. After about the sixth such fall they were dead! I bought another one and I am going to rig a neck or chin strap to hold it.
2,Not good for my intended use,"I wanted a pair of wireless headphones I could use on the treadmill. Based on the reviews, I thought this might be a good fit. I tried to get these to work, but they just didn't. There was constant cracking and humming. I tried everything to limit it, but nothing helped. I moved the receiver, I spent a lot of time tuning, I spent time adjusting the source....nothing produced the sound quality others have mentioned. In addition to that, even with the volume at 100 on the source AV, the headphones did not produce a loud enough sound to completely block out the sound of the treadmill (or allow me to get into the workout). If you can figure out how to eliminate the hissing and cracking, these might be OK for use in bed. Other than that, I don't see a benefit. Thumbs down!"
1,Total Fail,"For me this thing was a complete flop. It's ill fitting and uncomfortable. It worked marginally well the first day except for a loud POP about every 4 minutes. The second day it lasted about 90 seconds then I could only get a loud static noise after the loud pop. The only way to get sound was to un-plug the jack and re-plug it, but then again after 90 seconds, etc etc etc."
1,Don't buy,Range is short and if you turn your head it gets out of tune and you hear a lot of static. When the battery discharges there is no warning- just very loud static- very loud! Hurt my ears. returned to Amazon after only a week of use. Amazon refunded promply.
4,"Awesome Sound, Easy Setup","Biggest problem I had is my bedroom tv is so far away from my bed. The wife was upset cause I would need to turn it up too loud and it was keeping her awake. Bought these after reading several reviews on this and other products. Do not pass these up just because they cost $10-$20 more than others that claim to do the same thing. You'll be happy you spent the extra money.Setup is very simple. I have a newer tv so there's a rca audio out. Plugged right into that, plugged them in and put the headset on. You'll need to tweak the bottom dial on the right ear to get the audio, but once it's tuned in you're set. I've only needed to dial it in 1 other time, but that's only because someone else messed with the dial.Avg watch time is around 1-2hr. I'll leave it off the charging stand for a couple days and they still have plenty of juice. Recharging is so simple...just put the headphones on the cradle. The cradle does mount to the wall."
2,Disappointing,"I bought these for my husband. Happy first father's day, I bought you a pair of crappy headphones. He's using them with his computer so as not to get distracted when working at home. Firstly, they're kind of bulky. The bar over the head is so oddly shaped, but he does have a small head. Then we plugged them in, it was easy to get going, but everyone in the room can hear what's going through the headphones. Sound quality was good but definitely not discreet or contained. The padding on the ears are flat rather than cupping around the ears, which relate to the lack of containing sound but also lends to being uncomfortable. We gave up pretty early in so can't comment to the charging, batteries, etc."
4,Hard to mantain in my head,"The sound of the equipment is excellent. Controls are not easy , too small. If I bow the headphone will not hold in place.Refer to the Sennheiser Wireless headphone RS 120 pURCHASED THRU AMAZON"
4,Great purchase,Has a range of about 600 feet as long as there is no building between you and the output.
1,REALLY poor fit,If they won't stay on your head there is no need to comment on the sound. I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the fit unless they have a square head. I have a fairly normal sized head and they are very loose fitting. They fall off when I move my head. Worst fit for head phones I have seen. I modified mine and they are somewhat improved but still objectionable. A waste of money.
5,Awsome Product,The Sennheiser RS-120 headphones far exceeded my expectations; I could not believe how crisp the sound was for this wireless set and you just cannot beat the price for this type of quality. These headphones have great (perfect to me ears) sound throughout my house/garage with absolutely no noise interference. Have previously purchased 'more expensive' Sony Wireless set and I was very disappointed with quality of headphones and the amount of noise interference. I also liked the design of the headphone base/recharger; sturdy yet small enough to be inconspicous.
2,very average,"I have used these headphones for about 5 months and pretty much hate them, here's why.* the stand allows you to select 3 different discrete frequencies, but the headphones make you tune it in to the right frequency with an analog knob, which is awkward, imprecise and is always getting knocked when I adjust volume. If there's 3 possible frequency settings on the base, there should be 3 on the headphones.* after a minute of no output from your computer the headphones will generate static VERY loudly into your ears. Apparently this is to save ""battery"" life, I'm not sure how generating very loud static saves any battery life, and since all you need to do on your PC to start them up again is press play, so clearly it hasn't turned off the receiver. If it went dead silent that would be fine, but generating static is annoying/pointless.I'm not an audiophile, I don't care about the sound quality so much, I just want an easy to use pair of wireless headphones, this is not it."
5,Sennheiser RS 120 Headphones,Headphones work great. Wife no longer has to interpret what is being said on the TV. I would certainly recommend it for anyone who has difficulty hearing the TV.
5,Almost perfect,"I've had these for almost 10 months now, and saw that I neglected to write a review. I'm glad I didn't. Up until recently, I had to have the base station in a certain place, and got pretty bad interference whenever I moved my head when listening to music. It got to the point where I'd more often than not reach for my HD203s (I'm not a Sennheiser nut, I just liked the 203s so much I splurged for these).Rearranging my workspace has allowed me to place the base away from whatever was causing the interference (most likely a speaker) and now these things rock me so hard. If you're looking for an immersive experience, like with noise-cancelling cups, you won't get it here. These are flat pads that really don't block out any exterior noise. However the range is really good, I can go outside and cut my grass and still get acceptable sound. They aren't the absolute most comfortable things, but then again I have sensitive external ears."
5,Great headphones for watching TV,"I've had these headphones for six days now, and I think they're great for watching TV. There were no surprises during installation. The rechargeable batteries already contained a charge, and I was able to test them right away. Once fully charged, these batteries can go on for days without recharging; depending on how many hours you use the headphones. These headphones drown out any surrounding noise, but I can still hear important sounds, such as the ringtone on my cell phone. However, no more annoying neighbor sounds! While tuning the headphones, I discovered I could receive HAM radio operators going on and on with their bro-mances. I give these headphones a five for the price. Don't get these if you require noise cancellation."
1,Almost useless,"I bought these because I have Sennheiser HD212 headphones which I found to be great.Unfortunately the quality of these wireless phones is great only if you are in a very close proximity to the base. Additional noises, clicks etc. start to appear only 10 feet away, 25 feet away the quality is really bad (no walls or anything else in between, maximum volume fed into the base for higher signal level). Also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head. I live in a area in a city with 4-5 story tall old appartment buildings around. Changing the channels does not help. While tuning the headphones you can also get to a phone conversations and other communications."
5,Perfect! Almost,My wife bought these headphones for me last Christmas (2004). I was thrilled and surprised. At first I did not think I would use them that much but I use them all the time. I use them at least 3 hours everyday. They have held up extremely well. The batteries are still holding a charge. Sometime the reception is not what it could be. You can certainly walk around the house freely but you will experience static in certain spots. Duh....it's wireless so you will have some sometimes. But 10 feet from the movie or ballgame is perfect always.
2,Disappointing,"The sound from these is very good, as long as it stays tuned in to the base which for me wasn't very long at a time. They have an analog tuner on the headphones that you tune into the frequency of the base. It was like an old car radio from the seventies and before, every time I'd turn my head I'd have to readjust them. I wasn't far from the base either, generally within 5 feet. There was a constant hiss in the background all the time also. I have a $20 cordless phone that hisses less than these did."
1,Does not work for people with small heads,"Even at the smallest setting, it slid off my head at the tiniest motion. As such, complete useless, and returned to Amazon."
5,Sennheiser Rs 120 over-ear 900mhz wireless RF headphones with charging station.,"I rate this very high because I use it because of my loss of hearing. My husband bought me the first set for the family room, I ordered another pair for the bedroom. They sound is very good"
4,Good!,"Reasonably priced, arrived on time and in one piece. Works as advertised. I have had no problems with this device."
4,Wireless Headphones,Seinheiser RS120 Over Ear 900MHZ Wireless head phones are well worth the money. The charging cradle is an excellent idea and a must when ordering. Wonderful clarity. Outside sounds are minimalized allowing you to concentrate on the program. A great aid for those who are hearing impaired.
4,Headphones,"We gave these to my dad who has bad hearing, he wears them so the rest of us don't have to suffer with the volume up high!"
3,"Okay, only for the young and nimble-fingered","Bought this RS120 Wireless Headphone to use with TV in replacement of older RS140 model no longer made. Works great as long as the fingers doing the volume adjustment on the headphone don't mix up the volume button with the tuning button just below it. When that happens, the channel is lost and is refound only with frustrating fumbling. Also, this model is much more susceptible to interference (and/or mis-tuning) than the RS140. It works great for what it's for--in our case, enabling one TV watcher to set personal volume without blasting the rest, and allowing that watcher to roam the house while listening to the TV. Highly recommended for the young and nimble-fingered, not so much for those who have trouble remembering not to touch the bottom button when adjusting the volume."
4,Good quality product.,"Sound and range is good. My only problem is the power adapter, which is a pain if I want to move the base unit, and the plug that connects into the base unit comes out easily, and is difficult to get back in. Otherwise I'm very happy with the purchase."
1,NON-WORKING PRODUCT,"Had obviously been used and returned then sent to me unrepaired ! I have no way to rate the product as it NEVER WORKED ! I ordered this as a new product and received a broken used one. I am very put out with the hassle! This was also a gift,so my grandson had nothing from me at Christmas!"
1,Two tries and never worked for us,"I bought this for my husband for the holidays. I was so excited. It turned on for about 5 minutes then went fuzzy/dead/snow. The 'on' light never came back on. We returned it for another. The next one came. The light stayed on, but when it would get tuned in the sound quality was so aweful, you could hardly hear the words for the low deep buzzing in your ears. AND you could not turn the volume on the TV down with out loosing all the sound in the headset. Sad - we are awaiting our complete refund.Amazon has been great through the first return, and we expect the same for the second, but the item iteslf is not worth the time in my opinion."
1,Do Not Buy,"We purchased this product for a hearing disabled lady and it has been nothing but trouble. It doesn't charge without fussing around, the batteries always go dead - very quickly - and now there is static that is just random and is uncomfortable. All of this happened after the 30 day return policy, so we are stuck with a very expensive product that will not work. They are very fragile and the least amount of movement shakes the batteries out of contact so it was fine if she wore them and didn't ever move. Now, they just will not charge and work without the nasty static. Not at all a reliable product."
2,Very fragile,"We were happy with our purchase but after a few weeks using, the headphones were dropped on the ground from 1' height. And since then it's dead, we open it to check what's wrong but we were not able to fix it. Now it's standing next to our tv and waiting to be thrown away. What a waste of money!"
1,More frustrating than useful,"Used on my PC to listen when the wife is sleeping. Temperamental and unreliable, if the audio signal fades (You Tube video ends for instance) after about 20 seconds the headset blares static and it needs to be turned off and set back on the base to reset.. also have to unplug the cable from the computer to the base. When it works, the audio is pretty good but the frustration factor makes this a horrible purchase. Highly recommend NOT buying this headset -more frustrating than convenient. This morning the headset wouldn't sync up at all which reminded me to finally post this review.Also, the headset is rather large and the contact points are slick so if you want something to listen with while being active (besides sitting) I'd find something else. It is comfortable but if you are doing dishes while listening then it may end up in the sink -not that I'd cry if the thing was ruined."
3,Good.....but,"I purchased my first Sennheiser RS 120 a couple of years ago and it has worked great exceeding expectations by delivering a clear, crisp consistent sound. The new one also works just as well but not while the first one is in use in another room connected to another TV. The sounds conflict with each other. In other words the units work well separately and independently but they cannot be used at the same time by two different people, connected to two different TV's. Bottom line is that if you have two of these headphones in the same house the sounds from both units bleed into each other. Something to consider if you intend to use two Sennheiser RS 120 headphones in the same house."
1,Lemon,"I bought this based on reviews, upgrading from Sony wireless headphones, for TV use. Comfort - outstanding. Everything else - Horrible. The unit would go off after being plugged in after only a few seconds, tried it various places in the house, and eventually returned it. Glad I bought it on Amazon, where I could return easily. Went back to the Sony brand."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this product thinking that I could put the TV in ""mute"" and continue to enjoy the programs. However, it doesn't work in mute mode and often cuts off even when the volume is 1/3 of full volume. At this sound level, I don't need a wireless headphone, so making this product practically useless for the purpose I bought it for.Sounds great though if working properly."
2,Terrible Instructions!,"When I FINALLY was able to set these up, they seem to work well. The instruction sheet was awful!! Step one - establish necessary connections. OK, and those would be???? There should be a description and picture of each component - I'm clearly technically challenged, but it would have saved me some time to dig out the power supply for the transmitter had I known it was in the box! The charging cradle feature is great, had it been explained more clearly. Set up shows only to connect to audio out. I know there are several devices you can use these with, stereo, TV, PC, etc. Would it be too much to ask to show some set up options, say with a home theater system, or to mention that you may have to turn your TV audio down so you only hear through the headphones? My initial impression of sound, range etc is good, but honestly I'm too frazzled from the frustration of setting these up with useless instructions!"
4,Worth it for a reasonable price.,"Bought these a while back for a steal at $60. Work great in the bedroom. I initially had a problem with wireless interference but changing the channel fixed the issue. I could actually hear my neighbor on her cordless phone! No other interference problems.Pros:Great price.Build endurance is great. (bought these back in 2009)Charging is so easy. (no issues with battery life since purchase)Cons:Feel a little bulky at times.Extended periods of time are a pain on the ears. (as with MOST headphones)I ended up giving these to my mom recently and she loves them. For someone who doesn't need anything special, and something for basic listening then these are a great buy for ~60$."
2,Sennheiser RS 120,I sent the product back. My husband was not pleased with it. Not a clear sound. Music is real important to my husband.
2,"Comfortable, except the loud hiss when no signal","Very comfortable, but a bit loose on head, if you lean forward t0hey often fall off. The sound quality is good, but I often have trouble getting a good signal (maybe some interference on my end). The worst part of these headphones is when the cpu is no longer sending a sound signal a loud static hiss starts, because the base unit has an auto-shutoff (which cannot be disabled). These are not a good set of headphones if you fall asleep."
4,Sennheiser El;ectronic RS120 Wireless Stereo Headphones,"I really like the Sennheiser RS120 wireless stereo headphones. Now I can watch television with my wife without fighting over the volume because I can control my own volume. With the headphone, I can make out what is being said much more clearly than before because of my hearing hearing lost. Now I can hear about 95 percent of the conversation compared to about 50 percent without the headphones. I only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't stay on my head as well as I would like."
3,Tend to slip off head,"1/1/2011 If you plan to move around while wearing these headphone be aware that they will slip off when you look down. You tune them like an old AM radio. They work best if you give them a full day to charge. The Sony headphones are a better choice, they have automatic tuning, auto on/off and stay on your head if you move around."
3,wireless tv sound,"This is my second unit of this kind. The first was more expensive, but had better features. The earpads were cushioned and deeper, and the controls were easier to operate.For the price, I feel that this set is entirely adequate, and I am enjoying the use of the unit."
3,Sennheiser RS-120,"The unit I got arrived with only one of the two headphones working. So far we have been unable to get an email response from Sennheiser. Hopefully we can send it back (at our expense, I suppose) and get a replacement. The one side that works sounds great, however. I think their quality control could use some improvement."
1,Really disappointing,"I bought these because I currently own another pair of Sennheiser headphones and they sound great. This item was a real disappointment. The power cord did not attach properly and would turn on and off with the slightest jiggle. When I could get them to work, the sound was too much like listening to FM radio station from too far away. All in all, really poor quality. I sent it back as soon as I could."
4,WORTH THE MONEY!,"I'LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET... THESE WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE GREAT! I MAINLY USE THEM TO PLAY MY PS3 GAMES AT NIGHT... YOU CAN EASILY PAY ALOT MORE IF YOUR INTO ALL THE ""NAME-BRANDS"" OR ""HAVING THE LATEST VERSION""... OR IF YOUR LIKE ME AND DONT REALLY CARE FOR ALL THAT, GET THESE YOU WONT REGRET IT!"
4,They are just about the best you can get for the kind of money you are paying,"I bough the RS210 type and to be honest I had a hard time setting up the headphones initially because I kept getting this spotty static kinda sound which stayed whatever I tired. I even wrote an email to the Sennheiser guys, but just after I sent out the email, I discovered a little white knob at the front lower edge of the base unit. It says ""CHANNEL"". It is quite small, almost invisible. I tweaked with this knob, changed it to another position and BAM! the static sound was gone. Now the sound is almost as clear as if I am using wired headphones.Now I truly believe the product deserves all the positive surveys it has gathered. For anyone who is on the fence thinking about buying this thing, I'd encourage them to buy it."
3,Eh...okay,Best quality for the cheapest price I could find. Not real comfortable. The sound is decent by the volume adjust doesn't work so great.
1,What Is This?,"These Headphones REALLY got me pumped for Father's Day when I received them, I noticed the stand seemed to be missing. I have so far spent three days hooked these up to two computers, my Tv and get static and some sort of digital signal that chirps in and out. I had a pair of no name thirty dollar headphones that blew these away. Keep shopping, I'm putting these in the return box.I have heard no actual recognizable audio from these."
3,Wireless Headphones,"These headphones were my third pair, having worn out two other brands. I was hoping to get a top quality product from Sennheiser. My Sharp headphones were the best that I ever owned, great fit and sound quality with ear covering cushions. These Sennheiser units work well have OK sound but are lacking much bass response. They are ill fitting and I too, have had trouble with them falling off my head with the slightest downward movement. In all fairness, I am bald and that may affect the fit as my son, with a full head of hair, has no trouble keeping them on his head. If the Sennheiser RS120 units had over the ear cushions and better ergonomics I would rate them as 4-5 star. I wish they had a LED indicating whether on or off it would also be nice. All in all, I give them an OK rating but not as great as Sennheiser's reputation."
2,set.up,"Setup instructions are not clear. Unable to figure out what equipment to connect the base to. TV, cable box, surround speakers?????????????"
5,more harmony,"Headphones bring harmony. I can watch sports and movies at volume levels that work for me while my wife can set her own sound comfort level, maybe even mute."
2,At a loss,"I just received my pair today, set them up and still unable to get them to work? I have placed everything where it needs to go, checked and recheck and yet still nothing! I'll give this one more day to charge up and then if that fails I'll have to return for a refund! I'm going to be optimistic though. Amazon hasn't failed me yet."
3,help for the hearing impaired,"We bought this product for my hard-of-hearing father-in-law. He would continually crank up the TV to 99! (That's as high as it would go.) My mother-in-law was going crazy! This solved the problem, BUT...I had to add an additional set of stereo speakers (Harmon-Kardan computer speaker set.)connected to a mini-plug ""Y"" adapter from his TV's headphone jack. His TV had no auxiliary audio out on the back. (RCA. I probably would have run into the same situation even if it did.) The problem was that once something was connected to the 1/8"" mini-plug headphone jack, all audio from the TV speakers was disabled. If my mother-in-law wished to watch the same show as her husband, she was not able to hear it. Now they can adjust their own separate levels. Peace has been restored.Just be advised when purchasing this or any other add-on headphones."
4,Head size,I am a woman and the headphones are just too big for me. -slipping every time my head moves. Solved by piece o9f elastic from earphone to earphone around back of head. C ontrols fiddly. Rest good
4,Sennheiser Wireless Headphones,"I bought the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones mostly for the convinience of listening to music without the hassle of carrying around my ipod. The headphones itself is okay, everything works as advertised, the only problem that I have with the headphones itself is the volume control on the headphones. I always have a problem finding it while wearing the headphones. Once in awhile the headphones will lose reception, but I just tune the reception dial on the headphones (if I can find that also while wearing it). I did some online research on the internet before I bought these, and for the price that Amazon.com had it for, I really can't complain, especially for getting a name brand product like Sennheiser."
3,OK but not great.,"The headphones are adequate. If you need mobility and reasonably good sound these are a good value for the effort. They do not reproduce high quality sound by any stretch of the imagination. The real drawback is the distortion that occurs at higher level volume and the speakers in headphones are not sufficient to create good bass. Great for listening to movies. Poor if you want hifidelity for music. A good frame of reference would be comparing them to good (not great) conventional wired headphones. These wireless headphones would rate about a ""6"" in comparison."
4,Sennheiser RS-120,"It was a bit of a hassle connecting to an old TV that didn't have a monitor port. Connecting to our newer TV was a snap.Only downside: I didn't realize the RS-20 only had open foam ear pieces. I have another Sennheiser model that has the full ear pieces, fully enclosing the ear. They do a much better job of filtering out background noise.But all in all, a great value."
4,very satisfied,"really nice for the price. Great value. I bought it so my Girlfriend could sleep in a little on the weekends while I had the music or tv at the volumes I enjoy. They sound so good that I've been using them when she's awake. We live in a condo so if we're watching tv's in different rooms, one of us can use the headphones so we don't have dueling tv's anymore."
4,I can hear everything great!,"These are wonderful headphones. The sound is very clear and good volume. They fit well, too. The cradle for them has a nice look to it. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the tuning button is located so that I occasionally bump it while leaning in my high back chair and it moves."
1,This is crap,Cheap plastic base. Cheap ear piece covers. No charge light indication when headphones are fully charged. These are three reasons why these headphones should MSRP for $49.99 and be sold on Amazon.com for $19.99. Only then would the product match the price; I feel very duped.
4,"So happy with it, I bought a second one for another tv room","After wasting a lot of money, I decided to try once more with this brand. I really didn't want to spend this much, but I was to the point of being too frustrated to even watch tv because I couldn't hear the dialogue. FINALLY... I can hear most dialogue over the background music, and the reception is pretty clear. It doesn't sound like a radio thats not quite on the station. My only complaint is that every time I get up, bend over, etc., they fall off. That can get quite aggravating at times. They are definitely worth the money, I bought a second pair for the bedroom."
2,Static hiss,"+ It basically works. I plugged it into my Roku player so I can watch shows while my girlfriend studies.- There is frequently interference, like a static hiss. This happens almost every time, regardless of the volume settings. It is not due to range...I sit about six feet from the transmitter. This huge negative overshadows any other issue, such as fit, price, or sound quality, none of which are stellar anyway."
1,What a shock!,"I ordered these headphones from Amazon. Quick delivery. I have to say I was shocked when I unpacked them. Absolutely cheap plastic junk. I thought because they were of German design the device would be of quality materials. Wrong. I plugged in the 9VDC power supply (very cheap looking) and observed a green led power light. When I unplugged and plugged the connector back into the unit, no power light. Tried several times. I boxed them up and sent them back the same day. I must say Amazon really takes care of the return shipping in a very hassle-free way. I would order from Amazon again with no reservations."
5,Awesome Wireless Headphones,"I've read all the reviews (1 star & 5 stars) before deciding to give this a try. Set this up with the hotel's TV (Philip) in Florida and couldn't get it to work. Back home connected it to the satellite box, works right away, without any tuning or adjustment. The sound is so clear & crisp, works even in the next room (concrete walls), charging station is simple to use, the only fault I can find is that the ear parts do not really ""envelope"" the ears."
4,Good wireless phones,"Good wireless phones; somewhat heavy, but to be expected (with rechargeable batteries, receiver, etc. Good tonal response. These are RF, not IR: little interference, no need for ""line-of-sight""; Excellent range: get reception anywhere in or out of house. Good length of time on one charge: have never drained batteries. Bought a second set: one for TV in living room, one for music everywhere else."
3,great sound but not there yet,"The sound is very clear, you can hear all the details but it lacks bass which may cause a problem for movies with a lot of action in it. I recommend this for music lovers but not for movie lovers."
3,"Works, but too much static hiss","The headphones work fine and the sound quality is reasonable. I found the charger base to be very convenient well worth the small cost difference from the cheaper model.BAD:1. There's a lot of low volume noise, and it's extremely noticeable when the music volume is low or there's a short break (say, in classical music). Although there's a tuning knob, the noise doesn't really ever go away.2. The headphones fit fine, but they don't stay on your head well you move around. Simply by turning my head they slide around a little. This isn't that bad, but I can't look down with them on or they fall on the floor.For the money they aren't bad, buying again I would get a digital set that go around the ear instead of these."
1,a disappointingly problematic device,"Most importantly, I couldn't get it to operate properly. The instructions were sparse, and I unsuccessfully tried every possible connection to get this unit to function. Additionally, the headphone and charging cradle system required endless fiddling to get a working connection that soon went away, so the batteries would not recharge."
2,Wireless headphone waste,"My son in law said this was a good product. There was always a ""shhhh"" in the background. I used it while I exercised on the bike. I could hear but it didn't have the quality that was reported. My husband and son in law could not make it clear of the ""shhhh"" sound."
2,Not much help in increasing audio levels,"They do not increase the sound level sufficiently. I would not recommend them to people with impaired hearing. They should be marked ""not intended for hearing impaired.""W.P. Van Hornwpvanhorn@comcast.net"
1,strikeout.,"Horrible hissing sound.Range no more than 6 feet directly in front of sending unit. Any appliance/light turned on in house caused loud crackling noise as did turning head. Returned as faulty for I can't imagine these being sold working like this. Tried everything instruction sheet said to no avail. My equipment is good quality,Pioneer/Bose and works great. Back to my old Sony headphones wire and all.Wish these had worked for the freedom of movement."
1,Not so hot,I live in the city & there is massive interference. VERRY loud interference. ALL the time. I have a place in the country. I will try it there.
3,mejor comprar otro,la verdad esque este equipo se ve interesante y los es pero la verdad lo que las personas buscan en este tipo de aparato es el sonido.es pecimo se puede decir que igual al que compras en la tienda de un chino sin discriminar la calidad de sonido terrible pero facil de cargar esta interesantisimo pero el sonido terribleSennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradlelos uso pero quiero comprar otros que tengan buen sonido
4,Great Product,This is a great product. The sound quality is great and it is well worth the money. My only criticism is that I wish it automatically muted the TV when the headphones are in use.
5,"Sennheiser RSl20, Way To Go! Yes!","This product is of exceptional quality; I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend the headphones. They boast clarity, comfort and do exactly the job I wished. The price was right, ordering was simple, delivery was timely. World Wide Stereo, I'll be a return customer and recommend you highly!"
1,"Great idea, poor execution","I love the idea of these headphones. And when they have worked, I have been happy with them. The acoustic quality of our media area is not great so my wife really likes how they make it easier to hear and underatand movies. I am reasonably happy with sound quality.My problem with them is reliability. The first set I received was deader than a wedge right out of the box. I sent those back and received a replacement set. It worked immediately. We have used this set perhaps a dozen times in the approximately two months we have had them. Now this set is dying, working only intermittently.I am not impressed with the quality control of these units.....the failure rate of those delivered to me has been 100%. I cannot recommend them."
2,Mostly Work As Advertised; One Major Problem,"I won't go over too many details, since there are over 1000 reviews and I mostly agree with them. However, I just wanted to weigh in on one flaw: the ""auto-off"" feature on the base causes these headphones to periodically blast the wearer with loud static if they stop listening to audio but continue to wear the headphones for a few minutes. I find that I do this fairly often without really thinking about it, so this flaw is really annoying, even though it could have been very easily fixed in several different cost-efficient ways.Also, I don't think they fit especially well. They're comfortable, but the parts that cover the wearer's ears are completely flat and can easily slide off if I tilt my head down. No adjustments seem to fix this (as far as I know, I have a normal, non-mutant head, so this probably applies to others, too)."
1,DO NOT BUY,"These were absolutely terrible. The annoying buzzing sound in the background while you listen to anything was not my major concern, as the headphones are wireless, and you can expect some reception interference. The major problem is that it took about a year before the reception almost completely stopped working, and the volume nob, if even slightly bumped, causes all of the sound to stop coming out of the left ear speaker. In short, I have found more durable headphones at a dollar store."
5,I'm happy,"I'm using them with my computer. I'm not an expert, but I think they sound awesome. Reception is very clear. Sound is great. I read some reviews about the controls being in an odd place or too close together. I don't think it's a big deal at all. I supposed it could be an issue if I was laying down, but I am at a desk. Charging station is very cool and compact. I am very happy with these. I almost went with the RS130's or RS140 but I am glad I save the money and went with these (RS120's)."
2,Over-priced with bugs,"These guys are ripping you off with the inflated price because there is no one else in the market to make such a simple device.This particular model does not even have digital tuning so you always end up moving the tune knob and have to constantly adjust tuning. This is specially because the tuning and volume control knobs are in the back and if you are in your bed, those knobs rub against the pillow and move all the time. I would expect a digital tuning method on a wireless headphone which cost fifty plus bucks. I personally would not recommend these unless they cost less than thirty bucks. They dont even turn off when no signal is received so they end up loosing their charge every day if you want to use them before sleeping.My headphones started having volume knob static problems only after 1 year. And the head strap broke in the middle. So not very well built."
1,Auto Off Sensor Defective?,"Great phones - when they work. The transmitting unit repeatedly shuts down in the middle of music or TV, even when the source is at adequate volume. Not useable. If the unit is not defective, it needs an auto off bypass switch or sensitivity control. Too bad. Returning - hope it is not recycled to another buyer."
3,Good,"I bought this for watching the TV. The sound quality is amazing. I like the head set overall. The only problem is, you have to tune every time you power on the headset. It will not save the frequency once you set it.Good for those who want to watch TV or play games with best sound."
4,Good product,Good product. The recharging station is a very good idea. Headphones are comfortable and adjustable. Best of all I can walk around the house and hear my favorite shows while the TV is on mute. I should have bought these years ago.
5,Sennheiser RS120,"First of all I've tried many headphones but this is my first wireless ones.I LOVE them. I live in a apartment with paper thin walls and the neighbors complained about my loud tv.Not anymore.The sound is better then from my home system.I was amazed at the bass as well as the high ends.Vey comfortable and I can wear them for hours.The only downside is they cut off after about five minutes of silence,but with all the upsides I can live with that.A good product for the price,you can't go wrong with these.I give them 5 stars."
3,Proper fit was impossible for me,Had hoped for more with these. They worked fine and sounded very nice but there is very little in the way of adjustments. Just the extension of each ear piece. But the angle and curvature could not be adjusted so they always seemed off kilter. Spoiloed by my Grado's maybe?
4,"High Quality, but a little difficult to charge","These headphones came as advertised:- High Quality/Not Flimsy- Long Battery Life- Clear ReceptionI have a minor complaint about the charger -- as opposed to a previous reviewer who mentioned that getting the headphones to charge was no problem, I had to fiddle with my headphones on the charger for a while before they began charging. That said, these headphones need charging so infrequently, who cares?Also, to note, I got these headphones on Amazon for ~$75 and I have noticed they are now $99 -- not sure about the reason for the price increase."
5,ear opening,"these headphones are AWESOME. I work nights, my roommate days.. wonderful to be able to watch a movie/TV and HEAR IT.. great quality. (you can even hear the 'peepers' in the background very clearly). I recommend this to everyone"
2,Overrated,"These headphones are far overrated. After reading the reviews and seeing the markdown in price, I was sucked into purchasing them. The sound quality is poor, and the wireless reception is subject to interference at distances > 10 feet, no matter which channel you choose to transmit on. If you enjoy listening to music with no bass, and are just looking for a cheap pair of wireless headphones, then these are for you. I am disappointed."
5,A great value for the money!,These are worth a look if you want to watch TV without disturbing anyone. Took a while to install but once it's hooked up I was surprised how clear they sound. I walked out to the mailbox which is about 100' away from the receiver and they didn't lose the sound. I should have bought a 2nd pair for the guest bedroom. Don't know how long the battery life is but other than that no problems with these!
5,Great product,"These are so good. Sometimes the surround sound is so real that I sometimes think there is a noise in the next room but is actually on the program I am watching. So clear and really kind of wierd to be able to walk into another room or outside with these on. Never have had to worry about the length of use, usually fall asleep but they keep on going...,,,better product than I expected!!"
2,"The controls are too difficult to work and the ""tune"" control goes on and off.","I have had a lot of trouble with the controls. When it's set properly, the headphones sound great! It's just difficult to get them set there. Also, when there is no signal (before a video comes on or after it's done) the headphones hiss loudly."
2,Picking up RF Noise,"I purchased this set based on the reviews. My use case is to use it with my TV in the bedroom. For testing purposes I tried two setups.1. Connect to my family room home theater system using the provided AV cable2. Connect to my bedroom TV using the provided AV cableWhile connected to the Family room home theater system the Sennheiser RS120 performed very well. There was no extra bass nor extra treble. But, whenever I turned my head I would hear a drop in volume.While connected to the bedroom TV though I can constantly hear an interference noise. I moved the Sennheiser to multiple positions within the reach of the AV cable, yet I could not avoid the noise. The audio quality was good but the constant hissing noise made me return the set.I hope they have sets that are insulated better for the RF noise (is there such a thing?)"
3,Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones,"The Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones work okay but they are pretty touchy. I don't know if the issue is the audio out cable or the audio out jack but it takes a bit of patience to make the headphones work but once I did they work to my satisfaction. The RS120 headphones are not extremely comfortable but they aren't uncomfortable either, they just are. The wireless signal seems to depends on your position more than I would have liked. While I can get up and walk around without normally losing the signal, there are times that a simple turn of the head causes the signal to drop. While I would not trust my life to the reliability of these headphones they work just fine not waking the family in the middle of the night when I can't sleep."
2,Not worthy of the Sennheiser name,"I have 10 different pairs of different Sennheiser headphones and they are all AWESOME. I have owned the HDR130 for several years and they are outstanding. I thought the only difference between these (HDR120) and the HDR130 was the surround sound feature. Not so..... These are much smaller hence do not fully encompass your ears. Rather than a frequency switch, these have a frequency dial. Finally, the sound is OK at low volumes but distorts badly at mid to higher volumes. The sleep mode did not work either. These may have been a defective set, but I really do not want to take the chance with another pair. Back they go."
2,Ear cups not comfortable,"Works ok, decent sound, minimal interference, but thin cover material and relatively heavy weight make for uncomfortable on-ear wearing experience."
4,Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Head Phones,"I received my head phones finally after rather slow shipping. I am very happy with the product. Only criticism is the fact that if you move around or try to do anything where you move your head very much, they fall off all too easy. The sound is great."
5,Great Headphones,"I recently purchased the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones. I have been very pleased. They have an outstanding sound quality, very clear all around my office area (psst...you can wear them to the bathroom). I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs to have quality sound, reasonable price and no wires."
5,Sennheiser Headphones,These headphones were recommended by a friend. Excellent sound quality and more comfortable to wear than ear buds. We have recommended them to others.
1,Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle,I recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser Rs 120 wireless headphones that I used while watching TV (I have a hearing problem). I was replacing a pair of Sennheiser TR 140 because the headset arm cracked in the middle between the two ear pads. The Rs 120 are ok headphones just to give you the audio but the clarity and quality of the sound pales in comparison to the TR 140. I would not recommend you purchase these headphones (cost around $80.00) just to get the audio. You can get the same result from a cheaper set. The Rs120 was a great headphone but unfortunately the head piece is too brittle and is prone to crack.
5,Listening wherever in comfort at last.,"I was saving up my Coke rewards for this product but was not prepared to wait 2.5 years so my wife bought me them for Christmas, after I had read all the reviews good and bad. Happily I am delighted with the gift. Tuning rarely requires a tweek and the sound is clear and well balanced. I love being able to sit outside and listen whilst enjoying the garden. I also learned that I won't miss phone calls....the scream that interrupts the music is an effective ring tone. I can put up with that as our phone does not ring too often. Overall, a very pleasing purchase."
2,"disappointed with Sennheiser, doesn't live up to its reputation","well, got the product and tried it, it has lots of background hissing sound, to get rid of the hissing sound, seems like I will have to tune it slightly off, but then you won't pick up the good sound reproduction if you do that. So if you tune it so that it pick up all the instrument, it tends to have background hissing sound. ya, if you turn up the volume, it will ""suppressed"" the hissing sound, but that is not a good headphone should do."
1,Crazy Interference,"I hate this headset, but after 90 bucks I refuse just to throw them away. I tried all possible frequencies and its impossible to hear 1 single song without the annoying interference noise. So I keep trying to use them, which makes me hate them even more. Do not buy this."
2,ugh,"yeah, they're nifty while they workhad mine for a short time and barely (3-5 times a month) use them and now they don't hold a charge.also, some idiot thought a loud white noise was the best thing to pump through these when the signal drops below a certain threshold...like an extended quiet scene in a movie.yeah, great job guys. hire some testers.EDIT:Screaming static when the volume drops below a certain threshold. Not just the RF signal. Yay for trying to relax with something chill at a low level....then SKREEEEEE! SKITCH SKITCH SKITCH SCREEE!Sennheiser, the words I want to use for your product I'm sure I am not allowed to say here."
2,51010jm,"very uncomfortable ear pads, I still use old set that has cut away for ears o/w good product"
1,Short Life,The product did not function after merely a week of useSennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle
4,Great until they Broke,"When they expired, I bought a new set from Amazon. Unlike other reviewers on Amazon, I am not going to talk about my shipping experience, which was great. Nor I will go into intro great detail from people who are obviously engineers and are obsessed with how they should have been designed. Get back to the lab, fellas, break is over.My review is: They worked great and broke. I'm getting another pair. If this pair breaks, I'm not getting another pair of HS-120's.I will put my change in my change jar and buy a pair of RS-130's when I get enough. If these break after a short period of use, that mean the factory in China has a problem and I don't want to be a guinea pig for them.I'll get another brand other than Sennhauser. End of review.Whoops, this was more than a review wasn't it? This monologue shows some of the characters we bipolars have. We talk to long, to loud, and to much. And we digress. Kinda like engineers."
2,Works with iPod and CD player but not TV,"My wife has a chronic illness that makes it difficult for her to go to sleep, so she usually watches TV until she drops off. I recently bought a Sony KDF50WE655 HDTV for the bedroom and bought these headphones for her to use so I can get some sleep. They don't work with the TV regardless of the base station channel selection. Although there is no mention in the Amazon listing for the headphones, the minimal user manual notes that they will not work if connected to some TVs. I tried it with extra long cables to get the transmitter away from the TV but still just static. I have tried it with my iPod and with a stand alone CD/DVD player and it works fine with them."
1,My bad decision,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle. The charger never worked. It is just not worth the problems of mailing back.
5,Best purchase I've made in a long while.,"I have about stopped watching TV because even with my hearing aids, and the TV volume up high, I couldn't hear the soft spoken words and ""missed"" half of the movie. Now, with the headphones, I hear every word clearly and don't disturb my wife because I can turn the volume all the way down. I can wonder all over the house and still hear everything. I highly recommend this item. Only complaint, as many have made, they fit loose on my head, but I can certainly live with that."
1,Don't bother,"I had high hopes for this product as I really wanted to be able to watch tv without outside noise interfering. Regrettably, it was not to be. I tried the headphones on three different tv sets. I got nothing but static on any of them. At least their customer service is good and they took the headphones back without argument."
5,High quality wireless headphones,"I have used these headphones for the past two months and am endlessly pleased with them. They took a few days to get just right--you can change the channel as well as tune them within a channel, so make sure to get the settings right. The sound quality on cable TV, DVD's, audio and so on is first rate...not quite as good as wired headphones, but close. The range is excellent--sometimes I go outside and wash the car while listening to something (sports) that doesn't require every minute in front of the picture. Great product."
4,Very Good But Not Great,"These headphones are good for late night TV watching or music listening when the family is sleeping. Quality is good and they work well throughout the house and outside up to about 30 feet. Sound quality is good, not great. The rechargeable batteries will save enough money to pay for the headphones in time. Although I am a large man, the headphones felt loose and sometimes fell off when I moved suddenly. Other than that I can find no faults.I highly recommend these Sennheisers."
4,Good product,"PROS:- Very good sound quality- Light weight- Very good batteries autonomyCONS:- small range of the radio signal: if you're at about 10 meters from the base in an apartment (where some walls always get in the way), you'll experience a severe loss of quality.- rotative tuning knob in the unit: since it has only 3 channels to choose, it should be a key with 3 positions, just like the base. Maybe it's for costs saving (they avoid using a more complex and precise tuning circuitry). It's annoying to have the signal lost by accident when you're trying to turn down the volume..."
3,Great Range but not the most Comfortable,While the headphones have great range they aren't as comfortable as the other Sennheiser headphones I've worn and sometimes I can hear static. Also if you do a lot(more than walking around and such) of moving around be prepared to have them slip off.
4,Being nice to sleepers at night,I purchased these to hear TV at night while others were sleeping in my home. First pair had shorted out and returned them to sender(store).They sent another and they are working good. Helps the household !
2,hissing and hurting,"I purchased these headphones because I hate having cords strung over the floor to my couch. I live in an apartment building, and I was aware from reading the reviews that interference might be an issue. The first time I used them, I picked up some sort of radio program when tuning. I finally found the correct tuning to listen to my tv program. There is a lot of background hiss in these headphones, even when correctly tuned. Now, that may be expected from wireless headphones, BUT it gets worse!When you lose the signal, or when you pause your dvd player for a few minutes, you will get an eardrum shattering HISS unexpectedly and much much louder than the background hiss which is present all the time. So if you value your hearing, don't pause your DVD player while wearing these!"
4,Great for watching tv,"Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)Great for tv. My wife complained about the tv volume, so I bought the RS120 headphones by sennheiser. Now we have a peaceful home again. At first I had a problem with the headphones shutting off if the tv volume is low. I finally found a way for them to work. This is the only fault I found with this product."
4,they do the job,"These headphones seem to do the job. I bought them as a gift for my dad. He likes to watch tv in bed but doesn't want to wake up my mother. He said they work great, no complaints. They did seem a bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Affordable Quality,"I purchased these as a Christmas gift after checking out Sony and a couple others. Sennheiser has a strong reputation and the price was great. They were simple to set up and the sound is clear and full. The range is also excellent. My wife uses them to watch TV while she is on her exercize equipment. They are comfortable for her and she is very happy with them. Although Sony is also a great brand, the price on Amazon and reputation of Sennheiser caused me to make the right decision. We are very pleased with these wireless headphones."
4,Nice,"These have great sound quality, and are very comfortable. The annoying static or hiss that people refer to in other reviews only occurs when it is not receiving a signal, so if you put them on while your system is off you'll hear static, or if you don't have the headset tuned to the transmitter properly (this is really easy to do since the tuner control is right on the headset)."
4,"So Far, So Good","Haven't used them much, but I'm pretty pleased. The only complaint is having to manually tune them yourself, or else there will be tons of static. Great price. Not sure you can get a better pair for less money."
2,Not for me,"Headphones are well built, and the sound quality is awesome. Great clarity and base, however, in my opinion, there's a design flaw that prevents these from being practical.The ear cushions are flat instead of hollow, so they press against the ears, instead of surrounding them, making them very uncomfortable, and after about 30 minutes my ears started to hurt. They also get pretty warm, perhaps for the same reason. It's a shame because the sound was great.Tried to like them and wish they would have fit better, but unfortunately I will have to look elsewhere."
2,Unsure yet...,"We got this headset with high expectations as we heard that it is a great item for my mothers TV watching and her very bad hearing. But it is not compatible with our flatscreen (2009) Panasonic TV, and we have been trying (Best Buy, Radio Shack) since we bought the headset (August 23) to find a convertor that will make it work. We now have had something thru a hard core electronics store, that Panasonic told us to get, on order for 3 weeks and it still hasn't come in! Oh, my poor mother!!It would have been good to have know ahead of time what one would need to purchase to make the headset work with the most popular TV sets, so we wouldn't have to go thru this."
3,Ok,"I was given these as a gift and they were purchased on amazon.I was given these because I am a disaster when it comes to things with cords, especially headphones. The sound quality is amazing but not worth the awful fit. Unless you sit upright and sit still they move horrible and constantly fall off. And after awhile there is a buzz that does not go away."
1,"When no audio is playing, there is a horrible hum. Also falls off your head easily","When no audio is playing, there is a horrible hum. Also falls off your head easily.Otherwise it is fine. Will not be using these for any longer"
3,Stay close,"They fit good,are very comfortable. You can wear them for a long time with no discomfort. Battery life is very good. The controls are good as well. The one problem I have is when you get more then 30 feet away or go into another room. You occasionally get these sharp clicking, crackling and poping attacks. No matter what volume your playing them at , these attacks come in at FULL volume. But if you stay close..."
3,JUST OKAY (FOR MY PURPOSES),"Not Sennheiser's best effort here. Like many other reviews, my biggest complaint is that these headphones will fall off your head at the blink of an eye. But I only use them for watching TV in bed. I am also disappointed in the sound, i.e. - rather muffled, too much bass, voices not as clear as they should be. I also have the RS130 headphones, and they are MUCH better. I had the RS140 headphones before I got these two sets, and the sound and fit were fantastic. However, they malfunctioned after about a year of use. Sennheiser stood behind them but, unfortunately, they no longer made the RS140. So they replaced them with the 130. I would love to have another 140, but they are very rare."
4,good wireless value,"Sound quality - very goodEase of use - excellentFit - adequate, although not adjustable for tightness. They can fall off if you look down too far. Otherwise, these would rate 5 stars.Range - excellentValue - very good."
5,Just as Advertised,"My husband is hard of hearing and watching TV with him was a battle of volume control. He has TV Ears but the batteries were always going out and you must face the receiver or lose the sound. Further more TV ears held you hostage by having to buy from them a replacement battery. I was looking for something different. Sennheiser RS120 was more money, but you are able to walk around and still hear your show. So far, so good and would highly recommend them."
2,Power saving features annoy,"When they work, they sound decent and are comfortable. In my office environment, however, I can't get away from annoying background noise, on all the channels and with every conceivable transmitter position.What's more annoying, however, is that if there is no audio going to the transmitter, it shuts off. I use these on computer that makes infrequent noises when I'm not listening to music - so this happens very frequently. When it does happen, the headphones just start amplifying background noise, louder and louder, until I have to take them off. There needs to be a control to disable this, or the headphones need to be smart enough to shut off when the transmitter is off."
