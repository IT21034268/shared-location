3,A good start.,"Why it was decided that the longest Harry Potter book should become the shortest movie, I will never understand. Well, maybe I do understand: greed. It's certainly cheaper to produce a shorter film!Throughout the plot development was uneven. I sometimes wondered what happened to many of the incidents from the book which would have tied the action together. The Devil is in the details: we never did find out what that arch in the Ministry really was, and we should have. But that is only one of the shortcomings of the film.Read the book before you see the film, so that the film makes sense."
5,just wild about harry,"My family has already watched the DVD 4 times. Love to see all the details that I didn't catch while the movie was in the theater. This is one of the few movies my whole family can agree on. We enjoyed the books, but we love the movies."
5,The Magic of Harry Potter,"The only downside to any of the Harry Potter stories is the extent to which the author required the movie to follow the book as much as possible. Given the size of book 5, it was understandable that some of the original story had to be cut. Even so, this was a fun and entertaining movie to watch .. as was all of the movies in this series."
5,Shortest of the longest,"The book of Order of the Phoenix is the longest of the series, and yet this movie is the shortest of the 5 so far made. That sounds terrible, but in reality, although they left out a lot of details, the actual action moves too slowly in the novel. Still there are several important details left out or changed. Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is not quite edgy and evil enough - but then that character gave me the most visceral response I have ever had to a character in a novel.The direction is swift and the acting great. My real problem is with Nicholas Hooper's music. It does not go anywhere. There are only one or two decent themes, and the rest is accompaniment in the most noodlie fashion. I recommend the movie highly, but I hope John Williams returns for the last movie. (Hooper is already writing Half-Blood Prince)."
4,the phoenix,Not as good as the book but still a good movie. It is hard to turn a 700 page book into a 2 hr movie. The Phoenix is full of details. Go Tonks ! :)
2,Here we go again,"I am a big older Harry Potter fan. I am very disappointed in WB. I love Ultima 1 and 2 because they were extended editions, but now we have another Star War and Lord of the Ring were you have to go through a director cut ... etc. before you get the extended version some years down the line."
2,Love the book - hate the movie.,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and enjoyed every word of every book. But I absolutely hated this movie. I know a movie can never capture all of the details and character development of a book, but it still needs to stay true to the essence of the book we all have come to love. This movie depicted Dumbledore as a very grumpy, almost mean, old man who displayed none of Dumbledores lovable qualities. The movie destroyed the relationship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. It depicted Ron and Hermione as stiff cardboard figures that stood behind Harry and looked concerned. I could go on and on with things that disturbed me about this movie. But if you are a Harry Potter fan, you will have to watch it. But this fan was extremely disappointed."
3,Harry Potter,Great movie but I could have bought it at Meijers for 16.99 and had it on the day it was released. Instead I received it over a week later.
2,AMAZON WILL LOSE TO OTHER VENDORS,"Amazon has really dropped the ball on this one! As another poster said, the DVD release of this film was announced weeks ago. Other vendors have it available for pre-order. I guess Amazon needs to concede that it will lose potential sales to competitors, as rabid Harry Potter fans place their orders with other vendors."
4,pheonix,The movie is great and I needed it to complete my collection with the prospect of the movies being temporarily retired. The case was in great shape.
4,maysgrm,My granddaughter is really into Harry Potter and she was excited to receive this DVD as a Christmas gift.
1,Please go back to director/producer of first two films,"Poor. Would give 1/2 star if available. Looks exactly like someone took the characters names from the book and made their own story to show on film - and not a well-done story at that.Please go back to the director/producer of the first two movies. We would pay double or treble the money to have a well-done, accurate, albeit necessarily abbreviated, rendition of a very well-written book. And would not mind in the least sitting through a 2- or even 4-hour movie - indeed, would relish the experience.This movie is like someone ripping the hood ornament off a Rolls-Royce and putting it on a Mini-Cooper then calling it a Silver Ghost and getting mad when everyone complains about the quality of the ride. Just Not Done."
3,I can't remember watching this movie...although I know I did. I must have been drunk...or maybe the movie sucked,"I know that this series has a certain recipe, and I watched it to get a good dose of adolescent escapism after a hard day at work...I honestly can't remember the ending, but it was entertaining, so good enough."
3,It's Bored...,This movie was bored and I thought this movie was best but it's not. This movie isn't good as other Harry Potter series.
1,You have to have 3D compatibilty on DVD Player,"After purchasing and returning my first attempt with this DVD, I found out that my new SONY Blu-Ray player does not have 3D capability and therefore cannot play this DVD. I returned the first disc (thinking it was damaged in some way) and will have to return the second. I contacted the service rep for SONY and was told that SONY had no upgrades or plans to upgrade my new player to 3D (eventhough it stated in the documents of the player that they were anticipating an upgrade to 3D). DO NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE 3D CAPABILITY ON YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER. I had forgotten that this film had 3D parts in it and didn't realize it until I had returned the first DVD for not playing on my machine. I'll have to purchase the regular widescreen version in order to play this film. That's too bad, and the necessity of 3D capability should be made part of the product description for this version of THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX."
5,Harry Potter no longer a boy,"Harry Potter leads a rebellion inside Hogwarts as the dark Lord Voldemort begins recruiting an army. All is not well at Hogwarts as Dumbledoor is undermined by a Ministry of Magic psychopath and evtnually replaced as Headmaster. No one believes Harry that the dark lord is back so he must lead a rebellion in secret called ""The Order of the Pheonix"". More and more does it become clear that Harry and Lord Voldemort are connected. With the help of his godfather, Professor Snape, and other Order of the Pheonix members, Harry must fight back and vindicate both himself and Dumbledoor. New characters, like Luna Lovegood, bring an air of comic relief in a darker story than before."
5,Good Entertainment,I am from Germany. That's why this is going to be short. I don't have enough vocabulary to express what I think aout the movie. In my opinion this was a very well done movie. Very good entertainment and just worth to see it. I really hope to see the same cast in the following sixth movie!!!!! I just love it!
4,The fifth Harry Potter film should please fans of the series,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" - the fifth Harry Potter film - is the most sombre and subdued so far.It has the usual stunning special effects but there is more a focus on the characters especially Harry Potter himself who is beginning to understand the burden he bears.JK Rowling and the film-makers continue to successfully create a parallel magical universe for us to explore.Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton) is right up there with other Potter villains playing a smug Margaret Thatcher-like matron sent to tidy up Hogwarts.Harry Potter's first screen kiss plays a very small part in the film and his relationship with Cho Chang is never explored.This is not really a film for little kids but fans of the series will not be disappointed."
2,Buffering issues,The movie is the movie. Not nearly as good as the book not even close. But as a movie unto itself without comparing it to the book then it is still good. My issue is with the buffering on the HD version through Amazon. it kept stopping so much so that after the first ten minutes I just ordered it through my cable provider.
3,Briefly? Too shot and too spotty,"The book was very long. The DVD was very short. The characters were cut to ribbons, with the exception of obnoxious Umbridge who had a big part in nearly every scene. But many other scenes missing or cut badly. Plenty of action, if that's all you like. Story line? Gone."
2,DVD design poorly done for Order of Phoenix,"Think twice before ordering the two-disc Special Edition Order of the Phoenix in wide screen;the DVD-Rom stuff works poorly or not at all on Macs; the menu designs are terrible;there is no director or actor commentary; there is no real addtional information on the movieexcept an extended piece of fluff with the character Tonks; a cheesy edit your own movie bitis a waste of space. This DVD seems really thrown together in a hurry.The one good special feature is a review of all the Potter stories so far, to bring you up to date ifyou have forgotten some bits.The additional scenes are all laughable; it was a wise editor who cut them out.If you can play them, opt instead for the HDDVD or BLuRay HD version, if you just want prisitine video to watch. Unfortunately Amazon did not bother to make clear the HD version was also availablefor the same price when I pre-ordered a month ago. Sorry I wasted my money."
4,"potter, inc.","This is where the films start to blur together for me, where I can barely remember how one left off and another began. I suppose this might be the case with those who like myself are not reading the books, but it is a wonderfully entertaining experience and I never feel any lessening of enjoyment when we put these on. We are watching the entire series prior to the finale and I am again in awe of the subtle interconnections of plot, the threads of deepening themes, and mysteries to be later explained. As always, it is a pleasure to see the actors grow. This is the best series of sophisticated kids' films that I have ever seen."
4,"Lesser of the films, but worth the money.","In my opinion this is the lesser of all the Harry Potter films, as I began to loose interest after this film, thank god the 6th recaptured my attention. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 3 is bc of the bonus documentary disc showing more about making the world of Harry Potter. Its a good buy for people who enjoy special features. If all you want is the movie then don't buy it."
3,It skipped starting with the first viewing..,The movie was delivered quickly and the dvd looked buffed but it skipped in a few places. I opted not to return it but I was a little disappointed that it didn't play a bit better.
4,Great... as expected,"Book #5 was never my favorite Harry Potter book but this film is great. Some scenes might be too dark for a younger audience, but definitely great story. Buy the whole series!!"
1,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Full -Screen Edition),"I purchased this some time ago for my daughter because she likes the Harry Potter series. She did not watch the video because she was very busy working and attending college at the time. When she finally did get around to watching it, she discovered the disk was blank as it did not work at all. It was past the time for the 30 day refund, so I emailed Amazon anyway and told them what happened. I did not expect anything to come of it, but Amazon contacted me and refunded my money! I understand that sometimes these disks may get burned too quickly and an error may occur. I rated it one star because this company should be more careful. Customers order disks and expect them to work!"
4,"Great movie, lacking in the extras","This fifth installment of the Harry Potter film franchise is probably it's biggest departure in tone and style, all while being the shortest film in the series based off the longest book series. And while the stakes are up, the action is at its best, the effects are simply outstanding, and the acting all around is remarkably better, the omissions in plot this time around actually begin to seem like ""holes"". Overall, an expertly crafted film which will leave you a bit unsatisfied, and make you wish for more.As for the Special Edition features, I must say that the extras are rather light, and I feel like the producers got lazy this time around. A lot could've been done with the film, and instead we have segments that I can merely describe as filler, even though I'm pretty sure the bonus disc is hardly full at all. I have a feeling that they're saving the good stuff for the inevitable Blu-Ray edition of this DVD."
4,Love Harry Potter,"What is there to say? Love Harry Potter! This one was probably hard to make, since the book was very convoluted story plot. Great Job!!"
5,movie,Again another great epic to the Harry potter story.As always some differences in the film version vs the book version but it works.Its always interesting to see story lines come alive.Good movie.
2,The worst Harry Potter movie.,"This is the worst Harry Potter movie ever made, Too much plots removed and it was confusing for everyone who did not read the book."
3,Harry Potter & The Order of the Phoenix,"While I am a fan of the series, I was unable to understand the dialogue. The audio portion was muffled and the British accent made most of what was said unintelligble."
4,"As good as any of the ""Potter"" movies probably","Like all of the other movies this one came so long after the book that I can't remember a lot of details but the adaptation seems as ""good"" as any to me. It is, after all, a darker toned story that still managed to get details right in spite of being heavily edited down from book form. ""Goblet of Fire"" seemed to have more color in it if my memory is right, this one is dark and depressing colorwise.The ""extras"" disc is pretty much a waste of time with Tonks tour of the studio being kind of silly, not telling a person much, the editing section was the usual stuff too.I'm waiting for the next movie now."
2,Missing scenes on DVD,"I won't get into the debate of how well this compares to the book, as many others have done an excellent job of that already.My review is merely to point out that some small scenes that were shown in the theatrical version didn't make it to the DVD. For example, after Umbridge & co. blasts into the Room of Requirement, Draco hauls Cho in with him, which allows the audience to understand how they finally came upon the D.A., and the subsequent shunning of Cho by the other D.A. members. On the DVD, however, this is left out, and it's not until Snape mentions that he used veritaserum on Cho that the audience finally understands what happened.That's not the only scene that was cut, and I don't understand why they were cut, as they would only total a couple of extra minutes at most.Perhaps I have a defective DVD, but I doubt it. Did anyone else notice this??"
1,What does Ultimate actually mean?,"I have received an official response from the WB store and have verified that this is not ""the extended edition."" I knew that there were no extended cuts in existence for 3&4, so I bought those anticipating that to change for at least OotP. I do find it frustrating that the ""Ultimate Edition"" of a film who's director has repeatedly stated that WB made him cut nearly an hour of footage, does not receive the same treatment as the first and second installments of the ""Ultimate"" collection.I do love the packaging, and the extras are kind of cool, but the real reason I started investing in this set was for the extended versions.Thanks for a big tease, WB."
4,Harry's growing up!,"I think a lot of reviews missed the point of this chapter of the Potter Saga. Harry and the rest of the students are growing up. Harry's glum bitter mood is appropriate for his age and the constant stress of his life. Readers of the books will be aware of this. The instalments grow up with the cast. If J.K. Rowling and/or the films producers would have kept the ""Disneyesque"" tone of the earlier books it would have become derivitive and boring. The cutting of many of the sub plots was needed otherwise we would have been watching a 3 hour plus film."
3,Meh,"Not my favorite Harry Potter movie, but I guess if I wanted it to be just as good as the book it would would be about 6 hours long."
4,Better than the last,"Things I liked; it was better than GoF, the acting keeps getting better with every film, the ministry fights with the Order/Death Eaters and Voldemort/Dumbledore were great, I love the effects they use on the spells. Dolores Umbridge was a biatttchh, part played well. The music was good as well.What I didn't like; the beginning...the entire part up until they get inside the order's house was just horrible, the dementors looked silly, the acting was bad, the camera shots, everything. Luckily the film picks up and gets better.Not a good book adaption, a lot of good things were left out...but whatever. I've watched it three times so far so it's good enough for my enjoyment, I can always read the book again."
4,Another good adaptation of the Potter saga,"This is another well acted, well-done installation in the saga of Harry Potter. The actors who portray the new characters of Luna Lovegood and Professor Umbridge hit Rowlings' characterization of them both dead-on and they are both terrific. One thing I am really missing in the movie versions of episodes 3, 4 and now 5 is the John Williams scoring and theme music I so loved in the first 2 movies."
3,Something's missing?,"I saw the movie but when I got this dvd for xmas. I notice something's missing.... something cut... DVD did not show Hermione gave back piece to Hagrid's brother... and also did not show Sirius's cousin slide back into fireplace... I suspected... Why do that for? I feel bit rip off.And the movie itself is not enough... why make short scene on Snape's young day? Not good enough. I am sure we all want to know. I know not everyone read the book.I also notice some scenes are ""copies"" from other movie... i.e. Lord of the Ring... Santa Clause...I read some reviews and do agreed with some of them. Wish they would have done better."
3,Harry Potter DVD,"When I ordered the latest Harry Potter DVD, I expected the two disk version offered by other retailers but only received one disk with none of the other options. Other than that I was satisfied with the DVD."
4,Dark Harry Potter,The stories are getting darker and the actors are getting older and not as cuit as they used to be. The first one is still the best in the series. Lots of good extras. Amazon sent it on time and at a very good price.
2,Harry Potter and Order of Phoenix-2disc,"This was a disappointing movie and least enjoyable in series so far. If I had not read the books, would probably not have a clue as to what was going on. However, this book is the darkest and probably the hardest to translate to the screen as there is so much information past and present that needs to be sorted out and can't imagine how this 5th book in the series could be done well. Wish the last two were completed now, as this movie closes with such darkness and can't wait to see how the rest of the story is played out! Nevertheless, all the actors, actually the entire cast has done a wonderful job. People unfamiliar with the books may not see all the subtle twists and darkening atmosphere....a friend thought it was very violent and disturbing and failed to see beyond the action because so much had to be left out of the script that was in the original novel."
4,Excellent Amazon Service,"I'm a Harry fan so the product was as expected. But, the service was the treat. I placed an advance order and had the DVD in my mail on the release date. I didn't even have to wait an extra day to get it. Great Service. I love advance ordering!"
2,Not as good as previous,"We just watched the newest Harry Potter movie, ""Order of the Phoenix"". Quite frankly, I was disappointed.I had read at about the time the movie originally came out that it was directed by a different individual than the previous HP movies and that it tended to be ""darker"". I found it to be not only darker and bleaker but they had also taken the fun out of this one. I actually was anxious for the thing to end. Too bad. I've always liked the HP movies but if any further ones are directed by this guy, I think I'll take a pass."
2,No Mo Potter,"I wasn't exactly feeling this movie. I only liked ""The Chamber of Secrets"" out of all the Harry Potter films. At this point, it's like sensory overload, and overdone. It's just the same ol stuff, and the actors look like they're done, and they should be. I love the way it was filmed, but if your not a big fan of Harry potter in general, the movies are pretty dull and boring. It borders on pretentiousness, and the guy playing Harry potter needs to get over himself, you ain't all that honey!"
3,Two major flaws....,"I have not read the book but I can say that the kiss with Cho was way over-dramatized and hyped leading to the release of this film. Their relationship may have been more prominent in the book but wasn't relevant at all in the film. The other disappointment was the climatic duel, which for the most part had Harry running for cover. It was too flashy. Of course, I am a huge HP fan and will order the cd nonetheless and watch it over and over again until my eyeballs pop as I have done with all the others!! :)"
4,He's Back,"This movie adaptation of J.K. Rowlings 5th book was unfortunately a let down for me. You definitely needed to have read the book first to understand what was going on in the movie. Favorite scenes from the book were left out - Quiddich. Favorite characters - Hagrid, Creature and Tonks had very minimal parts. The movie is very dark in both cinematography and subject. The characters all have a harder edge and definitely not a children's movie. Imelda Staunton who was cast as the perfect Delores Umbridge literally steals the whole movie. Harry, Hermoine and Ron all seem to be getting a little too old for the characters that they play. The best part of the movie was the last 30 minutes, unfortunately you had to sit through the first two hours to get there."
1,absolutely horrible,"None of the Harry Potter movies have really done justice to the books, but this is the worst by far. No character development whatsoever, so many scenes cut that it's hard to tell what's going on, and the scenes that do exist go by so quickly that I feel like I'm watching a movie trailer. Why are they even bothering if this is the best they can do?The bottom line is this. Trying to turn a novel, any novel, into a movie is a stupid idea. Everybody please stop. You will never, ever do it justice."
4,awesome!,My granddaughter is the one that wanted this movie! I ordered it and it showed up quick and in great condition!!! Love Harry Potter Movies!!
1,Poison pen,"A lethal combination of bad screenwriting and hack direction. The nuances introduced in Potter movies 3 and 4 by Cuaron and Newell are jettisoned. Cuaron's sly take on book 3, his ability to suggest the pending sexual awakening of the three main characters, and the sexual ambivalence in some of the other characters, all wrapped in sinuous action, rescued the movies from the clueless Chris Columbus. Newell built on this, and brought the young actors to carefully shaded and detailed performances, performances that linger in the mind well after the FX have faded. Phoenix removes virtually every trace of character development, every trace of humor, and the spirit of fun that bubbled in the first four films is crushed in a wall of stony compositions and unfeeling visual effects. Emotionally cold and depressing, and even more depressing to find out that Yates is being brought back for the sixth film. Heaven forbid they give him the final two films. Bring back Cuaron and Newell!"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"In the opinion of this confirmed fan of the HP series, ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is by far the worst of an otherwise excellent series of movie adaptations to the HP books. In my opinion this movie is a rip off of HP fans that cashes in on our faithful enjoyment of this series and gives us a pathetic shadow of the story in return. As a author of fantasy fiction, I would be outraged by this movie's treatment of my novel if I was J.K. Rowling. The review by Gregory Bravo is 'spot on.' Nuff said. J.P. Kelly"
2,Not a great pick,"I,too,have mixed feelings about the film.It certainly has left out or completely changed certain aspects of the novel.Unlike earlier films, this one strays from the plot line of the novel in several key ways. Since I have read the series from cover to cover a number of times, I was able to fill in the gaps. However, the friends who saw it with me were not able to do that because they did not know the characters/sequence of events in great detail. I will buy the DVD simply because I own the rest of the series and want to add it to the collection. I do, however, hope the next two films in the series are of higher quality and more true to the story line than this one."
4,barley made it,"I qualified for the super saver shipping, but I wanted to be sure that it got here on time because the dvd was for a child for christmas. I paid extra for shipping to make sure it got here a few days early, but I ended up delaying my trip, to see my family, waiting for the mail. Needless to say it was LATE."
3,Ripoff! WB made the second disc disappear!,"Since when do you not get the Special Features DVD? I have the four previous movies, on Fullscreen, and they have all been 2-disc sets. Now Warner Brothers decides that since the franchise has ended, they'd better milk as much money as possible out of us? Talk about being Crucio'd!Any Dementors trying to kiss WB execs would sadly go hungry - they're soulless, it seems."
4,An adequite continuation of the series,My biggest problem with the potter series when it goes to film is that they have to leave out so much of the story.
4,Harry Potter - Phoenix,Bought this version specifically because it is WS.If you are a Harry Potter fan you gotta have it.jr
3,Great flick !- terrible DVD copy,"As a HUGE Harry Potter fan, I was eager to own the latest film. I preordered and was elated when the movie arrived. It had so many skips that I returned it for another copy. This copy is worse than the first! I have watched several over movies on my DVD player in this time frame with no issues, so I do believe it is the DVD itself.Amazon has an excellent return policy - I am just disappointed to have to go through this again."
2,problematic disc,I have just tried to watch my 2nd hd version of this movie. both times the movie has locked up at some point and we have to start over and then skip over the part where it locks up. I will take it back and try for a third disc.
5,Doesn't disappoint yet again,"Showing these movies to my small children, I was getting worried that they may be getting too dark and scary with the 3rd and 4th movies. I liked it, but thought it to be inappropriate for them at this age. However, although the subject matter was darker than some of the others, the movie handled it very well and it didn't seem quite as dark or scary. It dealt with the subject a little more lightly. I felt fine showing this one to them like I was with the 1st and 2nd movie. The take on Professor Umbridge was very creative. Not what I had in mind, but good, nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie all the way through. What's really neat is that it seems that some of these young actors and actresses have improved so much since the first movie. Anyway, that's my two cents."
1,The movie is good ; however it's the DVD that is a waste of money!,"I think the movie is okay even though it left out some major things important in the 6th and mostly 7th book, but I loved how they played up the psychology between Harry and Voldemort. However I did NOT LIKE THE DVD.The second disc is RIDICULOUS. It has four features, and editing process which is engaging for a few minutes, and then a documentary about Harry's fate that I did enjoy even though I'd seen it many times before the premiere of the 7th book. Then there was ""Tailing Tonks""It was AWFUL! I can only say it was rushed and ridiculous overview where she was turned away in minutes by ever department. You could tell David Yates and the Harry Potter Production did NOT want to spend time on this DVD. There were no engaging behind the scene views, it was discouraging! You felt like they didnt want you to see behind the scenes, that they were TO BUSY to deal with the FANS!Dont waste your moeny, get the single disc, please!"
4,Too Short,I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I think the characters should stay just as they are. The actors are getting older but so are the characters in the book. My dilema is the movie has left out a lot of stuff. They shortened the fight and some other things. If you have not read the book do so before watching the movie so you can fully understand. This was the longest of all the books and the shortest movie. I agree with the viewer who stated these books should be a mini series so we can get the full view.
3,Harry is the BEST,"Harry Potter is definitely not just for children. I am 60 years old and an avid fan since the first book. I very much enjoyed Order of the Phoenix, but it is a shame that it was so truncated.That is why I only gave it a three star rating. It deserves a Michael Jackson director who understands that there is no stinting on the necessary parts of an epic film. Phoenix was so fast moving that if I hadn't read the book 6 times I would have been totally lost.I sincerely hope that they understand that Harry deserves more grounding before they film the last two installments."
3,unsatisfying,"This movie should be twice longer: the HP stories are novels and should be experienced as novels filmically, not as short stories. Its visual finesse seems only to add to its lack."
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,My daughter is a huge HP fan and she really likes it on Blu-Ray due to the improved image quality as well as all the additional features.
4,Great movie; not meant for kids,"The 5th movie in the Harry Potter series is again a great installment in this movie franchise. As usual, the mood is darker than the previous movie, though we do have some true romance in this one. The cast is big, as we have numerous characters from all the previous movies, with several new ones, both students and professors. Alas this is the first movie without any Quidditch scenes, though this is more than compensated by some awesome broomstick flying thru downtown London. And we finally have some extensive duels to the death between adult wizards and witches, with two of them forming the movie's climax. Overall, a great movie."
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,I bought this mainly for my 2 children who are both HP fans and they loved it!!
3,Missing 5th Movie!!!,"I purchased this disk set after christmas when it was still about $20 (now its $14; sigh). I sat down this weekend to watch #4 and #5 for the first time. #4 was amazing and I was excited to watch #5 when I had a disturbing discovery that instead of the main DVD of #5, they'd inserted only the special features DVD. Of course, I logon to amazon.com to find out how I can return the set but my ""return window"" has expired. So, now I'm stuck having to buy #5 separately.BUYER BEWARE!!! Don't make my mistake and ""assume"" they put the DVD package together correctly... you know what they say about ""assuming""... fail on both mind and Amazon's part. Check all the DVD boxes as soon as you receive them so you can return it when they've messed up the packaging."
1,DVD was damaged - scratched,"The DVD was terribly scratched when we opened it and wouldn't play. Unfortunately, it would cost me more money to actually send it back in than it would be to go to Wal-Mart to get it."
5,the order of phoenix,plays great real good condition my kids realy like harry potter thanks a lotwe have prchased used dvd s before but they never worke his god
2,DVD Quality is TERRIBLE,"On my first play of this movie I noticed how digitally crappy the image looked. I have never, ever had a DVD with so many digital artifacts throughout the entire movie.I am not referring to bad CGI during an action sequence, I am referring to inexcusably bad DVD encoding. Even with mild background movement, the details and colors become blocky, muddied, and unnatural.I do have an HDTV and a progressive scan DVD player, so with a normal setup the differences may not be noticeable, but I firmly believe the quality of this DVD encoding was intentionally reduced to enhance the benefit of owning the HD version of this movie available on Blu-ray.I work for a company that provides Digital TV over DSL using MPEG 4 compression, and if we lower the encoding quality, the results look the same as how this whole movie looks, ""just barely"" good enough."
1,New Harry Potter movie/DvD,"I was sent BlueRay when there was no mention of choice. Therefore, totally useless."
1,Why???,"I must disclose I purchased this as a gift for my wife. That said, I did watch it with her. I don't get it!!! Way too violent for young children, and way to juvenile for an adult. Just a pile of brittish crap dumped on us like most from across the pond. I do not understand the lore of a poorly written movie, with poor acting and directing, loaded with mistakes. All of the subsequent films have basically the same story line. Just an over-hyped boring film...."
1,Stick with the book.,"I do not like this film. It omitted too much story from the novel. In my opinion, books 4-7 would have made better tv miniseries films, then a lot more of the story could be captured. Best part of the film is the acting. Ignore this film and stick with the first two films and the seven books."
1,Why did they even make this movie?,"This is by far the worst harry potter film yet!!! Having read the book I was sickened by this movie. If you have read the book DON""T SEE THIS MOVIE rent it on redbox for a dollar, its all this movie is worth!!!!"
4,"Dark, secretive and down right thiller-like!","This is the darkest movie of the whole series. With this effect your sitting at the edge of your seat the entire time. Every unexpected move makes you jump. You look at the characters faces and you know they are unhappy and this is going to be more like a thriller than an action/adventure although it is that too.The only thing that I don't like is Rupert Grint. He's not that great of an actor. In this movie all he seems to do is stand in the background and look sulky. Ron isn't supposed to be that way. Oh well! I suppose I would be unhappy if they changed him!All in all, this is the best movie!! Watch it, love it, and watch it some more!"
4,"Great plot, cheesy effects","Entertaining, but what happened to the special effects? The flying scenes looked like something from a 1950's B-grade SciFi flick. The giant? 1970's video game quality. This was all about making a film fast for as little money as possible. Most of the SFX were top grade, but they really skimped on the ones that counted."
3,The Book is Better,"Unfortunately, they now have to take more shortcuts with the movies. The 1st 3 movies were very close to the books but now the series is getting much to complicated for the cinema to depict properly. They did a very good job with the movie but once again the book is better."
3,Surprises,"I think this move was ok, they left a great deal out that would have pulled the movie together better. Maybe the next one will be better."
2,The movie is the good but the DVD transfer is terrible,I thought this was a good movie. Of course it doesn't compare to the book but pretty much all book to movie adaptations are that way. What shocked me about this was the quality of the video. It's grainy and full of compression artifacts. I can't believe that Warner Brothers would release a movie like this.
5,Great disc set,"What can I really say. The movie is fantastic, and the extras are great fun too. Well worth the expense."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"Like all the Harry Potter movies it was exciting, mysterious! I would recommend this movie to all ages! GREAT MOVIE!"
4,AMAZING!!!,I'M BRAZILIAN AND THIS WAS MY FIRST BUY IN THE USA... I LIKED VERY MUCH AND THE PRODUCT IS VERY VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL... THANKS!!!
3,Too much plot,"I have close to no recollection of seeing 'The Order of the Phoenix' before, but I'm certainly glad I'd seen the first four movies so recently, or I certainly would have struggled to follow the plot. Harry is a suitably stroppy teenager, in fact really stroppy, and the whole plot seems to be fairly ""woe is me""-esque. The students sit their OWL exams and learn amazing magic under Harry's tutelage. Draco's dad asks what everyone watching must have thought: ""Did u really think that children could win?"" There is finally some real action and magic towards the end of the movie; but the dramas and emotions that the written version impart are probably replaced with a happy/feel good message. My honestest opinion is that they tried to put too much plot in thsi film and it lost some continuity. It felt rushed and over-busy."
4,Delivery No Especial,"Delivery time left a bit ot be desired, also the differenced between this product and the first movie product are dissappointing, HGowever notmuch can be done from your end... sorry about the spelling... i'm drunk"
2,Ineptitude in Insight,"This is in my opinion the worst of the Potter films so far. It was a huge mistake to have brought in a new director for this project. The whole feel and flow of the film is awkward; familiar and loved characters are reintroduced perfunctorally without any magic and warmth; and the editing feels disjointed and rushed. There is no cohesiveness to the whole story. When abridging and translating a book to a film, care must be shown to the surviving source material. Let's hope this director aquits himself well if indeed he will be helming Potter 6. Still, 4 great films out of 5 is a good track record."
4,so close and yet...,I was disappointed to say the least. I went in with such anticipation and then I felt kinda empty. When I read the book the last few chapters made me cry. The movie (SPOILERS TO FOLLOW) during the scene with the curtain and Sirius there was an extreme absence of emotion. It just goes slow motion for a few moments for drama and then nothing. Now I know that movies can never touch emotions like the book since you're separated from the character's thoughts and emotions but boy they could have tried harder. The screen from the book that sticks in my mind the best is Harry's rage and heartbreak when he gets back to the school. It wasn't there. Life goes on and Harry forgets all about it. I'm interested to see how they make up for the parts they removed from the movie that are pretty darn important in the next couple of books. We all know Radcliffe has the ability to act so why won't they let him?
4,Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix,I really like both the book & the movieI think the movie sticks very close to the actual words written in book 5I enjoy the movies very much but as with the books (I love them & have read them all) as the movies progress they do get more scary so I would advise kids under 13 watch this & all other Harry Potter movies with parental supervision.
3,Extras,"Even though I am a Harry Potter fan, I like to get the two disc special editions for the extras alone. This edition let me down. All it was were the specials from HBO that most have already seen."
4,magic series,"continuation of the Harry Potter series. In keeping with her style, Rowling keeps the kids on the edge of trouble and more danger. The growth of the children into young adults with heavy responsibilities to do what is right not what is easy remains the core of this to be classic seriesAs an adult with grand children I welcome this."
4,Harry Potter's latest,Our granddaughter is a huge Harry Potter fan and she watches them over and over and over but she actually felt this one was a little scarry.Quite a lot darker than the others. I would not show it to very young kids.
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Excellent story line but as usual much of what is in the book had to be left out. Why couldn't they do the Potter books as they did Lord of the Rings... So much story, divide each book into two movies. I really was hoping for even more extras on the second DVD. With all this said, I must still say that this was a great movie with great effects."
2,Harry Potter movies losing their magic,"Compared to the other Harry Potter movies, this one was a disappointment. Characters were flat and the magic seemed contrived."
5,Edition fabuleuse HELAS pas en France,"Bonjour à tous de la France, etant un grand fan d'Harry Potter je voudrais savoir si la version Son VF est bien Franaise pure ou version Canadienne ( quebecoise ). Merci d'avance pour vos réponses car je souhaiterai les acquerir tous ( les Ultimates ). Si c'est bien la version de chez nous, je vais rapidement passer commande tellement l'édition est belle.En plus il y a la VO DTS HD MA ! SUPER."
4,My least favorite HP movie,"As a huge HP fan, this movie was my least favorite. The book was far more superior to this. This was still a good movie though"
5,very pleased,The dvd was as advertised and it was sent promptly. I would certainly buy from this seller again
4,a suprisingly good movie,"""Harry Potter snd the Order of the Phoenix"" is a suprisingly good movie. I enjoyed it, very much. This director managed to zero in on the important stuff and present it concisely and well.Of course, it does help if you have read the book. But, this movie is nearly of stand-alone quality.I recommend this movie. However, the ending has some darkness in it. So, perhaps those under 15 should not be allowed to see the movie until parents can judge the level of darkness for themselves."
4,Not quite the book,Like the widescreen but still not the same as the book. Still one of my most favorite movies series of all time. Cant wait for more.
1,Digital Copy Expires on 12/31/08 - Don't pay extra for this Special Edition Feature!,"Great Movie - Special Edition does not live up to promises on packaging. I paid $7 extra for the Special Edition over regular DVD primarily to get a digital copy for my computer. But after you open the DVD packaging (rendering it non-returnable), there is an insert stating the Digital Copy expired 12/31/08 (6 months ago!!!). You get an electronic message stating the same and there is no way to get the digital copy (no help or contact info for customer service). Amazon should put this disclaimer on their advertising as this is the second time (same thing occurred on my purchase of ""Get Smart"" DVD) I've been burnt."
3,Too much lost on the cutting room floor,"I hope eventually a directors cut or extended cut will be released on DVD. There were several disconnects or discontinuities in the story. The biggest being where Umbrige catches Harry, Hermione, and Ron in her office. Then the office is full of Neville, Luna,and Ginny. They must have just happened buy? The whole scene leading up to this was obviously cut out. My son (13) and daughter (12) even caught that one. Several other places the story only makes sense if you read the book. My kids biggest comment on the movie was that many things did not make sense, too hard to follow, too many missing parts. This was my favorite of the first 6 books. Looks like 2 of the 5 stars of the movie is laying on the cutting room floor. It's one thing to have a movie that is too long and another to have one that does not follow due to omissions."
2,Missing scenes changes movie,"My widescreen edition of The Deathly Hallows Part 1 has the deleted scenes available to watch. I was shocked the first two scenes were cut (Harry with Aunt and Harry's good by to cousin shaking hands). They totally changed what happened at the beginning, omitting some of the most human reflections in the whole movie. Can you imagine watching the famous movie ""Gone with the Wind"" today with the final cuts they would make? Yeah, the story is the movie and the action was only to reflect the times the characters were living through. I really believe Chris Columbus would have forced the inclusion of the missing scenes if he had been directing."
3,Not an Ultimate Edition,"I bought this pretty much just to complete the set. No new material of the actual film added. There will probably be another ""Ultimate Edition"" at a later date with all added scenes."
3,"Oh, no, not AGAIN!","And so it continues, the least Ultimate edition in existence with no extended cuts. I do agree with another reviewer that it looks like WB is aiming to release the Ultimate Ultimate Edition with all the films boxed and (possibly) with extended cuts. The only reason why I am going to by this set is because I haven't bought any DVDs before, waiting for the BluRays to come. If WB does indeed release extended cut versions, I am not going to re-buy those - having already paid for this Ultimate edition, I will see no other option than to resort to file sharing services.So, my rating is5 stars for the film1 star for WB's release--3 stars over all."
2,Made Better with Rifftrax,"Do you love DRM? If the answer is yes, I recommend downloading from the always respectable Amazon.com. I wanted to republish this film for my own use (my own fair use), but was restricted by good ol' drm that amazon seems to love so much. Thanks Amazon.com! By not illegally downloading HP5, I avoided being able to use the work as I pleased. I should be thankful that I now have 2.78 gigs of space being used on my computer that will never be used for anything other than sitting in my computer chair instead of my more comfortable couch (like I could if I ILLEGALLY DOWNLOADED the movie instead). It was a real eye opener. Good work Amazon.com. I now am confident I will make the right choice in buying movies from now on!"
1,DVD: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"We enjoyed the DVD until it stopped playing because it was ""layered???"" We called SunCoast. They said the DVD must be defective because it should have gone right to the next layer. We just ordered another copy--not widescreen. Hope it works...."
2,I Don't Get It,"I'm an old adult male which may be the reason why I don't get this movie nor the previous ones. I love action movies with plots, but I totally miss the plot in the HP series and the action is a bit weak. The visual effects are good but barely enough to keep me awake. ""Transformers"" kept me awake."
2,Would Peter Jackson PLEASE take over filming??!!,"Oh my God. This movie was so poorly done! We are VERY disappointed with the whole plot. I keep on saying even before OOTP to make it in two or 3 parts. I know the kids are growing up fast. But they still can carry their roles. This movie, along with the other movies (except Stone and Chamber) should have been made in two to three parts, that span the course of the year. This way, your audience will appreciate the book all the more. Our parents, one who reads the books, the other just goes to see the films were both very troubled by the way Cho and Harry's relationship was non-existant. Where's Dobby and SPEW? How about Sirus's psycho-mom-from-hell screeching from the painting? How about the fact Ron and Hermonine are Prefects now? Hello, Peter Jackson? Can you please sign up to do the next two movies for us? You have the power to make it happen!"
4,"Much better than GOF and POA, but not as good as SS and COS..","First off, the Blu-Ray quality on this BDVD is great. The 1080p resolution and sound quality were well worth the price. Although I wish there was less cut out of this movie vs. the book, it was definitely much better than the GOF movie directed by Michael Newell. Overall, they touched on most of the important points of the book, and the movie flowed generally well. The BDVD extras are pretty good too, although I was hoping for a little more ""added scenes"" from the movie. One thing I will say, someone needs to remove Michael Gambon from the role of Dumbledore, as he is quite possibly one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Too bad Richard Harris had to die, he definitely played a much better Dumbledore. From what I have read, Michael Gambon has never even read the books, and believe me, it shows in his pathetic portrayal of Dumbledore."
3,Wait for the DIRECTORS CUT,"I was very disappointed with the number of scenes that were deleted; if it wasn't bad enough, Yates hacked up the film based on the book by eliminating key scenes. Lord of the rings is a 2 disk DVD per Movie....why couldn't they do that with this one?Very disappointing...for now, I'll stick to the books."
2,Another disappointment,"This movie felt like each scene was a preview for what the scene should have been. Like a 90 second sample of a scene that should have been ten minutes. Why was the longest book the shortest movies when the most common complaint of HP fans is missing or deleted scenes? If you didnt read the book you wont know whats going on. If you read the book you'll wonder what the hell were they thinking.The acting was flat and lacking emotion. Many key parts and and characters were missing those that were new and present had one or two lines. The actress playing Luna Lovegood did a good job as did Helen Bonham Carter but they had tiny tiny parts. Again, could have been great but ended up a disappointment."
2,New Director Please,This movie could have been done much better by Chris Columbus. (The director of the first two movies). The meaning and feelings in the book are stripped out of the movie and those who do not read the book are missing out on the magic of the series.
1,Received preview DVD but not the MOVIE DVD. Still waiting for that.,The instructions on the preview were followed with no results. What does one have to do to obtain the paid for DVD?
1,Lost in mail...,Product was lost in mail. I had trouble finding information regarding the status of my purchase. Amazon is sending a replacement free of charge.
3,reasonable,Product arrived in the order it was expected and in the condition promised. Shipping and handling fees were high.
3,Quite fair,"Its an awesome movie, getting darker by the minute..you will completely love it. The wise screen version is fantastic"
1,HP and the Order of the Pheonix. (Widescreen),Not sure of the authenticity??? DVD has different look than the store commercial product and operates poorly....:~(It seems odd. Never bought another DVD that just didn't seem right like this one
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,We enjoyed the movie. Always disappointed that so much of the story has been left out to accomodate the length of the film
5,Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix,The DVD is great and we enjoyed the movie. The director did a good job of editing the book for the film but I wished there was a little more about the Black's house elf. Great movie!
5,Fantasy Love,"Love all the Potter movies....the special effects, story lines, the actors themselves do a fine job...all have held my interest...."
3,Ho Hum,"I've watched all the Harry Potter movies, and I think this one is the worst. I haven't read any of the books, but I hope it's because the movie producers are getting tired. Same story, Harry and crew run around trying to figure out where the bad guy is. They get in trouble, they get out of trouble and they beat the bad guy. Next movie I am renting first."
5,Amazing Adventure,The best Harry Potter so far. The special effects are incrediable. And the extras are cool.
5,Good disc,Very good movie and disc setup. The extras were okay but nothing really special.Worthy addition tot he collection.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful as Bella Lestrange, but this movie adaptation of one of the richest (and best) books in the series feels condensed to the point of lunacy; the book's spectacular (and very cinematic) concluding chase through the ministry is almost entirely cut, whole months of the book seem to have been excluded, and I have no idea how someone unfamilar with the novel would keep up--why make the longest book into the shortest film?"
5,very happy,well they said it was ok but it like brand new not one scrach on it and it came very fast way before the estimated shipping date and it was very cheap very happy
5,Great movie for sure!,"If you like Harry Potter, this is a must see! you will enjoy every moment of it!"
5,I Love It,"it is truly and ultimate edition.ultimate material, ultimate packinghighly recommended for any Harry Potter Fan!!!only the Digital Copy itunes code doesn't work at all"
5,Great movie,"I love all the Harry Potter movies and this one is no exeption. A bit darker than the previous ones and of course there are always things that are left out from the book, but definitely a must-have for your collection."
2,"I am SO hugely disappointed,","This film was such a HUGE disappointment to me, and I am not the kind of person who typically criticizes films. For those who have read this book (which is phenominal, by the way!), this movie is missing absolutely everything. And for those who haven't read the book, this movie is completely and utterly confusing. There is no character development whatsoever, not even with Ron & Hermione. I think Luna and Neville had more lines than 80% of the key characters. This movie is missing everything important, yet it is so jumbled and has so much crammed into it that your brain is spinning. I don't get it. It was such a mess. I really hope the last two movies will at least somewhat live up to the amazing books!!"
2,Not DVD quality,"This is a review of the actual product quality and not the movie itself. Basically, it seems like they did a shoddy job of encoding it for DVD. One wonders if it was purposefully done to encourage people to buy Blu-Ray discs. On my HD TV, the video quality is pretty pixelated and shadow areas have too much noise in them. I have other DVDs that look much, MUCH better on my TV because the information on the actual DVD's is of much higher quality. If you wondered why the price is this cheap, you now know. That said, the actual movie is wonderful and a joy to watch!"
2,highly disappointing adaptation,"""Order of the Phoenix"", as a novel, is mostly about character development. This is the novel where Harry and his friends truly begin to grow up. For this reason, the cut the movie producers decided upon hurt, mostly because they made many poor decisions in what to cut. Cuts are necessary, but must be done intelligently. However, the cuts are not the fatal flaw of the film. No, that's the climatic battle with the Deatheaters. Here is where we are supposed to truly glimpse the mortal danger Harry and his friends are in. Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Watching it, I came away with an overwhelming sense the Deatheaters were going easy on the kids, because they were kids. You never feel they are actually in any real danger. Completely kills the movie. Overall, I've liked the film adaptations. This one was botched though. Read the book, avoid the film."
3,The Order of the Phoenix,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an incredible film. For all those who think this film's storyline is weak or boring...wow. This film's got to be the most realistic out of the five. The bonus features in the Special Edition are what one would expect from a single disc release...The Digital Download is not for iPods, and it cannot be converted into iPod format. Overall, the best thing of the DVD is the film itself. Hopefully the next Harry Potter DVD will be packed with loads more extras...like the first 3 films."
5,The Order Of The Phoenix Harry Potter,Great Movie. Superbe Action. Nice Story about the Harry Potter Saga. On Blu Ray the image is better and the sound the same.
4,"Not the best of the series, but its a must.","You see when Harry begins to fold from all the pressure. Hermione gets easy on the eyes, and that Substitute minister is a kook."
3,DISC TWO WAS DISAPPOINTING,"Compared to the other movies, the second disc was disappointing. The additional scenes were OK, but Trailing Tonks didn't spend enough time in any of the set areas. I think five areas covered in the same amount of time would have been better. The canteen part could have been left out completely. The 'Hidden Secrets' may be interesting to a casual fan but not someone like me who had read the books and seen the movies multiple times. The 'Editing' part was not good at all if you are over 10 years old."
2,HP Order of the Phoenix ultimate edition,"I have the 1-4 ultimate editions and in the Special Features disc there were interactive games and puzzles. Not in 5 and 6! What you get is an advertisement urging you to buy a disc with interactive games at your nearest DVD store. $40 bucks for the movie and ""Creating the World"" episode that I can watch on cable. The greed never ends."
3,A lot left out...,"For those of you who've read the book, you will feel cheated. The movie leaves many clarifying details out. It also changes key aspects of the story. That being said, the movie is entertaining and the special effects are very well done. Still, I would have liked to have seen it follow the book a bit closer."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,The carrying of backpacks to school and the eating of cereal in the Great Hall indicate exactly what sort of movie this is. Thoroughly disgusting and unforgivable.
3,Mixed Review of the 5 movies overall,"I have to say that I LOVE the Harry Potter books!! That said, I also enjoy the movies. I prefer the books to the movies and have found that it's best NOT to review the books before watching the movies. I actually try to see the movies with little or no expectations, except they stay true to the book (for me, DO NOT ADD TO THE BOOKS!) I realize that you have to ""abridge"" the movies for time and effects (there are still a few things they just can't do in the movie that an author can create in the imagination). Another thing you have to realize when watching these movies is that everyone will imagine things at least slightly differently. I do, however, agree with the reviewer that said they need to bring back the original director (from the first two movies); the movies seemed to be of better quality overall."
5,Harry Potter Movie,"I ordered at the last minute, but recieved the order in time for Christmas. Thank you."
4,Harry Potter and the Flight of the Pheonix,"Very entertaining, in the tradition of the series of the Harry Potter films. I hope we have more to come."
3,Not as good as the others...,"I thought that this movie was just okay. I really love all of the Harry Potter books, and all of the movies. The Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite book, and the movie didn't have my favorite parts of the book. (of which there were very few) This made the movie very bland and dull. During the middle, it really dragged. Although I liked both the beginning and the end (except for the part where Sirius died) the middle part was just too slow. I am hoping that movie 6 will be much better."
3,Case is broken when the shipment arrived,"I bought this DVD as part of my collection. Shipment was fast, however, the DVD case was broken (like something heavy was put on top of it, one side is really crashed). Good thing the DVD itself is in good condition."
3,The 4th Movie,"Having read the Harry Potter books, the movie just doesn't quite make the grade. It leaves out some of the very important parts of the book and the story is difficult to follow in places. The acting is the usual standard for the previou Potter movies. But I felt like I didn't get the whole story with the movie. The previous 3 movies were much better."
2,"Slow, V ... e...r...y ... S...l...o...w","I really enjoyed the first a previous book by the same author. I thought that if I just pushed through I would, in the end, enjoy this one as well. At 52% I decided it just wasn't worth it. I may come back and finish it at some point, but not now.THE BOTTOM LINE:I would recommend Mr Midshipman Easy if you're looking for a free kindle book from the same time period."
3,"Hard to Read, Hard to Navigate","Well, I love Whitman and I love free books. So that being said, I can't really complain too much. However, I was very disappointed by the lack of formatting and navigation options. The line breaks are practically non-existent, with the exception of punctuation that serves as line breaks (colons and so forth). Furthermore, the table of contents is not linked/click-able. You can't use it to navigate from poem to poem. You will have to use the search function and bookmarks extensively to make your version comfortable to navigate. The collection itself is rather extensive, which is nice."
4,Arranged a little oddly,Nice collection but it's arranged a little oddly. Some pieces I would put under different categories. Makes my favorite poem hard to find.
2,Eh.,"Yes, some of Mr. Whitman's are contained in the e-book. Without an index, good luck on finding a particular one. Or even being able to tell where one ends and another starts. Al least it was free. Although, I think I would have rather paid for it to get an index."
3,Tundra 2000 - double check the pin count,"I ordered this for my 2000 Toyota Tundra, only to find out that in 2000 they put two different stock stereos in, one with 20 pins(the one I have) and one with 10 pins(the one I ordered). SO be sure to double check before ordering"
5,Great Quality!,I use Kant Clamps when doing precision grinding because they are small for their clamping force. This is a good quality tool.
4,A man of two worlds....,"In this book, Martiniano, the main character, struggles to achieve a homeostasis amongst confining to the laws of the whites while still keeping the values, norms, and beliefs of his older Native American culture. There are a few sublots involving a religious sight that all come together to make a compelling conclusion to a beautifully written novel. The imagery involved within the piece make The MAn Who Killed The Deer a defined and rather extraordinary novel. It is a timeless claassic which should be read and enjoyed by all who still care about making themselves better persons."
2,"Don't confuse this one with the ""giallo"" original","No, this is not the sleazy-awful-fun Carroll Baker 'Giallo' thriller from Italy with the same title (in Italy the title was ""Orgasmo"") released in 1968 that had a rich widow captive in her own mansion to her sexually menancing gardener and his bisexual girlfriend, listening to groovy Piero Umilani music while they wrapped her up in mind-and-sex games. I guess if you've completely run out of grade B thrillers to watch, this 1998 release rates OK. Decent technical, but the storyline is tired, and it has been done better."
1,"Not Scary, Not Original, & Not Worth Your Time...","This film looks like an old slasher film from the 80s, but really it is lowbudget horror flick made only 2 years ago. A stalker terrorizes a poor, innocent victim, but the poor, innocent victim decides to get him back for killing her family. This is an okay storyline, you might be saying, but it is executed so poorly it isn't even close to scary (or interesting for that matter). Save yourself some time and do not view this movie."
2,Leaves a stubborn film on cups,"I liked the taste and effervescence. However, Airborn left a film on all my cups that my dishwasher could not remove. I had to hand wash all my cups after using this. I've had Krueger Vitamin C- Effervescent Tablets which had better effervescence and didn't leave a film on my cups."
1,Over priced,This seems to be overpriced vitamin C supplement.The package bought here is a little bigger than the one you got at the store. However it's not worth the $$ at all.
5,Perfect for soups and stews,"We had a similar ladle for about twenty years, and it seved us very well until the handle snapped after thousands of trips through the dishwasher. Alas, when I tried to order another of the same model, it was no longer available. I bought the Rosti ladle mainly for the color (which is even more intense than the picture!) but was pleasantly surprised by both the quality and the shape of this ladle. I has a nice heft and balance (not flimsy, like most of the plastic ladles sold today) and the bowl of the ladle is somewhat flattened on the lip opposite the handle, making it ideal for getting the last of the stew or soup off the bottom of the pot, while the sides of the bowl have a tighter radius, which allows getting into the edges of the bottom of the pot. After more than a year of regular use, it still looks as good as new, and I'm very satisfied with it. Plus, it comes in a wide variety of colors, to boot!"
4,Nice Try,"I didn't read ""Individually Wrapped"" yet, but his second collection ""Nice Try"" was a Christmas present worth re-reading. The author is a midwestern Dave Barry with views on food, marriage, and technology that are enjoyable reading."
2,Poor Craftsmanship,"Unlike in the photo, the ring doesn't have the design completely around the ring. There is about a two or three millimetre section that is solid silver. Also, some of the strands of silver look broken instead of woven under another strand like in the product picture. I would keep in mind that since the ring isn't a solid band, it may bend easily."
1,What a travesty. This putative guru peddling his self-avowed enlightenment is a charlatan at best.,"Skeptical? Simply research him as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. He and his 'disciples' descended on Oregon, USA in the '80s, established a commune, where he had a fleet of Bentleys, jeeps armed military hardware patrolling the vast property, poisoned (or attempted) the water, etc.--research their legal entanglements and ultimate fleeing out of the USA by him and his key accomplice, Sheila. He is no more enlightened than or evolved than Hitler was...bent on power and material gain at the expense of believers. If you are going to invest your time, and esp., your hope and trust in a spiritual guide, seek someone more enlightened than yourself (one who helps you realize you ultimately possess the answers better than they. Good luck and my best to any who read this."
1,that touch of mink,Wrong movie sent and hasn't been replaced with correct one yet...very bad coustomer service..movie will not play on my dvd....wrong format
2,"Great movie,poor quality","I love Doris Day and this movie is funny,entertaining and fun to watch. The only disappointment here is the dvd. The sound is mono and the quality is not the best, could have been better. That's why a give it a 2 for quality. I hope they give this movie a better treatment. I've seen older movies look and sound better than this. Great cover though. Now I wish they would give this movie that touch of mink."
1,Good Movie - Horrible Recording,"Artisan has released a horrible recording of a very good, sophisticated comedy that questions the values of marriage. The DVD I got from the start had poor sound quality, faded color and was actually out of focus. To add to this this disc started skipping, freezing and even getting the vocals out of sequence with the picture. Don't waste your money on this release. Wait for a better release."
1,Poor recording,"I bought the Artisan version. Half way through it started blurring, skipping, and stopped. Multiple attempts to get it to run failed."
4,VHS MOVIE: That Touch of Mink,I purchased this movie to give as a gift. I would have prefered a DVD vs a VHS though. I have not watched this movie.
5,That touch of Mink,If only romance comedies were still this way. Cary Grant and Doris Day are great. Also Gig Young gives this comedy some of the best scenes.
4,Doris and Cary,"I like this movie. It isn't my favorite Doris Day movie, nor my favorite Cary Grant movie, but it still has it's moments. The fashion scenes with Doris are great. My favorite scenes occur in the automat, where Doris's roommate works. I also love the scene where Gig Young is talking to his homely secretary and looks her over and decides she might be beautiful under her glasses and pinned up hair, so he takes off her glasses and lets down her hair and... well, you'll just have to see the movie! Another great movie to stay at home and watch on a cold night!"
4,Nice Comedy,"Pleasant and harmless comedy which has some very funny moments indeed, about an unemployed small town girl in New York (Doris Day), who accidentally meets millionaire man-of-the-world (Cary Grant) and falls in love with him.This film belongs to that kind of late `50s and early `60s glamorous chic fluff that was being made at Universal Studios at that time, with the aforementioned Day, Rock Hudson, James Garner, Tony Randall, et al.Gig Young and Audrey Meadows give fine support as friends of the starring couple. John Astin (future Gomez Addams of the well-remembered 1960s TV series ""Addams Family"") is very funny as an extremely unpleasant character who's after Doris Day, and Richard ""Dick"" Sargent (later to be ""Bewitched's"" second Darrin Stephens) has a nice bit as a honeymooner in Bermuda."
3,Classic Cary Grant/Doris Day Combo Good Not Great,"Cary Grant and Doris Day made some great movies together. I can't get enough of Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back. That Touch of Mink falls a little short of that mark. While it's as charming, it's just not as funny. I own several of the movies the two did together, and I find that I don't watch That Touch of Mink as much as I thought I would. If you're a fan of classic comedies, this is nice one to add to your collection. Just don't start your collection with it."
1,Love Cary Grant. Love Doris Day. Hate This Movie.,"A major failure from some incredible talent in front of and behind the camera. Who came up with this ridiculous story for such a great team as Cary Grant and Doris Day? It is a terrible waste of two screen greats and a totally worthless experience. If you like the typical comedies from either of these stars, you will probably not like this movie. For each it's one of their worst--and Cary Grant looks like he is just walking through his role with no emotion."
3,Weird Movie,"This movie was made in 1962, but the whole style is basically 50s, Doris Day looks like my grandmother in it. The whole plot is kind of weird, watch it yourself, but don't expect anything great really. Just some sugarcoated 50s Hollywood romance with two aging protagonists and 1950s sexual mores. Basically the rich guy (Cary Grant, who else) meeting the country wench kind of thing. For a better movie with Grant I would recommend ""House Boat"", Sophia Loren is much better than Doris Day anyhow."
1,That Touch of Turkey,"One of Cary Grant's worst vehicles, ""That Touch of Mink"" (1962) finds the inimitable screen legend going through the motions in a tiresome ""romantic comedy."" Precious little chemistry between Cary and Doris Day, with a good supporting cast doing its best to prop up the contrived hijinks. Both stars are too old for this nonsense.OVERALL RATING: *"
4,Ok fun Doris Day & Cary Grant film-Poor video quality,"I don't know if this is characteristic of all prints of this film, but mine has many moments of losing focus. It's very annoying, especially if you have good eyesight! Anyone else notice this or is this limited to certain batches? I bought mine on Amazon."
1,Miracle Grow should be ashamed,"The Miracle Grow Liquifieed Starter Kit is a disgrace for the Miracle Grow brand. It is top heavy, poorly constructed, has a cheap plastic connector that strips immediately. I was incensed with the design and the way it worked. I feel like the brand I have trusted for years has let me down. They won't fool me again. I cant wait to tell my friends about this so that they will avoid the frustation."
2,technical difficulties,Like many of the other reviewers I have encountered problems with the device in terms of it actually being able to suck the fertilizer liquid into the water stream. I will say that it seemed to work fine for several months. Then I began encountering intermittent difficulties. And now after 6 months or so doesn't seem to work at all. Seems to make more sense to throw down the granules instead.
1,"""Feeder Quality is non-existent""","This is a sorry excuse for product to be sold to the public. It is even more disturbing that reponsible vendors sell this product. Home Depot and Lowe's lead the pack. The design is okay but the materials used and construction is deficient. ""Gardener in Austin, Texas."
1,Cannot Keep it Working!!,"I have tried the Liquafeed Miracle Gro product several times. Each time, the product stops working. It's supposed to empty in fifteen minutes but I have several bottles that do NOT do what they were supposed to do. I am tired of calling up Miracle Gro and having them send me coupons for design flawed products. If only EVERY bottle would emit the feeder like they are supposed to do!"
2,Tired of trying,"The first time we used the Miracle grow liquid feeder it worked fine. Two months later it started to work fine, I could see bubbles coming up in the container then it stopped. I tried a different bottle and bubbles once again so I knew it was working, then it stopped about 1/2 bottle down. I am a DIY guy and took it apart.Checked the tiny screen and it was OK. Checked the pin that goes into the bottle and it was OK but, still would not work with new bottle. Going to return about 6 bottles if we can. It is a great idea if it would only work."
1,Is it working?,I bought the liquafeed system expecting it to be easy to use. I don't know if there is any fertilizer coming out of the bottle. I've tried to reposition the nozzle and have unscrewed and replaced the bottle several times but there doesn't seem to be any less product in the bottle. I guess I'll try it for a while to see if the plants respond.
4,"pretty good, pretty neat..","looks zacally like the picture. it's a good size. wish it was blacklight reactive though, or somehow lit up. other than that it's awesome."
2,Out-dated,"This book gives prices in FF (French Francs). France changed from Francs to Euros in 2000. Does that give you a hint of how out-dated this book is? Granted, a lot of the information will still be valid, but much will not; needs another edition with a serious update. Also, could use lots of photos or drawings to illustrate the points she's making (for examples, Price discusses various types of French pottery; it would be nice to see what she's talking about)This is probably a better book for armchair travel than for actually guiding you through French flea markets. Good luck!"
2,Bad from the start,"I purchased the Delta 22-560 as my first portable planer in February of 2001. Prior to the end of the first year of use (casual wood worker) I had to take it in and have the cutter head assembly replaced. When I received it back from the Porter Cable/Delta repair shop, it sounded twice as loud as it did before I took it in. Today, as I was planing 2"" red oak, I began to smell rubber burning and the unit quit cutting. (At least it did not spray the parts through-out the shop as one other user described.) Disassembling it, I determined that the cutter head assembly nut had come loose and could not be tightened without the pulley on the cutter head ""throwing"" the belt off because of a wobble in the pulley. I will not buy another Delta planer (even though I have been a Porter Cable/Delta purchaser for years) and am considering either a Makita or the Grizzly 15 inch."
3,Lemon anybody?,"I have always been a big supporter of Delta tools, However, I'm afraid I cannot give this product great praise. The fact is, the only reason I am giving them 3 stars at all is for the overall end product it can produce. Now I've used four different brands of planers and never encountered the types of problems I've had with this peice of equipment! Easily enough broken down, but jeeze I've had to take this thing apart 4 times this months... I've only used it 5 times this month! with moderate 1/16th cuts. Today the belt shredded to peices for the second time in 5 months. I'm about to find a Jet 15"" planer online, The more expensive machine will pay for it self compared to all the time I lose trying to fix the delta!Hope this machine was just a lemon, but prehaps this will help someone else."
1,this won't be the last planer you own,"I purchased the delta 22-560 portable planer in 2001. It has served me well for most of the time until about 2005 when wood chips were forced under on knife bending it and the locking bar. I was unable to remove the locking bar screws without striping the hex head of several screws. This completely ruined the locking bar because it was bent and must be perfectly flat in order to work at all. I ordered new screws and locking bar. I tried to use standard button head cap screws as a replacement, but the heads are too tall. You have to purchase the screws from delta. The were about $2.00 each plus shipping. I remember thinking it was pretty expensive. I think the locking bar was about $40. Today, Dec. 2009 it happened again. I would not recommend this planer to a friend.I am now looking at reviews to before I purchase my next planer. I am not a professional wood worker, but I expect tools to work without destroying themselves."
2,"O.K. if you really like devotionals, BUT...","Maybe this review is a bit tainted because I don't really care for devotionals that much. The reason is because much of the context is lost when one verse is ""pulled out of the hat.""I found some of the stories to be a forced link to the verse it was to be depicting (lack of context). I also found that much of the stories were worldly wisdom. For instance, in one case I'm almost certain that ""the end justifies the means"" was being presented, and I find no such notion in the Bible.Of course there were some good stories also, but overall, I just don't care for reading that doesn't explain the setting and identifies the context."
2,Nothing particularly extraordinary or helpful,"While this book does have a decent number of code samples (though it could certainly use both more samples and more detailed samples), the book seems to just be a rehash of the well-known OpenGL red book (OpenGL Programming Guide). I've been reading them simultaneously, and I've yet to find anything of use in Angel's book that is not in the red book. So, do yourself a favor and don't waste the time/money reading this book--your time would be better spent delving further into the code samples and online resources associated with the OpenGL Programming Guide."
2,not especially helpful,"Has too much of a pedantic and formal tone to be helpful to someone who really wants to dig in and write code. OpenGL has gone through a lot of growth, and I was hoping to find something that would zero in on modern OpenGL. This book did not meet that need. You'll still need the OpenGL Red Book, and this primer will not make it any easier to do that, nor will it tell you which parts of the Red Book can be safely ignored. I'd like to see more practical programming advice and less of a formal treatment of the theory."
2,Bring out the GLUT. The GLUT's sleepin.....,"Then I guess you better wake him up! That's right, I hope you like using the GLUT (Graphics Library Utility Toolkit) because that's all Angel uses here. Sure, the GLUT is great if you just want to display a spinning triangle or create the most basic program, but if you want to create an OpenGL project with some bite then you should pick up another book which will teach you Qt or Windows programming. If you're a n00b, opengl will render all of your shapes and colors, but it can't create its own window to run in. The GLUT is one way to create an ""opengl window,"" but the GLUT is by all means the most basic and useless of the possible methods. Yes, I realize this is a ""primer,"" but for 30+ dollars, you can do better. Much, much better. Besides nothing in this book isn't something you couldn't find in a pdf file on opengl.org."
2,"Retractable cord is a great feature, but iron leaks water constantly!","I bought this iron after seeing all the positive reviews and since it was included on a recent Amazon 4-for-3 sale. I wish I'd looked at similar Proctor-Silex iron reviews such as theEasy Press Retractable Cord Lightweight Ironbecause this iron definitely has the same major problem...it leaks water all over your clothes! Any time you have water in the reservoir and bring the iron from upright to horizontal to iron, a fair amount of the water just drips right on the clothes. Not sure if this is a specific defect with the iron I got and others haven't noticed it, but it is very obvious on my model, and the other reviews mentioning it on the similar model would indicate a design flaw. It's a shame, as I love the retractable cord option, but I need an iron that also works properly, and this one simply does not."
2,Let's Go and Lot's of Filler! I Want My Money Back!,"After the very impressive ""Points on the Curve"" and then the hit single ""Let's Go"" I thought I'd get the follow up cd. One of the worst cd-purchase decisions of my life! Either the guys just didn't care or just wanted to fulfil the album quota on their recording contracts because the cd is so short with just 8 tracks and compared with the first album is just very poor. If you want to be kind maybe you could say there are 2 good tracks and the rest are just fillers.How bad is it? I recently tried selling both cds at a used cd shop and they only took the first one and rejected this one eventhough the first one was scratched and in much worse condition than this one. Speaks volumes to me. Now, I'm just waiting for a remastered version of ""Points on the Curve"" to come out. I prefer to remember Wang Chung based on their first album and hope to forget they ever did ""Mosaic."""
2,Not a good album.,"This album is terrible. I bought it for $0.01, and I still can't decide if it was worth it or not. Don't buy this album if you like underground hip-hop. If you like Nelly, Ja Rule, or Mase, you will probably like this album. I will admit that there are a couple of flows that made me laugh when I first heard them, but the production is so lame and monotonous that its not worth the listening time."
5,Uplifting popular jazz vocals,"I was mesmerized by this CD when I heard it playing in a music store in Florence, Italy. The fantastic part is a year later in my own home, the music of Vanoni still thrills me and all guests. Everyone asks, ""who is that! ""."
5,Great Dutch grammar,"That's a very good grammar. I'm a Portuguese native speaker and it is very difficult to a Latin language speaker to learn a Germanic language, but this grammar made it easier. It even helped me with the German language. This one is great for beginners, everyone should buy it. With this book I was glad twice: I started to study an interesting language (Dutch) and I began to understand a very difficult language (German). Buy it, you won't be disappointed. It gives you a comprehensive explanation about all points of the Dutch language."
3,Strictly Pedagogical,"The following review refers to the first edition:This grammar is directed primarily at the intermediate student of the language, and in serving that audience, fails on two counts to earn the descriptor 'comprehensive'. In the first place, it assumes, especially with regard to phonology and graphology, that the reader is already substantially versed in the Dutch standard, and provides description only of points troublesome to a reader with such knowledge. It also fails to provide full treatment of forms deemed unusual or archaic, believing them to fall outside the range of interest of its intended audience, which demands a rough-and-ready practical description of contemporary Dutch usage. It is that which this grammar provides, not comprehensive description of the Dutch language."
5,An outstanding movie for aestethicians,"I disagree completely with Martin's review that Ludwig is a character so cold that no one feels any symathy for. But I do think that you have to have prerequisites to see this movie otherwise you won't appreciate it: you must be a Wagner's fan and generally you have to love art, you need to know the Tannhauser and Tristan und Isolde operas, you need to know a story of Richard Wagner and Cosima von Bulow; you need to know something about Austrian Empress Elisabeth, and you better have visited Ludwig's castels in Bavaria and also the city of Munich. Ludwig was an unusual man, and it would be inappropriate to judge him by ordinary standards. A great Visconti film, and if you like Death in Venice, you shoudl try this one, too."
1,Worst film I ever saw,"This is one of the worst films I ever saw. So much posing and posturing. Excruciating analysis of the characters' emotional mindframes and moods. Excruciating, period. I thought one would see something about the building of the castles. Not at all. The fact that it is in Italian loses all credibility for this film, and the focus on Ludwig's moodiness is agonizing. So many unconnected bits and pieces are tossed about. There is no real action in the film, i.e. give and take conversation between the characters. It's all moody Ludwig. It's awful, and I can't wait to get rid of it. If you think you are going to see something that shows a flattering picture of the king, you are mistaken. He is made to look like an ogre. The script is particularly awful."
1,Ludwig II,"This movie does not even deserve one star. It was the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. The lighting, the cinematography, and direction was terrible. I bought this set after seeing the Sissi trilogy with Romy Schneider on DVD, on a code free DVD player in the original, which was beautiful. This Ludwig II should be totally trashed and redone properly, with proper lighting, showing the beauty of the scenery properly and without the explanations in between scenes. This is the first time I bought a movie from Amazon.com and the company that distributes and produces this movie - NEVER AGAIN."
4,Howard Zinn's quest,"Anyone interested in history, academically or otherwise, should read Zinn's work since history is written by the winners, the best fighters, the most arrogant, sonmetimes, the most patient. It would be wisefor history teachers to present ""the other side"". I highly recommend his work."
1,Do NOT order this - it is not the NDS.,"I was dumb - now you don't have to be...This is not an HTML version of the NDS - it is an announcement saying that it is now available.If you're a cheapskate like me, this is NOT going to help you."
4,Not long enough,A previous review led me to believe that these yoga pants would be longer than usual. I went by this review since the product details do not list the inseam length. I have long legs so I was excited to read another customer's comment that these pants are longer than usual. They are not. They have a 32 inch inseam which is too short for me. Too bad for me because they are really cute and comfortable. I will have to send them back.
2,Badly needs updating & poorly executed,"This book is old (1991) and does not cover the importantfacet of sector rotation or how to intrepret this book into a meaningful stock play. Murphy in this book does not even hint at it, thus allot of this information is not truly useful. The concept is superb but the execution quite flawed.Instead get the other Murphy book:Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications OR Martin Pring's new edition to his updated Complete Technical Analysis. Even Murphy's chapter in New Thinking in Technical Analysis: Trading Models from the Masterswas better than this book, despite its short 25 page conciseness.Funnily his video on this topic DOES update the book and cover Sector Rotation so Murphy obviously is aware of the oversight.This book is boring with no payoff. There is too much repitition with no real payoff (sector rotation); if you are truly interested in this important field of study look elsewhere."
5,THIS BOOK WILL EXPLAIN YOU HOW MARKETS REALLY WORK,"This is the best book you can find in advanced technical analisys. Together with John's book ""Technical analisys of futures markets"" and the Schwager on Futures series is a ""must"" for whoever wants to start in Futures Trading. This book is so logical that it is incredible! Reading it and testing its theory you will discover the way the markets work. As a Futures trader is the book that has helped more than any other one my way of trading (That seems quite succesfully at the moment!). As a Member of IFTA (International Federation of Technical Analisys) is the book that I find more logical, because IT HAS A REAL LINK WITH THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AND EXPLAIN IT IN A SIMPLER AND FUNNIER WAY! The book is not supereasy to understand, even if it has been written in a very good way. Buon Trading!"

Funnily his video on this topic DOES update the book and cover Sector Rotation so Murphy obviously is aware of the oversight.This book is boring with no payoff. Murphy writes better elsewhere and this topic is covered better elsewhere too."
5,Great book. Period.,"I've read a lot of books on technical analysis, and this book is on the top of the pile. The relationship between other markets and other exchanges is explored. The intermarket theory is so simple, that's it's ingenious. Buy the book if your into trading. Period."
3,Pet Shop Boys - Se A Vida É (That's The Way Life Is),"SE A VIDA É gets two mixes each by by Mark Picchotti and Deep Dish, both aimed squarely at the floor. Mark Picchotti's Deep and Dark Vocal is accessible, for the most part retaining the peppiness of the original, but Deep Dish's Liquid Mix is much more dark and dense, putting the vocals behind a beat much more minimalistic backdrop until halfway through when a ghost of a melody filter through. The dubs of both mixes are nearly indistinguishable from their vocal coutnerparts -- just longer and more prone to repetition."
4,Curiosity gets the cat,"Hilary discovers a tryst between her husband and a maid. Hilary wrestles with her anger, guilt, shame, and, above all, her perverse arousal. Compelled to become a voyeur, Hilary learns the extent of her husband's promiscuity and the private deviations of heterosexuals. Striving to exact revenge through infidelity, Hilary soon discovers seceret longings within. Through a series of sexualy submissive encounters, Hilary tries to assuage her guilt and satisfy her deepest desires. This well written erotic novel is my favorite by Daniel Vian."
2,Not recommended as a historical reference.,"This book was meant for practicing neopagans and anyone that wants to have a better understanding of their beliefs. It is not, however, a very good reference for anyone looking for a factual history of the neopagan witch movement. It is written in line with their beliefs and dosen't give an accurate origin of either medieval witchcraft or the neopagan witchcraft, but instead gives history through their beliefs. For those looking for historical facts on the origins, written in an unbiased and scholastic manner, ""A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerriers, Pagans, and Heritcs"" by Jeffery B. Russel is a much more honest look, seperating the fact from rhetoric and historic from neopagan, and giving a complete history, origins and developement, of neopagan witchcraft."
5,One of the first 5 books every reader should get...,"Drawing Down the Moon details Pagan practitioners in the United States in a scholastic and intelligent way without being dry.As many have mentioned, the Nordic Reconstructionism section is horrid, but a factor of bad sources, not bad writing.This is the book to give to a library, a parent who doesn't understand your religion or someone who freaks out.Some of the people in the book ARE freaky, but most are so down home and simple that it is plain to see it is a REAL collection of studies, not just those who shout loud."
3,Not a light read but informative,It's considered part of the standard literature in the study of Wicca.
1,Misleading and extreme,"I am a practicing Witch/Wiccan of more than five years and this is by far the worst book on the subject I have ever had the unfortunate luck to have picked up. ""Drawing Down the Moon"" is a book that does not explain the religion as it was or is; it is an extremist vision of ""feminist Witchcraft"" that acts mainstream.. Last time I checked there was a balance; the Goddess and the God, but you would never know that by reading this book. It is akin to David Koresh writing a general explanitory book about Christianity. This is most definetly NOT a book for anyone who wants a book on the religion of Wicca and to say it falls under ""Witchcraft"" is quite a stretch."
2,Reads Like a Sociology Book,"I really didn't care for this book for what it was supposed to be: a look at modern Paganism. Too much of the time, I felt like I was sitting in an especially dry sociology class, learning about strange and exotic people who aren't in very close contact with reality. I felt she made Pagans look a little stranger than we really are... but maybe the Pagans I know aren't quite as ""exotic.""The scope of the book is broad, and persons interested in an overview of Paganism will surely get an education. Perhaps the christian fundamentalists could read this and see that they have nothing to fear. If you *really* want an overview of ""American Pagans today,"" save yourself the money and surf the 'Net instead."
5,amazing,"yes i know this is my third review on this book but i just cant make up my mind. okay when i first read this book i felt like alot of the pagan religions was becoming my was the only way and it scared me. but started thinking that wasnt the message the where sending they were saying this is what works for them. this is really excellent book, it was hard for it to keep my interest, but i am really glad i read it, because i truly do know more about my religion and its sisters. i enjoyed all the info about different religions i also liked the chapter to the man's religion in there, that was very interesting since i never read anything on that before. it was a good history book it showed how many different people practice paganism today. even though you read it and dont like it, you well most defenitely come out wiser. and also dreaming the dark by starhawk was an amazing book too."
4,Excellent Jury Room Reading--LOL!!!,"Seriously, though....""Drawing Down the Moon"" is the most complete and exhaustive overview of the whole pagan thing. Ms. Adler introduces the reader to a wide, wide range of beliefs and belief systems (even systems that don't believe in such a thing as belief!). This is a huge plus--this book has inherited a reputation as something of a pagan ""bible"", although Adler's intentions were simply to report on as wide a spectrum as possible. This also is a bit of a minus--she doesn't go into a lot of depth on any one group (if she did, the book would be in multiple volumes of thousands of pages each!), and tends to repeat herself a lot, as if teaching a course. For me, that is only mildly irritating, for I know that there is so much to learn in this book...I go back to it again and again. And yes, if you're stuck in a jury pool for a few days, why not shock your crossword-toting fellow jurors and proudly read ""Drawing Down the Moon"" while you wait for your case?"
5,Amazing!,"Even though this book is dated I loved it from start to finish. I got a sneak peak at what the world of the Craft looked like before I was born in great detail and I was able to extract much information that still pertains to me in my personal life. The names might be different or non-existant anymore but this book gave me an entirely different point of view of the world. I have read many Wicca 101 books but the most though provoking and intelligently written book that I have read so far is this one. It is so different from any Wicca 101 book because it focuses on facts, historical as well as social, but at the same time was spiritually guiding. I would recommend this book to anyone starting out in the Craft, even though it is outdated one must learn from the past before one can find their path into the future."
4,Informative,Solid book with good information for those interested in modern day paganism. More of a historical approach that helps a person understand how we got to where we are. Great read.
5,NOT NOT NOT ABOUT DRAWING!!!!!!,"I purchased this book back when it first came out and loved it, but for creative artists looking for books on DRAWING witches, this is NOT what they're looking for. It's a marvelous study on just what the title says -- REAL witches, druids, goddess-worshippers, and other pagans in America. This book was written to give people interested serious study of unusual religious practices, which it did very well.BUT IT WON'T TEACH YOU HOW TO DRAW ANYTHING WHATSOEVER!How this book ended up in a search string about drawing witches, I can't imagine. It's a SERIOUS study of alternative worshipping communities, but it won't teach you ANYTHING about DRAWING!!!!!"
1,Definitely not for beginners,"So many people recommended this book to me when I first became interested in Wicca but it was so boring and wordy and very hard to follow so I put it away and went to Scott Cunningham books and they were much better, 2 years later I went back to this book thinking I would be more connected to it now but still I find this book drab and boring. I prefer Silver Ravenwolfs books now."
3,People recommend this book. I fail to understand why.,"This book does not teach anyone how to practise Wicca, and has virtualy no rituals.This book is an autobiography of Ms. Adlers life and some of the various pagans she encountered in her travels"
2,begginers stay away,"i have to tell you that this book is very hard to understand and all it seems to me is a bunch of pagans whinnig about other pagans that do stuff differently, but i must say that it does say alot about other traditions but any pagan can survive with out it"
3,Good and important read,For anyone interested in learning more about what it out there in terms of paganism should read this book. It talks about various covens and the history of them including much of the pagan world. Drawbacks are that it is outdated in the sense that many of these covens have since dispersed and I think it does lack the actual historical facts that can be found about early pagan society. I would have liked to read more about that. But it is a definite read for anyone who wants to study the world of paganism and or follow that path for themselves.
4,Good research for the truly interested,"After eight years of studying and practicing the Pagan lifestyle I ran across this book and wondered why hadn't this crossed my path before? It answered so many questions that had been going through my head concerning what it meant to be Pagan, mentally. A truly in-depth look of the psychology, philosophy, and sociology of witchcraft, this book is not for light readers, but it is a great source of information concerning idealism and conflict in and around the Craft. It's a bit difficult to read it all in one sitting, but I think that's part of the point: to NOT sit down and read it all at once, but to take your time to contemplate what you've read until you fully understand it. It really helped further cement my beliefs and understanding of the path I have chosen. A must have for all Pagans."
5,The Most Comprehensive Survey of American Paganism,"What research Ms. Adler has done! She has taken off where Dr. Murray's work ended. Ms. Adler's book, however, goes even further in that her research encompasses what's happening right here in America. She covers all the traditions from the more ""traditional"" groups all the way through the ""new agers"" - from the Gardnerians to the Seax-Wicca, she has represented them all! Specifically, there are lengthy, in-depth chapters on the gay movement in wicca, as well as the very interesting ""Feraferia"" group launched by Fred Adams in California - perhaps the most interesting, misunderstood group of all. Whatever you want to know in this field, I'm certain you'll find it in this book. Bravo, Ms. Adler!"
5,Highly Recommended,"Adler explores the Wiccan and Neopagan movement, its history and origins, its relation to enviromentalism, feminism and LGBT concerns, and its often uneasy relationship with society. Informative and often humorous, this book covers a wide range of Pagan religions and Craft traditions. I recommend it for all Pagans or anyone interested in modern Paganism. Drawing Down is one of the best books on witchcraft and Neopaganism you'll find."
5,"Fantastic book, it Named my childhood identity...","My review title is a bit clumsy but... A thorough book that is a bit dated, it describes much of neopaganism - Wicca, witchcraft, Odinism, etc. It also gave me a name for beliefs I hid within my Catholic childhood - Mariolatry, perceiving Mary as Divine. Catholicism led me to the Goddess and Margot Adler's book was the critical step in cementing my private but unfailing knowledge of the Goddess. It gave me terms for ideas I had but couldn't name. I have since realized the power of words.I also hope for a sequel to this book as the Goddess and witchcraft have developed a stronger presence in the media and publications, some of which is misleading. Many thanks from a Dianic priestess."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"This book is one of the most clearheaded views of pagansm and the craft that I have read. It is perfect for the beginner (or anyone) who is interested in the recent history of Paganism, without being bogged down by others rituals. I would recommend this book to anyone, pagan or witch or none of thee above, it is an excellent sourcebook for the pagan movement in the United States."
3,"Informative, but difficult to get through","This book reads more like a college-level textbook than a book for ""common folk"". I found it very difficult to get through, very verbose, and at times even impossible to get through. That said, it is full of historical facts and information, I just found myself skimming and skipping large portions of text. The resource guide at the back is wonderful!"
2,"God in Drag, and other misadventures....",Witchcraft? Paganism? Strange aquarian orders? There's nothing transformative about these organizations. Read at your own risk.
1,Ripoff from first album....,"I loved the first album, ""Okeeblow"" - and was stoked to get this new one, ""Swax"". Little did I know it only had 5 new songs on it. The rest of the 7 songs were from the first ablum. What a ripoff. See the list of songs below, ones with an asterisk ""*"" are from the first album. So I wouldn't waste your money on this full album when you're really only getting 5 new songs. Granted the songs are good and I still like them, but come on guys....Disc Info:Scapegoat Wax / SwaxTracks on this CD-----------------Back AliveWatching The RainLost Cause*Crawlin'*FreewayBloodsweet*Space To Share*Eardrum*Perfect Silence*Aisle 10 (Hello Allison)*Almost FineBoth My Friends"
2,Willie's Goal,"Willie Johnson proves himself to be a drummer boy. Willie Johnson only wanted to be a drummer boy so badly because all his family would ever talk about was the military. Willie Johnson was from Vermont.Since he is now a drummer boy, he gets a fantastic golden medal from president Lincoln, himself, and he proves himself so well, he even impresses the comander-in-chief too! He is probably the first person in the world to do that. I mean seriously, who else has impressed the commander-in-chief and the president, before? Anyway, he is now a drummer boy, just like he wanted to be. Thats all that matters to him and his family.Willie Johnson gets to be in the front of the military line, stomping away and banging the drum as hard as he can, just wacking the sound out of that thing. He's loving it so much, but he's also nervous because of when the other troops come. Will he survive? Will he make it back home? What do you think will happen? Read the book by ..."
5,Mr. Lincoln's Drummer,"Fool the book Mr.Lincols Drummer is about this dude named Willie. Willie enters the army as a og drummer because he is to young to b a solder. I'd give the book 100 stars if I could,. ok. Now read the book. The book was so cool ok. Punk read it."
3,Mr. Lincoln's Drummer a piece of history,"This book was set in the time period of the Civil War. I thought it was interesting overall, but sometimes the war vocabulary was a little confusing and hard to follow. If I were more familiar with the geography of the area, it may have been easier to understand. If you like to read detail about historical wars, this book does that for the adolescent reader. I liked the main character, who showed s lot of bravery and character."
3,Ten year old goes to war!,I read Mr. Lincoln's Drummer. This book is historical fiction. This is a high 5th grade book. There is a lot of gore and sadness. You would love this book if you like to learn about the children of the Civil War and if you like to read gory books. The story takes place in Vermont and on the battlefields in the South. You should NOT read this if you don't like reading about blood or sadness in a book.
5,weddingstar cake topper,This is the cake topper for my daugheters wedding. It is beautiful but is not a real true white it is a creamy white which she wasn't too happy about becuase I emailed the seller and the responded that is it white. It is still very beautiful and they are going to make it work.
5,perfect,"The size was perfect for the 6"" top layer of the wedding cake. Adding a few fresh flowers around the topper to create a finished look made it absolutely beautiful! great quality and nice to have on a dresser later."
4,romantic,i love this cake topper. but i really wished it was a bit taller. it is exactly as you see it in the pic. But it will still be a great compliment to my cake.
1,Bad start - arrived defective,"Please note: this does not comment on the product itself, but it does show that the manufacturer may have some quality control issues.I replaced the slowly dying MAF sensor in my car with this refurbished one - but it did not work at all. We hooked the car up to a diagnostic system and concluded that the replacement part was defective. Of course, Amazon is great at exchanging it, but this is still a major hassle. The part was well packaged and looks brand new, but sending out totally defective part means someone failed to test it correctly before shipping it out."
5,Very Chill Very Good,"I give this CD a five star rating not for the typical jam Widespread Panic playing, but for the acoustic chill music that Mikey gives us. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANY THING YOU HAVE HEARD, but it is still a great CD. Lots of great tunes and Mikey explores all music by playing the guitar, piano and mandolin, with Sunny and John Keane helping out."
1,Mindless Drivel,"I listened to this CD when I borrowed my son's car and found it in his collection. I had no idea who Michael Houser was and had no preconceptions when I popped this album into the CD player. The music is monotonous and lightweight with no depth of feeling, no development of themes, no variation - relying on repetition of the same chords and throwing an occassional sibilant guitar string to add authenticity to his picking. This CD possibly would serve a purpose as background music in a boutique for customers passing through but to actually dedicate time to listening to these inane tunes would truly be a waste of time. For any of the previous reviewers to be blown away by this pretentious nonsense and take this music serious must have a very limited exposure to truly good music. I could go on but you get the point. Listen before you buy."
5,This album is really getting a bad rap...,"(4.5 stars) I bought this cd at a dimmu borgir show where these guys opened, the live show was absolutly amazing, so i decided to purchase this cd. At first I was dissipointed, very little double pedal, and odd vocals. But for some reason I found myself listeing to this cd alot, and it grew on me. They have a kinda dark thrashy style thats very catchy. I cant quite bring myself to give this album 5 stars though, but its still a great album. \m/"
4,"Great album, but ultimately, I prefer the original","One can find interviews with Peter Tagtgren pretty easily online, and he discusses the origins of this ""remake."" Catch 22 was a bit of a departure from Hypocrisy's previous releases, and I think it left a few fans scratching their heads. Personally, I loved the album. Bands should develop over time, and try new things, or else they go stagnant. I do get, however, why he released this album. The vocal styling is much closer to how one might expect Hypocrisy to sound. To paraphrase what Peter says about it: ""If you didn't care much for the original, then this album is for you.""With all that said, the album is still good. The new vocal tracks are well done, and in a few cases, they might even add a new perspective to the song. I'm happy with the album, and I feel that I'll be switching back and forth over the years. I don't think too many Hypocrisy fans will be upset with this album. Personally, I'm glad to support them!"
4,fine video,"i would jus like to say that the video works fine, i don't have n e problems with it and i would order products from this seller in the future."
5,DVD doesn't play on standard player,As with all other reviewers this is an excellent comedy. Probably the most iconic of Laurel and Hardy movies and maybe the funniest and best. Upon recent of the DVD I was not able to play it on my DVD player - may need a universal DVD player. Plays fine on the computer.
3,Another look at Oprah,"After a number of years during which only magazine and newspaper writers found Oprah important enough to discuss, in recent times there has been a spate of books about her, most from different views about her influence and importance to the reader. For the person who is not particularly intersted in popular culture or Oprah's influence on it, this work, while well researched and useful for students, is probably not one Oprah lovers would settle down to read in an easy chair."
2,"Nice router, short life","I've had this router for about 2 years ( out of waranty )As far as using the router, it's great. This router has never been mounted in a router table, so the bit size has always been under 2 inches. the router recently has started sparking where the brushes are located (replaced brushes , didn't help ). When I took to the dewalt service center they said repairs wouldn't be over a $100 ( a new one with 1 year waranty is only $200. I feel this router should have lasted longer especially since it has had very limited use."
3,Second time lucky,"Purchased the 621 as a result of extensive product test in a publication.Found the machine to be powerful, easy to use and well designed. Dust extraction is also a very useful feature. Found the base and some parts to be a somewhat crudely manufactured, but overall a workable machine.I am now in possession of a second 621, the first managed 20 minutes of work before expiring with a load shearing noise and refusing to show any additional signs of 'life'. Fortunately the home improvement store replaced it, no questions.Experience since then has been very positive. Extensively used with edge guide for heavy mortice work on oak - over many hours with no repeat. Hope this one does not expire shortly after the warranty!"
2,DW - Disposable wonder,"I've had similar experience with this router as other reviewers. I like the plunge mechanism and switch, but after short hours the switch lock stopped working and the electronic speed control failed. The speed erratically gets faster and slower. Brought it to a DeWalt repair facility in Denver. They fixed it without giving me an estimate. $160 to repair a $200 router, I don't think so. If it lasted longer I'd buy another one, but I think I'll buy a 2hp Bosch."
5,Still Great After 3 Years,"This router has been used heavily in all kinds of operations: edge trimming, making custom moldings, rabbets, dadoes, template work, etc. It was even accidentally dropped 3 feet onto concrete, but never missed a beat. Yes, the on-off switch is a little quirky, but once you get used to it, you'll be able to operate it frontwards, backwards and upside down. It has enough power to swing large bits, although you shouldn't try to make deep cuts in one pass (as with any router). If you need a solid router that will take serious use and even a little abuse, this one will not disappoint you. After countless bookcases, cabinets and picture frames, it's still going strong, with only cosmetic nicks and dings."
1,Quality control problems,"I bought a DW621 from Amazon less than 2 years ago. The motor/shaft bearings have been replaced 3 times - twice by the local repair shop and the last time by shipping it to DeWalt. The bearings just failed again. The tool has (maybe) 90 minutes' run time total. It has some good points, such as the plunge operation and handles (even the switch after becoming accustomed to it). But repeated bearing failure in home workshop use tells me there is some basic flaw either in the design or in this particular tool. I have other DeWalt tools and this is the only one that has been a problem. My guess is if you get one of the good ones, it will work well and last a long time. If you get a lemon, don't waste any time repairing it."
3,Great machine if you get a good one,"This is my second DW621 Plunge Router. The first one I had for about 5 years and used it moderately in my home shop. About two years ago I began having problems with it shutting down in the middle of a cut for no apparent reason. It finally got worse and lost power and RPM's so took it apart to see if brushes were faulty or a bad switch. They were fine but there is an ""electronics module"" built into the device that went bad, had to be replaced as a module. The cost was $102.00 at the authorized repair facility. For $180.00 I could get a new one on Amazon. I will use the old one for parts as the new one hopefully does not fry the electronics module."
4,Great Router,"This router is very solid and the adjustments for the depth settings are fantastic. I particularly like the 3 ""quick"" settings. These are very helpful when cutting speaker openings. The Dust collection works very well too, not near the mess to clean up. I have read some reviews concerning the switch /handle placement. I am not sure what these are about as I think the ergonomics are very nice. 4 star only because I haven't had it very long and will save the last star for durability."
4,More great fusion from 1970's Isotope,More great fusion from Isotope. More polished that Illusion (which may put some off) without the fuzz bass or el-piano. This time Gary Boyle is the main composer with Robin Lumly of Brand-X doing the production. Zoe Kronberger with Frank Roberts on keyboards. Zoe does some great wordless vocals on a couple of cuts and Frank Robert's el-piano playing are outstanding. Highly recommended to fusion fans.
1,Emperor's New Clothes,"Is this a case of emperor's new clothes? Mrs. Cantrell has a gracious southern hospitality about her. It's as though she is saying ""Step into my parlor and enjoy this music with me"". There is nothing wrong with that, but the impression left is that she is more a musical hostess than an artist. With most artists, the listener gets a sense of what is motivating them. This CD has an academic feel, passion-free. I found it hard to listen all the way through."
1,"Coulda, woulda, shoulda but wasn't.","This was a complete waste of time. The narrative and acting was well beyond below level and if I could give this film negative stars I would. During almost all of the narrative parts of the film, it sounded as if the""actor"" was reading off of a piece of paper and stumbling over what he was supposed to be saying while he had the same facial expression throughout the entire film. Utterly disappointed. And to whoever wrote the description on this film......maybe they should have watched it first as there is no one going into any state of ""mesmerizing paranoia"" let alone any paranoia.The only good thing was the music."
2,69 min too long,"The plot was interesting enough, the characters were believable, and the acting was tolerable. I could have given this film 5 stars if it were 15 min instead of 84. If you enjoy modern art museums and are especially affected by random splashes of paint on a canvas, then this movie will not waste 69 min of your life. This is, by far, the most boring film van Sant has ever made. My wife nodded off within 20 min of the start, and I had to force myself to find reasons to actually complete all 84 min. Also, before anyone accuses me of being an action film junkie unable to assimilate intricate character development and plot execution, I'm far from that. See some of my other reviews."
2,Warning,"This is one of those films that when the credits roll you look at each other in disbelief, its like the producers ran out of money and said Uh oh, looks like we got another Blockbuster Exclusive. Actually a good film, I just wish they had enough money for the rest of it."
2,Over-reaching skateboarding music video,Just your standard cute-teenage-boy-coping-with-responsibility-for-a-dead-man-chopped-in-half angst movie.
3,Good story.....,"Just watched ""Paranoid Park""!Good story,good characters, really interesting ""it could happen"" type plot!I wish it had explained things a little better at the end.Gus Van Sant usually doesnt disappoint and doesnt here.If you like this movie, check out ""Elephant"", its another Van Sant film and a good one!"
2,Painfully slow Park,"The two sentence sublot summary intrigued me enough to want to watch this movie. It basically took an hour and a half to tell a five minute story. If that's your thing...lots of slow mow and lingering shots of close ups of people's faces or objects, then you may like this movie. I know some of the shots and ""effects"" were trying to be artistic but by the end I was yelling at the screen, ""get on with it"". So, not for everyone but not terrible either. Rent before you buy defintiley."
3,Make sure you remove the batteries...,"Makes launching estes rockets safe and fun for children. But MAKE SURE you remove the batteries when not in use so that they do not corrode/leak. The product is not made with what one might consider ""rugged"" electronic components. If the batteries leak, they will corrode the contacts. The wires and alligator clips are chinsy. I speak from experience. I attempted to clean contacts in old ""electron beam launcher"" and they fell off. They could make the product with better materials."
4,Worked great,The controller was exactly what I expected and worked like a charm. This was the first rocket launching experience my kids and I shared and it was great!
2,poor and unsafe!,"this product is imho is a big fail. i build my own rockets now for 15 years, and used such a starter only once. its a fail and dont met any security guidelines for rocketry. the curent power going through the lamp is too high and may ignit your rocket engine accidently.dont leave your kids alone with this kind of controler, the engine may start accidently becauseof high current going through the lamp and the igniter may fire the engine. the 'security' key is kind a farce.also its very fragile and made of cheap plastic.get a wooden box, a low current led and a push button, 4x1,5v batteries and a keylock for safety.this is easily build and don't cost over $10 and will last for years, also suitable for hp rockets and looks much nicer."
5,The photos are what make it work.,"We have several of Mr.Florence's books, and in each case, the photos are what make it. He and his team go to great lengths to assemble and light the glass we are looking at and looking for. He has helped us both match and bypass glass we were not sure of. We'll buy again..."
5,Learning Free format RPG,This is a very easy book to learn RPG from. It is explained in easy to understand terms and language. If you know RPG IV and are trying to learn free format this is the book to buy. I have met the author and sit in two of the classes he thought and he is easy to learn from and makes learning fun.
5,Great Driver!,"This driver is great for beginners and more experienced players alike. When I first used this disc it added a good 30 feet to all my drives. What I like best about it is its flight path - it is a SUPER straight flyer, and will hold whatever line you put on it. Like most all discs, it does finish off hyzer at the end, but it works great for anhyzer shots as well as those beautiful S-shots. Along with the discraft flash this is one of the best drivers ever made!"
5,Inspired and led by God.,"Last day events should be read by everyone, both confessed Christians and those unprofessed. God is in control of the universe and when he makes a statement, it comes true.Does it seem that nothing seems to make sense any more? Do the everyday events seem prohetic? Yes. The earthquakes that happen with frequency, the storms and the cities being destroyed carry a warning about the last days of earth history. The events are to shake everyone into a better understanding about his word and commandments. We need to get ready for the wonderful event of his second coming."
5,Great book!!,"I you want to get a good view of the final events of this world, then you need to read this book."
5,Everyone Should Read This Book,"This book needs to be read as much as The Great Controversy. It is much easier to read, while still giving us a vivid picture of the end times. Categorized by subject for easy referencing."
5,Accurate and on time,"This book is on time and written for these times. The events of 911 speaks for itself. It's a must own and a must read, as prophecy on folds before our very eyes."
1,I' m not a seventh day Adventist.,This book is for Seventh Day Adventist no wonder I found it hard to read... I do not believe theway they do very strict on the Sabbath Day. I know the bible says that the Sabbath was madefor man not man for the Sabbath and that to some every day is the Sabbath meaning worshipGod everyday not just Saturday or Sunday. I won't bother reading all this book for those interestedlook up more about Ellen White here. [...]
1,What Happened to the Software?,"It is true that this book contains a CD, but the CD is of not much worth. There are forms there. One may fill out the forms, but may not save them!! The best you can do is print them so you had better fill them out right the first time because otherwise you will be starting from scratch, filling out the entire form again, hoping that this one particular page is correct.To my thinking, one should never look at this product as something that has ""software"" because it does not. It has ""forms"" that are not measurably worth more than what one might find on one's state website."
5,a fast paced mystery,"Oklahoma's Gold is an enjoyable read for any fan of the mystery genre. Ms. Long does an excellent job of developing her main characters and I felt an invested interest in their lives. Additionally, the Native American culture is woven nicely into the story.The story revolves around Jess Clinton, a fiercely independent young woman who has recently lost her parents. She moves with her younger siblings to Oklahoma to live with her Uncle Fred. Upon their arrival they discover Uncle Fred was the victim of a recent attack. This is just one of many strange recent occurences in the small town of Chickasha. The most enjoyable moments of the story happen as Jess begins to unravel the mystery of who is disrupting life as normal in Chickasha. Furthermore, it is fun to watch the relationship between Jess and Daniel develop as she begins to realize she does need the support of others."
1,Amateurish!,"The script, acting and cinematography are very amateurish in this indie film. Poor screenwriting has abrupt scene cuts and no set-up dialogue. The camera often focuses on only one actor in a scene. The music runs continually n the background and the actors mics have echo in them. Scenes are often overlit, and appear to be one-takes from the stumbled lines. How can you focus on an actor with no lines when the other actor has all the dialog? The story takes lace in 1945 but many of the sets are shot in buildings that are obviously of much later construction. Don't waste your money on this home video."
4,A great collection of an audacious poet's earlier works...,"This book of free verse poetry is a hoot. Marge lets loose with somewhat coarse diatribes against the injustices of life. She is the master of the unexpected declaration and the get-inside-your-skin simile. To have read her is to have lived… in an industrial world teeming with amorous parasites… in other words, the real one. She is probably the first poet I’ve read who I’d actually like to meet. She pulls no punches, lays it out in all vulgarity… and wonders at the futility. Visceral is an understatement. A very intelligent and imaginative diary of one being’s journey through the big mess."
5,Hope for Iraq,"Eric Holmes provides stories from Iraq that the media didn't want the public to hear before the presidential election. He's collected newsworthy events of what American servicemen are doing for the Iraqis, which wasn't possible under Saddam. Rather than how bad it is for Americans in Iraq, it's about the new schools, water flowing, electricity in buildings, and many of the comforts which Americans take for granted. It's also about the Iraqi citizens giving thanks to America for giving them a chance for a new life. Thanks, Eric for delivering the good news."
4,horror,this film is one you don't want to eat while watching. it's very good in the gore department. i really would recommend it to any one
2,Piece of Junk,The movie was suppose to take place in a demention between life and death????? What ever that means. Stupid. The acting is not very good and I didn't understand who or what the killer was. The effects were ok. the only real gru-sum part for me was at the very start of the movie with the hitchiker scene. That is why it gets two stars other wise I would give it just one. Don't waste your money.
2,I was disapointed,"I just recieved this book, and I'm sending it back. I was very disapointed - the illustrations are very subtle, and not very clear. My baby (1yr) is a very big book lover, but this book just didnt manage to catch his eye.the story is cute."
2,not that special - kinda cheesy,"I am nursing a book-crazy toddler and wanted more books around that depict this as the natural, wholesome, lovely event that it is. From the other reviews it seemed that nursing was just one aspect - not the main focus - of the story and I liked that. That is - I would have liked it if there was any particular story. There is no plot. And I wouldn't mind that - if the writing was better (rhyme, meter, and transitions between concepts are all very awkward). And I wouldn't mind THAT - if the art was more appealing. (Mom has a weird 80's Prince and the Revolution hairdo, for one.)I don't dig this book but my daughter thinks it's ok - hence, 2 stars."
2,It coulda been a LOT better.,"Shes A Queen is a half a**ed greatest hits collection.No linear notes or nothin.Some KEY tracks of her career are missing.Nuff Of The Ruff Stuff, and How Do I Love Thee, off of the Nature Of A Sista album.Weekend Love, and I Can't Understand, the 3rd and 4th singles off her Black Reign album.What woulda made the whole package hot is Winkis Theme, her trbute to her late brother Lance on the cd."
2,Textured Knits,"I, too, bought this book for the cover sweater. I am knitting it now and discovered that altho the photo shows the chevrons coming together at the side seams, they will not do so. The charts themselves do not provide for that happening. In addition, there is an error in the left front chart. This is disappointing, to say the least. I logged on to the publisher's web site and could find no errata."
2,Pattern shapes fall far short of fashionable,"I bought this book because I liked the texture of the sweater on the front. I was very disappointed to find that the book is full of straight-sided sweaters. There is not a fitted sweater to be found in the entire book! Regardless of how the type of sweater portrayed is meant to fit, every sweater knits straight up the side. Any clean-cut edginess that may be added to the sweaters by the texure is ultimately ruined by the shapelessness of the sweaters themselves. I vaguely considered altering some of the sweaters to have a more modern look, but I finally decided it's not worth it so I'm returning this book."
1,Narrow size range!,Any knitting book that can't be bothered to alter patterns for a reasonable range of sizes isn't worth the paper it is printed on.
4,"A little hokey, but a solid film with great performances","Good cop films are really important, and this is an excellent portrayal of the human side of law enforcement. What a find. It's a very convincing, gritty New York drama, something that is always appreciated. One of the film's strengths is its ability to shift from comedic moments into harsh tragedies, and in this sense feels like an accurate reflection on real life. Newman is absolutely convincing in his top rate performance, as is the rest of the cast. Which brings us to the plot - it's solid, but not dazzling. You have a sense it is trying to be a tour-de-force about police mentality and corruption but falls a bit short. But, for the rest of the film's strengths, this can be overlooked. Highly recommended."
4,IF ONLY LUMET HAD DIRECTED!,"If the GREAT Sidney Lumer (12 Angry Men, The Verdict,Q & A) had directed this film it would have had the potential to be a classic.No one is better than Lumet in getting at the bitterness and tension of the streets of New York,especially the racial and ethnic (Irish,Jewish,Black,Puerto Rican).Paul Newman plays an 18 year veteran Irish cop(Murphy) team up with a younger cop,palayed by Ken Wahl .This South Bronx police district is nicknamed ""Fort Apach"" because of its hign crime rate.Junkies,bad cops abound and Newman (excellant) trys to cope the best he can and thats' not easy considering what he is up against-High crime, a by the book new commander (Ed Asner) and very, very bad cops.The divorced Newman finds romance with a Puerto Rican nurse, movingly played by Rachel Ticotin and encounters a wacked-out hooker played by the very beautiful Pam Grier.This film needed LUMET and this DVD needed a commentary.Otherwise very good."
3,Newman is good as always but this film still lacks story.,"Paul Newman,one of Hollywood's living legends Does his best in this role but his presence is not enough to save this poor film. This is a film basically about the life of cops living in the bronx area and face day to day bad situations, such as corruption, greed, and random violence. But what this film doesn't make clear to the viewer is whether or not it's bashing the police or making a statement about urban reality. And by two thirds of the way in this film you really don't care how it turns out. One highlight of the film is when Paul Newman And Danny Ailleo were duking it out in the street. This film won't go down as one of Newman's best."
3,where am i buying this product from,most dissapointed in time taken to receive this product.I was under the impression was buying product from amazon in u.s.a. not germany. I note that cheap cardboard case has bar code imbedded in case.note u had my money for at least 30 days before i got itnot happy amazon
3,Just fair,"The script was a little hokey and the overall movie was nowhere near as good as I remembered from when I was 7 and saw it in the movies.Having said that, Pamela Grier was much better than I remembered her being. Her ... hooker with a razorblade smile defined my opinions on females for a long time to come."
5,my kids love this,"my 2 kids (ages 2 and 4) dance to this cd every day. the march around the house singing ""mommy knows best"". jeannie b's music is fun and enjoyable with great lyrics. a must have cd for your kids!!!"
5,Best Tunnel Trance Force album to date,"DJ Dean has again demonstrated his mastery of hard, German, progressive trance. From the start of the first song on the first disc right through the last downbeat on the second disc, DJ Dean has you at his mercy. With his heart attack inducing trance beats, euphoric drops, and heartwrenchingly beautiful melodies he will have you counting down the days until Tunnel Trance Force 19 is released."
1,not good at all :- ( vol 19 blows this cd !!,"i found 2 songs here that you might lisen 2 O.M.G :-( lisen to vol 19,12,7,14,15 there good !!!!! im giveing this sh_t away."
3,RE-POE MAN,"An intriguing premise undermined by weak performances, uninspired direction and some illogical plotting.Jeremy London greatly overacts his role of Ethan Poe, a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe, who is working on his latest novel. Pre-Gray's Anatomy Katherine Heigl is okay in her role of another Poe descendant. Poe himself appears as a ghostly apparition haunting Ethan. It doesn't take too long to realize young Ethan isn't playing with a full deck. A series of brutal murders leads local cop Nick Stabile to suspect London.It's all laid out in a smarmy neo-Gothic style with pseudo-erotic undertones.Could have been better with a better actor than London and a higher thrill quotient."
1,INCEST RUNS IN THE FAMILY,"The biggest butchering was what they did to the life of Edgar Allan Poe. This story is based on the false notion Poe not only had heirs, but the House of Usher was a factual story.Ann Hedgerow (Katherine Heigl) is the main character in this tell-tale. She inherits a rather large house. She is loved by her brother Keifer (Matt Farnsworth)is a most unhealthy way. She also has the the attention of a distant cousin Ethan Poe, who uses her to release his writer's block. Unfortunately Ethan is not all there and talks to the image of Edgar (Arie Verveen). Sex, murder, and bits and pieces of Poe's stories are used in the film.Outside of the brief nudity, the quality of the writing was made for TV. The acting was bad, but to honest, the script never gave them a chance. Available on a Wal-Mart 20 film multipack for $5.00Parental Guidance: No f-bombs I recall. Sex and nudity."
1,Nothin' goin' on but the rent,"Bleh! I bought this primarily because it was directed by HORROR OF PARTY BEACH's Del Tenney. He may have moved up in technical chops, but the story is a dreary mess without the promised-for horror and eroticism! It's one of the rare instances where I thought the DVD company should have paid me to watch it!"
1,Nevermore!!!,This movie is so off target. It wants to be a clever thriller/mystery but there are no thrills and the only mystery is when will this junk end. It was written by William Katt who's claim to fame is the 80's TV show greatest america hero. Unless you thought that was great emmy worthy TV you will not want to see this.
4,A solid effort,"If you're into bands like Asia, Toto and Marillion, this album should be just the right stuff for you. Good hooks, solid songwriting and crisp clear production. But for all it's modern production techniques, Magnum are still stuck in the past and the songs sound a little dated compared to the current music trends. It's kind of a retro trip to the 80's, but with better sound quality. It's a must have for Magnum fans, and a should have for Asia, Toto and Marillion fans."
3,So-so Magnum album,"I am a huge Magnum fan. Yes, the sounds on this is a little different, but there are some good tracks: Let Somebody In, Just Like January. However the rest of the tracks are a bit weak. Their old sounds much better (before Sleepwalking). I recently also got ""Brand New Morning"" which is a much better album than this one."
2,"Buy ""Vigilante"" instead!","I am so disappointed in this one. After so many years you would expect Magnum to do much better than this. Only a few tracks like ""Cry"" and ""This heart"" are enjoyable. You better buy ""Vigilante"" instead, an album with the same musical approach but so much better material."
5,Green Color Mist for a Green Alien Party,"I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms; for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.I'll use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys!"
1,I've never tasted bug spray suspect this is just as nasty.,I wanted to make a black and white cake so I got this at a store near me. As soon as I got home I sprayed a tiny bit on my hand and licked it. It smelled and tasted horrible. I threw it out within minutes of coming home from the store. I own quite a few Wilton products but would advise against getting the black spray.
1,horrible chemical smell,DO NOT BUY THIS! Thought this was a great idea. sounded quick and a fun way to add color to cakes. It did give color to the cake but the smell was horrible. Smellslike hair spray. Not something I want to eat or let my children eat.
2,Not a Complete Translation,"I agree wholeheartedly with the comments written by Edward J. Hynes. This version has several of Clausewitz's 'books' missing.I would like to add that in general, I tend to stay away from books published by Penguin Classics and prefer other publishers. For example, Oxford World's Classics 'The Gallic War' is a better, more modern translation of the first installment of Caesar's Commentaries with more maps and a better introduction that Penguin Classics 'The Conquest of Gaul.'"
1,The wrong translation,"On War is an essential work but this is an abridgement first published in the late 1960s and based on a poor translation dating from around 1908. The editor, Anatol Rapoport, is a scientist, not an historian, and the commentary is something of a hatchet job.Much better to get the 1976 translation with commentary edited by Michael Howard and Peter Paret."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF ON WAR!!!,"On War is an incredible work, but the Penguin Classics edition is terrible - the translation was done by an editor who was openly hostile to Clausewitz, something to do with Kissinger (whom our editor detested) being a Clausewitz fan. There are entire sections that are specifically translated in ways that make Clausewitz look bad, and edits to the same effect.I highly suggest that you read this book - but read the Everyman's or Princeton version - those editions have the Peter Paret translation and are far superior in every way. The Everyman's edition in particular is fantastic - hardcover, elegant, and only a few dollars more than Penguin's steaming pile of excrement."
1,"Only volume 1, poor kindle integration, buy another version!","I had just downloaded the Gutenberg edition for free, but that only included the 1st volume, so I wanted to buy the whole book. It said nothing in the amazon store that this would be only part of the book, but when I bought it I saw that it was only volume 1, and that I had spent money on nothing. Don't buy this edition! It is only part of the book. Also, the kindle integration is poor, e.g. Not direct kindle link to table of contents. I would want my money back, or a free switch to the book I thought I bought!"
3,hard to read,"I don't know if the translation is bad or Clausewitz could not express himself clearly but the book is hard to read. What do you make of paragraphs like the following one:""But after his [Frederick the Great's] skilful application of the system of husbanding his resources had shown the powers allied against him, through a seven years' struggle, that the actual expenditure of strength far exceeded what they had at first anticipated, they made peace.""Since Clausewitz is considered a classic, I am much more inclined to blame it on the translator. Everyone who studied German knows that you can't translate word for word. German grammar is different. They put verbs in weird places.I don't know if other translations are any better but this one is definitely hard to read."
5,Geo-Political Student,Very well written. A must have book for any student or practicioner of the Art and Strategy of War and/or the History of War.
3,Caveat Emptor,"""Buyer Beware!"" The Penguin edition of On War is abridged and is missing Chapters Five, Six, and Seven (actually Books Five, Six, and Seven). The Princeton edition and the Everyman edition are edited by Peter Paret and Michael Howard and are complete and unexpurgated. For some strange reason, the reviews of the Everyman edition of On War and the Penguin edition are combined giving readers the idea that reviewers are discussing one edition when they are actually talking about another. The only thing the Penguin edition has going for it is that it is cheaper, so it might be useful for college students taking a course during 1 semester. Otherwise, get the Everyman edition."
1,"Its the ECONOMICS, stupid !!","-Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or ""ON WAR"" has completely missed the point here.-The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or ""On War"" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.-The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?-That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of ""ON WAR"".-Its the ECONOMICS, stupid !!"
2,An unwieldy translation,"In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).If this is the only one you can get, then live with it. The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it."
1,Buy a different version!,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who said this is a terrible edition. Perhaps the average reader may prefer this abridged edition, but if you really want to know Clausewitz (like or dislike him), you're doing yourself a disservice to read this instead of a better work (like the Everyman edition mentioned before). I can hardly believe this was published as a Penguin classic because I have some great Penguin editions in my collection. This just isn't the Clausewitz book to get."
5,Conceptually masterful - poor Translation,"I believe that this book approaches more strategic thought - as it pertains to business and modern strategic planning - than it pertains to modern warfare. A must for most international business people and financiers. I would not advise anybody to accept the dated (war) tactics as gospel truth but rather conceptualize the depth of proposed strategic thought carefully, internalizing and putting into practice in modern competitive business scenarios.If one wished to be a successful, international corporate leader, one must keep von Clausewitz close to the heart. Not for the weak minded!The translation of this edition is horribly mechanical, sentences are way too long and hard to follow (although that would be the case in the original German).Prosit!"
1,This one is much better,"I have the On War published by IAP, in November 2008 and it costs just US$9.99. I like it. I don't know why it is not listed when we search it."
3,A thoughtful look at perceiving the world,"A thoughtful missive on how the interface between users and products, whether an old MG, Disney World, or computer software, reflects and affects our view of life and the world. Not being a programmer it was a bit dry in some of the sections on different OS options, the details of which seem to bother other reviewers. But since I took that subject to be the Macguffin used to make his point about perception, metaphor, and choice, and since I'm to ignorant to know better, those sections didn't bother me too much.And having read most of his work it was interesting because it sheds light on some of my favorite scenes in his novels, Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash in particular, which made it enjoyable. And like the Morlock he is, he ends with a challenge to accept life or deal with it. It's a fairly short book to read, for me an enjoyable and interesting way to spend a couple of hours at the beginning of a new year."
1,Not worth reading,"I don't see a reason to buy this book. Nothing Stephenson has to say is new or interesting - anybody who'd consider buying the book has most likely read articles about the ""OS Wars"" for years now. This book rehashes the most commonly made points, seemingly without much thought. More than that, Stephenson makes his points using elaborated metaphors which are so smug and self-assured (and trite - he compares OS's to cars throughout the course of the book), I found them actively annoying."
2,You get what you pay for,"Like far too many like him, Stephenson confuses his own obsessions with what is good for mankind. Given what he is, and what he knows, the old example from the Jargon File applies only too well:d00d! u R 1 331337 haXoR!The book may as well have been called ""Angel/daemon's introduction to theology for pagans"". Of course, it will find an audience, at least before the stock market collapses."
2,Disappointing,"I can live with my disagreement with this essay's premise, but I just can't respect the way Stephenson makes his argument. The analogies are flawed, the tone is bombastic, and the writing is careless. A major disappointment after the brilliance of Cryponomicon. Stephenson should stick to fiction."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Yes, it is short, and parts of it are amusing. And, yes, Stephenson does make some interesting points. However, this book has two fundamental problems. First, the prose is so clunky that I found the book painful to read. I am a software engineer: beyond working, the software should have beauty in each line. Similarly, when I read, I don't just want information: I want to feel the flow and beauty of the language. My second problem with this book is that, while it is short, it only has enough material for a book one-quarter the size. Borrow it from a friend and read the first chapter - that's all you'll need."
3,"Coders, Hackers: All Else Beware","Reading the book, I felt like I had wandered into a strange neighborhood bar where the local good fellow was ranting on and on about how ""authentic"" experience and free will could only be had by using a non-Windows operating system (and a non-Mac also). Somehow, we'd all be more intelligent, critical thinkers, if we invented our own operating systems. Why stop there? Why not build our own computers? And I don't mean buying off-the-shelf parts, but actually getting our own silicon, wiring, etc. This book really is for techies, and not for those who regard computers as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Although the author tries to create a larger context (""we should make our own decisions""), his own history of screwing around trying to set a system up is pathetic. I'd rather be hiking, surfing, or riding, than waste more time trying to reinvent the wheel."
2,Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick...,"While I did buy and read this book cover to cover in about 3 days, I regard that time spent as wasted. Stephenson, while a flashy fiction writer, left me wanting in this essay based on the evolution of the user interface. I will admit he managed to eek out a few brilliant remarks and commentary, (find the metaphor dealing with the OS car dealerships), but overall the essay was a poorly disguised rant. Stephenson manages to whine and carry on like a 8 year old with a stubbed toe for around 150 pages. I salute his fiction writing abilities, but the man is no sociologist."
3,"A Quick, Light & Entertaining Read","I had never heard of Neal Stephenson before and got this due to the intriguing title. Working in IT (as a DBA) I firmly believe that GUIs with their ever expanding feature sets are de-skilling certain important technical tasks. This is creating a new breed of IT professional who is very proficient at 'point-and-click' but who has little to no idea what is happening in the background. I wanted to see what Neal Stephenson had to say about this and the answer is not much. I can sum up his book by saying it talks about how operating systems should be free, how Apple (MacOS) and Microsoft (Windows) are as bad as each other in terms of their approach and market stance and linux is wonderful. He makes a few good points and some clever wise cracks towards the end, but overall it was light, entertainment rather than a serious insight into technological issues."
4,Short But Sweet,"Part overview, part rant, part investigation of the interaction between culture and the metaphors of abstraction, and all Stephenson. A very fast read, that never gets lost while ricocheting across quite a bit of terrain. Only for people who have experienced frustration using their computer...or, put more succinctly: only for everyone.If you're wanting this book for yourself because you're a Stephenson fan, it's only flaw is that it's too short. If you're wanting this book because you have an interest in how computer use relates to society, it's only flaw is that it's too short. If you're wanting this book as a gift for someone else, you only have to ask yourself one question: do they have a computer? If so, they will value this book as a gift."
2,"Short, and Sure to Please [some] Unix Lovers","A short book, really an extended series of articles, portraying Stephenson's various experiences with operating systems -- DOS, Windows, Mac OS, and the various shades of Unix/Linux.It is not at all a necessary read for fans of Stephenson's fiction.Neither is it a necessary read for anyone well informed about OSes -- you'll have your own opinions and undoubtedly argue vociferously with Stephenson. Those interested in learning about how PC operating systems got this way could use this book as an overview, but it is incomplete, not attempting to present all sides or histories, but just anecdotes of what Stephenson has encountered, and his thoughts as to why it is that way.Perhaps the only readers of this book to be rewarded are those seeking a minor insight into Stephenson, himself, as his first-person approach is revelatory."
2,"A passable opinion piece, but with tedious writing.","The opinions in this are most superficial but generally interesting, and make for an undemanding afternoon's read.But good God, do we have to picket Stephenson's publisher to get an editor assigned to him? Stephenson says in four paragraphs what he could just as well say in two sentences. Much of this essay reads like someone just strung together the posts in a ranty Usenet thread. This, folks, is the kind of thing an editor is supposed to stop from happening. And unlike most bad writing, it's a /pity/, because this could have actually been a very good essay."
1,Serious lack of knowledge,"Neal is out of his element here. This is his personal viewpoint of how the PC world developed during its early stages. Unfortunately there is a lack of understanding of how all the parts of this history fit together as well as a lot of just plain mis-information in here. If you want an accurate view pick up ""Fire in the Valley"" by Freiberger and Swaine."
4,Outdated but informative and interesting anyway.,"Stephenson's perspective and insight, along with his use of analogy, makes for a good read. It helped me to think about the choices we make as consumers.It probably won't change your world and it's become dated, but the question of how we got from typing arachic strings to GUIs for everyone is worth some consideration. The lack of historical completeness is not too regretable, as it probably helps with the clarity of the analysis."
4,Excellent Text I could relate to.,"Having gone to college for CS, worked in a Comp-Lab while there, and assumed a programmers role in the 'real-world,' this book really hit home.I greatly enjoyed the converstion - as you almost feel like the book is a dialogue, not a one-sided text solely speaking to you. The amount I was compelled to agree - to the point of nodding my head and sometimes laugh at metaphors - just made the read very enjoyable and effortless."
3,"Naaah, not so good",I do not agree with the other reviewers that this is such an excellent commentary. For being a Word commentary it is rather brief. Hagner does not deal with all the issues you wonder about. D.A. Carsons commentary in EBC vol 8 is much better. I also have Davies/Allisons ICC commentary (the first volume) and that is even better if you can take the price and the technical nature of it.
4,Mobile Base works as it is supposed to,"The base comes pretty much ready for use and once the power tool is on it, it works as described. It's pretty sturdy once the machine is on it but it is not that stable so I strongly recommend help getting the machine loaded properly in place. I found out the hard way it doesn't stay still while trying to ""shimmy"" my jointer onto the mobile base even with the wheels locked. Be smarter than I was and it should work fine."
1,some things are worth waiting for,My name is Douglas Hampton and I bought the merchandise. This item was on back-order for a month and when I got it both of the caster lock knobs were broken
1,THIS IS JUST STUPID !!!!,"I love my LOW-BUDGET horror movies like ""REDNECK ZOMBIES"" Dante Tomaselli's ""HORROR"" & Tobe Hooper's ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" & i also love my big budget horror movies like ""HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES"" ""CABIN FEVER"" & ""ALIEN"" & every other good fun horror movie that is in between! BUT THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING GOING FOR IT! ITS A REDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME! ITS ANNOYING! THE STORY & THE ACTORS JUST DIDN'T PULL OFF WHAT IT SEEMED THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PULL OFF!WHAT EVER THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN! ANYWAY IT JUST SUCKED IT WAS STUPID DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!! later on fellow horror fanz!"
1,YAWN,"An ""artsy"" attempt at horror that falls flat on its face. Acting and direction are amatuerish, and the movie's score overrides so much of the dialogue, you want to scream. It has a very slow and ill-acted opening, and it takes forever to get to any meaty substance. Role playing games come across even more banal than I had thought. Miss this one--there are no chills here!"
1,Socialism & Upheaval,"I read the introduction to this book and then I threw it in the trash where it belongs. One example: Plesch thinks shareholders (owners) of a corporation should be fully liable for the actions of the corporation. Yet he fails to address how the resulting catastrophic disaster in financial markets would be addressed if shareholders were fully liable for even passive (mutual fund) investments in corporations. How many people would invest money in a corp if they had to put all their personal assets on the line to invest? If you went to get a mortgage to buy a house, would a bank fund your loan if you were an investor and fully liable for a corporation's actions?If you are a secular progressive socialist ultra left wing liberal, this book is for you. If not, buy a more interesting book like, say, ""The Thermo-dynamic Properties of Steam."""
1,Tiresome,I had hoped for a rolicking sea adventure-what I got was a very long and tiresome description of life as it might have been in the Carribean among a thoroughly unbelievable cast of characters. To compare this with Marryat or O'Brien is indeed a travesty.
1,What a shame.,"I was really disappointed with this film as there is some really good US Navy stuff that they could have included, but it was full of errors. I gave it to some kids who did not know any better, waste of money."
5,I love my Rocketdogs!,"My Rocketdogs are awesome! I saw them in the store for months before I purchased my own pair. Now, I am looking for two more pairs to buy because they are sooooo comfortable and versatile. AND they come in so many different colors. Any one should be able to find a pair that matches their individual style."
4,Only one problem with these,"The only problem I have is the stitching on the toe came undone within the first 2 or 3 wears. Other than that, no problems so far. They are comfy enough to wear all day on your feet!"
4,Awesome style.,"I'm surprised with these sneakers, they're so incredibly comfortable, and they're stylish as well. With a nice pair of jeans they look very grunge rock, not to mention unique -- People always want to know what kind of sneakers I have. I have the ""Natural Country Plaid"" design, by the way. :)The strange part about it is that, honestly, I'm a guy! I kind of wish Rocket Dog would make a few men's models. Either way, doesn't bother me, I'm not embarrassed to wear a ""woman's"" shoe. The pair I have feels slightly too snug on me, but it doesn't stop me. I love these shoes because it feels like I'm wearing nothing. Really rad."
5,Awesome,"Wish it did not end. Descriptions eloquent. Poetry was written of fondness for nature and the man, Muir. A true classic."
4,interesting piece of film history,"Warning: this is NOT an action movie. You will be disappointed if you're expecting to see a lot of details surrounding the planning and execution of a major heist. Get Rififi if that's what you want.'Bob' is stylish, leisurely paced, and NOT a caper flick (or barely qualifies as one). The film is not about a heist, it is about Mr. Bob and his all-consuming passion for gambling. Gambling is his sustenance, his downfall, and his savior. Women only seem to bring trouble (except for Yvonne, the cafe owner). How he acts and thinks, his values and judgments, are part of the old world of gangster-gentlemen which doesn't exist any more. It is, like many French films, a study in character, and what an interesting character it is!"
4,What about Bob?,"The story of Bob is a very good one. Told by the expert hands of Melville, Bob le flambeur sucks you in with wonderfull pacing, integrity and a strong sense of itself. The movie is about a crook of a dying kind - honorable and civil (the movie hinted that Bob was part of La bande à Bono; who invented bank robbing with a gateway car!)- who wants to hit a big scrore before fading out in retirement. Bob le flambeur is a joy to watch because the movie is not afraid to take it's time in telling it's story. Not to say that the movie is slow, the pacing let's you soak up the atmosphere and the feel of things. When a movie of this kind is well done (as it is the case here)you get caught by it and you will always find yourself with a renew desire to watch it again. To me this is the best reason to warrant a purchase, and furthermore, Bob is a realy cool guy."
4,THE GOOD THIEF,"I would say that BOB LE FLAMBEUR is a very good film, but somehow not as satisfying as Neil Jordan's remake THE GOOD THIEF, with Nick Nolte."
3,The film from the time French cinematography lead,"In the pre-computing epoch of simply believing into Lady Luck ex-crim Bob made a living in the France of the fifties last century with gambling (and hidden proceedings of money snatched earlier eventually) but as money vanishing, stipulated to consider some fresh vault-riding to influx into his life-style practically.Regrettably, accomplishers are big-moused and plans reached police-while Bob is on a top of a gambling success once again and full with resource and good humour to play a next set of game called ""rule of the law French style"" as clear from that work.A good testimony to then France environment."
3,Slow but stylish crime drama,"The Bottom Line:Melville made his living crafting films like this but Bob le Flambeur can't hold a candle to other offerings like the masterful Army of Shadows: it shows a good deal of creativity in setting up the central heist (I particularly enjoyed the scene in which the men plan out the bank on a soccer field, using lime to sketch out teller's desks and so on) but never really develops enough urgency to make it a compelling or fast-moving film.3/4"
2,Worked well until untimely death at 3 months of age,"It worked well, easy to install and operate, until its early death after 3 months of very light usage.Technical support was available via Internet chat, but the phone lines were busy. After an hour and a half of unsuccessful attempts to revive the DVD burner, technical support asked me to send it over for replacement. I paid for shipment and waiting to get it back.Update: It came back after a month and a half and worked well since. again, I am a very light user.Will update..."
2,My Easter Present,"This is a great bionicle set! I just got it today. My brother got another bionicle and we fight with them. I rated this bionicle 5 for fun because it is really fun, my favorite part are the wings that are retractable. I rated this education 4 because you dont really learn much except for buildin skills. I rated this bionicle 4 for durability because when i try to lift something up with its talons its leg falls off sometimes. overall this is an awesome toy."
3,Good fuzz-guitar pop rock,"The Poises had the misfortune to come out of the Pacific Northwest with a pop oriented sound shortly before the eruption that was Nirvana's ""Nevermind."" Instantly, their music seemed outdated. ""Dear 23"" is a good album of pop rock that hits its peak with ""Golden Blunders"" and the epic ""Flood of Sunshine."" Not bad for a 90s nostalgia party when people start having them."
4,excellent,"I love this version of Wuthering Heights.Tom Hardy is an excellent Heathcliff.Charlotte Riley portrays Cathy as more innocent than the original story made her.Cathy was not quite the spoiled, selfish girl that was intended but she is a good actress.This story is not true to the book in several ways but still worth viewing.It has actually become a favorite of mine."
5,Beautiful,"Hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, a picturesque backdrop of the Moors, along with a spot on performance of my favorite adaptation of Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights.""Tom Hardy, as Heathcliff, emanates a dynamic portrayal of this tortured hero.Charlotte Riley is the picture of exactly what I imagined Cathy to be. So beautiful and carefree.If you love the book as much as I do, you'll be pleased with this adaptation of Emily Bronte's only published masterpiece."
4,Great film. Poor PBS editing.,"My wife and I love this film. Beautiful, romantic, disturbing and timeless. But PBS kills a wonderful ending with an abrupt chopping of the ending and quick jump to solicitation for the sale of the DVD. There should be more time added to permit the end of the story to linger, allowing the viewer to absorb the moment. It's a shame and very insensitive to the film. The part 1 and part 2 division should be removed for greater enjoyment of the presentation as well."
3,wuthering heights,i really did not like the movie.if you do not watch it close you will not under stand it.and it bounces from one life time to another life time.so i would say if you buy the movie try to get it cheap as you can.
5,Hurts So Good,I've seen several versions of Wuthering Heights and this was far and away the best. It was the most human. I would have prefered a little more ghostly chill of the book but this adaptation really managed to capture the heart of the story.
3,As someone who's never read the novel...,"nor seen any other version of Wuthering heights, I must say I found this movie to be a bit too melodramatic. I believe it would be easier to understand the things going on if one is already familiar with the story in some way. As someone who wasn't I found the organization of some of the scenes confusing and the characters (the male ones especially) seeemed incomplete in some way. But perhaps I've been spoiled as the last thing I saw before watching this was both seasons of Downton Abbey which is impeccably character driven."
4,Well...,"The DVD has some sort of flaw in it, not a scratch. It takes a few tries to get my player to recognize it, but it plays just fine once it gets going. I decided to live with it and not return the DVD based on that issue.I bought the DVD after watching the show on Amazon. Tom Hardy is great in this movie. There are a few moments where I didn't understand why he played the character a certain way, but overall he did great. The exchanges between Heathcliff and Catherine bring me to tears, just like they did in the book. Being a PBS production, I am sure that the budget was tight, and you will have to forgive a few things, like Heathcliff's wigs."
3,"Interesting, but also somewhat disappointing","An interesting take on the novel, but takes a lot of liberties, obviously to try to make the movie more ""salacious"". None of the changes are ""harmful"" to the story, but if you've read the book, you do notice the differences when comparing.In my opinion, the scenes jump around too much and the overall movie does not flow smoothly.This Heathcliff is quite tame and boring compared to the book & prior versions of this movie.If you just want to watch a movie with a storyline BASED on a classic book, it is worth a watch, but if you are expecting a movie that is more like the book, this is not the one."
2,Too many liberties with the novel...,"This is a modern attempt of showing this interesting story on film and the director took too many liberties with it. The sex scenes were unnecesary and unfortunately show BBC's attempt to spice up the stories, but what they don't get is that these are great stories with implied sexual content that we don't need to see! Leave something to the imagination, please. Remember the opening minutes of the new Sense and Sensibility? Same thing. Completely unnecessary to the film (but I liked Sense and Sensibility). This version of Wuthering Heights was just too much. Heathcliff's demise was the straw that broke the camel's back. My overall impression of this version was ""blah""."
4,Amazing!,"I love Wuthering Heights the book. I have read it so many times. I loved this version of the movie it really brought the best parts of the book to life for me. The only thing I did not like about it was how they made Heathcliff die. He is suppose to die of a broken heart pining for Cathy after her death but instead they have him kill himself by shooting himself in the head, or Hindly kills him I am unsure which. Either way they changed it."
2,Just didn't like it.,"I doubt I will watch this movie again. I didn't like the characters, I think Tom Hardy is one of the worst actors I have seen. As for the sex scenes that everyone is so outraged over, they were practically nonexistent. I watched the original Wuthering Heights when I was very young, and although I don't remember everything about it, what I do remember was better than this."
1,This can't be the same story,"I watched this when it aired on PBS, I'm so glad I didn't buy it. The acting isn't that great and the actual story has been horribly changed. In fact it's so reduced it's not even an hour long! And the ending! SPOLIER ALERT! I can't believe they had Heathcliff kill himself, that is completely out of character for him. It's just awful! Don't waste your money on this version. I think the Ralph Fiennes/Juliette Binoche version is much better. Fiennes makes an outstanding Heathcliff. The only thing this movie can boast of is the scenery/settings but that certainly can't save it from the ruin that was made of the story."
1,Horrific.....really awful.....,"I own the Orla Brady, late 1990's version of this from the BBC, and I absolutely love it! And I just as vehemently HATED this version. The male lead I saw in The Virgin Queen a few years ago, and he was fine as Robbie--not inspiring, but ok. In this, he is wooden. The female lead is new to me, but I did not care for her, either. I felt the residence used for Wuthering Heights was too grand, not at all appropriate. I hated the music score, or what I remember of it anyway. I have seen other projects (perhaps The Virgin Queen was one of his?) by this director, and I liked them. This I completely disliked and had difficulty sitting through."
1,Broken,"The disk came broken in half. I trashed it! I did not want to even give it 1 star, but I had to, in order to post this."
2,Trying too hard to be hard,"I love Dre's music. I love just about everything he's done. But this CD is just too much. Everybody knew, way back when Cube was still hard, that he was the soul of NWA. It seems like when he left, the real hardness left, and this record is full of a bunch of weak bragging about how they're gonna ..., and get paid.You might say, what's the difference between that and ""The Chronic?"" I don't know. No doubt that the Chronic is an all-time classic, but the chronic doesn't sound mean-spirited and empty like this disc.Now, there are some great songs. How ""Dayz of Wayback"" managed not to be an all-time classic? I don't know. ""Real Niggaz Don't Die"" is another good track. But even beat-wise, this disc doesn't hold a candle to his best productions.NWA without Cube is like a tv without a remote. Useless. ..."
2,don't bother,"this cd just wears on you. The beats are so hard that is hard to hear the lyrics at points. They rap about the same things and Eazy sings on a couple songs. If you copped it then, it was a banging CD, but for now, rap has come too far. don't bother with this one"
3,gangster (c)rap,"Great production, some good 'rapping' but lyrically and content-wise it's below average. Does include 100 miles EP which is a plus but those songs are the same, sound good but poor message.Years later, it continues to seem almost 'too hardcore' and not nearly enough substance."
2,excruciatingly detailed treatise on the obvious,"While I liked the organization of the book (each chapter written by a different ""expert"") with few exceptions, there was very little practical knowledge delivered despite the abundance of minutia. For example, one author went into great detail about visual perception: proximal vs. distal stimuli, how the eye tracks across text, etc., but conclusions drawn were SO obvious, they could have been culled from the most basic design books (avoid crowding the letters in text; it makes it hard to read). Duh. From the title, I was expecting more human factors information, and less ""no sh*t, sherlock"" design tips (FYI the discussion on proximal and distal stimuli lead nowhere, and those were the most technical terms in the book)."
3,OK For Budget Systems,"PROS: Reasonably quiet. Runs fairly cool, with enough reserve power for a basic build or an older system.CONS: Floppy drive connector wires too short unless CD/DVD drive is located close to floppy. Poor AC noise filtering compared to other ATX supplies - radiates a lot of RF hash back through the AC line."
2,too long,"While basic baptist beliefs were there, I felt like I was wadding through unnecessary theological jargon.I realize this was a dissertation, and it read as such.Also, in my opinion,the author repeatedly mentioned congregational polity as the NT model with no scriptural support. I have concluded that we have gone too far with the priesthood of the believer and actually deny the clear teaching of scripture that pastor/elders have the authority to shepherd and rule the local church. This book will argue for the absolute authority of scripture, and then force our cultural form of democracy on the NT text and its church. Why would we do this?Just a thought!"
1,"This ""MacBeth"" DVD won't play on our DVD player","I ordered this movie for my sister, a high school English teacher in the United States, to show to her students. All of the information in the description of this DVD led me to believe it would play fine on any DVD player. When my sister tried to play it on her DVD player, it would not work. The only way she can play it is to hook it up through her computer. This is a disappointment."
2,"Okay, but could be better","I thought that this movie, although true to the text, could have been a bit more exciting. Orson Welles does all movies well, but I always find them a bit boring."
3,Macbeth-Acting Could Have Been Better,"I rented this version of the movie Macbeth from Orson Welles for a class I was teaching. We had just finished Macbeth and I showed this movie to my classes. They did not enjoy it to say the least. I previewed it before I showed it and I'm a little sorry I did show it.The movie was acurate to the play and full of suspense, but in my opinion the acting was poor. That was the only complaint. I tolerated it, but my classes were bored with the acting. Bad acting can hurt a play no matter how good the play was or who wrote it.I have only seen one other play with worse acting than this, I'm sorry to say.I have seen better Macbeth movies out there and plan on showing them to my classes. From the other reviews I have read I'm in the minority, but this was only my my opinion."
2,Blu-ray review,"This DVD is no frills.No sub-titles, no special features. It appears as if the transfer was from the Korean DVD.Sad but true."
2,I Liked Hamlet Better,"I rented this video a few years ago, and was very disappointed. I got bored, and I was very unhappy that I did get bored. I loved Hamlet(the Olivier one), loved Julius Caesar(with Marlon Brando), loved Romeo and Juliet(Whiting and Hussey), but I was watching the clock with Macbeth. I guess you could say MacBeth is not my cup of tea."
2,Wake Orson with thy knocking,"Except for ""Touch of Evil"", made a decade later, ""Macbeth"" was Orson Welles' last directing job for a major studio. Just seven years after wowing the movie world with ""Citizen Kane"" he cranked out this practically unwatchable Shakespeare howler that looks as though it were edited with a Veg-o-matic. It's part of the ""modernist"" conceit that an artist should completely disregard his audience, and Welles sure followed the letter of that law here. Between the indistinguishable sets, garbled dialogue, bad lighting, troglodyte costumes, mismatched shots and jumbled continuity, even someone who knows ""Macbeth"" by heart will have a hard time following what's going on. If you're a Welles fan it's worth a once-over; if you're a Shakespears fan there are plenty of better versions."
4,Wrong DVD zone,"The movies was good, but did not follow the play linearly. The DVD it did not work on my DVD player because of zone conflict."
5,A Comic Chemistry Class,"Matthau and Lemon in an underated Billy Wilder film from the mid sixties. Once again Wilder and Diamond put a regular fella in a morally compromising position. Jack Lemmon, a divorced television camera man is involved in an accident with a football player, then is coereced by his low life brother in law, Walter Matthau, into pretending he is paralyzed from the impact and a law suite is put into motion. It is a funny and touching story, wonderfully directed and watching Lemmon and Matthau is always a double treat."
4,Laying Out The Chemistry,"Walter Mattahu was playing mostly "":heavys"" in films for about ten years until ""The Fortune Cookie"" He wins an Oscar for role and ""this is not one of his better roles""?From this point ..on in his career ..how many more ""heavys"" did he play? The great team of I.A.L. Diamond and Wilder are at work here and its fun all the way.Cliff Osmond is a standout.A real glimpse of Old Cleveland Municiple stadium and a younger Keith Jackson are a bonus for sports fans.What ever happened to Judy West, who plays Lemmon,s ex ( running of with Gus Gilroy)?Watch quickly for the great Sig Rumann as a doctor ( Fake""! )"
5,barry works it,"Barry Manilow took some of the greatest songs from the seventies the decade that lauched his carrer and made each song his own beautiful,flawless, arrangements and powerful vocal make this Manilow's Finest houryet. A must for every Barry Fan .A fan"
5,A Well Thought Out and Non-Vindictive Evaluation,"I have been to the Gothard seminar three times. There were a lot of valuable things about it, but I found that the more I attended and the more I listened, the more stifling it became.I appreciate Bockelman's book because it answered a lot of nagging questions, the most important being ""Is Bill Gothard trying to get us to obey the old Jewish laws?""For anyone who would like a basically supportive but realistic evaluation of Bill Gothard's ministry, I would strongly recommend this book. It was written over 20 years ago, but still applies."
1,No longer in business!!!!,Very disappointed after buying!! The animals are cute but the company has gone under and you no longer get to name a star. The website is [...] if you want to check it out.
4,Great little pet,I purchased this Lyon for my grandson 8 yrs old. He was so excited and happy with it. His school is using this shining star lyon in his classroom also. Shipping was very fast. very pleased with shipper and item
5,"""Indiscreet""","This is one of my favorite comedies. It's an old one, so no graphic sex or violence, just great acting and funny dialogue. I hope they don't remake it because Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman were wonderful."
5,Indiscreet,"The quality of the movie was very good. I enjoy the movie, or else I wouldn't have ordered it."
2,"Excellent movie, mediocre dvd","It is tragic that this classic film had to be marred by an unrestored treatment of the picture quality. I got it anyway because I don't use the VCR these days. Like everyone else, I hope for this to get to blue-ray, mabe then it will actually look better than VHS tape!"
3,Pretty good until . . .,"Ingrid Bergman falls in love with playboy Cary Grant. In order to keep her at bay (he doesn't want to marry her) he makes believe he's already married (he thinks this is an honorable thing to do!). The picture moves along nicely until the cat is let out of the bag, then it goes flat. ""How dare he make love to me and not be married,"" Bergman cries, and with that the picture gets boring."
5,second collaboration of grant and berman wonderful,"one of the most romantic movies ever, and not just in a chick flick way, but the old fashion style of romance. the chemistry between grant and bergman is superb, no less than their first encounter in hitchcock's Notorious. love this movie."
4,Great Romantic Comedie,"Ingrid Bergman shines and Cary Grant is his usual handsome devilish self (think An Affair to Remember) in this romanitc comedy about a man who only pretends to be married to get the girl. Grant is charming, and Ingrid Berman, as a woman who tries not to fall in love but can't help but, is great. Although the movie starts out on the premise that the whole relationship is a scam, don't worry, there is througouhly satisfying ending.This movie was thoroughly enjoyable to watch, and is comparable to the best romantic comedies of today. Definitely a movie to see!"
2,Warning - watch out for this one!,"This is a great film. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman really click and it's a shame they only made two films together. However, I can't recommend buying this particular VHS release of Indiscreet. Hello! - it's recorded in the EP (SLP) mode and also letterboxed and a lot of quality is lost - very blurry. Strange that the other films in the Cary Grant Collection released by Republic are recorded in standard SP, digitally remastered and all that. This one is strictly for the bargain bin at K-Mart."
2,Durable?,"I loved this sander to death. Until it died. Apparently the lower bearing isn't so well sealed and dust will wick the lubrication out of it causing burnout and failure. Its a common enough problem that its in their FAQ. Their solution is to blow it out periodically, but I already did this as a matter of course (and it assumes you happen to have a compressor just to do maintainence) and mine still died a highly premature death. Also, not very well documented is the fact that using it on drywall voids the warranty. I did, albeit very minimally so aparently I'm on my own for the reapir, which runs at least half the cost of the tool, unless you can find someone to sell you the bearing without doing the repair. Thus far I've had no luck.I have to say, I'm disappointed. I consider this to be a design flaw and now I'm in a position of having to by another PC with the same risk of failure or toss the dust collection kit ... that won't fit on other brands."
3,"Excellent sander, poor dust collection","I have owned this sander for 4 years. Plenty of power so if that is high on your list choose this sander. However, if dust is a concern read on. On my second project, the dust collection canister flew off and would have continued to fly off. This is definetly a design flaw. I remedied this by wrapping a piece of 1/2"" wide duct tape around the flange that the plastic canister fits over. It makes a tighter fit but does need replaing from time to time. PC has installed a little plastic disk similar to a check valve inside the tube going to the canister to keep the dust in the canister from going back onto your work. Well everytime I would use it, when I would go to remove the dust, the little disk would be laying inside the canister so this feature does not work. Remedy, wear a dust mask and attach to vac if you are attempting to keep your shop relatively clean."
5,So far so good,"I do finish work for a living. 99.999% of everything I do is new. So it doesn't stip layers of paint, or stain and lacquer. But when it comes to sanding woods or fillers it is a hawg. When you're working in a house and dust is floating in the air, any dust collection is better than nothing. With cannister off, a dust cloud is very evident. It is made in the USA, cheaper than competitors, and so far held up to the jobsite. It is quiter than both 1/3, and 1/4 sheet sanders I have. When I first used one, I was impressed on how effortless it was to sand with it."
2,Porter Cable used to mean Quality Tools,"333 Orbital sander lower bearing is mounted in plastic,I have replaced lower houseing and all new bearings.The lower bearing bore melts and the sander is juke again.BUY BOSCH."
5,Awesome!,"Passport to Purity is awesome. I have 3 daughters and have had the opportunity to do this with 2 of them so far.. You should make this a priority in your family. My girls and I had a great time and Dennis and Barbara Rainey took the pressure off me because they explained ""it"" to them. There was lots of laughing and some blushing going on this weekend but it was an awesome time to share what my husband and I want for our girls and they were accepting of it all! Thanks Barbara and Dennis Rainey, there is a special place in heaven for you!!"
5,amazing,"I went on this trip with my mom a little over a year ago and WOW! What an impact! We had many talks, and grew closer. It wasn't in the least embarrassing, and I could easily sign the Wait-to-Date Contract at the end. I loved that weekend and would recommend it to anyone."
4,Great experience,"I had the opportunity to use this material many years ago with my older daughters. I only wish that there was more follow up material as they go on through the teen years as a reminder, like another getaway or two. One daughter entered marriage sex free, the other one decided not to wait, even with all the training and talks. I still love the material and will be using it for my two younger children, one this year."
2,Not so conservative...,"My daughter and I recently went on a Mother/Daughter weekend, and we used some of the material from this weekend kit. In my opinion, it focuses more on the 'typical teen dating scenario', and less on God's beautiful plan for marriage in the future. I would highly recommend listening to all the sessions and reading through the student's journal before using this material. There were some things that we did not discuss as we do not believe in 'teen dating', and therefore, have trained our children to not view this behavior as normal from a biblical perspective. So, use caution, if purchasing, but know that there are some nuggets that can be used for a wonderful weekend."
4,The End Times ROCK,"Saviour Machine Legend I and II are in my top 15 albums of all time. I absolutely love most of their music and have used their cds as a witness tool for countless youth that appreciate great in your face music and lyrics. With that said,I believe Legend III-I was a little bit of a letdown compared to the 1st releases in this trilogy. Lyrics were great, wonderful music, but I felt the production was a bit off. In NO WAY should my review keep anyone from supporting this great cd though. Its to bad Eric hasnt been able to complete the trilogy in the last 11 years.I cant speak for the other fans, but I kind of feel cheated that its taken so long to finish.....Support your favorite artists......."
4,Love it!,"I stopped off to get this little guy in a Best Buy while on a road trip last week. It was super cheap (less than $20) and worked great for the price. It was super easy to set up and take down on the run. Perfect for the tiny space we had left in the car. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the little crank to raise and lower the center adjustment column sometimes slid if any pressure was put on it (more than just the camera), but it didn't affect the pictures we took with it. Although it was tiny, I wasn't able to get it in my suite case for the return trip on the airplane. But I would buy this little sucker again for sure!"
3,Not one of Mallon's better novels,"""Two Moons"" is not as good as the two other Thomas Maloon books I have read: ""Henry and Clara"" and ""Watergate"". It adds little to the reader's historical understanding. Still, Mallon is a very competent writer, and there is enough plot to keep the reader's attention. Cynthia has chosen the wrong man, but her infatuation blossoms into ""true"" love, and it is easy to see how that love could have sustained her through an otherwise troubled marriage - had things worked out differently. Cynthia is resilient enough that I wonder why she did not seek a job as a computer in the Almanac Office (full name, according to Wikipedia, was the American Nautical Almanac Office)."
3,Partial eclipse of the Moon,"A brilliant concept bogged down with politics and disease. The novel begins 50 pages too late, and ends 16 pages too late. In between there are many touching moments, a few fascinating ideas, and the immortalising climax which was all too brief to fully capture its power and beauty."
4,A Charming Story,"This is a wonderful, charming little book. It's a romance with a small ""r"". It's not the great American novel and thank God it doesn't even try for that. The last thing we need more of is the bloated over-weight fudge we keep getting from Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer.The characters are well-drawn and believable, unlike several of the characters in Mallon's previous novel, ""Dewey Defeats Truman"". You will care about them and you will understand why they do what they do. As always, Mallon's ability to evoke a time and place is unmatched. His aim is dead on. I'm no expert in Washington, D.C. in any century, but the depiction of the capital in 1877 worked for me and I didn't find any major anachronisms. The astronomical and astrological themes are skillfully woven into the story and provide a good deal of interest. Finally, anyone who truly has been in love will find that the story of Cynthia May and Hugh Allison will strike a resounding chord in your heart."
3,The moon and a sixpence,"Although the subjects dealt with here are fascinating -- D.C. in the late 19th century, malaria in Foggy Bottom, the discovery of moons around Mars -- the novel just isn't all that involving. The strongest, most interesting character is Roscoe Conkling, the New York senator and king of the Republican Custom House machine. The made-up ones -- a widow with a flair for numbers and a self-destructive, Harvard-educated astronomer -- don't propel you through the plot. Lots of great period detail, and the ultimate tragedy of the tale will give you pause."
1,Waste of money,I was very disappointed when I found mathematical errors in the contents of this book. The explanations were at best simplistic and so were the exercises. The real GRE is way harder than what this book offers as examples of the test.
1,Third Rate Text,"This disappointing book has a fair amount of review material, but much of it does not closely resemble the GRE. For example, the mathematics questions stress simple geometry (i.e. 3-4-5 triangles) while GRE mathematics questions are rather more dense. Some figures are even mislabeled. Reading comprehension paragraphs contain typographical errors. These problems result in an unpolished product.Kaplan boasts 12 section-length practice tests, but these tests share a question-pool, so students can run into the same question in Quantitative practice test 3 that they saw in test 1. In fact, one question on full length CAT is exactly the same as an ETS Powerprep Quantitative Comparison question (it involves the area of a parallelogram).The savvy student will purchase an ETS published book. By the way, the back cover of Kaplan's book includes the text: ""Are you ready for the GRE Exam."" That asks ""Are you ready for the Graduate Record Exam Exam."" Better rethink your editorial staff, Kaplan."
2,"Looks nice, but...","I would prefer something a little (a lot, really) more sturdy. While in my travel bag, the top of the case dented in, and now it will not close properly. Instead of ""Survivor"", I would dub this ""Elegant, but Fragile, Facade""."
1,horrible movie,"Movie was horrible. Don't understand how Tony Rock could participate in such a wack film. It was like a biography. Tony Rock was a horrible comedian. I met him a couple of years ago and he was a cool person. I wish I knew him when this movie came out because I would tell him ""C'mon Man! lol Get it? Try again. *Drops mic. In my Kanye voice ""Next""! lol"
1,Waste of time and money,A prepared-to-order booklet of 47 pp.So many errors and typos!The General Books website is no help in deciphering or abating this mess.
2,poor quality,"Due to the poor quality of the print on demand technology,this volume contained so many errors as to be almost unreadable."
4,Gangleader Nicky By Nicky Cruz,The book made and big impression on me. Because of it was his own story and it was a hart lift he was living on the street.
2,Confusing,"As I started to read this book the introduction seemed to be a conclusion summing up all the chapters to come. Entering into the first chapter left me frustrated because it also cited from the other chapters. I feel that I should be reading this book backwards, perhaps then I wouldn't be so confused. Perhaps if you can get through the first part of this book it gets better, good luck."
4,good noise,"if you like dissonance, noise, and minnimalist drone, then this album is sure to be for you. That about sums it up. Also, a good ""historical document"" for any rabid fans/ maniacal collectors out there. Persons who want mellody with their music should look elsewhere, like to the Sabotage album."
3,Just a friendly warning..take it for what's it's worth,"It was my mistake. I really admit that. When I read ""no sugar"" I made the mistake of actually thinking ""no sugar."" I forgot about the use of artificial sweeteners, which, of course, I cannot tolerate. So many of these recipes will not work for me. I also question the use of mixes in some of the recipes as many of these contain MSG, which is also not good for a person following a low-carb plan. Nevertheless I applaud Ms. Schweinhart's efforts."
3,Where is the mystery?,"I really wanted to like this book, but I found it hard to get through. The villains are identified early in the book, so the mystery element disappears. The characters are all so serious that there is no humor. I realize it is not a comedy, but a light moment here or there would make the characters seem human. What an unbelievably dreary collection of people. The technical elements seem to be correct if that is what you are looking for."
2,"Light Action, Light Thrills - No real ""chase""","I found the book to move rather slowly most of the time, with small spurts of action and confrontations mixed in to keep readers awake. Premise of the story is good, but the novel drags on and the finale is short and unexciting compared to other books in the genre.I did learn a little about art, and the locales were OK, but these facets were not enough to overcome the mostly drab storyline and weak characterization.I usually finish books I start unless they are altogether terrible, and this one was certainly palatable, but not one I would recommend to action or thriller-oriented readers.Jim"
2,Art History Mystery,Thomas Swan's previous books are great. I had a very hard time trying to stay interested in this one. It was all over the place.
4,Great book for beginners in Serbo-Croat,"This is a good first step for a beginner wanting to learn more Serbo-Croat than you'd find in a ""phrasebook for travellers"". The complicated grammatical structure is attacked in a very simple, approachable way. The book contains enough vocabulary for a wide variety of situations.It would be impossible, I think, for a text like this to give equal consideration to all the varieties of Serbo-Croat. Much better to learn one dialect, as it's not too difficult to switch to another. This book teaches a Croatian dialect, and this is clearly explained at the beginning. I wanted to learn Bosnian, but this book was more than adequate for learning the rudiments of the language, despite the focus on a different dialect.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to start learning any dialect of Serbo-Croat. Having worked my way through it, I hope the author decides to write an ""advanced Serbo-Croat"" book to follow on from this one."
3,"please discuss the book first, without primitive nationalism","I am a bosnian of mixed ethnic origin and I feel quite offended by people who choose such a ridiculous and narrow-minded approach instead of discussing the book and its merits. considering the scarcity of books for learning this fairly exotic language in any of its varieties, this one does a fair job as far as colloquial language is concerned, yet if you learn serbo-croatian in order to read authors like krleza or andric, it won't do. oh yes-ask the reader below to translate anything from english into his native tongue in order to read it to bosnians or serbians or montenegrins. if you pay him enough, you'll see him changing his mind about the language in lightspeed and claiming how we all understand each other."
1,"Not Serbo-Croat, this is Croatian","The book is completely about Croatian language (dialect), with a small exception in cyrilic alphabet. This book cannot be used in the eastern parts of former Yugoslavia, it can make one even more confused about languages and dialects spoken in Yugoslavia. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of gramatical explanations and exercises. It would be good and fair to present the correct title of the book, that is: ""Teach yourself: CROATIAN"""
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"If your a beginner this is not the tape for you. In fact you would have to be pretty advanced to figure out what they are doing. There is no instruction. Just good music and people dancing. Everyonce in awhile the camera will have a close up of someones feet. If you know what your doing and just want some extra steps, maybe this is for you. But my guess is you already know these moves if you can understand this tape. Not worth the money and certainly not worth the shipping charges."
4,great video,"It is true that the dancing is a little stiff and robotlike, but the instruction is very good. I also like the way they let you be able to practice a dance to the right music and for a long time."
4,Works well,Hey just a quick note to say that this works awesome with the advantage tool. I only used it for drywall cutouts but it snaps off and on very quickly with a quick modification to the depth of the tool. The only real drawback seems to be the measurement settings on the tool. They are vague at best if you want to cut out a hole of an exact diameter. I just used my tape for setup and went with that instead of using the built in measurements.
2,Not a precise circle cutter,"I bought this for my Dremel to cut circles for carved wooden hand mirrors. I need precise circles of the proper diameter and they have to be round. there's a lot of slop in the connection to the Dremel, and as you follow around the circle, the Dremel can move laterally in the fixture. The result is an uneven circle. It could be good enough for drywall work, but not for routing good cricles in wood."
2,Not what I expected,"Inside the Registry did have a few tips, but the main focus was NOT to using the Registry. The author used Win95 desktop when ever possible to make changes. After browsing the book, I would say that the MS Resource book provided the same information."
2,"For end-users, not developers","The blurb on the back cover claims that this book is for ""application developers, system administrators and even power users"" but the claims would be better stated the other way round. This is a book written by an end-user, not a Microsoft insider, and is primarily concerned with explaining Shell features of the registry that the author has ""discovered"". It is reasonably well organised but reads like a compendium of the tips and tricks columns that one sees in popular magazines - how to customise icons, context menus, the desktop, etc.If you are an end-user and want a consolidated source of this sort of information this book may be for you. If you are a developer who wants to understand the logical structure of the registry and the conventions for storing your own data in it then look elsewhere."
3,Not for the serious developer,"As mentioned in other reviews, this book is not for the serious developer. It is for an end-user. For developers I would recommend the book ""Inside the Windows 95 Registry"" by Ron Petrusha, published by O'Reilly and Associates."
2,Es una buena introducción de lo que es el Registry,"Es un buen trabajo, pero es muy básico y especialmente a mí me ha dejado sabor a poco. Particularmente yo necesitaba algo más técnico y profundo."
4,RECOMMENDATION OF BOOK ON THE LIFE OF TESLA,"THIS BOOK GIVES A VERY GOOD INSIGHT INTO THE GENIUS OF TESLA-PITY ""BIG BUSINESS"" DENIED MANKIND OF HIS AMAZING INVENTIONS WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BENEFITED ALL OF US!!!!I RECOMMEND ALL SHOULD READ THIS INVALUABLE BOOK"
5,Amp'd - Amazing,"I'll be honest-I bought Amp'd solely to learn more about the roots of the band Breaking Benjamin, and member Aaron Fink. What I received, however, was much more. Gary Fincke delivers a captivating, suspenseful, and beautifully written story in Amp'd. Spanning from Aaron's high school band to 2003 Breaking Benjamin, Professor Fincke recounts his son's transformation as a musician and human being. Amp'd is filled with anecdotes that are sure to make you chuckle, and in some cases, experience a strangely authentic fearful sensation. Even though I am an avid Breaking Benjamin fan, Aaron's success did not seem assured throughout the story; I had serious trouble putting the book down.To summarize, Amp'd is a powerful account of Aaron Fink's rise to stardom. Its captivating narrative is sure to engage any reader-fan of Breaking Benjamin or not. 5/5 for an amazing work of literature."
5,Very nice,"I have the place settings, but had been unable to find the hostess sets. I love this silverware, it has a nice heavy weight to it, and washes in the dishwasher very well. Would definitely purchase again. Also arrived very quickly"
4,Worth the purchase,"I wasn't impressed when I first read it, I thought the content was generic and common sense, plus the odd spacing another reviewer had mentioned makes it feel unprofessionally done (I knocked off a star for its presentation)I went back to read it again the other day and to my surprise, this book was a good reminder to parents on how to love their children for the very essence of who they are and not what the report card says who they are. This book serves as a great tool for PARENTS to stay motivated in encouraging their children and standing behind them. It is an easy read and puts the world of 'grades' in right perspective."
3,It was okay,"I got this book when it was free, so I'm still glad I read it. If I had to buy it, guess I would have been a little disappointed. Still it was not too bad."
3,Student Review,I chose to read RAT because the cover has a basketball on it and I like to play basketball. I was happy with the decision to spend my time reading this work.This was not wwhat I expected and I was thrilled with this discovery. The book kept me interested because it's not only about basketball but about a rape and other things like that. That's why I was interested. I did not learn anything new but it was not boring and was basically entertaining and fun to read. There was not anything unique about this book becuase it's something that could actually happen in real life.I recommend this book to everyone that is into drama and it would benefit all gym teachers across the world.
3,A difficult read,"I have read this in English and Hungarian both and find it quite dry either way. The translation is fine, but Móricz has an unfailing knack for putting me to sleep. I really want to enjoy this novel, bearing in mind its stature and popular esteem, but I can't seem to.I find the hero, Misi Nyilas, too hard to relate to. He is weak, wishy-washy, and indecisive and seems to have no good traits to offset these. He's frustrating and while reading the story I often have an urge to shake him. The plot is näive and unsurprising, and the ending is a perplexing muddle which seems to offer no hope or even resolution. Móricz is traditionally praised for being grim and unyieldingly realistic but in a novel of this length he becomes overbearingly bleak.Read this if you have an unrelenting interest in Hungarian literature--and only after reading Kosztolányi's novels and Móricz's short stories, which are much sharper."
4,Review by Chiprocks,"I just watched the world premiere of Breaking Vegas on the history channel. All I can say to you who have not seen this, is that you will find yourself entralled by the story. For years I have been hearing about the M.I.T. Kids and how they got away with there methods in outsmarting the casinos. Well.....got away with it until greed within there own group and poor managment brought about their demise. It was just a hoot to finally hear about the true story about the legend. I for one, even though I taped it off of the History Channel, will buy the DVD when it comes out."
3,Possibly enthralling story marred by uninteresting storytell,"How could you possibly mess up a story about Las Vegas and a group of kids who took casinos for millions? Well, you can't...almost. Some of the acting in the recreations here are almost laughably bad...a ""Rain Man""-esque professor with annoyingly overplayed mannerisms, random stares into the camera for (what I thought was supposed to be) dramatic pauses, other annoyances like that. The writing is bland and the voice over is done by someone who sounds as young as Ryan Seacrest (read: no dramatic undertones).But don't get me wrong, the story is still interesting, and it's just interesting enough to make you forget about the annoyances above."
1,Wrong choice,"Unfortunately I chose the wrong DVD, I wanted the actual movie. Needless to sy that I am disappointed. This DVD is like a documentary I have already seen on the history channel."
4,"Good overall, some drawbacks","I have owned this product for over 2 years now and am glad I purchased it. It helps to have music when biking long distances. My biggest concern with this product is that it chews through batteries pretty quickly. My other concern is that the radio stations come in pretty solidly in cities, but not so much when in the country. There is a switch on the bottom of the unit that does boost the signal if you're not right in a city, but it's sometimes not that strong. That said, I'm pretty satisfied with this product overall."
4,best out there could be better,"I have used this radio for the last 2 years, mostly in heavy salt environmentbeach/marina and plenty of Florida rain... still works the same as new.The digital tuning great, no drift. digital speedomter/odometer accepts 700size for calibration and is remarkably accurate.Quick release is a dream, secure but easy to release.The sound on this unit is not very good in terms of volume.It's very clear with new batteries but not loud enough when background noisesare present.I am constantly adjusting the sensor/magnet alignment(a minorinconvenience compared to usefullnes of features)This unit could be alot louder. It could also use some upgrades likeearphone/ext.spkr. jack and ext.antenna option for remote use.I am writing this review 2 years lateer because i'm actually purchasing anotherone!"
4,Quite nice,"PROs: Good radio, easily removable for nice portable radioCons: Minorwire was a bit short for my Downtube folder, which needs a long reach due to its small frontwheel (29"" base to sensor) has bar mounts which will need spacers and speedo/odo not as easy to use as dedicated units.All and all it is nice and very well made."
3,engaging yet condescending,"Kenneth Davis' book's question/answer style format makes this book easy to read and very informative. Unfortunately, many of his enteries do not readily answer the questions he poses and, what's more, he leaves the reader feeling talked down to. This book has its purpose though: I found the format and the concise entries useful when touring civil war sites. But, if you want to know everything you ""need to know about America's greatest conflict,"" you won't get it here. It's a good starter book to introduce the topic, but from here, McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom of Foote's trilogy on the Civil War are much needed."
3,Entertaining and Informative,"This book was an easy and captivating read. However, I felt that the author used a bit too much of his energy trying to convince the reader that slavery was wrong. WHO is he trying to convince? People who think that slavery is a good idea certainly do not have the mental capacity to read comics, let alone a book, so I felt that my intelligence was a bit slighted. It WAS a bit interesting to see how many synonyms for HORRIBLE that he could come up with. Overall, I did learn many things that I had never known, especially about slavery and pre-war America, so I would recommend this book. I find that there are many things that I didn't learn in school, and I suspect it's the same for alot of people, so Mr. Davis's books are a great (and welcome) idea! I just hope that people read more than this one book (ANY one book) before they decide that they DO know something about the Civil War."
1,"An abject, unmitigated disaster.","This book is so full of egregious factual blunders (e.g., ""Arkansas [was] a slaveholding state that remained in the Union"") as to be totally worthless. It is also replete with simplistic and just plain wrong interpretations. The only positive thing to be said about this bomb is that the title is a true reflection of the author's level of knowledge of the subject. One star it too many, but there was no lower number for me to choose."
1,Still don't know much......,"5 CDs. The first CD is solely about slavery. The second CD is more of the same. I give up.I was hoping, as a non-American, for a detailed book on the leaders, battles and armaments of the Civil War.Instead I get some PC slavery-obsessed poor Blacks terrible us blah blah.If I wanted an audiobook on Slavery I wouldn't have bought one on the Civil War.Sadly this is the kind of self-loathing leftist revisionist history that is brain-washing generations."
5,Great Book,"The book arrived safely and in very good condition. I lost my last copy so was glad to be able to replace it. The price was fantastic, thank you seller. You made a history buff very happy."
3,Concentration wavering reading?!?,"I cannot help but pick up books about the ""War between the States"". As an amateur expert on this war, my take on this book is that it was interesting in parts and boring in others. I thrive on information but not the lengthy version that Davis seems to prefer. Short spurts appear often enough to make the book enjoyable. His information is credible and the first hand accounts that are interspersed thruout are fun. I guess my take is basically, thank god for my speed-reading abilities."
4,Don't Know Much About The Civil War,"Kenneth C. Davis has done a remarkable job of making asometimes dull and often hard to follow subject as the Civil Warinteresting and down to earth. Fancying myself a history buff Ithought I knew most of what I wanted to know about this periodin our nations great history, but the author brought out manyfasinating facts about individual players involved in this conflict that I had not known. Even my wife and nine-year-old daughter have spent many hours absorbed in these stories of bravery, cowardice, leadership, hatred, and sometimes stupidity. In fact we are currently on our second set of audio tapes because the first wore out from the repeated use.History buff or history dope ""Don't Know Much About The Civil War"" will give you an exciting look at a subject that for most hasn't always been that exciting."
4,A great way to pass the time on those long drives.....,"My husband and I recently returned from our honeymoon touring Civil War Battlefields. This tape provided us with 6 hours of listening pleasure. Although we are well versed in all aspects of the Civil War, this was still an enjoyable way to spend our day in the car. Questions are asked, then answers provided in detail by the reader. A bit patronizing at times (Are we really that lost, to have to be asked ""Who was Abraham Lincoln?"") but still wonderful information nonetheless about pre-war conflicts and the events leading up to our nations greatest struggle. The language and stories are clear and presented in a way that all ages should benefit. If you are going to listen to an audiobook, why not make it a learning experience as well?"
1,Insufferable,"I give this one star only because the site won't let me give it zero.After agonizing through the first hundred pages of this book just to see if it got any better (it didn't) I was so disgusted with his tiresome prose and graphic accounts of slave beatings that I literally threw the book in the trash. Slavery was wrong, Mr. Davis, we get it, now get on with what we are to learn that we supposedly never did. My conscience got the best of me regarding tossing the book, though, since I have a certain reverence for books (even bad ones) so I fished it out of the trash and put it on the exchange table at work in case some masochist feels compelled to delve into it in its entirety. I bought it at Goodwill for $1.50; I see why it got sent to Goodwill. It's not one to keep in a collection. In fact, if we were still using Sears & Roebuck catalogs in outhouses....."
1,don't know much.. and he wants to keep it that way,politically correct revisionist pap...i made it thru the first hour of the tape then pitched it. i have read several treatments of this sad event; this is the only one i pitched out..literally...
1,WEAK NORTHEREN VIEW OF WAR,Agree with another reviewer Jesse Jackson had to be the author of the first part of book. Was there any one in the South that wasnt hateful? A high % of Northern soldiers were not fighting to free the negro and a even higher number of southern soldiers did not own slaves. Know wonder we still have problems if they read this.
4,Don't know mcuh about the civil war,"I was looking for verification of facts, like who was behind Lincoln's assassination, but this work didn't satisfy that curiosity, yet I learned much, since I didn't do American history in school."
1,WORTHLESS,"If the world ran out of toilet paper I still would not recommend this book. A more appropriate title would be ""The Civil War for mindless simpletons who are too lazy to read a real history book."""
3,just a history book,I thought I would learn more secrets from this book but I was a little disappointed.If you are looking for exotic opinions or comments about how and why things went the way it was you do not find much in this book. Dispersed into book are some memories from people involved at every walks of life which makes book a little more interesting than others. In every chapter there is a chronology of events that took place and laws that congress passed. Still looking for a better book that provides commentary rather than chronology of events.
3,Fails to Prove its Thesis,"When I was in high school, we were assigned to write a paper on the causes of the Civil War. I think of the 30 people in my class, 29 wrote their papers on slavery; I wrote mine on state's rights. I focussed on the threats to the Union encountered by Andrew Jackson. When this book began with the thesis that the Civil War was caused primarily and perhaps exclusively by slavery, I was willing to let the author make his case. After completing the book, I am not convinced. The South was vanquished, slavery abolished, and 140 years later the South is still almost diametrically opposed politically to the North. Look at the results of the last two presidencial elections. Slavery is gone and all of the state's rights issues are still there. The South is as anti-Federal now as they were before the Civil War. It was this difference in basic philosophy that led to the war, slavery made the differences more noticeable."
2,Don't Know Much About the Civil War,"Don't know much about the Civil War reminds me of a Berkley professor brain washing it's students with extremist positions. Why does Mr. Davis take a subjective leftist view on this era? You only have to read any of his other books to know why. He is extremely liberal. If you are fresh out of a large University, you'll love this book. If you are tired of the rhetoric of the left you will find yourself somewhat repulsed. Not by the content, but by the strong negative tone inflections Davis places on America and its history. A history lesson, whether taught to you or your kids, must be objective facts, not a persuasive pitch of your own personal hatred. Davis sell book based on this premise."
2,Seems to contain a bit of bias,"After finding ancestors who served on the Union side of the Civil War, I've been reading everything I can find on the subject. I have found old newspaper archives to be the greatest source of information. This is the first book I've come across that seems to paint the Civil War in a 21st century light. Yes, there is some good basic Civil War information but the author seems to include a bit of bias that flies in the face of the many articles I've read. One third of the way through the book and I'm done with it. I give it two stars for painting slavery as the evil as it truly was. The rest really ought to be taken with a grain of salt."
4,"an enjoyable, quick one-sitting read","It's a very sweet, cute story about falling in love with your best friend's older brother from Jenna's perspective, or your little sister's best friend from Spence's perspective. From the product description and reviews I've read, I expected to be very chauvinistic and read like an infertility guidebpook or a sex manual, but it wasn't like that at all. What moved me was the genuine affection and respect they showed each other as this conflict played itself out. And they taught each other valuable and much-needed lessons about life. Spence learned to settle down and life isn't all about ambitious adventures, and Jenna learned to let fun and love in and that life isn't all about business."
3,A bad premise from a good writer.,"When Jenna McCue decided to have a baby, she needed a sperm donor. Her best friend's brother seemed perfect. Spencer Smith was handsome, intelligent, and rarely in town. He agreed to be the donor, with one change. Spencer would give his sperm the old-fashioned way, through sex. Suddenly, a business deal to have a baby becomes very personal.The coldbloodedness of the premise made it hard to get into the story. Spencer is immature and Jenna is a bit self-absorbed. If this was any other genre, that characterization would be acceptable. In a romance, it's important that your hero and heroine are likeable or become so during the course of the story."
3,Good introduction,"There was a lot of blues around at the time of the beat boom but by the time Canned Heat emerged it had mostly become supercharged by Cream and Hendrix, psychedelicised by the likes of Jefferson Airplane or bludgeoned into submission by high-volume bands like Blue Cheer. Consequently, they sounded slightly dated and overly purist at the time, especially since their music harked back to the more acoustic, less fashionable blues of Henry Thomas, Cleveland Crotchet and the Memphis Jug Band, to name just a few covered on this collection.I only knew their singles, so was pleasantly surprised to discover the longer, more experimental pieces like the twenty-minute Parthenogenesis and the live favourite Fried Hockey Boogie. Furthermore, they now sound a lot less dated than many of their contemporaries, due to the sincerity and integrity of their approach to the blues"
4,A fine edition.,"The Doctrine of Fascism is an important text in understanding Italian Fascism, its basic principles and the ideas that re-shaped the world, for better or for worse, between the first and the second World War.This edition, although seemingly fairly accurate and true to the original text, has a number of typos. Nothing serious enough to reduce the overall quality of the edition though.I highly recommend this text for anyone interested in understanding Fascism."
2,Disappointing coverage of a political belief,"This book is composed of short excerpts from Mussolini's speeches. He apparently had no particular philosophy other than action. This book reflects his lack of ideas. However, he was one of the most popular politicians of his day, which speaks much about the those times when Communism was seen as the hope of the world."
1,broke the same day,do not purchase this product. It broke the first day. the plastic wrist band is very fragile.
1,Literally fell apart,"This watch was so cheap, that the wristband literally fell off the watch when I took it out of the package. It was only a couple bucks, but still! My daughter was not impressed, and neither was I."
2,"Nice, but offers very little value","This is probably one of the best books in terms of style and ease of language used. I read the entire book in less than 2 hours, but I do not think it added any value.The whole book is just re-iteration of common sense and it will not tell you anything you do not already know. It simply brings it all in a few pages written in simple plain English.If you need some inspiration, get this book. If you need to learn something new, then don't because it can not offer you that."
1,only for folks in advertising,"I have no knowledge of the advertising business and no interest in learning how to get ahead in that world. You wouldn't know from the book's cover that the author's experience and advice are narrowly limited to that field. As an outsider, I could not understand some of the terminology and concepts. That is in part because of the industry niche, and also because of the British vocabulary (Persil Automatic?).There's certainly value in motivational books like this, to get you all fired up when you need inspiration. It's just that this one will only be helpful to those in advertising, and specifically folks who work in small ad agencies and understand that language and culture. Outside of that narrow culture, many of the recommendations would prove disastrous indeed to one's career."
5,Everyone home should have a copy,"When I taught an advertising class at university I put this book at the top of the required reading list. Most of the kids couldn't understand why a tiny little book like this was so important. Until they read it.Most of those kids, like me, now keep a copy of this book on their desk, because within its small, perfectly formed pages, lie more inspirational ideas than any book I have ever read. Seriously."
4,pocket pep for ad kids,"This is like a snapshot of the ad industry that is enlightening to outsiders and humorous (and relevant) to insiders. Paul Arden is an industry legend and this mini-book reads like a memoir the author's been writing on napkins and scrap paper for the last 30 years. There's a little bit of everything in here: jokes, observations, actual guidance, tips, lessons learned. As with the ad industry itself - which typically functions as a sarcastic, slightly macabre mirror of reality - take in this work with a sense of humor and an eye out for the real message. There's some good stuff in here."
1,Waste of paper,"I bought this book expecting to learn something. Instead, its a random collection of thoughts which just about anyone who had been in business for a few years could write.Most distressing to me of all is most of the book is about how to be successful in advertising and this is not stated on the cover or back. The book didn't really inspire me, and the content seemed pretty disconnected from the actual content itself.Not recommended to buy at all."
3,Good light reading,"I was expecting more thought provoking quotes, stories or questions to challenge me. Instead, this book was more of a light reading table book."
5,It is what it is.....,"To all of those readers who are incredibly unsatisfied with this book: LIGHTEN UP!!!! This book is what it is and to hold such high expectations to the point of letting it ruin your day is absolutely missing the point of the author's message. Paul Arden is simply providing his insight in small passages and if that approach works for the reader all is well but if it does not: ""stop, drop and roll""! Simply put this is a great and easy read that accomplishes it's goal: to make us think!"
3,"This book a case of ""style over substance""","Is this book a case of ""style over substance""?The promise of the book is ""to use the creative processes of good advertising as a metaphor for business practice"".What you get is a nice collection of observations on business and life. Beautifully presented thanks to the efforts of Roger Kennedy but I'm afraid this book is a case of style over substance.The advice despite the creative angle is not particularly original or inspirational. If you happen across a copy at a modest price by all means get it but if you are looking at a book shelf (virtual or real) chances are there will be a better book on the topic to the left or right"
1,What drivel,"Yes it has some cute quotables and no doubt some value to a dim-witted 8th-grader looking for success. It could not have taken Paul Arden more than 15 minutes of thought to put together such a waste of paper.My firm sent this out to all senior management - it's on a par with that other tome - ""Who moved my cheese"".It's simple pop-psychology for the masses - keep clear... if it were free and printed on toilet paper you might want to consider using it - if you know what I mean."
3,the transition album,"spirit of the dance is worth it alone. It has kind of has ahoedown vibe to it. It is a transition between the dence progfeel of the first two, and the more pop-prog feel of time andtide. all-in-all, it's worth the time"
1,Terrible.,Provides no help whatsoever.You would find much better guides and walkthroughs on gamefaqs.
2,Sub-par anime. Rent it instead.,"I made the mistake of buying this video at a show, where the maker (a company that has a history of making lousy translations and worst dubbings) was heavily promoting it. The video was interesting for first ten minutes, then it fast deteriorates into predictable cliches, lousy story, poor character developments, and even poorer dubbing. If not for the extended nudity scenes (which I like very much), I would probably give it one star. Too bad, because the first ten minutes showed a lot of promise. Also, the video is too short, and they are charging way to much for it. If you like naked Chinese women, rent it. Otherwise, check out Ninja Scrolls or Demon City."
4,Crimson wolf,"This was an OKAY video, i wouldn't say it was one of the most exciting things i have ever seen. It seems to me more of a get the girl naked situation however it did have an okay plot. The plot was a little mixed up and teh end didn't even seem to fit with the rest of it. The art was good and the voices were okay, it's not somthing i'd recommend you spend your one chance to buy a video on this one, but if you have money to burn it's a pretty okay edition to an existing collection."
2,It's ok,It's a standard anime that is good for watching one time. I did notice something odd about this movie though. Capcom should sue the company that made this because if you look closely in the background of one of the scenes you can clearly see Chun Li standing there. I guess one of the artists thought it would be a funny thing to do.
1,Crimson Wolf,"This is a complete waste of both time and money. It isn't because of the dated method of animation,it is a pathetic and boring attempt at something. I could not finish it and have tossed into a box for disposal."
4,Beautiful to look at as well as to read,"My copy of this book is in my storage unit so it isn't available for me to enjoy at the moment. I bought one of the first editions that has the beautiful artistically designed cover. Just looking at it soothes me and brings me pleasure...gets me ""out of my head"" and into my creative, artistic self. This is a different sort of daily reader, and the format is a nice break from the usual daily meditation books. The drawings inside the book provide a visual soother while the quotes inspire me. It's a great gift idea!"
3,Glynis Has Your Number,"I have read many books on numerology, and when I saw this book on an informercial, thought it would be very insightful. The best part of this book is she describes the attributes associated with various house numbers, otherwise this information can be found in any other book."
5,Finally a complete view of tupac,The most complete and through examination of Tupac's life to date. This DVD examines and details Tupac's life from the cradle to the grave. We are given a first person view of tupac and get to know him thru his words as well as thru the people who were closest to him. This DVD is worth purchasing for the out takes alone which are included in a bonus DVD. Interviews with both Shock G aka Humpty of Digital Underground and Quincy Jones give us an insight in to to tupac's life that has rarely been seen. If you want the true story of who Tupac was then this is a must see. This is the the most complete and detailed DVD on the life of Tupac and it is a must see for anyone from a tupac fanatic to a casual fan of Hip hop music.
5,Thug Angel - Tribute to Tupac,"This DVD is simply amazing, I can honestly say it shows the real Tupac.If you are a Tupac fan, or even are curious about his life, buy this DVD, you wont be dissapointed.RIP Tupac Shakur"
5,So far the best.,This is the best DVD of 2Pac you could get has a lot of footage and clips you see. If you a 2Pac fan get it cause its worth yo money.
4,Pac forever,This docu was a great tribute to a great rapper.Lots of unseen materials.It felt like Pac himself had his hand on the project. It was a bit one sided though.Check out Big Pun Still Not A Player for a reality check into the real world of hip hop.
1,Why The Buzz?,"Why anyone would want to glamorize or idolize this very talented, very savvy, very articulate low-life is beyond me.It reminds me of the phrase: ""The whole world may embrace a purveyor of nonsense, and yet his spewings are still stupidity."""
2,"Motor noise, I'm sending it back",I was very excited when I receive the 450 DV. My expectations where very high because of the right up on the internet. When I tested it out I couldn't beleive that someone would give such a high rating for this. I suppose in a pinch when you need to record something it might be OK. I would not recommend this recorder if you are trying to record with any kind of quality in mind. Beware!
1,worst phone ever,I bought and returned this phone two times. Neither ever worked. As soon as you would enter the number a loud screeching sound would begin and static would cover any conversation. The cord is permanently installed so you can't replace it with a longer one. Not worth the energy to buy it.
3,Works With MagicJack,"I have MagicJack and this phone works great with it. The Caller ID will display the number, date, and time. The date and time automatically sets when you receive your first call. The bad part is once one of the 2 cords goes bad, the phone has to be trashed. There aren't any screws to open this thing up to fix anything, everything is in a plastic mold. GE doesn't make these phones. They are made by Thomson, a company notorious for making junk for RCA"
2,could have been fine...,"I was quite satisfied with this, even though the cords are non-replaceable and the display is not lighted, until I discovered that the batteries (4xAA) even alkalines only last a couple of months and when they die, the phone goes dead too. That's not acceptable, and it makes for a very expensive phone in the long run. I'm returning the one I still can return."
2,Pretty lousy,I've been a big Stan Ridgeway fan for a long time now so i jumped at this vid when i saw it in the store.Have to say i'm very disappointed.Some of the music videos are ok but the video quality overall in this dvd is poor as well as the audio quality.The quality of live stuff is *very poor.Worst of all after watching the home movies of their tour travel i'm disappointed in the group itself as they all come across as whiny jerks.Anyways buy at your own risk.
3,visually compelling but fluff story,"I bought this book since we loved ""K is for Kissing a Cool Kangaroo"". We were a bit disappointed as the story is very short and fluffy. I would not recommend this book for above 2.5 years. This book is not going to teach your little ones about ocean creatures. (Although it is fun to find the sea star on each page.)"
2,Bad book!,"Between my 2 kids, I read a lot of childrens books and I typically don't take the time to review them, but this time I just had to because this book is SO BAD! The illustrations are great, but the rhymes in this are just awful. ""The jellyfish likes to jiggle, which other fish think is quite dumb..."" Why are we name calling in a children's book? A lobster snips your fingers in two?? A swordfish skewers fish?? Come on, what is this?!?! Back to the library with this lousy book. Glad we didn't buy it!"
5,Jem Vol. 1 is the one to buy,"Fun , Exciting ,great songsand excellent story lines make this entire series so appealing great for kids of today and children of the 80s . Kid Rhino is doing an excellent thing by re-releasing these cartoons I look forward to Vol. 2 , Vol. 3 , Vol. 4 , ... etc. I love this video , Jem is my all time favorite cartoon"
5,THE BEST AMERICAN CARTOON OF THE MILLENIUM!,"It's great to see 'ol pink hair back for the new generation kids. I saw it when I was REALLY little, and I'm great to see it's back. The plots are great and exctiting and the little music videos are really awesome!"
4,Jem my favorite 80's cartoon,Jem has always been my favorite cartoon. I love the music and characters. I love the characters because everyone at least know somebody who was like one of the character on the show. Like Stormer who was good person that just got stuck in the wrong crowd. Shana who always their for her friends. Jerrica who is strong independent woman who trying to make it against all odds. Jem is very good cartoon for people to watch. Because we can all learn something from this cartoon. I think the whole family will enjoy. There also a action and adventure and romance so there is a little something for everyone. I think you should give this 80*s cartoon another look.
3,Woohoo!,"This was on after some boys' show (I think it was G.I. Joe or Bionic 9 or something) when I was mad little. I always used to watch it when I thought no one was around. Should bring back some nice memories of one of the many golden ages of limited animation, stupid plots, and droves of near-fanatic fans."
5,Is this a dream come true? It is!!! It is!!! IT IS!!!,"JEM is the diva of the doll-world!!! She was definitely the biggest thing to out-shine Barbie. Unfortunately, her short production lasted for only 2-3 years due to parents concerns with her connections to MTV, wild appearances, sluggish sales at her second year, and (Hasbro's lame excuse) unable to trade fashions with Barbie dolls. I'm definitely excited to see one of my favorite past-time cartoon characters in video again. Unlike many boring cartoons today, JEM is about glamour and glitter, fashion and fame! She is TRULY OUTRAGEOUS! See for yourself. JEM is definitely worth watching!"
5,jem and the holograms vol.1,"jem and the hologram i the best cartoon ever buy far.hopefully one day all eposides will be on video,the movie will be a sucess and it will be on tv."
4,Trail Drive,"After the civil war there were thousands and thousands of wild maverick cattle available in the breaks of Texas available to anyone crazy enough to round them up and drive them to the railheads. In this story McCaleb and his bold-spirited cowboys brave over a 1000 treacherous miles to drive 2400 head of ornery cattle into Wyoming's Sweetwater Valley. With the help of Shoshoni indians and Buffalo Bill Cody, McCaleb and his men, stand and fight to win and call the land their own."
5,Could not be happier,I purchased this serving set to match my silverware... and I could not be happier. They are VERY sturdy and worth the price.
3,nearly perfect but I don't really like rust that much,I have 2 full sets of silverware that are the Gourmet Settings and I love them in every way except for one - they rust. They seem to rust very badly around the little curly Q area on the handle. Some of them are worse than others and some of them have no rust.I'm not sure if anyone will find that helpful or not but that's my experience anyway.
2,A nice collection of every success aphorism you ever heard,"Sharma's book is a thinly veiled litany of pop-success, self-improvement, and leadership aphorisms and clichés which could be collected from any half-dozen other books or seminars. The author possibly intersperses a few bits of original thought between near-plagiaristic repetitions of metaphors. This is all loosely shrouded in the context of dialog between an obvious ignoramous who is supposed to represent the reader on their path of self-discovery of all of this new wisdom, and the saintly gurus who so generously spew it forth. The book is at once amusing and insulting. However, as a collection of good folk wisdom, one could read it as a concise reminder of the way in which we would all like to conduct our lives."
1,Poorly written book with no original content,"If you want to learn about what the author wanted to say, read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective people by Stehpen Covey. 90% of the contents of this book is contained in Covey's book, only in a much more detailed and convincing form. The remaining 10 % you will in find in other pop success books. Stay away from this one, you will find much better success books."
2,Not a book to buy with confidence,"This is not a bok to buy with confidence. The author states at the beginning he is a "" beginner on self discovery...and presently reassessing his most fundamental values...how I view the world."" For me this means in a years time he will write another disregarding much/some of this as his present "" personal transformation is taking place"". What a pity he had not waited and written it when he was more stable and decided.The book is very superficial and contains about 100 things we "" should "" do. AS another critical reviewer noted its just a random collection of wisdom from past books jumbled together which he does not give credit for. Some of it is very good of course. He praises his own previous book in this book of course and promotes the need for a personal coach. In the end the author should have waited until his life was less confusing as he admits at the beginning. Thats the biggest block of all to buying this book. The randomness shows the confusion."
3,The best bit was the Surfer section,"For me, that section held more new insights than the others, which tended to fall into the usual self-help talk. Didn't really like the overall style of writing, it was a bit cloying. But the Surfer section on self-love, abt taking care of yourself with the occasional self-pampering did make me stop and think, which was great!"
5,"If you want to change your life, you can.","I am still reading this book and am only up to the surfer part. So far, I like what he says and he shows the way."
5,very good book,I don't buy a lot of technical books anymore because I can usually find what I need online. But this book is a must-read for java programmers.It clarified a lot of fuzzy general notions in my head of the best ways of doing certain things and how things work in .nET
4,good book,This is a good book and I learned a great dealabout C# and dotnet. I like the way it uses javato explain
4,.NET is cool,"First of all, this is not a book for beginners. There are tons of books out there for beginners and this is not one of them - you must know something about Java.However if your are an experienced Java programmer, then this is the book for you. I have not read the book to the end but it has been really valuable. It breaks down different parts of the .NET framework and shows how things work.It should be noted that most people will get by without knowing a lot of the stuff that is covered in this book but for programmers who are interested in the hows and whys in .NET, this book has to be on your shelf."
3,uneven,"The several different contributors to this book tend to emphasise different aspects of the musicians and their performances, resulting in some highly personal reviews. The quality of writing varies a bit, too. The last word on The Carpenters, for example, reads: ""Karen's solo album was finally released '96, making some fans wonder how long she would have lived if she had been allowed to be herself""; what does this mean, exactly? It's clumsy and ambiguous writing. The book is littered with examples such as this. The editor, Donald Clarke, makes his preferences and prejudices abundantly clear, which is sometimes entertaining but more often irritating. The book as a whole is an uneven blend of reference and personal opinion. It's fun to skim, but I was disappointed."
2,Not what I wanted,The mat looks like at any minute it can break. Everytime that I used it I would get static all over my hair. The description says that it has a soft layer of comfort ... not true. The only good thing about this is that it is easy to clean
4,Exercise mat,I've used this type of mat for 15 years. This one is fine except the corners are square instead of rounded--not a big deal but round would be nicer.
3,Redbook style,"This workout is 45 minutes total, but also broken out into 15 minute segments (1 aerobics, 1 toning, 1 stretching each with its own warmup). It is at a fairly beginning level.The look of the tape totally appeals to the Redbook demographic -- kind of ""plain jane"". Not exactly my style, but if you actually subscribe to that magazine, you may like the look of it. I found it pretty boring compared to other workouts."
3,Jerry Harrison - The Red and The Black LP 1981,"If you like Talking Heads Remain in Light and double live The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, then this 1981 LP on Sire Records USA is great addition to your Talking Heads catalog. Nothing ground breaking but interesting listen to Nona Hendryx vocals and backing for Jerry and Adrian Belew on guitars on most tracks also noteworthy."
4,"Haunting, beautiful, trancelike and just a tad dull","Eleni Karaindrou's music for the films of the great Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos are usually just variations on a theme (and the theme doesn't vary much). For fans of minimalist music her themes for ""Ulysses' Gaze,"" ""Landscape in the Mist"" and ""The Suspended Step of the Stork"" ought to be in your collection. If you want to slip into a meditative state (or sleep) I suggest you turn to any of Karaindrou's soundtracks - you won't be let down. ""The Suspended Step of the Stork"" is a CD for rainy days when you're stuck inside. I imagine that if you set it on repeat you could stare at the rain dribbling down your window for hours. ""The Suspended Step"" is a notch below ""Ulysses' Gaze"" only because it lacks the stunning viola of Kim Kashkashian. However, it's still great music if you're in the right mood. In the end, though, it's perhaps music best heard with Angelopoulos' cinematic accompaniment."
3,"Starts out great, then quickly starts to decline","Installation was risky but simple. The included tools will help you get the battery out and place the new one in. During the first two months, the battery did indeed perform very well giving me 15 hours or more of music. But lately it really has degraded to about 5-6 hours, which is not bad but nowhere close to the 20 hours they advertise. I bought this back in March and now (August) it is not living to my expectations :("
5,Love it!,"Saw her in concert last Feb in London, and was totally amazed by her. I knew (and LOVED) her by Will and Grace... She is a Lady and a great singer, with a great voice and sense of humour. I absolutely recommend this one and the other which is also a pearl."
5,"Megan, let's have drinks","This is on permanent shuffle for me. I was granted the incredible fortune to be introduced to this by a friend. I was never a Will & Grace fan, but she has given a genius collection of eccentric songs an incredible voice and interpretation. Nothing mainstream to see here, folks."
4,big as a berry- best cd ever!,"this cd is shockingly good!! megan mullally has a beautiful voice. i couldnt believe it was her singing, as i have only heard her playing karen walker!! big as a berry is a fabulous album and i definately recommend it 2 any one considering buying it! megan mullally is so talented, its very admirable. cant wait 4 her new talk show!!!"
2,Cannot Believe This is a Professionally Produced CD,"I saw her two years ago on Clay Aiken's Christmas special and I had chills when she sang. I cried. I was speechless. I bought this CD on the basis of that breathtaking performance. But my first thought when it began to play was that I had been sent the wrong CD, that the used-CD seller had inserted in the sleeve an amateur home-made CD by mistake. I winced through much of it and I in no way mean to denigrate or make fun of Ms. Mullally or the musicians but I just did not enjoy the music made here. On slower, sweeter, sadder numbers, her voice evokes emotion from her listeners but on most numbers she sounds raspy and harsh. I blame the choice of music--too offbeat with all over the map arrangements. A gorgeous voice gone wrong. But when she puts out another collection of tunes, I will buy it nonetheless, hoping for the magic I know she has in her!"
2,YIKES!,"Having loved Megan's last CD, ""The Sweetheart Break-In"", I couldn't wait to get my hands on her new ""Big As A Berry"". What a disappointing, frightful, melancholy mess!Mullally is born actress and has an awesome voice. Her last effort was a total original, yet it also recalled Bette Midler's early cabaret/bathhouse days.However, every single song on ""Big As A Berry"" is so down-tempo and depressing, I listened to it twice and had to put it in a box in the cellar. Why the cheery title and bright packaging (so at odds with a repertoire of what sound like bad country tunes) is anybody's guess.The CD is also flatly mixed and badly recorded, with Megan often sounding like she's singing into a tin can.""Big As A Berry"" is very big a waste of talent."
2,From Z to Z,The worst CD I've ever listened to. With a voice as lovely as Megan's she should have chosen her music more carefully. She has a smoky quality to her voice that would lend itself beautiful to forties music and broadway. Don't waste your money.
1,YIKES IS RIGHT,"I saw Megan on David Letterman and thought the song she sang was so beautiful that I ordered the CD before it was released. What a disappointment !!! It sounded to me like it was made in the garage over the weekend and I thought it was a poor selection of songs considering her talent !! Megan, please try again but give me credit for this CD."
1,Do NOT buy this album....,"I saw Megan sing on Letterman and was totally blown away by the beauty of her voice. Silly me, I thought I could expect the same from the entire album. I'm sorry to say, that is not so. I am very disappointed."
3,Surprise...it's Megan..not Karen.,"Well,Ms Mullally certainly shocked me with this cd.The songs are a bit off beat on the whole but her rendition of Danny Boy is excellent.She has a wonderful range to her voice but I dont think most of the songs do her voice justice."
5,Margaret Rocks!,"Never knew Margaret Truman was such a prolific writer and her attention to detail is evident in this book. She did her research in an excellent manner, and wrote the pieces with humor, charm and hopefully, totally correct historical facts. She certainly had a wonderful role model in her mother AND her father who probably had input into her research.Heartily recommend this to any lover of history---it is a book of little known facts about well-known people and makes one feel as if they knew these first ladies in person."
5,Lively History,"A well-written book on the First Ladies, and given the author, we do find many personal anecdotes on the ones of the 20th century. And many of these First Ladies have a wonderful longevity. Ms. Truman is equally funny and vibrant with the First Ladies before the 20th century.How different they all were. One could vaguely divide them into apolitical and political. Margaret's mother would fall into the latter category and of course Eleanor Roosevelt would be at the far end of the fully involved politically.I suppose she seems somewhat overly generous in her evaluation of Jackie Kennedy - but this can be over-looked because of her tormented life. I detected some hostility to Eleanor as I think she stands well above any of the First Ladies. This is definitely an entertaining read from an opinionated author who has a good and personal understanding of the history involved."
1,very poor item,"This item was not as advertised. It was completely the wrong shape. And, getting a refund has been difficult. I was very disappointed in this product."
3,Muscle and want,"A transitional album from the downtempo torture of ""Belief"" to the electro-rock of ""Ebbhead"", ""Showtime"" builds on the relentless machine beats of NE's earlier work while the slick production rounds off NE's legendary hard edge. Although it starts with the much promising, aggressive ""Getting closer"" (one of my favorite NE tracks), this album is a bit tame and laid back. It's truly NE's most accessible and moderate album, but sometimes it becomes rather dull and sounds like Depeche Mode without melody. However, Douglas' best vocal performance ever enlivenes the fiercely minimalistic arrangements and makes the whole affair surprisingly listenable. Other interesting tracks apart from the great ""Getting closer"" are ""My heart"", ""Lightning man"" with its strange oboe refrain, and the single ""Fun to be had"". ""Showtime"" is a good introduction to NE's work for the unexperienced listener, but ""Ebbhead"" offers a greater variety of styles and ""That total age"" is more original and powerful."
3,A decent album at the end of old-school EBM,"""Lightning Man"" is arguably an impressive tune. Because of this song, however, I usually hesitate to play this album. No need to say it's not bad. I think Nitzer Ebb were trying to reconstruct classical Electronic Body Music, which was apparently verging on the end of its span. While succeeding in making some good tunes, NE failed to create a new frontier for EBM, IMO. All NE had revealed with this tune is the fact that Industrial and Jazz (I mean authentic Jazz, not generic Funk) are incompatible with each other. Meanwhile, Ministry showed that Industrial and Thrash Metal are compatible (at least to some people). Later, some acts have shown that Industrial and Techno are also compatible (to some people). Since I like both Industrial and Jazz, I sometimes think about its consequences. After all, a sincere but unsuccessful experiment worth listening to."
4,Strong Rebound,"This was a CD replacement for my cassette. I also have the albums prior to this one (""That Total Age"" & ""Belief""). ""That Total Age"" was a very good industrial album, upbeat strong tracks throughout. ""Belief"" was a bit of a disappointment. The core sound was still there, but something was missing. I'm not one for slow tracks, & this album had more than its fair share. ""Showtime"" rebounds to Nitzer Ebb of old. The 1st track, ""Getting Closer,"" sets the pace. if you are a fan of industrial / industrial dance, I recommend ""Showtime."""
4,An instant classic,"If you want down and dirty 'eine zwei drei vier' industrial, then this may not be the best album to buy.I love this album. This is Nitzer Ebb in the beginning of thier 'Hey let's sell some records' phase."
3,Ebb goes commercial,"Every Ebb fan is going to want to have this, fine. And it's a good add into the collection. BUT They took their uncut unsophisticated AWESOME HARD militant sound and turned it into clubby industrial punk. Enjoy with stale smoke and boredom in goth clubs."
4,NITZER EBB MEETS JAZZ CABARET,"Nitzer Ebb is an essential band that obviously influenced Trent Reznor(NIN). ""Showtime"" is a great album that breaks new ground for the group. They were the ones who brought a jazz sound into the industrial genre. This c.d. features the classic ""Getting Closer"", ""Lightning Man"", and ""Fun to Be Had""...all hardcore dance music. The rest of the album is more experimental in it's rhythms and song structures. Having moved on from the perfect electronic album ""Belief"", this one shows a different attitude. It's sexy and still sounds fresh today. Buy this c.d.!!! ... This band has been shamefully overlooked...give them a chance."
1,This book is why we haven't entered the 21st Century yet.,"I read this book, and I must say that it is thinking like this that is the downfall of our society, both as we know it, as well as how we could know it. It is because of writings such as these that our poet-minded, philosophy-oriented culture has not become more technologically advanced in years of late. I wish that those who would write as well as those who would read this type of literature would spend their time doing something far more productive, like searching for answers to real problems, like disease and space travel, instead of puttering about discussing the imagination's status as a place vs. a space. Come on, people, get real. This book should be banned, with all other books of its kind. If that were to occur, I think our race (as people) could start to get somewhere."
1,Not Laughing! (Did That Get Your Attention?),"Want to write a review on this book? Do it with humor! Want to talk about this book? Do it with humor. Don't think this is funny? Neither do I. That was an example of how the entire book reads. The description of this book led me to believe that I was getting a book like the great ""How to Win Friends & Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie, in that it would delve into the psychology of humor and how to effectively tickle the funny bone. Unfortunately the only thing this book does well is .... Nothing."
1,Waste of time,"This is one of the most useless books I have ever read. I kept reading, hoping that I will learn something from it, to no avail. This book is definitely not worth the time or the money!"
3,Not What I Thought,"This is NOT an autobiography regarding the author's childhood in a log cabin with pioneer parents. Disappointingly, brief facts regarding her childhood account for only about 10% of this book. The vast majority of the book is about how she overcomes her ""backwoods"" upbringing to learn social graces in America and Europe. Its a short read though and you can't beat the price - free (nevertheless, I deleted it from my Kindle because I don't plan on reading it again)."
5,nonstalgia,Got this more for fun since hadn't seen it and years and shared with friends. Was a fun item and sparked conversations about the years that were. Great conversation starter.
2,Boring,"No good ideas in this video. Really disappointed because the show is so great, but the video did not live up to expectations."
1,Save your money.,"Once you get past her extremely long Sensa weight loss ad, which comes on before anything else, this DVD doesn't offer anything new that Patti has always preached on her show and outlined in her book. The production quality is poor and everything is scripted and staged. There are a few good pointers, but overall its not worth spending your money on."
2,More joke than informative,"I've watched Millionaire Matchmaker and enjoy it entertainment value, and I appreciated Patti's straight-shooting approach. I got this video out of sure curiosity and to see if she had any tips. But oh wow- This was a joke. I agree with the reviewer who noted poor production quality and terrible scripting. My friends and I are planning a watch party for the sole purpose to make fun of it.I say it's a joke, but it's also insulting to single women and also single men. She insults the women who attend her conference, she insults the men who she talks to at the round table discussion.... it's just awkward. The disappointing thing, though, is that this isn't the person she is on her TV show.Save your money or buy it cheaply. Or do what I did and make it a watch party for you and your single friends."
1,horrible self help dvd,I was so excited to watch this because Millionare Matchmaker is so funny! And on the show Patti does have great advice and tough love to help people wake up and learn from their mistakes!But this dvd is a total waste of money! DONT BUY IT TRUST ME!!! You will be so disappointed and mad at Patti for attaching her name to something this stupid!
3,Makes some great points,"This self-help video is in a live conference format, Patti giving advice alone, and side comments from commentators. Overall, I think this video makes some great pointers! However, this video is poorly edited and it's too short. During the segments where she talks with the men, she should have chosen men who are ready to get married now. Instead she had two men who in my opinion were not ready to get married. Therefore, their opinion wasn't valuable to me.I wish she touched more on where to meet men. That's the biggest problem for me because I couldn't date 3 guys at once if I had the choice. I can barley date one guy. Overall, it made me consider adding her advice to my repertoire of advice when dealing with men."
2,"Somewhat useful, but not amazing","I expected more from this video. It was a little hard to follow. The tips are there, but how to execute seems vague. It's hard to pack 12 months into an hour video, I think this content is better consumed in written format.Watching this video made me feel like I was watching the recording of a play. It wasn't clear to me that this was just the recording of presentation she had done. I expected something more similar to the format of the millionaire matchmaker, with real world examples."
2,Ok I guess.,Dirtiest mouthed crude-est women on TV with crude-est characters on her show that TV teaches a little about dating. This is a fluff piece as a show followup. Good if you must have it all from this TV show. After watching I decided this show dirties my mind to much to watch it any more.... well thanks for what I got up to that point.
1,not shipped yet,"Ironically, amazon wants me to rate my review of this book but I have not received this yet. I ordered on 1/1/07, still waiting. Perhaps amazon should spend more time making sure their customers received their items in a timely manner and then ask for a review."
5,interesting and completly worth your time,"I found this Anne McCaffrey book to be interesting, especially since I happened to read most of the books, or knew most of the storys referenced to in A Diversity of Dragons. The simple characters (including herself) were straightfoward, yet evasive, and the plot was complicated in its simplicity. The art work was extrordinary, and could only be displayed properly in the large book. Everytime I look at it I am amazed at the generous detail. All in all I believe that this book rates a five star for its simple honesty. Niether defending dragons or bashing them, but sharing their truths. This book is completely worth your time."
2,"Ok, but not perfect!","Received after a couple of weeks. Cover very scratched and marked and a couple of pages ruffled and bent.The amount of content was a little disappointing considering the size of the book, and actually, the only writing of hers that I felt to be poor. - Sorry, not really impressed!"
3,Not quite what I wanted,I was disappointed when the DVD arrived and I discovered that it was not like the VHS tape I had. The VHS has both the original and a colorized version of the movie. The DVD only has the original. Though it is one of my favorite movies.
2,Not one of the Duke's best efforts...,This movie was better when I saw it as a little kid. The plot and characters are not interesting. The singing is a distraction. It is strange seeing Oliver in a western. I was waiting Hardy to show up. The quality of the DVD was questionable and not a good copy.
3,Mainly Nostalgia,I give this movie 3 stars mainly out of nostalgia. I doubt that contemporary veiwers will get much out of this unless they are cinamatography buffs that enjoy films from this era.
3,Classic drama of heroes and scoundrels,"Set in an America between The Revolution and The Civil War, the Fighting Kentuckian tells a story most likely unknown to most Europeans - the colonization of Alabama by French immigrants, many having served as generals and other officers in Napoleon's armies up to the defeat at Waterloo in 1815. John Wayne represents the foot soldier in The Militia as it slogs its way between insurgencies and ""in-fighting"". Taking to a French general's daughter at the outset of the film, Wayne's character questions the intriguing & thieving land-owners, the theft of another man's land, local power struggles and general dishonesty. At the end of course the good wins over bad, Wayne's character wins the girl and all live happily ever after. If you want entertainment a la Westerns',some French mystique and a feeling of the Classic movie starring Vivien Leigh & Clark Gable...then you have your Saturday night entertainment well in hand."
3,The Duke and Ollie Make a Splendid Team,"The inspired pairing of John Wayne and comedian Oliver Hardy, along with some memorable action sequences, elevate ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" (1949) to a higher level than most Republic Westerns. Wayne and Hardy work wonderfully together - it's markedly different from the Laurel and Hardy chemistry, but just as special. The only dead spot is a wooden and miscast Vera Hruba Ralston as Wayne's leading lady. Otherwise, ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" is solid Republic craftsmanship."
3,"Pleasant, but nothing special","A Kentucky soldier (John Wayne) falls for a French general's daughter (Vera Ralston) and gets mixed up in a battle between unscrupulous river traders and French settlers. Nothing remarkable here. It's pure formula right down to the end, when the cavalry comes to the rescue. Oliver Hardy is entertaining in a rare appearance without Stan Laurel./"
3,An unforgettable match-up!,"This historical action film is not remarkable for its drama. It's importance lies primarily in the somewhat serendipitous casting of perhaps the two most influential ""character"" actors in movie history: John Wayne and Oliver Hardy. Whose styles have been copied more than those of Duke and Babe? (Not to dismiss Mr. Laurel). The rating is a very HIGH three."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I'll admit, I'm not a big John Wayne fan. If you've seen one of his westerns, you've seen them all. I fell asleep TWICE when trying to watch this one. The only redeeming part was seeing Oliver Hardy trundling around in buckskins, doing pratfalls and slapstick. His lifelong comedy partner, Stan Laurel was too ill to take part, and I tend to think he became ill after looking at the script."
4,Charming western with a few minor flaws,"As another reviewer mentioned, the movie is a bit slow to start and leaves some plot points unexplained (yes, why *is* John Breen trying to get out of going with his regiment?) but is overall very enjoyable. Wayne is courtly and charming (nobody says ""ma'am"" like he does), and Oliver Hardy (showing off his native Georgian accent) is so adorable, I wanted to put him in my pocket. Truly an inspired piece of casting; thank goodness Wayne kept after Hardy when he initially refused to work without Stan Laurel. Vera Ralston as the French general's daughter was not the best choice, and I kept getting the two mustached villians mixed up, but I happily stayed with the movie until the ""big calvary rescue"" ending, and would watch it again. This DVD also includes some good behind the scenes photos, and plenty of interesting production notes."
4,Delightful old time hollywood frontier story,"The Fighting Kentuckian is a frontier classic that's a perfect John Wayne vehicle. Its the type of picture that I would stay up till one am to see when I was a boy in the early 60's. The old style marching, singing, and fighting is a fine escape for its duration. Not realistic and all old time Hollywood I would recomend it to anyone just for the fun of it."
4,"A great book but PREVIEW for ""adult content"" for younger readers","As an adult I thought this book was interesting and fairly well-written. My daughter (aged 11) read all but chapters 5 and 7 (which I read aloud to her so I could skip the ""offensive"" parts. I read the entire book beforehand...and that is how I know.) A few paragraphs in Chapters 5 and 7 are not appropriate if a parent/teacher were not comfortable with their student reading about couples living together before marriage (and sex) as well as some ""adult ideas"" about ""the other sex"". Even though Wanda Gag surely had these thoughts and did indeed live with Earle Humphreys and later married him, the descriptions about these issues do not belong in a book written for the 9-12 age group. It would probably be fine for high school or an adult, but I would make sure to exercise caution for readers any younger."
1,Important information!,"Did you know that in 1983, the American Anthropological Association declared Freeman's ""Margaret Mead"" to be ""poorly written, unscientific, irresponsible and misleading""? Better to read Paul Shankman's work, and pick up a copy of his ""The Trashing of Margaret Mead."" Shankman's work is more balanced and scholarly."
1,A sexist bully parodies historical research,"The author is a bully. He attempts to bully the reader by totally unscholarly failure to consider alternative explanations and to present data contrary to his obsessional besmirching of Margaret Mead (NOT just attacking her first book).Since his first book attacking COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA, Freeman has become obsessed with sex. How stormy adolescence in Samoa was was in 1925-26 the ""problem"" Mead was studying, but Freeman now only sees the existence of ""free love"" as Mead's focus (any reading of what Mead wrote shows how false this). Moreover, Freeman's always palpable misogyny has extended to fagbashing in this book.Too bada that Vladimir Nabokov is not around to write about Freeman's obsession with the (ghost of) the young Margaret Mead -- and what he portrays as her evil father. . ."
1,Ouch,"Let us see here: Freeman goes on to correct the picture of Samoa, and then uses incomplete and second-hand, and at times downright silly evidence to prove that Mead uses incomplete, second hand, and downright silly evidence.Now, I am not the biggest fan of Mead, but she is the most misinterpreted anthropologist (probably as she is most popular), and Freeman's sociobiological approach simply goes nowhere.I also resent the fact that Freeman was an intellectual covard, who chose to wait until Mead's death to publish any critique, in order for her to not be able to respond to it. For shame!"
5,Don't shoot the messenger,It's hard to accept that an cultural icon was once a brilliant yet gullible young woman or that a vaunted paradigm of Anthropology is fatally flawed. This book contrary to ad hominem attackers of Freeman tells the story with a compelling and accurate history of Mead' researches. You won't be able to put it down (literaly or figuratively) or stop thinking of its implications.
5,The book rings true because it accords with prior evidence.,"Derek Freeman's book caught my eye because I had been told similar things about Margaret Mead's research by a trusted Samoan friend several years ago. He told me that he once had a radio talk show in American Samoa and he was able to interview several of the women who, as young girls, had served as the source for Mead's information. As I recall it, they told him that they had noticed that Mead seemed to want to hear stories of their loose sexual behavior, and they simply gave her lots of what she wanted. Putting this story over on Mead, he said, seemed to be a great source of merriment to the girls.I don't think the Samoan friend is putting one over on me. Should any serious researchers want to interview him (He lives in the Washington, DC, area), I would be glad to arrange the contact."
3,Horrible translation,"It's unfortunate that Klima's brilliance is translated so poorly in this edition. I wish I could read the original Czech version. But the novel was engaging and contained good insight about human relationships. Portions were greatly worded, and had a well-constructed plot. But at times the author lapses into tedious unnecessary narrative. Overall a good read and a nice introduction to the genre."
4,A fascinating journey,The Ultimate Intimacy is a fascinating journey into the mind and heart of a protestant pastor and the temptation he faces in his quest for true love. A must read.
4,"When BOC dies, will its music fade away?","I must admit that my vote of 4 is more out of amazement that this band can still put on a great show than in finding anything terribly special about this CD. Before fellow BOC heads beat the tar out of me, wait just a second. This is a really good album for those of us already under the BOC magic; I doubt it will win a great many converts. But, they picked a first class set of songs, Buck Dharma's at his best, and it's a great way to reinvigorate your desire to upgrade your entire BOC collection to CD. The weakest part of the record are the vocals. Not Eric Blooms, but the rest. God, you'd figure that you could at least sing on key, but getting old will do that to you, I guess."
1,Horrible... Horrible... Horrible,"I enjoy music. I love music. And while I am not a diehard BOC fan, this recording is absolutely horrid. I've got a keen ear for things, and with today's technology of digital, I would only expect to hear clean, crisp recordings. Even for live events. But this live piece of tripe is a major chore to try to sit through. This does not sound good turned way up, let alone at normal level. There should be no excuse for this.Technically the boys can play. But they cannot sing and they obviously cannot hear. Regarding the dreadful singing talents of Eric Bloom, he should stop...Now.But this recording really blows. The mix is completely off. Sometimes the drums overpower even the guitars, let alone the voice. I think the boys have playing concerts so loud through the years, they cannot tell how they themselves sound.Such a shame. They should just let the recording sessions do their magic."
4,"Interesting and Insightful, But By No Means Easy","If you are a beginning meditator, this book will be very difficult to digest. It is a scholarly examination of Tsongkhapa's exploration of quiescence, an advanced approach to refining attentive powers. It is well written and very well sourced and represents a wealth of information for the advanced meditator, but you have to be willing to study this book. It took me almost 6 weeks to read, but it was worth the effort."
3,Interesting Rhythm,"To book eventually goes from a chapter to chapter switching from the old days (interesting) to the 1969 tour and back. I skip over any parts that don't have to do with the Stones directly and that helps keep it interesting. Entirely too much time spent on the question ""Will I get the rights to do this book?"". Want to just get the stories. He runs hot and cold but generally when he talks about the Stones (or quote Keith), it is a good read, especially if you read it while listening to old Stones records."
1,Just rubbish,"Almost impossible to read, each page was an effort and then then not worth it. It took 15 years to write, I soon realised it would take just as long to read, so I gave up. Save your money."
1,ramblings of junked up pseud,"I bought this book to understand more about one of the greatest Rock and Roll bands ever. What did I get instead? the incoherant ramblings of a a junked up pseud.The book is almost impossible to read, no wonder nobody wanted to publish it.Total waste of money!"
4,Great reading once you get into it,"Having been a Stones fan for ever I was looking forward to reading this book, however at first I put it right back down again as the author's style was a bit hard to get into. Later when I picked it up and got through the Author Block on my behalf I found this to be a really well written insight into the the Stones and what went on around them. Having sampled first hand in some ways the lifestyles described in this book I found it bringing back memories good and bad of those times when I doubt if anyone really knew what was going.on.This is really two books in one the history of the Stones and memories of hanging out with the Stones themselves.A great book overall.I hope that Stanley Booth is rewarded justly for the work he put into this book he deserves it, as do the Stones for the work they have done over the years."
3,"Good, but...","I thought the book was very good, although I found the prose and the sentence structure somewhat laborious at times, Lawrence Sterne he is not. I was expecting more sordid details but the book primarily focuses on the various relationships, which it accomplishes very well. All in all I received what appears to be an accurate depiction of the Rolling Stones personal orbit. I did have a real problem with the author maintaining that Brian Jones was a better guitarist than Mick Taylor, which simply is not so."
4,Odd writing style but good read,"The writing style was a bit odd, and the chronology jumped around a bit but you get used to it, the author was trying to tell a few different stories and wove them together, the Brian Jones thread and the Stones rise thread.A good book about the end of the Brian Jones era and the beginning of the Mick Taylor era, and the rise of the Stones."
3,Read this Book!,"Okay, we are dealing with a time capsule here and not a retrospective. The private glimpses of the Stones backstage and commanding their audience from it, are worth the wading through this long tome. I understand what Booth was doing, but I was still getting lost; I sometimes wasn't sure of which tour I was viewing. I'm not the hugest fan of ""I'm Free,"" so, his obsessive noting of whether or not it was included in the set just became exceedingly annoying. The incessant harping on the brutality and presence of cops at the concerts became increasingly tiresome. Yet, I still loved this book. And really, I was glad it ran on. Booth actually comes out with some really nice imagery and turns of phrase once in a while. I prefer Richard's ""Life,"" but if you need more, this is a nice read. I do believe that this book contains the best play by play of the Altamont show that one can find outside of the ""Gimme Shelter"" Criterion Collection DVD."
3,Good,"Yeah, I liked this, but there weren't sections I've read over and over like some other Stones books. It took Stanley Booth more than ten years to write this. I think that if he'd gotten the text down sooner, the feel would have been more urgent. Some of the feel and memories I think dried up by the time he finished it. But a decent read for any Stones fan. And I liked how Mick was embarrassed when someone called him on his stinky feet, and how he acted shy singing in front of Stanely Booth. He can sing in front of tens of thousands, but to sing in front of one person he knows gives him stage fright. Ahhh, Mick, I luv ya yer vulnerabilities!"
2,Abstract Writign Style,"I have tried desperately to make it thru this book. I love reading about classic rock bands and this is the 11th 300+ page book that I have read this year. I found the writing style to be so abstract that I couldn't follow the story. It jumps all over the place. The author takes quite of bit of liberty with sentence structure / style so it is an awkward read. I tried to come back to this book a few times and even tried skipping forward, but I just cant get comfortable with it. I feel bad since I never give up on books, but its on to the next one for me."
2,Did not enjoy this book,"Was looking forward to reading this because I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Life"" by Keith Richards! I thought this book was very boring and did not appreciate the authors style of writing. Guess you can't always go by reviews!"
1,"Living Vicariously through your puppets, An Author's Howto.","Simply put the title of this author's books should be ""Living Vicariously through your puppets, An Author's Howto."" For the characters never develop, they are simply how would a character react to this situation, next situation same character, as the saying goes ""lather rinse repeat"". Heros that fail only when the author needs them to or when the editor told the author to make changes is like watching bad prime time sitcoms, an eternity of pain."
4,Minds are not adapted to probability.......i used to believe,"but the author shook my firm believe in this. as a finance ""specialist"" i always believed that even the trained mind in probabilities had difficulties with imagining and visualising odds. the authors argument in this book is ground-breaking to me. probabilities, percentages and other normalised forms of representing risk are relatively recent. In contrast, natural frequencies result from natural sampling, the process by which humans and animals have encountered information about ris during most of their evolution. just for this part, chapter 1 ""insight"", the book is wort every penny for those interested in probability and the perception of it."
3,Mixed feelings,"We got my 7 year old son this toy for Christmas. He is absolutely in love with it - so in that sense, it's a success. However, we are finding it very difficult to make the little figures without having holes in them. I would say we only have about a 30% success rate. When one comes out without any holes, everyone is very excited and he and his brother love painting them. But, we end up throwing away a lot of broken near-misses."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I brought this product in good faith only to find it does not work at all. I tried the skins on 3 different CD players (1 Blue Ray, 2 Regular dvd) using 3 different movie DVDs. The skins failed 100% of the time, all of them giving a ""No Disk Error"" on all 3 players and cds.The concept for this product is really good but the product sent to me just does not work at all. I have advised the Depot Factory of this problem and hope they can provide a useable product in the future.To add insult to injury, they tell me I cant return the product for a refund, since it is a ""media item"". In addition even though I purchased a 50 Pack item they shipped me 10-5 pack cases. I only opened the 1st case and never even opened the other 9 cases. So anyone with any brain at all tell me how are the other 45 disks compromised in any way? This is just a total rip off.I contacted my credit card company to stop payment on this fradulent product. I would never buy anything from this company again."
2,most dont work,"My xbox will not read the games with the d_skin on the disc, my dvd player does not read the dvd's with the d_skin on the dvd and neither does my laptop's dvd-rom. Out of the 50 i think only about 20 have worked with my pc games where my desktop will read the games but none of the other elctronics i have will read them with the d_skin. Some fit on very well which give them a higher chance of working but some fit on very very loose, they're so loose that i dont even understand how the d_skin and the dvd/cd will spin together while being read. I wouldn't recommend buying this, its a real disappointment."
1,One Star is too Generous,"""The D-Skin Protective Disc Skins will protect your discs from scratches, dirt, fingerprints, and more."" Just don't expect your DVD player to play the entire movie without freezing up. My DVD / game collection consists of over 4,000 disks. I purchased 2,000 of these based on the previous reviews. After installing these, I have yet to find a DVD that will play from the beginning to the end without freezing up. Perhaps it is my brand of DVD player??? ( I have 10 different Sony DVP-NS725P DVD players throughout the house and the same thing happens on all of them)."
2,"Good idea, but has flaws","My buddy got me into these when I borrowed DVDs without a case. They played great and worked in my computer with no problems but later discovered issues. The first issue is that you cannot keep up with cost. They are too expensive to use with a large collection. I liked how they work while still on but this doesn't apply for older DVDs. They will also not fit in systems with DVD slots like a car system where the DVD gets pulled into a slot and not put on a tray. Also, after being on the DVD in humidity, the humidity builds up and creates a small layer of moisture not allowing it to play unless you take it off, air it out and put it back on. At that point, I just keep it off. Finally, if you don't have the skin on 100%, it simply will not work...and you will know it right away."
1,Ruined my cd's,"this product Ruined my cd's. At first i loved the product, it kept my cd's scratch free and worked in my car stereo, but after a few month i noticed my cd's getting foggy, so i took the skins off and noticed that somehow my cd's with dew/moisture that had somehow got under the skins. needless to say i was pissed. it is so hard to get in touch with the company to complain and all the cd's i used the skins on have a permanent haze/foggy appearance."
4,d skins,"ive use these for along while and they are great! my daughters relaxation cd was reason i bought hem. they work forlong time. better if u clean disc b4 apllying. them,Havent had any problems with them until they start to get worn. Have had several friends ""borrow"" some ...an they never come back nor have they given ny their replacments they bought. lol. if u have scratches already run it throu a repair process first for beter results......greaton my daugher cube, wii ....wish they made them smaller for the small cds as well...but we wont have this prob now that slot music is coming out."
2,Don't bother,"Product claims to work in player while the ""skin"" is on. This was not the case for me. I used the skins on DVD's and put the DVD's in several different players. None of them worked with the skin on. They are good protection from scratches and prints while not playing the DVD but a bit of a hassle since they don't work in the player."
5,Great CD protection,D Skin Protective Game Skins 50 PackI started off with a 5 pack from a local store and liked them. Now thisis my second purchase of a 50 pack. They work great on my CDs. I put one on any new purchase before playing it.They work well in all 3 of my CD players and on my PC. They did NOT work in the car. I would not advise trying it as I had to take my car to the dealer to get the CD back out and it was damaged beyond repair.I have not tried them on any DVD players yet.
2,eh,d skin is a really great idea but it just doesnt work that well. On some stereos it works fine and on others it will skip or not even play ay all. Some car stereos wont even take the disk in if it has a d skin on. i give it 2 stars because i got 25 of them just to throw all of them away.
2,Wanted them to work,"I really wanted this product to work. I have two young kids who seem to find my CDs, DVDs and X-Box disks no matter what I do with them. I bought 50 of these things when Victor Lucas on G4-TV said they work. Victor, you let me down. My X-Box doesn't read through them about 50% of the time, TWO different DVD players have an even worse record and my computer and car stereo won't read through them at all. It's been about two months and I think I've removed every single one I applied. So much for protecting Halo 2, if your X-Box can't read the game.None of the other reviews here even hint at this problem, but I swear I'm putting them on right (I can feel each ""tooth"" snap into place around the disk). As far as I'm concerned, this is a great idea that just doesn't work reliably."
4,Nifty Product,"My daughter loves to play her DVDs in her own player, but at aged 4 she isn't to kind to the discs. These skins are a great solution. She can touch them, drop them, etc. without permanently harming them. My only complaint is that my DVD player in my Chevrolet Tahoe won't accept them. All the other players (4) we have put them in have not even noticed they are on the disc."
5,This book makes me cry!,"But in a good way. As a momma to a three-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl, the last line, about how they'll go on being big brother and little sister, ""even until we're all grown up"" does it to me every time! Such a sweet and realistic view of siblings at this age."
1,Unrealistic.,"Whether you like it or you don't, scientific evidence supports the theory that race plays a major role defining someone's potential.The environment and cultural factors will only help or hinder your ability to develop THAT potential, in the same way certain roads will allow you to run a sports car at max speed and some won't.But no speedway on earth is going to change the specs of your car, you know that don't you?"
3,Good Speed Metal,"If you miss late 80's speed metal, this CD will satisfy your craving. The bass & drums are solid and tight, the guitar work & the vocals are both above average for this genre. Of course, the novelty item here is the female vocalist. I know that in 2000 that doesn't seem out of place for a Scandinavian band. But in the city of LA circa 1987, it just wasn't done. In keeping within the style back then, most of the lyrics are not great. Not as bad as Racer X, but you get the idea. Overall, though, it's a pretty good disc."
5,A Pearl in the Sea of Published Crap,"The book is excellent: fantastically well written, with an interesting story from different characters' perspectives. The story stands alone very nicely and is even better, like an onion, has many layers for the person who has a well-rounded knowledge of world religions."
2,Too scattered and sketchy,"While I found the premise interesting, I simply couldn't feel emotionally connected with any of the characters in this book. Although they are described in detail they are still too much like caricatures to elicit any sympathy or understanding. Possibly because the author doesn't have the time or space to expand on each character - every chapter is based on a different character in the story - there is no real exploration of their motives and they come across as quite cliched. The setting was a good choice - a pilgrimage through the desert with Muslims making the Hajj, traders and a bridal procession, but not enough was done with it or maybe the cast of characters was just too large. Perhaps if the author had concentrated on two or three characters instead then the story might have been more meaningful and engrossing. The saddlebag itself was not enough to hold all this together for me."
4,Really Good Classic Niven,"If you've never read one of Niven's stories, this is probably not the one to start with. Start with the short story collections, like Tales of Known Space. But when you get hooked on his style and find that you can't get enough, do come back to it, buy it, and you will enjoy it thoroughly. It's a really fun, very well-rounded look at a colony whose founders choose, at its inception, to divide its society into haves and the have-nots."
4,"Intersting, and yes, cool.","On a planet where the only habitable place is the plateau on a mountain rising fifteen miles above the acidic, roiling surface, a brutal and unjust aristocracy lives long lives on the organs of the people of the lower classes, (colonists), who had committed even the smallest transgressions, while the rich, (crew), do as they wish with no fear of consequences of repercussions. On this world a young colonist with a very strange mental power, that of making himself invisible in others' minds, is about to unwittingly set off a revolution. I said it before, I'll say it again. Cool."
5,"Fantastic, classic 'Hard-Core' Sci-Fi","One of the earliest books in the ""Known Space"" Universe, 'A Gift From Earth' brings us to a struggling colony scratching out a difficult existance on a high plateau- the only habitable spot on the planet! Along with the technical gizmoes thet Sci-Fi fans love, Niven makes some interesting points on the nature of human social interaction. Niven also delves into the paranormal, in a realistic, believable manner.I've read this book many times over the years- I keep coming back to the intriguing storyline and universe that Niven has constructed."
3,"Fast-paced, but nothing special","This is my first Niven novel and, given his popularity, I have to assume its not one of his better works. The explanation for the hero's talent was a bit too far-fetched and his motivation for penetrating into the dangerous Hospital was extremely weak. There was also that annoying streak of fascism that surfaces so often in science-fiction, particularly that of the ""Old Masters."" Both oppressor and oppressed alike seem the recognize a need for capital punishment and concealing from the public the true circumstances surrounding it. It is up to extraordinary individuals to make rational choices about what is good for the common man.I give it three stars for its solid prose and the imaginative story that kept me reading despite the above-mentioned flaws. Still, maybe I should have begun with ""Ringworld."""
2,Swap Meet,Not a very good Movie but Cheryl Rixon was in it and She is one Sexy Lady also it has Me and My Cousins Eddie and Jessica as Extras lol !
5,my second Master heater,"I just got my new Master heater from Amazon.com and it fired right up flawlessly! Now I can give my old one to my son. It's a 1974 90,000 btu unit that still works very well. A great product sold by a nice company."
2,Equipment was not complete in package,I ordered this part and the order was not complete the assembly components were missing as well as other items. Need to check complete items in box before shipping occurs.
4,Couldn't put it down.,"Being an obsessed golfer, I really enjoyed the ""play-by-play"" and the ""insider"" information the story provides. It is generally very well written (there were numerous typo's - poor editing). I just didn't want to put it down. It was like I was experiencing it with him.It's a great success story, one that anyone will enjoy."
5,Dreams Do Come True,"Michael D'antonio best yet. Makes you feel as if you where there. This is about people helping people. What a great book. Thanks Michael, this has movie all over it."
3,Amazing number of errors,"This book was very entertaining and a quick read. Many interesting insights about Q school and the grinders on the tour. I would have rated this book higher, but I could not overlook the abundance of typos and other errors. I have never read a book with so many obvious mistakes. Somebody at Hyperion should have invested a few bucks in a proofreader."
1,My purchase,"You want a review? I'll give you a review! It has been over a month and I still haven't received my purchase! Well, I guess that means it sucks like a black hole and I'll bet nobody ever sees this message. I will never use Amazon again. If I feel like wasting money, next time I'll just throw it down the sewer. Since I can't leave a review without selecting at least one star, consider it a minus one!"
5,"Simple, broad, enjoyable narrative history, A Gem.","A broad-ranging map-based narrative history written by an historian with a wonderful turn of phrase and a quirky sense of humor. The vision of stone age hunters chasing ""the inglorious snail and the frankly sessile nut"" has remained with me for many years."
4,Safari rug,"Safari no problems. Color true to photo. Nice sturdy rug. Looks great in a brown , black or even white room. Delivery was quick with no damage."
4,Really fun supplemental features,"My four-star rating is specifically for this disc's supplemental features. MONSTER A GO GO itself is a poverty row type of genre film that mainly appeals to fans of Le Bad Cinema. However, the disc's extras are very entertaining. The two music shorts were directed by the film's director Bill Rebane, presenting some really cool early sixties rock and roll from the likes of Ral Donner. Those two color shorts are worth the bargain price of the DVD. There's also a very good 24 page booklet reprint of an article about the filming of MONSTER A GO GO. Director Bill Rebane also contributes both an audio commentary track and a video interview. Of the latter two extas, the video interview is the better bet. The DVD transfer of the main feature is the best print of that film I have ever seen, for whatever that's worth."
4,chug-chug,"Okay boys...movie-junkies are patiently waiting for the DVD release of this film...and while I'm a-wishin', how about sweetening up the soundtrack with some DTS effects? Oh, to hear the engines of this boat chug and wheeze in hi-fi surround sound..."
3,The Cast,"Tony Curtis and Cary Grant are at their handsomest. You should see Cary in his admiral outfit. But, in my opinion, you may disagree, a very obvious flaw is the weak cast of women. I was casting it in my mind as I watched. Marilyn Monroe would have been hilarious-- and Thelma Ritter as the mechanic. Of course, with a stellar cast, the parts would have had to be better for them. The pink sub is hilarious and the men seem very relaxed, glad to get non-challenging roles. This is a must for the 50's comedies collector and has that great super-bright photography."
2,A candidate for worst,"What's the worst Cary Grant of all-time? Penny Serenade? I Was a Male Warbride? It's probably the latter, but don't rule out Operation Petticoat. Grant does his usual fine job; he's not the problem. He always plays Cary Grant. But the story is ridiculous, sexist in the extreme, and largely unfunny. A pink sub saved by a bra. Tony Curtis as Sargeant Bilko. A girdle in the machine area keeping a submarine going for hundreds of miles. A slapstick ending. Well, maybe this really is the all-time worst Grant film."
5,Classic Cary Grant Comedy,"I love anything WWII - add in the iconic Cary Grant, Tony Curtis and several beautiful Army Nurses all stuck on a submarine - it's a classic!"
4,Great old classic,"This is a wonderful movie, funny, smart, clever, sweet. It has great humor with out stupid gross or fraternity jokes. Cary Grant and Tony Curtis play well against each other, Arthur O'Connel is great as the chief and the sexual tension between Grant and one of the nurses is priceless. Blake Eswards is known for the Pink Panther movies, but this is really one of his best."
3,Operation Petticoat - FYI this disc,"I'm not sure how I missed it but I did! This disc, has NO SUBTITLES/CAPTIONs, whatsoever. Although this is a fun little movie reproduced here with good production values (the video quality is pretty good, not just for it's age but also for the fact that's it's only standard play) because I've got the beginnings of a hearing issue I have gotten used to turning on the subtitles... just to make sure I'm catching everything that's going on in the flick. But in this case , I just have to wing it; view it, that is, without the help of the captions."
4,"Good Laughs, Interesting Cast","Feminists would hate this movie, if they saw it today. Hollywood would never make it now in first place, unless roles were reversed and men were made to look like sex objects. That would meet PC double standards.Nonetheless, agendas aside, there is a lot of good humor in here; the story is interesting, and you get a well-known cast with Cary Grant, Tony Curtis, Dina Merrill, Arthur O'Connell, Gavin MacLeod and Marian Ross. The latter went on to be big names on television more than movies, MacLeod on ""Mary Tyler Moore"" and Ross on ""Happy Days.""This was Happy Days on a ship, at least when some attractive women board the vessel. Grant has the best lines in the film - speaking lines, that is. Good entertainment. Lots of laughs before the PC police made it impossible to laugh at anything, including ourselves."
5,Fantastic Film!!,"I enjoy watching this movie, over and over again! It's one of my favorites (of older and newer movies). Cary Grant and Tony Curtis are wonderful. Curtis is cunning and charming, while Grant is the strong leader, with a sense of adventure and humor. Many classic lines, like ""now that's what I call scavenging!"" (referring to Curtis returning with a boat full of nurses). At times, too funny for words. The little scenes that take place all over the sub are just classic. A delightful and funny movie!!"
4,Breezy Service Comedy,"The high point of ""Operation Petticoat"" is the repartee between a deadpan Cary Grant as the beleagured sub captain and Tony Curtis' smooth operator. The film is consistently entertaining but I would have to say the laugh consistency falls somewhere between classic screwball and sitcom. This film is a good antedote for one of those gloomy days and you want to let in a little sunshine. On a side note does anybody remember the sitcom this film spun-off circa 1977-78 with John Astin in the Grant role and a very young Jaime Lee Curtis as one of the nurses?"
3,Great Movie - But not for widescreen TV's,"This is by far a movie classic. Lots of great humor from two of my favorite actors Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. If you have a standard TV (4:3 aspect ratio) you will enjoy the widescreen version of this very funny movie.If, however, you have a widescreen TV (16:9 aspect ratio) this DVD may not be for you. Artisan has chosen to record the DVD in a non-anamorphic format so the best you can do (and still retain the proper vertical to horziontal proportions) is gray bars on the sides and black bars top and bottom."
4,jeff chandler: between the pages,"jeff chandler, actor of many motion pictures some 40 years ago, died before his time & before he explored all of his overt & hidden talents. this broad sweeping book covers his early childhood in brooklyn, ny and proves the old adage that we are indeed the sum of all that comes before us. through the pages of this well-researched book, the author traces mr. chandler's life, his take on his co-stars, directors, locations but most of all his private life and how you can't have both: a successful career and a marriage that is a success. personal & private life often gets strained & sometimes fractured. his was no different."
4,Gong - 'Angel's Egg / Shamal' (Virgin) 2-CD Reissue,"Another repackaged 2-CD release for you Gong completists.Disc one is of their stellar 1973 release 'Angel's Egg' and their third Daevid Allen-less effort,1976's let down lp 'Shamal'(see my reviews of both)."
3,good movie,when i watch this movie i go back in time the eighties are so cool christopher collet was good corey haim also was good just the way the film was made i dont know this is a very good movie i will always have it
2,WHAT A WASTE!,"The one big problem I had with this movie is the scumbag, coke-dealing boyfriend is supposed to be the bad guy when the kids come off as bigger assholes. Kinda made me wish the boyfriend would've killed her son after recovering the stolen coke. While it turns out the boyfriend has some illegal dealings and comes on too strong, the role portrayed a sincere effort to reach the kids. Conversely, the children are either constantly fighting, mouthing off to teachers and resisting any attempts to get along (notwithstanding suspicious behavior and ongoings). Not that black and white cowboy hats should be used to know good from bad, but through the large gray area came a sympathy for the boyfriend and thought that the kids needed a good skullcracking (opposite of what was intended). Few adjustments would've taken this from so-so to a good movie."
1,Poor quality,Excited to see that this has been released in the US.. but disappointed by the quality. Looks like a VHS transfer. Do yourself a favor and buy a Multi-system DVd player and order the PAL version.
1,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed after reading the reviews. I'd describe the writing as trite, superficial and filled with cliches. No serious character development. Not in the same league with Lecarre or even Furst. Reads like a first novel, which of course it is. Maybe his later work is better."
3,"Finder Fan, but not keen on this one","I discovered Joseph Finder by reading Power Play. Typically, I exhaust each new author I discover. Finder is a very good author. When it came to The Moscow Club, I found it riveting but scattered.Wonderful Soviet background information, but it just didn't live up to my expectations from reading nearly all of his previous novels. I understand this was his first novel, and I'm glad I found Power Play before I read this one, or I may not have become as big a fan of Finder as I am now.The subplots were interesting, and the premise was really unique, which is part of what makes Finder such a good author, he comes up with really good basic plots. It kept my interest, but I always felt like it was very scattered and difficult to follow. I have not found that in his subsequent novels.I definitely recommend it in terms of a good read, but some of his later writings will get you hooked on his writing style more readily."
3,Complex but interesting,"I just started reading Finder so am enjoyably working my way through his novels. I agree with other reviewers that this one is complex and really could have used a key to the characters. Finder always has a twist at the end and I did not see this one coming although I easily figured out who ""M3"" was. The chases got tiresome after the 5th (10th? 15?) one. The novel did stimulate my interest in Russian/Soviet history though. If you like this genre, I'd recommend this book even though dated somewhat."
4,Good but dated,When will you come out with something new? Love your character Nick Heller but come on get to work already
5,Excellent Debut Novel,"Joseph Finder knows his stuff! I am an avid reader who reads 1-2 novels a week. After polishing off several Grishams and Pattersons, I was looking for something new. My mom gave me an old copy of The Moscow Club. I could not put it down. The details that Finder weaves through the story are amazing and the pace is breathtakingly quick. There are no places to take a breather and I am still tired from missing way too much sleep. I am about finished with his second book, Extraordinary Powers, and it is just as fine. Time to order his third...."
3,Competent but biased,"White has certainly written a useful work, giving a contemporary view of the Presidential Election of 1960, but his bias in favor of the Democrats cannot be denied."
3,Book Description:,"As this book has no description, here is what is on the inside flap of the cover:The Making of the President is one of the world's most mysterious and complicated transactions in power. No troops mass on election day, no bands play, no clandestine conspiracies gather to strike violence at the political jugular. It is an adventure for which men have planned, plotted and calculated years before the country wakes to their ambitions. It is a pageant re-enacted every four years, in which the most squalid and the most selfless characters in American life all play a role. It is a game in which many can play, but only one can win.I found the book to be informative but slightly leaning to the left (democrats). Not very engaging, but worthy read."
3,A book about a book???,"I bought this book thinking it was actually 'Owney, the Mail-Pouch Pooch', which we originally checked-out from the local library. Unfortunately, this book only features part of Owney's fascinating and almost unbelievable travels...and the pictures are only sketches of the original photographs that are in the other book. Over all, I was really disapointed in this re-telling about Owney. The details are just not there, especially after reading the other book. This edition might be good for little ones, like maybe three and up, who can't sit still through a more detailed version, but 'Owney, the Mail-Pouch Pooch' offers the listener a richer version of the story with REAL photographs of who is assumed to be Owney. This book, in my opinion, just doesn't cut-it. Consider the other book instead."
5,A lucky dog a lucky reader,This is an excellent story about a dog who was an exceptional creature living extraordinary adventures .Highly recommend for young readers
5,excellent,"this is one of the best purchases that one can make for their bike, and it's pretty inexpensive. They never slip so your grips will stay put no matter how much torque to put on the them or how wet they get. Also makes installation and removal a breeze since the actual grip part doesn't even touch the handlebar."
4,Grand adventure fun,"I picked this up simply because I was unaware that Dylan Thomas wrote novels. The novel is a great light read - the story of competing traders of copa with very different views of the natives - tied up in a traditional adventure story of good vs. evil. Toss in a corpse, a beautiful mixed-blood woman, more than a little gin, a missionary, a noble young warrior ... In short fun but not necessarily great literature."
4,Correction: Not by Dylan Thomas,The Beach of Falesa was written by R.L Stevenson; there must be some sort of misprint or confusion here.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$$,"I have had this book on my wish list for a little over 2 years now and finally went ahead and purchased it. I agree with what the others said it is a coloring book, sure wish they would have had more information here on Amazon regarding that because I would not have wasted the money on shipping and handling for a Coloring Book.I have other books that I recommend if you are interested in Brownstones and Rowhouses I would suggest:{{The Baltimore Rowhouse}} by by Mary Ellen Hayward, Charles Belfoure, Charles Belfour, Mary Ellen Haywood{{Town Houses: Urban Houses from 1200 to the Present Day}} by Marcus Binney{{Bricks and Brownstones : The New York Row House}} by Charles LockwoodRespectfully Reviewed"
2,"No Text, Just Pictures",This is a sketch book of typical rowhouse architectural features. The sketches are crude and seem to invite crayons. There is no text and nothing to put the designs in context. I hoped for more.
5,My neighbors house is in it I think,"I got this coloring book for my birthday, and its treally fun. I think my neighbors house is in a picture. I think . I colored them all with paints, and they looked good. I live in Brooklyn and saw houses around here that people live in. I don't always love houses but its fun to see the type of house you live in. A lot of times you never do. Most people live in regular houses that aren't connected to each other. I loved this book. Its intresting and educational about seeing things that you forget about that are neat when you have to see them to paint them right."
5,Love,"It is a wonderful book, I have collected all her Sholan Alliance novels she is a very good writer. Have to give a read!"
2,"better but much, much worse","WARNING: PLOT EXPOSURE. While it is true that Norman's writing ability increased from the first, her characters are poorly developed - neither Kusak or Carrie, the two main characters, experience any growth throughout the book. The plot is also extremely contrived. I knew the moment it said she was pregnant that the fact she would lose the child was as much a certainty that she would survive for the next installment of Norman's series. Norman didn't disappoint - or did, by showing that she wasn't below using lame plot devices and contrived events to make sure Carrie isn't ""burdened"" by a child. Other events within the book carry (pun not intended) a similar quality."
4,A subtle political story,"A Latinamerican military coup movie without explicit scenes of violence.Seen through the eyes of a twelve yearsold boy , it manages to drive home the cruelty of the happenings, in a very subtle way.People disappear,the teacher changes, the father looses his job to a uniforned goon, all done -as a change for the worse-without the usual scenes of horror and violence.I recommend this movie. It helps to understand Latinamerican politics"
3,Quite nice glad I have them,"It is true the booklet is not incredible, but handy. The statue stamp/holder of Bast is quite nice I like it very much, And so far have not had problems with it holding the stamps.I do admit I was hopiing the stamps themselves would have been a bit larger. I like decorating my stuff with them and sometimes they seem small. But over all the are quite nice and I am glad that I purchased them.And for spell work or devotional work they are fine."
5,Awesome hub for a good price.,"What can I say, it does what it should. Quality material, strong jack, good price."
5,Great USB Active Cable!,"What is there to say. Great cable, great PRICE! Connected it to my device and XP associated it to my system in about 20 seconds. Excellent performance. Was a little wary of buying CP Tech because I had never heard of them. Took the chance and am very happy. Thanks Amazon!!"
4,"lego Ferrari, pretty good","This was a good little time-waster for a big fan of Ferrari F1, but it just made me want to buy the $70 larger version with working v10 engine."
5,great,just what i needed at a great price. had a hard time finding in stores and online was too expensive. now i have the replacement blades at a great price
1,Cheap...and i am not talking about the price,"We purchased this for as a gift for our daughter. But when we opened it we discovered that the bottom liner is made out of cheap plastic, similar to the ""one-time use"" costumes we remember form the 80's. It is secured by elastic hoops to the frame of the box. The so-called cover is also made of the same material and is secured by a few strips of Velcro tape. This item would not be suitable for outdoor use, maybe an enclosed porch or semi finished basement. I would not recommend it."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Man what a waste. This movie is so unbelievable it became laughable. Not once did I believe OR empathize with the characters at all. Right from the first scene, I knew the movie was going to be awful - that ridiculous beard Bruce Willis had on was about as good a five years old's Halloween costume. And what was up with the 'crazy' Marshall guy? Are you kidding me? And the `plot twist' with the FBI guys or whatever was brutal. Nonsensical garbage at best. It seemed like the movie was thrown together by about 10 different screenwriters who didn't bother to read what was put on paper before them. Wow - just lame and weak. I guess the only positive thing was I can't complain about the acting because the characters were so unbelievable it didn't matter who or what kind of actors were involved. I want my money back - I could get better kicks with my cash feeding the ducks at the park.."
1,Sadistic crap,"This film is one of the most disturbing I've seen in recent years and I'm not a prude or overly sensitive to violence. There is a character in this film that takes pleasure in watching other people die. The filmmakers obvioulsy share this pleasure. If you like films full of senseless violence where innocent children and teenagers are murdered and their deaths are shown in graphic detail, then this movie is for you. The killer is glorified. There is no payoff at the end, just more senseless violence. If this is where our culture is going, we are in big trouble."
1,Your kidding,How could anyone give this movie five stars? I think this was easily one of the worst movies ever made. Watch Die Hard instead.
4,Muy Buena Pelicula,"Es una muy buena pelicula, recomendable, muy entretenida.Bien pensada. Un buen trabajo tanto del director como de los actores."
4,A solid Bruce Willis actioner...,"I enjoyed the performances of Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollack. Ben Foster is good as Mars, maybe a tad over the top but not excessively so. Michelle Horn, who seems to not be doing acting any longer, is fairly good as Pollack's daughter.There are a few unexplained premises in the plot, but, hey, this is an action film. Not everything has to make total sense..."
4,Majormike,The movie was good. Bruce Willis did a superb job of acting. The movie kept you interested with a nice surprise ending. I recommend it.
5,I Love You Bruce!!,"I am a HUGE Bruce Willis fan and have been since ""Moonlighting"" so I have seen all of his movies. (My favorite to this day is Die Hard 2). So of course I loved this movie just for the fact that he was in it. What was it about again? (Just Kidding). It was a really good Fast-paced action-thriller.I LOVED it and feel that it is one of his best movies. FYI: His daughter in the movie is his oldest daughter in real life with Demi (Rumer Willis)."
4,"If you like Bruce Willis, you will like HOSTAGE","This is a good hardcore action movie. The plot is a bit contrived and far fetched, but who cares."
2,No real substance ..,"I like Bruce Willis but he couldn't save this movie, even if he cried more. The plot was unoriginal and the script was laughable in some scenes. Above all i would have to say the acting was miserable, with the exception of Bruce W. The daughter and mother had no chemistry with Bruce Willis and they acted terribly. I think they should have hired better actors. This movie was wholly predictable. The little child in the film, the one who is supposed to be smart , was rather annoying and also a lousy actor."
2,Unbelievable!,"Hostage begins with an interesting premise: ie the former negotiator from a big city police dept seeks refuge as a small town police chief.However the movie quickly degenerates into mush, when we are shown a mansion with a multi-million dollar, Mission Impossible-style security system, and it can't even keep out acouple of hillbilly carjackers. The intent of security cameras is that you need someone(preferably security persons) watching them"
3,"not as good as die hard but better than 4, 5 others he did","to me this film was ""everything panict room was missing"" i like panic rooma nd it was so imular. panic room had 2 hostages, witha beaten up husband held by 3 mena crazy guys 1 was gun happy, 1 was just greedy one was acutally calm gentle evn though he too was bad. well hostage ""beaten up dad, 2 young kid hostages held by 3 young adult mean gang type kids. hostage i felt had little more to offer than panic room and i loved them both. this was better than murcury rising, 5th eliment 12 monkeys, but to me not as deep as 6 sense, I'm still waiing to se if ther will ever be a die hard 4 and th way hes ben doing thing liek hwo he died in armegedon, and 6 sense, i'd not b surpsie if he dies in die hard 4 or if it ends liek mel gibson ""CONSPERacy theary ""left for dead but you see him ina far away distacn as so calle people visit his so called grave sightwho knows"
5,Most underrated movie of the past four years,"I went and saw this movie in theaters because I saw Bruce Willis was in it, and it seemed good. I see my fair share of movies, and had never seen any preview for this film. I immediately LOVED it. I purchased it as soon as it came to DVD, and seeing it on Universal HD channel last night, and reminding me how good it really is, motivated me to come on here and write this review. I believe the downfall of this movie was insufficient marketing, but overall this is a well-acted, action-packed movie that takes place in one of my favorite parts of the country - mountainous southern California (which I believes add to the nostalgic attraction I have towards this movie).Overall, very good film, severely underrated, and if anyone wants a good Bruce Willis flick with a twisty, interesting plot and an eerie soundtrack, see Hostage."
4,I thought Hostage was good!,"I thought Hostage was an entertaining thriller, and you can't beat ben foster's death scene. one of the best death scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time."
4,"Taut, clever and brutal crime drama","Willis shines in this little film about a small town police chief and a hostage situation that keeps going wrong. The trio of stupid kids hold the wrong guy hostage as they soon discover this guy is hiding piles of money that doesn't belong to him. The owners of the money get Willis to get involved in finding a special DVD and the money or his own family gets whacked. Some clever plot twists, some good villians, some suspense and a nice shoot-out at the end wraps this one up. Fair film with some good scenes but I wouldn't suggest buying it, rent it. Willis is good as the desperate police figure but a few loose ends spoil it."
5,Great Willis Action Movie,"Wow. Right from the start of the movie, this movie is simply amazing. Even from the first scene when Bruce has to rescue a boy and the child's mom from a crazy man and it doesn't end so pleasantly. Everyone in this film is excellent. You really hate the bad guys of this movie and want them to get arrested or worse so badly. That means that these actors are really great to pull that emotion out of someone watching. It shows that there are young actors in Hollywood that can act. Willis is gives a great performance, as usual, as the hero of the film. The only downside to this movie is that it does have a couple of slow parts, but not many. Recommended to Bruce Willis fans for sure"
5,A complete movie,"Wow! I'm not sure how they did it, but they managed to pack in two 5-star villians who don't have anything to do with each other into the mix. And two heros, Bruce Willis' character and the little boy.Action, check. Music score, check. Sound effects, check. Make up and blood, check. Fire, oh yeah, plenty of it. Gunshots galore. Acting, ya it's there. Just look at Bruce Willis' face, it says it all.I won't spoil any of the story, but if you're into movies with hostage situations, this one's for you. From a psychotic troubled youth killer to a cold, calculating mastermind, there's enough to keep you watching. One of Bruce Willis' finest, guaranteed."
3,Huh??,"The movie is good no doubt but what is it about?.I mean Bruce Willis's family got kidnaped and held hostage by some corrupt FBI agents. His mission is to recover a ""DVD"" in a mansion where another mans family is being held hostage by some juvenile criminals.Other than saving the other mans family,what is this movie about?.What's on the DVD????"
2,Get the book instead...,I totally recommend reading the book by Robert Crais (5 stars in my opinion). I read it in 2 days and couldn't put it down. The movie doesn't even come close.
3,Big screenplay plot problems,"1. Audience doesn't care whether Talley's wife and daughter live or die. The wife doesn't love him much and the annoying daughter is a loser. Audience likes Walter Martin's kids much better.2. Three thugs are just too young and not inspiring fear. Even the silly stupid Mars was ludicrous as a madman. He just looked like a geek playing a mad man.3. Willis negotiating for money makes no sense as a ploy, and these black-booted thugs make no sense as to the lengths they'll go.It was not boring, I'll give it that. There was action. But I really wasn't inspired to give a damn whether Talley's wife lived or died in the end. I almost hoped they died and he'd go off on his own and start a Hostage trilogy.Just a ridiculous uninspiring premise."
2,Catch This One on DVD if You Must See It!,"I rarely ever give a movie less than four stars, but this one was filled with so many cliches that I couldn't resist. It started off interesting, but after the first 30 minutes I was ready to leave. I stayed through until the end and sadly nothing happened to improve my impression of the film. Bruce Willis was okay, but they had him in tears at least five times if not more. Hopefully Bruce will resurrect his career (the last piece of trash film he did was ""The Whole Ten Yards"") with Die Hard 4.0 which will be released in 2006. Trust me on this one and wait three months or so until ""Hostage"" swiftly goes to DVD."
3,ENTERTAINING... BUT WAY OVER THE TOP! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I like Bruce Willis and that is why I watched this film. The movie is slickly made and tension is high throughout. It's an good popcorn muncher that is entertaining, just don't think about it too long afterwards. It's not the worst action film off the year and it's good enough for a few rounds. The DVD transfer looks very good and there are a lot of extras to check out."
4,A very good film,"If you're looking for a action thriller that will keep your a** on the edge of your seat then check Hostage out.The film starts with a hostage situation that goes very wrong, devastated by the failed hostage situation Jeff Talley played by Bruce Willis transfers himself to no profile job as chief of police in a small town soon later 3 delinquent teenagers who follow a family home so they can steel their car but it gets out of hand and turns into a hostage situation but there's more to it than they all know.Hostage is a suspenceful action film with plenty of good moments in the film, think of this film as Die Hard meets Panic Room, the cast do a damn good job a special mention should go to Ben Foster who plays a very convinceing nutter you'll see what I mean when you watch it.I highly reconmend this film to anyone who's looking for a action thriller that will keep you on edge."
2,"Could have been a good book, if only there wasn't so many bad words!","I bet this book could have been good, if there wern't so many cuss words! They litterly said the ""f word"" at least four times on every page. To me, one or possibly two cuss words once in a while would be fine, but the Zoe Trope (the author) wrote SO MANY that it was distracting from the book. I finally had to stop reading because the bad words were so annoying and I forgot what the whole plot of the book was. All in all, if you are offended or annoyed by the use of cuss words, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT reccomend this book."
1,A bit disgusted...,"Honestly, I think Zoe is an okay writer. She uses some good imagery. But I don't know why I would ever want to waste my time reading about the 'horrible' life of a suburban middle-class high schooler. I am also suburban middle-class, but I don't publish books about it.The homosexual and bisexual parts truly disturbed me. I hear about that enough at the U, on the news, and everywhere else, I don't need to read a book about it.And I have to say, her hypocrisy overwhelmed me. People call her writing 'mature', but I say it's the farthest from. Her hate of everything and irrational liberal opinions only prove what happens to children's minds when they grow up in the 'burbs. She was wildly judgemental, which some people consider 'expressing opinions', but I got very annoyed with it after only a few pages.Through the whole book I just wanted to shout 'Get Over It Already!' at the top of my lungs."
1,Please Bury the Freshman Alive,"You do know you can get this kind of content for free, by reading the online journal of any given teenage girl, right? Hell, just go read her livejournal. I don't even know how one justifies the existence of this book: Given what's inside, you can't even give it to your grandfather who doesn't know how to use the internet(s)! Maybe the homeless will use this to keep themselves warm during Winter?Oh yeah, the writing is worthy of Abu Ghraib."
4,Certainly Not Warranting Such Negativity,"I read this book just over a year ago, and for me, it was emotional, poignant, and very personal. I'm not entirely sure where all the negativity towards this book comes from, but it is definitely unwarranted. I was recommended this book by a friend who is a fellow writer, and I couldn't put it down until I finished it.Simply put, I loved the book, and it is one of the books I recommend to my friends who need something new to read. If she wrote another book, I know I would buy it in a heartbeat."
2,I Loathe This Book but the Prose is Decent,"In all truth I loathe this book with the burning passion of a thousand dying suns. Admittedly the prose is very very good and if I, at fourteen, had written a memoir it would not have been written so elegantly. The reason the book makes me cringe is just the sheer self obsession of it, the all-pervading melodrama and the masturbatory navel gazing. In short, ghastly premise, very effective execution. I'm conflicted."
4,Different=Good,"I'm sure alot of you who read this were freaked out by Zoe's different style of writing. I think that is a great accoplishment of her to write a book AND get it published while she was in High School. I mean, to those of you who gave bad reviews, she was in High School. Unless you were/are one of those ""perfect"" students High School it's hell. Trying to fit in, understanding your classes, heck, it's hard enough just finding your classes. But this girl wrote a book. A book that got published and people actually read it. Many authors don't even start writing until they are in their middle twenties. Most of you were just scared becuase it was something different. I applaud her. She put effort into this book. And it was an awesome book. The story of what High School really feels like."
2,Ehh...,"I picked this book up at Borders without looking inside the book. The title caught my eye since I'm a freshman in HS. I haven't read the whole book yet, but I'm a little weirded out by this book. I can't relate at all to the homosexual issues and I don't really like the F word used in every sentence. It's an interesting book, but I'm not sure if I like the monotony in it. Like other's have said, I've read more interesting stuff at Livejournal and Xanga! I guess it's a good read if you don't have anything else to do..."
5,!!!,"Absolutely marvelous. A wondeful read, an honest voice a teenagefemale angst, love, lust, longing, and ultimately: young confusion.I'm sure the author will cringe when she's 35 and looks at whatshe wrote and published at...15!"
2,a joke?,"I agree with eric, If there was ever a need for evidence of why fourteen-year-olds should not be writing books, well, here it is.The book was so random and unorganized that there were several points were it was way too vague, and I found myself getting frustrated trying to decipher the plot and setting. Many entries took multiple times to read just to get the overall meaning of the situation. I also felt that Trope's all too common use of cuss words, such as the f-word was distracting from the book. Other times I became annoyed at the repetitiveness in the book. And her use of phrases to identify her friends instead of just false names wound up to confuse the reader more than anything.If you MUST read it, take it in small doses."
1,"No thanks, Zoe...","I'm very concerned about something. After reading ""Please Don't Kill the Freshman,"" I was left wondering how it got published. Sure, there's talent there. Zoe Trope has talent and she'd probably be wonderful writing poetry or an actual novel. The prose in the book isn't too bad, really. What bothers me is that she's just a hypocrite. She complains about how people make fun of her and shun her and her friends because they're different but then she turns around and does the same thing, makes fun of people simply because they are different from her. It's laughable. I think that Zoe Trope should definitely write something that actually uses her talent, not a whiny, high school journal."
2,Grade: C-,"I picked up Trope's book with high expectations. I read an interview with her on a website and my curiousity was piqued. I bought the book and finished it within a few hours. It was good, but not that good. There is no plot, the meanderings are meaningless, and the vocabulary is weak.The next ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" this ain't."
1,please kill zoe trope... i don't really care what happens to the freshman.,"GOD!!! this book is the most self-centered, angsty piece of sh** i have ever read. EVER. the whole thing reads like a love letter she wrote to herself. zoe's a normal fifteen-year-old, except NOT, 'cause she's DIFFERENT: she's a LESBIAN, she's LIBERAL, she's COOL. she spends her angst-ridden days looking down on everybody. it seems she has no kind words to say about anyone or anything throughout the novel, except for her secret love (her gay best friend - wait, i thought she was a LESBIAN?!). [...]"
4,Why not kill the freshmen?,"I bought this book because I'm in highschool and I hate it and because I want to be a writer. I gotta give Zoe credit for getting it published and actually writing the chapbook. The book is a little whiney in some places, though. The beginning is pretty good but then it starts to sound like it's all a pose. If you really hate highschool, don't expect to relate to this book."
1,This is just horrible,"Pretentious, self-absorbed, and very, very poor writing. Trying to be avante-gard? of course, but like so many others, it's almost embaressing. Not to mention she forgot to include the super-decoder-ring to understand her inane dialogue."
4,Take a closer look,"I picked up this book when I was running around a Barnes&Noble trying to find an interesting read. True, this book may be like the works of many teenage girls writing online diaries. But take a closer look. This is a memoir,this is an actual person's life not some fictional diary. She experiences pain and writes in a cryptic style. She is honest and truthful. Take from it what you will, like it or don't, but you just have to take a closer look decide whether or not this is the book for you. I liked it and I will be willing to keep it on my bookshelf. She is a talented writer, just not in a conventional way."
5,2-cup classic white tea pot,"When I received this item, it arrived with a broken lid. I called the seller directly and with no questions asked, they sent me out a new one (at no extra cost)and it arrived in excellent condition. I love this tea pot - it's perfect for one person, either with loose tea (I use a 2"" mesh tea ball) or with two tea bags. The ceramic material appears to be of very high quality and is smooth and lustrous - and it hasn't yet become discolored from brewing strong tea. This is a great product."
2,Too Small,"I had ordered this as a two-cup teapoit. When it arrived and I saw how small it was, I then measured it. It was a little over one cup and I wanted it to hold two cups. It's really very cute, but not useful."
2,Buddyblowjob...,"I find it extremely amusing that the dudes from buddyhead keep trying to cram this cd down everyone's throat's. In magazines or on their site it's always burning brides this burning brides that. If it weren't for the fact that these dudes are on their label and promoting the album will bring them all money they'd make fun of them and give em a bad ""axel"" review along with the many other bands they sound like. I give BB credit for trying to keep rock going strong but most of the songs sound the same. Also, I think it's a little ""cliche"" to have a female bassist. I suggest an actual Nirvana album rather than this generic version."
4,For the nay-sayers,Here's a tip for all those that rip this CD and this band. See them live. They will blow you away. The tightly produced sound on this album gives way to loud abusive and all out rockin' live music. I like this album but love them live more.
3,3.5 stars,"the music is in the vein of the vines/hives/white stripes but it is a little more diverse. elements of grunge ala nirvana and of course the pop aspect which is why i am surprised they have not had more radio success.ultimately this a well done rock meets pop album but they do crank out the garage rock quite excellently which make this one great, fun and well executed album. give it a whirl and let me know what you think"
2,yawn,"The Burning Brides play a repetetive mix of garage rock, alternative, and metal that quickly gets old. Don't get me wrong, ""Plank of Fire,"" ""If I'm a Man,"" and the poppy ""Artic Snow"" are all really good songs and hint at the potential this band has, but the rest of the songs on this album sound too much alike and even the shorter ones seem to drone on forever. Here's hoping their next album will be better."
4,Listen to this,"Burning Brides have a unique sound that will keep this in your CD player with the volume turned up. In many ways it sounds like Unwritten Law, so if you like them then you will like Burning Brides. The only problem is the vocals can be hard to hear sometimes, that's why they don't have perfect score of 5 stars, other than that, this is a great album by a great band."
2,Lack of content. More of a refence book.,"This is NOT the book you should buy if you are looking for a concise teaching of Rhino from beginner to advance. It is more of a reference book that explores the tools of Rhino further. It more or less compliments the user guide that comes with the software. Very technical, not the book for any organic modeling tips.This book mainly covers all the tools inside Rhino, and teaches you what it does. What you do with it, is up to you. You are better off sticking to the tutorials on the Rhino CD, or via their website."
3,"OK, but not great","As some of the other reviewers mentioned, this book is lacking in some critical details. I am only about 120 pages into it and have found some parts to be very confusing, particularly when it comes to the sequence of operations. Unfortunatly there are not many books about Rhino so I felt cornered into buying it. Do not pay full price to get a new one. I paid $8.00"
4,easy to follow instructions a good start to Rhino,"Have been using this book for about 6 hours now. I notice a few ommissions in the directions, a couple of typos, too. But basicaly this is a great book. The CD comes with a demo version of Rhino 2 which allows for 25 saves. I do not know what happens after you use the 25 saves.There are good step by step instructions for making a couple of items like a VW beetle, a joystick for game control, and a telephone. I will be ready to move on to another book rather quickly after this, for some more sophisticated stuff. But I forsee this book continuing to be a good reference for operating the commands."
3,Pissed off.,Did not come with the gaskets like it says. I do not want to ship it back just to get a gasket this is frustrating and a waste of my time. May be good but I can not use it in the condition it was sent.Hedman 36030 Integra/Gsr Only 94-95
5,You MUST buy this movie!,"This is one of the most action packed/stunt filled movies ever filmed. This film takes no prisoners, and pulls no stops, and the ending leaves you breathless. While most of Rothrock's movies are far under par, she does have a few decent HK films, this one being the best; and Yuen having his greatest fight scenes since Dragon's Forever(co-starring J. Chan). This has my vote for greatest action movie of all time!"
4,Action Packed!,"I saw this film last year at Montreal's Fant-Asia film festival. Although some of the scenes with Cynthia Rothrock were a little cheesy, overall, this was a very enjoyable movie. Yuen Biao is always fun to watch."
1,A poor design | do not buy,We bought this to be able to use a tea maker we had bought oversees. The 3ooo W unit did not last for than a couple of months and we had no success with the manufacturer or Amazon to get another unit or refund.Unhappy customer.
4,Step UP/DOWN or just a stabilizer?,"Like another reviewer, I too thought this may only be a stabilizer when I opened the package. (I bought the similar but lower-rated Simran AR-350.) The package only refers to the stabilizing functions, saying something like ""converts 75-140 V to 110 or 175-250 V to 220"". However, my voltmeter shows that it does, indeed step-up 110 to 220 and I'm happily using mine on 110 V to power a 220V device."
1,Voltage Stabiliser only. Not a convertor from 110 to 220v.,"This product does not convert voltage from 110v to 220v. Well, the catlog does seem to mislead. The seller should rather mention that this is only a stabiliser in the local voltage region and does not step up from 110 to 220 or step down from 220 to 110.Hmmmm... Just wasting my shipping charges to the tune of 27$.Don't know how much I will lose for a return shipping.Waste of time and money."
3,Something Is Missing,"If you get this, and I do recommend it, be prepared for something missing. A number of scenes are missing from this DVD. They even show you flashbacks to scenes that were NOT even shown. They even cut out the entire opening scene of the last episode 'The Sign of Four' tells you what is going on. I love Sherlock Holmes and I was thrilled to now have Sherlock Homes in the 22nd Century in my collection, but I feel cheated that DIC believed that they didn't need to include the entire show. So be warned, if you don't understand what is going on, or how someone knew something, blame DIC."
5,excellent!,I'm an old Holmes fan and I'm proud to say this is a very enjoyable program. Unfortunately there are only a few episodes available for purchase. I wish the entire series were on DVD.
4,DVD? Maybe?,"How about someone brings the Complete Series to DVD...you know, so those of us who want to OWN it and watch it whenever they want without clogging up their computer can have it too."
4,Moya does it again.,Moya as done it again. Smooth Celtic sound and calming effect to my weary heart at the end of a long day. Nothing soothes the anger and stress within me like Moya and her music.
5,Maire/Moya Changes Her Look...For the Best?,"This CD is definetly different from her other four, but is very good. It is a nice change, and I like it. It uses more upbeat music. I wish she would have sang more than one song in Gaelic though. Anyway, worth the money definetly!!!!!!!!"
4,"Two Horizions, Music, Irish",A very nice collection of Irish music. A beautiful voice and nice arrangements.
5,This work is a must read!,"Gomez has done a tremendous service to the study of Africana by giving tangible evidence to what have heretofore been the answers rather than the questions on the who, what, where, when and WHY's of the African slave in America. Readers will be surprised at the degree to which something other than fact has helped form the base of their ""knowledge"". Suddenly the image of tobacco or rice will gain greater resonance than cotton. Virginia and Senegambia, for example, will have new and sharper meanings as we better ferret out who we were as Ghanaians, Senegambians, Angolans, etc. and how we became who we are as African-Americans."
3,Not just cute little babies....,"I assumed that all Anne Geddes books were full of adorable pictures of uncomfortable-looking babies. I bought this book online as a gift for my Grandma for Christmas. I wrapped the book before looking through it, and was more than shocked on Christmas morning when my Grandma was flipping through her brand new book and saw a lot more than babies!! While the photography is stunning, please be warned that nude adults are included in this particular collection. I was also disappointed that the pictures were rather small. Overall, the pictures were beautiful but the book was not quite what I expected."
5,Anne Geddes must be an angel herself...or a magician!,"In a recent interview, Ms Geddes said that her pictures of new-borns and older babies are 99.99% un-computer-inhanced! How can that be?! She must truly be an angel herself...or a magician, or both :-)"
5,Great gift,"I gave this to a pregnant friend, and she absolutely LOVED it. I actually spent an hour pouring over the pages and the notes in the back before I gave it to her. It is an excellent book, although it is a little small (probably about 8 inches tall)."
5,A book for all ages,"I recieved this book as a gift. I love children, I believe they are our greatest asset, so does Anne Geddes. The natural poses, the ability to catch innocence at its best is amazing. My teenagers loved the book and so did their older grandparents. The pictures will stir a number of emotions from tears to smiles. It brought back many memories of my children as infants. This book is an outstanding investment for someone you love or anyone one who loves children."
5,Terrific recipes tied to fascinating personal life events.,"Brian Cummings makes time in the kitchen a treat with recipes that are truly terrific. Taking time to sit down while the pot comes to a boil is a good time to read the ""life events"" that make every recipe even more enjoyable to prepare. The proof is in the eating -- savor the moment!"
1,anything Michael Lerner compiles is a pile,"Liat Weingart gave this book five stars, as ""birds of a feather"" agree on the ""best"" comtemporary Jewish writing. What is so shocking is that both of these people work long and hard to destroy the Jewish State, undermine their economy, and rally for a one state solution and it will not be Israel. For self loathing Jews, these stories are great. Zionsts, save your buck fifty (used) and buy a latte at Starbucks."
2,Made in China poor welds,[[ASIN:B000L9THC2 COWIN GLOBAL Wire Security Truck] This cart was shipped and when received it had broken welds and the front latch had sharp edges. The shelf was bent and the welds were broken on the edge of the frame when I installed it. Rust was showing on the bottom. Will not buy another as this came from China and had rough edges on the frame. Will buy USA made next time.
5,Don't read the afterward!,"It's a good--maybe even great--story cycle, but good lord, do yourself a favour and assiduously avoid reading the horribly arrogant and obnoxious afterward, in which Resnick basically lists all the awards the stories have won, along with fairly unpleasant commentary--this story WOULD have won the hugo, except that it was disqualified on a technicality. This one, too, would have won, except that another story of mine did instead. And the only thing capable of defeating a Resnick story is another Resnick story! God, I made the mistake of looking through this drivel before finishing the stories, and it really colored my whole perception of them. Oh well."
3,Kindle version flawed,"The Kindle version of the book contains frequent errors which appear to be the result of the OCR software that was used to produce the Kindle file. Bursts of inappropriate characters (such as ""rvY}"" at the end of some italicized phrases) are common, as are incorrect words elsewhere in the text. This happens often enough to be distracting and to interrupt the flow of the story. The conversion software seemed to find the italicized word ""mundumugu"" difficult, and it tacked on various inappropriate characters, first noticed midway into chapter 2, ""For I Have Touched the Sky.""This is the only Kindle book with which I've encountered this kind of problem, yet I'm hesitating to order any further Mike Resnick books in Kindle format, because it is probable that they too were produced by the same flawed conversion process.For the time being, I'll purchase traditional books when looking for another Mike Resnick story.I rate the story itself as average."
1,tedious,"Resnick is a hit-and-miss author, sometimes cute, and sometimes too befuddled by his attempts to be clever and cute. His Kirinyaga series is essentially tedious, politically correct, and frequently inane. It tells the story of a tribe that revolts against modern ways. Its witch doctor delivers simplistic homilies and everyone who thinks progress should go beyond the 15th century is evidently a fool and a knave. Don't waste your time on this tedious, rather inane series."
2,they sound good,"I had my new pipes installed and found out that the first 8 inches or so are single wall pipe. They colored in the first 10 miles. They were installed with brand new compression gaskets. They sound great, so i just have to live with the coloration at the beginning of pipes."
4,The song WATERSHIP DOWN by AMERICA,"Just a little note:GERRY BECKLEY & the group AMERICA wrote a song for this movie, titled Watership Down. It was never used in the movie. AMERICA released the song on an LP titled HIDEAWAY. It is truly the best & does an outstanding job in conveying the emotions of the movie. It is worth a listen & you will not understand why it was not used in the movie. GERRY BECKLEY wrote it, George Martin produced it, AMERICA & GERRY BECKLEY performed it. The best !!!"
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"First, the movie is far better than the novel it is based on. The only thing that stands out in my memory from the novel that isn't clear in the movie is that in Efrafa the biggest rabbit is chief, so when Bigwig mentions his chief, the Efrafan leader assumes Bigwig's chief is even bigger and more powerful than Bigwig. (There, now you can skip the book.)Next, I would honestly put this movie on a list of the best along with Casablanca, Forrest Gump and other greats.Finally, having had one house rabbit before and another one now, I may be biased. However, I think the story works even better in this case with the rabbit point of view than a similar story would from a human pov."
2,"Violent, Grim, & Shallow = Bad Movie","This is obviously not a children's movie, so I'm judging it by adult standards. It is quite violent, relentlessly grim, and not terribly creative. The story is basically that of the struggle for freedom, but the characters and the plot are so shallow that the movie would be boring if it wasn't so depressing and bloody. I did, however, like the background mythology and the way the rabbit behavior was animated.I'm unsure why this movie has received such rave reviews. I can only assume that it is from people who have read the book and are projecting its quality onto the screen adaptation. The book may be a classic, but this movie certainly is not."
3,watership down,"Interesting movie, i felt that there were a few things missing from the book.Absolutely not a child's dvd. does show violence and a sadness. I did enjoy it though."
3,Watered Down Watership Down,"This is based on Richard Adams' novel, which is probably one of the best books I've ever read. It provides insights into the meaning of life through the seemingly simple lives of rabbits. They have their own society, their own hiearchy, and--most intriguingly--their own religion. It is interesting, then, to note that it is the religion that the writers/producers chose to remove (censor?) from the film version. The relgious aspects give another dimension into these rabbits' lives, and therefore, somewhat of an insight into our own lives. The film itself is animated in the non-Disney like fashion of 1978, but the voices are well-done and include such talents as Nigel Hawthorne <ASIN: B00005AUJT> and Zero Mostel <ASIN: B0000CBY1B>. It's a very good film, but do yourself a favor and read the book!"
4,Excellent.,"Unlike some novels that are converted into videos, they managed to make this one enjoyable. Just a small warning- despite the rabbit characters and bright art, this is definetely not a children's video. For example, during Holly's recount of what happened after he and some other rabbits left the warren, there is a very haunting scene that creeped even me out (for a little while, at least, ^-^;). Oh, and Art Garfunkel sings the song, Bright Eyes. Yay!"
4,A Must-See,"We need more animated films like this today. I remember seeing this on TV during my pre-teen years, I think, and was quite impressed with its realism, symbolism and message. I remember being amazed that a ""cartoon"" could convey so much social relevence. Keep in mind that I was raised in the Roadrunner/Woody Woodpecker era, which offered nothing but mindless comic violence and guffaws, which are good, but ... I would recommend parents, especially parents these days, to watch this show with their children and talk about it afterward. It's very good."
5,Timeless tale of hope and love,"I grew up with this movie and have loved it for a very long time. After our father died, my brother and I watched this film and it touched us in a way that it hadn't before. Watership Down is told from the persective of rabbits, but the rabbits are symbolic for mankind. And the story centers around a particulr group of rabbits who struggle through death, persection, and misery to find a place where they can live in peace. The ending still makes me cry, and this beautiful tale of a small group of rabbits who do, in the end, find what they are looking for, will touch and comfort those who are grieving. I recommend this film with all my heart!"
2,Disappointing,"I just recently read the book and watched the movie, and I was disappointed at how they added useless bits and took away important ones. First of all, there was never a rabbit named Violet, and near the end of the book, it is stated that none of the original rabbits had died. They took away the part about the hutch rabbits, and how they escape. They totally skipped a major character, Strawberry. And they failed to elaborate at all about the Efrafans and their way of life. I seriously do not see how anybody who has not read the book could possibly understand the movie, seeing as it totally missed half of the details."
4,great movie,"This would have been five stars if they would have included my favorite character from the book, El-ahrairah. It's a pretty violent movie and sometimes hard to know what the characters are saying, but other than that it's good."
5,Watership Down DVD,"I bought this DVD as a supplement to the text of Watership Down. I intend to use this with eighth-grade language arts students. I haven't had an opportunity to do so yet, but I have viewed the DVD myself. I am really excited about it. I think it represents the book very well. It is also beautifully animated. I am eager to use it with my classes next year. I would reccomend this DVD as an addition to any classroom."
4,A Classic,"Although it feels a bit outdated, it still is a very good story and animation for its time. I would be interested in seeing it updated with new animation, but this production should be available to sell other than being discontinued. It motivates me to revisit the book."
1,NOT FOR KIDS!!!,"Do not let your children see this movie until they are at least 10. My daugther watched this movie as a child and I regret letting her see it to this very day. It is intensely graphic and visual. True, the plot is good, BUT IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! She has had countless nights where she couldn't fall asleep because she would invision the head evil rabbit leering down upon her. The movie has way to many details about how the rabbits died.It shows them spiraling into death, taking their last gasps for air as they die. Please, for your child's sake, don't let them watch this movie until they are ready for it."
1,Do not show kids,This may look like a kids film because it has cartoon rabbits. It is not for kids. I saw this film thinking it was a kids film and was shocked at the terrible things this showed. This film is PG not G and should have been PG-13. This film started off good with rabbits looking for a new field. If it would have ended when the rabbits good to field it would be decent. After it gets into a disturbing scenes of rabbits brudaly murdering other rabbits with there claws showing flesh and blood. It has for blood than some war films. Seeing this bloody film made my younger sister cry. Some R rated films are more kid friendly than this horrific film. Warning don't let your kids see this.
1,Save your money,"I read the book and loved it, bought the movie and hated it. I would not have immagined they could have messed up such a wondeful story so much but they did. I reccomend you read the books and forget about this movie."
1,Bloody - Not suitable for children,"Although this is a cartoon (animation), it is not suitable for children. It is graphic(bloody)in showing the violent death of rabbits. In no way do I believe this belongs related to family or children catagories!"
1,When cartoons are ruined by too much of one element....,"""Watership down"" could've been a great cartoon..sadly,it was completely ruined by an overkill of drama.I was VERY disappointed in ""Watership Down""...the constant drama ruined the fun for me,and I finally stopped watching it,unable to stay focused and completely bored by it.No action,no comedy,no suspense,no adventure,no romance...just drama.That's it.Also,this is NOT for children.Advice:If you want a GOOD drama,tape soap operas off your TV."
3,"Not the book, but not too bad","I absolutely LOVE this book. I've read it dozens of times- had to buy a new copy since I wore out the first one I had. I saw there was a movie, and I was so excited to see it. I finally got to watch the movie, and I was a little disappointed in it. The animation wasn't bad, and the voices were well done, but the beautiful story was butchered. It was probably enough of the story line for someone who had never read the book to make it a cute story, but for someone who loves the book as much as I do I wish they had followed the story a little more. I wanted Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Dandelion, Silver, Buckthorn, Strawberry, Captain Holly, Bluebell, and Blackberry to become the rabbits I loved in the book, and the movie just never got me there. A decent movie, but I recommend the book more."
3,Fun but light,"I enjoyed reading this but it's a much more superficial treatment of the subject matter than I hoped it would be, and Greenfeld at times seems overly impressed with his lifestyle. The chapter on the riots after the krismon in Jakarta (where Greendfeld writes about another person's experience, rather than his own) is far and away the best part of the book."
1,AppleCare Don'tCare,I'm struggling to understand the value of the Applecare product. When do do eventually get to speak to someone they end up giving you incorrect information that has left me out of pocket and more than a little hacked off.With so many more smart phones coming on the market I think it's time Apple woke up and got off their high horse.
5,A MUST-HAVE for all Apple products!,"The AppleCare Protection Plan is a wonderful thing for any Apple product. The best thing of all is that you have an ENTIRE YEAR to purchase it after you buy your Apple product. PC manufacturers usually REQUIRE you to purchase the warranty at the time of purchase or you don't get a warranty at all. Apple gets five stars for this AppleCare because it is a VERY good price for a three year warranty. Besides, when do Apples crash? HARDLY EVER! However, with all electronics, there is always the possibility of a fluke happening and in case you get one, AppleCare will get it taken care of and you have nothing to worry about. Yet again, Apple amazes me."
2,Don't count on a replacement battery,"For whatever reason I was led to believe I would at least get a replacement battery from the applecare program when my first one ran out of juice. That's not the case though, only if its defective will they give you a new one."
1,"Cute, but poor quality","I bought this dress for my 11-month old (who wears 12 mos). The dress was way too big, and one of the gold buttons fell off on our way to get her pictures taken! After I washed it, the navy blue bow fell off, and two more buttons came off as well. It is an adorable dress, but Save Your Money."
2,cape is longer than outfit,"I received my product rather quickly after placing my order. I am 5'6"" and I found the outfit too short. My cape was longerthan the dress. I did not like the feel of the velvety material."
5,Great Product,"Works great and a good value. One end is stiff to get you started, and the middle is thicker to grab the food boogers from under my bridge. Just what I needed! I'll be buying more of these!"
1,Horrible textbook,"Reads like a dictionary, each page is nothing more than bullet points that alternate between definitions and corollaries. Proofs are typically very short: explained and illustrated in no more than a quarter of a page. More appropriate as a reference manual than a textbook for a class."
2,not recommended,"This book was used for my undergraduate course in introductory graph theory, which was split between math and computer science students. I found that this book left to be desired. The definitions are imprecise and often inconsistent with those that are standard, and much of the notation used is not standard. I would not recommend this book as a reference or for advanced students."
4,Getting Wisdom,"""Get Wisdom,"" a phrase from the Hebrew Bible, advises us to pursue wisdom above all else. If wisdom is to be found in a text, you will find it in this compendium which contains selected texts and quotations from the Bible, ancient philosophy, native American culture, Eastern religions and modern English poetry. The volume also contains illustrations that portray wisdom pictorially. As useful and inspirational as the quotations are, so also are Hickey's introductions which precede each separate set of readings and which, in my opinion, are worth the price of the book by themselves. Perhaps one day, the author will write a personal account of his own search for Wisdom. In any case, GET WISDOM is highly recommended."
2,Disappointed,"Normally, I recommend Examples & Explanation series over any of the other commerical outlines out there. I was very disappointed with both Constitutional Law books however. The examples are unhelpful, especially when a lot of the answers depend on material you won't learn for several chapters! Some of the text is useful but much of it is the authors biased view of what cases mean or should mean. This isn't helpful if you are not taking the class from them!Overall, I was extremely disappointed in these two books. Not worth the money."
1,"horrible transfer, and bad subtitles","This review is for the DVD, not the film. This DVD transfer (by Facets Multimedia) is one of the WORST I have ever seen: the colors are washed out, the image is blurry with tons of artifacts, and there are frequent flickers--it actually blinks from one color to another and then back again! They also letterboxed the film in a 4:3 ratio instead of showing it in its original, widescreen ratio.On top of that, the subtitle translation is not idiomatic English; there are many awkward phrases to the point of distraction. There is even a five-minute (!) advertisement preceding the main movie. It's shameless that the distributor would even put a product like this out. So unfortunate that they botched this film by a key director of Iranian new wave cinema. If you must, rent the movie but do NOT buy this DVD!"
5,EaZy-duz-it again,This is an amazing cd by the late eazy-e. He is the best at what he does his music will live on forever.This cd shows what telent eazy-e had. This cd plain kicked my ass it was that good. I think whoever likes rap and doesn't have this or any NWA or eazy-e doesn't really like rap.This cd is a classic and it will live on forever. RIP EaZy-E (Eric Wright)
3,Eazy-Duz-It,"Released just after the ""Straight Outta Compton"", the first solo release from NWA is as much of a mixed bag as hip-hop albums get. While just as lyrically profane as the group effort, ""Eazy-Duz-It"" focuses more on sexual humor than street-gangster tales. And while Eazy was probably the most recognizable voice of the bunch, he was also probably the worst rapper. Still, despite the lack quality lyrical content, Dr. Dre provides Eazy with funky radio friendly hits that almost make up for it."
1,poop dog?,I was gonna buy all the eazy-e collection. every cd/mp3 album for christmas. but they got the f@880t Snoop doggie dogg on there.come on. i aint buying nothing that has to do with poop dog
3,this is the best cd!,i think everyone should have this cd its so awesome!!the lyrics are good and unlike a lot of rap you can understnad the words!!!
3,"B.O.A.T, BEST OF ALL TIME !","WELL FOR ONE I NEVER DID LIKE OLD HIP HOP MUSIC,IT WAS TO BOGUS,BUT EAZY-E WAS THE ILLEST RAPPER I HEARD BACK IN THE 80'S AND EARLY 90'S.HE WAS THE BEST OF ALL TIME.BUY THIS ALBUM, EAZY-E ALONE IS A CLASSIC."
5,Gangsta Rap at its finest!!!!,"Eazy E what can I say about him nothing that he was just straight up blunt and that he told it like it was on the streets of compton and the lifestyle he is just telling it like it is and guess what I loved the way he told it in his music this is a classic I would recommend anyone who likes old school rap music to buy this album because it a clasic a must have because this album contains all of the classics from back in the day.My favorites are just about every song on this album I love We want Eazy, Eazy Duz It, Dope Man, Radio, Still Talking**** , Nobody Move Nobody Gets Hurt, Fat Girl on My Jock, and many other classic oldies !!!!"
5,Classic material from Eazy,"Eazy-E has never been exceptional on the mic. He didn't even write his own lyrics, but there was just something about him you loved. Maybe it was his voice, or the way he delivered those lyrics. Whatever it was, it is on full effect Eazy-Duz-It. The album plays exactly like Straight Outta Compton, and if you like that, you're gaurenteed to like this. The production is the same kind of sound, and of course you get crazy hilarious lyrics from Eazy-E. One of the reasons the rap world misses him so much. R.I.P. Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright"
4,Classic gangsta-rap album,"To call Eazy-E the best rapper of all time would be an exaggeration. His mic-skills were usually nothing impressive, but he could catch wreck sometimes. He was at his personal best when MC Ren was rhyming alongside him. The strength of Eazy-Duz-It isn't Eazy's lyrics, but Dr. Dre's funky beats.If you're into gangsta-rap or if you are an Eazy-E fan, then this album is an essential. If you don't like gangsta-rap, then don't buy it. This is a classic gangsta-rap album.R.I.P Eazy"
4,There are lots of modern harmony folk/pop acts...,"..and some of them have as many good songs as The Ditty Bops. But what sets this record apart is that they decided not to go minimal. They found the right group of back-up musicians and concentrated on the arrangements and...this is key...decided to keep the drums! Lots of acoustic acts do away with percussion. The result is a really polished production, with the hooks, melodies and harmonies...some really atmospheric soulful music. Their voices and compositions are really clever and mystical/sweet. A real keeper, and it grows on you. The second half of the album definitely fades away in quality though."
5,Short and sweet,"They Might Be Giants, if the guys became women who could actually sing and play predominantly acoustic instruments. Not to knock TMBG, pop icons that they are, but it's like they just got outfoxed by the Indigo Girls at their own game.Yes, that means buy this album."
1,Don't-y Bops,"Sit around in your living room with your friends sometime, just kind of noodle with some songs, tell some jokes, put on a funny hat or two. Somebody will no doubt say ""Gee, you guys should think about recording a CD!"" This is what happened to the Ditty Bops, and as fate would have it, they listened to their friends and said ""Gee, OK!"" Holy Cripes!!! I couldn't return this CD to the library fast enough! What is played among friends should sometimes stay in the living room. Listening to the commentators on NPR radio is more fun than this. Nothing to get excited about here, folks. Pass it by...."
1,WOW>>>THIS SUCKS,"I ordered this because I love Dresden Dolls and this was supposed to sound like them... This sucks though, too poppy and folky... GAG"
4,What A Find!,"This turned out to be another gem I stumbled across! Not to sure where I'd place these gals in the musical spectrum. But it's witty, charming, great harmonies, and just an overall cool feel to it. If you need something completely different to let your ears stroll through, check this 'ditty' out."
5,Best new music!,"I saw the music video to Wishful Thinking on LOGO's New Now Next, and fell in love with them immediately. I bought the album and found every song to be pure genious!"
5,The Ditty Bops,"I saw this band open up for Tori Amos on her Summer of Sin tour and was impressed with their performance so I purchased the album rigth away. They produce what I like to refer to as ""feel good"" songs and theire style is origial and unique. Highly recommended to someone looking for something new to listen to."
5,The Ditty Bops,"We saw them live with Tori Amos. They are phenomenal! Totally original, a fresh new sound that keeps your feet tapping to the last note. I highly recommend this CD."
4,The Ditty Bops,Great 30's type music with more modern lyrics written by the performers. Something a little different and good fun!
5,Just plain damn fun,"If you are a fan of The Roches or Kate & Anne McGarrigle, you will love these gals. I've seen others compare them to old style jazz or some other retro movement (whatever!) . I feel that this is just good, clean sounding pop, with wonderful harmonies. This winter, when you have a day that looks like it might be the beginning of Spring, pop in this disc, roll down the windows, stick a smile on your face and turn up the jams. (In fact, this disc might just make the Sun come out)."
2,Not a fine product,"The lamp shows good in the picture but when look at close distance, the tiffany glass pieces are not made in good quality at all; they are full with small bumps, not a smooth surface I had expected. The glass does not have the transparent feeling at all. If I were asked to guess what kind materials it is, I would defiantly say (final answer) it's plastic. May be the quality was good years ago? Anyway, I would not buy it had I known this. The base is pretty sturdy though."
2,don't waste your money!!,"It looks great in the picture! It is 100% plastic! I have never felt so ripped off. The lamp also came coated with a thick layer of oil that took an hour to clean, and it still smelled."
3,Feels like plastic,"These lamps feel like they are made out of plastic not glass. I love the design, but i have other Tiffany lamps and they look and feel like glass. These really do not look like glass and have a thick coating of something waxy on them that will not wash off. These were very expensive and I wrote the company right after getting them and told them all these things but never even heard back. To send them back was very expensive also, and was afraid to since I never heard back from the company."
2,"MARGINAL QUALITY ""MADE IN CHINA""","THIS IS ALL WE CAN EXPECT THIS DAYS FROM PRODUCTS SENT OFF TO CHINA FOR THE GREEDY SAKE OF PROFIT . I HAVE OWNED TWO QUIOZEL CHANDELIERS IN THE PAST ,MADE IN USA, AND THE WERE OF HIGH QUALITY AND ACTUALLY LEAD SOLDER AT EVERY SEAM. THESE LAMP SHADES ARE PARTIALLY LEAD SOLDERED AND THEN GLUED TOGETHER AT THE MAJOR SEAMS RESULTING IN IN THE GLUED SEAMS SEPARATING IN SHIPMENT DUE TO THE HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE DELIVERY VEHICLES. BOTH WERE THIS WAY. DID I SEND THEM BACK ? NO. I JUST SUPER GLUED THE SEAMS. IT WAS A LOT EASIER THAN REPACKING AND RETURNING.!!! WAKE UP AMERICA JUST DON'T BUY PRODUCTS FROM AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT HAVE SOLD US OUT TO CHINA FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR BOTTOM LINE!!!! IF IT SAYS ""MADE IN CHINA"" IT IS LIKELY PURE JUNK.Quoizel Indus Tiffany 2 Lt Table Lamp"
1,I'd be embarassed...,"This is one of the worst-written books I have ever started to read (no, I'm not going to finish it). It is so full of fundamental grammatical errors that it's astounding. How did something this bad ever get published?"
4,Silver Streak is a damn funny movie,the team of Wilder and Pryor never disappoints. True to form they are a hilarious duo. Action packed and hilariously funny there never is a dull moment.
5,The Silver Streak,One of Gene Wilder's best movies and you will laugh through the whole movie. It's just one mishap after another. It also has a good cast for the characters.
5,Amazon Came Through!,My sister tried various outlets searching for this film. She wanted it as a special gift for a friend. I suggested Amazon and..there it was. It has provided many hours of enjoyment for her friend. For that reason we give both Amazon and Silver Streak five stars.
2,watch yhou order,"I thought I ordered a dvd, it came vhs, can't use this anymore, will be returning item for exchang, good movie if I could watch it"
4,Another train movie,"In my opinion, the train is the star of the movie. For those who love trains and train travel, you can't beat the fun and intrigue along the way of this star-studded movie."
4,Silver Streak,"George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) is taking a passenger train, named Silver Streak, from L.A. to Chicago and meets a romantic secretary onboard named Hilly Burns (Jill Clayburgh). While George is in bed he sees through his window a dead man falling off the train. While trying to solve the murder and prevent anyone else from being hurt he is thrown off the train. Later he manages to get back on.The movie has several funny moments and I liked Hilly the secretary. One of my favorite lines is: ""I know what goes where, and why."""
2,DVD reproduction is too dark,"I am a huge fan of this film. I was greatly disappointed with the DVD version, however. Many of the scenes that are on the train, and in less than full sunlight, are much too dark. I was hoping to recapture some of the neat photography with the widescreen version (some is lost with the full screen VHS version) on a projection TV. Only those scenes that showed the outdoor panorama of the train passing was fully captured with the DVD.I like the show, but I can't recommend this DVD."
5,Silver Streak is on the right track for comedy & Thrills,All Aboard!!!!!Silver Streak is on the right track with comedy& thrills.Gene wilder plays george caldwell.A book editor who decides to take the train to work on his latest book.Here he meets the gorgeous hilly burnsplayed by jill clayburgh.After a chance encounterThe two have dinner together.After a romantic meal the tipsy couple retire totheir quarters for some Love makingDuring their Canoodeling George spots a dead bodyFall past The window..This starts off a wild series of eventsthat george gets caught up in.This film is one of my all time favesIts about time 2oth century Fox released this gemon DVDHopefully in its correct aspect ratio& with a plethora of bonus goodies!!get a move on fox!!!!Its A well known & extremely funny film that still holds upon Reapeted viewingsi've worn out my copys!!!
5,Hilarious,"I love this movie, I know it is old but all of Richard Pryor movies are all so funny and a good movie to keep you laughing."
4,Silver streak review,Silvr streak was for my old lady she likes it a lot tries to watch it everyday. I dont mind it Pyor and wilder are a good comedy team together. But i thought Gene wilder was better with Clevon little in Blazing Saddles which i have a copy of also.Another nice addition to my movie collection. Ialso reccomend it.
4,Pryor Jumpstarts Comedy-Thriller,"""Silver Streak"" is an important film in the sense that it is the first film that ""mainstreamed"" Richard Pryor. Previously, Pryor was best known for his work on comedy albums, concerts, and ""blaxploitation"" films. I was thirteen when this film came out and it was an impetus for me to seek out Pryor's other rawer, more verboten body of work. Needless to say this was the first film to team Pryor with Gene Wilder and the chemistry they had was priceless. As for the film, the mixture of thriller and comedy is for the most part sucessful. Once Pryor enters the fray at the film's halfway mark it's like a shot of adrenaline. I attribute the film's sluggish first half to mediocre director Arthur Hiller. Patrick McGoohan's suave villainy is also a major plus here. A good supporting cast (Ned Beatty, Ray Walston, Scatman Crothers, Richard Kiel) is on hand here. Jill Clayburgh, who proved to be an able actress in subsequent films, is basically just on hand here as eye candy."
4,Classic Comedy,"I recently bought Silver Streak on DVD to watch on my laptop while on a cross-country train trip. Even though the clothes and hair styles date this movie, it's still as funny as it was when first released. Classic Gene Wilder / Richard Pyror comedy that one never tires of watching."
5,love this one,I love this movie so much. Gen Wilder is fantastic and Richard Pryor is hilarious. Don't know why more people don't know about it. Maybe because it's older. It is one of my favorite Gene W. movies for sure. If not THE favorite.
5,An all time classic,"This comedy-mystery has it all: humor, romance, mystery, murder. Wilder and Pryor are a fantastic duo that play off of each other to make for pure entertainment!"
5,Best train comedy.,"This is my favorite Gene Wilder comedy. I just love movies that take place on a train. -I don't know why, but there's something about the isolation and confinement of a train-ride. You're trapped, in a way. Whatever, there's plenty of action on this route, and Wilder gets more than he bargained for. Richard Pryor is also genius in this, one of the best comedies of the 70's. I love it, I love, I love it !."
3,what is good varies in the beholders eye,"probably a waste of time commenting on a movie that is so liked by so many. i am very pleased to have it in my video library but for reasons than otherwise stated in most of the reviews. the only way i can watch this movie is if i fast forward and watch only the scenes that contain patrick mcgoohan. he adds so much to a movie that is lacking in so many ways, his character makes the movie and there would be no movie if roger d. was not included. most of the actors seem to be just putting in their days work. hopefully he enjoyed playing the bad guy for a change and had a good time showing the cast what good acting actually is."
1,dvd,Not near as funny as I remembered it from the first time around years ago. I was a little disappointed.
1,Item not as shown.,The item's photo is for the new Estes parachute designed to look like chutes from the 60's. It looked nothing like the photo description. The design was different and it was purple and green. I returned it for a refund.
3,Does its job.,"This parachute does its job as it should. I don't know about other people, but I got the parachute that looks just like the description. My only complaint is that the thin material that the chute is made of is likely to burn if you don't use enough wadding. Now I don't mean burst into flames or anything but mine does have a couple little burn holes from chute deployment. Overall, this parachute is a necessity for larger rockets and other models, but be careful when packing the wadding and the chute."
2,The author is a genocidal murderer,I was drafted and sent to Vietnam in 1968. I have always wondered how a man could be so evil. Unfortunately the world court does not pursue U S war criminals. The man should be in prison and not making huge royalties from his lieing novels for God's sake.
2,Deeply disappointing,"As an historian who has studied and taught the Vietnam War, I was deeply disappointed in this book. Robert McNamara is a very intelligent man, which makes it worse. Why the disappointment? As Secretary of State, McNamara had access to excellent information, yet he writes as if he has only recently discovered information that was readily available during the war. I was hoping there was more to the story than willful ignorance."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","For me reading this book was a real disappointment. To me, it sounds very naive, coming from a person who was in one of the highest positions in the US government. It sounds like the truth is absent from its pages. Lets write another one but more realistic. This one is a mix of history, biography, novel and science fiction."
1,Further evasion,"""Unbelievable,"" one reviewer wrote. That is correct. This book is yet one more attempt to evade the issue, which is, as with all wars, ""WHY?"" Why the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War at all, never mind issues of mismanagement and what-not? WHY was it thought to be important to prevent ""Communist take-over"" in Vietnam, or elsewhere in S.E. Asia for that matter, when at the same time Communist rule in, say, Yugoslavia was not seen as any sort of threat and provoked no such response? McNamara knows; he says not a word about it. There is as far as I know only one book ""out there"" that deals with the real issue -- ""Why?"" -- and that is The Tragedy of Vietnam, by Patrick J. Hearden, soon to retire as a professor of history at Purdue University. It is available as a textbook only, which your bookseller needs to know if you wish to order it."
4,The banality of the arrogance of evil,"A thoughtful, if repellent, reflection. Unfortunately, much too little, way too late. It's a conclusive demonstration of the chains of events the unbridled arrogance of one powerful man can initiate. Arendt wrote about the ultimate banality of evil. McNamara represents the banality of arrogance become evil. I am a combat veteran of this dismal adventure, and have tried for more than thirty years to come to terms with the vicious exploitation of our youth that undergirded and perpetuated it. There's darned little meaning to be found, and McNamara hasn't helped. Trust me: he earned and richly deserves every nightmare."
2,McNamara is still deluding himself,"AS an amateur historian on Vietnam, I grabbed this book right away. I thought a man as smart as McNamara would finally spill the beans after all these years. However sincere his aplogies in the beginning and ends of the book, the entire read seems as if it is nothing but a complicated rationalization for the tragedy. It offers no new insights in to the decisions or the main players in the tragedy, and even the lessons i nthe end of the book seem painfully obvious (Though not always followed) to any student of foreign policy. Though McNamara undoubtedly adds some interesting footnotes to history, this book adds little to the existing literature. Halberstam's THe Best and the Brightest, Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie, Karnow's Vietnam, and Frances Fitzgerald's Fire In the Lake look better than ever. Read one of those instead, leave this book on the shelf where it belongs. It may have been therapeutic for its author, but it offers us little."
3,Missed Opportunities,"McNamara never got to the point his role in the Vietnam disaster. Instead we get to feel that his introduction of stastical control in Pentagon was a triumpth. McNamara to his credit did acknowledge some of his errors in questioning the decisions made, but he was not critical enough on himself not to have put his foot down firmer afterall he did openly agreed in more than once that there was no military solutions to Vietnam. If that was agreed why did he continued to pursue the military strategy? However McNamara continued to push the blame to the hardliners (conservatives faction) within the LBJ administration and the Bumbling generals in Saigon.However the book did paint a picture how our leaders made decisions, major decisions that have great impacts on our lives without due debate and clear analysis. Its really scary if that is how supposely clever people make decsions!"
3,Disappointing,"As an avid history book reader, ""In Retrospective: the tragedy ..."" was a real deception. This book was written with the sole purpose of deceiving the american public opinion. It is well known that Ho Chi Minh had early contacts with the american intelligence agencies during WWII and probably the Viet Cong was a creation of America as an instrument to decolonize French Indochina. How Mr. McNamara dare to say that the entire campaign was a big misunderstanding that drove America to a long war of attrition. It is too late to asume responsabilities but don't asume it in such a way."
1,Not Recommended,"Most people expect an artist's video to contain the artist. This video has still images while many people talk about the band itself along with theories and formulas about the band's hybrid music style. This product does not contain any of Linkin Park's songs, moving pictures or band members. If you enjoy listening to interviews of a couple of fans and a few industry people talk about Linkin Park, then perhaps you need brain surgery... err you may like this video. It's a complete waste of time and money for fans of the band."
1,People...PLEASE! Open your eyes.,"It's an UNAUTHORIZED DVD...this means the band has NOTHING to do with it. Hence, no interviews with them or live performances. These things generally ARE pretty bad. The only thing the ""producers"" are ALLOWED to use are pictures.If you are expecting to see interviews & performances, stick to something Linkin Park endorses."
1,Complete Waste of Money.,"20 Bucks down the drain on this one. I LOVE Linkin Park and bought this because I had never heard of it before. But I was horribly wrong. The Interviews are Horrible, the Camera Work and sound is horrible. The music in it is stupid royalty free loops. This DVD is the worst, most unprofessional DVD i've ever seen. Save some time and money, and go out and buy ""Frat Party At the Pancake Festival"" the REAL Linkin Park Documentary. You'll be pleased."
1,"Worst ""video"" (if you can call it that) ever","Please don't get this, get the Pancake Festival instead, it has so much more. This video is unauthorized, so there is no commentary or anything truely from LP. In conclusion please don't for your own sake."
3,"Yes, I gave it three stars","Of course I gave it three stars. One for being about Linkin Park. Two for the cheap rip-off music. Three for it's Incredible hilariousness! I could laugh all day at this DVD.how does the line go...""It's mainly the kind of music that, after i found out they were from LA that makes it even better...because they're an LA band""""Some people say Linkin Park is a manufactured boy band. Screw you man!""See ya later, btw I'm Pete AKA CursedCarolers on LPU"
4,Sugar and Spice,Very good book. Could not stop reading until book was done. All of Fern Michaels book are very good.
3,christmas in a book,Ordered this book for the short story by Joanne Fluke and was happily surprised that the others were good to. The second story was a little trashy but overall a good book.
3,Just not very memorable,"4 unrelated stories that were an easy read but really not very memorable. Usually when I read a collection like this, I seek out other books an author has written - I don't see any need to do that here. As I type this, I can barely remember any of the stories - so really not very memorable.."
1,Couldn't finish it...,"I originally bought this book last year, and then after reading the first story and being sorely dissapointed, put it away. I found it again recently and decided to try the last story in the bunch, by Shirley Jump. This story started out ok, but then the middle and ending was just so badly written and contrived that I didn't even bother reading the last pages. I understand that romanace novels have a happy ending, but this was so corny that I felt like I was reading something a 12 year old wrote. Not to mention that I never truly felt the connection between Jake and Natalie anyhow. I think the middle two stories will now go unread forever."
4,Sugar and Spice,Great short stories centered around Christmas and romance. Most have marriages happening within two weeks after first meeting. Not likely in real life.
4,excellent!,i found this book to be very well written and it is by one of the best writer ( I think) in the Sillouhte desire series. It is about a man who has too much on his plate to worry about relationships and a woman who has nothing but time to give to helping people. They become neighbors and what do you know the kids actuall like this woman. There are many funny moments as they try to make a family. i found this book to be a great beach read.
3,Zadig:,"Voltaire chooses an oriental tale as setting for an analysis of human traits and the influence of good and evil on human destiny. The essentialy good Zadig suffers setback after setback on his quest to reunite with his true love and after having almost lost all hope of finding happiness he suceeds in overcoming the evil and jealous medlings of the people around him and is able to lead a content and prosperous life. In essence the story shows how human destiny is undisputable and that the road to a fullfilled life is long and hard. ""Zadig"" is a nice example of 18th century French Enlightment, questioning old traditions and social structures in combination with showing new views on humanity and ideals."
5,An insight into the mind of a political genius,"This book is important for all those that wish to understand how FDR thought. The book especially reveals the battle between Roosevelt and Churchill that went on behind the curtains during WW2. The fact that FDR also had plans to rid the world of colonialism after the war, is also shown clearly here, in this book written by the son of Roosevelt.You simply must read this book!/Torbjörn Jerlerup"
1,A JOKE.,"I bought this book because I needed information about ectoplasmic manifestations for a novel I am writing. I am not a Christian so automatically I am going to be dismissed because of my unbelief. However, I must say this gentleman makes some of the most ridiculous claims I have ever read. No doubt those who dwell on cutting edge fanaticism will devour his drivel right along with the 'LEFT BEHIND' novels. Oh how I wish people would read 'DEMON HAUNTED WORLD' by CARL SAGAN and learn how to use their bologna detectors developed over centuries of evolution. If they did read Carl Sagan's book they would be able to see right through this nonsense. But then again, most Christians probably think Sagan propogated ""doctines of demons."" Oh well."
1,Don't read it.....it's nonsense crap about a religion freak,"I bought the book and really regret buying it. I believe in the spirit world and in God, but this really is unbelievable story. It's like the writer seems to be a naive fourteen years old. The part that made me really feel that is when he really believed that their was a hairy demon touching him in a so-called seance, which, by the way, was probably a fraud that happens so often in the days. I really felt he was too much on religion, with Satan and demons everywhere and really want it to make Christianism the way to save from all that.... I really don't recommend it and I want my money back.....!!!!"
1,I can imagine --,"This is about the ""Reel Film Classics"" issue.how terrible must be the print with such over-sellers nonsense as this:""It is widely considered to be one of the top 100 greatest classic films of all time.""Actually it isn't -- which is a why we aren't given any sources for that ludicrous claim, that bald-faced fiction.It is only ""classic"" in the sense of competing for ""Worst Film of All Time"" -- as other reviews of it make abundantly clear. Taken as intended, as serious, it is totally unwatchable. Taken as unintended -- as a comedy/parody of bottom-of-the-barrel film-making -- it is endurable only the first time one watches is it, and briefly, thereafter, only as reminder of why one has it but doesn't watch it.One star -- half for the film, which deserves ""0""; half for the entertaining fantasy about the film which is intended to induce the unwary into buying the DVD at a hugely inflated price, though it too deserves ""0""."
3,Killers from Space DVD,"The DVD of ""Killers from Space"" (1954) that I ordered from amazon.com came from Quality Information Publishers (QIP) of Asheville, NC and was delivered promptly. However, the DVD itself appears to be a copy, perhaps this movie is in the public domain, although the DVD is stamped (c) 2006 by QIP. The video is not the best due to the age of the film, lots of scratches, etc. But, the video is watchable and audio is acceptable. My issue is with the DVD case. I was expecting the original artwork as displayed on amazon.com. However, the case I received is a generic case with no artwork at all. Half of the fun is looking at the goofy 50's artwork. I will not return the DVD, because it's not worth the effort. But, if I have the opportunity to purchase the DVD with the original artwork in the future I probably will. Rating 3 starts out of 5."
3,Good morning Mr. Phelps.,"I am guessing that Peter Graves was wishing that all of the copies of this movie had gone up in smoke. However, I am pleased that it didn't. It is a fun movie to watch and of course the subject matter....nuclear proliferation.....was alive and well in the 50's."
4,Helpful background ...,"In my experience, Nexium is a solid PPI but very, VERY expensive. I would only use it AFTER first trying others like Prilosec OTC and various generics. No reason to go straight to such a pricey drug unless it proves to work for your specific characteristics."
4,Nice tools,"High quality at a price I can afford. Good finish, Easy to get on the nut or head. Case is convenient. Like the ease of use of the box-end."
3,Needs stronger glue,"I bought this as a replacement charm thinking the smaller stones would be harder to lose. I was wrong. I am very careful to keep the bracelet out of water, and only wear it to work and on the weekend. I've managed to lose four of the six red gems, essentially ruining the charm."
5,"An emotional roller coaster ride, loved it.","Anne Eames, please don't let this be the end of the ""Montana Malones"". This last book in the trilogy was absolutely wonderful. I laughed, and cried, and actually stood up and cheered in parts. You made Josh and Taylor so real, I was absolutely mesmerized by their saga. Truly a work of art."
4,Going for the Max ! :,"Max J Cleland these two books, Strong at Broken Places and Going for the Max. Is a personal tribute to all American soldiers.Share it with all Veterans."
3,Click N Design 3d,"You can really make great labels with this software! You can nearly hide pictures on the label, so it looks like it's bleeding through.The 3d text can be twisted & manipulated many different ways. But there really isn't any tech support for it, when it doesn't work. Which is quite sad.The full face labels are nice to have, & doesn't get in the way of play. Keep in mind that car cd players are different. Yours may not want a label of any kind!"
4,"This is full of interesting details, also historical errors","I read with fascination the details on Napoleon's last exile. But the historical erros threw me off. He arrived on St. Helena in 1815, not 1814. His birthday was August 15th, not August 17th. His second wife's name was Marie Louise, not Marie Teresa. With all these easily confirmed facts in error, I wonder what else is inaccurate."
2,Beautifully written but pointless,"Julia Blackburn's meditation on St. Helena is beautifully written but nearly as dull as Napoleon's years in exile. The early chapters about Fernando Lopez were quite the best thing in the book -- after that, I wondered why the author had wasted her prodigious talents on material this boring. I also found her ""personal"" insights grating! It was truly a struggle to finish this one."
5,Stunning,"I own this lamp -- absolutely adore it and bought it after seeing the Tiffany Exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum a couple of years ago. What initially surprised me is how big it is -- I was expecting a smaller lamp -- but the leaves are so absolutely gorgeous, each one is a sort of tye dye and together they're just so beautiful, and that's when the lamp is off. When you turn it on -- ohmygoodness -- it's a whole other lamp completely. I was kind of surprised to read that it had been discontinued, so if you are fortunate enough to find one and love this style of lamp, don't hesitate. The detail work on the base is fantastic. I agree with what the other reviewer said, Quoizel does a wonderful job packing their products, so don't worry about having it shipped."
5,Great table lamp!,"Beautiful lamp, Great quality, Recommend without hesitationI had seen this lamp in brochures and wanted to order. In my procrastination over the last couple months, this item has been discontinued by the manufacturer-Quoizel. I searched and searched the lighting stores on the internet and locally and it was sold out everywhere but Amazon.com showed they had one available. I snapped it up and it was delivered and in my hot little hands in 2 days. It is beautiful, and I would recommend this item to anyone but........you can't get it because it is discontinued by the manufacturer.HOWEVER, We have several lamps and fixtures by Quoizel- they have many more styles available and the quality is impecable. Items are very well packed with plenty of custom cut styrofoam---I think the only way to get a damaged item is if it was run over by the truck!"
1,"Liberal revisionism at its ""best""","Ms. Debo, while doing a wonderful job in compiling documents, paints a philosophical interpretation of Indians and their great ""way of life"" that is entirely unwarranted by the facts, which she compiles nothing on. While there is justification in condemning governments and individuals who flagrantly broke the law and violated the individual rights of Indians (a concept they didn't come up with during their 50,000 unmolested years on the continent) her admiration for a mystical primitive group of cultures is rather disturbing in the modern age."
4,Perfect,"This book was perfect for my friend's five year old. She loved it, and continues to read it almost on a daily basis."
1,Horrible Quality,"The book was cheap, I will give it to you. However, the book was missing 20 pages in total. I don't want to bother with sending it back because it is too much hassle. Guess my son will never find out what happens with the littles and their cat!"
4,I'm really sick of reading this book,"Which is probably a good thing! My 4 year old loves these stories of a tiny family who lives in the walls of a suburban house. I find the plots somewhat wandering and the writing and vocabulary uninspired, but my daughter enjoys them, so I'm giving The Littles 4 stars in her honor."
3,In the Craftsman Style: Building Furniture Inspired by the Arts & Crafts Tradition (In The Style),"In the Craftsman Style: Building Furniture Inspired by the Arts & Crafts Tradition (In The Style)I Purchased this as a gift for a friend who builds Craftsman Style furniture. We were both a little disapointed that so many of the pieces were ""modernized"" and ""stlyized"" - almost to the point that they didn't seem to fit the genre."
2,Nicer online than in person,We received the lamp a few days ago and were not impressed with the quality of the glasswork. It look cheap and haphazardly done. We expected a lot more considering the near $200 price tag.
1,Bad lamp,"I bought this lamp in Dec. '09 as a xmas gift. The tiffany glass shade fell off as it stood on the desk untouched. The company, Lighting Universe, replaced the lamp. Within one week the same thing happened. Now the company didn't want to talk to me. The only thing I could do is return the lamp, at a cost of a 50.00 dollar restocking fee and 15.00 dollar shipping fee. This is the worst, by far, on line transaction I've encountered. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY TF7110Z"
1,don't buy it!,"I agree with Lorena from Milan. I am Italian as well and if you want your kid to learn Italian in the right way, especially pronunciation, stay away from this book. The leading singer has a very strong accent that makes it hard for me at times to understand what she is singing (and I am a NATIVE Italian and I teach Italian in the US so I am used to bad accents...)Also, the songs are translated in a way that does not match the music, so when I listen to it, it gives me the chills. You can find much more authentic material around done and sang by real Italians!!"
5,Great cd!,"This is a great CD. I use it for an italian playgroup that I run, and moms and kids enjoy the familiar tunes!"
5,Singing in the car...,A wonderful product to help my daughter grow up bi-lingual.We have been lisnening to it since she was 3 months old on our car trips around town and even I have come to expect and enjoy the friendly and memorable songs.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. IT HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS, IT DID NOT TELL YOU HOW TO PRONOUNCE THE WORDS. IT WAS JUST SONGS IN ITALIAN. IT DID NOT ""TEACH""."
3,Sizing issues,"I received my ""plus size"" tights a few days ago. I wear tights every day. I love tights. I am only just on the border of being a plus size tights wearer because my legs and waist are not plus sized just my booty. I hate pulling tights up from my butt crack every time I bend over. Mostly I just like my tights to me a little bit looser and more comfortable. These tights are about a 5-6 on a scale from 1-10 on quality. For the price the quality is as expected. But they are not plus size. Boo. Giving them away to a tiny friend."
1,"If looking for opaque, LOOK ELSEWERE!","I bought these for a costume and wanted white opaque tights. Unfortunately, they were not opaque and my legs looked pink/white. But since the package was opened, I was not allowed to return them. Do not buy things from ilovesexy, difficult to return and products are not what they advertise."
5,Pretty strudy,"Bought this for my girlfriend, I have no clue about tights, so can't really comment here, but they seem to fit well for her, at least she's happy."
5,Comfortable,"Got these in purple, they fit like a dream and are really comfortable, don't ride down, sturdy and opaque, want to buy more colors!"
4,Christmas Present,"I actually didn't buy this for myself, I bought it for a friend. When I received it, I opened it and it came in the same package just like other tights. The one with the little hook and then the information (or whatever it is) paper wrapped around it. I didn't take it off of the hook because I wanted it to be ""new"" when my friend received it so I haven't tried it on or anything. But when I touched it, it seems like a good, non-cheap quality, I'm sure she'll love it.EDIT: My friend loved it. When she first opened the packaging she said that the tights were extremely small (Forever21 tights are like that too) but then when she tried them out, it stretched out perfectly. She's about 5'6"" and these fit her fine. :)"
4,Sanus VMPL50S,"Well made and sturdy! Came with a large assortment of mounting hardware that will work with almost every Flat Screen.....execpt my Sony Bravia. I could have used the hardware that came with the kit, but it would have defeated the small profile that the bracket sits off the wall. The enclosed hadware would have required using spacers that would have put the TV farther away from the wall than I would have liked."
4,easy mount,"overall great product. very easy to mount. I expected it to have easier flexibility to slide it side to side..but it doesn't. we didn't center it perfectly and found out it wasn't a simple slide over..but not to hard to fix. Also the brackets should be labeled right and left for proper mount or else you don't have access to the tilt function, which we found out about afterwards..again an easy fix."
5,wonderful take on classic tales!,"This book was rather hard to track down. I had read it when I was younger, LOVED IT, lost it, and then spent a long time searching for it. I am very happy that I have found it. I give this book 5 starts because it truly is amazing! 10 or so years after reading this book, I still remember it and actively searched to find it, it is that good!Truly Grim Tales is a less classical ""Happily ever after"" fairy tale, but is more realistic(from a fantasy perspective) and true to the original darkness of the Grimm Fairy tales. I would suggest this book to all those who like to think outside of the box and be amazed at how different something common from our childhoods can be and still hold our interest and show us something new about the original tales that we might not have thought of before."
1,misrepresented,"This cushion measured less than an inch thick upon arrival, not the two inches promised in the specifications. After a month of use it measured about a half inch. We threw it out. Total waste of money!"
1,How much resveratrol is actually in this product?,"The figure of 200mg this product claims is extremely deceptive. It tells me nothing about the amount of total resveratrol in the product nor does it tell you how much of this is Trans-resveratrol, the isomer responsible for the health effects of resveratrol in all of the in vitro and human trials. Conversely there is no information on the amount of the cis-resveratrol isomer, which nullifies the effect of Trans-resveratrol. Resveratrol is not an easy supplement to manufacture properly. It is subject to oxidation and degradation by UV exposure. Only one company here protects their supplement from these effects by active packaging. It is not this one. What good is a supplement if it does not arrive in potent active form. When something appears to be too good to be true there is almost always a good explanation. In this case the explanation is being hidden from us."
3,What percent of the 200 mg. is resveratrol?,"Several of the resveratrol product offers here on Amazon are not at all clear about what the xxx milligrams really is.Is it 200 mg of something of which only a paart is actually resveratrol, or is all of the 200 mg. actually resveratrol?? Not showing the BACK of the label, where the ingredients are listed is NOT very reassuring."
2,Tastes like medicine.,"This has a medicinal whiff that can't be hidden even when blended in a smoothie with bananas and peanut butter. I think it's the Xylitol sweetener that's used in cough syrups and baby liquid aspirin, but whatever it is, it overpowers the taste of everything else.Kinda wish they'd make an unsweetened and unflavored version and just let us flavor our supplements and medicines as we see fit. I won't be buying another bottle."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS MISLEADING,I am very disappointed! Its says it has 200mg but the actual Resveratrol in each cap is only 10mg. Don't waste your money!
1,Not worth the money,I received this product and found it contained 10mg of actual resveratrol...I returned it and went elsewhere. I a very disappointed in NOW for putting out such a low quality product.
1,SUCKERS,oh yeah anti aging product for $13.99. if anything this POS increases the size of your sphincters because you're really getting screwed out of 13.99 + shipping.
5,about the book,Sampler Supreme is a showcase of quilts. Its a book for quiltmakers who relish the challenge of intricate patterns requiring precise piecing and ingenious use of fabric to reach the full perfection stage. As few as four or five blocks set together and enhanced with borders can be beautiful.
3,"Great knife, but hard to close.","This knife is nice and it very easy and fast to open, although very hard to close. The piece that comes over to hold the blade in place gets caught on the blade and is very hard to move back over. Although this knife has no other problems I still only give it three stars out of five."
1,A bunch of lie... and it's still 4 star item?,"Those people who've read this book and felt heartwarming, or whatever, I'm very, very sorry for you.This book is just bunch of lies, and it just doesn't even deserve its place in any bookshelves."
5,"Courageous, Honorable, Amazing","I have eagerly awaited the release of My Friend Leonard. James Frey's works are unprecedented. James touches every part of the soul with his writing. My Friend Leonard touched me so deeply I feel like James and I have been close friends ever since he stepped foot on that airplane and headed for rehab. James has lived some of the darkest moments that no one will ever live themselves in their lifetime or read about in any other biography. James Frey has amazing courage, strength and integrity."
1,Bad Book,"I found this book very boring and written in a poor attempt to be cool by omitting punctuation and repeating words and phrases. Given we now know the author has essentially lied about his past, one would think he could have devised a better story. The plot is a bore and the characters are cartoonish. The author spends half the book feeling sorry for himself and the other half crying, crying."
1,Don't give James Fray your money.,He has lied about everything in his books. The only reason he claimed that this was non-fiction was nobody thought that it was good enough to publish as fiction... and it's not.If I could give it 0 stars I would.
1,"Too bad- I was all excited to read, but now...",The flack surrounding this author has spoiled my interest. Wanna but an used- but still new!- copy?
1,Duped,"I completely agree with the previous review and thus have not had the least interest in reading this fabrication. If I thought the bookstore would take it back, I'd return it. As it is, I consider it a lesson learned at a relatively cheap price."
2,So-So,"I read this on the heels of A Million Little Pieces, which I loved. If you read it without reading a Million Little Pieces I think it falls flat. It's an okay book, but not one that I find even slightly credible. Even if everything Leonard said and did is for real, or if everything is fiction, it's still not much of a story and not terribly interesting."
5,My Friend Leonard,"This is a touching story af a man who was able to improve his very sad exhistance, with the help of a good friend named Leonard.Through the author's use of the protagonist as the narrator, we get an inside view of the personal torment our main character experiences in his quest to stay sober, to find love and meaning.We suffer his suffering, we cry when he cries, we feel what he's feeling and we hope that he stays sober and finds the love he's looking for, despite the many setbacks and dsiappointments and opportunities to just ""give up"" when there's nothing left to live for, he continues remarkably, his struggle for self awareness and self-actualization.This is a story about perserverance, struggle, personal demons, relationships, and how we come to terms with the unbearable reality that we are alone and we alone control our destiny."
3,Replay of other work,My Friend Leonard is a quick read with little suprise if you have read any other works from James Frey. I don't read his work for suspense and would not expect it from him.I like the great examples he demonstrates on the importance of friendship when you are an addict.
1,Don't give this man & his publishing co another dime!!!,"I previously gave Frey a glowing review for A Million Little Pieces(which Amazon will not allow me to amend), but that was before thesmokinggun.com exposed him for what he is: a liar. This cannot be a story of recovery if he is not honest. Shame on Oprah and her producers and the publishers of this book for not at least trying to verify some of the more outlandish parts of his story (a root canal with no medication???)."
1,Lies too,"If you think it is morally okay to lie, cheat and steal, then you still shouldn't read this book. Instead, you should reevaluate your own moral compass, especially if you're an addict in support of lying. It starts with honesty and memoirs make a contract with the reader that the events are true. Want to by some beach front property you can feel good about?"
1,Please Help Frey Pay His Beach House Mortgage,"James Frey has admitted that he never did 3 months in jail as claimed in his smash bestselling ""memior"" ""A Million Little Pieces"" - check out thesmokinggun.com....The guy never did time, and apparently was more of a drunk driver than the hardened criminal he portrays. If you want to make him richer, get this book."
1,PT Barnum is smiling,"This clearly is fiction because I met Mr. Frey in prison (I mean waiting room at County Jail)...I never hit Mr Frey over the head with a metal tray...I mearely asked him if I could borrow an ""ashtray""With Frey's works of fiction selling over 2+ million copies...clearly PT Barnum is smiling...we were all suckers..."
2,Second million load of lies,"I wanted to read this book to tie up loose ends and find out what happened to the characters (Lily, did James drink again etc)...in light of everything that has come out, I can't for a second think that shy James Frey was a ""runner"" for the mob...or even that Leonard existed. Now that James has admitted that his is not the tough guy portrayed in MLP, I can't buy the life that he leads in MFL.It's unlikely that someone so newly clean and sober could endure all the things that happen in this book and not drink.I'm sorry that I spent money buying both of these books in hardcover. I will NOT be tempted to read another of his books (if there is one).ps: I've over Oprah, too!"
1,"Book opens with continuation of lies from ""Pieces!""","After learning of James Frey's totally bogus jail time, how can you possibly believe anything in this book!?!? He starts this book off with a bold face LIE! If it was sold as fiction I'd say it was a reasonable piece of writing. However, to say it's autobiographical, and then proceed to start the story with a totally fictional kick-off, what part, if any part of this story, really happened? The publisher should be taken to task for releasing a second bogus book by Frey listed as nonfiction! No one talked much about this second book - it's just as guilty of false storytelling as the first one, ""A Million Little Pieces!"" The lies of James Frey, Part 2!!!"
2,My Friend Leonard,"I was very excited to see an immediate follow up to ""A Million Little Pieces"", and I must say I enjoyed that book very much. Mr Frey really knows how to take you on a journey through his life, and keeps you spellbound as you read each additional little piece of it. I do wish, however, he would refrain from using the F word every other word. I submit that this book would have been half as thick if the F word were omitted. I know he does not lack a vocabulary, so the excuse must be from habit. I do not enjoy seeing this in print and feel most women don't. I would love to read more of his books if he could only lose this word. With utmost respect for his talent, let me just say ""please clean up the next phase of your life story.Sincerely,Barbara Collier"
1,Moronic,"This is the worst book I think I have ever attempted to read. Frey's writing style is monotonous, boring and repetitive. The plot is nonexistant and unbelievable. The lack of punctuation and repetitive words make it even worse.I would laugh laugh if I weren't crying crying over how bored I was while reading it."
1,I tried to see past the crash-and-burn of Million Little Refunds,"...but this book was tossed after 50 pages. The book didn't hold my attention, the punctuation and repetition was tedious and excessive. Hopefully future writings by Frey don't follow the same tedium."
5,I loved it!,"I am not sure how to explain how much I loved this book. If you read A Million Little Pieces, this book is a must. I think everyone needs to have a Leonard in their lives."
5,I wish Leonard was my friend,"Give it a chance; it's a great story, true or not! Once you get a few chapters deep you will not be able to put it down. It's a very quick read and has a completely different vibe from `A Million Little Pieces' in that it is much more optimistic from the start.....until you get to the end that is!!!!!Take James for what he is, a gifted writer. Read it and show Oprah who is boss!!!!"
5,Better than watching Oprah!,"A truly moving story of an unlikely friendship, this is the sequel to ""A Million Little Pieces"". It is written in the same no-frills,urgent style. Do not be sidetracked by the controversy: this is one of the better books of 2005."
2,James Frey - Disappointment,When i thought there was some semblance of truth to his story it was more compelling - i bought this book after reading A Million Little Pcs. I guess it's a decent book if you recognize it as fiction - personally I would not have read it knowing that's what it was
1,My friend Stupidity,"Utterly outrageous. A treacly, horrible work containing no more literary substance than a pork rind does nutritional value."
1,My Friend Leonard is no friend of mine,horrible piece of writing.....real garbage riding on the coat tails of the success of A Million Little Pieces. A real yawn
5,Great book!,I would strongly recommend this book. It's great continuation of A Million Little Pieces.
1,My Friend Fiction,"The only porterhouse that ever confronted Mr. Frey was the frozen one that slid out and hit him in the head when he opened his mommy and daddy's freezer in a drunken stupor looking for a snack to appease his ""beer munchies"".He was then compelled to document his relationship with ""porterhouse"", ensuring, of course, an accurate and honest portrayal, hence the first part of this book. As to the existence of Leonard, I'm reminded of Tom Hanks and his volleyball ""Wilson""...I would like a refund."
3,good book,"I was half way through this book when the whole thing came out with the smoking gun's report on the events that occurred in A Million Little Pieces. I loved that book and when i found out the reports were true I felt very disappointed and duped. He's a good writer and I enjoyed reading My Friend Leonard, but I of reminded myself that it was most likely a work of fiction."
4,A toast to friends from rehab,"It's rare that a personal memoir qualifies as a page-turner, but James Frey's ""My Friend Leonard"" does, at times.Frey manages to bring his characters, including himself, to life on these pages and the reader can't help but sympathize with the plights big and small thrown their way.The book begins after Frey leaves rehab -- where he met Leonard -- for alcohol and drug addiction. The author's struggles his addictions throughout the book ably portray the power of the disease.I highly recommend this book, particuarly for anybody out there who's been through rehab and knows about all the crazy characters you meet in there."
2,disappointed,"after reading amlp i had to have this book. not long after reading it, the whole oprah thing happened and i realized this book and amlp was a lie. i questioned these books while reading them. i thought how could all of this stuff really happen to one man??. but i believed it anyway and was extremely disappointed to find out that although james frey is a great storyteller...that's all..a storyteller. he should've been up front to begin with. the books are amazing but not so much when you are led to believe that they are true then find out it's all a fabricated lie."
3,NOT AS MOVING AS A MILLION LITTLE PIECES,THE STORY CONTINUES WHERE A MILLION LITTLE PIECES LEFT OFF. iT WAS A GOOD STORY BUT IT DID NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OR EMOTION THAT JAMES FREY'S OTHER BOOK HAD. ALTHOUGH FROM RECENT NEWS i DO NOT FEEL CHEATED OTHER THAN THE BOOKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LABELED AS NOVELS.
3,It's entertaining.,This lacked the intensity of A Million Little Pieces. It felt predictable. It seemed a bit like an ongoing fantasy. It is an interesting and quick read. It is entertaining. Would be a good book for a trip. I approached it as pure fiction.
3,good but not that good..,"Over all I thought it was a good book, but the lies were too much. Everything about the book interested me, but tooo much cursing. If he every writes another book again, besides ""My Friend Leonard"" he need to tell the truth or don't write at all!"
1,Just Awful,"I read ""A Million Little Pieces"" and bought this book before I realized what a complete dork Frey was. This guy has a serious self image problem that he tries to correct in his books. All the tough rhetoric is a joke. None of this s*** ever happened. Whether you believe him or not, he is a pathetic writer. Save your money."
1,bland boring and embarrassing,I pick up the book. I read the book. I ask myself why why why why did I finish the book. I cry tears of joy when I am finished.
1,James Fry lives in a fantasy world,"this book is even more unbelievable than the first. I have to say that the only reason I bought this book was out of curiosity due to all of the controvery surrounding the first book. It was a big dissapointment, don't waste your time."
2,Not His Best Work,"I really enjoyed a Million Little Pieces. I read it before the controversy came out. I also enjoyed his latest book, A Bright and Shiny Morning.However, My Best Friend Leonard, was uninteresting and unbelievable. It is a sequel to A Million Little Pieces and really embellishes the story of his life after rehab. There is a note in the front of the book that some of the story was fiction. However, the entire read was FICTION. It made it difficult to read knowing that he didn't just publish this as a book of fiction. This guy has a great imagination.....and a distorted sense of truth.to believe that a ganster/mobster befriended him, took him in as his son, gave him thousands of dollars, etc.... is nonsense.Skip this one.... you'll be better off."
1,Time to leave the sinking ship,"By now everyone who receives any information at all other than Oprah's determination to ""stand by her man"", honest or not, should know that this author's veracity has been thoroughly and fundamentally discredited.If you want mediocre fiction maybe this book is acceptable. Its claims to truthfulness, however, rank right up there with the likes of the Enquirer.There are plenty of books on the subject of addiction that have legitimate claims of credibility. Readers are better off to spend their emotional engagement, compassion and money there than with this cynical and unconscionable con job."
1,"Ohhh, the irony!","If you look at the amazon.com page selling Frey's ""My Friend Leonard"", you'll find a little piece Amazon likes to call ""The Amazon Significant Seven"" where celebrity authors are asked the same seven questions. The third question is , ""What is the worst lie you've ever told?"" His answer!!? ""No way I can answer that."""
4,Fantastic sequel to A Million Little Pieces,"James Frey has provided another magnificent memoir, possibly even a little better than AMLP. His friendship and father/son relationship with the amazing Leonard is brought to such life in this story, and I lapped up every page. MFL also vividly describes Mr. Frey's progress since rehab, and seems to leave nothing to the imagination. By the time I was finished reading, I was even used to Mr. Frey's lack of punctuation, which was the only thing that really bothered me about AMLP. Congratulations to the author for such a profound work."
3,Just ok....,"I had heard of this book before Frey's crash and burn on Oprah. I decided to read it anyway. The first of the book made me feel crazy, like I was going through the drug withdraw...it was painful and made me want to pull my hair out. Not bad, just unique writing. The rest of the book was just ok. Nothing great, nothing terrible. I'm pretty sure the end is pure fiction, and I think I saw it in a movie once. If you have nothing else to read, go for it, but there are other books out there that are better."
3,Anticlimactic,"I felt this book was anticlimactic in comparison to Frey's first book, A Million little pieces. It really didn't deal with recovery from alchohol/drug addiction. It was a lot about nothing and took forever to cut to the chase. I loved the first book, despite all the controversy...this one I could have done without."
1,not a gripping tale,"this book did not pull me in like A MILLION LITTLE PIECES. i felt that it dragged and i just didn't care about the characters this time around. though i almost put it down, i found myself skimming through a great deal of it to get to the end and was pleased to discover that the end was infact, the best part."
2,My Friend Leonard,I couldn't get into it...either because of all the James Frey controversy or because it just isn't as gripping a tale as A Million Little Pieces. I haven't decided.
2,Not worth your money,"I bought this book because I enjoyed A Million Little Pieces so much - that is until I found out that the author had embellished much of that book. Given the author's track record and becuase many of the events are related in both books, I felt that most of the experiences were fabricated. It was fairly boring anyway without much going on and then to think most of the book probably wasn't true........I was extremely disappointed to find that Mr. Frey had portrayed this book as being true events that actually happened to him. I will not be reading any more of Mr. Frey's ""memoirs"".+"
4,Wonderful,"An amazing book. Despite all the fuss and controversy, James Frey is an extremely talented writer. I can't wait till his next book."
5,Brilliant,"I bought this book the other day in the airport (Monday to be exact) and have not been able to put it down since then (today is thursday). I have skipped studying for tests and instead have continued reading this book. It was absolutely captivating. His account for detail is amazing, with the gruesome descriptions of his dental work and his toenail. His journey through rehab was so motivating and inspiring. I can't wait to read ""My friend Leonard."" Hopefully James Frey continues his literary work and writes many more books."
2,My Friend Leonard,"Since we the people were bamboozled by the first book, A Million Little Pieces, I purchased this as a curiosity as the continuance. I should have waited for the paperback.James Frey should receive a reward for all the confusion he has created as to whether these should be non-fiction or fiction. He took many liberties with his memoirs and the reader may feel that since he's admitted that there were some exaggerations, then what is actually true????"
4,A touching story of friendship...,"I think James Frey has incredible talent. And although I felt that ""Bright Shiny Morning"" showed more maturity, ""My Friend Leonard"" was an excellent read.James draws you into his characters and you find yourself sympathizing, hoping and feeling and although his books are thoroughly engrossing some of his style choices are a bit tiresome, but who says you have to read every word.Would I recommend this book, yes, but be prepared to spend a lazy afternoon on a cozy couch finishing it."
4,even if it's not true.......,This book was a great novel! I really like James Frey style of writing. It is quick and tells the story in a way that makes it hard to put the book down.Anyone who has read A MILLION LITTLE PIECES must read this. Read it as a novel and you wont be disapointed.
2,Disappointing,"I was anxious to read this book after having been swept away by A Million Little Pieces and was very disappointed by My Friend Leonard. Much of the content was superfulous and didn't add to the storyline... There were too many characters to keep track of that weren't central to the plot. He should've focused more on convincing the reader why his relationship with Leonard was so significant. To sum it up, Frey falls very short of striking the emotional chords he struck in A Million Little Pieces. Wait and take it out of the library if you really want to read it or buy my copy. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
5,A Must Read Book!,"After reading ""A Million Little Pieces"" I was thrilled when this book came out. I read it in less than 3 days, could not put it down. James Frey is amazing and I must say would love to see these two books go to MOVIES! This book made me laugh& cry it is very touching. Even if you have never had an addiction it is so compelling to read. God Bless you James and keep up the great work!"
4,My Friend Leonard,"I read this book knowing the controversy following the ""fiction or nonfiction"" issue. Regardless of it's truthfulness, I enjoyed the story line. It was as well written as the first book, and the characters continue to be interesting and believable. I think I read the book in three sittings, so it really kept me hooked in. For me, that's what makes a good book."
3,not sure what to think,dont' get me wrong james frey isw a good writer but with the discovery that many parts of his first book are out and out lies i dont know what to make of this one
1,My friend the smoking gun,"James Frey is a phony-tough charlatan. His work published as non-fiction is deplorable. It seems as if even the most cursory fact-checking would have discredited him. The Smoking Gun has exposed him for the opportunistic, conman of the afflicted he is. False hope, hijacked truth and cowardish evasion.Artistic embellishment is far different from complete and utter fabrication. I wonder if Oprah is stll ""staying up at night"" over his tall tales of fratboy fantasy."
3,Answered questions lead to more,"After devouring A Million Little Pieces, I was left with questions...how did James get through his jail time? Did he reunite with Lily? Was he able to repair his relationship with his parents and brother?Like some of the other reviewers here,I still had most of the same questions and even a few more after finishing My Friend Leonard. How did James manage to move to LA and become successful within months when success has eluded others for years or forever? His family is barely mentioned and women move in and out of his life without much explanation from one page to the next. The quickie synopsis of AMLP given in bits and pieces at the beginning of My Friend makes the 1st book sound trite and superficial when in fact, it was riveting and better written than the 2nd. I'll be offering my hard bound copy to anyone who wants to read it so that none of my friends wastes $24.95."
1,fluff,I am bitterly disappointed with MFL after rushing out to buy it the night I finished AMLP. I found the writing and content to be juvenile and uninspired.
2,Leonard And Lilly Are Fake,"This is Frey's attempt to show you how he was able to emerge from the seedy underbelly of society and triumph. Lilly and Leonard are fake. Crackwhores and mobsters do not have hearts of gold, they will stab you in the back and rob you blind. Frey has a deluded imagination. He needs to get back down to earth and see things the way they really are."
1,Worst book I read this year,"It took me 6 weeks to get through this and that's saying something seeing how thinly structured this book is. If you didn't read the fraudulent predecessor, you'd be lost--or maybe not since it's written on a third grade reading level. Frey pulled a fast one on me a few years ago. I dismissed the writing style then because I thought we were dealing with someone with a fragile state of mind. Here, there seems to be a lack of consistency. What happened to his love of reading from the first book? It changes to drawings and paintings in this book. I'm supposed to believe a struggling screenwriter turns down massive amount of money left to him from a friend that loved him like a father-and what about the strife between him and his parents? It just melts away? I just hated this book. I read it because I bought it before the scandal broke and it was the next book in my TBR pile. Trust me when I say Frey won't be getting another dime from me."
3,"A Decent Book, Nothing More","My Friend Leonard is entertaining, yet certainly lacks the elements inherent in truly well-written literature. Frey's grammar-defying prose may seem refreshing to some, but will very likely just plain annoy others.The bottom line is that this is a straightforward tale of a young man and his unlikely father figure. My Friend Leonard is sure to keep the reader interested, though the inquiry ends with the turn of the last page, as Frey's story does little to make the reader think.Recommended for those looking for an easy, entertaining read; if you're seeking thought-provoking content, look elsewhere."
4,i wish i had a friend like leonard,"the million little pieces has brought me to read on this book, which i really hope there could be another one i can still read onthe story has closed emotions and bonds withinvery unforgettablei shed tears again"
3,Well-written,"Well-written. In light of the news that most of this book should accurately be called fiction, my opinion stands. Is Mr. Frey dishonest? Sure. But his use of fiction, though he at one point called it non-fiction, in my mind does not change the work itself. Perhaps i'm an old New Critic, but that's where I stand. Read the book because it's a good book; don't deem it bad just because Mr. Frey is a ""bad"" person."
1,This book is a scam and a fraud.,"This book, while not well written, was good because it was supposed to be real. Now that we find out Mr. Frey is a liar and thief, his poor writing is evident and the book has found its way to my recycle bin along with A Million little Pieces (also lies.) Shame on Mr. Frey and Oprah for perpetrating this fraud."
1,A Million Little Leonards,"It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as ""non-fiction"" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey."
5,love this book!,I read this book in two days. I read A Million Little Pieces and loved it and I was so excited when I saw My Friend Leonard was a sequel to the story. This was a very real and raw account of drug addiction and ultimate success in becoming sober and staying that way. I love this book.
2,Kept hoping for more,"I really had high expectations for this book. I found it predictable and boring. But I stuck it out and did not give up. Up until the very last page, I kept praying it would improve."
1,My Fabricated Friend Leonard,"It is sad to see so many people duped by James Frey, especially when many of those people are vulnerable. Mr. Frey is yet another con artist preying on the emotions of the public. How tragic to hear that people are using Mr. Frey's life experiences as a model for recovery. Tragic, that is, because we now know that those life experiences were simply fabricated by Mr. Frey.Lies are lies and should not be told. In ""My Friend Leonard,"" we have Mr. Frey telling more tall tales and lining his pockets in the process. Do not buy this book unless you are buying it out of curiosity for how a fraud can become a millionaire."
5,A solid book that I will forever keep!,"After reading a million little pieces, I craved more from Frey he wrote his story in such a true, open way that I felt like I knew him and all the people involved in his life. When My Friend Leonard came out, I rushed to the store to buy it...This book was AMAZING! Better then the first...Following James's life after rehab and jail, a life without the substance abuse and watching him build himself back up was truly amamzing...Everything about this book is straight from the heart! The relationship that James and Lenoard formed is unlike any I have ever heard or had - I went through a roller coaster of feelings from laughing to crying....I can't say enough about it...after reading it, I made it my mission to have everyone I know read both books and I have yet to hear dissapointment from anyone."
1,Please do not support dishonesty,"If you buy this book, you will be adding to the bloated wallet of one of the most despicable authors to have ravaged a vulnerable group of people. Shame on James. AND PORTERHOUSE in this book is not real either. READ thesmokinggun.com This Book has a voodoo hex attached to it and your head will shrivel up to the size of a tomato if you even think about buying it."
1,"More ""truth"" from the preppy fraud","James Frey sure learnt a lot about jail and met some pretty wild characters for someone who spent 5 hours in custody. And he now admits that.He's a liar. His thoughts are worthless, his prose is feeble, and once you strip away the only reason for reading that (that it's meant to be true) you are left with the stinking carcass of literary fraud. Refunds are available."
2,I loved it,"A Million Little Pieces was good, but My Friend Leonard was even better. What a colorful character Leonard was.It doesn't matter to me that Frey embellished the truth, both books are good and thoughtful reads.Suzanne"
5,Another fantastic effort!,"Well done, James Frey! I didn't think anything James wrote could live up to A Million Little Pieces. But My Friend Leonard did just that. I read most of the book on my way to and from work on the bus, and kept having to put the book down to wipe tears from my eyes (and to shield myself from other commuters seeing me crying!!)But you MUST read A Million Little Pieces before you read this. James answers all the questions in My Friend Leonard that were racing round my head after I read Pieces.I have never cried over complete strangers like I did when reading these two books.My favourite author by a long way....i can't praise him enough!!!"
4,Very useful handbook for those interested in landscapes,"I like to travel throughout Colorado and have found this book to be very useful in understanding the form and geologic history of the landscape I am travelling through. The book is well illustrated and detailed enough to be useful, at least for the person with a non-professional interest in geology. My major regret is that it is not available on CD or tape so that it could be more efficiently used with only one person in the car!"
1,NOT FOR MACBOOK PRO!,"Very misleading title - this plan is for PPC Powerbooks, NOT Macbook Pro!The model # for Macbook Pro Applecare is MA515LL/AAppleCare Protection Plan for MacBook Pro/Powerbook MA515LL/A 3 Years"
1,what a disappointment,"My 23"" apple display died two weeks ago. It is still here, waiting for apple to ""get it together"". I have never experienced such a complete lack of competence and pathetically slow action plan in my life. Nothing about this has been easy. Even the hold times on the phone are over 20 minutes. There is no email support either.The warranty makes certain promises. Unfortunately they do not live up to this average person's expectations.I am considering a call to the BBB for now and if things drag much further on, legal action."
1,Absolute Garbage,After foolishly letting myself be badgered for the 3rd time by Apple sales people into buying this plan I've finally learned my lesson. They warned and warned-you'll be sorry if something goes wrong. Well my MacbookPro has a hardrive problem-NOT COVERED IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM. The money(over $300) I would have saved by not buying this plan would have paid for the $300 repair.What's its cover-almost nothing of consequence. Message to Apple-tell your staff to stop trying this shove this worthless plan down customers throats. Want to give money away-there's a lot of worthwhile charities!
3,Savage Grace,"Although I really enjoy Cassie Edwards, this was not my favorite of hers. I did like this book, as I have all the books I have read by Cassie Edwards. I just had a problem with the story line. The idea of Shayless coming back to earth as an Angel, instantly falling in love and then being granted another chance on earth, was a bit much. Once I got past all that, I did enjoy the book. Cassie Edwards can tell a tale that keeps the pages turning. I do enjoy how the bad guys always seem to get it in the end."
4,Thunder Heart,Story caputres your attention right from the frist page and continues to keep the reader avidly enthused. Captivated with the sensativity and compassion of this writer. Intrigued with the romance.
3,Love live in Ancient Egypt,"I would say that the book has been mistitled as the emphasis is on love rather than sex with the central chapter being on love poems.In a sense this is quite important as it lays the myth that our concepts of romantic love come from the Troubadours of medieval France. Clearly they predate it, and haveOh my god, my Lotus flowerIt is lovely to go out and ..I love to go and bath before you ..I allow you to see my beauty in a dress of finest linen drench with fresh unguentI go down to the water to be with youand come up tp you again with a red fishlooking splendid on my fingersI place it before you ...Come! Look at me! these ideas predated the troubadours by centuriesI don't feel the book has sufficient information for the price it now attracts."
4,Visually splendid but slow-moving,"This movie is an absolute delight to watch if you're interested in cinematography, and with all the winter scenes it's best to watch it during an oppresive heat wave as I did. You could turn the sound off and get the idea, which is that an old man whose wife has died is trying to reconcile with his estranged elder son. The younger son has been taking care of him, and of course that causes a lot of problems. The pace is extremely show -- ""leisurely"" if you like -- and you may lose interest if the visuals aren't enough to keep you involved. I was stationed in northern Japan in the US Air Force many years ago and the winter scenes in the local village brought back a massive amount of memories, which kept my interest more than it might yours. It's definitely worth watching but be prepared for the pace. The transfer to DVD is excellent."
4,Great Starter,I don't have any complaints from this set. It was a great starter set. We had all of our cookware in storage so we needed a quick start up set and this has done great.We've had this set for over 3 years now and it is still in excellent conditions.
2,not very non-stick,"Specifically the fry/saute pans. I have the 8 and 10 inch ones in my set (owned for about 8 years) and though I have cleaned them repeatedly with Soft Scrub and a Dobie pad as recommended, they still do not provide non-stick cooking. I am all but ready to toss them out. The Calphalon Tri-ply copper is a completely different story. I love those!!!"
4,Good for surround and music,Have used the Athena WS-15 speakers as left and right surround sound speakers for three months. They produce clear undistorted sounds that enhance movie watching or music listening.
5,gosh...richard davies.,"man...it just makes me wonder how these guys got so strange. jagged, pristine, great!! the bassist for the plague lounge liked it, too. the plague lounge are great!!"
2,Good captions. Poor quality photos!,"I was thoroughly dissapointed by this book. The photos aren't too interesting or unique. The only good point of this book is that all the photos come with fairly descriptive captions. Most of the full page photos are so grainy, they could have been taken with a disposable camera. I don't blame the 2 dozen photographers who contributed to the book. Just seems the publisher decided to use a lower print quality in order to sell the book at a lower price. If you want a much better book with photos that will blow you away, check out Steve McCurry's South Southeast."
5,Brillant---!!!!!!!!,This country needs thinkers like Nader...all his books are great to read. Including this one!
2,The Phone keeps Hanging,"I initially liked this phone with the touch screen, it is pretty stylistic. However, there seems to be a software bug in it, as it kept hanging once in a while. Normally, it happens when I press a wrong menu option and try to go back too quickly but it seems to happen even without a cause at times and sometimes I do not realize it has hanged, while just lying in its cover and later my friends complain that they've been trying to call me without getting any response from me.I would not recommend this phone and would hope that Sony Ericsson, improve their Quality control a bit more and do comprehensive testing before launching such expensive products."
1,Save your cash!!!,"It's toilet paper. It is not tear resistant, flame resistant, made of gold, anything.Five.Dollar.Toilet.Paper."
2,Not Enough Wad,"no. I did not favor this product...it set my house on fire. There was not a sufficient amount of wadding in the package i purchased. i was only able to wad the nose of my ""rocket"" and I wasn't sure what to do with the box it came in. Instead of receiving the 302274 wadding I received the 302273 wadding. the chemical composition of the two was slightly different, and almost result in a misfiring of my ""rocket"". It blew my neighbor's cat up-into pieces."
3,"There are cheaper alternatives,....","the most common being the blown in cellulose material that home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot sell by the bale for less than ten bucks. It's really shredded newspaper that has been treated to be flameproof. Unless you fly daily, this is likely to be a lifetime supply. The Estes wadding does have its uses, such as wrapping the parachute or encircling a big wad of this stuff in a large diameter rocket so that the whole structure acts as a piston. Your best bet for getting Estes wadding is buying the bulk packs of motors, which you'll need anyway and which contain it."
4,Chinese Horoscopes Library: Horse,"Cute, interesting little book full of fun information. The book proivdes more depth than the usual Chinese restaruant place mats! I especially enjoyed finding there are different aspects of the Horse, based upon what year you were born. Not for a serious student of Chinese horoscopes, but definately a fun reference."
3,Not quite what i expected,I was expecting a different kind of book particularly with regards to the horse horoscope for 2013 . Its a little disappointing.
3,"Slow to arrive, quick to break","I ordered two Razr holsters which took several weeks to arrive and one of them broke within the first week I had it. The other is still in one piece, but it doesn't hold the phone very securely as it falls out easily if bumped. For the price (one penny) they're acceptable."
3,Convenient Clip,"Although it is obsolete now, this belt clip holder worked pretty good. The clip held the holster securely to my belt, and the holster clip itself worked okay.You must make sure the phone snaps into place, or it will fall out of the holster."
3,Very Cheap; Functional but has design flaws,I was looking for a slim holster for my Motorola V3 Razr phone. The two I bought before were quite bulky. This one is very slim. But it has two major design flaws: 1) you have to remove the phone from the holster to charge and 2) you have to remove the phone from the holster to use the camera.
3,looks great from a distance but like a cheap imitation up close,"From a distance this lamp looks great, but from up close it's a cheap looking plastic imitation of a Tiffany lamp. The soldering job on the ""metal"" between the pieces of plastic of the lamp shade is messy. I was disappointed but kept the lamp because it's in a spot where people rarely go closer than eight feet. From a distance it looks great!"
3,Outdated and doesn't include Index Server 1.1,"This book is concise and includes some good practice excercises. It also has a cd-rom with good quality multimedia presentations. However, I would not recommend this book for the current IIS 3.0 exam. Spend your money on the Sybex IIS Study guide instead. It more closely follows the exam objectives and covers Index Server."
2,"*** WARNING *** This is IIS Version 2.0, not current 3.0","You are guaranteed to miss the MCP test questions for version 3.0 and this is still the most current Microsoft Press Training guide!! Of course, enough of version 2.0 is still in the test that you probably will still pass this easiest of the MCSE electives."
4,Short Daily Devotionals,"If you looking for a good short daily devotional ... this is it. It only takes 5 minutes to read 2 or 3 of the devotionals and I've found that it gives my morning a ""jump start."" The devotionals are very upbeat and encouraging."
5,Great illustrations for encouragement and instruction,This devotional includes wonderful illustrations that encourage and teach in realistic ways applicable to our daily lives. I have read and re-read the book and am now using it as a gift idea for women from teens on up. A terrific resource.
4,A classic before the new wave of survivalism,"I've had my copy since the late 1980s and I recently re-read its yellowed pages again. I really enjoy the early story of Bill Moreland of why backpack survivalism isn't the answer. I also like the fact that his discussion of city survival isn't fatalistic, but realistic on the unique set of challenges posed by urban and rural survival.This book should not be your only book on the subject, but I do think it's worth having in your collection for a number of reasons. First, Benson looks at food security from a variety of sources that many authors who focus on a survival retreat ignore. Second, he has a realistic discussion on caching supplies that doesn't glamourize subsistence living, but prevents the ""all your eggs in one basket"" mentality that I despise in many books. While I question why he hasn't seen the light in solar, wind and hydro technologies, every author has their blindspots and if you want a single source on the subject, good luck."
2,same old same old,Interesting but really just the same old stuff. What to do when America inevitably goes to hell or when you have to hide out somewhere because the evil government is bullying you. You will survive if you read this book because no one else is going to figure out how to cook a dog?? Give me a break. I love reading the frightened pre-Y2K reviews. Hopefully these people are still living in a cave somewhere. This country has seen harder times than these. Ragnar (people refer to him by his first name?) should write a book about making a career and good money out of exploiting naive people's fears about their governments. I'd like to get in on that industry.
4,The Index of Jung's Collected Works,"This is the 20th and final volume of the Collected Works of Carl Jung (1875-1961), the ""General Index to the Collected Works"", assembled by editors and first published in 1979. Clearly, this is not a book one reads from cover to cover. Nevertheless, it is indispensable to anyone studying Jung in depth or compiling a ""Jungian"" interpretation of something. Jung was extraordinarily well read in philosophy, comparative religion & mythology, and alchemy, and his works are dense with those quotes. He frequently cites dreams to illustrate a point, and one can look up these exemplary dreams by topic in this index. This is a unique reference work."
4,Incredible B-sides,"What I love about this EP is the B-sides. Captain Easychord is feautured here in a ridiculous short version (the whole second part is missing) but the B-sides make up for it. 'Long Life Love' and 'Moodles' are quite similar, long songs which seem to be made up out of several ideas that are just stitched together. 'Moodles' is the better one, 'Long Life Love' has a breathtaking end, melody-wise. The best song here is 'Canned Candies', absolutely one of Stereolab's most moving songs ever released (and I'm a big fan) and indeed a brilliant slice of avant-pop, as someone here mentioned earlier."
4,Great Read- Especially for Folk Tales,"I've been infatuated (and terrified) of scary stories ever since I could read. So it's no wonder that as soon as I picked up my first copy of Short of Shivery at my Elementary School Library, I had a difficult time putting it down. Even now, some odd 10 or 15 years later, I still love picking up these books at reading them again and again.The stories are always fresh and colorful, (though some may be a bit tedious for younger kids) and the accompanying illustrations provide an excellent atmosphere to the book. Of course, it's 10 times more frightening when your 7 and suddenly the Murdering Rampage of some psychopath or ghost pops into your head while your trying to sleep, but in general, even adults can appreciate the folklore and mysticism of these short stories.For any lover of urban legends, folklore, ghost stories, or paranormal, I'd definitely recommend this for a read."
2,This book was boring.,This book is boring because it doesn't have a lot of entertainment.Also this is realy dumd who will ever read this. I can not read this book cause I will go to sleep like nothing. This book is so dumd my friend hugo wont even read this boring book.
2,SORT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT,"If you really like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS the television show than you'll love this video. You'll love it because it's more like a collection of old clips that we've already seen on T.V. with a clip or two of nudity. However to be fair, the new and uncensored clips were quite funny (I found myself laughing aloud a couple of times). But I felt a little cheated that I brought it. So I would suggest renting it if you can. If not and you have some spare dollars than buy it for a couple of laughs."
4,We were rolling in our seats!,"During some parts, my husband and I couldn't contain ourselves! This dvd is great! We didn't see the TV version very often, maybe that's why almost everything we saw was new. But, about 20% of it wasn't all that funny, though."
1,not for anyone who wants to learn bass,"it's hard to describe how bad this DVD is. i will never get back the $15.00 i paid for it. and donating it to the library is out of the question, because i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from learning bass..."
5,Definitely More than Your Money's Worth,"You cannot expect more with this price. Line 6 Spider III provides multiple inner effects which allow you to save the budget for those extremely expensive effect pedals. I use Fender Stratocaster myself, and was really impressed by the distortion sound generated by Spider III even without other effect pedals. If you are not at a professional level and are looking for a balanced and stable amplifier, you definitely do not want to miss it."
3,Call me a cynic,"Great price for an amp with effects, and it gets pretty loud too. Easy to use, which may seem odd to mention for some who hasn't shopped for an amp, but trust me it makes a difference. Sound quality is... well, not as good as everything else I've mentioned. First, before anyone goes naysaying, I'm not playing on a squier or something, I'm playing on a PRS SE, and I've been to guitar center manhattan, and I tried every amp with this guitar. At 15w, this was among the best overall, but the clean on this amp is atrocious. It sounds hollow and tinny, and yes, I am accepting that I only paid 100 bucks for this, and yes, it is only 15 w, but other amps outperformed its clean setting. And most people will be using that the most."
2,horrible sound,"This amp has bad sound. wish i bought a vox pathfinder for $20 more. theres one good thing, it has a line out so you can record song ideas to your computer."
4,Very nice guitar amp for a beginner,"As a novice electric guitar player I like this amp because of its features and price. The thing that drives me nuts is that I'm having to fiddle with the channel volume and master volume button every time I cycle the power. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, or maybe that's how this is (or other guitar amps are) supposed to work, but I dislike how it needs this type of ""resetting""."
4,What's Not To Like?,"After looking at a gazillion amps on-line, I settled on this one because of the reviews that I read on ALL different brands, and this one stood out for me the most. I was going to go for the Spider IV, but it was about $32.00 more. The IV has a built in tuner, and a few other bells and whistles that I really can live without, which is why I went with the III. I only gave it 4 stars because I couldn't justify giving it 5 stars due to the fact that nothing in this world is perfect. Except maybe Eric Clapton, when he's playing the guitar. :)"
2,Key Bob,"Item was recieved with Ford instructions when item was bought for a GM product. Called there service line for assistance but was put on hold for 10 minutes then I hung up. Item i'm sure works but as far as it being "" Do-It-Yourself Programming "" i'm not sure about that."
3,Interesting and a little dated,It's a fun watch from a movie history and special effects perspective. The actors are great and believable and the special effects are fun.Not as scary as I remembered it!
5,poltergeist,"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy."
3,An Antiquated Rocket for Flight Photography,"The Estes Astrocam is a fairly easy rocket to build and fly. It requires some gluing, assembly, and fixing of decals. I suppose the whole process takes 2 hours or so.The camera is mounted on the nosecone and is a fixed focus lens. It takes 110 film, which in the digital age is a real pain to find and process. This is the major drawback of this rocket - the 100 film.I have had multiple problems loading the film, getting the film to advance, and problems with the camera itself. I do not recommend this rocket camera any longer.The 110 film format has a tiny negative, so standard enlargements of your astrophotos are not feasible beyond a 4x5 picture. The pictures (if you get a roll of 110 film to work in the camera) tend to be blurry and are overall disappointing.Adding photography to rocketry is a fun and worthwhile addition to this interesting hobby, but this rocket IS NOT the place to start!Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
3,You don't buy this album for the music,"You buy it for Reed's Lenny Bruce styled rants. They're hilarious and you will enjoy hearing them and playing them for your friends. You won't play the album to enjoy Reed's excellent music. For that try ""Rock and Roll Animal"" (one of the finest live albums recorded of anyone!) or if you already have that, then the Live in Italy cd. So you buy it for the humor, Lou cursing Robert Christgau among many others, that's great, but by all reports much of that has been edited out. I wonder what Lou-then would have said about this release? I say Nuts!"
3,lou reed- take no prisioners,"It's a weird live concert, in which lou is very much under drug effects and keeps talking and insulting, laughing, screeming, pull anothers leg. well in fact, If you like weird things about lou reed as the metal machine, this is defenetly a Master Opera. you must have it"
2,"""Give me an issue and I'll give you a tissue.....""",The other reviews are pretty much on the mark. This early Binaural recording is wasted on a sloppy (and I'm being kind) performance of Lou essentially ignoring his band and venting/rapping for the duration. For completests or comedy fans only.
5,Kiln formed braclet,"I just got introduced to glass fusion. This book is for the more advanced student. All in all, this book will come in handy when I mmove on. Great book to have in the glass library! I bought yhis book from Amazon."
4,A Good Historical Overview,"Most Anglos think of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna as the villian of the Alamo, but when viewed as a whole, the Alamo was just another incident in the life of this colorful and still controversial figure. Santa Anna's rise to power begins at the time of the filibusters and ends with his return from forced exile in the the late 1870's. In between, the ""Napoleon of the South"" made Mexican history. From political intrigue, wars, European conflicts and ""perfidious foreignors"" in Texas, Santa Anna left an indellable impression. Vain, arrogant, foolhardy, calculating, charming, determined and, at times, deceitful, you either loved him or hated him."
3,Remix album -- It's No Good!,"Depeche Mode has been my favorite band since 1985. I eagerly anticipate anything and everything new that comes out directly from them and even tribute albums. As one of the bands who pioneered the creation and inclusion of remixes, you'd think they'd have higher standards than this. Way too many of these remixes are just 6-8 minutes of drum beat with the lead vocal track sort of distorted in the background. Little if anything new or revulolutionary in terms of approaches to these songs to be heard here. Not horrible, a few good ones, but mainly a bunch of mediocre re-treads. I agree that for many of these songs, there are MUCH better remixes to be had. Not sure why they didn't get included here."
2,Poor quality release!,"What's happening with depeche mode??Why do they release this kind of material?Leave this for professional remix bootlegers.....50% of the mixes are very bad, the other half are good or acceptable, almost all the third disc new mixes are awfull indeed.@Depeche Mode......please release something interesting and worth of your history as a quality band.Release some new live material like WVT 90 material, or a demos-outtakes cd or even better: A New Album! :)thanks."
1,excruciating,"It's like sitting in a maths lesson that never ends, and succeeds only in making you *really dislike* Depeche Mode and their constituent parts. Corny, clinical (and not in a good way ie 'industrial', 'minimal' or 'glassy' or something) nasal 90s music with dire self-aware sleevenotes and some lazy photoshop cover art no doubt done by someone called 'Ben' on an apple mac.Can you imagine the sort of crowd that woulkd actually pay to see this band? Pious old 40 and 50-somethings who would no doubt berate their bored kids about how great the 80s was.Ugh, horrifying on every level."
2,there's a fly on the windscreen,"Started off good with Never Let Me Down Again..promises me I'm as safe as houses :)Then DM got lost in these poor selection of remixes.Older DM mixed tracks are still preferred.Still looking for the elusive It's Called A Heart ""slow mix""."
3,Sólo para abs-fans,"sí. sólo si eres un fan absoluto de depeche. sólo si no puedes permitir ni oir una crítica negativa sobre ellos. sólo en ese caso merece que te hagas con el cd. lo escuchas y es lo mismo que ya tienes en los lps originales. ah, también puede ser útil para quien acaba de entrar en el ""dm world"" y se quiere hacer de golpe con ""todo""."
2,same ole. same ole,"I'm a BIG dMode fan, but these songs have already been released in the past. nothing impressive. A lot of the remixes are already on the import albums"
2,Mostly modern Club DJ style mixes not original mixes,"These mixes are not the ones I would have compiled into a box set. Overall the mixes lacked the artistic value that I enjoy from Depeche Mode songs and mixes.I decided to buy these despite the negative reviews I read on Amazon, I should have taken the negative reviews into greater consideration. I have listened to these CDs over and over trying to see if they will grow on me and I can't say that they have.Unless you know the versions and the DJ's style (and like them) I would pass on these remixes and get the ones on the Singles box sets instead."
3,Not Very Much New Material Here,"I'm disappointed, once more. The only decent remix is the rework of Photographic on Disc 3. Other than that, pretty boring throughtout; we've heard this all before. I wish they included ""Fools"" remix while they were at it."
2,Weak Mode Remixes,"As a big fan of Mode, and a big fan of remixes, this ""rare"" compilation of remixes is very disappointing. I used to have Depeche Mode singles and remixes on vinyl and tape - many of which, had awesome beats, and clever reworked material...those tunes don't seem to be here.Whoever produced this compilation must not have been a fan of the band because so much better Mode material exists out there.If you're a big fan of the band, and enjoy their remixed material, I suggest going with their Single Box set(s) instead."
4,Beautiful film with strong performances,Hard Luck's main strength is its performances. Mainly of the lead actor Kirk Harris who gives the film a tragic yet hopeful feel. It is about the importance of friendship and family over anything.
5,2006 project,1) How to Destroy a Relationship2) Sleep Deprivation3) Hey Lou Reed4) Save Me Now5) Moonbeams6) Brains7) Hey Do You Feel Good?8) (I Should Be Your) Girlfriend9) I Wish I Could Stop Wishing for Things10) On Your Knees Kid11) Out of Phase
3,Some like it and some don't,I bought two of these for friends and one for myself. My friends say they love theirs - keeps their cell phones handy and they love the fashionable patterns. When I used mine my cell phone kept falling out of the case so I was always worrying about that and finally stopped using it. It might be O.K. if your phone/camera/MP3 fit snugly in it.
1,Didn't work,"I had bad swelling in my legs and feet during my pregnancy. I thought this might help, but it didn't."
4,Not Bad,"I bought this book for a class on ethics. It was very dull to have to read, but it did contain some very useful information about famous cases relating to ethical and legal problems (e.g. intelligence testing with diverse populations, reproductive rights of people with disabilities, crossing ethical boundaries, etc.). Not a bad book for someone studying law or any social science. You just have to get over the fact that the writing is very very dry and boring."
5,The best yet - you have to hear it!,"This is by far the tightest and most honest representation of the band. It even manages to capture the essence of the live show (which is another adventure entirely). While the digipak that it comes in is restrictive in terms of liner notes, etc., it is a cool and eco-friendly way of packaging a disc. Obviously, all material that would have been included in a fat booklet is available at the GT website (which is printed on the disc). The production of the recording is first class, and I would encourage anyone who likes music (especially horns) to check it out NOW!!"
3,you get what you pay for....,"This is a pretty decent monitor, but after using it for 2 weeks, i'm returning it. The main reason is after rebooting linux (which is rare) i got the startup screen and noticed about 8 bad pixels. The other thing is, I didnt realize that this monitor doesnt have DVI output until I opened it up, which is why this monitor goes for $100 less than comparable monitors.- bad pixels- no DVI+ decent image for analog inputs"
3,3 1/2 years then it died.,"I bought this in late 2007 and it worked fine until today (4-29-11). The power light flashes amber then green and the screen remains black. I have a dual-monitor system and switched the other one and it worked fine on the same video card plug as the bad one, thus determining that the monitor itself is indeed the problem.Interesting that it came with a 3 year warranty and here we are 3 1/2 years later. Planned obselescence? Perhaps, but I want things that last a long time. I suppose I'll have to spend more money and pray this time if I want that."
3,Good for the price,"I've owned this monitor for 3 years and this morning it quit on me. It now just flashes on and off and nothing I do can reset it. 3 years is a long time but there's no reason a monitor shouldn't last at least 5. I'm disappointed in it's stamina for sure. As to it's funtion, works great out of the box. Decent image, it's only a 1680X1050 res so it's not the clearest picture. I haven't had any problems with this until now. 8ms response time is great. All in all not a bad purchase and would probably have done it again if I had to do all over again."
3,Help me! Help me!,"Ha, ha! I laugh every time I hear that! This movie is way better than that Jeff Goldblum wanna-be. Help me! Help me! Ha, ha!"
1,Seriously?,I read from other reviewers that this stuff will clean the daylights out of my anodized aluminum pans.They are all wrong. You will have to scrub like mad with or without this stuff. I don't think it made any difference in the effort or result.Just use a scouring pad and some hot soapy water.
1,Totally Useless! Waste of Money!,"I bought this with the intention that it would work as stated, since it is a Calphlon product. However, much to my dismay it DID NOT take away the dime-sized brown spot on the bottom of one of my Calphalon anodized pots. It also did not make the outside of the pots 'look like new'. I scrubbed and scrubbed with no results of removing the spot at all. My money went down the sink drain along with this useless product."
1,Poor. Lousy. Waste of money,Worthless. It didn't clean the bott om of the pans never have any problems with the insides. I want a product that takes cooking dark spots off.
1,Doesn't work.,"Doesn't work, period, unless I'm completely incompetent, and I know I'm not! I've tried it every which way, when the pan was cold, warm, hot. In all cases, there wasn't any noteworthy result. I'm disappointed because I like my hard-anodized pans, but I don't like them with stains :-("
3,I've fallen out of love,"This show had it all, a good cast, excellent writing, wonderful concept--mysterious setting, riddles and even a monster (of sorts)---which carried it through 3 action packed, tightly executed seasons. The cracks began appearing (to me anyway) in Season 4. The show started getting sloppy (not to say it didn't have its moments, just not as consistently high in quality), but I thought that the production team had surprised me before and maybe there was a method to the madness---but then Season 5.Lapsing into tired Science Fiction cliches and temples in the jungle that could have been pulled out of old Tarzan movies just didn't cut it for me.It stings to fall on to this side of the fence---I was a true believer.I'll limp through Season 6 with lowered expectations, wistfully wondering what could have been if they hadn't run out of gas."
